But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Crowe The captain of the ship plays violin and heroically fights the enemy. 20th Century Fox But compared with most screen seafaring adventures -- and especially those with hefty price tags -- this mystically entertaining adaptation of Patrick OBrians popular novels does have eccentricities. Weir attained international stature by directing the subliminally spooky The Last Wave and Picnic at Hanging Rock in the 70s. This movie which is likely to be sold in part as ""Russell Crowes latest"" is in some ways a welcome throwback albeit on a much grander scale. More about the movie Master and Commander The Far Side of the World    1/2 stars out of four Stars Russell Crowe Paul Bettany Billy Boyd James DArcy Director Peter Weir Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for intense battle sequences related images and brief language Opens today nationwide Were in Napoleonic territory 1805 and Britains HMS Surprise is ordered to keep a larger French ship from escalating the war. Crowe the movies one star in a story with only fleeting appearances by women plays the Surprises sensitive captain still proud that years before Lord Horatio Nelson spoke to him a few times. With his best friend and the ships doctor accompanying on cello (Paul Bettany in a performance some will say steals the show) he even plays classical violin. Yet action fans neednt fidget. There are battle scenes at the beginning and end a flogging a storm and surgeries bordering on the bizarre. Unlike past saltwater sagas we not only see stacked-up casualties on the deck but also the repair work below. Another fresh angle is the chill that envelops the ship after an indispensable crewmember has been seriously wounded. And try to recall a non-nature film that drifts over to the Galapagos Islands. The cat-and-mouse between the Surprise and its adversary is suspenseful and not a little mysterious as the French ship is as likely to appear out of a mist as it is to be in plain sight. Instead of Butch and Sundance saying ""Who are those guys?"" this is more like ""What is that thing?"" Weir knows how to creep us out. Crowe delivers the star turn an epic with no romantic angle needs and its his second consecutive performance (after A Beautiful Mind) to better his Oscar-winning role in Gladiator. You keep expecting this captain to show a dark side but hes just a plain old good guy. And novel insights notwithstanding this is a plain old good movie too. For an ambitious undertaking that could provide a marketing challenge it ought to find fans among the young and the old and both genders.

Starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. Directed by Peter Weir. (PG-13. 138 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" a seafaring adventure set at the time of the Napoleonic Wars has epic scale and atmosphere plus a first-rate director in Peter Weir. The film contains brilliantly crafted scenes and shots that are as compelling as anything seen onscreen this year but there are also dull stretches in which the movie seems lightweight -- never in its execution but in its conception. This is a difficult film to talk about because the things that are great about it are easily identifiable while its failings are pervasive but vague. The simplest way to put it is that for all the movies coarse grandeur -- for all the blood in its battle scenes and the grim historical accuracy of its depiction of antediluvian medical procedures -- the story of ""Master and Commander"" feels like something intended not for adults but for children. As such the movies bigness sometimes seems feels inappropriate and its sober attention to history more than its story deserves. Yet if these elements throw the movie out of balance so be it for theyre also precisely whats good about ""Master and Commander."" I only wish the movies fluffy aura could have been smothered entirely by the productions size. This one might have been a classic. It sure starts well with shots of a gleaming British battleship in the middle of a calm sea with nothing around it. Nothing is happening. Its just another morning. The shots emphasize the peacefulness of the open water and also the ships aloneness in it. From that point on we never forget the surrounding ocean. When the battles come we are aware -- in a way that were not with other films -- that the ship is everything. When the cannon fire bombards them and the deck is slippery with blood the men have to fight not because theyre such tough guys but because they have nowhere else to go. At the heart of ""Master and Commander"" is a friendship between two men of opposing temperaments. Russell Crowe plays Jack Aubrey the captain of the HMS Surprise a hard-drinking hairy-armed sort of fellow instinctive brave and decisive. His best friend is the ships doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany) a man of science and intellect a humanist and a thinker. Maturin is the only one who can tell Aubrey hes wrong. He tells Aubrey hes wrong even when hes right. The characters were created by novelist Patrick OBrian over the course of 20 books dealing with the Napoleonic Wars. The first was called ""Master and Commander."" The film takes its story mainly from the 10th novel in the series ""The Far Side of the World""; hence the cumbersome title. Captain Jack has been assigned to stop a French warship from reaching Asia but he finds out the hard way that his ship is slower and outgunned. His officers want him to turn back but he decides to keep going across the South Atlantic and around Cape Horn. In every scene with little or no dialogue in which Weirs skill as a director can be appreciated in isolation ""Master and Commander"" is a great movie. Weir lends an extraordinary sense of place to the battle scenes. We feel the confinement of the space and understand what it would be like to be there. A perfect example of what this director can do comes in the scene in which a boy gets his arm amputated. Weir in fact shows nothing and yet makes manages to make an entire audience squirm. The director also has the wisdom to open the film up and let it breathe in a sequence within which Maturin strolls around the Galapagos Islands investigating wildlife. Weir is less surefooted as a screenwriter. Having not read any of OBrians novels I cant say if the fault is in Weirs adaptation or in the source material but halfway into ""Master and Commander"" the friendship of the captain and the doctor begins to seem schematic as if all the positive traits that an individual could have were divided equally between these two guys just so they can argue. Their interaction takes on a preening quality reminiscent of the interaction of the ""Star Trek"" characters four or five movies down the line. We come to realize that the specific adventure matters little except as a showcase for these personalities. Once that happens the story involving the French ship loses much of its interest and all of its danger and the movie starts taking on water. ""Master and Commander"" stays afloat to the finish but thats all that can be said. -- Advisory Violence lots of blood and some strong language.

"Aye aye captain - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Orlando Sentinel Aye aye captain Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic  Peter Weirs Master and Commander is a thrilling sweeping visually stunning Napoleonic War adventure set on the high seas.Its a beautiful film full of blood heart intelligence and wit. It may very well turn out to be the best picture of the year but it is already the best historical epic since Last of the Mohicans and the best movie under sail ever made. Freely adapted from the 20-novel Patrick OBrian series about a Royal Navy captain Jack Aubrey and his spy-naturalist-physician friend Stephen Maturin the film follows the Royal Navy frigate HMS Surprise on a round-the-world chase after a huge and deadly French privateer.They battle off Brazil. They struggle around Cape Horn.They duel off the Galapagos.And as they do we are immersed in the cramped difficult and downright deadly business of sailing a man-of-war in the 19th century.We see through the eyes of the landlubberly amateur naturalist Maturin a trifle underplayed by Paul Bettany the wonders of the Galapagos half a century before Darwin. That this amazing visit -- the first time a feature film has been shot in those unique isles -- is but an interlude in the broader sweep of the film says something of the sheer scale of Master and Commander.What Weir and his co-adapter John Collee have done is absorb OBrians novels which are the lifes journey of a seaman and a scientist and pick up the tale at its most exciting juncture. In 1805 the future of Europe hung in the balance. After many defeats on land only the Royal Navy was keeping Napoleon at bay.Russell Crowe stars as Capt. ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey a bluff hard-drinking hard-driving gambler of a warrior with one eye on his duty and the other on the main chance ""the prize"" the glory and riches of capturing an enemy vessel. Fans of the novels may quibble that Crowes Aubrey isnt OBrians simple socially inept sailor at home only in battle. But Crowe wears the role as if he were born to it. He dominates the frame the way John Wayne did the way Charlton Heston thought he did.""Heroic"" is the only way to describe this performance. As amazing as the former Gladiator is in a fight Crowe is never better than in his many scenes with the ships youngest crew members -- the vessels ""squeakers"" young powder monkeys and midshipmen.Bettany Crowes Beautiful Mind castmate is an intriguing choice for Maturin. The novels suggest a shorter plainer-looking brooding drug-abusing man so totally out of his depth on a ship that he is forever falling overboard. The crew at times dotes on the great doctor and scientist as if he were retarded. Weir has rubbed off the comical the Irish and the laudanum- and coca-abusing edges.But Bettany is perfectly right in one important way He and Crowe dont have to fake knowing each other for years. From their arguments over the Navys tyrannical discipline and its ""there isnt a moment to lose"" hurry skipping by the natural wonders of the world to their perhaps over-perfect violin and cello duets in the cabin after the evenings often boisterous and drunken dinners they have history.Theres humor and much of the wondrous texture of the novels.""To our wives and sweet- hearts . . . may they never meet.""Sea chanteys are sung seamanship is debated and displayed and life and death decisions grimly reached in moments of truth.The battles are ferocious and visceral. This isnt a Pirates of the Caribbean lark. You will feel the recoil of the cannons duck the whizzing cannonballs and splinters.Theres no Hollywood romance no women in the story at all. But Weirs gutsiest decision was not to dumb this thing down to give the audience an easy entree to the story. Follow along let the visuals and emotions and pacing sweep you up. And if need be get a fan of the books or of Aamp;Es fine Horatio Hornblower miniseries to fill you in on the rest.Many of the films pitched as ""epics"" in recent years simply havent had the look. The cinematography and editing that characterized Lawrence of Arabia and the other films of David Lean has seemed a dead art. Who has the time to wait for that perfect shot anymore especially on a 135 million movie? However sweeping and satisfying the Lord of the Rings films or Braveheart and Gladiator have been however ""big"" Titanic was none of those films have looked frame by frame like art. Master and Commander does.The special effects dont reveal themselves as such. Cinematographer Russell Boyd who hasnt done work this gorgeous since 1981s Gallipoli and the editors and designers give every shot a burnished hue. A seamans life was this gray and brown world of wood and water and canvas and occasionally blood and the production teams attention to this restricted color palette is as gutsy as Weirs decision to join the story mid-chase.Like The Lord of the Rings Master and Commander rides into theaters on a wave of expectations based on the very popular novels it comes from. Fellow fans of the novels you wont be disappointed. And for those of you who havent discovered what are widely acclaimed as the best historical novels ever written this great film is just a glorious hint of what youve been missing.Roger Moore can be reached at Rmooreorlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5369.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 13 2003 711 PM Naval Gazing Peter Weirs swashbuckling Master and Commander. By David Edelstein Fun on the high seas The national mood could hardly be more right for Peter Weirs Master and Commander The Far Side of the World (20th Century Fox) a rousing and magnificently crafted 19th-century warship saga that handily dispenses with pesky questions about ulterior motives civil liberties and recalcitrant indigenous populations that bedevil our countrys present-day engagements. Oh to be in England when the seas were high the seamen higher and the enemy plundering Frenchmen--led by Napoleon Bonaparte bent on lining Piccadilly Circus with guillotines. See you in hell first rude Frog Its 1803 onboard the HMSSurprise and Capt. Jack Aubrey (a manly Russell Crowe in a blond ponytail) is awakened by a young officer who might have glimpsed a fearsome French frigate through a frogbank--I mean fogbank. Before we see Crowes face we see his boots his sword and his belt buckle which locks into place with the satisfying clank of steel against steel. Then he strides onto the deck and peers into the sea mist as stalwart a captain as any in Christendom--and his crew knows it too every man-jack. We see the flash of a distant cannon before we hear the boom and Aubrey yells ""DOWN"" as a ball rips through the mizzenmast. He cries ""Stand tall on the quarterdeck"" and ""Lay me alongside at pistol range"" and ""Hold steady boys Courage now"" And I daresay I was with him and I daresay so will you be every man-jack woman-jack and little-kid-jack. Advertisement Weir has loosely adapted the 10th book of the late Patrick OBrians 20-part adventure series which friends of mine have been rhapsodizing over for at least a decade. Seven years ago at their prodding I managed to get through the first volume and portions of the second but all I can remember are whole pages about knots; and with my landlubbers impatience I had a hard time keeping hold of the narrative. But Gods my life I enjoyed that seafaring patois--and so must have Weir. He and his co-screenwriter John Collee have kept OBrians relish for antiquated English nautical talk and veritable fetish for antiquated nautical bric-a-brac. The shots might be cluttered with ropes and pulleys and masts and mizzenmasts but the storytelling is lean and shapely--even with long stretches in which the swashbuckling stops and the characters debate the up- and downsides of their military adventurism. Master and Commander hooks you from its nifty opening salvo to its nifty closing punch line. That salvo it turns out comes from a newfangled French supership called the Acheron; and the film that follows consists of Aubreys Surprise alternately running away from the thing or chasing it around Cape Horn to prevent it from sinking or pillaging more of His Majestys ships. Aubrey nicknamed Lucky Jack is simultaneously lost in admiration for the phantom French captain (never shown at least until the final moments) and vexed by the way in which the Surprise is constantly surprised. Hell go to the ends of the Earth to stop the Acheron with the lone check on his authority his pal Stephen Maturin the ships doctor played by the charismatic Paul Bettany--who was Crowes imaginary friend in A Beautiful Mind (2001) but who functions here amusingly enough as the voice of reality. As Aubrey drives his small and ramshackle ship--with boys on board who look barely pubescent--through scarily raging storms and even more scarily windless calms Weir hints that the captain is becoming something of an Ahab in his quest for the Acheron. Truth be told though hes only mildly obsessed only gingerly Ahab-esque. This is one level-headed martinet. A king-and-country authoritarian he counsels an unpopular midshipman Hollom (Lee Ingleby) against befriending the crew--men need governing he maintains--yet quickly adds that one must never be a tyrant either. (When he orders a sailor flogged for insubordination he seems pretty squarely within his 19th-century rights.) Dr. Maturin meanwhile is a humanist who nonetheless understands the necessity of occasionally slicing people up for non-medical reasons. Taken together the pair embodies just the sort of balanced exquisitely nuanced military that ought to be the rule instead of the (fictional) exception--and Crowe and Bettany are extremely comfortable together. (Or perhaps its that were comfortable seeing them together.) As Aubrey and Maturin debate the finer points of their mission while sawing away on a violin and cello you can see how OBrian influenced Star Trek The Next Generation with its French-English-liberal-humanist-authoritarian aesthete Capt. Jean-Luc Picard--who also flirted with Ahabism but so guiltily that the actor Patrick Stewart had to make a TV-movie of Moby Dick to get the role out of his system. There are other ways in which the film of Master and Commander will remind Trekkies that for all the loopy sci-fi contrivances in that series its the naval-adventure template that holds it together. This is the ur-Star Trek. Here too a captain barks out ""Damage report"" and the exchange of information that follows is gratifyingly lickety-split. Here too is a spirit of wonder on a planet that in the early 19th century seemed almost as vast and unknowable as our galaxy does now. In the second half the HMSSurprise arrives in the Galapagos where Maturin begs the captain to let him linger and carry back a sampling of never-before-seen (but ancient) species We are led to believe that had the Acheron not sailed lumberingly into view and the call of science been rudely elbowed aside by the call of war then Darwinism would be uh Maturinity. Weir often brings a dash of artiness and a liberal conscience to what are essentially high-toned genre films The Last Wave (1977) Witness (1985) Dead Poets Society (1989) Green Card (1990) etc. This is a genre film too with martial fervor finally swamping any larger questions about Englands own none-too-savory imperialism The movies point of view is in Aubreys misty eyes when he speaks of Adm. Lord Nelson (""With Nelson you felt your heart glow ...""). For all its ruminative patches Master and Commander lacks that measure of ambivalence We grieve for the men who fall but never doubt that this war or any war backed by elites the caliber of Aubrey and Maturin is often imperative--or as Aubrey puns watching insects writhe on a dinner plate the lesser of two weevils. That might not be enough to put this up there with the greatest war movies but given the thrilling Dolby-ized sound-scape and JMW Turner compositions and wonderfully evocative old Navy-speak youll hardly care. Even confirmed peaceniks will regard Master and Commander as a necessary weevil. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

"Master and Commander Heavy On the Ballast washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Master and Commander Heavy On the Ballast Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 14 2003 A good rule of thumb is avoid movies with colons in the title. A colon connotes equal weight for both halves of the entity surrounding it. In other words someone namely the author hasnt been able to make up his mind which half is more important. He hasnt discriminated -- and that after all is his job. And thus the much ballyhooed and ultra-handsome ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" suffers from what might be called colonitis. It comprises too many equal parts and they tangle each other up. Everything is important which comes to mean that nothing is important. Derived from two novels in the famed Patrick OBrian series set aboard a British man-of-war during the Napoleonic era it also pulls in snatches from other OBrian books and additions from the imaginations of director Peter Weir and his co-scenarist John Collee. Lots of material but nobody has done much discriminating. Thus the thing feels weirdly overstuffed as stories keep stumbling into and over one another or are buried beneath the arrival of other stories. The worst example is the films narrative framework -- a long cat-and-mouse sea hunt between the British ship HMS Surprise and a faster meaner bigger Frenchy called the Acheron that is presented in the early going as a matter of utmost almost overwhelming importance. But if its so important why does Weir keep shunting it aside even losing contact with it as other lesser stories take precedence? He even puts the hunt for the devious Acheron on pause to make room for a bird-watching expedition Only when the bird-watcher stumbles upon the Acheron at harbor does Weir remember what the movie is about. The center of the OBrian novels is the relationship between two men the indomitable man of war Capt. Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and his ships surgeon amateur naturalist and in the books at least intelligence agent Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany). So in sync are the two very different minds -- Jacks is action-oriented direct noble; Stephens is subtle ironic witty -- that they make beautiful music together on the Surprises afterdeck. But as beautiful as the music is and as experienced as the actors are with each other (they related brilliantly in ""A Beautiful Mind"") the truth here is that neither shows particularly well. Crowe is outsize in the old movie-star fashion a stern face a stout body a formidable presence but the movie idealizes Jack Aubrey to a somewhat irritating degree Not only is he brilliant brave and inspirational but hes also inspirational brilliant and brave. Plus he plays a mean fiddle gives great speeches and is handy with a sword. But on the downside hes -- oops they left the downside out of the film (but not out of the books where Aubrey frequently displays an importunate randy streak expressed on the wives of various Brit officials in ports of call). The movie makes him into a Sgt. Rock of the Royal Navy though I suppose that would make him Capt. Rock. So the character isnt nearly as persuasive as a more subtly shaded darker evocation might have been. As for Bettany this was to be the picture that would make him a star and it wont. The movie is so pitched to Crowe that Bettany doesnt imprint with any singularity and certainly not with anything like the power and charm he brought to both ""A Beautiful Mind"" and his first widely seen film ""A Knights Tale"" where he so amusingly played the publicity agent and wrytyr Geoff Chaucer. As it wanders about the globe windblown and drifty the movie does find a good subplot now and then. The best of these has to do with the presence of young men -- very young -- on these ships as midshipmen preparing for a life at sea. The precocious among them are given yet more onerous responsibility which leads to certain astonishments. The hero-boy of the Surprise ends up one-armed and at the tender age of 13 leading wizened tattooed sailors in hand-to-hand combat when the Surprise finally does surprise the Acheron. The young actor Max Perkis who plays Midshipman Lord Blakeney is terrific in the part easily the master and commander of his elders. Then theres the ship itself. As has been well publicized the movie company actually built a replica and floated it in a famous Mexican movie tank (where both ""The Abyss"" and ""Titanic"" were shot). So one thing ""Master and Commander etc etc"" is long on is a sense of shipboard life in the early 19th century and hey if thats what you want then this is where you go. Its a maze of chambers and byways of dense riggings (theres a whole universe of rope to be mastered) and canvas walls of creaking and grinding and groaning slats. The Surprise feels as much like a living thing as any of its crew. And then theres war. The movie begins with battle and closes with battle. Its a shame the first one is so powerful and the last one so generic; it ought to be the other way around. But that first fight when the Acheron opens fire from a fog bank -- loved the sudden flashes breaking out of the white wall of vapor -- and the French heavy ball tears into the Surprises wooden hull and what it strikes it converts by shots deadly alchemy into shrapnel is immediate and terrifying. Suddenly were in a wooden Verdun where the very air seems alive with death. Wow It has to be the best naval battle sequence ever gotten onto film and totally as terrifying as Weirs brilliant re-creation of the crucible of ""Gallipoli."" Alas the last engagement lacks the immediacy and the singularity of the first. If youve seen any of the great swashbucklers of the Errol Flynn era such as ""Captain Blood"" or ""The Sea Hawk"" it will feel as good as but no better than any of them. Its familiar stuff not made particularly raw or real the grappling hooks the clank of sabers and cutlasses the weirdly unloud poofs of the muskets. I didnt hear ""Shiver me timbers"" or a ""Yo-ho-ho"" but if I had it wouldnt have seemed out of place. I kept waiting for Johnny Depp to swing over on a yardarm. In the end ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" seems fated to disappoint everyone except the slick magazines that put it on their covers. The cognoscenti who have memorized the OBrian novels will pull out their hair at the liberties taken the plots and incidents meshed together haphazardly. The Aubrey-innocent who dont know the difference between a topgallant and a preventer backstay will just wonder what the fuss is about. Master and Commander The Far Side of the World (138 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for battle sequences bloody surgery and occasional cursing.

Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Movies Russell Crowe or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" is a masterful and majestic film that leaps off the screen. The film set during the Napoleonic Wars and based on a series of novels by Patrick OBrian is beautifully crafted by director Peter Weir and superbly acted by Russell Crowe Paul Bettany and an exceptional supporting cast. Its also so true to life -- something vitally important to OBrians fans -- you can almost taste the sea spray splashing on to the deck. Indeed ""Master and Commander"" has an almost obsessive determination for historical accuracy. Every detail from the the ropes used on the masts to the silverware used by the ships officers appears authentic. Almost all of the action takes place at sea (actually in the same water tank in Baja California used for ""Titanic"") and you can really feel the claustrophobic atmosphere on the small British ship the HMS Surprise. Crowe and Bettany -- united again after their Oscar-winning film ""A Beautiful Mind"" -- play respectively Capt. Jack Aubrey the commander of the Surprise and his best friend the ships doctor Stephen Maturin. Their mission is to capture or destroy a French battle ship the Acheron. This results in a high-stakes race across two oceans as Aubrey risks his crew and his ship in a relentless pursuit that could easily end in disaster. Expertise Paul Bettany who plays Dr. Stephen Maturin is a perfect match for Crowe. The film begins and ends with major battles at sea. In the first encounter Aubrey is taken unawares by the Acheron and his ship is badly damaged. Afterward his crew assumes theyll be heading home but Capt. Aubrey has other plans. Although the Surprise is desperately in need of repairs and the Acheron has twice the men and twice the guns Aubrey is determined to bring the enemy down. His single-mindedness drives the action from the coast of Brazil around Cape Horn and on to the Galapagos Islands. The second encounter between the Surprise and the Acheron is the films climax and you can probably guess the results. In addition to being the films director Weir is a producer and the co-screenwriter along with John Collee. Collee is also a medical doctor so his expertise helped shape the scenes involving Bettanys character. Small touches The battle scenes in ""Master and Commander"" dont make up much of the movie but pack a punch. As always Crowe grabs the screen and never lets go. But the casting of Bettany was equally important because hes gifted enough to go toe-to-toe with Crowe and hold his own on screen. In many ways this big epic film is really a small drama about the relationship between these two men. Their friendship is a study in contrasts Aubrey is a larger-than-life man of action very much a man of his time while Maturin is more modern a forward-thinking intellectual who chooses his words and actions very carefully. Special kudos should also go to 13-year-old Max Pirkis who plays midshipman Lord Blakeney. His character is a main player in this story and Pirkis pulls it off with aplomb. It should be noted that since we never see the enemy up close -- except for a couple of short scenes the French ship is always a distant evil force that drives the action on board the Surprise -- all the drama and tension takes place on the British ship where the men battle not only the French but also their own fears and superstitions. So while promoted as an ""action/epic"" ""Master and Commander"" also has the innate feeling of a character-driven drama. Thats not to say the action sequences arent exciting. The clashes at sea are brilliantly filmed and quite colorful. But the characters and dialogue are much much richer and more detailed then your average high-sea adventure flick. In the crowded ocean of Oscar wannabes ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" may or may not have the sea legs to grab the gold but its a film well worth seeing. One note for OBrian fans Though bits and pieces of the story come from many of the authors 20 Aubrey books the main sources were the novels ""Master And Commander"" and ""The Far Side of the World"" -- hence the films long title. ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" opens nationwide on Friday November 14 and is rated PG-13.

The movie adapted from the popular historical novels by Patrick OBrian and directed by Peter Weir is bookended by two hard-working but listless sea battles. In between it plays -- astonishingly for an accredited shock jock like Weir -- like an earnest National Geographic mockup striving to give us the flavor of periods and places past. Weir has been known to go high-minded (Dead Poets Society) or silly (Green Card) on us but it is hard to recognize the inflamed imagination behind Picnic at Hanging Rock Gallipoli or even The Truman Show in this tame early-19th-century buddy movie. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Russell Crowe and British actor Paul Bettany star as intrepid sea captain Jack Aubrey and his brainy ships doctor Stephen Maturin who are charged with bringing honor -- though not quite as much honor as the captain craves -- to England by taking out one of Napoleons men-of-war which has all but sunk the good ship Surprise early on in the movie. Crowe and Bettany were heaps more fun as a psychotic mathematician and his fantasy toy-boy in A Beautiful Mind than they are as this pair of old biddies. Nag-nagging one another to follow the ethics of their respective callings while playing tasteful duets on string instruments the two guffaw their way through dinner parties in the officers mess where Aubrey delights his adoring inferiors by dropping terrible puns and wherever humanly possible dropping the name of his former boss Lord Nelson. Though by most reliable accounts OBrians novels are elegantly written Weirs screenplay co-written with John Collee is excruciatingly flowery and Crowe -- chubby seedy and blond -- chugs along bending his Aussie twang into the twitterings of a ranking toff who brags without shame ""With Nelson you felt your heart glow.""From time to time a storm rolls in or the ship is attacked again leaving Aubrey to demonstrate leadership qualities by ordering extra rum rations for his men or scratching his head over whether to save a man overboard. The mechanics of shipboard life are lovingly elaborated but for an adventure tale theres little enough action unless you count copious scenes of hacksaw surgery that suggest an uncommon fondness in the director for amputation. For the rest Master and Commander takes us on a sedate world tour through ice and rain and tropical heat finishing up at the Galapagos Islands where the good doctor an amateur naturalist chases cormorants iguanas and beetles and debates creationism versus evolutionary theory with a plucky little blue-blooded apprentice (Max Pirkis). One half expects David Attenborough to drop in with some helpful info about the copulatory habits of the giant Galapagos turtle.Its clear that Weir and his extensive crew had scads of fun making their toys sail the stormy seas and Id love to be able to say that Master and Commander will fail only because it is a good old-fashioned action-adventure with no whiz-bang special effects. In truth it will fail because it is a dull and boring film pretty as a Turner landscape and as sweetly becalmed as the glassy Sargasso Sea in which the men of the unfortunately named Surprise find themselves trapped for what felt to me at least like weeks on end.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm CARNAGE A VITALLY ASSURED FIRST FEATURE by French director Delphine Gleize is a story of psychic repair without an ounce of psychology in it. The movie is about people in ordinary trouble but no ""issues"" are ""worked through"" and no oracular figure shows up to deliver the clinching insight. More literally than you might think Carnage is protein to the alfalfa of most American moviemaking about transformed lives. Far from bringing a eureka moment to the troubled souls in her roundelay ensemble Gleize sends each of them a care package containing different organs harvested from a massive bull that was slaughtered after goring a novice bullfighter. An epileptic little girl named Winnie receives an outsized bone for her familys pet a Great Dane who takes up more than his share of physical and emotional space in her parents lives. An obsessive-compulsive struggling actress played by Chiara Mastroianni sells Winnies parents the bone and in the process hooks up with a former philosopher whos trying to kill himself by skating into walls. A woman with a crippling secret of which her daughter Winnies teacher is unaware dines on a dish of toro en rioja that was meant for someone else in a restaurant. A scientist too distracted by work and adultery to notice the suspiciously large bulge in his pregnant wifes stomach receives the bulls eyes. And a mad taxidermist whos unusually close to his equally batty mother becomes the proud owner of a pair of horns with which he will convey a message to his long-lost father.The bulls name Romero means rosemary an herb held by many Spaniards to heal a multitude of ills. But deliverance -- or more precisely opportunity -- comes to these benighted sufferers not as soothing balm but as a resource. Carnage is a film about the violence of living of finding and keeping a place in the world and though its a work of preternaturally sophisticated philosophy from a director whos barely out of her 20s this beautiful bizarre movie could function quite well without its capable screenplay. Gleize brings to her blazing palette of crimson and hot pink the comedic touch of a burlesque artist and by way of Almodovar and Bunuel a brutal vision of beauty that equates with life itself. The disemboweling of the huge bull is as lovingly attended to as the little girls huge brown eyes or the livid green light of a copy machine spewing paper over a fornicating couple or a pile of white rabbits tumbling unexplained out of a decrepit trailer. Though Carnage sometimes feels overstuffed -- it suffers from the first-time filmmakers desire to pack every movie she wants to make into her first -- theres a casually impressionistic logic that links each scene or gesture to the next as the bulls power spreads through this abject crew spurring them to confront the sources of their pain or paralysis and move on though not always to greater peace. American movie violence often has a patina of naughtiness as if were getting away with something artificial and extraneous to the business of living. In Delphine Gleizes Dionysian vision violence is not just part of life but central to the struggle to slay our dragons and become more than the sum of our inherited selves.MASTER AND COMMANDER THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD Directed by PETER WEIR | Written by WEIR and JOHN COLLEE based on the ""Aubrey/Maturin"" novels by PATRICK OBRIAN | Produced by SAMUEL GOLDWYN JR.

Jack Aubrey in the rousing historical epic Master and Commander The Far Side of the World. But the concentrated force with which Crowe propels Peter Weirs masterful and commanding film has little to do with the expanse of his spiffy uniform or the thickness of the sandy-colored seamans pigtail he sports with such panache The Australian brawler would dominate the screen even if he were as skinny as a gangplank. Theres not another movie star today who maneuvers so convincingly over the map of gruff middle-aged masculine complexity a rough land triangulated between angry heroism conflicted honor and matey cheek. Crowe has a knack for making any man he plays feel vital modern authoritative and real whether in the Roman arena of ""Gladiator"" or the 1950s of ""L.A. Confidential."" I cant think of a better choice to play an officer loyal to Admiral Lord Nelson in the early 19th century during the Napoleonic Wars - or a movie star who stands a better chance of getting landlubbers (by which I mean many women and young folks or anyone who is not already devoted to the naval novels of the late Patrick OBrian) to see this bracing beautifully made saga about friendship honor courage terrible living conditions and watery adventures among men and boys. Of course I write this as a person who hasnt read more than one of OBrians 20 Aubrey novels herself. (Purists doubtless know already that the script by Weir and John Collee combines aspects of the first novel ""Master amp; Commander"" which establishes the vibrant friendship between Aubrey and his ships surgeon Stephen Maturin with bits of the 10th book ""The Far Side of the World"" in which Aubreys ship the HMS Surprise does battle with an aggressive and much more powerful enemy vessel off the coast of South America.) But Ive seen plenty of seagoing movies. And even though this one is set among men coping with ruffles and scurvy (and lads treated like miniature adults their childhoods left ashore) it gets closer to the truth of seafaring - the precision pride tedium and arduousness of it (not to mention the rot and stink) - than anything since ""Das Boot."" Even more impressive this apt and sensitive introduction to OBrians ripping maritime tales manages to make a period-piece saga feel modern - capturing something timeless in the characters of all men. ""Master and Commander"" is a story in full billow; it sails through stretches of bloody battle anxious waiting wine-soaked relaxation and marvelous scientific discoveries by the remarkable Maturin (Paul Bettany well matched again with his ""A Beautiful Mind"" costar). Officers drink and joke while down below shipmates bicker and resolve their differences. In gale winds hearty men puke. In scenes between Aubrey and Maturin as the two men make music on violin and cello Weir conveys an entire society in the creation of a duet. As Maturin studies the natural world at hand (""Your damned hobbies Sir"" Aubrey snaps during an argument) the filmmaker distills all the excitement of 19th-century scientific discovery into the study of a beetle. And when Maturin plies his surgical skills - at one point hes his own patient - the medical advances we take for granted come to look like miracles. A distractible sort could argue that the movie glides on almost too smooth a current of action and repose No scene of battle is so grand nor is any authoritative decision by Captain Aubrey so impressive that Weir holds it a gust too long. (We feel time passing only when a disembodied sailors hand overturns the ships hourglass.) Yet as he whooshes the plot along on swells of perfectly chosen music - Ralph Vaughan Williams ""Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis"" becomes the ships stirring musical anthem - the effect is properly awesome. Known for his attraction to stories about cultural dislocation (""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" ""Witness"" ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" ""The Truman Show"") and his affinity for drama in contained spaces (Amish country TV-universe bubble) Weir transforms a ship on the open sea into a neighborhood. Which brings me back to Crowe and the vigor with which the actor takes command of his fellows. ""Name a shrub after me something prickly and hard to eradicate"" the captain tells the scientist as Maturin hikes off to explore the startling wildness of the Galapagos Islands. Too bad Maturin isnt an astronomer too; a designated constellation would be the right honor for such a force as Aubrey played by such a star as Crowe.

The two films (Pirates and Master and Commander) have little in common except that both involve seafaring ships. One is pure fantasy; the other (although not based on a true story) takes rigors to be historically accurate. One is designed to please popcorn munching crowds of distracted teenagers; the other has been made for adult viewers who are interested in what it might really have been like to live on a tall ship. Master and Commander The Far Side of the World is based on the exploits of characters created by 20th Century author Patrick OBrian who wrote 20 novels centered around the adventures of Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) and Doctor Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany). Although Master and Commander uses the general plot thrust of OBrians The Far Side of the World it changes and deletes key elements and borrows select details from many of the other books in the series. The screenplay was written by Weir and John Collee who if anything may have tried to cram too much of OBrians written material into the final script. Judicious cutting could have resulted in a tremendous sea-bound adventure. When the movie opens it is August 1805 and the Napoleonic Wars are in full swing. Nowhere is the fear of Napoleon becoming Emperor of the World more prevalent than in England where the anti-French sentiment is the strongest. So in April of that year the HMS Surprise commanded by Captain Aubrey is stationed off the east coast of Brazil with the mission of stopping the French privateer Acheron. The first engagement is a near disaster for the Surprise; the French ship is bigger faster and has more guns. Only the presence of a fogbank saves Aubrey and his crew. Thereafter a chase begins with the Surprise pursuing the Acheron south through the Atlantic Ocean around Cape Horn and through the Pacific to the Galapagos Islands. The longer the chase goes on the less clear it becomes who is the pursuer and who is the pursued in this high-stakes cat-and-mouse game. Master and Commander opens and closes with rousing battle scenes. The interim 75-odd minutes include character building crew interaction and details concerning what life was like on a ship in Nelsons navy. There are a few tense moments such as when the Surprise encounters a typhoon off the coast of Cape Horn but much of the films protracted middle segment concerns more mundane matters. Some of this stuff - such as Maturin teaching a willing ""disciple"" about his naturalist hobby - is fascinating. Other elements seem pointless. At least one subplot involving an officer who is disliked by the enlisted men and wonders if he is cursed could easily have been excised resulting in a tighter storyline. The biggest problem the film has is getting its audience from one battle scene to the other without putting them to sleep. A less deliberate pace during the middle third would have made the job easier. The film looks marvelous from start to finish. In fact this may be the best-looking film ever made about a seafaring vessel. The filmmakers carefully researched ships of the era and spent time and money doing the best possible job re-creating the era. Digital effects are seamlessly incorporated so theres never a sense that whats on-screen is anything but the real thing. And the typhoon is more real than any previous at-sea storm (such as the one in The Perfect Storm). Part of the reason for this is that Weir shot footage of an actual typhoon specifically to be used during this portion of the movie. So what were seeing is not all the creation of special effects. The verisimilitude extends to the locations. The only land-based portions of the film take place on the Galapagos Islands and Master and Commander became the first movie ever to shoot there. The films emotional core is the relationship between Aubrey and Maturin. In terms of personalities they are opposites. Aubrey is a rash flamboyant warrior given to excesses of drink and courage. Maturin is far more reserved preferring intellectual pursuits and loving his pre-Darwin naturalist studies more than his duties as ships doctor. When the officers are singing a song he is always the last to join in. Despite their differences however these two are fast friends and each has a deep and abiding respect for the other. Actors Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany who previously worked together on A Beautiful Mind successfully capture the characters personalities and interaction. For Crowe this is another acting triumph - an opportunity once again to highlight his versatility. Crowes ego may make him difficult to work alongside but his performance speaks for itself. Since the entire movie is presented from the Surprises perspective the French are viewed as distant impersonal enemies. Its the right choice because it makes them more intimidating thereby increasing the tension when the two ships come into conflict. Weir wisely refrains from giving us any token point-of-view shots from the Acheron. For the entirety of Master and Commander they are simply the enemy. By restricting the majority of the action to the ship (with the exception of a few brief scenes on the Galapagos Islands) Weir is able to explore the rivalries and tensions that develop between men who are confined together in a small place under less-than-ideal circumstances. In addition to enduring the typhoon they must survive frigid weather and snow. And when the ship becomes becalmed mutinous impulses begin to rumble beneath the surface. Peter Weir is a veteran director whose films have always been characterized by their uncommon intelligence. He has been at the helm for the likes of Picnic at Hanging Rock Witness Dead Poets Society Fearless and The Truman Show. For Master and Commander Weir has been given a huge budget (rumored to be in excess of 120 million) and every cent of it appears on screen. Nevertheless for the three collaborating production companies (20th Century Fox Miramax and Universal) recovering that money will be a challenge. This is the sort of movie that could easily be lost in the pre-Oscar end-of-year hype. For those with any interest in 18th and 19th century seafaring or naval warfare this is a must-see motion picture. For others its an enlightening and entertaining experience but theres the issue of the slow middle act to overcome. The problem exists but it isnt insurmountable and thats the reason Im recommending the film.

Rare proof that a gigantic production in contemporary Hollywood can possess a distinctive personality and its own approach to storytelling ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" proves as bracing as a stiff wind on the open sea. Peter Weirs physically imposing epic fashions a world of its own as it creates a rich and vivid picture of what it must have been like to sail with the British fleet 200 years ago. Its thoroughly satisfying as an atypical adventure tale studded with unusual detailing and diverting sidelights. Adapted from two of the late Patrick OBrians series of 20 seafaring novels featuring Captain Jack Aubrey and his close friend Dr. Stephen Maturin this Fox release can expect a brawny bow on the basis of Russell Crowe toplining in an action-oriented attraction fine reviews and it cannot be denied residual interest from fans of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" a film with which this one thankfully has nothing in common other than rigging cannons and swords. But partners Fox Miramax and Universal are no doubt counting heavily on year-end awards recognition to put this serious-minded but engagingly accessible 150 million-plus venture into safe waters financially. Throughout his career Weir has displayed a great knack for delineating self-contained environments in his films from ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" and ""Gallipoli"" on through to ""Witness"" ""The Mosquito Coast"" ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""The Truman Show."" Working on by far the grandest canvas hes ever used has not diminished this talent in the slightest; in fact being confined almost exclusively to a vintage three-master might even have further focused it. Other than for two stops at the Galapagos the picture is set entirely on board the HMS Surprise a 28-gun warship and is intently devoted to portraying life above and below deck during a period of months in 1805. After concisely setting the scene with the information that Captain Aubrey (Crowe) is under orders to prevent the Acheron a significantly larger French ship from taking Napoleons war into the Pacific (how or why a solitary vessel would meaningfully do this remains an unanswered question) pic opens with a haunting prelude to a surprise attack. With the Surprise cruising along the Eastern coast of Brazil night gives way to day via wonderful images of a fog-enshrouded ship dominated by the sounds of creaking wood being buffeted about by slopping water. A junior officer on the night watch thinks he sees something peek-a-booing through the mists but isnt sure what to do. Suddenly the cottony fog clouds brighten with terrifying bursts of color and the Surprise receives a big surprise of its own as its fired upon by the Acheron. Its hull blasted into explosions of flying splinters a mast wrecked and the rudder ruined the Surprise is left drifting a sitting duck for the approaching French ship. But by quickly drawing upon his intelligence and store of naval experience dating back 20 years to youthful service under Lord Nelson Aubrey comes up with the one possible means of escape which will buy him time to repair his vessel before resuming the pursuit. Opening this way doesnt merely provide the audience with the desired action jump-start. Weir and co-scripter John Collee a Scottish physician turned novelist and dramatist use the initial skirmish to establish the central conflict assert the resourcefulness of the central character and the respect he commands from his crew and lay out the basic contours of shipboard life. (Script draws character and introductory material from OBrians first Aubrey novel ""Master and Commander"" but takes more of its narrative thrust from the 10th series entry ""The Far Side of the World."") Just as the crew of the Surprise can be pleased to be serving such an able captain so can the viewer be delighted to be in the company of such a fine character as Aubrey. Bestowed by Crowe with a physical confidence and a straightforward belief in himself Aubrey is a man who makes everyone around him feel that theyre in good hands. Unburdened by hubris or modernistic neuroses demanding but not cruel Aubrey stirs doubt among his men only by his decision to press on despite the three-week jump the Acheron now has on them rather than return home. As the Surprise sets sail once again after repairs are made and supplies taken on at a small Brazilian port (an occasion that allows for the appearance of the only woman in the cast for just a few seconds) it begins to become apparent that many screen sea-saga conventions from Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn to Burt Lancaster and Johnny Depp are to be tossed overboard There will be no evil captain no pirates no kidnapped damsel no mutiny. There is in short no melodrama just drama which rights the ship of the genre so to speak reinvigorating and refreshing it at a stroke. To chase the Acheron into the Pacific the Surprise must make the treacherous trip around Cape Horn a voyage that 40 years ago occasioned one of the screens best storm-at-sea sequences in ""Mutiny on the Bounty."" The present one unsurprisingly surpasses it putting to shame the phoniness of the digital work in ""The Perfect Storm"" via its seamless combination of full-scale tank work (accomplished at the Baja studio that was home to ""Titanic"") models and CGI. On a first viewing at least it is impossible to tell where reality leaves off and visual effects begin. In the wake of a heartbreaking loss of life during the storm Aubrey is provoked to reveal something of his absolutist side to his best friend Maturin (Paul Bettany) the Irish ships surgeon who has long accompanied Aubrey on his campaigns. Through this character appealingly underplayed by Bettany and his nicely drawn relationship with Aubrey numerous aspects of turn-of-the-19th-century life are evoked. Medical practices at the time are spotlighted with special -- sometimes grisly sometimes humorous -- attention as when a very mature 13-year-old midshipman (the immoderately good-looking Max Pirkis) must have an arm amputated or when Maturin places a coin in a mans skull to patch it up. Aubreys call to duty by the grace of God stands in contrast to Maturins compulsion to do scientific research on the Galapagos and the resultant mild conflict represents an embryonic precursor to the schism that would break open in the wake of Darwins postulations more than half-a-century later. The Aubrey-Maturin bond also provides the cue to the films singular musical approach. For recreation the two play violin-cello duets of Mozart and Bach. From there the score inventively incorporates the work of more recent composers with that of the modern Australian team of Iva Davies Richard Tognetti and Christopher Gordon which introduces significant percussive and synthesizer effects. Against the odds this combination of diverse elements coalesces and bridges the gap between authentic period sounds and contemporary excitement. With the story unfolding like chapters in a book rather than in typical movie style an initial stop at the Galapagos is cut short when the crew encounters survivors of an attack by the Acheron. Troublesome episodes follow doldrums during intense heat the flogging of an insubordinate sailor the suicide of an insecure midshipman the reckless accidental shooting of Maturin and the latter being forced to save his own life by operating on himself. A second sojourn on the Galapagos provides a more extensive opportunity to glimpse this fascinating setting (which according to Fox has never before been used in a theatrical feature film). But just when it appears that the film might be relaxing into a stretch of touristic Ramp;R a stunning apparition triggers a return to sea and the astonishing deception that enables the Surprise to live up to its name and take on the Acheron in a climactic full-blown sea battle. Weir meets all the assorted tall challenges that such a project poses meshing his sensitivity to character story theme and historical authenticity with a technical prowess that makes ""Master and Commander"" feel fully realized. Inspired by the OBrian novels which are regarded as unsurpassed in the historical fiction field for their depth of research and accuracy the films attention to detail is exceptional ever-present but never brandished for its own sake. Production designer William Sandell costume designer Wendy Stites lenser Russell Boyd and the visual effects aces are due major accolades but the credit certainly extends deeply into the huge teams responsible for the particulars of the ship stunts weapons hair speech and sound. Weir and editor Lee Smith must be especially commended for making the film breeze along at a breathless clip without ever unnaturally forcing the pace. Standing on the captains deck above it all is Crowe who looks dashing in his long blonded locks but also carries a goodly portion of the bulk that characterized Aubrey in the novels. Crowe invests the captain with authority hearty humor civilized instincts craftiness and the unmistakable sense of good fortune that backs up his characters nickname of ""Lucky Jack."" This may not be Crowes most challenging role from a psychological or emotional point of view but very few actors can so convincingly convey a man of such complete mental and physical ability. The part demands that and Crowe delivers it in a picture on which a superior director judiciously uses modern technology and the eminence hes steadily earned over a career to triumph over the constraints of conventional thinking in the narrowly defined world of modern megabuck filmmaking.
