Since the Mexico City setting is already established as a hotbed of iniquity we can expect this to be pretty chewy and so it is as Denzel launches into a virtuoso display of scumbag-wasting. Basically its a Steven Seagal flick decked out to the nines with the protagonist adopting the tooled-up Bushian approach of decimating the opposition first then asking questions. It ought to be seriously unpalatable stuff yet theres something so cherishably naff about Scotts jumping-bean cutting and hokey-cokey camerawork that its almost a guilty pleasure hitting inspired heights of ridiculousness when wailing Lisa Gerrard on the soundtrack and lingering close-ups of Denzels St Jude medallion try to convince us of some spiritual redemption. Theres steely support from distraught mum Radha Mitchell while Special Ops buddy Christopher Walken keeps a straight-ish face through lines like his art is death and hes about to paint his masterpiece. Yes its juvenile fan-boy gubbins (Tarantinos a fan) but Scotts still the daddy of sleazy Mexicano sadisto-flash trash.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

And watching these movies can be somewhat soul-deadening -- you feel as if the entire world is populated with wronged souls only waiting for an excuse to wreak their terrible revenge. For the record we might all want to be a bit more careful about not cutting people off in the parking lot these days. You never know. ""Man on Fire"" is a strange and ultraviolent misfire from director Tony Scott whos clearly turned to the dark side after his sunny 2001 CIA caper ""Spy Game."" Its really two separate movies having little to do with each other. Washington plays John Creasy a troubled man with a shadowy past (hes some sort of former assassin but we never learn much about it) who comes to Mexico to take a job as bodyguard to the 9-year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a wealthy businessman. In the films sweet but puzzlingly slow first hour Creasy and young Pita become friends. He helps her with her swimming technique she gives him a dandelion and they grin at each other while the audience checks their watches. Suddenly were jolted into an entirely different movie as Pita is kidnapped (well its hardly sudden -- Scott uses so much foreshadowing the actual event seems like a rerun) and a seriously injured Creasy is vowing to kill the parties responsible. Right there is where the movie self-destructs turning into a wildly fast-paced MTV-ish melange of lightning-quick cuts split screens slo-mo gray light and gore. Theres energy to burn sure but its out of control -- even the subtitles used for the Spanish-speaking characters suddenly take on a life of their own and start translating dialogue in English for no discernable reason. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""Man on Fire"" with Denzel Washington Dakota Fanning Christopher Walken Marc Anthony Radha Mitchell. Directed by Tony Scott from a screenplay by Brian Helgeland based on the novel by A.J. Quinnell. 146 minutes. Rated R for language and strong violence. Several theaters. And Washington at its center is lost. Early in the film this fine actor etches a portrait of Creasy as a complex tragic hero. A Bible-reading loner haunted by unknown demons he sits up late at night drinking himself into unconsciousness. In one shattering close-up relatively early in the movie alcohol has rubbed out Creasys usual watchfulness -- his face is soft his eyes hollow his expression empty despair. He and Fanning a scarily iron-jawed child actress whos as tough as any noir heroine keep their scenes interesting; an odd mismatch that somehow works because of the effort put into the performances. But after Pitas kidnapping all this goes out the window Hes become a cold-eyed Terminator sawing off peoples fingers inserting mini-bombs into body cavities and making threats like ""I will take your family apart piece by piece."" All the while he fingers the St. Jude medal Pita gave him -- but what God is guiding him here? The patron saint of the multiplexes? Scripted by Brian Helgeland (whos capable of far better -- he adapted ""Mystic River"" and ""L.A. Confidential"") ""Man on Fire"" is punishing filmmaking overlong off-putting and at times sadistic. You wonder why Washington who can put a world of meaning into the simple word ""Hi"" (listen for it late in the film) would hijack his talent to a project like this -- and what kind of revenge would be appropriate for those unfortunate enough to watch it.

(AP Photo/Stephen Vaughan) A Burned-out bodyguard (Denzel Washington) slowly warms up to the daughter of a wealthy family (Dakota Fanning)  whom he has been hired to protect in ""Man on Fire."" (AP Photo/Stephen Vaughan) Photo STEPHEN VAUGHAN REVIEW / Get out of his way -- he has people to kill 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Man on Fire Action drama. Starring Denzel Washington Christopher Walken Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. Directed by Tony Scott. (R. 146 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Man on Fire"" is a red-meat action movie whose vitality rests on the jolly sadism of its revenge story and yet for a while it maintains the illusion of something a little deeper. Denzel Washington acts as though the movie were the brooding saga of a tortured soul while screenwriter Brian Helgeland pretends to be investigating crime and corruption south of the border. Most strangely director Tony Scott presents ""Man on Fire"" as though it were an art film giving it the smeary jangled look of a nightmare one might have after a spicy meal and a Wong Kar-Wai movie. All three deserve credit for keeping a straight face but the weird thing about ""Man on Fire"" is that its best when its at its worst. The attempt at deep feeling only serves to stretch a 15-minute setup into a drawn-out hour and Scotts art-film aspirations are tedious and counterproductive. The movie doesnt catch fire until its hero does and from there its good clean carnage shootings stabbings fingers being sliced off hands being shot off and of course plastic time bombs being stuffed into bodily orifices and detonating on schedule. Only Christopher Walken seems to understand from the beginning the sort of movie hes in. As a friend of Creasy (Washington) from their days together in the CIA he gets to utter the movies choicest line. ""Creasys art is death. ... Hes about to paint his masterpiece."" But thats all third-act release. First comes the painstaking buildup. Creasy is a burnt-out former CIA assassin a man with a drinking problem and a guilty conscience. He starts the movie believing that God will never forgive him for all the terrible things hes done. He doesnt realize -- he hasnt even started yet. Determined to drift drink and eventually blow his brains out he lets his friend (Walken) talk him into a job as a bodyguard to a wealthy family. Thats how he meets Pita (Dakota Fanning) the familys perky little girl who through charm and persistence forces him to open up and become her friend. Scotts technique in ""Man on Fire"" is so scattered that a scene in which Creasy attempts to shoot himself is rendered vaguely as a series of distorted shots and jump cuts suggestive of a dream sequence. Throughout Scotts camera pyrotechnics are not psychologically appropriate stylistically interesting economical original or even pretty. Whenever the movies point of view turns omniscient and were seeing events from the directors vantage point ""Man on Fire"" becomes a blurry shaky mess. In the first 50 minutes or so we get to see Creasy looking miserable and numb and then slowly too slowly becoming almost normal. Its right around then that something bad happens something so bad that it fills him with enough righteous rage for three ""Rambo"" movies. ""Im gonna do what I do best"" he promises. ""Im gonna kill em. Everybody who was involved in it everybody who profited by it anybody who opens their eyes at me."" ""Anybody who opens their eyes at me?"" What does that mean? The line doesnt make literal sense -- even hes not angry enough to kill everybody who looks at him -- but the line sounds like Washington and thats the fun of writing for movie stars. In the midst of a bloodthirsty rant comes a line that hints at a poetic soul. Rachel Ticotin an intelligent and underused actress plays a muckraking Mexico City journalist investigating a kidnapping ring and Giancarlo Giannini plays a Mexican federal agent whos all over Ticotin like a randy young man in a Wertmuller movie. The two dress up ""Man on Fire"" just a bit but all the films propulsion comes from the heros rampage. Creasy is a tall African American in Mexico not the hardest fellow to spot and the entire police force and the mob are after him but he doesnt hide. He doesnt even walk fast. He just methodically goes about the business of creating mayhem and pithy aphorisms ""Forgiveness is between them and God. Its my job to arrange the meeting."" Obviously this is garbage but its entertaining garbage. Or to be precise its entertaining garbage with Denzel Washington in it. Weve all seen worse if not this week this month. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence and strong language.

(CNN) -- ""Man on Fire"" the new film starring Denzel Washington and directed by Tony Scott is a highly watchable action thriller with one big flaw It feels like two different movies aimed at two different audiences.The first part is all about redemption. The second is extremely violent and its all about revenge. Both parts stand up well on their own but a person who wants to see one kind of movie may not like the other.The movie based very loosely on a 1980 book by A.J. Quinnell is set in Mexico City where a wave of kidnappings by organized crime has swept the metropolis. Washington who elevates any movie in which he appears plays John Creasy a burned-out former CIA operative and assassin who is slowly killing himself with the bottle. Still when another fellow retired spook played by Christopher Walken recruits him for a bodyguard job he reluctantly accepts.Grammy winner-turned-actor Marc Anthony plays a Mexican industrialist Samuel Ramos and Australian actress Radha Mitchell plays his wife Lisa. Theyre the parents of Creasys 9-year-old charge Pita played by the always amazing Dakota Fanning. When Creasy arrives on the scene people are in a panic in Mexico City where 24 abductions have occurred in just one six-day period 70 percent of them resulting in the murder of the victim.Ramos is going through a financial crisis and cant afford regular bodyguards. So he hires Creasy at a discount because despite his impressive resume its clear that the man is a drunk. Creasy is up front about the situation He tells Ramos hell do what he can but ""you get what you pay for"" and hes no longer the best at what he does.Doing the jobIn the first part of the film Creasy is the typical world-weary cynic who wants no complications in life. He just wants to do his job and be left alone. Then slowly bit by bit hes won over by the sparkly bright-eyed optimism of his charming young charge. If youve ever seen a Shirley Temple movie youve seen this plot.However it all becomes tedious after a while because you know the little girl is going to be kidnapped you just dont know when. I was sitting in the theater screaming on the inside -- ""Kidnap her already lets move along"" Finally the deed is done. Washingtons character starts a friendship with the girl he guards played by Dakota Fanning.Now the film turns into ""Death Wish"" (1974) or ""Walking Tall"" (take your pick of versions) as revenge becomes the central character. Creasy nearly dies during the kidnapping but when he recovers he hooks up with a Mexico City newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) and a former head of Interpol (Giancarlo Giannini) who give him the inside information he needs to track down the organized gang behind the kidnappings. Basically what theyre doing is helping a vigilante who can kill at will and not have to worry about the niceties of Mexican law.Flashy camera movesThe second half of ""Man on Fire"" is completely different in its style and pace. Scott along with Paul Cameron the director of photography pull out all the stops using multiple hand-held cameras different film stocks slash edits and even a hand-cranked camera at times to slow down or speed up the movement.Its also got all the Scott touches. The director who also helmed ""Enemy of the State"" and ""The Last Boy Scout"" fills the screen with lots of blood n guts action accompanied by gigantic explosions -- all wonderfully photographed of course.The film was written by Academy Award-winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland who wrote ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Mystic River"" (though to be fair also ""The Postman"" and ""A Knights Tale"") and there is some wonderful dialogue sprinkled throughout. If youre a Denzel Washington fan -- and who isnt -- the film is worth your time and money. Just be aware youre going to be seeing two very different movies.""Man on Fire"" opens nationwide on Friday April 23 and is rated R.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

"Washington unable to bring heat to the ponderous Man on Fire - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Washington unable to bring heat to the ponderous Man on Fire By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  April 23 2004 On the heels of ""Mystic River"" ""Walking Tall"" ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" and ""The Punisher"" this weeks revenge flick is the Tony Scott rager ""Man on Fire"" with Denzel Washington as a washed-up suicidal alcoholic ex-government assassin (is there any other kind?) who takes a job as the bodyguard of Pita (Dakota Fanning) the plucky towheaded daughter of a rich family in Mexico City.The girl bonds with the drunk and suddenly the drunk doesnt mind driving her to school. The job is thankless though. Hes a glorified chauffeur and playmate. But one afternoon shes kidnapped and hes shot to death. (Or close to it.) As he lays bandaged and bleeding the girls parents (Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell) set up a ransom payment but the job gets botched. Only partially recovered from his wounds the ex-assassin -- his name is John Creasy -- stops where all those bloodthirsty avengers do at nothing. Which is also where Scott stops in turning this into a runaway Humvee of a movie.Hes shot the picture with all manner of twitches freezes and oversaturated overcranked images. Its filmed as though it has a vicious 1000-a-day crack habit -- or fleas. And were lucky if we can get a shot that lasts longer than 10 seconds. (The movie suffers from the editing-room equivalent of an irritable bowel.) Most cuts come with a nagging pounding sound which goes well with the movies lead foot and ham fist. Having over-directed ""Days of Thunder"" ""The Last Boy Scout"" ""True Romance"" ""The Fan"" and ""Enemy of the State"" with the same macho scramble Scott is the go-to guy to turn a screenplay into hot coleslaw. (The script is from Brian Helgeland who after ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Mystic River"" has become a specialist in testosterone-drizzled pulp. This latest movie is a loose remake of a 1987 Scott Glenn vehicle.)Tony Scotts new trick with ""Man on Fire"" is to bring the film as close as he can to the visual exclamations of comic books. This is a ludicrous aspiration for a movie that wants to be taken seriously. (The movie likes to lavish us with statistics about kidnappings in Latin America.) Shots are laid atop each other like paper towels over a spill. And after Pitas abduction Spanish is hurled all over the place. Subtitles wash up on the screen and they remain even when the characters are speaking English. Giancarlo Giannini shows up as a Mexican detective and Rachel Ticotin as a journalist but their English sounds fine.The subtitles are there in pedantic-moronic comic-book fashion. (""AMBUSH"") When Creasy begins his rampage his dialogue hangs in the frame the font size corresponding to his rage. He tracks down tortures and kills anyone and everyone involved with the kidnapping. In case the editing is too fast for us to see Creasys line to one of his victims -- ""Im going to cut off your fingers"" -- appears so we can follow along. In another loony moment Washington still on a mission fastens a do-rag to his head crashes a rave and yells at three employees who must know something. When he and the screen scream ""Whos the boss WHOS THE BOSS"" I thought ""Save your lives Just tell him `Tony Danzas the boss ""The movie trots out Christopher Walken as an old assassin pal of Creasys to offer shiver-me-timbers endorsements of his friend. Heres one ""He can do more justice than 10 years of your courts and tribunals just stay out of his way."" But this ones better ""Creasys art is death. Hes about to paint his masterpiece.""""Man on Fire"" is ponderous and bloated dragging the Bible and Giannini into its swirling cesspool. Scott cant give the movie any real emotional weight. And Washington gives his first lifeless performance. He leaves the melodrama and pyrotechnics to the movies technical crew. All he reveals is the paycheck smoldering in his eyes. Fanning however is a remarkably attentive child whom you really care for. But after Pitas abduction if not before the film gives up on being anything that resembles a political thriller.Toward the middle it does try sputtering into Stallone-level inanity. And there is a whiff of stupid fun in seeing Washington skulk into an elderly couples apartment to launch a shoulder-guided missile. But the movies trashy kick doesnt last long and comes too late. Still by the time its over we do understand that Denzel Washington is indeed a Man on Fire. Though I can only presume ""Hellboy"" was taken.

Yet once the 10-year-old star exits the picture Man on Fire starts blowing a lot of smoke. (Related video Watch a clip from Man on Fire) Denzel Washington is a bodyguard tasked with protecting Dakota Fanning in Man On Fire. Twentieth Century Fox To set straight every movie buff capable of esoteric heavy lifting This 2-hour 26-minute exercise in director Tony Scotts flash techniques has nothing to do with Bing Crosbys oft-televised 1957 Man on Fire but what a treat it would be seeing Der Bingle avenge sleazy stubble-faced kidnappers in todays Mexico City. It turns out this movie is a remake of Scott Glenns Italy-set Man on Fire from 1987 -- adapted from the same A.J. Quinnell novel. I saw the obscure 87 version at the time and cant recall anything about it a situation Scott seems bent on not replicating. He gives us solid chemistry between Fanning and lead Denzel Washington plus a more complex than expected characterization by Radha Mitchell as abducted Fannings mother. And he indulges in maddeningly fussy optical dissolves and sound-editing techniques that Tonys director brother Ridley Scott (Gladiator) knows to ignore. Seventeen years from now we may well remember this version of the story -- just as one remembers getting hammered on the head repeatedly with a 2-by-4. ABOUT THE MOVIE Man on Fire   1/2 (out of four) Stars Denzel Washington Dakota Fanning Christopher Walken Marc Anthony Radha Mitchell Director Tony Scott Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating R for language and strong violence Opens Friday nationwide Early on Man has its moments. Cash-strapped but livin large a Mexico City dad (Marc Anthony) gets advice from his lawyer (Mickey Rourke in a suit) to hire a bodyguard for daughter Fanning in abduction-happy Mexico City. Boozy and broken Washington gets the call cute Fanning scrapes the charred residue from his wounded heart and all goes well until indeed shes kidnapped. Christopher Walken is a gift playing the heros buddy. But from this point on the movie becomes a redundant grind. Washington gives us a primer in torture techniques on his way to getting to the bottom of what happened Fingers are severed cars do half-gainers off cliffs and without putting too fine a point on this Washington equips one malfeasant with a ticking device placed in a very vulnerable spot. Bodies pile up right until the end setting the stage for the funniest coda of its type Ive ever seen in a movie The producers wish to thank Mexico City and its people for their wonderfulness. This after 21/2 hours of portraying the burg as a cesspool of poverty daily abductions sleazy nightclubbing and corrupt police.

"Man on Fire bloody awful. Slate Sign In Sign Up Man on Fire bloody awful. Man on Fire bloody awful. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 22 2004 738 PM Make Them Die Slowly Revenge served cold in Man on Fire. By David Edelstein Vengeance is Denzels Payback dominates the box office again. Last week it was Kill Bill Vol. 2 and The Punisher; now comes Man on Fire (20th Century Fox) with Denzel Washington which makes The Punisher look like Shakespeare. As regular readers know (and will probably be sick of hearing) Im of two minds about revenge movies. As a critic I get downright moralistic about the way they make their audiences drool for the bad guys blood. Yet I keep going to them. Im in the perfect vengeance demographic Im angry at injustice enraged by my own powerlessness and frankly addicted to scenarios of injury followed by holy retribution. It worries me this punisher within who hopes the child molester will take a shiv in prison (while I oppose the death penalty) or at the other extreme wants to beat up the guy who cuts in front of me in line. Yes switching to decaf would help. But theres only so much you can do. Its a mad mad mad mad world--and this is a genre that not only caters to the madness it reinforces it. Revenge fantasies are big big business. Advertisement Its important to say that humans have always gone for tit-for-tat (or eye-for-eye) scenarios. One of our earliest and greatest epics The Odyssey closes with bloody retribution--and thats for people merely lusting after the heros wife when they thought he was dead not for actually doing anything. The 2001 Canadian film of the primal 11th-century Inuit saga The Fast Runner (Atanarjuat) ended with its hero behaving surprisingly mercifully forswearing vengeance on the tribe that tried to kill him and seize his wife. It didnt track somehow and I wasnt surprised to read that in the original the hero wasted everyone. The Jacobeans made a specialty of celebrating Machiavellian revengers who reveled in their bloodthirsty schemes. And Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson made the vigilante the true urban cowboy. But I think even they would blanch at the hero of Man on Fire. Washington plays John Creasy the alcoholic bodyguard of Pita (the blond moppet Dakota Fanning) who gets kidnapped by Mexicans held for ransom then ... well best not to give too much away. But its an amazingly opportunistic setup. The Bible-toting Creasy--a former haunted special-ops assassin who was in effect brought back to life by this wide-eyed little girl--doesnt turn the other cheek. He goes on a punishment spree thats sexed up by the director Tony Scott whos like a fat old white guy trying to be a rap-master--zooming in and out mixing film stocks superimposing shrieking victims over whip-pans of Mexico City making even the subtitles dance across the screen. The director gets in so close to his actors faces that their moles look like mountains. Scott has always been competitive with his equally vacuous but much more cinematically resourceful brother Ridley and this seems to be his stab at a Blackhawk Down-style tour de force--a nonstop barrage of MTV sound and MTV fury. But because Scott has no moral sensibility (I mean nada) this feels different than ordinary showboating. It feels like MTV rape. It was shocking in the early 60s when James Bond 007 had ""license to kill."" In Man on Fire the hero has license to torture and kill. He cuts off a mans fingers one by one. He shreds peoples ears. He extracts his info in the most grueling manner imaginable and then pulls the trigger anyway. In one scene he stuffs a time bomb up the rectum of a corrupt police official who seems to think a full confession will stop the clock on the colon-cleansing of his life. His ex-special-ops friend played by Christopher Walken tells a sympathetic inspector (Giancarlo Giannini) ""Hell deliver more justice in a weekend than 10 years of your courts and tribunals. ... Creasys art is death. Hes about to paint his masterpiece."" Rambos colonel couldnt have said it better. And then Creasy--the impassive avenging angel his long coat blurring and streaking as he strides toward a car he has just blown up to pull an injured man out and finish him off--delivers a banner vigilante line ""Forgiveness is between them and God. Its my job to arrange the meeting."" Does the movie deliver? Sure These films usually deliver even the micro-budget ones with Dolph Lundgren on Cinemax at 3 a.m. and this one is written by Brian Helgeland and tricked out with a first-rate cast. No one rises above the material though except for Walken who looks pleased with the paycheck and the top-shelf tequila. As a shady lawyer Mickey Rourke is smooth and funny but recognizable only by his familiar purr He looks like Ed Gein after cutting off someones face and pulling the skin tautly over his own. Man on Fire ends with a thank you to Mexico City ""a very special place."" As the city has just been portrayed as the most malevolent cesspool of murderous scumbags this side of Bogota thats either a nasty dig or a desperate attempt at heading off an international incident. Im not ready to swear off revenge movies yet but I find myself longing for another with the mule-kick of a Man on Fire but the double-edged even tragic perspective of The Searchers (1956) or Taxi Driver (1976) or The Limey (1999) or In the Bedroom (2001). A hopeful development is that Quentin Tarantino has announced plans to make Kill Bill Vol. 3 with a different heroine not the Bride (Uma Thurman) but Vernita Greens grown daughter who watched the Bride kill her mother at the start of Vol.1 and now wants justice of her own. Thats a great idea for a movie because it dramatizes the way that even righteous avengers set in motion blood feuds that victimize innocents and span the generations. Its payback that pays you back. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Dsepite the current mini-glut of R-rated revenge-themed pix stars status and some strong notices should generate solid mid-level biz. Denzel Washington again rewardingly explores his unsavory side in ""Man on Fire"" one of the more absorbing and palatable entries in the rather disreputable ""Death Wish""-style self-appointed vigilante sub-genre. Heavily trading on the influence of the fashionably rough style of the recent Latin American hits ""City of God"" and ""Amores Perros"" director Tony Scott and his capable screenwriter Brian Helgeland serve up a stiff triple shot of south-of-the-border java about a burned out U.S. government assassin who finds redemption in his efforts to redress the wrongs springing from a little girls kidnapping. Fox release bowing in New York and Los Angeles today in advance of wide opening Friday may prove too long and heavy to fully attract the ""Training Day"" crowd and could suffer a bit from the current mini-glut of R-rated revenge-themed pix. But stars status and some strong notices should generate solid mid-level biz with good returns down the line in ancillary markets. First 50 minutes are fully devoted to credibly forging the bond between John Creasy (Washington) a retired CIA op and self-confessed ""drunk and has-been"" and Pita Ramos (Dakota Fanning) the young daughter of Mexican industrial heir Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) and his American wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) for whom Creasy becomes bodyguard. When Creasy accepts his position which he does unenthusiastically for lack of much else to do Mexico City has been experiencing a rash of kidnappings largely spurred by criminal rather than political motives. That the Ramos family who live in old-style luxury in an ornately furnished mansion must have an armed chauffeur drive their daughter to her proper Catholic private school everyday is just a fact of life one maturely taken in stride by the highly aware Pita who reacts very quickly when a suspicious car seems to be tailing them early on. Creasy is as taciturn as Pita is lively resisting her every overture of friendship and question about his past. In fact hes hitting bottom swilling Jack Daniels and listening to Linda Ronstadts ""Blue Bayou"" before trying to commit suicide which only a defective bullet prevents. Theres plenty of opportunity here for character backgrounding but the film cuts it short suggesting only that Creasy did some nasty soul-killing things that have made him unwilling and/or unable to open up to other people. A 9-year-old who still seems to have nothing but baby teeth Pita is not only bright and well-behaved but talented at everything including playing Chopin on the piano. Shes good but not yet great at swimming and Creasy spotting her weakness is inspired to help her overcome it and win a meet. But the many omens and foreboding motifs havent been planted for nothing and in an elaborately staged and edited sequence that is deliberately confusing Pita becomes the latest statistic on Mexico Citys long crime sheet. Although pic retains the lushly appointed heavily designed look Tony Scott favors only to a slightly lesser extent than do his brother Ridley and Adrian Lyne and sometimes overdoes the atmospherics of suffering in chicness pic grafts onto this the desaturated jumpy speed-altered multi-formatted and otherwise gritty mannerisms of the most acclaimed contempo violent mellers. Hybrid style may be affected -- it even extends to the numerous subtitles which pop out from all sections of the screen and are written in small or large letters depending on the speakers tone of voice -- but nonetheless produces a powerful effect when it counts. Style comes to match setting especially in the subsequent 90 minutes of this lengthy but never dull film. After a botched ransom drop-off leaves the half the money missing one kidnapper dead and Pita presumed so the Ramoses go into muted mourning while Creasy -- whose name sounds like ""Crazy"" when said by certain characters -- becomes that stalwart of modern action films a one-man army determined to mete out justice when the system cant. He even says ""Revenge is a meal best served cold"" -- where have we heard that one before and so very recently? For Creasy this means taking on ""La Hermandad"" the mafia-like brotherhood said to protect the corrupt political and legal elite. Implacable and armed as the occasion demands the Yank enforcer who speaks quite passable Spanish uses many of the tricks of his trade to extract info from a surpassingly scummy collection of low-lifes until he learns that Pita may in fact still be alive. Creasy seems especially expert in tying and binding people so he can torture them at will and while these scenes are protracted and somewhat bloody theyre not staged so as to put the audience through the wringer. As if to emphasize the sense of a web or layers of evil Scott and his game lenser Paul Cameron make extensive use of lateral and encircling tracking shots often intercutting them to create further disorientation. Payoff long in coming feels right when it does arrive. At first seeming like a silent solitary hit man out of an old Jean-Pierre Melville film Washington commands the screen with his brooding emptiness then with his literally fired up determination to render biblical justice and achieve a measure of salvation for himself in this world or the next one. During the films first hour you never know quite what hes going to do while theres never any question about it from then on. Fanning impresses here more than ever as a precocious but never overbearing dream child. Her readings and reactions are marvelously fresh and natural without any child star ""sell"" behind her energetic enthusiasm. Mitchell nicely underplays the inevitable trauma of every mothers worst nightmare while Anthony may be deliberately opaque as the pressured father. Walken has fun with the pictures lightest role Rachel Ticotin is a crusading journalist who helps Creasy through some tricky spots Mickey Rourke is the Ramos familys supposedly adept lawyer and Giancarlo Giannini is a somewhat unlikely choice as the head of the Mexican Agency for Federal Investigation -who just happens to have worked in Rome. Production values are hefty although dominated by evocatively congested Mexico City locations. Harry Gregson-Williams suspense score is abetted by a host of source music including significant amounts of Ronstadt Nine Inch Nails and contempo Mexican sounds.

But then Man on Fire is exceedingly perplexing - a redemption film about a character who never opens up enough to earn anyones concern a child-in-peril movie that plays dirty with audience sympathies a coldly violent revenge drama that tarts up scenes of wanton sadism with lush art direction and a spiritual story that invokes serious struggle and prayer for atmosphere rather than content. Its a wicked long movie too - whole cities ought to be on fire to justify the 142-minute running time. Instead its just one mans crisis of faith and firearms were meant to support - that of John Creasy (Washington) a former covert-ops killer who in the way of remorseful company men throughout movie history is first seen deadening guilt over past misdeeds with liquor (and for character depth with a Bible). Hired as a cut-rate family bodyguard in Mexico City Creasy settles uneasily into a well-defended mansion glistening with ornate religious shrines and unexplained weird vibes Papa Samuel (Marc Anthony) is furtive and distracted mama Lisa (Radha Mitchell) is subdued and distrustful and white-blond Pita (Dakota Fanning) - from the looks of her the daughter of white-blond Lisa and the Holy Ghost - is preternaturally bright and hungry for friendship with her new petulant protector. Fanning can now add Pita to her repertoire of vulnerable and eerily serene little-girl roles; the actress self-possession is uncanny yet unmannered. And Washington can add another credit to his resume of characters built from foundations of resentment and simmering disquiet. An hour goes by before Pita is of course kidnapped during which time director Tony Scott dabbles indulgently in the kind of surface Mexican frooferoo bound to attract a filmmaker as visually glib and fussy as Scott. The remaining time is devoted to Creasys incendiary mission to blow the crap out of anyone who might have had anything to do with the crime. Is this a final showdown with God? Brian Helgelands oddly stilted script based on A.J. Quinnells novel offers no clues. The tortures and traps Creasy devises - with the help of a friendly journalist (Rachel Ticotin) an honest investigator (Giancarlo Giannini) and a fellow former soldier of fortune (Christopher Walken as always performing his own rococo one-man show in a wasted subplot) - are as elaborate as one might expect in a big-budget Tony Scott film. But the movies mortal failing is echoed in the religious medal Pita gives Creasy in a gift of innocent uplifting love Finding heft or coherence within all the lugubrious agitation is a lost cause worthy of St. Jude.
