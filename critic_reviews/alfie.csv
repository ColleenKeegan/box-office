Lewis Gilberts 1966 misogynistic rakes progress always depended on the cheek charm and chutzpah of the Kohl-eyed Caines iconic Cockney cocksman to take away the nasty taste in ones mouth. Given this New York-located remake by consumer-comedy maestro Shyer (Father of the Bride etc) is as shallow as a satin sheet and quite as sexist as the Swingin 60s version its a wonder Law took it on. Maybe he fancied the fun in an endless series of to-camera addresses of sticking two fingers up PCs fundament and laying down the law - Its all about FBB. Face boob bum - of the lively lads love em and leave em philosophy. Whatever for a movie dominated by its main character its only due to his insouciant charm that its watchable at all.The defence for the original lay in its assertion of working-class energy; a brash new class claiming its share of the cake and the bowl of cherries. Shyer casts the chain-smoking north Londoner Alfie adrift in a fashion-spread Manhattan streets initially filled like a Miss World catwalk with Benetton-coloured twentysomething beauties all double-taking as he jollies by in his farting Vespa and films him in a series of flash-plate poses as the staged waves of comeuppance wash over him. We recall the Chet Baker - Lets Get Lost - on his studio wall; resentful nightclubbers call him Eurotrash; and hes reduced to watching the happy-clappy birthday party of estranged Marisa Tomeis son through plate glass. But neither pathos nor irony take hold. No mud sticks to Jude who can be seductive funny and sweet. Omar Epps Nia Long and to a lesser extent Susan Sarandon offer good support.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

His carefully tousled blond mop? His devilish blue eyes? His oily pickup lines and false promises coated in a cool British ahccent? Please. Carrie and Co. might have a little naughty fun with this egocentric smarm machine but theyd sooner send him packing with a swift Manolo Blahnik to the backside than fall in love with the creep. Like Austin Powers with a better dental plan Alfie -- especially as played by Jude Law in the remake of the 1966 classic -- just wasnt made for these times. Jude Law in ""Alfie"" The remake of the 1966 film updates the time but not the character. (David Apple -- AP) _____More in Movies_____  Alfie Details  Watch the Trailer  Profile Jude Law  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now But that hasnt stopped writer-director Charles Shyer -- who has helmed such complex examinations of male-female relations as ""Father of the Bride"" and ""Father of the Bride II"" -- from resuscitating the heat-seeking bachelor and sending him into todays singles scene without a hint of ""Yeah baby"" irony. The new ""Alfie"" is an occasionally amusing technically lovely but ultimately dated retelling of what was once a sly chilly indictment of Swinging London during the 60s (not to mention a Best Picture nominee). Michael Caine played the lead in the original with a subtle villainous panache preying on helpless ""birds"" who had all the independence of jiggly Bond girls. He slowly developed an inner life -- a post-romp conscience if you will -- but even at the movies end when he realized he had no ""peace of mind"" and famously wondered ""Whats it all about?"" you still werent sure if he was really getting it. In the remake Shyer has jumped the pond moving Alfies wine-and-women wasteland to Manhattan. But thats just about all that has changed. With nary an acknowledgment that the past 40 years have happened -- womens lib? STDs? ""Maude""? -- the plot suspiciously remains the same Alfie seduces a married woman and a single mom he becomes an unlikely father he takes a tear-streaked someone to an abortion clinic. And his conquests despite his obviously shallow misogynistic intentions still sacrifice great chunks of their hearts to be with him. At one point a woman at a nightclub calls him ""Eurotrash"" but after Alfie flashes nothing more than a mischievous grin she melts and invites him back to her place. The movie feels like it comes from a different cinematic time -- perhaps the 80s when women were little more than hubba-hubba punch lines for the ""Porkys"" gang. Like Caines Alfie Laws promiscuous chick magnet spends much of his time smirking through the fourth wall and speaking directly to the camera -- even in the midst of saucy shenanigans in the back seat of the limo he drives for a living. He spouts such playboy wisdom as ""When it comes to shagging birds its all about location location location"" and ""It doesnt do to become dependent on anyone in life."" Caine was certainly a handsome rogue but it was his icy determined delivery during seduction that made you shudder and chuckle at once. Laws attempts at wooing are so overt and slimy you wonder how any woman could fall for him -- let alone resist smashing his gorgeous mug with a frying pan. (2002s ""About a Boy"" starring Hugh Grant did a much better job of breaking down the 21st-century male commitment-phobe.) Alfie cuddles up with a variety of beautiful dupes including a married woman (Jane Krakowski in a limo) his best friends girl (Nia Long on a pool table) a single mother (Marisa Tomei on the couch) and an emotionally unstable party girl (Laws real-life love Sienna Miller in the limo in bed in the kitchen . . . ). Most of the actresses capable talents all arent asked to do much more than look longingly at him and let out long ""Oh Alfie"" sighs even as hes breaking up with them. However Susan Sarandon who plays an older woman even more cutthroat than Alfie scores a few points for female empowerment. Their naughty May-September scenes together are the only ones that generate genuine onscreen heat. Shyer -- who cleverly uses all manner of split-screens flashbacks and rewinds to keep things moving -- often shows Alfie walking past glowing billboards reading ""Pursue"" and ""Desire"" and ""Search"" mystical advice that the protagonist is too single-minded to see. Its a neat trick but for some reason the director pretty much abandons that welcome bit of nuance in the movies clumsy final act when a repentant Alfie hit with a steady string of bad news has a sudden about-face. He cries he screams he pleads for forgiveness. Whats it all about? Overacting for one. Not to mention an unwelcome twist on the far more subtle original. Mick Jagger with help from ex-Eurythmic Dave Stewart wrote and performed several original songs for the soundtrack including ""Old Habits Die Hard"" and ""Blind Leading the Blind"" blue-eyed-soulful acknowledgments that bedroom politics have indeed changed. Jagger rock-and-rolls very own Alfie should know about these things. And Shyer should have listened to him. Alfie (103 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for sexual situations nudity and drug use.

""Alfie""? No Jude By Moira Macdonald       Seattle Times movie critic Two movie critics each bearing my name wearing my shoes and drinking my Diet Coke attended the ""Alfie"" screening. One -- let us call her M1 -- wondered how this remake of the rather dark 1966 Michael Caine film would work in a contemporary setting and how its sexual politics would translate into another era. The other -- who shall be known as M2 -- just wanted to see Jude Laws naughty grin and sea-blue eyes and to appreciate how dazzling he would look in his slim-cut retro suits and ... Ahem. Sorry. M2 took over the review for a moment. M1 now firmly back at the keyboard would like to report that ""Alfie"" the remake despite fine work by the cast (yes there are people in the movie other than Law but not sos youd notice) doesnt really work -- it ultimately has nothing to say and no reason to exist. (Some among us -- including M2 -- would say that Law gazing sideways into the camera and smiling the kind of smile that could light up a November night all by itself is reason enough. Those inclined this way should buy a ticket immediately and never mind the rest of this review. Off you go.) The 1966 original was a morality tale set in London in which chauffeur Alfie Elkins (Caine who in his golden-haired days looked just a tad like Law if you squint) bopped from bird to bird rarely occupying the same bed twice. Alfie who occasionally refers to his woman-of-the-moment as ""it"" is a heartless cad who gets his comeuppance when he has to arrange a harrowing illegal abortion. Caines bristly charm as he addressed the camera directly (a convention carried over into the remake) and the elegance of the filmmaking make the original ""Alfie"" well worth seeing even as its darkness overwhelms Caines sun. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""Alfie"" with Jude Law Marisa Tomei Omar Epps Nia Long Jane Krakowski Sienna Miller Susan Sarandon. Directed by Charles Shyer from a screenplay by Elaine Pope and Shyer based on the film and play by Bill Naughton. 103 minutes. Rated R for sexual content some language and drug use. Several theaters. For the remake director Charles Shyer and co-writer Elaine Pope tossed out most of the controversial content softening Alfie into a lovable rogue and lighting Law like hes a work of art. (Which he is says M2 for the record.) The resulting movie is airy entertainment; showing off its leading man and its snazzy production design ultimately going nowhere. Law his hair standing up like a roosters comb is marvelously relaxed cruising around Manhattan in his turquoise scooter like its a magic carpet. But his considerable acting chops never come into play; this is all hair costumes and teeth dazzlingly employed. And ... well lets just say that M1 left the theater dissatisfied while M2 mentally speeding off into the sunset on the back of that scooter was smiling. M1 gives ""Alfie"" 2-1/2 stars. M2s rating? Oh 5 or 6 at least. Sigh. Back to work now.

(AP Photo/Paramount ... more Photo DAVID APPLEBY Alfie remake knows what its all about 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Alfie Comedy-drama. Starring Jude Law Marisa Tomei and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Charles Shyer. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Alfie"" is a remake of the 1966 British film that made an international star of Michael Caine . It takes a story very much associated with a particular time and place -- London in the swinging 60s -- and successfully transplants it to modern-day New York City. The cockney lothario played by Caine has been turned into a working-class British emigre played by Jude Law who makes Alfie a bit less cockney and a bit more self-aware. The differences between the two movies are fascinating and worth lingering over but the first thing that needs to be said is that screenwriters Elaine Pope and Charles Shyer have done a notably creative and intelligent job of adapting the old material. The new script raises the emotional stakes of the old scenes it retains cuts plot elements that cant be updated and creates new story lines that are just as effective as those it replaces. In directing the film Shyer grounds it in contemporary concerns while adding just a hint of 60s atmosphere (in the womens hairstyles especially) just for zest. The result is a smart heartfelt film that holds up on its own terms. Like the earlier ""Alfie"" its the story of a sexually promiscuous man. Alfie (Law) a chauffeur lives in a small Manhattan apartment and dedicates his life to seducing women. Talking directly into the camera and preening with a self-satisfaction so complete as to seem a form of innocence he expounds on clothes the proper application of cologne and the various rules he employs in his libidinous pursuits. His goal it seems is to have sex with as many women as possible but to get close to none of them. This takes coldness and discipline. At the same time in order to have some of the advantages of a stable relationship -- hot meals comfort and someone who cares if he lives or dies -- he maintains a quasi-girlfriend in Julie (Marisa Tomei) a long-suffering single mom. Watching their interaction its obvious that hes using his charm to steamroll her. At the same time we see what she sees the glint of some fundamental decency in this guy that gives her a bit of hope. Like the earlier ""Alfie"" the new version could be called a cautionary tale about a way of life that leads to the existential confusion embodied in the famous catchphrase ""Whats it all about?"" But different eras make for subtle differences in presentation. The original ""Alfie"" couldnt help but capture a certain exuberance in the air -- it was made at the dawn of the sexual revolution. But the new ""Alfie"" is post-sexual revolution and theres no mistaking the difference. This film presents its hero less as a type than as a specific guy making specific mistakes. It takes us deeper into Alfies pain and is not impressed with his way of life. Only barely could this ""Alfie"" be considered a comedy. A major part of what makes ""Alfie"" emotionally effective is that the director invests in developing the female characters and the actresses who play these women dont shortchange their essential dignity. Nia Long brings fire to her role as the girlfriend of Alfies best pal (Omar Epps). Theres a lovely ruefulness underscoring Marisa Tomeis performance as Alfies almost girlfriend. And newcomer Sienna Miller is a real find as a young woman who bursts into Alfies life all excitement and glamour followed by neurosis and substance abuse. Alfie may think its just a mans world but we can see that its not. Susan Sarandon plays the older woman in Alfies life a role played in the 1966 film by Shelley Winters and the casting difference underscores the remakes difference in tone. The original film invited us to witness their mutual seduction from a distance as something vaguely absurd but theres nothing absurd about Sarandons allure. Unlike the other women in ""Alfie"" shes at least as dangerous as he is and shes been around. An Alfie whod be attracted to these women is a different kind of Alfie and so Law taking on a part associated with another actor is able to make the role his own. Where Caine was like an arsonist in his relationships Laws Alfie is more like a kid playing with matches -- innocent and genuinely surprised when things start blowing up around him. Law makes Alfies befuddlement a surprisingly poignant thing to witness. -- Advisory Sexual situations adult situations nudity drug use strong language.

"In updated Alfie its all about vanity - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In updated Alfie its all about vanity By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  November 5 2004 This weeks Jude Law movie is Alfie."" For those of you keeping score thats three down and three to go before the holidays although its a steep task to consider Alfie"" anything other than a Vanity Fair pictorial. And thats not because the man who runs the magazine has been given a part in the movie as an adulterous gasbag either.Alfie"" manages to be a ditsy portrait of a happy-go-lucky bachelor. The movie has only flattering things to say and is driven by images of Law looking never less than scrumptious. Hes not the only fabulous one. The closing credits come with still black-and-white photographs of the cast and crew having an annoyingly good time.We see Alfie score with such beauties as Jane Krakowski and Marisa Tomei Nia Long and Susan Sarandon. No one can resist him. Under Charles Shyers direction everything in Alfie"" glows -- often radioactively at least where Shyers story or his dialogue is concerned. The cinematography (by Ashley Rowe) makes some things like Nia Longs brown skin look like blue velvet and others look as if youre seeing them through a champagne flute.This is a remake of the judgmental 1966 romp with Michael Caine as a bird""-chasing dog. Shyers version is a thing of infinite emptiness and nauseating vanity. Its not funny alluring affecting or erotic just conceited.Laws Alfie is an upwardly mobile Manhattan chauffeur who wants to start his own limo company with his best friend Marlon played by Omar Epps a handsome man whos never allowed to be as blithe or sartorially inspired as his costar. Alfie rides around the city on his Vespa and turns to the camera to explain to us what hes doing how hes feeling and whom hell chase next.Not even a bout of erectile dysfunction can soothe his addiction to women. When the unsinkably horny Alfie finds out hes not going to die of a venereal disease (a miracle frankly) he pulls a Gene Kelly and spins around on a pole stomps in a puddle and dances up the street. The revelation that one of his conquests plans to have an abortion dampens his elation -- or so youd think. Sure he mopes around Manhattan for a scene or two but it wont be long until hes sniffing around the heels of a fresh conquest. I like Jude Law but in all my memories of this movie Alfie is played by Pepe Le Pew.He loves up a married woman (Krakowski) a single mom (Tomei) his best friends girl (Long) a party monster (Sienna Miller) and a decadent cosmetics empress (Sarandon). Theyre not women theyre subway stops. And the film is decapitated from reality. It alleges to traffic in such real-world experiences as loneliness lust and backstabbing but it treats them as though they were ingredients for a martini. Who needs this when there are further dispatches from Bridget Joness diary coming?Alfie is the fellow some American men once longed to be seductive well-groomed English-accented. And Shyers movie is just a miscued celebration of bachelor pomp. Its other stabs at hipness are dreadful Mick Jagger and Eurythmic Dave Stewart wrote the mewling soundtrack and English soul-thang Joss Stone manhandles the theme song.Further attempts to be progressive are backhanded and embarrassing too. Law and Long have sex on a pool table while the Isley Brothers play in the background. (Its a groovy 007-ish moment.) But later when one of Alfies neighbors sees Long on his stoop she congratulates him saying How nice of you to date an African-American""Shyer tries his hand at the grown-up hassles in the original but its hard to take the movies preening seriously. This Alfies greatest concerns amount to which Paul Smith jacket to wear with which Prada loafers. This is the first movie to address the needs of straight men who love women but love their hair even more. The tagline asks Whats it all about?"" The answer is easy Metrosexuals.What this remake is missing -- well the most crucial thing -- is the pain of the original. Caines skirt-chaser was wounded by the end. He was needy and pathologically afraid of solitude and being disliked. Shyer doesnt afford Law the same vulnerable insecurities. The camera was a window for Caine; with Law its a mirror.Teamed with his ex-wife Nancy Meyers Shyer cranked out a string of shallow gender comedies -- Baby Boom"" and the Father of the Bride"" remakes -- that were hits in the 80s and early 90s. A few years ago he and Meyers split up. She went on to make wrongheaded market-driven pablum like What Women Want"" and Somethings Gotta Give."" Alfie"" confirms that in the divorce they got joint custody of foolishness. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Then rent a DVD version of the 1966 British original starring Michael Caine. No bleedin contest mate. Michaels got the Caine-do attitude. Jude ought to go into law. In the original ""Alfie"" Caine is Alfie a Londoner who loves his women or ""birds."" Hes a roguish charmer from the moment he emerges from a window-fogged car. Hes just had a naughty little maneuver in there with a married woman. He dusts off his coat and addresses the camera matter of factly about his swinging life. An ironic narrator he speaks with purposely inappropriate breeziness about the women whose hearts he breaks so effortlessly. But despite his cavalier ways theres something almost childlike and sweet about this Alfie. You warm up to this rascal right away because you know hes got a heart; hes just in denial about it. Caines bravura often hilarious performance is fortified by a brilliant script which Bill Naughton adapted from his play. This brings us to the newest ""Alfie"" directed by Charles Shyer which changes the London locale to New York City. Right there were in trouble already. But lets move on. Shyer a co-writer of ""Private Benjamin"" with a seeming penchant for redoing older better films (""Father of the Bride"" and ""The Parent Trap"") and TV sitcom writer Elaine Pope have reconfigured their Alfie for the modern day. A Brit from modest digs in London he moves to New York City and becomes a sort of eurotrashy poseur living in a low-rent corner of the Big Apple dressing in retro 60s chic. And just to show theres still a little Englishman left in him he also calls his female quarry birds. (You dont believe his act or his language for a minute.) He seems to be one part Alfie from the 1960s and the other part well multiplex star drone. Theres nothing authentic about this London lad. (Even songs written for the movie by famous musical Brits Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart sound bland and counterfeit.) Nothing particularly likable either. In fact hes the equivalent of the dead parrot in the famous Monty Python sketch. He only looks alive because hes all but nailed to his perch. Sure hes good-looking and can expect shivery response from certain members of the audience but Alfie e aint. Laws Alfie is using dependable girl Julie (Marisa Tomei) as his back-up girlfriend. And his big moral issue is when he finds himself in a compromising position with sultry Lonette (Nia Long) whos still involved with Alfies good friend Marlon (Omar Epps). Alfie goes for the moment and ends up sorry. At first he thinks hes accidentally done some good because Lonette immediately reunites with Marlon. But as Alfie points out in his voice-over no good deed goes unpunished. In fairness to Shyer and Pope they had to retrofit their women. In the 1960s women on screen werent given much in the way of independence. The female characters in the 1966 ""Alfie"" are pushovers easy to abuse and boss around. In this day and age as Alfie would say ladies have become women. Theyve evolved into equal contenders in the romantic power game. And pulling a fast one over them is not only impossible its morally unacceptable for the audience. But these updated zesty women -- including Laws current squeeze Sienna Miller as Nikki a blond beauty with dark issues -- feel forced into the story. Their relationships with Alfie are uninvolving and trite. The three-way relationship among Alfie Marlon and Lonette is particularly contrived. There seems to be no reason any of them would be remotely interested in one another as friends or lovers. Theyre thrown together just to look cosmopolitan and you know New York-like. The best character tussle comes toward the end when Alfie meets his match the very interesting Liz (Susan Sarandon) an uptown older woman whos decked out in Chanel and knows what she wants out of men. Sarandon puts major voluptuous oomph into the part almost jolting Law out of his pretty-boy complacency. (Dont miss Shelley Winterss sassy turn in the same role in the original.) But unfortunately this provocative battle comes too late. Weve long stopped caring about the question from the famous pop song Whats it all about Alfie?

The question likely to be posed to the Jude Law remake is ""Why are you here?"" Sienna Miller Jude Laws real-life girlfriend plays one of his many onscreen loves in this Alfie remake. Paramount Pictures The Oscar-nominated original made Michael Caine a star and earned him a nomination after he had made a strong impression in 1965s The Ipcress File. Though its a credit to Caines charm that you can still wince your way through the original Alfie theres a reason it can now be viewed only as a strongly performed period piece. (Related video See a preview of Alfie) Caines cockney character doesnt shy from displaying outright contempt for women; by talking directly to the audience he tries to turn us into co-conspirators in a heh-heh way. Back then his mind-set was half in keeping with the times but today that Alfie probably would be strung upside down as a wall decoration at a National Organization for Women party. About the movie Alfie   1/2 (out of four) Stars Jude Law Marisa Tomei Nia Long Omar Epps Nia Long Jane Krakowski Sienna Miller Susan Sarandon Directors Charles Shyer Distributor Paramount Rated R for sexual content some language and drug use Opens Friday nationwide Laws charm is as bountiful as Caines so theres no question that director/co-adapter Charles Shyer has chosen the right Alfie for a remake. Laws into-the-camera speechifying seems more self-conscious than his predecessors but thats because the device seems less fresh after 38 years. And Laws Alfie (now a Manhattan chauffeur) hop-skips his way through several attractive women who seem less ground-down than those in the original. Theyre played by Marisa Tomei Nia Long Jane Krakowski Sienna Miller and Susan Sarandon. Sarandon has enough years on her to have been in the original though shes apparently never going to show them. Though hes highly irresponsible this Alfie is not quite a calculating heel which makes the material go down easier while blunting the point. Theres no equivalent to the originals grisly abortion scene which made an entire generation of young moviegoers vow to be very careful and Caines performance aside gave the film its reputation. In this version certain characters take emotional hits but the power of the stronger scenes is fleeting. Yet Alfies defense comes purely on an escapist level It has pretty people in color-drenched Manhattan when a major multiplex alternative is the horror flick Saw. So instead of Cary Elwes chained in a grimy warehouse urinal pondering whether to cut off his foot or die you have Jude Law and comparable female lookers against vistas that make New York look like the city Mel Torme sang about. In election week thats a winning ballot-box alternative if ever there was one.

As the cad of a seducer in Alfie (1966) Michael Caine became a star by bringing that contempt out into the open. Speaking with mock-confessional honesty directly to the audience he was prickly and funny but in a cackling English way that withered into heartlessness. (He referred to more than one conquest as ""it."") The film was breezy and devious but with a lonely chill beneath its surface. Theres nothing chilly about Jude Law or about the new lite spangly-colored Alfie. Our titular lady-killer is still British but hes been transplanted to New York City where hes a limo driver who has his pick of an endless merry-go-round of babes. Early on theres a fanfare of Alfie riding on a Vespa and Law with his elfin grin and just-unkempt-enough-to-be-adorable copper hair is served up as such a tasty treat of a man that every leggy beauty on the street casts a longing look his way. Is the director Charles Shyer tweaking Alfies narcissism or is his style so glib and glancing that Alfie is truly meant to be the most desirable bachelor in Manhattan? It works out as the latter and thats a bit of a shame. The new Alfie is so irresistible that he hardly requires contempt. Without it the movie is little more than a feature-length roll in the hay. Given our more relaxed sexual era Alfie scarcely needed to be as thorough a bastard as he was in the mid-60s. But couldnt we at least have seen him plying his seductive art? His erotic clout is treated as automatic and with Law turning to the camera every three minutes to address the audience the movie never quite settles into a present tense. It leapfrogs like Alfie from one pleasantly meaningless encounter to the next. Theres Jane Krakowski as the married stunner he beds in his limo Marisa Tomei as the single mom he treats as a booty-call doormat Nia Long as the girlfriend of his best friend (Omar Epps) -- the sultry scene between Law and Long in an empty bar is the closest the film comes to a piquant moment -- and Susan Sarandon as the cosmetics mogul who proves that fiftysomething is the new hot. The actresses are likable but the film tosses them away as casually as Alfie does. Strangely the one woman he tries to settle down with (Sienna Miller) is gorgeous in such a model-anonymous way that were not sure given Alfies proclivities why he bothers spending more than a weekend with her. Jude Law would appear to have all the attributes of a movie star looks humor rogue charm. Yet theres one he could use more of -- an anger that might ignite his smooth presence. Law makes self-satisfaction beguiling and in an odd way thats his and the movies limitation. We never feel in our bones that Alfie needs to change.

Jude Law shines as the English pretty-boy cutting a wide swath through the women of Manhattan and while the films verve and alluring cast look to ignite some nice B.O. sparks in late-fall release softening of the originals harsh bite results in a work of only modest heft. Pushed back to a Nov. 5 bow Stateside pic opens today (Oct. 22) in the U.K. As performed by Caine and before him John Neville and Terence Stamp onstage playwright Bill Naughtons Alfie was a Cockney cad who had his way with an array of women. The femmes were not all knockouts but most of them were compliantly willing to be used and then tossed out as the Rolling Stones put it at the time like yesterdays papers. Seeing the film today is among other things an instructive reminder of the pre-feminist mindset at least among a certain class of women. Director Charles Shyer and his co-scenarist Elaine Pope a comedy writer and producer on ""Murphy Brown"" and ""Seinfeld"" have recalibrated the material in mostly plausible ways for modern sensibilities. Alfie has been kicked up the social scale at least a couple of notches with a softened accent greatly augmented fashion sense and awareness of female issues all contributing to create a revised character considered Eurotrash by some but whose looks charm and energy make him welcome everywhere he goes. The move to New York City motivated by Alfies impression that the city has ""the most beautiful birds in the world"" also feels right -- it further dispenses with class distinctions and creates a fresh backdrop for the story. And the fact that the women have minds of their own and dont necessarily take Alfies act lying down so to speak serves to challenge the mans complacent cockiness which is once again engagingly expressed in confidential running commentary addressed straight to camera. ""It doesnt do to become dependent on anybody in this life"" Alfie advises at the outset when hes splitting his time between a married woman (Jane Krakowski) and his ""semi-regular quasi-sort of girlfriend"" Julie (Marisa Tomei) the single mom of a boy of whom Alfies quite fond. Julie would clearly like to settle down but this is the surest thing to drive Alfie away; as reconceived and watered down here Alfie is not a heartless rake but merely suffers from ""commitment issues."" His scant moral sense is also evident in how he treats his best mate Marlon (Omar Epps) a fellow limo driver distraught over being dumped by foxy barmaid Lonette (Nia Long). So what does Alfie do? He gets wasted with Lonette afterhours and gets it on with her on the bars pool table. Lonette ends up back with Marlon but its Alfie who accompanies her to an abortion clinic shortly thereafter. This close call coincides with a stretch of ""erectile dysfunction"" for the swinging bachelor which occasions what could be the first extended interlude in cinema history dedicated to illustrating the heros inability to get it up with a succession of women. Episode ends oddly with Alfie becoming aroused when a queenly doctor examines his ailing organ. Fully back in business with winter approaching Alfie soon finds his Christmas stocking overflowing with two dynamite new ladies. Deciding post-ailment that he can ""aim higher"" the lad is welcomed into the life of glamorous cosmetics tycoon Liz (Susan Sarandon) whose ripe worldly woman triggers an instant enthusiasm in Alfie for older femmes. Then theres hot-to-trot Nikki (Sienna Miller) a smashingly sexy party girl who seems at first to be Alfies perfect match. Even Alfie thinks so making a huge exception to his rules by letting her lodge at his apartment. But unlike Alfie Nikki doesnt know how to curb her excesses careening too far out of control for her ardent lover to tolerate it. As they did before the chickens come home to roost for Alfie in the final act although in less convulsive ways. Liz lowers the boom on him the same way Shelley Winters did to her gigolo the first time around and Alfies one-night stand with Lonette comes back to haunt him in a manner he never dreamed possible. But Shyer and Pope dont even try to find a contempo equivalent to the originals climactic story strand involving the illicit abortion of an older married woman Alfie impregnated and his devastated reaction to the home procedure. Lacking anything like this new version comes up significantly short in final impact. The challenge of taking on esteemed material has evidently inspired director Shyer to shake off the bland and bloodless polish of his ultra-mainstream Hollywood pictures to inject this remake with welcome vitality. Happily dropping the affected use of single thematic words art-directed into the backgrounds of scenes Shyer employs a jumpy quick-cutting style hes never used before. He also relies to a great degree on rich musical ingredients including wafts of the great original tune by Burt Bacharach and Hal David (does anyone remember that it was Cher not Dionne Warwick who sang it under the end credits of the original film?) several arresting new contributions from Mick Jagger Dave Stewart and John Powell and numerous standards. But he also gets the dynamics among the characters right is generous to his actors (all the actresses come off very nicely indeed thanks also to Ashley Rowes consistently becoming lighting and lensing) and guides Law to an entirely engaging performance that does not so much compete with Caines as comfortably co-exist alongside it at a nearly four-decade remove. Many men meeting an Alfie in real life would no doubt be put off by his impossibly good looks and luck with women but Law makes him entirely palatable company.
