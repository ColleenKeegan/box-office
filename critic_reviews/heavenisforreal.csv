Daily Edition Login to download Heaven Is For Real Film Review 615 PM PDT 4/15/2014 by Stephen Farber FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A boys journey to heaven will entice Christian audiences without driving other viewers up the wall. TWITTER Greg Kinnear stars in the adaptation of the Christian book. Christian moviegoers already turned Gods Not Dead into a surprise hit this year and even more should flock to Heaven Is For Real a movie made on a bigger budget and drawn from a best-selling book about a young boys near-death experiences of the afterlife. This picture from Braveheart screenwriter and Secretariat director Randall Wallace is unlikely to convert any skeptics but if they wander into the multiplex theyll find that that the prettily photographed sermon goes down easily. The low-pressure approach of the filmmakers is very much the same tactic taken by small-town pastor Todd Burpo (Greg Kinnear) in his orations to his congregation. He dresses casually and addresses his flock without any hectoring or fire-and-brimstone declaiming. (The ethnic diversity of the small Midwestern congregation however seems more politically correct than geographically credible.)  But when Todds four-year-old son Colton (Connor Corum) is rushed to the hospital with a ruptured appendix the familys world threatens to collapse. Colton survives emergency surgery but he returns to the land of the living with tales of the visions of heaven he experienced including an encounter with Jesus himself. Todd is initially skeptical but when Colton recounts details about dead family members whom he never knew Todd begins to accept the boys visions. Yet other inhabitants of the town as well as members of the church executive board are more skeptical fearing that the boys tales from the other side are turning their congregation into something of a circus sideshow. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies Thats about the extent of the drama in this rather attenuated film.  True believers will find the films evocations of heaven quite enough to sustain their interest but other viewers -- even those who might be curious about the films thesis -- will search in vain for a more compelling narrative. Margo Martindale plays one of the church leaders who is concerned about the notoriety the boys tales attract but this story strand isnt well-developed and is resolved far too easily. The overwrought melodrama that marred Gods Not Dead is luckily absent but Heaven desperately needs a greater sense of urgency. Some of this is provided by Todds financial hardships which add intriguing and unexpected dimension to the life of a contemporary country pastor. Todd cant make a living as a preacher so he works in construction and also as a volunteer fireman. A scene in which he has to tell a hospital administrator that he cant afford to pay his whopping medical bill gives an unexpectedly sharp edge to the movie. The grittier realities of life in small-town America are obviously not what this film wants to highlight yet those glimpses add some valued texture to the film. The images of heaven are too antiseptic to prove very persuasive to nonbelievers but the film does achieve moments of spiritual grandeur in its more realistic scenes. Oscar-winning cinematographer Dean Semler (Dances With Wolves) brings a breathtaking sense of widescreen wonder to the Nebraska prairie vistas (actually shot in Canada) and these images convey a more subtle sense of transcendent possibilities than the heavenly interludes with gossamer angels. PHOTOS 13 Devilishly Handsome Actors Whove Played Jesus Working with Semler Wallace achieves some visual epiphanies and he also draws effectively natural performances from the actors. Kinnear is always believably human and as his wife British actress Kelly Reilly (who made a strong impression as Denzel Washingtons love interest in Flight) has an appealing earthiness. Martindale has a couple of moving moments though Oscar nominee Thomas Haden Church has a disappointingly thin role as the town banker. One of the reasons the film works as well as it does is because of the casting of Corum as young Colton. Unlike many child actors his age Corum never milks the audience. He is appealingly understated which shows the tact of director Wallace. But aside from any acting ability his angelic face cannot help but strengthen the movies thesis. Wallace made a lot of shrewd decisions to sock this movie home but he cant entirely overcome the dramatic thinness of the original material. The faithful may well be weeping by the films conclusion while others will remain more detached feeling little except gratitude that they havent been bludgeoned into believing.

He could be Jewish but were talking Jewish in a prep-school drug-dealer vein more than the first-century Palestinian periphery of the Roman Empire. But let me stop you right there before we slide further down the well-worn path to easy ridicule. This movie is bizarre conflicted unintentionally hilarious and profoundly mediocre - something like one of those based-on-a-true-story demonic possession yarns with its polarities reversed - but not stupid in the way youre probably thinking. Even its depiction of a blue-eyed bathrobe-wearing Savior comes with a surprising degree of psychological uncertainty or even epistemological hedge. This is a big-tent Christian film that wriggles around a lot seeking to accommodate multiple varieties of religious experience and ends up terminally infected with the virus of postmodern relativism. Is heaven indeed for real? Um sure. Maybe As a purportedly devout public figure put it some years ago it depends what the meaning of ""is"" is.In the first scene of ""Heaven Is for Real"" Greg Kinnear states the problem in voice-over Is heaven ""just a hope"" or a place as real as the earth where we live out our pre-heavenly lives? This is clearly meant to recall the words of the Church of Englands 1559 Book of Common Prayer quoted or paraphrased to this day by almost every Protestant minister who commits a dead person to the earth while invoking ""the sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ."" I sat in a freezing country churchyard a few weeks ago and listened to a Southern Baptist preacher several degrees of dissent removed from Anglican orthodoxy say those very words. (While the Roman Catholic Church of my own forefathers does not use that language the sentiment invoked is much the same.)But what those words mean to believers is by no means clear obvious or uniform. How do Christians make sense of the conflicted phrase ""sure and certain hope"" and how literally do they take the notions of bodily resurrection and eternal life? Todd Burpo the real-life Nebraska clergyman who wrote the pop-religion bestseller ""Heaven Is for Real"" and is played by Kinnear in the movie may not exactly be Thomas Aquinas but he clearly understands that centuries of theological turmoil ride along with these questions. The only correct answer is that there is no one correct answer a fact that many of the Manichaean and simplistic debates about the role of religion in American society overlook or ignore.Some contemporary atheists (although certainly not all) seek to boil down religious belief to a capricious narrative of salvation and damnation in which I will live forever at the right hand of the Lord while you burn in a lake of fire. That strain of faith certainly plays a charismatic role in American religious discourse but very few people live their lives as if they were fully convinced by it. Even the success of ""Heaven Is for Real"" a work that despite its declarative title strives to encompass every degree of belief and agnosticism testifies to a hunger for conviction in a landscape of doubt. Some people who call themselves Christians possess an atheistic optimism about some mystical future communion with the universe while others have a highly specific vision of the afterlife that involves physical reunion with great-aunts and pet hamsters. Just as fundamentalist Christians who claim to see the Bible as inerrant divine truth actually pick and choose which verses to focus on and which to ignore I suspect that people who say they believe in a literal heaven have extremely different ideas about what that actually means.In director Randall Wallaces adaptation of the Burpo familys saga (he co-wrote the screenplay with Chris Parker) the tale of 4-year-old Colton Burpos visit to heaven plays out almost like a shaggy-dog story or one of Sherlock Holmes adventures deconstructing itself as it goes along. ""Heaven Is for Real"" is almost disconcertingly eager to supply possible rational-world explanations for Coltons visions of Jesus on horseback a choir of angels and a stillborn sister he never knew about. (She has grown to the age of 6 or so and donned a prim pink dress but who can say how these things work?) Colton is a bright and suggestible child from a deeply religious family who returns from a grave illness and emergency surgery - but not really a ""near-death experience"" in the usual sense - with a mixture of imbibed spiritual imagery details gathered from his domestic life and pure imagination. When Todd spins the tale for a university psychologist she politely shoos him away Kids observe a lot more than we think and they make up stories meant to satisfy adult needs. End of story.""Heaven Is for Real"" has exactly the same structure as one of those family horror movies about a weird kid who is possessed by diabolical forces and gradually reveals depths of disturbing secret knowledge. Only here the cheerful music sunny cinematography and people who smile all the time are meant to convince us the supernatural events are not sinister. (In fairness when sad things happen the people in the movie look sad albeit briefly.) Wallace who directed the crypto-right-wing ""Secretariat"" and wrote the Oscar-nominated screenplay for ""Braveheart"" is an interesting case as one of the few Hollywood insiders whos also a Christian conservative. I wish he were a more interesting filmmaker. The cast of ""Heaven Is for Real"" has apparently been instructed to beam their emotions at us and each other in halogen-headlight style with no hint of ambiguity or inner conflict. Every minor witticism is received with joy; every conversation at the diner or the bank is imbued with the inexpressible love of God and humanity. That gets old really fast and after half an hour I hungered to find wherever the Coors-drinking degenerates and meth-cooking rednecks were hiding in this idyllic softball-playing prairie wasteland. You Might Also Like Of course we never encounter any signs of social disorder or dysfunction in the Burpos achingly wholesome community with its one achingly wholesome black family (consigned to the background) and its even more achingly wholesome Latino family. This portrayal of the mythological heartland aimed at moviegoers in suburban multiplexes surrounded by strangled traffic and acres of parking lots feels more desperate than reassuring Not only is there life after death there is also an earthly paradise out in some pancake-flat red state youll never visit where neighbors help neighbors women sing hymns on Sunday and nobody gets their house repossessed or sits around for 16 hours smoking weed and playing World of Warcraft. The pace of change in Imperial Neb. has been modulated it appears by the intensely boring basic goodness of America. The Burpo kids know ""We Will Rock You"" but not Snoop Dogg; adult viewers will pick up on the faint suggestion that Todd and his wife Sonja (Kelly Reilly) may go a bit beyond vanilla behind closed doors. But the world of ""Heaven Is for Real"" is nostalgia for nostalgia like an attempt to recapture the magic of Ronald Reagans ""Morning in America"" commercial which itself promised a return to something that never existed.All the anxiety and disorder that is suppressed at the surface of ""Heaven Is for Real"" bubbles up in Todd Burpos Job-like or Christ-like spiritual struggle as he tries to figure out how to make sense personally and theologically of his sons incoherent visitation with blue-eyed Jesus. Its worth noting that the real Todd Burpo is a minister in the Wesleyan Church an evangelical or ""holiness"" offshoot of Methodism that does not fit easily into narratives about liberal vs. conservative Christianity. While Wesleyans assert ""Biblical infallibility"" they dont mean the same thing by that phrase as most modern-day fundamentalists do. Wesleyans were abolitionists and supporters of womens rights in the 19th century; the legendary Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 was hosted by a Wesleyan chapel. Theyre a Trinitarian anti-Calvinist denomination whose doctrines are big on free will and moral responsibility not young-earthers or born-agains or gay-haters. In theological terms the Wesleyans are ""post-millennial"" meaning that the focus is on the idea that Christ already came once and offered us salvation rather than on the ""pre-millennial"" obsessions of many other evangelicals The Second Coming the Rapture the Number of the Beast and so on. By flirting with the idea that his toddler son had a ""real"" vision of heaven and then by finessing the question of what that means Burpo ventures pretty far from Wesleyan doctrinal caution. Hes trying to inject a little pre-millennial or pseudo-fundamentalist fervor into the desiccated terrain of post-millennial Protestant theology which has been overwhelmed by the Bible-thumpers on one hand and by the secular forces of late capitalism on the other. On the right wing he tries to open the tent to true believers Hey a girl in Lithuania met the same blue-eyed Jesus and its on YouTube. Heaven -- total science On the left he beckons to bewildered Information Age agnostics Well it was real to Colton and who am I to say? How do we even know what ""real"" is anyway? Maybe its a metaphor about how we should live our lives on earth and stuffIn Kinnears compassionate performance Burpos attempt to extract profound truths from a little kids dreams or hallucinations is pathetic and almost endearing and thoroughly undermines itself with all its nervous switchbacks and asterisks and parentheses. American liberals love nothing better than to thrill at the blend of theocratic nightmare and idiotic superstition that prevails in flyover country but I can find no basis for skin-crawling terror or smug superiority in ""Heaven Is for Real."" Todd Burpos earnest search for meaning is not that different from yours or mine and his story demonstrates how far the pillars of certainty that once undergirded American life have been chewed away. Is heaven anything more than a collective delusion that helps us cope with a screwed-up world? Maybe not. Is democracy? Follow More Andrew OHehir.

But its Greg Kinnear-- with his characteristic affability -- that just about seals the deal.The film based on the best-selling book is infused with humor. By focusing on the bond between father and son it avoids being heavy-handed or preachy a wise choice for a movie that asserts heaven exists based on the earnest insistence of a precocious preschooler.Kinnear plays Todd Burpo a likable minister in a small Nebraska town. His devoted wife Sonja (Kelly Reilly) leads the church choir. They have two young children.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersWhen little Colton (adorable 6-year-old actor Connor Corum) becomes critically ill with a ruptured appendix all signs point to tragedy. Fortunately the little boy pulls through. Soon afterward he speaks matter-of-factly about spending time with Jesus and angels who sang to him while his body was in surgery.Though Todd is a man of faith he is taken aback by his sons assertions. But he questions Colton and the boy provides vivid details including encounters with dead relatives whom he never met.Todd researches near-death experiences and speaks to a psychologist at a local college in his quest to understand his son.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare The New York Times bestseller Heaven Is for Real hits the big screen Easter 2014. Its inspired by the real life story of a 4-year-old who survived a near-death experience and may have seen heaven. VPCWhen he tells his congregation about his sons experience hes peppered with questions. A key member of the church council (Margo Martindale) is deeply disturbed by the revelations. It makes their church a curiosity she says. Plus shes uncomfortable with the specter of hell that it raises. Herein lies one of the films more intriguing subplots not every church member is willing to accept unquestioningly that a little boy has seen heaven. Unfortunately the screenplay raises the issue of intra-congregational tension then glosses over it too easily.The movie may fail to convince skeptics but it takes a position in a manner digestible for the masses. The desire for an afterlife is almost universal and its existence is something most people have considered.Side-stepping denominational details the story focuses on an empathetic couple who worry over finances and grapple with adversity. In a sermon Todd posits that heaven may manifest itself in more recognizable guises than celestial choirs of angels ""Havent we already had a glimpse of something? In the cry of a baby the courage of a friend the love of a mother or a father?""Kinnear is the linchpin that makes the movie work. Had anyone else played Todd the story might come off holier-than thou. But Kinnear brings an appealing Everyman quality to the role. Casting is key to this films accessibility. Martindale grounds the film with her down-to-earth performance as a mom who lost her serviceman son; Thomas Haden Church is appealingly low-key as a local banker and young Corum is strikingly natural.Set amid scenic Midwestern farm country the cinematography by Oscar-winning Dean Semler is stunning.Are there sentimental corny moments? Yes a few. And Todds investigation of his sons claims are cursory at best.Coinciding with an awkward framing device of a young Lithuanian painter who claims religious visions Coltons depiction of Jesus looks distractingly like a better-coiffed Barry Gibb.But the veracity of a sweet little boys claims is not entirely the point. The film effectively raises an issue rarely tackled in mainstream studio movies with bankable actors. And it does so with a light touch resulting in a well-acted family-friendly and timely movie for Easter audiences that is just as much about appreciating life on Earth as it is about what comes after.. 173 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1kuMqiA",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/04/15/heaven-is-for-real-review/6891673/,200,heavenisforreal2,heavenisforreal,usatoday

(Allen Fraser) C Heaven Is for Real Genre Drama; Starring Greg Kinnear Kelly Reilly; Director Randall Wallace; Release Date Wide 04/16/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 100; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted April 27 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Nebraska pastor Todd Burpo (Greg Kinnear) spreads the news when his four-year-old son Colton (Connor Corum) recalls meeting Jesus in heaven during an operation. Colton didnt die at any point during his appendicitis surgery and his description of paradise (a rainbow-colored horse a light-eyed Jesus) doesnt jive with the one his father has been preaching. But even his dubious mother (Kelly Reilly) is convinced when Colton suddenly develops insight into things he shouldnt know about including his parents miscarriage and his dads angry outburst during the surgery. Based on a true story (and the 2010 bestselling book it inspired) Heaven is for Real has lots of sweet Rockwellian imagery of small-town life and family high jinks. What it doesnt have is dramatic tension Todds broken leg and bout with kidney stones are given far more harrowing treatment than any of the movies lightweight faith-versus-doubt squabbles. Theres no antagonist no resolution and no real climax -- just a series of mildly charming scenes in which Colton shares heavenly knowledge while his family reacts with awestruck tears.

Because heaven time is longer than Earth time Colton was able to observe many things that conformed to descriptions in Scripture of which he -- being 5 -- could obviously have had no prior knowledge. Pastor Burpos account of his sons journey became a huge best seller and is now an exceedingly gentle movie called Heaven Is for Real directed by Randall Wallace (We Were Soldiers). The piano music is spare. The light falls tenderly on these good Nebraskans and their family farms. As Todd Burpo Greg Kinnear is very fine with a light breezy manner but no trace of glibness. The Colton of little blond snub-nosed Connor Corum has an abstracted air that makes you think he still has ethereal beings drifting around in his head. The story too has been softened for a multiplex audience. In the book for example Colton says you only go to heaven if you believe in Jesus but onscreen theres no mention of an exclusionary rule. Nor are there long citations from Revelations (a work that has alarmed many commentators with its forecast of Armageddon and Holy War) to which Pastor Burpo turns for confirmation of Coltons visions. Details of the boys journey arent as literal. In the book for example the grandfather happens to be sitting beside the Holy Spirit when Colton enters the kingdom and the boy also mentions Mary either kneeling before the throne of God or standing beside Jesus. (""She still loves him like a mom"" Colton explains.) The filmmakers thinking must have been that Coltons accounts would be undercut by a resemblance to Hollywood movies and church pageants. Best to keep it vague. His credibility is challenged though by other characters. The boys mother Sonja Burpo (Kelly Reilly) has little patience for Pastor Burpos growing certainty that his son did indeed go somewhereA -- at least until she hears about her unborn child doing so well in heaven. Margo Martindale plays the church pianist whose son died in Iraq and doesnt think Pastor Burpo should be turning the weekly services into a media circus. ""Heaven and hell are concepts that have been used to control and frighten people"" she tells Burpo and pushes to have him replaced by another pastor -- which would be disastrous for the Burpos who cant pay their bills as it is. But soon she realizes that her skepticism is related to the death of her son -- and that she has to let go of her anger. Even the non-believing psychiatrist to whom Pastor Burpo first turned shows up smiling tearily for his last climactic sermon. A A I saw Heaven Is for Real in a Brooklyn multiplex at 950 p.m. on a weeknight. I thought Id have the place to myself but the theater was half full and no one talked during the movie. They were especially riveted in the scene where Colton takes his father to a pediatric oncology wing and -- as if he knows exactly who hes looking for -- zeroes in on an ashen emaciated boy who can no longer speak. Colton tells the boy its going to be okay better than okay. He has seen where the boy is going and knows that nothing bad will happen to him. I doubt many things -- almost everything to be frank -- but I have no doubt that my Heaven Is for Real audience slept better that night. Whatever works.

I gave the book to my mother. When she finished it she declared sweetly something she likely never doubted ""It is for real."" For my part I never got past my unease with the initial assertions Burpo -- the pastor of of Crossroads Wesleyan Church in Imperial Nebraska -- made about what the very young can absorb from the world around them even when they havent been formally introduced to certain concepts. Heaven can wait. The issue was what do little kids especially bright ones like Colton absorb from the silences and chatter of the adults around them? It turns out this reaction is not unlike that of the university psychiatry professor Burpo visits in the wise and touching movie ""Heaven Is for Real"" which opens today. Played with winning grace and believable concern by Greg Kinnear Burpo goes to the doctor because hes in no hurry to take Coltons wonderfully matter-of-fact recollections as proof of an actual visit to the hereafter. And one of the finest achievements of director Randall Wallaces smartly crafted family film is the way Todd Burpo becomes the storys most driven and sincere doubter. Wallace doesnt want audience members to leave reason at the ticket counter. Colton may have found Heaven but this movie is about seeking. Wallace could not have found a better ally in this journey than Kinnear. Theres an authentic ease to his portrayal of the pastor/father/volunteer fireman even as Burpo and wife Sonja (Kelly Reilly) are faced with financial pressures and more frightening the possible death of their wee son. Indeed the cast brims with quietly layered performances from Reilly as a supportive then aggravated mate to Margo Martindale and Thomas Haden Churchs portrayals of loving and increasingly worried church leaders. ""Heaven Is for Real"" unfolds in a way that reminds all comers that doubt is not a secular ailment. Which doesnt mean Wallace turns down the dimmer on the fellowship and comfort so many find in their faith and their church communities. There are snatches of sermons and scenes spent in church pews. Theres little hidden under a bushel here. Theres even a scene reminiscent of the moment the good folk of Bedford Falls pray on behalf of a desperate George Bailey. Sentimental and honorable ""Heaven Is for Real"" is kin to the Frank Capra classic Yes Coltons accounts tell of a wonderful afterlife. But ""Heaven Is for Real"" argues that this one too is a astonishing gift.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Apr. 16 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Tuesday Apr. 15 2014 502PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Randall Wallace Written by Chris Parker and Randall Wallace Starring Greg Kinnear Kelly Reilly and Connor Corum Classification PG Country USA Language English Superheroes demonic possessions and zombies are commonplace at the multiplex but movies about authentic religious miracles are so rare you tend to want to give them the benefit of the doubt or rather the benefit of the faith. Even among religious movies Heaven is For Real is something unusual - a contemporary miracle story based on real-life events. Adapted from the non-fiction bestseller of the same name by Todd Burpo (with Lynn Vincent co-writer of Sarah Palins autobiography Going Rogue) the movie is no religious fringe event. Its from a major studio (Sony) with an Oscar-nominated star (Greg Kinnear) adapted for the screen by Braveheart screenwriter Randall Wallace. This is the wistful and sincere Kinnear of Little Miss Sunshine and Flash of Genius (not the sleazy Kinnear of his recent TV series Rake) and hes well-cast as Burpo an affable Nebraska rural preacher and family man. While Todds folksy sermons delivered in shirtsleeves are enjoyed by his congregation this is the economically beleaguered heartland America. Along with his wife Sonja (Kelly Reilly) and son and daughter he lives in a church-supplied home next to the railway tracks. Although Todd does everything from work as a wrestling coach garage-door repairman and volunteer fireman he barely makes ends meet.The real troubles start when Todd starts running up medical expenses breaking his leg in a community softball game and then suffering an attack of kidney stones. When his cherubic four-year-old son Colton (Connor Corum) is whisked into emergency surgery for a burst appendix Todd is at the breaking point. While hes having his Job-like moment of anger with God in the hospital chapel Sonja is working the phone busy soliciting neighbours to pray for their son. After a montage of scenes of workers and parents across the town praying for Colton God apparently responds. He gives Colton a glimpse of heaven to bring back to the congregation in which he meets Jesus who rides a white horse. Winged angels sing familiar hymns and Colton meets long-dead relatives.For Todd the experience is more traumatic than joyous. He seeks advice from a psychologist (Nancy Sorel) who offers a plausible explanation of a ""near death"" hallucination. Todd finds her explanation insufficient. He also begins alienating everyone with his obsession about his sons strange experience. A church board member (Margo Martindale) who is embittered by her own soldier sons death wants Todd to quit the church. She finds the combination of his absenteeism and a media circus around Coltons supposed ""miracle"" an embarrassment. Even Sonja becomes frustrated with Todds nights on the Internet searching for answers. Things get so bad she even threatens to get a job to help pay the bills.Once Todd accepts that Gods revelation is a source of hope and strength rather than a burden things soon fall into place. Heaven is For Real stops feeling like a drama and more like an illustrated religious pamphlet. Though the movie doesnt spell it out Todds acceptance of the miraculous also led to the book and movie deal and helped clear away his mountain of medical debt.Taken at face value Heaven is For Real is intended as a contemporary illustration of the passage from the gospel of Matthew that unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Often though the examples of Coltons insights are so precious they border on creepy. When he talks of meeting a little sister with his mothers hair colour Sonja promptly identifies the child as an incarnation of her miscarriage sex unknown years before. In another scene Colton approaches a little girl undergoing cancer treatment and beamishly declares that ""No one will hurt you"" which is obviously not the same thing as saying nothing will hurt you.While Todd as pastor concludes that Coltons vision of heaven is paradise according to a four-year-olds understanding the movie too often seems aimed at a similar level of credulousness. In one of its more absurd moments Colton is asked to pick the true likeness of Christ from a lineup of pictures on the Internet. He selects a portrait painted by Lithuanian-American child artist Akiane Kramarik who also says she has visited heaven. The painting entitled Prince of Peace (which has been shown on Fox News Oprah Winfrey and CNN) portrays a contemporary looking blue-eyed man with a feathered hairdo and a coiffed beard. As several commentators have noted Kramariks impression of Jesus is a dead ringer for pop singer Kenny Loggins in his younger days. Miraculous indeed.

Jakes-produced adaptation of Todd Burpos Christian non-fiction best-seller will have a built-in audience especially on Easter weekend.After undergoing harrowing surgery for a ruptured appendix young Colton Burpo (Connor Corum) begins recalling his journey for his family Angels carried him to heaven where he met Jesus (played by Mike Mohrhardt whose face we never quite see) as well as God Coltons great-grandfather and the miscarried sister he never knew he had.Such talk frightens his older sister (Lane Styles) and worries his pastor father Todd (Greg Kinnear) and mother Sonja (Kelly Reilly).As Colton becomes more verbal about his supposed encounter the local paper in the small Nebraska town starts reporting the story. This leads some members of Todds congregation (Thomas Haden Church and Margo Martindale) to turn against the Burpo family.Though Todd sticks up for his son his faith is also tested. ""We ask these kids to believe this stuff"" he says to his wife ""but I dont even know if I believe it myself.""But Todd is captivated as we are by his sons innocence -- especially when Colton tells him things he couldnt possibly know such as how he saw his parents cope each in their own way during his near-fatal surgery.As Colton Corum does an excellent job of speaking softly yet with conviction and holding his gaze so we have time to study his sparkling blue eyes. But its the casting of Kinnear that offers the films strongest chance at transcending the faith-based demographic as the actor never fails to embody the everyman.Kinnears Todd is not just an inaccessible preacher. Hes also a volunteer firefighter coaches high school wrestling and is a garage door repairman. His family is also in debt. Their house which was offered as ""part of his salary"" sits near railroad tracks and shakes with every passing train. Thus many of the Burpo familys struggles mirror those of others in the heartland and effectively so.But in the way of gripping dialogue Kinnear doesnt have much to work with. We might have expected more from writer-director Randall Wallace who brought us the Oscar-nominated ""Braveheart."" But the material is pretty cookie-cutter and more typical of an afterschool special. However Wallace and co-writer Chris Parker do a good job of weaving in moments that should appeal to a mass audience.Just when it seems were being subjected to too much of ""the Word"" Colton cutely diverts our attention. During a road trip he suggests the family sing ""We Will Rock You"" instead of a hymn. Kinnear and Reillys chemistry also offers a favorable element. They appear genuinely sweet on each other and subtle sexual innuendoes add a bit of adult flavor.With the impressive computer-generated effects available today this film could have used a more sophisticated depiction of heaven. OK so its hard to imagine what heaven would look like but this version looks far too generic awash with glaring light and blurred angels.Its no surprise that faith hope and family prevail in this one. After all says Todd in one of his sermons ""In the end its about not feeling alone.""""Heaven Is for Real"" a Sony release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""thematic material including some medical situations."" Running time 100 minutes. Two stars out of four.___MPAA rating definition for PG Parental guidance suggested.

"Thank Heaven for Greg Kinnear review Heaven is for Real | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThank Heaven for Greg Kinnear review Heaven is for RealThank heaven for the acting talents of Greg Kinnear who elevates Heaven is for Real above its very modest ambitions.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterWed. April 16 2014Heaven is for RealStarring Greg Kinnear Kelly Reilly Connor Corum and Thomas Haden Church. Directed by Randall Wallace. 99 minutes. Opens April 16 at major theatres. PGThe good news is this in heaven everybodys young. The bad news you have to take a 4-year-olds word for it.Such is the struggle in Heaven is for Real based on the bestseller penned by real-life rural Nebraska pastor Todd Burpo about his son Coltons assertions that he visited heaven during life-saving surgery.Article Continued BelowBurpo is convincingly played onscreen by a very likable Greg Kinnear who remains a consistent screen presence even if the material hes been handed lately rarely matches his talents. Connor Corum left plays the son of Greg Kinnear a pastor who must figure out if the heaven described by his son is real.He plays the financially challenged pastor who struggles with a failing garage door business and a dwindling congregation. He always has time for coaching duties baseball practice sexily perky wife Sonja (British actress Kelly Reilly) and their two young kids.With Manitoba doing a convincing job standing in for the endless fields of Nebraska we get an American Gothic-style picture early on of a rural family trying to make ends meet.So when Colton (cutie Connor Corum managing to say his lines convincingly most of the time) falls desperately ill the Burpos turn to prayer and ask for the same from congregants including the pastors best pal a happy-go-lucky bank manager (Thomas Haden Church) and by-the-books church board member Nancy Rawling (Margo Martindale).The boys recovery comes with the casually revealed news that he spent some time in heaven when he was on the operating table.Coltons talk of Jesus horse Gods big chair and a reunion with the miscarried baby sister his parents didnt tell him he had soon gets out and it puts his father in a strange position.Is his son telling the truth? And if he is how can a preacher doubt the existence of heaven? Adding to Burpos struggles the church board is concerned that Coltons story is creating more of a freak show atmosphere than religious reflection on Sunday mornings. Perhaps its time for a new pastor.That struggle of faith and vocation -- and Kinnears ability to credibly carry it off -- is the most interesting element of an otherwise flat story.Director Randall Wallace (Secretariat We Were Soldiers) who also wrote the screenplay turns up the folksy charm while injecting some opposing views from a doubting university professor (Nancy Sorel). Of course they dont have a chance next to the power of heaven.The release of Heaven is for Real timed to coincide with Easter is hardly a fluke. This is a movie for the faithful and thats hardly bad business these days. Gods Not Dead complete with a cameo from bearded Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson was not screened for Toronto critics before opening last weekend. But trade publication Variety dismissed it as ""typically ham-fisted Christian campus melodrama"" and it earned a bottom-dwelling 17 per cent rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes.It also made more than 40 million since opening stateside four weeks ago with a production budget according to The Los Angeles Times of less than 3 million.Thats the kind of payoff studios pray for.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

My own family of recent Ozarkian extraction has had its share of deathbed visions -- a grandparent in hospice suddenly speaking to long-gone aunt so-and-so -- and of relatives feeling intuitions so sharp and accurate that I doubt even Richard Dawkins could comfortably tell them ""Im sorry my dear but you knowing that your sister was in danger from 100 miles away was just a trick of chemicals not anything divine."" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Not that such moments arent quirks of chemistry or the flowering together of feeling and memory and faith and electricity. At best theyre proof that a god or the universe itself takes a personal interest in us. At worst theyre proof of the sublime comforts our own brains can secrete into us. I believe my people felt these things and I hope the mystery juice flows when its my minds turn.Of course nobody I know would ask the rest of the world to credit these stories as more than personal anecdotes. Thats not the case with the family at the heart of Heaven Is for Real the book and film purporting to tell the true story of a four-year-old boys trip to heaven. Young Colton Burpo (Connor Corum) in surgery with appendicitis came perilously close to dying but managed to pull through. According to his fathers account Colton afterward expressed awareness of what transpired on Earth during the operation the community praying mother making teary phone calls father yelling at God in the hospital chapel. More confounding still Colton described meeting a grandfather he had never seen in life as well as a sister who had ""died in mommys tummy"" and neither mom nor dad had ever mentioned to the kid an earlier miscarriage.Film Details Heaven Is for Real RatingPG GenreDrama Running Time100 More Info Trailer Also in the movies vision are angels and clouds and a Jesus who looks like Kenny Loggins in a hotel bathrobe. As you might fear the movies literalization greatly cheapens the miracle of what our brains do with trauma; the heaven glimpsed on occasion in Heaven Is for Real is a skyscape/rec center infinitely less radiant than the films real-world Nebraska shot with honeyed-over Chamber of Commerce-pleasing light by Dances with Wolves cinematographer Dean Semler.This is after all a kids account of heaven one that as a couple skeptics in the movie point out draws directly upon the very images of heaven the kid has been fed his entire life. His dad (Greg Kinnear) is a preacher; his mom (Kelly Reilly) reads Narnia to him. Thats why Heaven Is for Real must go all in on the how-did-Colton-know-that? angle. Kinnears preacher dad one of those Dockers-sporting new-gospel ministers most comfortable in churches that look like refurbished carpet stores spends much of the film agonizing over whether or not to believe that Colton got a tour of the afterlife conducted by Jesus himself. Its the kids knowledge of the miscarriage that finally convinces the family that the story is true and that it must be shared with the world. (The familys financial travails prove a key plot point too but its hard to invest in the bill-paying drama of characters based on real people who sold their story to the movies.)Who knows what the real-life Colton truly saw? Whatever you believe if even the kids parents couldnt take it on faith until given extraordinary evidence it seems unfair to ask the rest of us just to accept their word for it. In the end its the very childishness of the vision that is supposed to stir us the warm hug of an idea of Christianity as onlythe crayon drawings and sing-alongs of Vacation Bible School. In Coltons heaven nobody wears glasses nobody gets old and as a blue-eyed Jesus assures him ""Nobody will ever hurt you."" It seems to be a family reunion set in the cartoon sky that kicks off The Simpsons. Am I crazy to think it might be preferable to dream of such a place than to spend eternity there?Unlike many of the features targeted to what Hollywood is calling the ""faith audience"" the movie is well-acted and shot often thoughtful and (intentionally) funny. Its portrayal of Christian family life is neither sickly sweet nor dreary -- Kinnear and Reilly paw at each other with the wholesome horniness of Rob and Laura Petrie. Simply put theres no Kirk Cameron to sink it.Kinnear given the chance to preach and parent and doubt turns in such a serious and layered performance you might dare to hope on occasion that the movie wont end with explicit endorsement of the veracity of mystical visions. Hes great at the mellow modern preacher-man stuff gliding through sermons but also at that Close Encounters-style man-mad-for-meaning stuff which results in sharply scripted domestic squabbles. The always welcome Margo Martindale and Thomas Haden Church shine in their roles as small-town believers all humility and decency even when theyre moved to consider voting Kinnears preacher out of his job. Martindale and Kinnear share a heartbreaker of a scene at a graveyard discussing grief and loss with quiet wisdom and real-feeling tears. Its as strong a portrayal of what faith actually means to the faithful as youll ever see in a contemporary movie a rare depiction of characters working to hold to what they believe rather than having it manifested before them via the magic of screenwriting.In the howlingly awful climax of course everything Martindales character struggles to believe in that graveyard scene is offered up as a stone fact with chintzy special effects. Its disheartening that a film that labors so hard to convince us that one kids familiar vision is real would itself start tossing such visions about like Oprah handing out gift bags. In such moments its not trying to convince you that you should believe; its making you feel shitty if you dont.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Todd (Greg Kinnear) shows Colton (Connor Corum) a picture of his grandfather in TriStar Pictures ""Heaven Is For Real."" (Allen Fraser/Sony Pictures) By Ann Hornaday April 15 2014 Follow AnnHornaday In ""Heaven Is For Real"" Colton Burpo the angelic 4-year-old son of a Nebraska pastor undergoes emergency surgery and while under anesthesia experiences a series of visions including watching his own operation observing the prayers of his anguished parents and meeting Jesus. At first Todd Burpo (Greg Kinnear) listens to Coltons stories with the amused forbearance of a mildly skeptical but proud parent He and his wife Sonja (Kelly Reilly) chalk up Coltons detailed visions to the stories and hymns hes been steeped in all his life. But when Colton mentions encountering people he never met or even knew existed Todd becomes convinced that his son really has glimpsed the afterlife a revelation that sends the preacher on a journey that will ultimately threaten his parish and his family. Viewers expecting ""Heaven Is For Real"" adapted from Todd Burpos best-selling memoir by the director Randall Wallace to be an anodyne allegory of reassurance and unconditional faith are in for something a little bit edgier and that turns out to be a good thing. Thanks to a sensitive performance from Kinnear as well as from a terrific cast of supporting actors what could have been merely a feel-good exercise in Eschatology Lite instead becomes a wholesome but also surprisingly tough-minded portrait of a man wrestling with his faith. Gentle well-meaning and suffused with the easygoing tolerance that largely characterizes the small Midwestern community where the Burpos live ""Heaven Is For Real"" undoubtedly supports Coltons contention that he visited heaven -- where he tells his father in the movie Jesus rides a multicolored horse and bands of singing angels apparently dont take requests (at least for ""We Will Rock You""). But the movie doesnt succumb entirely to credulity. Most of the film has to do with the painful questions Todd his wife and his parishioners grapple with as they contemplate the implications of Coltons startling disclosures first trying to fit them into scriptural understanding and then when that fails their own personal theology -- or something in between and unnamed. ""Why cant it just be a mystery?"" Todds wife asks at one point echoing the very thoughts of audience members who may not accept Coltons words as literally true but dont reflexively dismiss them either. (Theres no question however that ""Heaven Is For Real"" is a Christian movie One of its producers is megachurch leader T.D. Jakes.) As a sympathetic morally centered voice of reason Sonja Burpo joins Jennifer Connellys character in ""Noah"" as the wife of a man increasingly consumed by holy visions only to lose track of what he cares about most. In ""Heaven Is For Real"" Todd Burpo is introduced as a nice guy a modest garage-door installer whose conversational sermons appeal to his small middle-of-the-road evangelical congregation. When he appears to be more interested in preaching the Gospel of the Son of Todd than the Son of God parishioners begin to recoil In one testily effective church meeting a woman played by the magnificent Margo Martindale confronts Todd with the germane observation that the concepts of heaven and hell have been used for centuries to frighten and manipulate people. (Martindale is also at the center of one of the films most wrenching and pivotal scenes.) This push-and-pull represents the best of ""Heaven Is For Real"" which also has some humorous moments many coming from Thomas Haden Church as the town banker who can always be relied on for a deadpan remark or two. Wallace -- who uses a bright blue palette throughout the film the better to reflect the preternaturally blue eyes of Connor Corum who plays Colton -- sets up enough events leading to the youngsters experience that alternative explanations are readily available. Once or twice the director succumbs to facile logic and on-the-nose sentimentality especially in Coltons childish cotton-cloud recollections. But then again he is a child and the kitschy staging serves to reinforce the essential tensions that propel the film. With no less a steadfast atheist than Barbara Ehrenreich recently publishing a memoir of her own youthful encounter with the Great Unfathomable and neurosurgeon Eben Alexander declaring in Newsweek magazine that he too took a cosmic journey to the beyond ""Heaven Is For Real"" is well timed to coincide with collective speculation on transcendence in its varied most inexplicable forms. Presumably in keeping with Burpos book Wallace ends the film tying Coltons visions to those of another young person halfway around the world whose paintings of Jesus eerily coincided with the American toddlers impressions. That may be an intriguing turn of events but the postscript unfortunately detracts from the most powerful sequence in ""Heaven Is For Real"" wherein Todd finally seems to process Coltons journey into something personally crucial and spiritually transformative. In that moving climactic scene the preoccupations that have consumed him seem utterly beside the point compared with how in Gods name we can love our neighbors as ourselves. It may not involve singing angels or multicolored ponies but its still a question for the ages. Heaven Is For Real    (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for thematic material including medical situations.

Photo Allen Fraser Sony Pictures Releasing Heaven Is for Real review A crisis of faith 1 / 6 Back to Gallery ""Heaven Is for Real"" a well-acted Christian film about a boy who claims to see heaven goes over the top on many occasions but not for reasons that some might suspect. Based on a true story this is a movie about faith and how even the most devout of us can question it. Though you can probably guess from the title how it all ends up the scenes in which the characters struggle with their core beliefs are thoughtful and dignified. What rings less true is the Mom and apple pie vision of the Nebraska town where the story plays out. The first 15 minutes seem like a long-running Chevrolet car commercial though no puppies show up. This town is more heaven than heaven itself a place where intolerance racial tension and financial ills seem a world away. (People may talk about money problems but we dont buy it for a second.) ""Heaven"" has some nice things going for it though starting with its solid cast. Greg Kinnear one of our most undervalued actors is his usual solid self as Todd Burpo a pastor whose spiritual beliefs are thrown out of kilter when his 4-year-old son Colton nearly dies from appendicitis and casually announces afterward that hes paid a visit to heaven. More in Movies Jim Jarmusch directs Only Lovers Left Alive Watermark dives deep into around the world Marlon Wayans is serious about craft of comedy Todd laughs it off at first but Colton knows exactly what his mom and dad were doing while he was near death. The boys account divides the congregation but his observations continue to get more astonishing - and more difficult to dismiss. (Some of films most affecting scenes owe a great debt to ""The Sixth Sense."") Director Randall Wallace who wrote ""Braveheart"" gets an outstanding performance from Connor Corum the boy who plays Colton. In lesser hands this character could have been cloying but theres not a false note in the young actors work. At one point when Colton is describing heaven he appears to be more preoccupied with his Spider-Man figurine. Its a great moment The boy is just a boy and has no earthly idea what all the fuss is about. Yet maybe he does. Wallace is less successful with the heavenly scenes which threaten to get a little cheesy at times. We see billowing clouds and angels and Jesus and bright light but those images dont carry as much power as when Colton simply describes what hes witnessed. In fact the images of heaven somehow diminish the impact of the boys experience perhaps because heaven is just too profound for anyone to film. ""Heaven"" has a tough time getting to the finish line. Kinnear gives the requisite life-affirming sermon in fine fashion but then the film returns to an image of a young painter - an image presumably intended to buttress the argument that what the young Colton saw was real. Were the filmmakers afraid we needed more convincing or did the filmmakers need more convincing themselves? Heaven Is for Real Christian drama. Directed by Randall Wallace.

(Allen Fraser) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday April 16 2014 200 AM Title Heaven Is for Real Film Info With Greg Kinnear Kelly Reilly Connor Corum. The title says it all a film about a very real afterlife. Director Randall Wallace (140). PG. Area theaters. Lots of movies have messages and some people accept them before even going through the door. Those who believed in ""Heaven Is for Real"" when it was on the nonfiction best-seller list will likely find what theyre looking for in its movie adaptation which is its goal. Anyone wanting a more measured experience though will be disappointed. Despite its title the story winds up in an unsurprising place. This heavy-handed movie is simply a sermon its makers think we all should hear. That absolutism is one reason its nowhere near its obvious model the rightfully exalted ""Field of Dreams."" here subtlety is a victim of faith. Unquestioning belief is fine for a movie character ... but not for a movie. ""Heaven"" opens with gorgeous images and a gentle Copland-esque score that would fit right into ""Dreams."" Emerald-green grass and golden corn stretch ahead of the pickup truck driven by Todd Burpo (Greg Kinnear) a hardworking guy in small-town Imperial Neb. In addition to jobs as a garage-door installer and local fireman Todd is a pastor. Hes down-to-earth with an adorable family -- wife Sonja (Kelly Reilly) daughter Cassie (Lane Styles) 4-year-old son Colton (Connor Corum) -- at home. Out of the blue Colton develops an emergency case of appendicitis requiring immediate surgery. As it gets serious Todd and Sonja fear for their boys life. Colton survives but the kid speaks of events during the surgery he couldnt have known about such as Todds angry outburst in a chapel and Sonjas concerned call to her relatives. Colton was never clinically dead but reveals that during the operation he romped with Jesus who has a horse. Angels giggled with him. He spoke with an older child who said shes the baby Sonja miscarried. He met Todds long-dead father. The Burpos are concerned but blindly accept Coltons tale because as Todd says to a starchy nonbeliever psychologist ""What do you do when you come upon something beyond the realm of your comprehension?"" The movie never doubts Colton is telling the truth. As a film its shabby storytelling setting up a mystery its not curious enough to want to solve. Kinnear however manages to keep his portrayal grounded. Others might have let a bit of cynicism sneak in especially when the familys perilous resources might well conceivably be boosted by the 4-year-olds claims. (Newspaper story book deal TV appearance eventual movie? Hallelujah) But Kinnear restrains himself. Connor Corum plays Colton Burpo a 4-year-old who seems to have had a near-death experience in ""Heaven Is for Real.""

(Allen Fraser) Cassie (Lane Styles) talks to her parents (Kelly Reilly Greg Kinnear) while her brother Colton (Connor Corum) looks on in ""Heaven Is for Real."" (Allen Fraser) Director Randall Wallace doesnt. He tries to get dramatic mileage out of the concern among Todds church board that the kid is stealing their thunder and attracting the wrong kind of publicity. But thats disingenuous Wouldnt they be rejoicing for this kind of validation? ""Heaven Is for Real"" sets up several such straw man conflicts simply so it can say it won. If the movie were as pure as its Norman Rockwell images -- or as the Burpo family seems to be -- it wouldnt need to preach and push so hard.

"Review Heaven Is for Real soars best when grounded in earthly life - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Heaven Is for Real soars best when grounded in earthly life Connor Corum Greg Kinnear Allen Fraser / Sony Pictures Connor Corum left and Greg Kinnear star in ""Heaven Is for Real."" Connor Corum left and Greg Kinnear star in ""Heaven Is for Real."" (Allen Fraser / Sony Pictures) Betsy SharkeyLos Angeles Times Film Critic Conviction is the word that keeps coming to mind in watching ""Heaven Is for Real"" the latest faith-based film to debut this Passover-Easter season.It is there in Todd Burpos story of his 4-year-old sons near-death experience which the Nebraska pastor chronicled in his New York Times bestseller. It is present in the performances of stars Greg Kinnear Kelly Reilly Margo Martindale Thomas Haden Church and an adorable 6-year-old named Connor Corum. There is conviction in director Randall Wallaces approach and the screenplay he wrote with Christopher Parker. You see it in every frame with cinematographer Dean Semler an Oscar winner for ""Dances With Wolves"" making the springtime wheat fields around Winnipeg Canada look heavenly.PHOTOS 10 controversial films based on religion And it is certainly there in young Colton Burpos unwavering belief that when he was on an operating table not expected to survive an emergency appendectomy he spent time in heaven talking to Jesus hearing angels sing and meeting members of the Burpo family who died years before he was born.It all serves to make ""Heaven Is for Real"" one of the better faith-based films to come along. What the movie could use is a little more faith -- in the power of its message and the art of filmmaking. Instead ""Heaven"" is sincere to a fault and the closer it gets to heaven the more it wavers.The film is far better when it stays focused on the family and small-town life. That kind of rooted-in-the-real-world sensibility is what helped propel a book about a miracle into a modern-day phenomenon.As the title suggests Burpo wrote about his sons glimpse of the afterlife but the story is as much about a family in crisis with medical and economic troubles right up there with religious struggles. Indeed the core journey at ""Heavens"" heart is more about the road a man of faith traveled from doubt to belief than a tour of the spiritual realm. ""Heaven"" does not begin with Burpos story but with a beauty shot of a young girl in a rustic barn bathed in sunlight a canvas in front of her as she holds a paintbrush. Its meant to evoke art prodigy Akiane Kramarik whose portrait of Jesus young Colton would later single out as the only one that looked like the man he saw.PHOTOS Religious movies at the box officeMost of the film though unfolds in Imperial Neb. a farming community where Burpo (Kinnear) is a small-business owner volunteer fireman high-school wrestling coach pastor devoted husband and father. A self-deprecating saint in blue jeans and work boots with the actor underplaying his hand very well. Wife Sonja (Reilly) is strong-willed sensitive and sexy in a modest way. Cassie (Lane Styles) and younger brother Colton are cute smart kids. Its very much a traditional American family ideal sketched in here -- not enough time or money but plenty of love.A string of medical emergencies threatens to pull them under financially and emotionally starting with Burpo fracturing his leg during a softball game and capped by Coltons appendectomy. For some reason the filmmakers are quite true to the fathers various ailments -- his kidney-stone passing gets ample time. But Coltons close call is dispensed with quickly. Its like downplaying the genesis moment.As Colton recovers he begins to mention to his dad what he saw during the surgery. In Corum making his film debut director Wallace received a rare gift. The youngster does a remarkable job telegraphing an innocence and an absolute certainty whether hes describing sitting on Jesus lap or marveling at the rainbow-colored horse he spotted. In lesser hands the lines could have sounded ludicrous.But it is the rapport between Kinnear and the boy that really holds the film together. They make the father-son relationship believable in a way that grounds ""Heaven"" and gives it some of its best moments.To believe or not is the films burning question. It helps that Wallace who wrote the screenplay for ""Braveheart"" and directed ""Secretariat"" begins with Burpos uncertainty. The strains begin showing as the boy passes all the tests the father devises fundamentally forcing Burpo to believe. Close family friends and pillars of the community begin raising other questions. Nancy Rawling (Martindale) fears all the talk of heaven will taint the churchs credibility while the more pragmatic bank president Jay Wilkins (Haden Church) fears for his friends sanity and the churchs bottom line. There is a non-religious psychologist thrown in for good measure to be sure most of the doubters are addressed.BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenNot surprisingly the film spends a lot of time in church too much of it sitting there like filler. It becomes more centered any time Burpo begins one of his conversational sermons about how to live according to Christian principles. ""Heaven"" certainly doesnt shy away from frank religious talk. But at least when Kinnear is handling the narrative it is delivered in a low-key way that plays to the actors strength. That decent and slightly bemused appeal you find in nearly all his roles helped shape his gay artist in ""As Good as It Gets"" which earned Kinnear an Oscar nomination in 1998. He won a great many hearts with the sensibility as the patriarch of another close-knit family in 2006s ""Little Miss Sunshine."" It makes his compromised attorney in the current Fox TV drama series ""Rake"" both likable and forgivable. And the earthy and earthbound believer he creates in Burpo goes a long way to anchoring ""Heaven"" too.More difficult is the filmmakers depiction of what Colton saw. Jesus is there briefly in basic biblical-era wear face in shadows feet in sandals. There are gauzy angels with feathery wings but nothing too distinct. Fundamentally the hereafter is very cloudy like looking out a plane window at an expanse of billowy white. It all makes for a very ordinary-looking heaven mirroring the kind of images artists have used for centuries. Not very awe-inspiring which is somehow the hardest thing in this movie to believe.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com -------------------------------Heaven Is for RealMPAA rating PG for thematic material including some medical situationsRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Greg Kinnear Reviews Philosophy Small Businesses Secretariat (movie) 10 controversial films based on religion Hollywood tries to win Christians faith Religious tide turns against Noah Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-heaven-is-for-real-review-20140416,0,1805763.story#axzz2z2n8SEPa",200,heavenisforreal16,heavenisforreal,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Heaven Is For Real is a corny cross-promotional cheapie designed to hawk assorted Sony products and properties (Spider-Man count one action figure one lamp four posters) to megachurch audiences though apparently nobody bothered to tell Dean Semler. The perennially slumming cinematographer (Dances With Wolves) composes the film chiefly in horizontals dominated by swaths of blue creating visual rhymes between expanses of American flatland and the tight interior of a small-town church. His frames are headroom-heavy; nobody gets cut off at the hairline here and close-ups tend to be one-fifth subject and four-fifths space. What that means for the lay viewer is that Heaven Is For Real looks classier than it has any business being and creepier than its producers probably intended.Take for example a pivotal early scene in which evangelical everyman pastor Todd Burpo (Greg Kinnear) is told by his moppet son Colton (Connor Corum) that the latter had visions of the afterlife during his appendectomy. The heaven sequence is standard Sunday school watercolor material with twinkling stars translucent angels and a silhouetted Jesus. The conversation that bookends it though is a different thing altogether. Father and son are at a playground teetering up and down on a seesaw. The camera is mounted at the fulcrum which means that Todd and Colton appear to stay in place while the background appears to move. Additionally both are framed dead-center. Take away the special effects that illustrate Coltons tale of meeting Jesus and the praise-radio-ready music and what youre left with is a moment straight out of a psychological horror film.Occasionally it seems like thats the movie Kinnear is acting in. Buried within Heaven Is For Real is the germ of a great story involving a small-town pastor who experiences a personal crisis after being confronted with seemingly incontrovertible proof of the afterlife. The paradox of faith is that its most meaningful when founded on unknowns and unknowables and Coltons visions cheapen Todds beliefs by confirming them. To director/co-writer Randall Wallaces credit the movie fitfully engages with this theme including a scene in which Burpos church board (which features Thomas Haden Church who has a small and completely credible role as an evangelical businessman) excoriates those whod turn to the Bible for facts instead of guidance.Unfortunately Heaven Is For Real isnt really a movie about religion so much as an attempt to appeal to the broadest possible audience of conservative evangelicals. There are spectral fallen Marines smiling in dress uniform and paeans to paying for everything yourself and the power of small-town American can-do. (Note The movie was shot in Manitoba to take advantage of Canadian tax credits.) T.D. Jakes gets a prominent producing credit and Burpos church in Imperial Nebraska is depicted as multi-racial and multi-cultural though 2010 census records indicate otherwise.Theres also a lot of the overstuffed patronizing storytelling which tends to mar movies made for the evangelical market. The first two scenes begin with explanatory titles both of which identify the setting as ""the present day."" There is a smug atheist psychiatrist who operates out of a college alumni hall allowing the movie to pack all of its awkward swipes at academia into a single scene. There are the obligatory flashes of white used to indicate flashbacks in bad movies and bad TV shows alike. Yet throughout there are also moments--like the backwards dolly through an empty church or the shot of Colton standing in a darkened hallway watching his father--that hint at the movie that could have been.

Its inspired by the real life story of a 4-year-old who survived a near-death experience and may have seen heaven. Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1218 p.m. MST April 15 2014Greg Kinnear is good as a minister whose son says hes visited Heaven. Its not a screed but a film about doubt and faith. It falters however when we see a literal Heaven through the childs eyes.Connor Corum (left) and Greg Kinnear in a scene from ""Heaven Is For Real.""(Photo Sony Pictures)Story HighlightsThe story works best when Kinnear is working out his doubts.Wallace is less successful when he shows us a childs view of Heaven.The acting is good all around especially Kinnear Thomas Haden Church and Margo Martindale.Its certainly accurate to put ""Heaven Is for Real"" in the faith-based film category.But -- and this is not to belittle recent films like ""Son of God"" or ""Gods Not Dead"" -- it also works outside the sanctuary as it were. Although it has some serious flaws it rises above genre fare thanks to Greg Kinnears intriguing performance and the work of a good cast.The film based on the bestseller by Todd Burpo is not as forthright about the statement its title provides. What makes it interesting is that while by the end Burpo (Kinnear) thinks he has his answer its something he has to work out. This isnt a movie about blind faith. This is a movie about trying to figure out what faith is what it means and how it affects us. The film directed by Randall Wallace (""We Were Soldiers"" ""Secretariat"") fares less well when it wanders into more literal territory.The film opens with a day in the life of Burpo who fixes a garage door and agrees to be paid in donated carpet heads down to visit the fire station where hes a volunteer firefighter then goes over to the school to coach the wrestling team and then stops by the cemetery to put fresh flowers beside a headstone.All this before going to his idyllic home to his wife and children. Sonja (Kelly Reilly) is leading a choir group so when 4-year-old Colton (Connor Corum) runs out to see Burpo they decide to have a boys night out for pizza. But hes interrupted by a call -- someone at the hospital needs a minister.Aha. So in addition to being pretty much the best all-around guy in town. Burpo is also the pastor at a local church. Seeing him in action in shirtsleeves as he delivers down-to-earth sermons its easy to understand why his flock is growing.Then Colton develops a ruptured appendix and almost -- almost which is key -- dies. But he doesnt not even temporarily. Yet soon he is telling his father about people he saw in Heaven people he couldnt have known about.Naturally Burpo takes this information to the pulpit. But he doesnt offer it as fire-and-brimstone proof of Heaven. Instead he is trying to work out what it really means. Its an interesting approach but one his congregation isnt fond of. Not because they doubt theres a Heaven but because they believe Coltons story and his descriptions are too easy too pat.Where the film falters is when Wallace takes us to Heaven too where a handsome Jesus plops Colton on his lap and introduces him to other people there. Colton also sees angels and hears them sing asking them to sing ""We Will Rock You"" instead. (They dont.)Although this is meant to be a childs vision of Heaven it looks too much the part all warm glows and primary colors. As the congregation worries it is too simplistic. But its Colton who saw it so how can we argue?The Burpos face financial troubles (Thomas Haden Church is reliably good as the local bank president) so he cant afford to lose his job. It all builds to a sermon in which Burpo will try to sort things out.Kinnear brings the right touch to Burpo. He is not blinded by faith but is seeking it. Kinnears good-natured charm works well here and hes a good-enough actor to sell the doubt. Margo Martindale is always welcome; here she wants Burpo to get back to how he was before but has her own reasons for her wishes.""Heaven Is for Real"" may not sway non-believers but neither will it offend them. Despite its shortcomings at its best it does what any movie should faith-based or not It makes us think.Heaven Is for RealDirector Randall Wallace.Cast Greg Kinnear Kelly Reilly Thomas Haden Church.Rating PG for thematic material including some medical situations.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(AP Photo/Sony Pictures Allen Fraser) Allen Fraser This image released by Sony Pictures shows Greg Kinnear left and Kelly Reilly in a scene from ""Heaven Is For Real."" (AP Photo/Sony Pictures Allen Fraser) To misquote an old gospel lyric ""A child said it. I believe it. That settles it.""In reaching out to religious audiences filmmakers recently have sought inspiration from the Old Testament (""Noah"") the New Testament (""Son of God"") and academia (""Gods Not Dead""). Now Hollywood is taking its cue from a 4-year-old boy in Nebraska.Based on a book of the same name ""Heaven Is for Real"" is billed as the true story of Colton Burpo (Connor Corum) and his minister dad Todd (Greg Kinnear). Todd is the embodiment of small-town decency and works a second job at a garage-door company to support his family which also includes daughter Cassie (Lane Styles) and wife Sonja (Kelly Reilly) who leads the church choir. Times get harder when Colton suffers an attack of appendicitis and the familys insurance cannot cover all the hospital costs. The good news is that Colton survives. The really good news is that he comes back from his near-death experience with firsthand details about a very Christian heaven.Naturally after Todd starts preaching the news a dismissive professor gets a few moments of screen time to place Coltons story in a medical and multicultural context and disbelieving bullies emerge from the local diner and schoolyard. But Todd also faces the wrath of some congregants (led by Margo Martindale and Thomas Haden Church) and even his own wife who is suddenly more worried about their life savings than saving souls. Given its declarative title ""Heaven Is for Real"" should have built a more convincing case. Coltons widely publicized claims are not tested by anyone other than his own father who shows the boy a picture of a dead ancestor and asks if the old man was in heaven. Yes says Colton but everyone in heaven is young and nobody wears glasses (although we see them wearing clothes which look like they came from J.C. Penney). To further narrow the movies appeal to the Hallmark demographic blond Colton and a Lithuanian girl who also had a near-death experience describe a Jesus who looks like a blue-eyed Kenny Loggins.(The historical Jesus undoubtedly had dark eyes and probably a forked beard.)Written directed and acted by Hollywood pros ""Heaven Is For Real"" is a polished little movie with a hopeful message but when it literalizes the divine mysteries it opens the door to a Doubting Thomas.To misquote another song lyric ""If theres a rock n roll heaven Kenny Loggins wont be part of the band.""

Jakes Greg Kinnear and more in Plano for Heaven is for Real Heaven Is for Real is the kind of movie that will give faith-based filmmaking a good name.The problem with many Christian films is that they arent very good. They tend to be cheaply made with no-name casts amateurish direction and heavy-handed scripts that push a polarizing agenda.Heaven Is for Real -- in which a 4-year-old boy shakes up his family and a community with stories of going to heaven during a near-death experience -- avoids the many pitfalls.The production values are top-notch. Mind you this is a major studio release and not a shoestring-budget picture financed by a church. Its based on the experiences of Todd Burpo that were the subject of his best-selling book.The cast is excellent. Greg Kinnear who plays the boys father is an Oscar nominee (for As Good as It Gets) and Emmy winner (The Kennedys). Kelly Reilly who plays the mother is the lead in ABCs upcoming medical drama Black Box (premiering April 24). Supporting players include Emmy winner Margo Martindale (Justified) and Oscar nominee Thomas Haden Church (Sideways).Director-screenwriter Randall Wallace knows his craft. He wrote Braveheart and directed Secretariat.And as far as any Christian agenda is concerned Heaven Is for Real soft-pedals the sermonizing even when Kinnears character a Nebraska pastor addresses his congregation.Elegantly told and beautifully filmed the movie first lets moviegoers get to know and like this ordinary and appealing family. Then an extraordinary event prompts some serious soul-searching.The boy (played by 6-year-old Connor Corum) is rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. He survives and soon starts talking about his adventures in heaven which include meeting Jesus.Even his pastor father whos in the miracles business is skeptical. Its a childs vivid imagination right? But his stories about people he met in heaven include details that are hard to dismiss.Thats when the movie really gets interesting when Kinnear and his flock wrestle with doubts and try to figure out what they truly believe in.David Martindale is an Arlington freelance writer.Heaven Is for Real (B+)Directed by Randall Wallace.

After the contentious likes of ""Noah"" and ""Gods Not Dead"" Hollywoods season of Christian-themed cinema continues in relatively innocuous fashion with ""Heaven Is for Real"" a bland earnest yet appreciably restrained adaptation of Midwestern minister Todd Burpos inspirational bestseller about his young sons miraculous glimpse of eternity. Audiences not inclined to suspend their disbelief let alone take a leap of faith will have no use for the films corn-fed sincerity or its clean-scrubbed celestial visions. Still its something of a relief to report that the movie isnt quite the vomitous bucket of spiritual saccharine the ads would suggest and those willing to engage may be pleasantly surprised by some of its understated virtues a carefully open-minded appeal to skeptics a wry sense of humor that wards off sententiousness at key moments and a fine cast of name actors (led by Greg Kinnear) who bring much-needed class and conviction to a thin tidy little story of what God giveth and taketh away. That Christian moviegoers have had more to choose from recently (and with still more on the horizon including ""Left Behind"" and ""Exodus"") should do little to diminish the faith-based appeal of ""Heaven Is for Real"" which is opening smack in the middle of Holy Week -- prime B.O. real estate that Sony/TriStar should capitalize on handsomely. Marking the first joint venture between reliable hitmaker Joe Roth and megachurch leader T.D. Jakes the movie stands to benefit from church-fueled word of mouth a robust social-media profile and perhaps most of all the thousands of readers who embraced Burpos simple yet not uncontroversial account of his son Coltons out-of-body experience which left the 4-year-old convinced hed visited heaven and sat in Jesus lap. Screenwriters Randall Wallace (who also directed) and Christopher Parker have the good sense to work their way up to that epiphany gradually immersing us first in the rhythms of life in the small prairie town of Imperial Neb. Todd Burpo (Kinnear) works as a volunteer firefighter a high-school wrestling coach and a pastor at Crossroads Wesleyan Church where he preaches eloquent heartfelt sermons every Sunday while his wife Sonja (Kelly Reilly ""Flight"") and their two young children Cassie (Lane Styles) and Colton (Connor Corum) look on in quiet adoration. Theirs is a happy but hardly perfect existence Todds various jobs barely manage to pay the bills and there are a few less-than-subtle hints of some painful past tragedy that he and Sonja havent entirely shaken off. Things grow worse when Todd endures a Job-like series of physical ordeals breaking his leg and developing severe kidney stones (the characters real-life breast-cancer scare seems to have been left on the cutting-room floor) which put him out of work for a long stretch. Yet a far graver medical emergency strikes young Colton who is rushed to the hospital with a ruptured appendix and little chance of survival occasioning a solemn montage of closed eyes and bowed heads that begins with his parents and fans out to include other members of the church community. Their prayers are answered After 11th-hour surgery Colton makes a full recovery. But hes not quite the same little boy he was before as becomes clear from his subsequent running commentary about what transpired on the operating table. A flashback filmed from a souls-eye view shows him floating high above his own unconscious body -- and then before you can say ""The Lovely Bones"" or ""Enter the Void"" hes walking into a church much like Crossroads Wesleyan where hes greeted by a choir of singing angels and in the nail-scarred flesh Jesus himself (Mike Mohrhardt his face strategically hidden from view). Colton recounts all this not with precocious wide-eyed wonder but rather with a rambling matter-of-factness that at times drifts into boredom or impatience -- a tactic that along with a refreshingly non-cloying performance from button-cute newcomer Corum and several instances of offbeat humor helps to neutralize some if not all of the cheese factor. Whether they count as visions hallucinations or psychic remnants of an actual experience the recurring images of Coltons heaven cant help but feel overly kitschified and sanitized all puffy clouds billowing robes and blinding flashes of white. Its a dully immaculate rendering of the afterlife that induces a flicker of curiosity about what the movies version of hell would look like less sparkly and lemon-fresh perhaps but also more interesting by a mile. But hell never really enters the movies moral equation as Colton drawing out his story over many tellings and retellings (in a way that makes it impossible not to suspect a modicum of dramatic embellishment) advances a reassuring theory of the cosmos in which our dead loved ones are waiting to be reunited with us for all eternity. Its the guileless simplicity of this account marbled with details and insights that no child could possibly fabricate (shades of ""The Shining"") that compels Todd to believe his son is telling the truth. Soon he begins sharing Coltons story with others including a journalist (Julia Arkos) an unbelieving child therapist (Nancy Sorel) and eventually his own parishioners whose generally bewildered reactions open a rift between Colton and the church. Its in exploring that rift -- and acknowledging the difficulty even the most faithful viewers may have in swallowing the material -- that ""Heaven Is for Real"" feels most persuasive honest and dramatically substantial. The film is fortunate to boast sterling character actors like Thomas Haden Church and Margo Martindale both playing respected church elders who bring a healthy dash of skepticism to the proceedings (Martindale in particular manages to suggest a fully developed character while effectively functioning as a mouthpiece for all the bitter cynics in the audience). As Todds wife and Coltons mother Reilly expresses her characters own doubts and reservations to more plaintively emotional effect. And Kinnear who fits right into this homespun Nebraska setting while also standing slightly apart from it is perfectly cast as the salt-of-the-earth reverend -- clearly driven by his spiritual passion and his love for his family yet with a zeal that borders on obsession as he follows his sons testimony to its sentimental conclusions. (Spoiler alert There will be hugs.) Depending on your particular perspective on the spiritual bromides being prescribed here the measured conclusions of ""Heaven Is for Real"" may induce anything from a sigh of relief to a roll of the eyes. Wallace a reliable pro at turning out stolid conventionally stirring entertainments (""Secretariat"" ""We Were Soldiers"" the screenplay for ""Braveheart"") has made no secret of the strong Christian influence on his body of work and hes clearly out to satisfy his target audience while remaining somewhat accessible to those outside it. Its an admirable impulse that nonetheless leaves you feeling the film has somehow missed its mark copping out with a mealymouthed almost relativistic reading of the cosmic conundrum it has presented us with Your heaven my heaven lets call the whole thing off. Making a handsome stand-in for Nebraska farm country the films Winnipeg locations are lushly photographed in widescreen by Dean Semler though the film lingers perhaps a beat too long on gently rustling stalks of wheat for its own good. Reillys quavering rendition of one of the great hymns ""Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing"" offers a lovely respite from the relentless assault of Nick Glennie-Smiths score.

Viewers sitting through to the end of the movie was more of a miracle than the actual story. Nothing extraordinary here. This should have been a made for TV movie Reply Bob Holt says April 18 2014 at 1025 pm Too bad this negative review is the first post for this movie as the movie received a standing ovation tonight at an Austin Texas theater. A fairly sophisticated audience in a very liberal town. I reluctantly went with my wife to see it and was blown away in a gentle way. Highly recommend it. Reply mznewy says April 17 2014 at 444 am I read the book and saw the movie. I was a little disappointed in the movie because it just didnt tie it together the way the book did. It was too long and seemed to miss some of the key points of the book. Overall it is a good movie. Maybe if I hadnt read the book so many times and had my own imagery of the movie I would rate it better. I would wait for the DVD. Reply Don Clark says April 16 2014 at 320 pm Well done movie that I suspect will wake up some people to the fact of life and beyond. I enjoyed it and it is still on my mind. A person I was sitting next to plans on seeing it again. Reply Tim says April 15 2014 at 730 pm Thank you Sony Pictures Entertainment and TriStar Pictures for seeing the Light.......again. Reply Tim says April 15 2014 at 710 pm Joe Leydon joeleydon Moviegoers devoted to faith-based fare will flock to megaplexes for ""Courageous"" easily the most polished production so far from brothers Alex and Stephen Kendrick the prolific and increasingly accomplished filmmaking pastors at the Sherwood Church of Albany Ga. Their latest effort appears poised to surpass the near-miraculous B.O. success of ""Fireproof"" one of 2008s highest-grossing indies of any denomination and should enjoy a long afterlife as homevid product. Mainstream breakout success likely will prove elusive as the pic will prove too preachy for many tastes but even agnostics could respond to the Kendricks uplifting message regarding responsible parenting. Reply Bob Holt says April 18 2014 at 1018 pm Just saw the movie tonight - didnt read the book. Loved it Had no expectations except hoped it wasnt cheesy. was blown away by the young boy as an actor. The director pulled a wrinkle in the matrix level of performance out of him. Kinnear was also terrific in a role that could have been cartoonish. The packed audience at the Austin theater gave it a standing ovation - something I used to see in New York when I lived there but have never seen here. the movie made me think of Steve Jobs last words before he died - according to his sister - ""Wow Oh Wow Wow."" Go see it and judge for yourself. It will be a good time regardless of your conclusion. Reply Blonde blue-eyed Jesus says April 15 2014 at 634 pm Ive lost respect for so many of my favorite actors who did this piece of crap. Kinnear Hayden Church Martindale...whyyyyy? Reply Jerry Smith says April 16 2014 at 758 am Blond blue-eyed Jesus is a working actor - named MIKE Mohrhardt not Mark. And being asked to play the son of god with Kinnear Hayden Church and Martindale probably sounded like a great opportunity he was thrilled to accept given that its his career and all. Reply fmwarner says April 15 2014 at 739 pm Let me guess - you havent seen the movie and despite the mildly positive review youve decided its a piece of crap based on the subject matter. Bravo. Reply Dale Hopson says April 15 2014 at 648 pm WHY? For a paycheck Reply Paramount Employee says April 15 2014 at 605 pm Finally a movie for the ""real chosen people."" Reply Neil says April 15 2014 at 604 pm Hell with the movie The review is so well written Hahahaha Reply See All 13 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Westworld Divorce amp; Insecure Get Premiere Date On HBO Lindsay Lohan Without Engagement Ring Egor Tarabasov Wedding...

Photo Credit AP / Allen Fraser advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A little boy emerges from surgery with stories of a visit to heaven. Rated PG BOTTOM LINE A supposedly true story that uses faulty logic to reduce the complexity of faith to a fairy-tale. By rights it should displease atheists and believers alike. CAST Greg Kinnear Connor Corum Kelly Reilly LENGTH 140 You might think that proving the existence of God is one of those philosophical chimeras that people stopped chasing many centuries ago. Rene Descartes St. Augustine and not even Jesus Christ could do it at least to the satisfaction of strictly logical minds. But then isnt that the whole point of faith? Believers believe without proof not because of it. Thats not good enough for ""Heaven Is for Real"" based on the nonfiction bestseller by Todd Burpo pastor of Crossroads Wesleyan Church in tiny Imperial Neb. The story goes that Todds 4-year-old son Colton entered emergency surgery for a burst appendix and emerged with reports of a visit to heaven. As proof Colton (played by newcomer Connor Corum all blue-eyes and cherubic cheeks) said he saw winged angels sat on Jesus lap and spoke to his great-grandfather. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""Heaven Is for Real"" tries to bolster this story by casting Todd (played with great sensitivity by Greg Kinnear) as a reluctant believer. If so Todds lack of critical thinking skills is jaw-dropping. Hes not convinced that Colton really met Jesus until Colton mentions seeing the crucifixion wounds. That settles it. When the local townsfolk (Margo Martindale and Thomas Haden Church play the Burpos married friends) begin to balk at Coltons fanciful story Todd sticks by his son. Kelly Reilly plays the familys long-suffering matriarch Sonja Burpo. Directed and co-written by Randall Wallace whose credits include ""Braveheart"" and ""Secretariat"" (two not-so-coded religious allegories) ""Heaven Is for Real"" insists on having its faith and proving it too. It paints Todd and his son as persecuted saints of a sort yet repeatedly offers embarrassingly unconvincing ""facts"" to support their cause. As a result the story begins to sound like malarkey at best charlatanry at worst. By rights ""Heaven Is for Real"" ought to draw scorn from both atheists and believers alike. Its a mockery of basic logic that also manages to strip religious faith of its complexity mystery and nuance. It was Joseph Campbell who said that when myths are turned into facts they lose their transformative power and become dogma. ""Heaven Is for Real"" wants it that way. 301 EntertainmentHeaven is For Real trailer PLOT A little boy emerges from surgery with stories of a visit to heaven. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG CAST Greg Kinnear Connor Corum Kelly Reilly LENGTH 140 BOTTOM LINE A supposedly true story that uses faulty logic to reduce the complexity of faith to a fairy-tale.

Connor Corum stars in ""Heaven Is for Real.""Photo AP/Sony Pictures In his first major-studio lead since ""Flash of Genius (2008) Kinnear injects much-needed humor and astringency into his role as Todd Burpo a Nebraska pastor whose faith is tested when his 4-year-old son Colton (Connor Corum) nearly dies from a burst appendix in 2003. After his miraculous recovery Colton claims to have visited heaven seen Jesus and angels -- and had conversations with long-dead relatives (including a stillborn sister) he didnt even know existed. Skeptical at first -- his encounter with a psychologist is easily the shakiest in the movie -- Todd not only comes to believes his sons story he goes public with it. This generates a lot of publicity which makes some members of his congregation uncomfortable. Even his closest friends a couple played very well by Margo Martindale (""August Osage County) and Thomas Haden Church (""Sideways) wonder if hes lost it and should be replaced at the church. Although based on a best-selling book by Burpo and co-produced by megachurch mogul the Rev. T.D. Jakes ""Heaven Is for Real is blessedly free of sanctimony -- even mildly suggesting theres a downside to believing in hell and eternal damnation. Greg Kinnear and Kelly Reilly share a moment in ""Heaven Is for Real.""Photo AP/Sony Pictures Director Randall Wallace who also co-wrote the script is not known for his light touch -- he did the screenplay for ""Braveheart and his directorial rap sheet includes ""We Were Soldiers and the lachrymose ""Secretariat. But Kinnear and English actress Kelly Reilly (of the Robert Downey ""Sherlock Holmes"" films) who plays patient Burpos wife manage to depict a family in financial and spiritual crisis with some subtlety despite dialogue thats often way too on-the-nose. Wallace seems to be going for a ""Field of Dreams vibe but the films endless Midwestern prairie vistas are way too visually bland for that. A framing story involving a painter doesnt work at all. And the films brief glimpse of heaven and angels (with a backlit Jesus) is laughably cheesy. This agnostic thinks the makers of ""Heaven Is for Real should have had the faith to let audiences decide whether little Colton is telling the truth about his near-death experience without resorting to the digital equivalent of dry ice.
