But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Alexander The Not-So-Great washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Alexander The Not-So-Great Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 26 2004 AS FAR as making a movie about Alexander the Great Oliver Stone knew at least two things He could adhere to the known facts about the boy king and still have a salacious blood-and-gutsy story. Plus with all the unknowns and what-ifs that are also part of Alexanders history the director could take the ball and run even farther with it. Or fumble. ""Alexander"" which takes us from the legends earliest childhood to his final undoing in India at age 32 is enjoyable in some places but dreadful in others. Its boring here and exciting there. And its almost always goofy. Its 150 million worth of large-scale battles bacchanalia and overwrought writing -- particularly in its rendition of Alexander (Colin Farrell) as a mama-whipped militarily gifted but emotionally unstable conqueror. Alexander can fool Darius and his overwhelming army of Persians at the Battle of Gaugamela. But the kid just cant say no to Olympias (Angelina Jolie) his manipulative vivacious and python-stroking mother who seems to be pulling all his psychic strings even thousands of miles away. (""Thats a high ransom she charges for nine months lodging in the womb"" complains Alexander after hearing yet another maternal demand.) Even when hes lifting a mug of drink to his lips Alexander can see Olympiass face crawling with snakes in the watery reflection. Dr. Freud they could have used you 2000 years earlier. Sexually Alexanders a mess. As a kid he watches his father (Val Kilmer) the burly animalistic Philip II rape his mother so he tries some of the same rough stuff with his feisty wife Roxane (Rosario Dawson). Hes happier it seems with his lifelong male lover Hephaistion (Jared Leto) who follows Alexander to the bitter end of his campaign. Alexanders homosexual side is only bashfully explored. (Apparently some things even Oliver Stone couldnt do in a Warner Bros. picture.) Alexanders friend and former general Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) whos the movies narrator saucily tells us the only thing that defeated the Macedonian king was ""Hephaistions thighs."" But in this movie the two men merely nuzzle heads. There are no thighs just whispers. Despite nearly three hours of screen time Stone and co-writers Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis give us a little bit of everything and ultimately a whole lot of nothing. Yes we see the moment when Alexander first sets eyes on and tames wild horse Bucephalus. We learn about his obsession with ancient Greek warrior Achilles and his male lover Patroclus. And we meet three significant figures in Alexanders life Hopkins as Ptolemy (his younger counterpart played by Elliot Cowan) Christopher Plummer as Aristotle and Brian Blessed as Alexanders wise wrestling instructor. But the scenes of these last three men could easily have been excised. Actually its hard to know if any scene fits into this movies overburned scheme of things. Farrell puts a lot of energy into his role but his characters pulled and tugged in so many directions were not sure what to make of him. Hes tough in the battlefield anguished over mutiny from his soldiers torn between lovers impulsive and fearful heedlessly brave and fitfully sensitive. Were even supposed to see Alexander as a visionary who keeps stating his determination to create a world in which Macedonians shed their disdain for Babylonians and other defeated peoples. Its amazing really that he can persuade his army to leave downtown Pellas let alone take on Europe North Africa and Asia. But follow him they do. And so we must too with only our luminous watches to lead us through the torturous darkness. ALEXANDER (R 175 minutes) -- Contains nudity rape scenes battlefield violence and obscenity.

"Alexander A Crying Shame washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Alexander A Crying Shame Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday November 24 2004 If you played a word-association game with ""Alexander the Great"" youd probably come up with ""conqueror"" ""king"" ""warrior"" ""legend"" ""despot"" ""wastrel"" or ""killer."" Unfortunately Oliver Stone has chosen to build his epic of the Macedonian military genius around a word highly unlikely to make the list ""crybaby."" In Stones view this is a highly neurotic young man whose emotions far from being repressed or disciplined as one would expect of a great soldier of the 4th century B.C. are worn on his sleeve except of course that he doesnt have sleeves the shirt still being two millennia down the road. So he wears them on his wrist -- and its a limp one. Thats the weirdest aspect of the extremely weird if absurdly expensive movie. Stone gives himself much credit of ""telling the truth"" about Alexanders bisexuality as if its some progressive badge of honor but at the same time he cant get away from the cruelest least imaginative stereotyping His Alexander as expressed through the weepy histrionics of Colin Farrell is more like a desperate housewife than a soldier. Hes always crying his voice trembles his eyes fill with tears. Hes much less interesting except as a basket case than Richard Burtons Alexander of far less enlightened times -- 1956 -- in Robert Rossens ""Alexander the Great."" Burton got Alexanders dissipation but also his martial spirit; this was after all one of the great light-cavalry commanders of all time and a general who fought by leading his troops sword in hand not directing them from some safe hill. But in this one you think Teri Hatcher could kick this twerps butt. In many ways the movie feels 50 years old already. It offers the standard 1950s melodramatic theory of Alexanders sexual orientation the scheming sexualized domineering mother and the distant uncaring father. So much for todays theories of genetic predetermination. Yet at the same time it fails to account for what was remarkable about Alexander rather than what was not. His bisexuality after all is fairly commonplace in the world of this movie while his will to conquer and his skill in actually bringing it off are not. But we never see what drives him. He never projects much in the way of ambition or vision; his fixation is always emotional and the occasional attempts to match his motives to his accomplishments dont resonate. Equally we never sense his animal magnetism -- Farrell showed more on Letterman on Monday night than he does in three hours of world conquest -- or his leaders charisma. He seems to motivate by pouting or holding his breath. The movie lacks any convincing ideas about Alexander. Stone advances but one the notion that Alexander was an early multiculturalist who wanted to ""unify"" the globe. He seems not to recognize this as a standard agitprop of the totalitarian mind-set always repulsive but more so here in a movie that glosses over the boy-kings frequent massacres. Conquerors always want ""unity"" Stalin a unity of Russia without kulaks Hitler a Europe without Jews Mao a China without deviationists and wreckers. All of these boys loved to wax lyrical about unity while they were breaking human eggs in the millions and so it was with Alexander who wanted world unity without Persians Egyptians Sumerians Turks and Indians. It has the same biopic failings as any MGM product of the mid-30s in that it rushes from high point to high point it synopsizes (he fought dozens of battles; it dramatizes only two) and it whitewashes truth (Alexanders ruinous retreat from India gets about four seconds). The mechanism of the plot is trite Ptolemy one of A-teams leading generals now grown august and stentorian as only Anthony Hopkins can project august stentorianism recalls the days of Alex as he dictates his memoirs. Yak yak yak blah blah blah. Hopkinss Ptolemy is a wordy old geezer and his prose style as crafted by Stone himself and co-writers Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis has that kind of purple glaze Hollywood has always used to signify ""in olden times."" Other trite old-timey signifiers include too much Maybelline eyeliner (and Im talking about the guys) too many subtitles in a font that might be called Greco-Roman 36-point Bodoni with Vs for Us and thunderous bad battle music that seems to have been composed only for trumpet and trombone. As a director of performance Stone is hopeless. For one thing Farrell so overacts with the wah-wah-wahs gushing that none of the other young Greek and Macedonian generals makes an impression. Since all these young men are stunningly handsome in shaggy hair and cool clothes its sort of like hanging out with a rock band. Musicians however dont have to have personalities while characters do. Alexanders great love was said to be Hephaistion who is played in the film by Jared Leto but unless you know Jared Leto by face even late in the movie youll have no idea which one he was. I thought he was this other guy equally handsome equally vapid equally unmemorable whom Alexander prongs with a spear in a drunken rage late in the movie. But that was some other guy. Then comes the moment when we Meet the Parents. Brother talk about Christmas with the cranks Dad -- the Macedonian king Philip from whom Alexander inherited the tiny empire he was to build into a gigantic one -- is played by Val Kilmer in hearty barbarian mode. He seems to have wandered in from a remake of ""The Vikings"" shooting in the next Moroccan village down the coastline. Loved the one-eyed thing which appears to be a Stone fetish. The movie is full to brimming with one-eyed men which demonstrates two things The Greek battle helmets had eye slots and there was extra money in the makeup budget for putty. Then theres Angelina Jolie as Mom. Really words fail me here. But lets try Give this young woman the hands-down award for best impression of Bela Lugosi while hampered by a 38-inch bust line. Though everyone else in the picture speaks in some variation of a British accent poor Jolie has been given the Transylvanian throat-suckers throaty sibilant vowels as well as a wardrobe of snakes. She represents the spirit of kitsch that fills the movie and with all her crazed posturing and slinking its more of a silent movie performance than one from the sound era. Theda Bara call your agent. And finally the battles. Hollywood should realize that these big tiff things arent nearly as impressive as they once were particularly in the aftermath of three years of Iron Age combat apotheosized in the great ""Lord of the Rings"" pictures; when youve seen Orcs and hobbits fighting for the future of the world its a little hard to get excited about Persians and Greeks fighting over someones imperial hubris 2300 years ago. To be fair the film does a pretty good job of explaining and dramatizing the tactics of Gaugamela (thought to be near Mosul Iraq today) where the clever Alexander with 40000 men outthought and outfought Darius IIIs 200000 including a daring cavalry strike (which Alexander himself led) that drove Darius from the field. But theres nothing singular here. When you see what the Chinese are doing with action (in the upcoming ""House of Flying Daggers"") and even what younger and more inventive American directors are doing these fights seem very much a part of the rest of the movie. Its the same-old same-old of charging into battle from half a century ago. Even amplified by CGI which can multiply a thousand extras into 40000 nothing in the war-making feels unique. We dont learn anything new about this kind of fighting and the imagery -- bigger in scale but not bigger in vision from the past -- feels stale. The one fresh image that of Alexander on horseback rearing at an enemy pasha on elephantback has been diluted of its power by overexposure on television ads. Like every other second of more than 10000 seconds in ""Alexander"" it doesnt engage in the least. Alexander (173 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for battle violence and sexual scenes and themes.

After Alexander ( 1/2 out of four) dont look for Oliver Stone to be on anybodys A-list to direct and co-write a screen treatise on the life and times of Methuselah. Behind every world conqueror Angelina Jolie is Queen Olympias the ambitious mother of the young Alexander (Colin Farrell). Warner Bros. Stones emotionally arid three-hour epic arrives on the heels of Troy which fell short of becoming the event picture its budget necessitated despite intermittent entertainment value. So what are audiences going to make of a movie that has neither dramatic focus nor a single memorable performance aside from one or two that are memorable for the wrong reasons? (Related video See a preview of Alexander) The drudgery begins with an instantly fatiguing framing device Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy blathering on 40 years after Alexs death about how this uncommonly generous visionary largely eschewed plundering after capturing most of the world by the time he died at age 32 in 323 B.C. With this out of the way we flash back to the most dysfunctional family in Macedonia one-eyed King Philip (Val Kilmer) young son Alexander (wholl become Colin Farrells conquering Clairol blonde) and serpent-fancying Queen Olympias (Angelina Jolie). Jolie would seem to be a natural for a role requiring the use of poisonous pet snakes as necklaces in her bedroom. But her character puts into play a problem Alexander never quite licks. Its most entertaining scenes -- in fact about the only ones that come to life -- border on camp which can hardly have been Stones intention. Camp rules in every scene with snarling Jolie who looks to be about 25 when her offspring is 30 give or take. We see camp take hold again during Alexs wedding night to a Persian a scene in which bride Rosario Dawson is all claws catlike sounds and unencumbered breasts. The heavy homoeroticism between Alex and longtime friend Hephaistion (Jared Leto) is far less specific than the wedding night yet comes off as a side issue given that both the story line and lead actor fail to take hold. Intentional clutter and confusion in battle scenes dont help though the stuntmen who worked with the elephants earned their money. The movie does achieve a level of scope and majesty missing from new-on-DVD Alexander the Great (1956) but that version has actors with built-in emotional clout Richard Burton Fredric March Claire Bloom. Its tempting to wonder whether the subject is too elusive for screen treatment. One thing is certain This is Stones weakest movie of the past 20 years and its unlikely to make any kind of blip.

Directed by Oliver Stone from a screenplay by Stone Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis. 173 minutes. Rated R for violence and some sexuality/nudity. Several theaters. So heres something I never expected to say about a big-budget Oliver Stone film starring Colin Farrell Angelina Jolie and Val Kilmer Its dull. Despite Stones flirtations with Alexanders supposed bisexuality and Alexanders mothers weird snake obsession and some enormous (though CGI-enhanced) battle scenes featuring armies advancing with massive spears as if theyre about to do a group pole vault ""Alexander"" is dull. Despite a cast full of actors capable of delivering the kind of energy jolt that could bring a corpse back to life -- its dull. Despite Rodrigo Prietos dramatic cinematography Jenny Beavans sleek costumes and Jan Roelfs elegant production design -- its dull. And did I mention its three hours long? ""Alexander"" admittedly is a tough story to bring to the screen. The legendary warrior fought battle after battle winning every time before his death at age 32 by which time he had conquered the vast majority of the known world. But who can afford these days to stage a movie full of massive battle sequences? Not Stone so he gives us only a few filling the rest of the movie with exposition delivered in a strange polyglot of accents and framing it in an elaborate flashback structure as old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) lectures scholars -- and us -- on why Alexander was great. (If the movie had worked as it should Ptolemy wouldnt have had to tell us.) Farrell in blond hair and oddly speckled eyebrows (those ancient Macedonian hair salons clearly had a lot to learn about dyeing techniques) continues his unfortunate pattern of giving hints of the great actor he could be if only he had the right material. Theres an early moment in ""Alexander"" during a riotous party when he flashes with sudden anger and its electric -- you get a sense of this young man as a short fuse awaiting a spark. But Stone doesnt seem interested in exploring the character; rather he gives us constant images of the kohl-eyed young men of Alexanders retinue (the warrior kings bisexuality is far more than hinted at) and of poor Jolie as his mysterious beautiful mother Olympias busily flaring her nostrils and feeding Alexanders Oedipal complex. Shes depicted as a Medusa-like snake charmer complete with serpent-like tendrils of hair who some called a sorceress. Stone makes sure that were clear on what we should think of her by interspersing one of her speeches with footage of Alexanders wedding night to Roxane (Rosario Dawson sneering all her lines). (That wedding night by the way is one of cinemas odder sex scenes with the two of them hissing at each other like cats.) On goes the story as Alexander racks up more conquests on the battlefield and in the bedroom and the filmmaking starts to become increasingly more desperate with an odd flashback-within-a-flashback and a sudden battlefield scene in which everything is red as if the movie started bleeding. And his dramatic deathbed scene comes far too late -- ""Alexander"" the movie dies long before Alexander the man and weve already ceased to care about his impact. Comparisons with Wolfgang Petersens ""Troy"" this years other ancient-Greek-warrior epic are inevitable and frankly neither movie seems likely to be cherished by future generations. But the main difference is that ""Troy"" though flawed gave some actors room to craft characters and show off their chops Peter OToole in particular nimbly stole the movie. ""Alexander"" by contrast begs to be stolen but nobody steps up. Theres a recurring theme in Stones film of an eagle soaring into the sun over the battlefields suddenly appearing and then flying away. Would that he had the movie with him.

"Oliver Stones lame Alexander. Slate Sign In Sign Up Oliver Stones lame Alexander. Oliver Stones lame Alexander. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 24 2004 948 AM Olivers Army In Alexander Stone makes a mess of Mesopotamia. By David Edelstein Despot he may be but hes still Mamas boy With Alexander (Warner Bros.) Oliver Stone has done what I never thought possible He has made me feel pity for him. The movie is a sprawling mess a lox a three-hour non-starter. But its not an affront like Stones other bombastic amphetamine-paced essays in megalomania. This one large-scaled as it is seems too puny and fragmented for its mighty subject; it feels as if Stone for the first time in his career simply ran out of hot air. Please understand the source of my vitriol I consider Stones Natural Born Killers to be hands down the worst movie ever made--and not the worst in the manner of Ed Woods Plan 9 From Outer Space. I mean the worst in its combination of aesthetic and moral ugliness in the way it bombards you into accepting the idea that a pair of serial mass murderers could be enlightened hipsters. (The original script by Quentin Tarantino was a heavy-handed but amusing satire of sensationalistic media; by the time Stone had gotten through with it the serial killers had evolved into existential heroes.) Advertisement Now Stone attempts to tell the story of another mass murderer/existential hero Alexander the Great (played by Colin Farrell) the young Macedonian king who in 323 B.C. swept through Greece and then the Persian Empire--what is now Egypt Syria Iran and Iraq--and then more foolishly into India a dozen years of conquests that at the very least touched the lives of more people on the planet than any military leader before him (even if only to end them). How does Stone feel about this titanic force of history? Slightly ambivalent but on the whole pretty darn positive. Yes there are all those natives and disloyalists he massacred--but isnt that a small price to pay for greatness? And if his men didnt always see the logic of his dream to spread Hellenic civilization to people who didnt care to have it well maybe thats because they werent fellow eagles They couldnt soar above nation-state borders and see them as illusory to be transcended by his own titanic will. Which is not to say that Alexander wasnt from time to time a force for good. He was a pretty empathetic despot when he stayed put and he certainly educated people in the omnipresent threat of conquering armies. I could continue in this on-the-one-hand/on-the-other vein for the length of Alexander but the bottom line is that there is no bottom line Concluding that Alexanders failures were more estimable than other mens successes this is an unusually straddling sort of effort for Stone. Is it possible that his loathing for what he regards as doomed U.S. imperialism in present-day Persia has muffled his reliably fascist storytelling instincts? He seems to have forgotten how to put an audience on the rack. The picture is narrated by Anthony Hopkins as the aged general Ptolemy Hes dictating his memoirs for posterity and he cant quite get a handle on his protagonist. Neither for that matter can Stone and his co-screenwriters Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogris. Apart from a tendency to view Macedonians and Greeks as one people the film is more or less historically accurate--aided and abetted by the Oxford scholar Robin Lane Fox who has no doubt disgraced himself among his colleagues by penning a ""making of"" book. Foxs advice clearly wasnt dramaturgical Theres a huge narrative leap from the young Alexander having a public spat with his drunken one-eyed father Philip (Val Kilmer) to Alexander leading 40000 men against 250000 Persians at the Battle of Gaugamela. Late in the movie Stone doubles back and fills in some of the gaps (with a soupcon of Freud or at least Oedipus) but by then the dire storytelling tin-eared dialogue and swollen running time have dulled our curiosity. Advertisement Much is made of Alexanders tactical genius in overcoming long odds but Stone has no similar gift. Despite the eagles-eye view of battle--and I mean folks the literal eagles-eye view owing to Alexanders spiritual bond with a ubiquitous bird of prey--its impossible to tell where one army is in relation to another or just how Alexander gets the best of his impassive Persian counterpart. Alexander is packed with hundreds of thousands of warriors wielding long spears with kinetic body smashings and face smushings with intricately choreographed mano-a-mano stabbings and furious horse- camel- and elephant-back riding but the editors must have had a stroke trying to make it all flow together. Listening to Alexander appeal to his exhausted irritable army to continue on to the heart of Asia instead of heading back to Babylon or Macedonia you find yourself fearing not for his men but for Colin Farrells vocal cords which sound as if theyre being shredded to a powder. Farrell had a stylish bully-boy presence in Daredevil and in a terrific Irish ensemble movie called Intermission. At his best hes shrewdly small-scale. You can imagine him firing up the lads at the pub before he gets too stuporous. But all the armies of the Western world? He doesnt begin to have the stature--or the lung power. And those pouffy blond locks dont help. Quite a bit has been written about Stones inclusion of Alexanders (historically accurate) bisexuality. The point seems to be that Alexander knew no boundaries--that his sexuality was as fluid as his notion of geographical borders. But its tame stuff moist looks traded with a eunuch and with Jared Leto--an actor with bright blue eyes whos too self-intoxicated to be much of an erotic force. Despite a role that has no dramatic arc (Philip rejects and embraces Alexander according to the demands of the plot) Kilmer is big and fearless enough to bluster through in entertaining style. But the only truly heroic presence in the picture is Angelina Jolie improbably but delightfully cast as Alexanders imperious mother Olympias. Jolie slits her eyes and toys with her lines controlling the space without raising her voice. I dont care how nuts she is Jolie is the real deal a gorgeous epic-scaled actress who can transform herself from the inside out. She could eat Colin Farrell for breakfast and pick her teeth with Jared Leto. Forget Alexander The film is a pedestal to Angelina the great. Greek to Me Many readers (some of them Greek some classics scholars) dispute the line above that Alexander muddles Macedonians with Greeks pointing out that Hellenic culture and myth--both of which were regularly invoked by Alexander--are Greek and not Macedonian legacies. I admit that I was swayed by a heated letter (sent to many critics evidently) from an indignant Macedonian. I shall leave Greeks (who have suggested Ive committed a blood libel) Macedonians scholars and other interested parties to fight it out in the Fray.

Starring Colin Farrell Angelina Jolie Val Kilmer and Jared Leto. Directed by Oliver Stone. (R. 173 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Alexander"" Oliver Stones three-hour screen biography of Alexander the Great is epic in scale but not epic in spirit a wallow in carnage that fails to demonstrate what was so great about this conqueror after all. It intersperses scenes of slaughter with scenes of Alexander either exhorting his troops to kill yet more people or sulking because hes misunderstood. It becomes monotonous. When its 2300 years ago one battle looks pretty much the same as the next. Only one thing could have held ""Alexander"" together and thats a strong personality at its center. Certainly the historical Alexander offered the possibility of a protagonist as ruthless charming and megalomaniacal as George S. Patton but the movie apparently chose another direction a fairly ho-hum one As played by Colin Farrell Alexander is just a brave and particularly gifted young man with a noble vision. In other words Stone tries to make us like Alexander because hes good when he should have made us want to watch Alexander because hes amazing. The script is full of lukewarm choices. For example Alexander has a difficult relationship with his drunken father King Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer). So how does Alexander feel about him? Is he fanatically loyal to him and blind to his failings? Or does he absolutely hate the old mans guts? Neither. Hes just sort of ambivalent. Dad has a drinking problem. Its hard. The irony is that by making Alexander the equivalent of a sensitive modern man the movie has the effect of making him less sympathetic because it invites us to judge him according to a modern standard. It might have been fascinating to watch some dynamo from ancient times laying waste to the known world if we got to see the frenzied zeal and the blood in his eyes. But to have to accept such a person as a basically nice guy makes us pull back. By modern standards Alexander is just a mass murderer the first of a long line of tyrants including Napoleon who killed people allegedly for their own good. The opening is strong enough to make audiences optimistic. Anthony Hopkins leads things off as Ptolemy remembering Alexander for a history hes writing many years after Alexanders death. He describes his former general as a colossus thus setting a high standard for the film. Scenes from Alexanders childhood present a background that could either make or break him. His sexy slithery mother Olympias -- played by Angelina Jolie with a Russian accent -- is a master of court intrigue pinning all her hopes on her son while his father is a capricious lout who could easily disown him. Theres a strong scene in which the young Alexander (Connor Paolo) finally gains his fathers respect by riding a horse everyone believed couldnt be tamed. But once Colin Farrell assumes the role wearing a fluffy blond wig things take a wrong turn. He looks confused fuzzy around the eyes. This is not the incisive Alexander who untied the Gordian knot by cutting it with his sword. This is a fellow whod look more at home on the cover of Tiger Beat magazine. Most of what follows are battle scenes or preludes to battle scenes. Stone is skillful. He shows the hand-to-hand combat but he also pulls back to give us the overall picture and make us understand the strategy at work. But with no compelling Alexander either to pull for or be amazed by the audience really has no horse -- or llama or elephant -- in this race. Much has already been made of the fact that in Alexander modern cinema gets its first gay action hero. In fact Alexanders relationship with his friend and lover Hephaistion is treated with some ambiguity -- lots of hugs no kisses. Its also interesting that while the historical Hephaistion was actually bigger and older than Alexander here hes played by Jared Leto whos younger and smaller with long auburn hair parted in the middle. Presumably the idea is if Alexander must have a boyfriend at least give him one as pretty as Diane Lane. In between hugging Hephaistion Alexander finds time to marry an Indian woman Roxane played by Rosario Dawson. This leads to a hilarious wedding-night sequence which begins with Roxane walking in on Hephaistion and Alexander and asking her new husband ""You luff heem?"" The more people Alexander kills the longer and fluffier Farrells wigs get. At times Farrell is so unconvincing as a hero that one wonders if ""Alexander"" is some veiled hatchet job by Stone who after all has made some notable anti-war movies. But no. Every time Alexander talks about ""freeing the people of the world"" -- freeing them from being alive? -- the soundtrack pitches in with inspiring music. ""Alexander"" is not hatchet job. It just doesnt make its case. -- Advisory This movie contains sexual situations nudity and graphic violence.

Early on in Oliver Stones new film biography there is a scene in which the adolescent Alexander accompanies his father Philip of Macedonia (Val Kilmer essaying a regal sense of exhaustion) into a darkened cave decorated with images inspired by Greek mythology. On one wall loom proud Achilles and mighty Prometheus on another King Oedipus. The point being that the great (and flawed) men of one generation cant help comparing themselves to -- and attempting to surpass -- their predecessors. Which for the men of Alexanders time meant vying for a place in history with those who had been touched by the gods themselves.In other words be careful what you wish for.Its familiar territory for Stone much of whose career has been spent making cinematic cave paintings about men of his own era who aspired to godhead from Jim Morrison and Richard Nixon to megalomaniacal 1980s stockbrokers and the testosterone-inflated supermen of the National Football League. So it comes as little surprise to learn that Stone has been trying to mount a film about Alexander the Great since long before he afforded the warrior king a cameo appearance in 1991s The Doors. Thirteen years 150 million and one contentious headline-grabbing production later Alexander seems to have defeated its maker in a way that Alexander himself never was on the battlefield. In tracing the young conquerors life from infancy to his death (from typhoid or malarial fever) four months shy of his 33rd birthday Stone is unfailingly serious in his approach adhering scrupulously to historical fact and immersing himself in the political landscape of the time (356-323 B.C.). Yet at the end of the day -- or at least of the films three hours -- he has given us an Alexander entirely and fatally lacking in greatness a hollow triumph of intellect over feeling. What surprises most is how little of Stones own raging rambunctious ambition has made it onto the screen. For surely if Stone were destined to botch Alexander he could at least be relied upon to do so in a gaudy grandiloquent fashion reminiscent of the more outre passages in Natural Born Killers and Nixon. (And how difficult could such a feat have been once Stone had cast two of Alexanders principal roles with those nonpareil Tinseltown eccentrics Kilmer and Angelina Jolie?) What Stone has delivered instead is no folie de grandeur but rather the last thing one would have expected from him an honorable failure.

Working from his own screenplay (co-written by Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis with generous input from historian Robin Lane Fox) Stone is hardly unaware of the contemporary resonances of a story in which a power-crazed despot employs rhetoric about uniting the world as a means by which to conquer it. (To drive the point home Stone has even depicted Alexanders chief antagonist the Persian king Darius with a long tan face and straggly beard that seem to have been lifted from the bin Laden gene pool.) As has already been widely reported Stone has also approached Alexanders famed bisexuality with an openness and lack of sensationalism that while not exactly radical by the standards of say Derek Jarmans Sebastiane is certainly the closest a major-studio feature has come to advocating for gays in the military. And though he lacks the larger-than-life force of personality that the role demands Colin Farrell gives of himself fully to Alexander softening his voice and his eyes in a way that evokes the boy striving to become a man. Meanwhile wreathed in live snakes that are sure to be the envy of most men in the audience Jolie embodies Alexanders domineering mother Olympias with a hissing intensity that is by far the liveliest thing in the movie. You dont doubt for a second that she swallows her prey whole.For almost as long as there have been recorded histories of Alexander the Great historians have struggled to reckon their subjects evident magnanimity with his equally apparent bloodlust. Hence one of Alexanders earliest chroniclers the 1st century A.D. biographer Plutarch allowed his own Hellenistic pride to lead him to manufacture defenses for what would today be considered among Alexanders most indefensible actions. But for all his diligent research and analysis Stone ultimately seems not just unresolved in his feelings about Alexander but downright noncommittal. Thats not to say that Stone should be forced to choose between Alexander the lover-dreamer and Alexander the brute -- indeed it makes for a more interesting film that he doesnt. Rather its to say that while Stone tells us a great many things about who Alexander was and what he accomplished he does so largely from the outside in leaving us with precious little sense of the inner forces demonic or otherwise that drove Alexander to conquer most of the known world by the age of 25. That wonderful early scene in the cave notwithstanding Alexander scarcely brings us closer to its subject than do the marbleized busts one finds in museum exhibitions.Of course the same could easily be said of the treatment Ray and Finding Neverland afford their subjects and while Alexander is doubtless the best of the three its also the one that has the highest standard to live up to -- Stones own. In his earlier biopics particularly JFK and Nixon Stone employed multiple film stocks and some dazzling feats of picture and sound editing to achieve a remarkable sense of multiple simultaneously occurring realities -- the world as viewed by his subject and his subject as viewed by the world around him. And he populated the edges of those stories with armies of supporting characters -- some based on real people others freely invented -- so vivid that they frequently threatened to usurp the very figures they were supposedly supporting. (Think Tommy Lee Jones in JFK or Bob Hoskins in Nixon.) Those movies were compulsively watchable even or especially when the ideas they were espousing were at their looniest. By comparison Alexander -- in its imagery and its ideology -- doesnt just feel restrained it feels anesthetized. Its the first of Stones films that craves respectability and the only one that makes you wish Baz Luhrmann had directed it instead. Respectable as it may be Alexander is also a thudding bore when what it should have been is an operatic testament to unchecked ambition -- Stones Aguirre or his Fitzcarraldo. In a particularly perverse gesture the first battle scene doesnt come until nearly one-third of the way through the picture when an outnumbered Alexander brazenly descends on Darius at Guagamela. And while as battle scenes go this is a pretty good one with a potent sense of real human bone and sinew that was missing from the big set pieces of Troy its scarcely adequate compensation for soldiering through the rest of Alexander. The borderline-incestuous mother love between Alexander and Olympias; the tender comradeship between Alexander and his soul mate Hephaistion (well-played by an eye-shadowy Jared Leto); the strategic marriage of Alexander to his barbarian wife Roxane (Rosario Dawson) -- Stone gets to the marrow of none of these. Only very late in the films third hour during an elaborate (and admittedly spectacular) re-creation of Alexanders battle against the pachyderm-led forces of the Indian king Porus does Stone seem to snap awake from his slumber to assert his authorship of the film. After a breathtaking succession of towering spears being crushed like toothpicks and human bodies flung about by elephant tusks we arrive at that majestic shot of Alexanders horse Bucephalus rearing on its hind legs to confront a similarly positioned elephant. When Alexander is wounded by an arrow piercing his armor the images onscreen go red as though the film stock had been developed in a solution of Alexanders own blood. And so Alexander sparks to life mere screen minutes before its eponymous hero swallows his last breath.

Alexander Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/alexander-2004,200,alexander16,alexander,rogerebert
"Stones Alexander turns out not so great - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Stones Alexander turns out not so great As hero Farrell cant stand up to unruly plot By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  November 24 2004 The new Oliver Stone movie Alexander"" is full of brilliant highlights and theyre all in Colin Farrells hair.His coif begins a mere flaxen mop full of life (and sand) as he smolders through the young-adult years of Alexander the Great. Nearly three hours (and 13 years) later its gone wild turned into the mane of both a warrior and certain Camaro owners.In those salon-treated locks you can see the movie that Alexander"" is -- long and unruly -- and the one that it longs to be layered and unforgettable.A historical epic is what a director makes when he wants to matter again a globe-trotting sword-and-sandal spectacular that has everything from small nations of extras to bellicose pachyderms on the payroll.Lord knows Stone spent enough of his life to make this one happen -- decades by his count.Now that Alexander"" is finally here the best there is to say is that its better than Troy.""The movies most assured moments are the wars but those could have been filmed by anyone. War was personal and terrifying to Stone in Platoon"" and Born on the Fourth of July"" but its often generic in Alexander."" If weve seen one sequence in which anonymous soldiers are impaled by zooming arrows Im afraid weve seen them all.A wise old Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) dictates Alexanders life to us. Regally robed shuffling speaking with a scratchy voice Hopkins is the movies Yoda.In his youth Ptolemy was one of Alexanders soldiers and advisers and he tells how a series of assassinations made Alexander king at 19. By the time he died at 32 in 323 BC Alexander had expanded his empire from the Mediterranean to the Middle East to India. (Alexandrias pop up everywhere on the map like parking lots or Starbucks.)Stone and fellow screenwriters Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis cover all the bases taking liberties with both ancient history and the life of his nation-plundering Macedonian general. The films lessons could be slipped inside a fortune cookie. (Never"" for instance confuse feelings with duties"" Alexander is told.) The combat sequences are grueling. The photography is buttery. The betrayals are many the hard-core loyalists few the tan lines ubiquitous and the hero himself gay. I think. Some of the trouble with Alexander"" is that Stone has Farrells ambitious conqueror caught up in so much intrigue on the battlefield and in the boudoir that the director doesnt seem to know what to make of him. Farrell for his part makes a serviceable icon. Hes fiery and gentle and above all physically and emotionally athletic. But Alexander is pulled in so many directions that both Farrells performance and the character are stretched thin. Alexander amassed many allies even more acquaintances a few friends and according to this movie only one true love. His name is Hephaistion and as played by the distressingly passive Jared Leto its hard to tell whether hes made of flesh or styrofoam. But in squishy conversations that amount to Alexanders pledging his eternal devotion to his boyhood chum and fellow warrior were meant to be certain that the king is crazy about this guy.Alexander may give his heart to Hephaistion but Stone doesnt seem comfortable allowing the friends to become lovers. Alexander does bed the dancing Persian eunuch Bagoas (Francisco Bosch) which feels like a consolation prize. Our king can have sex with a man -- sorry man"" -- as long as its not the one he loves. The nervous handling of the important relationship lays an absurd emotional dead spot over the pictures overblown finale.Somewhere near the halfway point Alexander finally takes a bride the comely Persian Roxane (Rosario Dawson). Its a decision that appalls his fellow Macedonians (politically speaking hes throwing away his legacy) and wreaks havoc on his peace of mind. Shes jealous of Hephaistion which seems fair with the underwhelming Dawson in the part Why cant she be the only mannequin in Alexanders life? After years of marriage their failure to spawn an heir to the kingdom leaves her bitter and vindictive. But Stone has no interest in the soap opera on the movies surface or the melodrama just below. The ingredients for camp are all over the place but the director is determined to take his material seriously. Thats a Herculean challenge as you watch Angelina Jolie slither through the movie as Alexanders scorned mother Olympias. She programs him from birth to succeed and outdo his father King Philip (Val Kilmer). Dad supplies counter-programming informing his son (played in boyhood by Connor Paolo) to beware of women. Theyre more dangerous than men.""And where Kilmer is a drunken riot Jolie is plenty dangerous. Her Greco-Gabor accent alone could kill. But while she is the movies scapegoat she is also the only person in Alexander"" about whom Stone seems to have unequivocal feelings The lady is diabolical. Leaving no analogy unused she even turns up as Medusa. Thats reductive and unfair but at least she stands for something.Its harder to know what to make of the incongruous political allegory the filmmakers intend. Alexander is a man who cant stop conquering. Hes indifferent to his weary troops pleas to return to Macedonia and the folks hes conquered are resentful. The reason according to the movie He wants a longer resum than his fathers.In building a great global empire Alexander turns megalomaniacal imperialist and unheeding. If this is all starting to sound a little too Bushy for comfort that appears to be what Stone wants.But Stone himself calls to mind fellow Vietnam veteran John Kerry in his own lack of clarity about war. Is Stone for or against it? Suffering aside the combat sequences have an almost pornographic pull.Like his libidinous hero the director tries to have it both ways. As a result Alexander"" may be the first of its kind a sword-and-flip-flop movie.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Perhaps this singular historical figure and his epic journey defy definitive characterization. Oliver Stone has taken the challenge of disproving this suspicion very seriously but his ""Alexander"" is at best an honorable failure. Unlike his boyhood hero Achilles Alexander the Great did not have a major poet or dramatist to immortalize his extraordinary story. Although much is known about the Macedonian king who conquered a considerable part of the known world 2300 years ago before dying at age 32 perhaps this singular historical figure and his epic journey defy definitive characterization. Oliver Stone has taken the challenge of disproving this suspicion very seriously but his enormous ""Alexander"" is at best an honorable failure an intelligent and ambitious picture that crucially lacks dramatic flair and emotional involvement. Dry and academic where ""Troy"" was vulgar and willfully ahistorical this Warner Bros. release the campaign for which doesnt begin to suggest pics scope will have a tough time at the B.O. domestically although like ""Troy"" and ""King Arthur"" should play better overseas. Far more than most epics and more than some of Stones contemporary films such as ""JFK"" ""Alexander"" endeavors to be historically and culturally correct as well as to keep its weighty themes in sharp focus. Pic is keen to posit Alexander as a visionary who instead of punishing and destroying the civilizations he defeated embraced them in an attempt to unite East and West; in Stones view he may have been the first One World proponent. Startling visions of antiquity the likes of which have never before been put on the screen will surely stay in the mind long after the dramatic vicissitudes have been forgotten Alexander outwitting a much larger Persian army at Gaugamela the legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon horses panicking at the sight of marauding war elephants in the forests of India. But much of the nearly three-hour running time is devoted to knotty personal and geopolitical issues that most viewers wont give a hoot about a problem not alleviated by the stirring old-fashioned Hollywood storytelling know-how that used to sweep audiences into all manner of historical material. Beginning with a nod to ""Citizen Kane"" in 323 B.C. with the great mans death of fever in Babylon pic flashes forward 40 years to his lone surviving colleague the aged Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) surveying the spectacular harbor of Alexandria. Ptolemys admiring remarks provide a primer to untutored viewers as to his old friends importance (""No tyrant ever gave back so much"" ""In his presence we were better than ourselves"") but as they persist periodically throughout the film the commentaries parch the drama with the air of musty school books. Narrative then jumps back to Alexanders childhood as the son of the estranged king and queen of Macedonia Philip (Val Kilmer) and Olympias (Angelina Jolie). The former provides his son with an imposing and intimidating role model via his successful empire building while the latter fuels the boy with an ever-growing Oedipus complex. Talk about privilege Being prince of this realm includes being tutored by Aristotle (Christopher Plummer) who instills Alexander with lofty ideals and a love of learning as well as with the racially prejudiced belief that the Greeks are a race superior to the ""barbarians"" of Asia a widely held idea Alexander came to repudiate over time. Scenes of the beautiful classmates studying al fresco and wrestling lay in an appropriatehomoerotic subtext particularly between Alexander and his closest friend Hephaistion. Even more significant as foreshadowing is a fine scene in which King Philip gives his son a tour of cave paintings depicting gruesome moments in Greek myth and history. Early stretch is greatly boosted by the precocious performance as young Alexander by Connor Paolo who has graceful self-assurance and a striking resemblance to Colin Farrell. After a now-grown-up Alexander (Farrell) arrives on the scene just in time to be exiled along with his mother from Macedonia the script by Stone Christopher Kyle (""K19 The Widowmaker"") and Laeta Kalogridis leapfrogs over gobs of conflict and history to 331 B.C. with Alexanders army ready to take on the Persian King Darius in a battle that will significantly alter the history of the world. The detail is impressive; Alexanders rejection of his generals caution Alexanders inspiring words to his men about how they are free men fighting an army of slaves the scrupulous attention to the mechanics of war. The 12-minute battle itself is overwhelming as logistically clarifying overhead shots mix with fast-moving camerawork through thick sand and sun to convey confusion and the decisive maneuverability of Alexanders forces at Gaugamela. Arresting also is Alexanders triumphant entry through the giant portals of Babylon the throbbing heart of the ancient world that is extravagantly evoked by production designer Jan Roelfs and a vast artistic team. As the victors relax Alexander and Hephaistion (Jared Leto wearing disconcerting eyeliner throughout) reaffirm their multi-faceted lifelong bond. One of the vexing dilemmas in dramatizing Alexanders campaigns is how to give weight to the fact he covered some 10000 miles and fought roughly 70 battles (never losing) over the course of 12 years while also trying to distill his political career and aspects of his mysterious inner self. Its possibly a no-win challenge (Robert Rossens 1956 ""Alexander the Great"" the only previous film bio didnt manage it too well) and Stone has set himself up as an easy target for those quick to ridicule risky artistic ambition. Still the filmmaker passes over a section of the story where he might have gotten audiences at least somewhat into Alexanders head during the young monarchs consolidation of power and setting of ambition. Instead there is excessive churning on his murky relations with his mother. Matters arent greatly helped by a dragon lady performance by Jolie unaccountably enunciated in a Continental accent that sounds like a combination of Mata Hari and Count Dracula. Taking his cue from Farrell however Stone made the inspired decision to give all the Macedonians including Kilmers Philip light Irish accents which contrast with the British intonations of the Greeks; the condescending view of the classical Athenians toward their rougher less distinguished northern rivals perfectly mirrors traditional English attitudes toward the Irish. As Alexander pushes on to Northeastern Persia in pursuit of the elusive Darius to the Hindu Kush in the shadows of the Himalayas and finally into India in search of ""the end of the world"" there are intimations of an inchoate Utopianism on the conquerors part -- his adoption of local modes of dress marriage to the dark-skinned Eastern woman Roxane (Rosario Dawson in a sexually claws-out perf) -- that dismay his inner circle. There are also political observations with quiet reverberations. ""Babylon was a far easier place to enter than it was to leave"" Ptolemy retrospectively opines. Of the Persians Alexander says ""These people want...NEED change."" Although vigorous the film seems oddly anonymous much of the time as if the projects ambition and the epic form itself somehow induced Stone to put the brakes on his customary formal experimentation and audacity. Only in the sickening final battle in the thick of India is he inspired to employ some of the subjective altered-state stylization at which he excels the visceral effect of which suggests the intensity and otherworldly wildness that the film could have used more of. Decked out in lightened hair and a determined demeanor Farrell seems set to seize the day both as an actor and as Alexander. But while his vigorous readings capably register the lines meanings and emotions there is a lack of exalted greatness -- the sense of a man apart -- that would make the film special and convincing the sort of fit of thesp to role both necessary and rare such as Peter OToole as Lawrence and George C. Scott as Patton. Ironically given the long running time Alexanders close colleagues arent given enough to do to pop out of the costumed background ; even Hephaistion and young Ptolemy the latter of whom lives to tell the tale remain one-dimensional. Dawsons hellcat wife also seems unduly sidelined. Enormous effort has gone into imagining the look of Alexanders ever-expanding empire from the decor of the buildings to weapons and jewelry design for which Roelfs and costumer Jenny Beavan and their teams deserve high marks. Careful CGI work usefully amplifies the grandeur of the Gaugamela battle Babylon and Alexandria augmenting shooting done in Morocco northern Thailand and London studios. Lenser Rodrigo Prietos images however dont carry the weight and richness one hopes for in large format epic cinema as they tend toward a slightly overexposed bleached quality. At first Vangelis score shows a tendency to smother scenes to anti-dramatic effect but it gradually builds in character to enhance and ennoble an enterprise that attempts a great deal and despite the best intentions falls a good deal short.

But Oliver Stone is alpha male incarnate and his pictures from Platoon to JFK to Any Given Sunday are celebrations and autopsies of overweening machismo. Alexander his first fiction film in five years promises plenty more of the same. Instead of a stately epic -- like Robert Rossens 1956 Alexander the Great with Richard Burton as the globe-annexing god-king -- Stone presents a riot of sensations military and erotic through which Alexander (Colin Farrell) has to hack like an intrepid soldier through an unfamiliar jungle. All of which makes for a long lumpy trip with a charismatic guide and some brilliant detours. The script follows what is known about Alexander who left the Ionian peninsula to sweep the fabled Babylon and India into his ambitious embrace. But Stone who wrote the film with Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis sees the old Greek fables as horror stories Olympus as Hades and the Macedonian royal family -- led by one-eyed Philip (Val Kilmer) and his spiteful bride Olympias (Angelina Jolie)--drowning in lust and supernal rancor. In this realm the king is the last man conscious at an orgy just as Stone is still drunk on the pricey preposterous adventure of moviemaking. And at 58 hes still standing.

But the new movie has plenty of contemporary reverberations. This Alexander is a clear model for George W. Bush pursuing destiny or delusion from the civilized West into Babylon-Baghdad completing the quest George H.W. Bush left unfinished. Warned that this ""was not your fathers mission"" the young king replies ""And I am not my father."" Or Alexander could be Stone -- a crafty-crazy visionary who legendarily drives himself his crew and his films through chaos and into creativity. In this shadow autobiography Alexanders India is Stones Vietnam the land where he fought in the infantry and the subject of so many of his films. In the battle scenes in India trained elephants materialize as if in a Nam soldiers dope dream and the screen goes red. At this moment of hallucinogenic hyperdrama the camera almost literally has blood in its eye. The hole in the center of this mythic history is Farrell who looks overwhelmed and diminished by the burden of carrying an epic movie on his bulked-up shoulders. Jolie however is right at home as his mother. A sorceress lolling among snakes -- the sexiest Gorgon whose stare melts the screen -- she spits out seductive invectives in a crypto-Carpathian accent; Olympias may be Philips wife but she is Draculas daughter. And Jolie inhabits her with an awful grandeur. The archetypal housewife furious at her husbands philandering she tells Philip ""In my womb I carried my avenger."" Jolies real vengeance is to invade the films story and conquer it. This mans movie is a womans triumph after all.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Coming Attractions Colin Farrell Oliver Stone or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- Oliver Stones sweeping epic ""Alexander"" is a beautifully wrapped package but open it up and theres nothing there.This much ballyhooed and long-awaited historical drama starring Colin Farrell as one of the worlds greatest warriors Alexander the Great could have been titled ""Alexander the Dud.""When Stone an Academy Award-winning writer and director is good -- with films such as ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Platoon"" -- he is very very good.But when hes bad as he has been with movies such as ""Nixon"" and ""Any Given Sunday"" its painfully obvious. To be fair Stones artistic aim is always extremely high but when he misses he misses big.Of course this 2000-year-old story about a man who conquered 90 percent of the known world by the age of 25 is daunting in scope. Stone along with screenwriters Christopher Kyle and Laeta Kalogridis was faced with a truly Herculean task.In an effort to fill in the many plot gaps they use Anthony Hopkins playing Alexanders trusted general Ptolemy as narrator. Forty years after Alexanders death Ptolemy -- now the elderly Pharaoh of Egypt -- relates the life story of his king to a scribe at the legendary library in Alexandria.Unfortunately when you have voice-over and flashback carrying this much of the basic narrative it usually means trouble with the script.Sometimes it works -- ""Stand by Me"" is a case in point. But here it takes away from the audiences attachment to the main character and fragments his emotional journey. The final product is a ponderous death march of a story that seemingly never ends.Ptolemy begins his tale when Alexander is a young boy overly attached to his beautiful and manipulative mother Queen Olympias played by Angelina Jolie. Hes constantly used as a pawn in an ongoing struggle between his mother and his father King Philip II of Macedonia played by Val Kilmer.This kid has major mother issues -- Doctor Phil would have a field day -- and the embarrassingly clunky dialogue doesnt help. At one point Olympias turns to Alexander and pouts ""What have I done to make you hate me so? Everything Ive done Ive done for you"" This is the stuff of soap operas not Greek tragedy. Both Jolie and Kilmer are woefully miscast -- throw in the trite dialogue and -- Houston we have a problem.One positive note the young actor chosen to play Alexander during his teenage years 13-year-old Connor Paolo is a dead ringer for Farrell and the only piece of casting that really works.One battle sequence after anotherFinally Alexander grows up and begins conquering the world but the movie doesnt improve. The unending battle scenes while chaotic and bloody have no point of view and its impossible to know who is who. Eventually you just stop caring. Again you lose connection with your main character.There has been much speculation as to how Stone would deal with Alexanders sexuality and his love for his lifelong friend Hephaistion played by Jared Leto. For the most part Stone handles this issue very straightforwardly (pardon the pun). In the ancient Hellenic world before the rise of Christianity contemporary definitions regarding homosexuality or bisexuality were meaningless.The two ""love"" scenes between Alexander and Hephaistion are strictly verbal and nothing physical occurs. This is probably for the best. Anything graphic would surely have made a great portion of the audience feel uncomfortable and thereby have taken them out of the moment. There are plenty of other mentions of the sexual attitudes of that time period to make the point.Another problem is Farrells hair. Sorry I have to go there.According to history books Alexander the Great was a blond; Richard Burton dyed his locks for the 1956 production of the story. But Farrells naturally dark hair was transformed into a cheap glaring bottle blond while leaving the Irish actors black caterpillar-like eyebrows their normal color.This may be nitpicking -- but for me -- the jarring result is that Farrells Alexander looks like a Babylonian hooker after a busy Saturday night. The bad dye job also greatly hinders this talented actor from ever achieving the enormous authority needed to carry off this gigantic role.For the most part this film while visually stunning is really just one battle sequence after another. Many scenes such as the march into Babylon are breathtaking. The script however is totally pedestrian the casting inept and the results are disappointing.I found myself desperately glancing at my watch more than once.In the end the only thing that kept me going was the blessed knowledge that Alexander died at the relatively young age of 32. Therefore I assumed the movie couldnt possibly go on forever.Although it certainly felt that way at times.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

"Alexander | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; alexander ) Alexander (United States/United Kingdom/Germany/Netherlands 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli To sum up Alexander in three words I would choose the following three-hour miscalculation. Although some aspects of Oliver Stones sword-and-sandals epic are worthy of mention (and even praise) they are dwarfed by the missteps and examples of bad judgment. Instead of delivering a mainstream tale of battle and glory along the lines of Gladiator Stone decided to re-imagine the great Alexander as a Hamlet-like figure. Rather than developing the title character as a larger-than-life individual whose flaws give him a more rounded personality Stone turns Alexander into a character who is defined by those flaws. He is weak indecisive plagued by self-doubt and obsessed. Its not credible that a man of this nature could conquer 90% of the known world by the age of 32 and therein lies Alexanders conundrum. By de-mythologizing Alexander Stone has turned him into an unbelievable individual. We accept great deeds from great people not from sniveling whiners. Even though Alexander runs three hours it can depict only highlights of the characters life. A full chronology of the kings exploits would demand a mini-series of at least three or four times that length. Whats strange about Alexander is the incidents that Stone chooses to highlight. A key episode - the death of Alexanders father - is skipped only to be shown later via an ill-placed flashback. The battles that comprise much of Alexanders adult life are largely ignored. Two are shown (the defining conflict of Gaugamela in which the Greeks overcome a significantly superior Persian force and a skirmish in the forests of India) but many are mentioned only in passing by the narrator. Instead the film concentrates on more mundane elements Alexanders stormy relationships with his mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie) father Philip (Val Kilmer) and wife Roxane (Rosario Dawson); his deep friendship with his inseparable companion Hephaestion (Jared Leto); and his attempts to balance his obsessive need to ""go further"" with the growing desire of his commanders to return home. The more land Alexander conquers the more restless his forces become. Since Alexander doesnt have a villain Stone allows the characters inner demons to fill the part. An alternative - placing Darius (Raz Degan) the king of Persia - into that role is rejected. This lends an anticlimactic quality to the battle of Gaugamela and the subsequent ""hunt"" for Darius (who escapes). The Hollywood formula would have Alexander killing him in single combat; Stone has other ideas. Its unfair to place the failure of the central character exclusively on Colin Farrell. Farrell is not the best choice for the part - his roguish rough-and-tumble approach isnt well-suited to playing a heroic type and his version of the Greek king lacks both presence and charisma. But the script doesnt demand those qualities. Stone wants someone who is closer to Hamlet than Achilles and one could argue that Farrell fits those parameters. But this interpretation of Alexander is not going to work for a lot of viewers (myself included) and when a movies main character fails to connect with the audience theres a problem. Stone arrives at an interesting way to ""hide"" Farrells Irish accent. Instead of requiring the actor to disguise it the director forces every other performer essaying a Greek or Macedonian role to have an Irish brogue. This becomes distracting. Then theres Angelina Jolie whose Russian (?) sounds cartoonish at times. I dont know how well legitimate Greek accents would have come across but its hard to imagine them being as off-putting. Alexander is ripe with homoerotic images and incestuous overtones. Although no graphic male-male sex is depicted theres plenty of innuendo and those who are uncomfortable with homosexuality will be offended by parts of Alexander. This may be the most expensive motion picture to-date in which the bisexuality of the main character is so openly acknowledged. (Alexander actually represents the king as a gay man who tarries with women primarily for procreative purposes.) The lone male-female sex scene is presented more as a struggle for control than a loving encounter. When it comes to tenderness Alexander reserves that emotion for his male companion Hephaestion. Second billing after Farrell goes to Angelina Jolie who plays Olympias as a hybrid of Hamlets Gertrude and I Claudius Livia. Jolie keeps her clothes on but that doesnt prevent her from spending a lot of time cuddling with snakes. Its a weird enjoyably over-the-top performance. Im tempted to say that Rosario Dawson is underused but the sex scene which offers us a lingering view of all of her assets argues against that statement (and is almost reason enough to pay for admission). Still almost anyone with a great body could have played the part. Val Kilmer is fine as Philip the one-eyed king and Jared Leto is subdued as Alexanders male lover. Icons Anthony Hopkins (as Ptolemy the narrator) Christopher Plummer (as Aristotle) and Brian Blessed (as a nameless wrestling instructor) provide a respectability quotient. (Blessed strengthens the I Claudius connection since he was Augustus in the BBC mini-series.) Although Im sure this isnt the case one could fashion a convincing argument that Stone made this movie for himself. It has limited - if any - mass appeal and is likely to make Warner Brothers executives nervous. Those going to this film expecting glorious battles and epic triumphs along the lines of Braveheart or Gladiator will feel cheated. In fact one of the least accomplished elements of Alexander are the battles. They are filmed in a plodding unenergetic manner and the editing is choppy. The Lord of the Rings recently proved how engaging a well-assembled conflict can be. Alexander shows the opposite. Another source of annoyance is the incessant chattering by Anthony Hopkins whose voiceover narrative provides Alexanders skeleton. Its too bad theres not enough meat on those bones to make this a worthwhile motion picture experience. Alexander becomes the second big-budget ancient world epic to fail this year. Unlike Troy however which tried unsuccessfully to please crowds Alexander doesnt bother to make the attempt. Never has Stones predilection for maverick cinema been more evident and more damaging to the end product.
