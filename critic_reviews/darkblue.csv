"Dark Blue. Slate Sign In Sign Up Dark Blue. Dark Blue. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 21 2003 1147 AM Cop Out Ron Shelton made two-thirds of a great police drama. Then he gave in. By David Edelstein Scene of melodramatic clunkiness from Dark Blue In the tumultuous cop picture Dark Blue (MGM) Kurt Russell plays the brutal racist Sgt. Eldon Perry Jr. and that ""Jr."" isnt incidental Perry comes from a proud line of Los Angeles enforcers. The senior Perry schooled him in hate and hes disarmingly sanguine about the need for pre-emptive strikes against miscreants. At a hearing into his young partners use of deadly force Perry testifies to a sympathetic commission ""At the end of the day the bullets were in the bad guys not us. He dropped a menace to society."" Russell has thickened himself for this part and he uses his new weight his slit eyes and his lopsided little smirk to suggest a man whose moral center--if it exists--is buried under layer upon layer of scuzz. Privately Perry brags to his wife (Lolita Davidovich) that it was he not his ""goddamned coward"" partner who ""split the guys eyeballs"" after ""the Mandingo went track star."" Perry cant even predict how repulsed his do-gooder wife will be--hes too infused with LAPD poison to see himself through her eyes. Dark Blue isnt set in some generic urban jungle. The year is 1992 mere days before the verdict that will exonerate the four LAPD cops accused of using unnecessary force to subdue Rodney King; and Perry regards the men on trial as fine officers who did their duty after crossing paths with a dangerous crackhead. Perry suspects that if the verdict is ""not guilty"" the city will burn but hes too settled in his ways--and too adroit in his work--to question his own philosophy. Theres a glint in his eye when to obtain a warrant he blackmails an assistant district attorney with dirty pictures from her sorority days and more than a hint of smugness when he brushes off her concern that no judge would sign a warrant so flimsy This particular judge over a two-olive martini scrawls his name with hardly a murmur. Perry moves in a world in which there are virtually no checks on his power. Advertisement Its a testament to Russells sharp but understated performance--and to the talent and conviction of director Ron Shelton and screenwriter David Ayer--that more than an hour goes by before the crude ham-handed morality-play structure of Dark Blue becomes apparent. This is ultimately a conversion melodrama and a clumsy one. But until it goes to hell its thrillingly good a fervid answer to the spate of cop movies that glorify brutality and sanction ends over means. The first two-thirds of the film is fast toughly acted and compellingly convoluted--dense and twisty in ways that evoke the history and politics of the LAPD of the 80s and early 90s. Ayer scripted Training Day (2001) with its fascist-monster detective (Denzel Washington) and the story is credited to the novelist James Ellroy who concocted the labyrinthine rot of L.A. Confidential. Their vision of the evil at the heart of the LAPD is mythic It goes so deep that the riot in South Central is meant to be both horrifying and poetically just--a ghastly rite of cleansing. It is--but its also juxtaposed with the feeblest melodramatic machinations imaginable. The LAPDs satanic overlord is Jack Van Meter played with piggy-eyed implacability by Brendan Gleeson. It isnt enough that Van Meter protects his men from charges of excessive force He conjures up excessive force like a black wizard. Make that a white-supremacist wizard. In the face of an investigation by his lone African-American counterpart Deputy Chief Arthur Holland (Ving Rhames) Van Meter hisses the ""n-word"" then orders that pictures of Holland in a tryst with a comely underling (Michael Michele) be left for Hollands wife to find. Despite that one extramarital lapse Holland is a dogged do-gooder who tells his packed church (and his suddenly shining-eyed wife) that he wont accept an offer to be chief of police in another city; hell stay in Los Angeles and fight these racists. Hollands rise in stature is startlingly in synch with the dwindling of Rhames charisma. Dark Blue gets even more ham-handed. The film begins with a convenience-store robbery in which four bystanders are casually murdered and its a sickening scene--more upsetting for the cameras unflinching gaze. I assumed that the killings were meant as a necessary antithesis to show that evil does exist on the streets of any major city rife with poverty and drug abuse that sometimes you do need a strong police force to protect the average citizen. But in the movies design--and this is a SPOILER folks but a just one--the murderers are working for the cop Van Meter who hides his true involvement from Perry but commands him to pin the killings on someone else. Perry orders his young partner Bobby (Scott Speedman) to execute some unfortunate scapegoat and as he does it a little African-American girl watches from a nearby window. When Bobby pulls the trigger she drops her sippy-cup. In slow motion. It smaaaaasshes on the paaaavemeeent along with Bobbys iiiinnnnoceeence. On its own terms the South Central riot is one of the scariest spectacles of its kind ever shot The African-Americans who smash and rob and pummel whites to death are terrifying without ever becoming demonic; the riot is like a living organism that develops its own furious momentum. But Shelton sandwiches his shaky hand-held footage of the melee between scenes that would embarrass the creators of Matlock. Perry strides into a police ceremony attended by department bigwigs (including Van Meter) and members of the media--all of whom seem more interested in these interdepartmental promotions than the fact that the city is going up in smoke. Perry mounts the stage takes the measure of the crowd then launches into one of those Big Speeches that have sunk conversion melodramas since the days of Frank Capra. The old-style plotting isnt just flatfooted. It seems like a grotesque violation of the real-life carnage (which includes newsreel footage from the period) on the streets. Its tempting to forgive Dark Blue its one-sided melodramatic clunkiness though because it isnt a run-of-the-mill fascist police drama. The people who cry that Hollywood is run by pansified liberals spreading the gospel of humanism conveniently forget that the most successful--and successfully exported--American genre is the vigilante movie which clings to the Death Wish/Dirty Harry template. These scenarios are engineered to make the protagonist choose violence as the only sane means of dealing with his/her problem and to make the audience consent to that violence. Films about lethal police racism its roots and its consequences are usually left to the Spike Lees of the world who are less ambivalent about violent uprising than liberals like Shelton. Dark Blue is a botch but its a bravely unfashionable botch. Its one of the few large-scale action movies that hasnt been made by nihilists. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Blue The Good Guys Are Bad Boys washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Music >> Follow Music On On Screen Blue The Good Guys Are Bad Boys Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 21 2003 THE TITLE of the film ""Dark Blue"" provides the first clue as to whats in store in this thriller of sorts about racism and corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department. On the one hand it refers to the color of the LAPD uniform. On the other it suggests a gloomy disheartening and joyless worldview. Well not entirely joyless. As depressing as its name implies the pessimistic drama set in the days leading up to the verdict in the first Rodney King police brutality trial still manages to throw out one tiny ray of hope that we as a society might not be doomed to a future of rampant malfeasance on the part of those sworn to protect us. Coming in the form of one very wicked cops 11th-hour conversion that ray of hope is thin like I said but Ill take anything that reassures me that the world I live in might -- just might -- not be as bad as the one depicted in director Ron Sheltons harrowing and compulsively watchable morality play. Based on a story by noir writer James Ellroy this grim vision of one mans spiral into the moral abyss tracks Eldon Perry (Kurt Russell) a third-generation cop who is about to make lieutenant after half a lifetime putting away bad guys. Unfortunately he has also put away (and by ""put away"" I mean ""killed"") some good guys along the way. Okay so maybe they werent exactly good guys but they were often the wrong bad guys. Is that so awful? Whats the big deal about one less lowlife on the street even if it wasnt the lowlife you were looking for? Thats the philosophy that Eldon tries to instill in Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman) his young partner on the elite Special Investigations Squad when the two are assigned to the investigation of a high-profile quadruple homicide. Well what do you know? Eldon and Bobby accidentally stumble upon the actual perps in the case but are told to come up with a patsy by their even more venal SIS boss (Brendan Gleeson) a piggish desk jockey up to his jowls in chicanery of his own. Cowed by the powerful man Eldon goes along with it; Bobby more reluctantly. One problem Assistant police chief Arthur Holland (Ving Rhames) seems to be on to the fact that the two have lied about another recent shooting. With the assistance of a beautiful aide (Michael Michele) Holland means to strip Eldon and Bobby of their badges before they can do any more damage. Have I mentioned that Bobby is sleeping with the aide? Do not look to this mess for clear-cut heroes or villains. Holland is no angel himself and even the corrupt cops are capable of doing the right thing once or twice albeit too late to make much of a difference. The climax of ""Dark Blue"" comes just as the not-guilty verdict in the King case comes in opening up the wounds of a city whose pain causes an eruption of volcanic fury. It is against this backdrop of lost souls that Eldon tries to find his wandering through a burning Los Angeles that looks literally like Hades and where a man can open up another mans head with a cinder block just because of the color of his skin. There is a certain satisfaction in watching Eldon turn his back on the culture of corruption that has sustained him but as ""Dark Blue"" seems to remind us he has done the devils work too long for his change of heart to mean anything except to the ultimate judge.

"A Cop on the Verge washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On A Cop on the Verge Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 21 2003 The last time Ron Shelton made this film it was called ""Cobb"" and he forgot all the guns. I exaggerate but only slightly. Shelton an ex-professional athlete has been obsessed with codes of masculine behavior his entire career and he knew how men talked when women werent around (it isnt pretty). These attributes made ""Bull Durham"" a natural for him ""White Men Cant Jump"" a necessity and ""Cobb"" an inevitability. The questions he asks in all of them are extremely interesting When does toughness become bullying? When does will to win become need to dominate? When does courage become sociopathic obsession? When does a hero become a monster? Now with very little deviation in theme and only slight deviation in milieu he moves those inquiries into another world and in ""Dark Blue"" Shelton studies whats old and familiar to him excessive male aggression verging on the sociopathic fueled by anger alcohol fear of aging and pure-D Gol-dang love of kicking butt. In a ballplayer like Ty Cobb those fiery attributes can create a legend albeit an eminently despicable one. In a cop they are bad news with a capital B and N. And Eldon Perry (Kurt Russell) is very bad news. A star member of the Los Angeles Police Departments Special Investigation Section (here called the Special Investigations Squad) historically an elite if controversially gun-happy unit that went after criminals who had eluded others hes everything were supposed to hate violent racist tough a stone killer. Hes that crown prince of macho myth the difficult man abusive resentful bitter and loud. Yet at the same time Shelton and the movie cant quite keep from admiring his gusto his bravado his swagger. As I say You hate him but you love to watch him in action because hes the man who knows what to do next. When all about him have lost their heads he shoots to kill. (Russell is brilliant in the role.) The movie is set over the five days in April 1992 when a Simi Valley Calif. jury considered the fate of the four police officers who beat Rodney King. The movie finds great symbolism in that event as both the high-water mark of and the beginning of the end of the white empire of the LAPD and Shelton spins into his tale the story of the downfall of the SIS within the LAPD. Alas the movie is so very busy. Look at poor Eldon Look at his issues. Hes got to break in a new rookie partner Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman) hes got to solve the murder of four people in a particularly violent mom and pop robbery hes got to please his duplicitous manipulative ambitious SIS boss Jack Van Meter (Brendan Gleeson) hes got to penetrate an evil conspiracy inside the department hes got to blackmail a superior hes got to evade the rage of reformist police executive Arthur Holland (Ving Rhames) hes got to deal with the fact that his wife (Lolita Davidovich actually Sheltons wife) is about to leave him and that his son hates him hes got to prepare a speech for his promotion to lieutenant. Its hard to get this done on a mere fifth of Scotch a day and things get even more hectic when as all these plot tracks collide on a single day the riots break out so hes got to evade people throwing bricks through his windshield. Say this for Shelton He offends everybody equally. White conservatives will take no pleasure in his portrayal of the blue centurions as corrupt drunken racist cowboys and black liberals will take no pleasure in his depiction of the rioters as violent worthless thugs trying to steal as many televisions and murder as many innocent white motorists as possible. If both camps are mad he must be doing something right. But one of the things he doesnt do right is find an ending to the movie. While for much of its running time ""Dark Blue"" with its incendiary violence and its straight-on look at how things probably are in a real world really grips it founders for a climax and comes up with one particularly inappropriate. Climaxes as any hack novelist knows should reflect the character of the characters involved in them. Shelton defies that principle. So Eldon whatever his manifold weaknesses as a man is believable and admirable only in action but when the movies destiny is at stake he mounts a podium and delivers a long rambling meant-to-be ironic speech that utterly deflates the considerable momentum the film has by that point built up. The movie ends not with a bang but a wimp. Come on Eldon do something dont just talk. What are you suddenly sensitive or something? Dark Blue (116 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme violence.

The L.A. police sergeant played by Kurt Russell frequently looks as if a 19th-century Army and its horses spent the night camping out in his mouth. Hung over with bloodshot eyes and sporting lots of facial stubble Russell has been cutting legal corners for so long that he has developed perilously skewed ideas of right and wrong. In equally rocky shape is his personal life. The story unfolds as a jury ponders the 1992 Rodney King case and its no surprise that David Ayers screenplay is based on a story by James Ellroy whose L.A. Confidential is merely the most high-profile work in a career spent scratching the citys underbelly. But it is a mild surprise that Russell -- whose baseball-hitting prowess is part of his real-life resume-- is finally being directed by Bull Durham/Tin Cups Ron Shelton in one of Sheltons few non-sports films. Both it turns out need a jocks stamina to work their way through the plot. Russells young partner (Scott Speedman) is having an affair with a female officer (Michael Michele) though both keep their ranks and even names from each other. Internal Affairs is sniffing around both men. A key sniffer (Ving Rhames) bemoans department corruption and racism emanating from the top. Russells boss (Brendan Gleeson looking just as dissipated as Russell) purposely points him in wrong directions on a mass-murder case. You want more? Russells wife (Lolita Davidovich) has had it. Review of the movie Dark Blue ( out of four) Stars Kurt Russell Ving Rhames Scott Speedman Brendan Gleeson Lolita Davidovich Michael Michele Director Ron Shelton Rating R for violence language and sexuality Opens Friday nationwide Theres at least one plot element too many here; let your own taste determine which one. Yet until it dissolves into conventional melodrama during a climactic fracas this fast-paced story is never less than watchable. Its especially riveting once the jury renders its not-guilty verdict and the city explodes. Russell whose character had nothing to do with the beating tries dodging looters and barricades while burning rubber (sometimes backward) down L.A. streets. The scene excites and feels authentic but isnt likely to distinguish the movie with audiences who ignored the Detroit-based Narc which has just as much grit but a tighter story. Those are those who should ignore both movies police-force recruiters.

(AP ... more Below the law / Russell reigns in Dark Blues underworld of crooks and crooked cops 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Dark Blue Drama. Starring Kurt Russell Scott Speedman and Ving Rhames. Directed by Ron Shelton. (R. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) They dont get more grim than ""Dark Blue"" a police thriller about violent crime within and without the Los Angeles Police Department . Up to its elbows in gore the movie presents a soulless world in which human life is just animated meat. It takes more than a shower to wash the memory of this one away. Actually it takes more than a few weeks. Yet while ""Dark Blue"" may not be easy to watch its exceptionally well made. Unmistakably authentic -- and all the more disturbing for that reason -- it presents violence not with the usual movie-style theatricality but with the graphic abruptness of real life as captured on a surveillance video. Likewise while many movies strive to imitate the gutter bonhomie of cops and crooks the dialogue in this films screenplay -- written by David Ayer from a story by James Ellroy -- hits the ear as real. ""Dark Blue"" is set in Los Angeles in the days leading up to the riots following the Rodney King verdict in 1992. Its directed by Ron Shelton who is best known for his sports films (""Bull Durham"" ""White Men Cant Jump"" ""Cobb"" ""Tin Cup""). While his new film has a decidedly darker atmosphere Sheltons years of service in the towel-snapping realms come in handy The police and criminals exist here in what is pretty much a mens world and the worst among them seem to think its all a game. Thats certainly the attitude of Eldon a police sergeant in a special investigations division played by Kurt Russell with a joie de vivre -- or joie de mort -- that makes him magnetic. Never has the life of a corrupt cop seemed more like fun. Watching Russell we sense the exhilaration of being cut free from all laws and all morality of being set loose on the street with a license to kill or abuse or satisfy any whim generous or cruel. Eldon is a man unbound or thinks he is and Russell conveys that in a performance of physical freedom and emotional volatility. Most of ""Dark Blue"" involves two investigations. Eldon and his partner Bobby (Scott Speedman) investigate a shooting in a small grocery store -- a crime involving the death of several people that the audience sees in the first minutes of the film and probably wishes it hadnt. Meanwhile an honest deputy police chief (Ving Rhames) investigates Eldon and Bobby for a recent and highly questionable exercise of lethal force. In Ellroys Los Angeles corruption doesnt mean ignoring vice in exchange for an envelope filled with 100 bills. It means pinning crimes on innocent parties and even committing murder. In ""Dark Blue"" the phrase ""do what you do"" is what Eldons superior -- the dean of L.A. corruption (Brendan Gleeson) -- says when he wants Eldon to go kill somebody whos become inconvenient. The line between the cops and crooks isnt blurry. Its the same team with different uniforms. While telling an intricate ever-shifting story Shelton and Ayer take time to show the psychological effects of a soul-dead corrupt life. When Eldon comes home at night to his wife (Lolita Davidovich) its as weird for him as returning to a quiet house after a rock concert. He cant turn it off. He cant speak softly. He cant stop cursing or laughing inappropriately at horrible things. He has become a creature of the street who belongs nowhere else. As the honest chief Rhames is solid as always and Speedman brings a nice quality of nascent virtue to his role as Eldons young sidekick. But its Russell whom audiences will come away talking about. This is an actor who has never been less than competent but here he either leaps to a whole other level -- or maybe finally gets to show what his level truly is. His climactic monologue is the stuff of anthologies inventive and flawless. The Los Angeles riot in ""Dark Blue"" explicitly re-created hovers over everything and finally explodes in a way similar to the draft riots in ""Gangs of New York."" But in ""Gangs of New York"" the riots function as a kind of deus ex machina while in ""Dark Blue"" the riot is integrated into the action and themes of the story. Its interesting and unexpected. Sheltons new film is as blood-drenched but more skillful than Scorseses. - This film contains strong language sexual situations and brutal graphic violence.

Ron Sheltons hyperkinetic new action drama Dark Blue takes place in the period between the Rodney King beating and the trial of the police officers involved. The movies foreground is systemic corruption in the SIS (Special Investigations Squad) an elite cadre within the LAPD and the feverish opening scene suggests that we might be about to see into the lost soul of one of its members. Eldon Perry played with feral incandescence by Kurt Russell -- who grows more Nolte-like with age -- agitatedly paces his dingy Hollywood motel room. The television blares its nth repeat of the videotape showing the cops clubbing King to the ground; the trial verdicts are about to be announced. We dont yet know about the source of Perrys anguish though the passage of his deeply compromised years shows in his rheumy eyes and puffy unshaven face flushed with last nights liquor and as it turns out two pieces of very bad news. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Eldon we soon learn has spent his life following horrible examples -- notably that of his father also a cop and of the slippery SIS boss Jack Van Meter (the excellent Brendan Gleeson) -- and hes now busy passing them on to his partner Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman) a wet-behind-the-ears rookie who has no idea what hes getting himself into. In the eyes of his superiors Eldon is a star whos long overdue for a promotion. When he fudges or ignores the rules his bosses go through the motions of disciplinary inquiry but they dont give a damn what he does so long as he gets his man. The Los Angeles Police Department refused to cooperate in the making of Dark Blue -- no ride-alongs no nothing -- and though the churlish among us might conclude that this is because the movie portrays the SIS as a barrel full of rotten apples my own view is that like me the LAPD was defeated by the movies incestuously proliferating plots. Ive seen Dark Blue twice and I still dont have a handle on all its comings and goings . . . but here goes. The main event is Perry and Keoughs pursuit of a quadruple homicide -- possibly racially motivated -- perpetrated in a Korean convenience store by Orchard and Sidwell who sound like mutual-fund managers but are in fact an interracial brace of thugs (played by rap artist Kurupt and Dash Mihok) who also happen to be Van Meters top informants and more. Additionally Bobby happens to be Van Meters nephew and happens to be sleeping with Beth (Michael Michele) who happens to be deputy to the lone honest cop in the whole setup assistant LAPD chief Holland (Ving Rhames) with whom Beth whos also black happened to have a one-night stand five years earlier. Dark Blue is stuffed to the gills with blithely improbable coincidence and subsidiary story lines including two separate internal investigations and Eldons failing marriage to a weary prison officer (Lolita Davidovich). Amid all this foreground the background all but disappears and Dark Blue proclaims itself a character drama and a voyage of self-discovery for the flawed cop -- which proves to be its fatal weakness. Dark Blue is based on an unpublished story by James Ellroy and its hard to imagine two more disparate sensibilities than Ellroys and Sheltons though each in his way is a dyed-in-the-wool romantic. A congenital apocalyptic Ellroy gets off on venality and corruption the way Shelton gets off on sports and sex. A little of Ellroys hepcat swagger goes a long way for my money but hes never been one to dilute his bleak vision of humanity (let alone the LAPD) with tales of redemption. He is also unsentimental about race and one can only imagine him rolling his eyes at the unsullied nobility of assistant chief Holland (the usually reliable Rhames declaims his lines like a cardboard Roman emperor) never mind the prodigal homecoming of Eldon Perry.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Shelton is a likable generous director whos made two pretty good films (Blaze and Bull Durham) but its not at all clear he has the chops to take on an action movie let alone the intricacies of police politics -- let alone the politics of race about which he had more imaginative things to say in White Men Cant Jump. Despite screenwriter David Ayers bona fides as a South-Central homey (see accompanying interview) the movies vision of that neighborhood seems hackneyed and reductive pared down to the usual shorthand of seedy tenements and a rap score. The Rodney King beating is no more than a scenic backdrop; Shelton and Ayer make little serious effort at commentary on the trials significance for race relations in L.A. In a vain attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable Dark Blue struggles to be at once realist and utopian The system stinks but one man with an improved attitude can make a difference. Just how wishful this is we know from the Rampart scandal but neither hindsight nor history is relevant here. By the movies climax Eldon has become a bad son and as good a man as he can ever be. Having witnessed this internal cleansing the LAPD streams cheerfully en masse out of the Police Academy and deigns to notice that the city is on fire. THE OLD AMNESIA GAMBIT DRAGS ITSELF wearily back into service in Till Human Voices Wake Us Australian director Michael Petronis ditsy tale of release from the pain of the past. Petroni wrote the screenplay for the awful The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys but thats no excuse for frittering away the gifts of Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential) who plays Sam Franks a lonely buttoned-down psychiatrist returning to his childhood home to bury his father -- a dreadful stiff himself even in life -- and face up to childhood memories hes managed to repress until now. There he meets Ruby (Helena Bonham Carter wearing a capable Aussie accent and walking through her wide-eyed open-mouthed mussy-haired gamine shtick) a mysterious stranger with more than a whiff of the familiar about her. Following a gothically realized fall from a bridge on a dark and stormy night Ruby has lost her memory and as Sam deploys all his professional skills to help her recollect whats troubling her his own private trauma comes to the fore in alarming but finally therapeutic flashbacks. Till Human Voices Wake Us was apparently inspired by the last lines of T.S. Eliots The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock -- an attempt to curry pedigree that would have horrified Eliot who was the least mawkish of poets. The Australian bush appears to exquisite advantage via the camera of Roger Lanser. Otherwise -- except for a deliciously gaga image of Pearce floating beatifically downriver in his undies -- I can find nothing nice to note about this excruciatingly slow overly tasteful piece of whimsy a characteristically wan offering from Paramount Classics which after four years as the indie arm of its parent studio has still not crafted an identity worth knowing.

This article was corrected on Jan. 14 2003. Ron Sheltons customary sports themes are left aside in his first cop drama ""Dark Blue"" which lands the director in distinguished company with preeminent contemporary American crime novelist James Ellroy and screenwriter David Ayer (""Training Day""). Refreshingly devoid of flashiness or artificially pumped-up action this consistently gripping well-constructed police thriller set against the backdrop of the 1992 riots in South-Central L.A. showcases a tightly controlled performance from Kurt Russell. Modestly budgeted MGM release probably lacks the pyrotechnics for multiplex impact but should draw discerning adult genre fans on the ancillary beat. After winning top prize at the national Noir fest in Courmayeur in December Italian distrib CDI opened the film Jan. 10 ahead of MGMs Feb. 21 U.S. release pushed back from last fall. Commercially ""Dark Blue"" may jostle with the heavily promoted ""Narc"" for attention. However while they belong to the same genre and share the police-corruption theme and two-cop dynamic the two thrillers are vastly dissimilar in style Joe Carnahans film is a sustained exercise in bruising volatile intensity whereas Sheltons approach is calm methodical and more introspective equally edgy but quieter and arguably more downbeat. Originally titled ""The Plague Season"" the story was Ellroys first original screenplay and centered around the 1965 Watts Riots in Los Angeles. After years in development Ellroy then contemporized the action resetting it against the urban unrest that exploded from the acquittal in 1992 of four white LAPD officers in the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King. Ayers rewrite of the material may have influenced his work on ""Training Day"" given that both films involve a seasoned seemingly invulnerable rogue cop with a morally questioning and increasingly distanced younger partner. Russell plays Eldon Perry a hard-ass sergeant from a long line of cops partnered with malleable young rookie Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman) in an elite SIS unit headed by deeply corrupt Jack Van Meter (Brendan Gleeson). Opening scenes intercut an investigative hearing by politically ambitious deputy chief Holland (Ving Rhames) into the use of deadly force on a suspect by Keough with a robbery and quadruple homicide by hot-headed dolts Orchard (Kurupt) and Sidwell (Dash Minok). The felons strings are revealed to be pulled by Van Meter who orders the regular cops off the case and places Eldon and Bobby in charge giving them strict instructions to steer the investigation away from his ""informants"" and pin the murders on two unconnected ex-cons. While the younger cop balks at the assignment Eldons family loyalties and his own jaded view of justice make carrying out Van Meters orders hardly more unconscionable than anything else in the line of duty. Backing key action are constant reminders of the imminent King-beating verdict via radio and TV broadcasts that create a racially charged environment in which negative media attention casts the LAPD in an unflattering light. Personal angles are exposed via scenes that never fully come to life conveying Eldons troubled relationship with his wife (Lolita Davidovich) a prison officer increasingly unsettled by what her husband has become. Bobbys life outside work comes into focus through his budding romance with fellow officer Beth (Michael Michelle). They agree to withhold their names and ranks from each other to keep cop concerns out of the relationship. The tense final act unfolds as Van Meter sets Eldon up for a fall.The tragic outcome appears headed into disappointingly movieish territory when Eldon takes the stage at a police promotion ceremony his eyes now open to the full extent of Van Meters duplicity. But Ayers screenplay deftly pulls back from anything Hollywood redemptive ending on a grim note as L.A. burns in the riots.Ellroy reportedly wrote the story with Russell in mind and its very much the actors show. Cold cocky and reprehensible with repugnant views on justice and society Eldon is gradually brought around by Russell using subtle measured means to expose the characters moments of doubt and nagging self-disgust without having him miraculously discover a conscience overnight. Gleeson also makes a strong impression as a thoroughly contemptible man with no loyalty or morality while other cast members do perhaps all thats required of them with less nuanced characters. Rhames in particular seems underused in a generically noble role. Lenser Barry Peterson captures the uncosmeticized side of L.A. drenched in an uncharacteristic amount of light for this type of dark material making it a harsh sun baked physically flat setting for violence and corruption. Peppered with rap the textured soundtrack is graced by Terence Blanchards eclectic score which mixes melancholy bluesy tunes with cranked-up 70s sounds effectively complementing the suspense factor.
