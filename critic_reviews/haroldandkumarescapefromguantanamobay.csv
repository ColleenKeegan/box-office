(jaimie trueblood/new line cinema) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / April 25 2008 ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" in record time - just one scene. But the Indian-American med-student stoner and his tense Korean-American roommate remain prisoners of the same cruddy filmmaking that made their trip to White Castle a cult hit in 2003. And the political punch the title promises goes largely undelivered.Both comedies were written and directed by Hayden Schlossberg and Jon Hurwitz who demonstrate low-tech faithfulness to the movies scatological pursuits Almost every scene looks vomited up.On his way to Amsterdam Kumar (Kal Penn) is caught using a homemade smokeless bong in an airplane bathroom. The bong look likes a bomb and to the suspicious eye Kumar looks like an Arab terrorist. The government presumes Harold (John Cho) to be his North Korean accomplice. And so theyre dragged to Gitmo where prison-movie sexual horrors await.Once they break out they never stop running. And the adventure they have is a sporadically funny gross-out picaresque. It stretches from a nude house party in Miami to a poor black Alabama neighborhood to a backwoods Klan rally to a whorehouse with Neil Patrick Harris reprising his role as a macho version of himself to a Texas wedding where Kumars ex is getting married.As they make their way west pursued by a homeland security Nazi (Rob Corddry) you realize that Harold and Kumars brief nightmare incarceration hasnt made them rebellious or angry. Its made them more passive than ever. Our lovable heroes are shameless cowards. The most impassioned moment involves the recitation of a math poem. Otherwise Harold and Kumar dont rage against the machine. They get stoned with it sharing a joint with George W. Bush and hearing his side of things. He sounds wise and a little holy which is fair balanced and extremely surreal. Kumar gives airport security the business - not the president who more or less authorized the duos imprisonment.Which raises a concern Is a truly political stoner movie even possible? The entire point of getting high is to take some of the sting out of life. The movie goes after easy targets and goes soft on the harder issues.Corddrys character who manages to cast certain parts of the current government as ruthlessly bigoted is the films best satirical device. But Harold and Kumar seem blissfully immune safely ensconced in fantasyland. Escaping from Guantanamo is a wish only the best pot can grant.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

By David Denby Tim Robbins fights back in a movie directed by Henry Bean.   Credit TOM BACHTELL David Owen (Tim Robbins) the outraged hero of ""Noise"" is a pain in the neck and depending on your point of view either the craziest or the sanest man in New York. Making love one night to his wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) David is interrupted and unmanned by the Klaxon serenade of a car alarm. Helen tells him to ignore it but he cant. Forgetting to pull on his pants he runs into the street and brings the evening to a climax by bashing the hell out of the offending automobile. ""Noise"" a splendidly eccentric independent film written and directed by Henry Bean (""The Believer"") is devoted to the life of a true obsessive David has a job (hes some sort of lawyer) and he loves his wife and his young daughter but his only real interest is New York clatter--its generation its persistence and triumphantly its eradication. David feels himself besieged by sirens by construction-site drilling by firemen testing their portable saws every morning in front of the firehouse. But car alarms are the special toxin eating into his hide. Easily provoked like high-strung Chihuahuas they erupt when someone brushes against a car or even just stares at one and David attacks the throbbing vehicles with baseball bats and hammers; he slashes tires snips wires and jumps up and down on hoods like a drunken teen-ager. The silence that results is the only satisfaction David can attain. Beans touch is unsteady and ""Noise"" is certainly odd but the movie is alive with the creative madness of New York. It turns out that David wouldnt think of living in a calm and quiet place. His struggle against noise gives his life an epic grandeur. Henry Bean is obviously drawn to monomaniacs. ""The Believer"" (2001) which featured a startling performance by Ryan Gosling was about Danny Balint a young Jew who so hates the way that Jews have been victimized that he rejects his identity and takes up with the persecutors becoming an American Nazi before drifting back to Orthodox ritual. Danny Balint moved through a clear arc but for a long time we dont know how to take David Owen and I think the ambiguity is intentional. Theres no suggestion for instance that Davids sensitivity to noise is a clinical condition. The people around him including his wife assume that hes having a nervous breakdown. They worry over him and urge him to put up with the racket as they do. His response is that they are passively accepting an attack on their bodies and their souls. He talks like a newly aroused revolutionary and Tim Robbins plays him with a scowl that gives way to an impish grin. In the past Robbinss rubbery features slow tempo and sludgy voice have been a problem. If it werent for that sly smile which takes over his face and becomes radiantly joyous he might be impossible to watch. Surely a more glamorous actor would have given ""Noise"" a lighter more satirical spin but Robbins makes David a lost unhappy man who needs to save himself and thats the right way to go--it turns a one-note story into a universal fable. David can seem mulish and out of it. (Everyone in the movie including his daughter is smarter than he is.) When he says that he feels impotent hes not just talking about sex. Noise for him is all the frustrations and anathemas of adult life rolled into one. When he rouses himself from torpor however he becomes inspired and in the end we think hes not crazy but a man who refuses to suffer anymore. The movie is a soul journey posing as a comedy. David growing ambitious puts on a trenchcoat and begins striking at night. He becomes famous in the city as the Rectifier which causes the mayor (William Hurt) a strutting jerk who hates everybody to blow up. He thinks that the mysterious noise eliminator is a threat to his power and he wants to destroy him. At this point Bean seems to be teasing ""Batman"" and other dark-city fantasias of lonely superheroes. But then he shifts his ground David circulates petitions to get an anti-noise motion on an election ballot and for a while ""Noise"" loses its neurotic intensity and becomes a story about a resourceful crusader like Erin Brockovich--in this case an urban activist. This citizenly part of the movie is halfhearted and a mistake Bean rationalizes a passion whose solitary obsession was integral to its majesty. What saves ""Noise""--and makes it almost continuously entertaining--is Beans sense of the city as a gathering place of clever chattering people. As David Owen smashes alarm bells in broad daylight pedestrians stand around making wisecracks. When hes put on trial the jurors turn into comedians. David also links up with a recent arrival to the city Ekatrina (Margarita Levieva) a soulful Russian philosophy student and writer who works in her uncles downtown furniture store. She has no particular thing about noise but believes in Davids mission. Levieva a former Olympic gymnast from St. Petersburg who has appeared in the TV series ""Vanished"" leans across a table and stares at Robbins with a fervent intelligence the likes of which we havent seen in American movies for years. She offers to this morose man both deep-dish discussion (Hegels dialectic of the self and the other--that is the man and the car horn) and kinky sex. She possesses so strong a temperament that she seems to come not from another country but from another planet where human beings have reached a more advanced state of evolution. I would watch her in anything including a Bean sequel called ""Silence"" in which her luminous eyes filled the screen for the entire movie. ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay"" a loosely strung-together collection of sex race and stoner jokes is by any rational standard a terrible movie yet I kept laughing at it and I came out of the theatre in a good mood. Low comedy in the movies as you may have noticed keeps sinking lower. We have gone from candor to shock to nudity in this cinematic burlesque show the baggy pants keep dropping and occasionally fall off altogether. ""Guantanamo"" is perhaps the first bottomless comedy--much of the humor and a fair amount of the nakedness is concentrated below the belt. Both sexes I suppose are somewhat degraded but theres a universality of rudeness in the movies attack which absolves it of malice toward any particular group. Personal dignity may have disappeared but so have political correctness and ethnic squeamishness. While a large part of the mainstream press ties itself in knots in an attempt to avoid insulting anyone a manically tasteless movie like this blithely assumes that to be an American is to be ridiculous in one way or another. Yet ""Guantanamo"" which was written and directed by the team of Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg who also wrote (but did not direct) ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" is not entirely harmless. Among other things the movie is a farce about Bush-era paranoia. Harold (John Cho) a Korean-American financial analyst and Kumar (Kal Penn) an Indian-American would-be medical student are on a plane to Amsterdam when Kumar lights up a bong in the bathroom. When ""bong"" is misheard as ""bomb"" the boys are arrested yelled at and shipped off to Guantanamo where they are threatened with sexual humiliations--an adolescent nod to what happened at Abu Ghraib. The two escape travel to the mainland with the help of some obliging Cubans and roam around the South running into stereotypes who prove to be the reverse of what they seem an enormous menacing-looking black man who is a gentle-souled orthodontist; a cussing redneck hunter who takes them home to his designer log cabin. Theres no more than a ghost of a narrative holding these gags together. Indeed some of the changes from one scene to the next are so abrupt and bizarre that one cant tell if Hurwitz and Schlossberg are cinematic primitives without discipline or are trying for a kind of loose-jointed American Dada. Their skills are unreliable at best but willy-nilly theyve caught a significant demographic moment. The H.amp;K. movies in their slovenly and profane style are about the transition to a post-racial society in which as the Salon film critic Stephanie Zacharek put it ""no one in real life can say definitively what an American looks like."" Harolds parents hauled in for questioning about their ""terrorist"" son are addressed in contemptuously pronounced Korean by a Homeland Security translator and they answer in flawless colloquial English--they are Americans. The chief anti-terrorism agent (Rob Corddry) sees everyone except whites as foreigners and likely terrorist collaborators; hes the fool in this movie just as the roaming New Jersey thugs taunting the two boys of color were the losers in ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle."" The heroes themselves couldnt be more American if they had been hatched in a Campbells soup can and the rhythm of their rapport goes back seventy years to the American radio and movie routines that cracked up our grandparents. Harold is stern logical law-abiding repressed and irritable; he expects life to be orderly and sane. Kumar is foolish easily distracted sex-mad and softhearted; hes out for a good time. They are Abbott amp; Costello with dirty mouths--indomitable ungovernable and possibly immortal.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

They represent the smartening up of dumbing down. Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle was a most excellent adventure in which the two wanted little more than to chow down on a mess of midnight sliders only to discover that their ethnicity kept getting in the way. The message -- and more important the joke -- was that no one they met could see that these two were as homegrown as American pie. In Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay a fitfully funny if somewhat less excellent sequel Kumar tries to light up a homemade bong in an airplane lavatory -- but the device gets mistaken for a bomb which results in the two getting tossed into a grimy cell in Guantanamo. They escape quickly enough (do you get the feeling this movie is a bit less plausible than the first?) and once theyre on the road trying to outrun the authorities its not Harold and Kumar who keep getting misjudged by their appearance. Its everyone else -- the redneck hunter who lives in a shack thats really a sleek yuppie lair; the scary-looking black man who is actually a mild orthodontist and whom the chief government terrorist hunter tries to make talk by ""tempting"" him with a can of grape soda; our heroes parents grilled by the authorities as if they had just stepped through the gates of Ellis Island. Written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg who wrote the screenplay for the first film Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay milks the absurdity of prejudice in so many different ways that it threatens at moments to wilt into a didactic liberal fable. Its a mesh of the funny and the draggy though the comedy is goosed along by little volts of shock and edge a ""bottomless"" party at which people quite graphically wear tops and nothing else; the appearance of an even more riotously-self-loathing-than-before Neil Patrick Harris; an encounter with a daddy-fearin dope-smokin Dubya who seems in his total aspect at least faintly halfway...plausible. Harold and Kumar fortunately never lose their verbally relentless way of delivering raunch as pure common sense. Kal Penn who knows just how to bounce his quick affectless delivery off his mischievous features never reduces Kumar to shtick -- he plays him as a fully thought-out character -- and John Cho gives Harolds constant exasperation vigor and snap. At the same time the movie reveals both of them to be not-so-secret romantics When Kumar recites a love poem which turns out to be a science nerds metaphorical plaint about the loneliness of the square root of 3 its a real Hugh Grant moment. From the look of things it wont be long before these two have to escape from adulthood.

Comments Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay After causing a ruckus aboard a flight to Amsterdam the title stoners (John Cho and Kal Penn) are detained as terror suspects and tossed into Gitmo. Poking fun at the American gulag turns out to be easier in theory than in practice and writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg wisely move on at the earliest opportunity dispatching their buzzed heroes on a Florida-to-Texas road trip to clear their names. As in Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle (2004) the jokes all revolve around weed stereotypes and Neil Patrick Harris; the stereotype stuff is by far the funniest (Jon Reep as a dirt farmer whose ramshackle house conceals swank cocktail decor Rob Corddry as a racist federal agent who tries to bribe a black witness with a can of grape soda).

"Also opening Harold amp; Kumar still likable more political - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Also opening Harold amp; Kumar still likable more political Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY In a film that is even more raunchy and raucous than its predecessor Harold and Kumar are still focused on the pleasures of weed and wild women but this long strange trip of a sequel also is surprisingly subversive and politically charged. Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay  1/2 (out of four) Where 2004s Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle concerned itself mostly with scatology and a slacker ethos the sequel adds sharp satire to the mix. John Cho and Kal Penn are back as the likable pair of stoners. This time Kumar brings marijuana on a plane to Amsterdam and the two are arrested as suspected terrorists. CLIP Watch some new antics of Harold amp; Kumar As they try to elude a Homeland Security official (Rob Corddry) the guys get an assist from a boatful of Cuban immigrants share a bed with a hillbilly cyclops dodge the Ku Klux Klan and get a ride from a drug-addled sexaholic (Neil Patrick Harris). Mostly Harold is a guilty pleasure that retains the anarchic charms of the original. (Running time 1 hour 40 minutes. Rated R for strong crude and sexual content graphic nudity pervasive language and drug use. Opens today nationwide). Deception  (out of four) Deception is not the cool noirish thriller it tries to be. Despite a cast that includes double-crossers Hugh Jackman and Ewan McGregor and Michelle Williams caught in the middle the film is a yawn. Jonathan (McGregor) is a mild-mannered corporate auditor whose life is radically altered by a meeting with Wyatt a charming lawyer (Jackman). He introduces Jonathan to a mysterious sex club known as The List. Though Deception looks slick and the color palette is intriguingly moody the decadence and intrigue devolve into a preposterous turn of events. (Running time 1 hour 48 minutes. Rated R for sexual content language brief violence and some drug use. Opens today nationwide.)

"Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay Grossly insightful | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesHarold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay Grossly insightful Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay may be just the ticket to snap Hollywoods ""War on Terror"" blues.John Cho left and Kal Penn in a scene from Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. April 25 2008Starring John Cho Kal Penn Rob Corddry Neil Patrick Harris and Danneel Harris. Written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. At major theatres. 100 minutes. 14A Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay may be just the ticket to snap Hollywoods ""War on Terror"" blues.If its the comedy hit its expected to become - unlike most movies that have anything to do with Iraq Afghanistan or 9/11 - it will also offer insight into the scrambled American psyche. Will laughter succeed where tears have failed?You dont have to read Variety to know that war-themed movies are poison for popcorn munchers with few exceptions made for acclaimed dramas or Oscar-winning docs. People go to movies to escape lifes problems not to confront them.Article Continued BelowAnd theres ""escape"" handily in the title letting us know that ethnic odd couple Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) American-born twentysomethings of Asian and South Asian descent dont tarry long at Guantanamo Bay the U.S.-run Cuban prison for suspected terrorists. This is a road movie like their 2004 debut Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle which turned the pursuit of late-night munchies into an Arthurian quest. It picks up right where White Castle left off as our accident-prone duo find themselves heading to Amsterdam to follow the girl in the elevator whom Harold has been lusting over. White Castle co-writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg are back and the movie even features the return of Neil Patrick Harris of TVs How I Met Your Mother doing his head-tripping horndog turn again for fun and plot expediency.The ante has been upped considerably this time because Harold and Kumar are chasing freedom (and girls) rather than burgers (and girls).They manage to get themselves branded as fugitive terrorists pursued by an unhinged Homeland Security boss (Rob Corddry) thanks to pothead Kumars jonesing to join a different kind of Mile High Club. If he had thered have been no adventures involving one-eyed rednecks no-necked security chiefs cross-burning KKK ralliers and a dope-smoking president who looks suspiciously like a guy who refers to himself by his middle initial. The duo brutally lampoon racial stereotypes of every stripe taking no prisoners in their rainbow coalition of rude calamity. Theyre like Borat without the moustache and with a better grasp of American culture and its this satiric subtext that saves the show from its worst excesses.Its probably wise to mention at this point that youll only enjoy this movie if you can appreciate the lighter side of KKK rallies presidential potheads full-frontal nudists (of both genders) and Homeland Security fascists who mistake the U.S. Bill of Rights for toilet paper.This is one of those rare pictures that can gross you out and make you think at one and the same time.Key to its appeal is the chemistry of Cho and Penn the most likeable comedy duo since Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. You find yourself rooting for them even while thoughts of clubbing them also cross your mind. They erase all doubt that any race or culture has a monopoly on idiocy - or hilarity.Party on dudes and if youre looking for another insane road journey how about following Hillary and Obama in their never-ending quest for the Democratic presidential nomination?

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 25 2008 702 AM High Treason Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay reviewed. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay Everything you need to know about the difference between Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle (2004) and the just-released Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay (New Line) is right there in the titles. The original a theatrical flop that found a cult following on DVD elevated the banal quest for burgers into an improbably inspiring tribute to friendship spontaneity racial tolerance and the problem-solving properties of weed. The sequel takes a far more serious subject--racial profiling and the war on terror--and manages to render it completely banal. This movie picks up only minutes after the original ended as post-college roommates Kumar and Harold (Kal Penn and John Cho) recover from the effects of their all-night fast-food journey. (The first of many scatological gags involves the protracted and noisy evacuation of the very sliders Kumar scarfed down at the end of Part 1.) As soon as the boys get those burgers out of their system theyre off to Amsterdam where Harold plans to follow the girl of his dreams (Paula Garces) and Kumar plans to get legally baked. But Kumar ever the king of bad judgment boards the plane with a smokeless bong--or ""bomb"" as misheard by one paranoid fellow passenger. Advertisement This mix-up paired with the boys brown skin (Harold is Korean-American Kumar of Indian descent) is enough to ground the plane and land them in the clutches of a Department of Homeland Security wing nut (Rob Corddry) who takes their friendship to mean that ""al-Qaida and North Korea are working together."" The lads are summarily dispatched to Gitmo from whence--after a depressingly homophobic gag about being forced to fellate their captors--they escape on a raft full of departing Cubans. The rest of the movie is a chase through the Southern United States toward Texas where a smug college buddy with connections in the Bush administration may be able to clear their names. Pursued by the Feds Kumar and Harold careen through the deep South accruing misadventures most of which involve sex drugs or race. Some scenes like their hooded infiltration of a Ku Klux Klan meeting strike just the right note of shambling absurdity. But most of the wannabe outrageous racial humor (Corddrys interrogation techniques function on the assumption that Jews will do anything for money while blacks can be broken by withholding grape soda) is too shallow to constitute real satire. Lamest of all is the moment when having literally parachuted their way into Bushs Crawford retreat they wind up getting blazed with the commander in chief. Not only is James Adomians wax-museum Bush impersonation a far cry from Will Ferrells but the warm and fuzzy bonhomie of this scene betrays whatever mildly subversive humor might have preceded it. If smoking pot makes even the guy responsible for Guantanamo into a high-fiving bro isnt that an insult to the good name of weed? This may be the worst sin of Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay It betrays the spirit of the stoner comedy which has traditionally been subversive--when it wasnt detailing the love affair between two marginally functional young men and their stash of sweet sweet herb. (Last years Smiley Face in which Anna Faris played a solo female stoner was an underrated exception to the two-guy rule.) Toking up is all the better with that one friend who really gets you--and that friendship in turn is burnished by the weed-fueled adventures you share. Cho and Penns giggly chemistry in the first movie was a celebration of that sacred bond. But not only are Kumar and Harold hardly ever high this time around; theyre scarcely on speaking terms. For a good four-fifths of the film Harold is fuming about Kumars (admittedly idiotic) sabotage of their Amsterdam trip and his grudge saddles the movie with a mood of glum sourness. Neil Patrick Harris reprising a cameo role as his ex-Doogie Howser self is a welcome diversion--but his characters eventual fate is such a puzzling downer you find yourself wishing against all your best instincts for a sequel. Harold and Kumar Toke Up in Tora Bora? If you were really really high that might be good for a laugh. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

Starring John Cho Kal Penn Danneel Harris and Neil Patrick Harris. Directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. As its title implies ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" takes far more risks and covers more ground than when the lads goal merely was to down dozens of White Castles in their native New Jersey. Thats the prerogative of creating a cult comedy the first time out although filmmakers often are too intimidated by the Hollywood system to take advantage of it. This sequel edges close to ""Borat"" in its outrageous political imaginings. President Bush is a pothead who laces his marijuana with blow and tells off his father with a series of expletives and the guards at Guantanamo Bay demand a certain sexual favor from prisoners at dinnertime. To go this far out you better be sure the material is funny and it is much of the time. ""Guantanamo Bay"" sometimes misses. An opening scene of Kumar on the toilet relieving himself of all those burgers is tasteless even for a movie that intends to celebrate bad taste. And the potty jokes keep on coming. The film is carried by its charismatic stars John Cho as Harold and Kal Penn as Kumar. Kumar plays Laurel to Harolds Hardy continually getting the pair into messes. Cho is a marvel at displaying exasperation his face contorting into a frown. Penn brings a confidence to Kumar thats partially an act. His bravado fades when the two are arrested on an airplane headed for Amsterdam where Harold hoped to track down a gorgeous neighbor he has a crush on. Screenwriters Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have some fun with the way anyone of color can be suspected of being a terrorist. Kumar an Indian American is stopped by an airport guard for a so-called random security check. Onboard an elderly passenger scrutinizes him and her imagination goes wild. She sees a menacing figure in a turban with a beard down his chest. Its a funny visual but Woody Allen did it 30 years ago in ""Annie Hall."" Kumar invites trouble by smuggling marijuana and a ""smokeless bong"" onto the plane. While showing off the apparatus to Harold in the john - this movie cant stay out of the toilet - the door swings open. Kumar cant convince panicked passengers that what hes holding is a bong and not a bomb. A zealous deputy chief of Homeland Security delights in ordering the pals be detained at Guantanamo Bay which - you guessed it - they promptly escape from. For the rest of the movie theyre on the road and on the lam the latter made tricky by their orange prison garb. Along the way Harold and Kumar attend a bottomless party thrown by an acquaintance whos bored with topless social gatherings. They also hook up with Neil Patrick Harris playing himself as he did in the first ""Harold amp; Kumar"" film. Once again he trades on lines from his best remembered role as the brilliant teenage doctor in ""Doogie Howser M.D."" The police in awe of meeting Doogie let him through a barricade set up to catch Harold and Kumar who are bundled up under blankets in Harris backseat. The second ""Harold amp; Kumar"" has a romantic leitmotif thats often at odds with everything else the movie is trying to do. Kumar runs into his former girlfriend Vanessa (Danneel Harris) and experiences remorse after learning that shes about to be married. Harris is too bubbly to be believable and she and Penn lack chemistry. You dont buy that they were once a couple. Like the stand-up comic who cant resist a call for an encore Harold and Kumar continue cracking jokes throughout the credits. Be sure to stay till the end. Its the last you will see of these two - until the next sequel that is. -- Advisory Partial nudity and raunchy language. ) Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 7 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 10 Parilia Ball - San Francisco orgiastic event from almost a...

Hmm melting pot - the Korean-American Harold (John Cho) and Indian-American Kumar (Kal Penn) both weed-obsessed bring new meaning to the term. Like its fried forerunner 2004s Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle the crude lewd Escape offers a mix of nasty toilet jokes and sex gags but the gratuitous nudity (male and female) and crazy cannabis-ness are there to serve a greater good to mock social and political hypocrisy a culture steeped in prejudice and pretense. So how do doobie brothers Harold and Kumar find themselves in the infamous offshore internment camp anyway? Easy Kumar has smuggled pot onto a plane bound for Amsterdam and hes invented a smokeless bong to inhale it. But when a passenger sees the tubular glass gizmo and the dark-skinned ""foreigner"" holding it she screams terrorist Sky marshals wrestle Kumar and his buddy - er accomplice - to the ground. Kumars explanation - that its only a bong - doesnt help. Bong bomb sounds the same no? Al-Qaeda the KKK and the Department of Homeland Security all receive a going-over as our heroes manage to get from Gitmo fleeing to Miami and then on to Alabama (creepy rednecks menacing blacks) and finally Texas and a bonding session with a certain sitting president. Rob Corddry is the lunkhead Fed overseeing the manhunt and Neil Patrick Harris reprises his White Castle role as ""Neil Patrick Harris"" - finding the boys in the Deep South and chauffeuring them west. Never mind that the former Doogie Howser is so blotto on shrooms that he sees magical unicorns out the car window. Escape from Guantanamo has been written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. These learned gentlemen wrote the first Harold amp; Kumar but left the directing chores to the man behind Dude Wheres My Car? In the ensuing years they seem to have learned how to say ""Action"" and ""Cut"" and stars Cho and Penn seem to have heard them. Its not exactly high art but its certainly high. Harold amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay  (Out of four stars) Directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. With John Cho Kal Penn Rob Corddry Daneel Harris and Neil Patrick Harris.

Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (R) New Line/Warner Bros. (102 min.) Directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. With Kal Penn John Cho. Now playing in New Jersey. TWO STARS ""History repeats itself"" Karl Marx wrote ""first as tragedy second as farce."" Which I suppose helps explain why on the same day weve seen both the release of ""Standard Operating Procedure"" a nonfiction film about the Abu Ghraib prison horrors and ""Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay"" a comedy about the strict Caribbean detention center. At least it explains ""Harold and Kumar"" as much as anything can. A slow-arriving sequel to the 2004 stoner comedy the movie brings us Kal Penn and John Cho as the Oscar and Felix of hazy dorm rooms a slightly uptight scholar and a pre-med student whose primary interest in biology seems to be discovering just how high a concentration of THC he can tolerate. The first picture ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" sent the Jersey boys up and down the highways and byways in search of some desperately needed sliders; this film has them heading to Amsterdam. But then things go weirdly awry -- thanks of course to Kumar -- and the buds get branded as terrorists and thrown into prison. Those scenes strain credulity -- in fact they pretty much get it down on the floor and twist it into knots -- and the Gitmo scenes are full of the crudest gay gags and bathroom humor. (Then again a movie that begins with jokes about diarrhea and other bodily fluids has already announced its low intentions.) But then Harold and Kumar escape. And the movie gets truly strange. Pursued by a lunatic government agent -- Rob Corddry at his most unfunny -- they take off across America. One night they find refuge in a home of inbred Alabamans. Another night they flee the Klan. Encounters with absurdly endowed prostitutes a baby cyclops and Neil Patrick Harris are also included. The lowest common denominator is reached regularly and Penn tends to mug as Kumar; then again a character whose every other sentence begins ""Dude"" cant be played for drawing-room comedy. But Cho is actually quite ingratiating as the low-key long-suffering Harold and the two actors play off each other well. When it forgets the gross-out gags for a moment the movie actually becomes rather sweet. Although Harold and Kumar are Korean-American and Indian-American the film doesnt make fun of their heritage. More to the point it doesnt even notice it. What it makes fun of are the people who do notice it immediately and then cant forget it for a moment. In fact most of the movies best (and subtlest) jokes come from confounding expectations. A rural shack turns out to have a modern interior lined with bookshelves; a threatening giant in the hood turns out to be a civic-minded dentist. No one is necessarily what we assume the movie quietly cautions and thats its smartest sanest message. That and dont try to use a bong in an airplane bathroom. Of course ""Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" is not a message movie. Sometimes its barely a movie at all. Creators Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg -- here directing their material for the first time -- arent natural filmmakers. Characters appear out of nowhere and just as suddenly vanish; some jokes dont pay off and the scenes dont really track. The whole film feels easily distracted and apt to laugh at anything. But thats okay. So is its target audience. Rating note The film contains nudity strong language sexual situations and drug humor.

Your 12 also buys you the unforgettable sight of Rob Corddry as an agent of the Department of Homeland Security literally wiping his nether regions - yes there are skid marks - with the Bill of Rights. And you get to see prisoners at Gitmo being forced to perform sodomy on burly Marines. Remember what they say - comedy isnt pretty. Predecessor ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" made me laugh more than any movie Ive seen so far this century - and it became a cult favorite on DVD. Unlike some other members of the audience at the screening I attended I didnt laugh anywhere near as much at this far less fresh sequel - which is broader more vulgar more scattershot more overtly political and a lot less funny than it sounds on paper. Korean-American John Cho and Indian-American Kal Penn are back as the lovable stoners Harold and Kumar and the action picks up the morning after their trip to White Castle (which is never mentioned by name) where were treated - on the soundtrack - to the results of the previous nights consumption. On a flight to Amsterdam to visit Harolds girlfriend Kumar cant resist lighting up a ""smokeless"" bong in the restroom - a stunt that thanks to racial profiling quickly lands them in Gitmo on suspicion theyre part of a North Korean-al Qaeda terror conspiracy. Disappointingly the movie spends only five minutes in Cuba before the boys escape with the boat people. The rest is a road comedy as our heroes bumble across the American South - trailed by Homeland Security - headed for the wedding of Kumars old flame whose fiance has White House connections they hope will clear their names. Along the way there are encounters with the Ku Klux Klan and a redneck couple with an inbred daughter that fail to live up to their potential - youre almost waiting for Larry the Cable Guy to show up. Among the variations of gags from the original are a threesome involving Harold Kumar and a giant bag of marijuana. Overall theres a lot less toking up and a lot more Neil Patrick Harris who again plays a drug and sex-crazed version of ""himself"" as well as a visit to a bordello presided over by Beverly DAngelo. Other selling points dreamed up by writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (who wrote but did not direct the original) include much scatological humor and utterly gratuitous nudity such as perhaps the first ""bottomless party"" ever depicted in a movie. ""Its people like you who make people think Americans are stupid"" one character lectures Coddry - but the makers of ""Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" would probably consider that a compliment. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next STARR REPORT Read Next STARR REPORT Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 42626 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21540 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 14896 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Joe Neumaier Friday April 25 2008 239 AM Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay. Pot-loving college boys are mistaken for terrorists. With Kal Penn John Cho. Directors John Hurwitz Hayden Schlossberg (142). R Bodily humor drug use nudity language. At area theaters.Bad news dudes. The occasionally snicker-worthy ""Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" provides some of what fans want from its stoner heroes but given the high-concept title its a big fat missed opportunity.After all this comedy series stars two appealing actors Kal Penn and John Cho whose Indian-American and Asian-American characters comment on and mock stereotypes. After their amiable rambling in 2004s cult hit ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" they had the chance to really take on racial profiling in the war on terror yet still deliver wall-to-wall gross-out humor. That may be a lot to ask from a comedy about two guys who love pot but Harold and Kumar are not Cheech and Chong. The marijuana haze cant cloud the fact that theyre a math major and pre-med student respectively. (The movie even features Kumar reciting a witty ode to the square root of 3.) They could have been outrageous and smart. Following their munchies-fueled mishaps in the first film the Jersey college guys head to Amsterdam but thanks to paranoid airline passengers and Kumars bomb-like bong theyre mistaken for terrorists and shipped to Gitmo. They escape from incarceration too quickly and as they catch a boat to the U.S. the flick becomes a standard road movie with Kumar (Penn) hoping to disrupt his true love Marias marriage in Texas and Harold (Cho) hoping her politically connected fiance can clear their names. Rather than seeing Hamp;K beating the system the Guantanamo sequence has the all-too-obvious prison-guard sex jokes just as Rob Corddrys rabid Homeland Security agent is a one-note tough-guy parody. While Penn and Cho remain casually cool (theyre hipper than the fools who spout bigoted cliches) the movie forgets to stay true to their characters or to itself. As for the plot Kumars love for his ex-girlfriend fuels it yet a stoner comedy should never have a race-to-the-altar ending. The movie doesnt seem to know whos with it and who isnt. Neil Patrick Harris appearing as himself again has a bigger role this time but less is more with him. Meanwhile George W. Bush (played by look-alike James Adomian) lights up imparts wisdom and helps the boys win the day. Wait Harold and Kumar are down with George Bush? What are they smoking?

Courtesy of Jamie Trueblood/New Line Cinema          View Caption About video ads View Caption of When it comes to political satire how far is too far? Since its not really satirical or political ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" doesnt answer that question. It exploits post-9/11 anxieties as fodder for goofball gooniness. ""Dr. Strangelove"" its not.Not that I was expecting ""Strangelove."" But maybe just a teensy bit? I was a big fan of ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" in which collegiates Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) move mountains to satisfy their marijuana-inspired cravings for a White Castle hamburger.That film was a flop in theaters but soon became a cult favorite on DVD - hence this sequel which picks up right after the first film leaves off. It does not bode well that the first gag we are subjected to is enough to make us well gag. The films coscreenwriters and directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg alas wrote the first installment and they must have figured its best to get the gross-outs in early. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Like so much of ""Guantanamo"" they figured wrong. As is so often the case with sequels this one feels like a retread albeit on a bigger scale. This time around the boys are busted on a plane en route to Amsterdam because Kumar unable to spend six hours without getting high smuggles his homemade ""smokeless bong"" into the bathroom. Mistaken for terrorists they are whisked to Gitmo where the ""political"" satire consists of more gag-inducing gross-outs. (Warning Much of the humor or so-called humor in this film is strongly explicit.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Viewers may wish to escape from Guantanamo Its an indication of how unserious the politics in this film are that the boys prison stay over is just a blip on the screen.Once they escape and are seeking exoneration they make their way through Miami and the Deep South where they encounter a Ku Klux Klan rally - more big laughs here - and eventually end up parachuting right into the Texas homestead of none other than George W. Bush (James Adomian) who reveals himself to be a fellow spirit - i.e. pothead.Like I say the political satire in this film is sharp very sharp.The Homeland Security zealot (Rob Corddry) on the boys tail is someone who would not seem out of place in ""Animal House"" (if I may invoke a far funnier movie). He has one funny bit He thinks Harold and Kumar represent a new terrorist alliance of Al Qaeda and North Korea. But a little of his bug-eyed zaniness goes a long way.Since both Harold and Kumar are lovelorn in this film - each is seeking out a wayward girlfriend - we are meant to appreciate their newfound ""heart.""Its always a bad sign when goofball comics are required to display their soft side. Given the right material Cho and Penn are anarchically funny actors - and Penn in ""The Namesake"" proved himself to be much more than that - so the attempt here to make us misty-eyed sees entirely misplaced.So does the attempt to institutionalize them as some kind of generational Odd Couple or place their gonzo exploits in the real world of terrorism.To do that successfully youd need a new-style Terry Southern at the controls. Its certainly possible to make a post-9/11 comedy but it had better be a black one. Rated R for strong crude and sexual content graphic nudity pervasive language and drug use.

"Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay Joe Leydon Film Critic joeleydon 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 9 2008 | 0400PM PT An over-the-top and beyond-PC comedy that infuses party-hearty anarchy with hectoring moral outrage. Radical Muslim terrorists inbred Deep Southerners Homeland Security xenophobes and President George W. Bush are among the primary targets bruised and battered by the sledgehammering satire of ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" an over-the-top and beyond-PC comedy that sometimes deftly sometimes slapdashedly infuses party-hearty anarchy with hectoring moral outrage. An appreciably more politically charged follow-up to 2004s ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" (a piddling B.O. performer that nonetheless achieved cult-fave status on DVD) this raucous road-trip laffer set for an April 25 release should perform exceptionally well with auds primed by its predecessor. Whether the pic can attract newcomers to the franchise -and score breakthrough success during its theatrical run -- depends on the willingness of the masses to accept a sex-drugs-and-rock-n-roll comedy so jeeringly critical of post-9/11 paranoia and so openly contemptuous of authoritarian excesses by U.S. government agencies charged with waging the war on terror. Its like ""Animal House"" meets ""Dr. Strangelove"" -- although truth be told its highly unlikely even Stanley Kubrick would have dared attempt a scene like the one here in which an insanely overzealous Dept. of Homeland Security chief literally wipes his backside with the Bill of Rights. Not that the entire pic is a slapsticky scatological remix of a Keith Olbermann tirade. Indeed long stretches are simply variations of comic riffs from the first ""Harold amp; Kumar"" misadventure. Once again Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) pot-toking twentysomethings with drastically dissimilar degrees of ambition set out on a cross-country quest fueled by their taste for Cannabis. Also once again the buddies manage to subvert stereotypes (even while playing them for laughs) during close encounters with strangers who range from seriously weird to downright dangerous. And yes once again the boys cross paths with Neil Patrick Harris who takes unseemly delight in playing himself as a drug-consuming sexaholic who exploits his ""Doogie Howser"" fame at every opportunity. The big difference this time is that instead of seeking a beloved burger joint Harold and Kumar are on the run because after being mistaken for terrorists while aboard an Amsterdam-bound plane and getting shipped off to Guantanamo Bay they miraculously escape and flee to Florida. From there they must somehow make their way to Texas and seek help from Harolds politically well-connected former classmate (Eric Winter) -- who just happens to be preparing his wedding to Kumars former sweetheart (Danneel Harris). Ron Fox (Rob Corddry) the aforementioned Homeland Security chief with the personal hygiene problems leads the massive manhunt for the fugitives he assumes represent a link to a new nexus of Al Qaeda and North Korean terrorists. Corddry plays the wild-eyed zealot as a live-action cartoon who unthinkingly offends Jews blacks and marginally less rabid colleagues (including an increasingly frustrated Roger Bart) in the name of keeping America safe. In sharp contrast President Bush comes off as affably easygoing primarily because James Adomian plays him as a mild-and-hazy guy much like ... well Harold and Kumar. (It will be interesting to see which of these comic constructs incites the most vehement condemnation from right-wing bloggers and commentators.) Subtlety isnt the strong point of this free-wheeling farrago written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg scripters of the previous ""Harold amp; Kumar"" opus. Most of the gags are almost entirely apolitical and some of the biggest laughs are generated by brazenly gratuitous nudity sniggering sexual activity and considerable consumption of illicit drugs almost all of it with amusing consequences. A similar what-the-hell attitude permeates the entire pic While the production values are by no means sloppy there is little sign anyone involved perceived slickness as a goal worth pursuing. Here and there however the madcap zaniness and frat-house boisterousness are laced with something not unlike righteous rage about racial profiling extraordinary rendition and government-authorized oppression. Auds will be left feeling that if characters as harmless as Harold and Kumar (engagingly replayed by Cho and Penn) can wind up unfairly imprisoned even in the context of a broad comedy something is terribly wrong with the system. In its own wacky way ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" is one of the ballsiest comedies to come out of Hollywood in a long time. No kidding.
