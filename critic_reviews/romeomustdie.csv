Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr LOOK MA NO HANDS A chained-up Li hangs in there B- Romeo Must Die Genre Action/Adventure Mystery and Thriller; Starring Aaliyah Jet Li DMX; Director Andrzej Bartkowiak; Author Eric Bernt; Runtime (in minutes) 120; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted March 17 2000 -- 1200 AM EST Theres a great fight scene early in ""Romeo Must Die"" during which Han (Jet Li) a good ex-cop unjustly imprisoned in a Hong Kong jail breaks free even though hes surrounded by guards hung upside down by a chain around one foot and handcuffed. Jackie Chans got impishness Chow Yun-Fats got soul but 36-year-old Li with his mild gaze and perpetual whisper of a smile has got swiftness and grace. And the dignity and ingenuity with which he dispatches his tormentors and slips his bonds is a delight Every time Li does that thing he does ""Romeo"" is never more alive. So why does this action movie feel so handcuffed too? The story is serviceable enough. Han busts out and flies to Oakland because his younger brother has been murdered during skirmishes between Asian and black gangs trying to control the waterfront. Suave Han (who given Lis linguistic proficiency speaks English with none of the effort visible on the faces of fellow students Chan and Chow) meets Trish (recording star Aaliyah powder-fresh in her movie acting debut) not knowing the two have something in common His father (Henry O) and her father (Delroy Lindo) are the commanders-in-chief of these wars. But well-known cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak (he worked with Li on ""Lethal Weapon 4"") plays it so safe in his directing debut that sparks sputter rather than fly. Theres minimum daring minimum mayhem minimum verve despite a pumped-up hip-hop soundtrack. Ive got no beef with Americas appropriation of Hong Kong-style action flicks as a genre. For every ""Face/Off"" its worth putting up with a dozen ""Replacement Killers."" (Only the mixmaster mentality of Hollywood could blend East-West black-white bio-techno sensibilities into such fascinating hybrids as ""The Matrix"" and ""Rush Hour."") Still ""Romeo Must Die"" doesnt take advantage of its own possibilities either as a hard-boiled gangland battle or as a soft-boiled interracial Shakespearean love story. O action producers where art thou? Take a cue from Jet Li sailing through space with unbounded dash. Hes here and hes ready to astonish. Dont leave him star-crossd.

Starring Jet Li. Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak. (R. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Vancouver vainly tries to stand in for Oakland in ""Romeo Must Die"" but nobody stands in for Jet Li. The guy already is something else. As long as the Chinese martial arts star is in action ""Romeo Must Die"" is an eyeful. There are ""The Matrix""-style flights-of-fancy fighting -- and thats no accident in this cross-cultural kung fu extravaganza. Li is a phenomenon. His flying feet figure in all the action strategically spotted throughout this movie -- and there are several surprise shocks as well -- but my favorite stunt occurs when Li hangs by a necktie out a window several stories up. The necktie is still attached to the throat of a loudmouth Li had warned he would get. On other occasions Li is strung up by one leg with his hands manacled and nonetheless manages to fight off five prison guards; he slips the belt off an attacking gang member and uses it against him before back-flipping from one level of a staircase to another; and a comic pickup game of football turns into an excuse for some beautiful flying action. Longtime cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak is the first-time director but the key credit belongs to producer Joel Silver who also produced ""The Matrix."" The family resemblance shows. When Li rises in a long leap and plants kicks on four opponents in a row it is a ""Matrix"" moment. Also amazing are quick bone- crunching X-ray shots of Lis victims a variation on the inside-the- body flashes of the damage inflicted in ""Three Kings."" Li is an outside-the-law hero who even smokes. He plays a Hong Kong policeman named Han who took a fall to protect his crime-syndicate family and ended up in prison. He escapes and comes to Oakland where his clan has settled to avenge his dead brother. ""Romeo Must Die"" is a variation on the Shakespearean warring clans love story with Chinese and African American mobsters vying for control of the Oakland waterfront (where a new football stadium is to be built but never mind). After some establishing shots in San Francisco what they call Oakland never quite gels. The flat gray light of Vancouver is a giveaway and a funny-looking bridge is the clincher. At first glance the rival Chinese and African American clans might seem a plausible substitute for Shakespeares Capulets and Montagues in ""Romeo and Juliet"" but its a stretch to squeeze the plot into this framework. After too many sidetracks a viewer may wonder why they bothered. It becomes someones ""concept."" Straight-ahead action would have been more than sufficient. While its easy to see how Li has become an international star in his Hong Kong action films (""Shaolin Temple"" and ""Once Upon a Time in China"" and their sequels) and he was an imposing villain in Mel Gibsons ""Lethal Weapon 4"" he is more than a martial arts champion albeit a legitimate one. In ""Romeo Must Die"" he can be playful soulful menacing self-mocking (on one occasion he pretends to be a deliveryman) but he is not the great lover. The ""Romeo and Juliet"" character he most resembles is Romeos high- spirited mercurial buddy Mercutio but I guess ""Mercutio Must Die"" wouldnt fly. The Juliet character Trish ODay () is played by pop singer Aaliyah. The daughter of waterfront boss Isaac ODay (effectively played by Delroy Lindo of ""The Cider House Rules"") who wants to go straight she jumps into a cab Han has boosted and the two are off and running. If the lovers are not exactly star-crossed she at least has a refreshing touch of arrogance which gives the character some spunk. Theres no question she falls for his moves. Li in action is what this film must be about (and its too bad it ducks an opportunity to let him dance). Han doesnt use a gun but at one point he does pick up a water cannon. The scene starts to seem pointless until Li flashes the cut-off hose as a weapon. The final showdown not only sets off sparks -- and has Li emerging from the flames -- it is spine-tingling when the audience realizes those ungodly screams are his. ..

In this it succeeds absolutely so while the films considerable downtime provides plenty of opportunity to notice that Jet Li in his first English-lingo starring vehicle scarcely ever speaks a line that is more than one sentence long Joel Silvers new production has been very shrewdly calibrated to attract Asian action addicts hip-hop fans and general audiences looking for that ""Matrix"" edge. Result looks to put the Warner Bros. release into heavy B.O. rotation with international and eventual video/DVD prospects looming very large. Hong Kong feet and fists mix it up with gangsta artillery in ""Romeo Must Die "" a style-drenched kick-butt music-fueled Kung hop actioner that assiduously devotes itself to devising the most dazzling and inventive martial arts sequences it can muster. In this it succeeds absolutely so while the films considerable downtime provides plenty of opportunity to notice that Jet Li in his first English-lingo starring vehicle scarcely ever speaks a line that is more than one sentence long Joel Silvers new production has been very shrewdly calibrated to attract Asian action addicts hip-hop fans and general audiences looking for that ""Matrix"" edge. Result looks to put the Warner Bros. release into heavy B.O. rotation with international and eventual video/DVD prospects looming very large. Drawing more upon the familiar plotting patterns of Hong Kong crime dramas than upon anything recognizably Shakespearean the patchwork story simmers in the competition duplicity betrayal and revenge between two families --black and Chinese -- caught on the fulcrum between their long-standing underworld habits and their desire to go legit. As it happens each clan is more afflicted by internal threats than it is by its official rival and both are egged on by an uber-villain in this case a Jewish entrepreneur willing to go to any lengths to conclude a deal for a new NFL stadium and franchise. Although the waterfront warfare angle is nothing new its sufficient to support the films raison detre which is to showcase the martial arts skills of longtime Hong Kong star Jet Li in a very hip and effects-enhanced context. Based on the success Li enjoyed in his U.S. debut ""Lethal Weapon 4"" producer Silver had an existing script tailored to Lis specifications in a way that plays perfectly to the performers strengths and minimizes his liabilities. Short (especially compared with his towering co-stars here) unassuming and sort of scruffy looking Li has never been a particularly charismatic figure and it remains to be seen how far he can go in American films. But hes great in the combat scenes and he can count himself very fortunate to have been so carefully groomed by a top producer almost in the way that stars were in the old studio days. Fateful chain of events kicks off when Po Sing the uppity rude son of Chinese crime lord Chu Sing (Henry O) is found lynched after having sparked a fracas at an Oakland hip-hop club. Rival underworld boss Isaak ODay (Delroy Lindo) who owns most of the East Bay shoreline that Chu Sing doesnt swears to the old man that no one in his organization was responsible and before Chu Sing can determine who killed his son who should appear on the scene but his other son Han Sing (Li) a former Hong Kong cop who went to prison so that his father and brother could escape and start a new life in the U.S. Hans escape from prison reps one of the pics action highlights. Strung upside down inside a ""beating room"" cell Han manages to fling and contort himself around so as to immobilize several guards a bit of stupendous physicality with a topper that will provoke collective cries of ""Awesome"" Upon delivering a decisive kick Hans victim is suddenly seen in vivid X-ray explicitly showing the devastating effect of the hit. This gambit is repeated twice more to especially rousing effect in the one-and-one combat finale. While just getting his feet wet in the Bay Area Han momentarily at the wheel of a taxi coincidentally meets Trish ODay (hip-hop star Aaliyah in a sprightly turn) the very self-possessed daughter of Isaak who runs a trendy clothing store but unwillingly has just been put under the protection of one of her fathers bodyguards the massive comically bumbling Maurice (Anthony Anderson). Developing a cutely innocent bond rather than anything deeply Romeo-and-Julietish the two run the risky gauntlet between the two warring factions overseen by their respective fathers while trying to figure out who killed Po and soon after Trishs kid brother Colin (DB Woodside). Despite the suspicion engendered by their mutual loss of sons the two patriarchs are actually at pains to get along since they are warily allied with sinister developer Vincent Roth (Eduardo Ballerini) in gobbling up the few remaining two-bit landowners along the bay to facilitate the construction of a new football stadium. Enforcing their bosses will when some deed-holders prove too independent are two ice-cold killers Mac (Isaiah Washington) and Kai (Russell Wong far more camera-friendly than Li) the latter of whom appears to be at least Hans equal with his hands and feet. Just getting by with his one-liners in English dialogue scenes (Hans three big dramatic showdowns with his father are conducted in subtitled Cantonese) Li comes into his own in the martial arts sequences which of course are contrived so as to mostly eliminate guns from the equation. Two interludes in which he overcomes heavy odds to dress down (in one case literally) Mac and Maurices crew -- once in a cramped passageway and another time on a football field -- are pretty funny in their calculated showmanship. More genuinely exciting is a car-and-motorcycle chase that concludes with Han  who will not lay a hand on a woman taking on a tough femme adversary (Lis very hot ""Black Mask"" co-star Francoise Yip -- misspelled in the credits as ""Francois"") by using a cooperative Trish as an effective human weapon. Inevitable showdown between Han and Kai is potent although follow-up in which arriving police completely ignore the departing Han and Trish is ludicrous. Vet lenser Andrzej Bartkowiak who worked with Li on ""Lethal Weapon 4"" invests his directorial debut with muscular energy and an appropriate dramatic impatience; the film never stops moving and its always a pleasure to watch. Beginning with a Warner Bros. logo that is colored by dark clouds rather than the usual fluffy white followed by the arresting front credits pic has a sleek  neo-noirish look thats complimented and enhanced for contempo audiences by a throbbing hip-hop song score that rarely goes away; album with 15 new tracks including one collaboration between Aaliyah and featured player DMX is certain to be big. Martial arts ace Corey Yuen a frequent Li cohort designed the fab combat scenes which feature extensive wire work and enhancing effects from Manex Visual Effects which handled ""The Matrix."" Stunt coordinator/second unit director Conrad Palmisano also deserves kudos. Bay Area locations were mostly replicated in Vancouver.
