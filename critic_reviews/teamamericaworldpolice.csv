Shades of Takeshi Kitano Johnnie To and any number of cop movies stalk ""Police"" a funky riff with a Turkish twist on the hard-boiled genre movie. Clever wheeze by debutant writer-director Onur Unlu is to cast respected theater/film veteran Haluk Bilginer (channeling Ugo Tognazzi) as the unconventional cop rather than as a younger actor. Result a moderate success locally could work as a midnight fest curio. Bilginer plays sixtysomething Musa Rami who should be readying for retirement but has decided to take on the highly connected Izmitli gang which makes his cop colleagues extremely nervous. At the same time hes fallen secretly in love with young sociology student Funda (Ozgu Namal). As Rami has cancer and only two months to live he has nothing to lose on either a professional or family front. Unlu who dedicates the film to ""Kitano and my mother"" isnt interested in replicating Asian movies hard-driven style. Pics low-key appeal (and humor) comes from its relaxed everyday style which is constantly punctuated by weird happenings or Ramis own maverick actions. Technically pic is fine though post-synched dialogue is very forward. PoliceTurkey ProductionA MedyaVizyon release of an Eflatun Film production. (International sales Eflatun Istanbul.)

I understand this ranks me as a reactionary running-dog and impressionable delinquent - but at least I kept the chair clean. The missing - and debatably sarcastic - link between Washingtons special-ops ideal and Gerry Andersons prelapsarian Thunderbirds Team America are a cracked terrorist-fighting task force whose defiance of WMD-toting mullahs tends to leave the likes of Paris and the Pyramids wasted anyway. Trey Parker and his South Park accomplice Matt Stone sift through this ostensible contradiction in the accompanying rock anthem America Fuck Yeah More candid than the sniggering schoolboy politics is Parkers justifiable pride in how his painstaking (and often painstakingly crude) puppetry shows up the human performers in live-action Jerry Bruckheimer-style jingoist extravaganzas as elaborated in the serenade I Miss You (And Pearl Harbor Sucked). Team America recruit a Broadway heartthrob to infiltrate the evil-doers and discover a fifth column of hand-wringing Hollywood liberals in league with North Koreas crazed leader Kim Jong II. Better sustained than the South Park movie Team America delivers both spot-on movie deconstruction and gleeful destruction. It also teaches that there are different levels of piss-taking. The film might send up American war-mongers cartoonish world-view - a world of dicks pussies and assholes - but the jokes still on the pussies.

A more appropriate comparison would have been to the work of singer Toby Keith. Puppet Government South Park Creators Left Jab at Jingoism May Backfire By Hank Stuever Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 15 2004; Page C01 Nothing escapes the cruel and frequently spot-on abuse of ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone Jesus Christ has taken his lumps right along with Saddam Hussein rednecks Satan the PTA innumerable celebrities and unctuous politicians. And do not forget poor silent Kenny who died over and over for ""South Parks"" perpetual sin of crossing the line. But as we all know it takes more to cross that line now. Its going to take puppets on strings -- puppets who abuse their superpowers wreak havoc on world affairs splatter Janeane Garofalos brains on the wall and force subordinates into performing oral sex. Parker and Stones new offensive blast ""Team America World Police"" is a profane and sometimes bitingly funny sociopolitical-musical-action-adventurical story told entirely with clumsy marionettes (and two kittens) performing in a 1/3-scale post-9/11 world. Marionettes destroy the Eiffel Tower to save it from terrorists in ""Team America World Police"" the satirical blast by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. (Melinda Sue Gordon - Paramount Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  Team America Details  Watch the Trailer  Feature Puppet Love  Latest Movie Openings  Fall Film Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Todays Headlines amp; ColumnistsSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Breaking News AlertsSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now The movie -- shot in the manner of those short-lived 1960s-style Saturday-morning puppet melodramas -- is a testament to the deeply dissociative powers of American entertainment consumers Whatever anxieties and tragic losses have been caused by terrorists its all a big joke here. Its a wonder that some people in a fit of pop sobriety actually declared the death of cynicism and irony after the World Trade Center attacks. If by now youre not ready to laugh off the state of the world then ""Team America"" will make you feel very unhip indeed. When the men and women of Team America jet out of Abraham Lincolns mouth or Teddy Roosevelts head (they HQ at Mount Rushmore) in the name of ""Top Gun"" liberty the rest of the world only suffers Out to stop a decidedly Osama-looking terrorist and his swarthy al Qaeda-like hoods in Paris the Team unwittingly blows up the Eiffel Tower which falls over and crushes the Arc de Triomphe which leads to an explosive leveling of the Louvre. Mission almost accomplished (and with one Team member dead) the heroes declare victory and leave the stereotypical French (a mime a boy in a sailor suit women in sunglasses) agape at the destructive price of freedom. A replacement Team member Gary is recruited from his current job on Broadway singing the lead role in ""Lease The Musical"" a sufficiently mean sendup of the schmaltzy and now outdated ""Rent"" ""Everybodys got AIDS"" Gary sings while the rest of the cast dancing on scaffolding upbeatly sing ""AIDS AIDS AIDS"" and a sold-out marionette audience bounces in time and gets weepy. Mr. Spottswoode the Teams Leslie Nielsen-esque leader convinces Gary that his acting skills are needed to infiltrate a band of Islamic terrorists in Cairo. Gary reluctantly joins (thanks mainly to a parody of one of those horrible Alan Jackson patriotic ballads ""Freedom isnt free / Theres a hefty [bleepin] fee""). Back at Mount Rushmore the Teams victory cocktail party (and a graphic marionette-on-marionette sex scene that makes you wonder if the MPAA has just given up on Parker and Stone at this point) is interrupted by yet another terror attack this one at the Panama Canal. Asked to explain this the Teams surfer-voiced supercomputer Mr. I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. can only offer the excuse that he got bad intelligence. Turns out the real terrorist mastermind is Kim Jong Il who gets the same hilarious treatment that Parker and Stone so presciently bestowed upon Saddam Hussein in their 1999 movie ""South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut."" (And if youre wondering that movie was much better than this one.) The North Korean dictator speaks in the voice of ""South Parks"" Eric Cartman (if you dont know it ask any 11-year-old to do it for you then turn on your TVs V-chip) only with an Engrish accent. ""Im so ronery"" Kim confesses in a pitiful ballad to himself which explains his evil-doing -- he just needs to be ruvved. Here observant ""South Park"" fans will begin to suspect that the ingenious song stylings of the Parker/Stone canon are waning. Kim has wisely aligned himself with the Hollywood members of the Film Actors Guild (FAG) who in their lefty peacemaking zeal have unwittingly and arrogantly become part of his plan for world destruction. Its up to Team America to save the day -- if only they can defeat the rabid celebs including Alec Baldwin Helen Hunt Tim Robbins and an apparently brain-damaged Matt Damon. This is all terrifically nasty and shocking stuff and the puppetry and carefully handcrafted sets are a quaint wonder to behold against the glut of computer-created landscapes in other movies. Stunned by all the fun I am almost moved to salute Parker and Stone for their nuanced and careful takedown of American jingoism and the seemingly disastrous foreign policy that Team America stands for. Only that isnt quite how it played to an audience on Tuesday night at one of those free-ticket radio station giveaway previews in a packed cineplex in Northwest Washington. The biggest laughs came when ""Team America"" assaulted any and all concepts of ethnicity or when the joke was on gays Michael Moore or a vast left-wing idiocy. The movie feels like an elaborate inside joke on the very Americans laughing hardest at its easiest gags oblivious to the sly allegorical digs at a USA brand of bravado. What I took as a lampoon of Bushworld seemed to be received in the seats around me as a triumph of Bushworld. Pollsters and campaign workers take note ""Team America"" will only further confound your election-year data. Team America World Police (98 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for incredibly naughty language puppet sex puppet gore and extreme violence.

All this and more make up Team America World Police a gleeful politically incorrect melange of mischief and mockery created by the overgrown adolescents who brought the world South Park. Superhero to the rescue A Cybill Shepherd-esque Lisa battles terrorists in Team America World Police. Paramount Pictures The movie is neither animated like their last very funny full-length feature South Park Bigger Longer Uncut nor live action like their amateurish early comedy Orgasmo. And its satirical targets range from the substantive (terrorism hysteria) to the silly (overblown action flicks). But its casting is singularly original. The ""world police"" are a quintet of puppets (in a parody of the British television show The Thunderbirds) and there are marionette equivalents for outspoken actors such as Alec Baldwin Sean Penn Helen Hunt Tim Robbins Samuel L. Jackson Susan Sarandon Janeane Garofalo and George Clooney. (None of them look or sound much like their real-life counterparts but Stone and Parker never have been hung up on verisimilitude.) About the movie Team America World Police    (out of four) Voices Trey Parker Matt Stone Kristen Miller Masasa Daran Norris Phil Hendrie Directors Trey Parker Distributor Paramount Rated R for graphic crude and sexual humor violent images and strong language all involving puppets Opens Friday nationwide Theres also a puppet version of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il hellbent on destroying the world with his weapons of mass destruction while staging a world peace summit for which he enlists the involvement of the actors mentioned above. While Baldwin is yammering away about peace the North Korean dictator intends to blow up the planet. The world police intervene to thwart his plan. Some will relish Parker and Stone telling celebrities to shut up -- in the most extreme fashion. And many may cheer for what happens to documentary filmmaker Michael Moore. But others might laugh more when they see the inept American team attempt to catch terrorists but succeed only in blowing up the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. Presumably the teams botched plan to save France and nab the terrorists is a commentary on U.S. action in Iraq. Plenty more is simply sophomoric The actors collective is called the Film Actors Guild or F.A.G. and Baldwin as the guilds president spouts such lines as ""Spreading peace its the F.A.G. thing to do."" The vomiting scene out-spews even the portly Mr. Creosotes barf-fest in The Meaning of Life. But the money shot is the Kama Sutra-inspired variations of puppet sex. Team America also is a musical with songs that are jingoistic offensive and weirdly funny. No one could accuse Parker and Stones lyrics of predictability ""I miss you more than Michael Bay missed the mark in Pearl Harbor/I need you more than Ben Affleck needs acting lessons."" In Lease The Musical a chorus of actors gather to sing ""Everyone has AIDS/The pope has got it and so do you/Come on everybody we got a lot of quilting to do."" Parker and Stones position on the political spectrum is murky so all sides get skewered. And maybe thats the point. Team America is not as funny as the South Park movie and some of its juvenile humor falls flat. But when Team America works it falls squarely into the category of guilty pleasure.

"Team America puppets vs. the world. Slate Sign In Sign Up Team America puppets vs. the world. Team America puppets vs. the world. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 14 2004 718 PM Strings Attached The puppets of Team America skewer the right. If only theyd stopped there. By David Edelstein Jerry Bruckheimer not Kim Jong-il is the real target Week after week Trey Parker and Matt Stones South Park is emblematic of the very best of American culture. Consider the ferociously subversive iconoclasm that tumbles from the mouths of its juvenile dramatis personae and the exuberant deconstruction of specious bourgeois sitcom homilies. The crude animation much maligned brilliantly distills and exteriorizes its makersWeltanschauung. Also I really love the talking/singing poop that leaves big splotches of shit wherever it lands. So I was up-up-up for Parker and Stones Team America World Police(Paramount). The title alone rocks It tells you that the movie is a stink bomb lobbed at American arrogance and overweening militarism. Thatll piss off the right And the open letter to Parker and Stone from lefty peacenik Sean Penn decrying their anti-left irreverence at a time of international crisis That was promising too. Give em points for stirring up bipartisan outrage. Advertisement But the real politics here are anti-Jerry Bruckheimer. Parker and Stone have called Team America a ""Bruckheimer movie with marionettes"" and beat by beat the picture is patterned on jingoist Reagan-era contraptions like Top Gun (1985). Its got the maverick-hero-with-the-guilty-buried-trauma-backstory-resulting-in-emotional-blockage-that-must-be-manfully-overcome template. Its got the soap opera triangle that rears its stupid head even in the middle of apocalyptic action sequences. Its got the turning point where the despairing hero wanders the streets to a soul-filling Ramp;B tune recovers his skills in a montage of training scenes (with a hard-rock backbeat) and goes mano a mano with the bad guy in the name of the father figure who recruited him and the sultry babe who believes in him. Its got the final face-off that comes at the emotional blockage with a gargantuan plunger. Whats different is that yes the hero is a puppet and you can see his strings. And hes not a fighter pilot hes a Broadway actor recruited by a Charlton Heston-like figure with an omnipresent highball to save the world with his ACTING by infiltrating an Islamic terrorist group. But thats hard because his ACTING once got his brother beaten to death by gorillas--and Im sorry if Im spoiling that revelation but there are so many more all doozies. Theres marionette sex hardcore with positions even I didnt know and marionette puking which is also in its way hardcore. Theres spectacular marionette-on-marionette violence--really splattery decapitations and disembowelings. The hero has a soulful number where he croons that he misses his girl ""as much as director Michael Bay missed the mark"" with Bruckheimers sucky Pearl Harbor (2001). The back-in-action montage is more or less straight except its scored with a song called ""We Need a Montage."" Real-life politics occasionally elbow showbiz ones aside--but just barely. In the first sequence the paramilitary Team America--two hot chicks and three studly guys--goes after Islamic terrorists in Paris and ends up incinerating the Louvre to keep a terrorist from detonating a bomb inside a nice jab at the blow-em-up-to-save-em school of occupation. But after Team America destroys the Panama Canal the movies target shifts from crazed militarism to left-wing peacenik anticorporate sanctimoniousness in the person of Michael Moore and a bunch of actors led by Alec Baldwin--all of whom cozy up to North Koreas megalomaniacal Kim Jong-il in the name of world peace. (SouthPark fans will recognize Kims voice as belonging to that great blob of id Cartman with all the rs turned into ls.) Thats the part that has Sean Penn wringing his hands and must have puzzled a lot of people who assume that Parker and Stone with their toilet talk and blasphemy and camp sensibility are flaming lefties. But theyre not; theyre Cato Institute-level libertarians. They actually hate liberals as much if not more than their right-wing counterparts. The biggest surprise in Team America is that theres no Barbra Streisand to kick around (or disembowel or decapitate). Hey this anti-Bush liberal has no problem in principle with both sides getting skewered. But when Alec Baldwin Sean Penn Tim Robbins Susan Sarandon and Janeane Garofolo moronically align themselves with Kim Jong-il and start wielding automatic weapons against Team America well ... Leftist actors learned from Vietnam not to cozy up to dictators Jane Fonda one of the best actresses of her generation hasnt worked in more than a decade. And its the left at the moment using Kim Jong-il to hammer Bush about making pre-emptive strikes only against countries with oil fields--as opposed to those that actually have weapons of mass destruction and are run by people nutty enough to use them. And Michael Moore wouldnt be a suicide bomber because he thinks too highly of his indispensability. Sorry boys This just isnt very incisive left-bashing. I laughed all the way through Team America Scene by scene its uproarious and the climactic monologue that builds a theory of geopolitics (and life) around the interaction of ""dicks pussies and assholes"" ought to be chiseled in the entry hall of the United Nations. The marionette work and production design are an amazing blend of the crude and the intricately beautiful. But the thing about the best SouthPark episodes is that theyre profound. There was one that took on John Edward the guy who claims to talk to the dead thats a magnificent summation of the skeptical worldview--in 23 minutes. There are others on that genius level. Team America on the other hand boils down to some movie parodies and a lot of nyah-nyah infantile feces-hurling. And really Havent we had enough of that this political season? David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Starring Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Directed by Trey Parker. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Team America World Police"" Matt Stone and Trey Parker the creators of the hilarious ""South Park"" movie take on the war on terror using marionettes to satirize politicians and activists across the political spectrum. Surprisingly the results are embarrassing. As puppetry ""Team America"" is stilted. As satire its gutless and lazy. And as comedy it barely delivers laughs. To satirize something it really does help to know that something inside- out. But ""Team America"" is neither inspired by nor operating from any kind of insight. Rather it seems based on a cultivated self-satisfied ignorance a reflexive mockery that comforts itself by seeing everything as one big joke. It neither talks truth to power nor pierces the pretensions of people who think they do. Rather it mumbles nonsense like a pothead giggling over a news broadcast. Stone and Parker are taking on water from the first scene in which terrorists have smuggled a suitcase nuke into Paris and are about to blow up the city. Maybe someone is comically gifted enough to find the humor in this situation but not these guys. Team America shows up -- a true-blue band of square-jawed men and lethal beautiful women -- and do battle with the terrorists. ""Put down the weapon of mass destruction and get on the ground"" one of them says. The joke falls flat. Stone and Parker want to be equal-opportunity bashers. And so they mock the aggressiveness of American patriots whod destroy half of Paris in order to save it just as they mock naive liberals who think everything can be solved through compromise and concession. The problem is that the filmmakers dont really understand either point of view. Insulated by what seems to be smugness they merely trivialize the administrations war on terrorism just as they misrepresent the politics of real-life Hollywood liberals such as Alec Baldwin Sean Penn and Tim Robbins. Within this framework both a paranoid right-wing operative and Michael Moore can be presented as idiots not because either is wrong but because both actually care. Theyre not cool enough for apathy. The irony is that Stone and Parker really do care about something in ""Team America"" something they know much more about than the topic theyre satirizing. They care about popular culture. They know the conventions of action movies. And so they string together the movie cliches and try to milk them for laughs. Gary (the voice of Parker) an actor is recruited by a covert government agency and assigned to go to the Middle East posing as a terrorist. At first he doesnt want to go but after a visit to the Lincoln Memorial and an interlude of corny country music on the soundtrack he decides to risk it all for his country. Unfortunately the action-movie parody keeps running headlong into the grim topic of international terrorism which will not soften for silly jokes. On his first assignment Gary walks into a bar in Cairo introduces himself and says ""Im a terrorist. Anyone know of any terrorist attacks coming up?"" Its supposed to be funny but whats funny about it? That someone could be so stupid? The characters not defined enough for us to notice. That the filmmakers have the nerve to make a joke about terrorism? Thats not enough. While the animatronic faces of the marionettes are expressive the bodies can barely move a limitation that the filmmakers try to find comedy in. But the only real laughs are vulgar A scene of a marionette vomiting in the street and another of marionette eroticism. The plot is mishmash involving plans by Korean strongman Kim Jong Il to join with terrorists and blow up the worlds major cities. Hollywood actors -- members of the Film Actors Guild (F.A.G.) -- also become involved. They travel to Hong Kong espousing ""talk and reasoning"" as the solution to world terrorism. ""That is the FAG way."" Theres nothing honestly observed or politically astute about any of this. Its all just a mess with scenes of Susan Sarandon shooting a machine gun at Special Forces guys and soldiers laying waste to everything. At a certain point it seems that Stone and Parker may actually have a message to impart and thats when it gets real scary -- something about there being three kinds of people in the world etc. Theres no nice word for this. Its idiocy. I cringe at the thought of other countries seeing ""Team America"" and thinking were all this ridiculous. -- Advisory This film contains strong language marionette gore and multiple marionette sex acts.

Parents do not listen to your impressionable kids begging you to take them to this movie. Its not even close to a good idea. But for anyone who can handle a movie that doesnt just go into the gutter but unearths new subterranean canals below it this is wickedly funny and devilishly subversive. It is satire at its most fearless. Not subtle in the manner of Swift. Crude in the sense of ""American Pie."" In fact cruder. And yet dead on target. Puppets Joe Gary Chris Lisa and Sarah are on patrol in the very politically incorrect yet oh-so-funny satire ""Team America World Police"" from TVs ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. (Melinda Sue Gordon -- Paramount Pictures) _____More in Movies_____  Team America Details  Watch the Trailer  Feature Puppet Love  Latest Movie Openings  Fall Film Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now What is that target? Plain old couch-potato us and our perception of the post-9/11 world thanks to a composite prism of fear cultural ignorance and government spin. Filmmakers Trey Parker and Matt Stone creators of ""South Park"" are holding up a mirror to our worst sides and making us laugh hysterically for the privilege. Did I mention theyre all puppets? Thats the funniest element of all the spectacle of these characters (from turbaned terrorists to stiff upstanding members of Team America) moving around with literal and figurative woodenness. Their faces are fixed. Their strings show. But the words that come out of their mouths imbue them with an out-there liveliness. Team America consists of commando-style gung-ho special-ops well puppets. When we meet them they are storming Paris on the trail of terrorists. Their helicopter swoops above a man in a turban carrying a briefcase. ""You in the robes"" booms the Team America loudspeaker. ""Put down the weapon of mass destruction and get on the ground."" What follows is a ""Mission Impossible""-style shoot-em-up which leaves Paris devastated by Team Americas shoulder-fired missiles (including the toppled Eiffel Tower) and the teams apparent satisfaction at another successful mission completed. ""We stopped the terrorists"" announces Team America to the stunned terrified citizenry. The team is now a man short (his William Shatneresque death speech is hilarious by the way) so group leader Spottswoode (voice of Daran Norris) recruits . . . a Broadway actor. His name is Gary (voiced by Parker) and hes fresh from a triumphant stage musical about AIDS called ""Lease."" His acting they reason will help him infiltrate the bad guys. Garys new teammates include a clairvoyant named Sarah (Masasa) who claims to sense everything even though the evidence is usually staring her in the face; stud and ex-quarterback Joe (Parker again) who has terrible luck with the babes; and Lisa (Kristen Miller) who finds herself attracted to the new actor-agent. Their mission is to trot the globe in search of bad guys and WMDs but the real evil it turns out is closer to home. Were talking about an American group that wants to thwart Team Americas noble aims at every turn The Film Actors Guild or by their oft-cited acronym F.A.G. Their leading lights? The usual crowd Alec Baldwin Martin Sheen Sean Penn Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. Thats the thing about Parker and Stone They go for the taboo with such confidence and irony they give you a wicked glimpse of a lighter side. Thus when we see Arab and North Korean terrorists all of them muttering in ethnically pejorative accents (including ""axis of evil"" leader Kim Jong Il who speaks in obscenity-laced Charlie Chan-accented English) its not about racial derision. (Although clearly Parker and Stone are mischievously probing the audiences politically incorrect sense of humor.) Its a satire about all too many perceptions of the World Out There as a bunch of ""haters"" with funny accents. And in Garys musical one of the ensembles chipper numbers goes ""Everyone is dead from AIDS"" It may not sound funny here but in context its satirically hilarious. It would be amiss not to mention again that ""Team America"" is riddled with obscenity and extremely low-rent humor that will curl almost anyones hair. When one puppet gets sick from a night of partying he pukes. And pukes. And pukes. And as for the movies flashpoint scene -- a lovemaking session between two marionettes that had be trimmed to avoid an NC-17 rating -- Id be dishonest if I didnt confess I laughed so hard I made little moaning noises. Guess those teachers were right. TEAM AMERICA WORLD POLICE (R 98 minutes) -- Contains puppet sex puppet violence and extremely graphic language. Oh yeah and major pukeage. Area theaters.

Its no surprise then that ""Team America World Police"" goes the extra mile to piss off everybody literally and figuratively. Anyone who saw ""South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut"" knows that Trey Parker and Matt Stone revel in milking every ounce out of an ""R"" rating as well as bludgeoning jokes into the ground. Its no surprise then that ""Team America World Police"" goes the extra mile to piss off everybody -- which includes gleefully destroying renowned Hollywood liberals literally and figuratively. All told the clever visual bits and hilarious songs dont entirely compensate for the many flat or beyond-over-the-top spells. Still in an election season ripe for parody pic could offer a tonic to youthful cynics unlikely to gag on its pungency. The MPAA has certainly done its part to help market the film The tussle to avoid an ""NC-17"" rating for sex involving genitalia-free puppets generated plenty of publicity. The truth is its hard to imagine the debated scene being much more acrobatic than it is but that wont prevent the unrated DVD from being a hot commodity. Always fond of toppling sacred cows Parker and Stone score big points for the sheer audacity of tackling the war on terror using two-foot-tall puppets that resemble the marionettes on ""Thunderbirds"" -- and they manage to spoof the conventions of Bruckheimer-produced action yarns in the process. Still the challenge of mixing political satire with being as lewd and crude as possible represents a balancing act that the duo has never fully mastered. In ""South Park"" they create enough genuinely funny moments to obscure (especially for a core audience that appreciates immaturity) creative deficiencies and a commitment to excess thats more apparent here. ""Team America"" certainly opens well as the elite terrorism-fighting unit housed in Mt. Rushmore goes after a gang of bad guys in Paris destroying global landmarks with an appalling lack of concern. The face-off includes a riotous martial arts fight where the puppets (whose strings are always visible) bounce around a lot but never really strike each other. With one of their number lost in that operation the group recruits an actor named Gary (currently starring in ""Lease The Musical"") to infiltrate the terrorist organization. At the same time however this move unsettles relationships on the team. Meanwhile North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il (like Gary voiced by Parker in a manner that wont win many friends among Asian-American groups) plots his own diabolical scheme. His quest for global domination hinges on manipulating the Film Actors Guild (an acronym thats funny maybe the first three times but not the next three dozen) to lobby for peace with Alec Baldwin Tim Robbins and Martin Sheen among those not-so-gently lampooned. Clearly Parker and Stone (who wrote the script with Pam Brady another ""South Park"" producer) have soaked in the action genre yet much of their parody hews so closely to the real thing that the pic goes relatively long stretches without laughs. Periodically the songs come to the rescue. As in the ""South Park"" feature the songs deliver the movies biggest highlights. Atop the song list sits the stirring embarrassingly catchy anthem ""America Fk Yeah"" which repeats in much the way the theme of the old ""He-Man"" animated series was trotted out each time the protagonist underwent his superheroic metamorphosis. Inasmuch as they occasionally speak through ""South Parks"" Cartman character whose memorable phrases include ""Democrats piss me off"" it shouldnt come as a shock that the left fares a bit worse than the right here though a climactic speech skewers both. And while seeing Michael Moore obliterated doubtless will amuse more than just the filmmakers harshest detractors its reasonable to ask how many stars (or marionette imitations of them) have to be torn asunder before the audience gets the point. At a more fundamental level ""Team America"" is a true technical achievement recreating a dizzying array of sets and costumes at one-third scale and clearly having plenty of fun doing so -- down to using housecats as stand-ins for terrifying panthers. In a sense Parker and Stones latest foray unwittingly provides the perfect metaphor for their work While there are moments to like they invariably come with strings attached.
