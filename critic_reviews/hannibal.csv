But hes on the FBIs Ten Most Wanted list and horribly mutilated millionaire Mason Verger (Oldman) Lecters sole surviving victim has put a reward on his head. When Hannibal learns that his old acquaintance Clarice Starling (Moore) is being stitched up by her bosses at the Bureau hes sufficiently sure of his secret life to write to her; but he hasnt bargained for cop Pazzi (Giannini) who has his doubts about the curator. The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew thats enjoyably spicy but low on substance. So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little times left for analysis or characterisation. Moore is impressive but saddled with the straight role Hopkins ambles through Giannini is engagingly morose and Oldman manages to strike a fine balance between witty pastiche and wry pathos aware that this grandiose Guignol is hokum. The bloated classical score suits Harriss pretensions while Scott wisely keeps things brisk and delivers the set pieces. Lip smacking fun its an improvement on the book but its never as rigorous insightful or compelling as Manhunter.

(Phil Bray/MGM) I suppose you could say ""Hannibal"" is exactly what you deserve. I mean here you are coming back for more desperate to see the sequel of a movie that was about cannibalism. What does that say about your deep-seated desires? Do you tremble at the prospect of human flesh being devoured? Hmmm Clarice? Well here it is. The much-anticipated adaptation of Thomas Harriss novel in which FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) finds herself back in the eager hands of Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) who has decided to come out of retirement. In case you didnt see ""Silence of the Lambs"" this is a rematch between Starling (played in the original by Jodie Foster) and Lecter who became uneasy allies when she sought his assistance in tracing a psychopathic killer. It seems Lecter had a taste for . . . his own species. When we last heard from him he was having an old friend for dinner  literally. In ""Hannibal"" the dear old fellow is living in Italy looking very Truman Capote in that lovely hat. What reason could these two opponents have to encounter each other again? It takes a vindictive little chess game orchestrated by one of the doctors surviving victims. This individual (played by Gary Oldman made up to suggest a melted Muppet) uses a wheelchair and lives in a magnificent home near Washington. His face is a hideous mass of fleshy pulp the horrible result of a date gone wrong with Lecter all those years ago. Hes a wounded Elephant Man who dreams of revenge. When he learns that Starling has been unfairly victimized thanks to a botched FBI raid he decides to use her vulnerability as bait. After all Lecter was rather fond of Clareeeeesssssssse. It should be pretty clear to everyone whether theyve read the Harris novel or not that ""Hannibal"" is hellbound for a gruesome denouement. And if you have read the book you can expect some radical departures from the Harris story particularly at the end. In the interest of preserving surprise I shouldnt say much more; but even by its own dark standards the movies conclusion is as dramatically dissatisfying as it is disturbing. ""Hannibal"" dies from its own auto-asphyxiation. By the time it draws to a hideous close you feel dirty for even watching. For the first half of the movie however you watch with moderate interest thanks to the combined efforts of director Ridley Scott and scriptwriters Steven Zaillian and David Mamet. Moores contribution is vital. An underrated actor she lends this role much more heft than it deserves. And her performance makes that perfectly structured alabaster face even more alluring. But whats best about this movie  and the reason there has been so much interest in Harriss book and the movie  is the creation of a great character. Hannibal Lecter who has entered the culture as a boogeyman for our time is a moral avenging angel in a reverse sort of way. He doesnt eat or kill just anyone. He does have standards. If people try to take advantage of him  as about half a dozen unscrupulous unfortunate characters discover in this movie  well hes not going to be lenient. Hopkins who is electrifying in almost anything he does reprises the mastery he brought to ""Silence of the Lambs."" Even in a movie as patchworky as this hes always compelling. He is completely in command of his presence if that makes sense. He knows how to make the most of himself on screen which is enough to make you follow him through anything  even this. Unfortunately youll probably hate yourself for doing so. ""Hannibal"" (R 131 minutes )  Contains gruesome violence some nudity and strong language.

(Phil Bray/MGM) Its not easy being Hannibal Lecter these days. The old fop simply wants to kick back in a cafe near the Palazzo Vecchio with a nice Chianti and spend the hours fondly remembering the kind of dismembering when death was slow and oh so mellow. But a nasty billionaire who looks like E.T. with leprosy is paying millions to smoke him out and turn him into a Big Mac for three not-so-little pigs. Thats pretty much it for Ridley Scotts ""Hannibal"" which suffers from one fundamental flaw it cannot overcome It is not ""The Silence of the Lambs."" So if you want to see ""The Silence of the Lambs"" again the solution to your problem will be found at your local video shoppe. It will not be found in any of the thousand-odd theaters where Anthony Hopkinss elegant snobbish sociopath is playing an elaborate game of escape and evasion while occasionally testing new recipes. This movie connects with its predecessor exactly as Thomas Harriss book ""Hannibal"" did to his ""Silence of the Lambs"" It is not bad on its own terms and it is certainly engrossing but it comes nowhere near the power and sordid glory of the original. One must understand from the get-go that ""Hannibal"" lacks resonance because it is altogether a different type of story from the original. Where ""Silence"" was rooted in reality and had a detail-rich documentary feel that pushed its creepiness content off the charts while giving it a moral center ""Hannibal"" is Gothic opera with black-comic overtones set in a world utterly disconnected from our own a world without a center. Put it another way In ""Silence"" they killed us; in ""Hannibal"" to paraphrase Bugsy Siegel they only kill their own kind. This not just in Jodie Foster has been replaced by the superb actress Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling the heroic FBI agent whose presence oddly agitates Hannibal Lecters inner child. This was a business necessity based on Fosters decision not to participate in the project. Scott and the producers probably could have done no better than the excellent Moore. Yet her performance hamstrings the movie. Moore acts Foster was. Something about Fosters physical being and possibly even her personal history - her tumultuous past her near-androgyny her pale radiance her vulnerability enmeshed with her intelligence her icy blue eyes (the same color as Lecters) her strange angelicism - held the movie together. She was fascinating; you could certainly understand how a monstrous anomaly like Lecter could find her enchanting because you yourself found her enchanting. Moore by contrast is all business; its good business but its only business. She plays the older Clarice pretty much as Harris wrote her a tough street agent a steady hand in the raid van but perhaps shes seen too much bloodshed and feels too close to used up. But thats all. Theres nothing resonant or charismatic about her. Shes not a paradigm of innocence; shes not a symbolic protector of the lambs. There arent any lambs in the movie. The movie is also hamstrung by the structural oddities of the book It feels at times like the first half of one story and the second half of another. In the first half set largely in picturesque Florence Dr. Lecter has emerged under a thin pseudonym as ""Dr. Fell"" a Renaissance scholar bon vivant and epicure who is campaigning to obtain a chair as curator of an elegant museum in that fabled city. Why Florence? Well because Harris likes Florence and spent a lot of time there. No other reason but its helpful because Scott likes it too and really lights up the places lush atmosphere and gleaming cobblestones and enclosed bridges and vaulted ancient stone buildings. In this picturesque ruin a rumpled detective named Pazzi (played by the great Euro actor Giancarlo Giannini whose face has come to resemble Tuscan ceramics cracking in the sun since Roman times) has been alerted to the possibility of Lecters presence and begun to see through Dr. Fells false identity. But Pazzi pressured by a greedy young wife decides to use his police career as camouflage as he attempts to capture Lecter for the amusement of another recondite sociopath the fabulously wealthy Mason Verger back in the States. That will earn Pazzi a 3 million reward enough to keep his wife in opera tickets and Gucci shoes for years. And why is Mason Verger so ticked at Lecter? Possibly it has something to do with the fact that Lecter induced him to cut off his own face and then fed it to the doggies. Arf arf This is why Verger now resembles that alien with the skin problem. Seeking revenge he has conjured up a counterplot He will feed all of Hannibal to some hungry pigs feet first. Its not tit for tat its feet for face. Verger played by an uncredited Gary Oldman under a latex mask represents the movies curious transference of values. It finds forgiveness in its heart for Hannibal because he is so cool and elegant and knows the difference between a 78 Puligny-Montrachet and a 79 Chassagne-Montrachet; this means of course it must find a far more repugnant villain. So as it progresses we watch as Hannibal despite his adroit handling of the greedy Italian cop (memo to cops stalking Hannibal Lecter Stay away from high windows and short ropes) ceases to be the true villain and ultimately becomes almost a damsel in distress while Verger takes over as the prime nasty boy. Its a tricky transaction handled deftly for the most part though the movie makes one small fumble It locates Vergers evil mostly in his appearance and in the fey sly decadence that Oldman manages to convey under all that rubber with only vivid eyes and a voice that seems pickled in pain; yet it fails to display him doing something truly evil. (Harris in the book dreamed up some doozies for Mason Cruelest of all he enjoyed cocktails made in part from the tears of children whether shaken or stirred I cannot recall.) Thus the second half involves a somewhat bizarre plot The mega-rich Mason uses his political influence to put Agent Starlings career in jeopardy through the offices of a corrupt Justice Department official played by Ray Liotta who is all wrong for the part. Hes too boyish and lacks the gravitas and dead eyes of a true D.C. wonk-careerist. But Masons psychology is astute He knows that putting Clarice into danger will attract Lecter to her rescue. His minions succeed in netting the maniac where the now completely irrelevant Italian caper failed. At that point the movie gets pretty ordinary ending finally with a gun-laden one-gal hostage rescue mission meant to save Hannibal the Cannibal from the swine which involves some routine gunfighting (Moore never looks as comfortable with guns as Foster did in the final seconds of ""Silence""). And yes the ending has been changed but just barely. The book left our favorite fun couple together at last in swank and purely apposite circumstances. Scott and writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillian have cooked up a twist to that deflationary spiral. Possibly more important the movie has a talker. By that I mean a scene sure to be the chatter-center of America come Monday at the office. Its ""Hannibals"" dizziest wittiest most outlandish scene and also its most ghoulish and not for the faint of heart. This involves - hmm how can I say this? Possibly it is every Washington journalists most vivid fantasy not merely a meal with a spokesman a common if odious Washington ritual but a meal of a spokesman What keeps ""Hannibal"" from reaching the heights of intensity is the lack of stakes. Nothing really matters who lives who dies how why? You are amused by these cold self-interested but glamorous fish but they seem to swim in an aquarium sealed off from human life.""Hannibal"" (131 minutes) is rated R for some truly gruesome imagery.

Instead Anthony Hopkins famed gourmet has sauntered if not galloped to a calm and effete life in Florence Italy -- where they apparently dont air Americas Most Wanted. As he wickedly toys with an Italian cop who is starting to sniff out some clues the FBI agent Lecter practically mentored in The Silence of the Lambs is being unjustly hung out to dry. Julianne Moore is the older tougher and no longer interesting Clarice Starling who has been the key player in a D.C. drug bust that has left five dead including one of their own. Read more Video Hannibal Leaves a bitter aftertaste Photo Gallery Double take Related The replacements All but destined to cross paths again the two find a reunion catalyst in one of Lecters victims an unbilled and unrecognizable Gary Oldman under mounds of makeup that gives him a passing resemblance to Eric Stoltz in Mask. This vengeful creep whose child-molesting tendencies have been mercifully toned down from the book is hatching a plot to get Hannibal back home for a final dispatching involving trained killer pigs. None of them is as beastly as Ray Liottas character who works for the Justice Department and has been hitting on then backstabbing Clarice. Hes a key player in the movies climax which depending on your viewpoint will seem silly disgusting or even funny. It takes Lecters dining tastes to unprecedented tasteless levels but looks like a special effect. Screenwriters David Mamet and Schindlers Lists Steven Zaillian (buying prestige are we?) have wisely jettisoned the books absurdly dreadful final pages but also eliminated the Oldman characters bodybuilder lesbian sister who was pretty amusing. It probably doesnt matter either way because the basics are thoroughly botched. Hopkins Hannibal is no longer mysterious Clarice is no longer vulnerable and the overextended Florence scenes dash any hopes of early momentum even if Giancarlo Giannini is perfect as the cop. Even the opening shootout isnt staged with particular relish and thats something Jonathan Demme (1991s Lambs) and Michael Mann (1986s Manhunter) would certainly have gotten right. Both of those films hold up beautifully years after their making; the proof is in the deluxe DVD renderings they have received. Hannibal wont even be a footnote when the years best movies are grabbing the ink in December -- long after youve eaten the nine bucks it cost you to get in.

Starring Anthony Hopkins Julianne Moore. Directed by Ridley Scott. (VHS and DVD. R. 131 minutes.) There are disgusting movies that are worth seeing -- ""Silence of the Lambs"" for one -- and others that are merely disgusting. Then theres ""Hannibal."" This sequel to the Academy Award-winning ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a revolting experience. Yet it may be the most well-crafted piece of garbage this year. Director Ridley Scotts visual panache gives ""Hannibal"" a veneer of quality. Steven Zaillian and playwright David Mamet collaborated on the adaptation of Thomas Harris novel. And the cast -- Anthony Hopkins Julianne Moore Giancarlo Giannini -- is first-rate. The combination of these forces does more than create the illusion of worth. For about two-thirds of its running time ""Hannibal"" is darkly entertaining. But eventually the inherent flaws in the original material -- the faulty plot construction the giddy grossness -- get the better of ""Hannibal"" and quality goes out the window.sk0 Moore plays Clarice Starling replacing Jodie Foster. Clarices slimy boss (Ray Liotta) assigns her to track the fiends whereabouts. Hannibal being a man of taste and refinement lives in Florence in the Palazzo Capponi. For most of ""Hannibal"" Clarice sits in an FBI office trying to locate her old nemesis. The real action is in Florence where detective Pazzi (Giannini) figures out that ""Dr. Fall"" is really a diabolical criminal with a nasty eating disorder. Theres pleasure in seeing Hopkins adopt the high voice and piercing eyes of his Academy Award-winning role. But this time Hannibal is more of an aesthete than a monster so hes less interesting. Clarice is no longer a match for Hannibal. She can only be a spectator to horror. Ultimately ""Hannibal"" has nothing to say about the seductive powers of evil. Advisory Nudity and gruesome violence.

True the character who launched a decades worth of Chianti and fava-bean jokes is not bloody likely to become anyones candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. But that hardly means we arent rooting for him. In Hannibal Lecter the escaped monster now living in Italy under the courtly identity of a Renaissance scholar named Dr. Fell is pursued by a multiplicity of forces and he responds by attacking his enemies with a quicksilver ruthlessness so nimble that his very murderousness becomes a witty form of sleight of hand. The movie is nimble too. Adapted by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian from Thomas Harris 1999 novel Hannibal lacks the rounded emotional elegance of The Silence of the Lambs (that was a great film; this one is merely good) yet Scott a rapt technician coming off the rousingly square Gladiator now casts a grisly fairy-tale spell. Strolling through the ornate and cavernous streets of Florence a city that exudes the shadowy draped grandeur of a Gothic cathedral Lecter is followed by a pickpocket who has been hired to obtain his fingerprint - he isnt even supposed to capture the damn wallet - but the pickpocket might just as well be operating in shackles. He brushes up against Lecter and a second later as the wine-dark blood gushes horror and a kind of hushed admiration mingle in the audience like a sweet poison brew. The poor petty thug barely even knows what sliced him (or where hes been sliced). In Hannibal Lecter remains a riveting figure of fear never more so than when we catch a glimpse of prison-asylum video-surveillance footage in which he lunges with terrifying brio at the face of a nurse. But that fear is also the flip side of what we covet about him the lithe and effortless mastery of his spontaneous snuff glee. As the movie with its Internet-age sheen demonstrates you can record Lecters imprint or capture him on a video screen but you cant steal his soul which is timeless - wedded to the barbarity of antiquity. Here as in the earlier film the inspired feat of Hopkins performance isnt just the teasing joviality with which he gooses every encounter but the way that he delivers his most malicious lines with a kind of velvet-tipped love. ""Im giving very serious thought"" he purrs to one misbegotten soul ""to eating your wife."" As we think back on the lovely woman hes talking about and the way that Lecter had been flirting with her just minutes before his words seem less a threat than a perverse gift. For Lecter murder accompanied by his predilection for turning victims into snack meat is pure consummation - an affectionate and weirdly sane way of putting the human race in its place. Its a virtual redefinition of evil to be this nuanced and visionary a slasher this cool. Hannibal like Harris unjustly maligned novel is structured as a series of overlapping stalker-and-prey pursuits. Lecter in the 10 years that he has roamed free has never been far off the radar of Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) the tough but vulnerable FBI agent whos like his own private combination of Inspector Javert and Dantes Beatrice. At the moment however his most dogged pursuer is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) a filthy-rich convicted pedophile who is the only one of Lecters 14 known victims to have survived. Verger whose face is a skinless bubbly maw of waxen gray flesh (the flashback that explains how he got that way has a shuddery ickiness) looks like he could be Michael Jackson in about 15 years and Oldman delivering his lines with the ironically tweedy good cheer of a malevolent Jimmy Stewart plays him as a kind of wormy sicko Elephant Man - a barely breathing accident seething with vengeance. Vergers plan is to capture Lecter and feed him live to an army of giant woolly carnivorous pigs. The intriguing prospect of Lecter getting his just desserts gave the book much of its sadistic drive but Scott doesnt sustain the ominousness of the threat with enough fanfare. The Lecter-in-Florence section however is superb with Giancarlo Giannini urgent and flustered as the Italian police detective who launches a doomed attempt to nab Lecter on his own in order to collect Vergers 3 million reward. As for Lecter and Clarice they spend most of the movie apart but tracking each others moves resulting in a kind of Silence in Seattle. Moore chillier than Jodie Foster but with the same woeful delicacy of perception brings Clarice into a new even more fragile phase (the character is coming off a botched drug raid for which she was unfairly blamed) and when she and Lecter finally connect by near happenstance on a cell phone its a great fateful moment. Much has been made of the botched ending of Hannibal (the book). The truly god-awful part has been jettisoned - no more Clarice and Lecter dancing into the moonlight - but the dinner-party scene is very much intact and audiences can now leave the theater debating whether its true to the black-opera spirit of Lecter that gnashing id in civilized clothing or simply the ultimate in Grand Guignol cheek. I would just like to say this though about the very last scene The notion of Hannibal Lecter dining on leftovers - thats a truly unspeakable horror.

"Hannibal | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hannibal ) Hannibal (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its a safe bet that Ridley Scotts Hannibal is one of the most anticipated motion pictures of 2001. MGM which owns the North American distribution rights expects the film to have the biggest opening of any movie in the companys history (beating out The World Is Not Enough). It has taken ten years for the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs to reach the screen (much of the delay due to the length of time it took novelist Thomas Harris to pen the book) and sadly its not worth the wait. Hannibal isnt a terrible movie but it is a disappointment and more than a small step down from the level of its predecessor. Hannbals journey from the printed page to celluloid has been a tumultuous one. Early on Jonathan Demme (who directed Silence) bowed out. Producer Dino De Laurentiis replaced him with Ridley Scott. Soon after that celebrated playwright David Mamets script was rejected and Steven Zallian was brought in to do an overhaul (as a result of WGA rules Mamets name remains in the credits although none of the final product is his). Then publicly citing a busy schedule while privately displeased with the screenplay the original Clarice Starling Jodie Foster elected not to return. The role was re-cast with Julianne Moore winning the sweepstakes. The only constant from The Silence of the Lambs to Hannibal is Anthony Hopkins. While thats a sizeable ace in the hole the advantage doesnt turn out to be big enough. Having seen Hannibal I can understand why Jodie Foster wasnt interested. The Clarice Starling of The Silence of the Lambs was a psychologically complex individual who remained squarely at the center of the storyline. Her relationship with Hannibal Lecter was endlessly fascinating a game of mental chess between two evenly matched players who were drawn together by a perverse attraction. That Clarice is missing in action in Hannibal. The character has been emasculated and reduced to little more than a plot device. This is Lecters movie; Clarices role is secondary and theres little in the way of interesting character development. Almost nothing is done with Silences most compelling aspect the Hannibal/Clarice relationship; these two have only a handful of scenes together. Julianne Moore doing the best she can with the limited material admirably fills her predecessors shoes. Its just that Hannibal offers her a far less meaty bone to gnaw on than Silence gave to Foster. Hopkins Hannibal is as witty and urbane as ever but even he seems diminished from his Silence persona. Perhaps its that the shock value has worn off. Or perhaps its that Scott and Hopkins have made a conscious decision to tone down Hannibals creepiness factor. Theres none of the slithering/slurping tongue action that was so imitated a decade ago. The Lecter of Hannibal is more of an anti-hero than a villain. Despite some of the heinous crimes he commits we find ourselves rooting for him to get away in the end. Hannibal begins with a lengthy prologue detailing Clarices fall from grace within the FBI. Just when her career seems to be over a mysterious benefactor comes to her rescue. He is Mason Verger (an uncredited Gary Oldman) whose ""familys political contributions arent enough to buy him a senator but they are enough to rent one from time-to-time."" Verger was one of Lecters victims - he survived his encounter with the doctor but at the price of a horribly disfigured face. Now he wants Clarice back on the case because he plans to use her as bait. Meanwhile in Florence an Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) has seen through Lecters false identity and is plotting to turn him over to Verger in return for a 3 million reward. However he like so many others over the years has underestimated the cunning of his quarry. In a way it should not come as a surprise that the psychological depth of Hannibal is so far below that of The Silence of the Lambs. Scott is known for visual artistry and storytelling prowess (both of which are evident in his three best-known works Alien Blade Runner and Gladiator) but not character complexity. Consequently the individuals wandering across Scotts landscape in Hannibal function as mere pawns for the director to move around as he sees fit. Secondary characters like Verger Pazzi and racist politician Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) lack even a semblance of three-dimensionality. Actually the only reason we see Clarice as a fleshed-out person is because we got to know her so well in The Silence of the Lambs. Stylistically Hannibal is everything one would expect from a Ridley Scott film. It doesnt have the claustrophobic feel of Silence but that lack is compensated for with innovative shots and an abundance of gothic-drenched atmosphere. (My favorite moment is when Lecter turns from the camera and walks away with his cape billowing behind him. Its pure style.) One area where Scott goes over the top is in his frequent use of religious (specifically Christian) iconography including a scene in which Hannibal appears like Christ on the cross. The problem is that theres no reason for this - ultimately all of the Christian symbolism is meaningless. It doesnt contribute to the movie from a thematic or story-related perspective. Hannibal is divided into three segments. The title character is absent from the first which lasts about 30 minutes and he and Clarice dont come face-to-face until the third. The bulk of the movie is devoted to Pazzis pursuit of Hannibal - an activity that occasionally feels drawn-out and a little plodding. The ending which has been somewhat altered from what happens in the book (a change initially made in a failed attempt to lure Foster to the project) is patently absurd. In fact its so off-the-wall (not to mention gory albeit in a cartoonish way) that its almost farcical and it leaves a bad aftertaste. After waiting nearly two hours for the confrontation between Clarice and Hannibal we are treated to...this. Nothing is more disheartening than the final fifteen minutes. Fans of The Silence of the Lambs will surely flock to see Hannibal during its first weekend of release and far be it from me to dissuade them. The movie is not a hack job - it contains moments of genuine suspense always looks good and has the virtue of Anthony Hopkins returning to the greatest role of his incredibly diverse career. But theres a lot missing from the sequel and many of those absent elements are the things that differentiated Silence from so many run-of-the-mill serial killer thrillers. Whats left is at times depressingly ordinary and almost never memorable.

Now shes lost his trail. She scans the crowd her back to a whirling carousel. She doesnt notice a hand ruffling her hair--hardly more than a breeze--of someone riding the carousel. Lecter. A banquet of creepy gory or grotesque incidents is on display in Hannibal the corrosive and haunting film version of Thomas Harris sequel to The Silence of the Lambs. One man is disemboweled and hanged in public his entrails dangling like a watch fob. Another is thrown to ravenous wild boars as a Lucullan snack. A third malefactor is condemned to dine on a little brain food (his own); its Lecters idea of just desserts. But none of these atrocities is more disquieting than that moment at the carousel--the first-ever physical contact between a cannibal of genius and his righteous pursuer. For a second we fear that crime literatures favorite mad doctor will yank Clarice aboard the carousel. Perhaps scalp her. But not here not now. This is the briefest caress a boyish flirtation a threat of things to come. The film Silence of the Lambs for all its Oscars only skimmed the lower depths in which Harris novel swam with a spooky understanding of every bottom-dwelling creature. Hannibal adapted by David Mamet and Steven Zaillian fiddles more with its source and reworks--improves upon--that novels ending. Director Ridley Scott is nicely attuned to Harris depiction of evil of the strength and seduction in depravity. Each gargoyle gets his due greedy detective Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) the venal official Krendler (Ray Liotta). Even Mason Verger the pedophile with the skinless face (Gary Oldman under a layer of Toussaud wax) brings wit to his lurid vengefulness. All the actors do expert turns. And Moore makes a fine severe Clarice. As Lecter consumes his victims so Clarice assumes their pain until her face becomes a steel mask her quest a curse. Clarices empathy is that of the dead grieving for the dead. Hannibal gets deeper under Lecters skin and Hopkins feels more at ease inside it; he revels in this sociopaths freedom from scruple. Lecters deadliest weapon is not his teeth or other cutlery but his gift for the jugular--his ability to discern and exploit human weakness. Hopkins plays him suavely as the anticonscience the voice of mischief inside anyone with ambition and a grudge. The Devil works in whispers. The movie handsomely photographed by John Mathieson lives in the shadows and in subtle shades of temptation. Lecter for instance is tempted by Clarices purity; he needs to devour it if only to see if he has the will to spit it out. Caressing her hair is not enough. Can the vampire kiss the virgin? Can she resist? These not the grotty little murders are the crucial thrilling issues at Hannibals dark heart.

Although ""Hannibal"" lacks several elements that made its predecessor the Oscar-winning ""The Silence of the Lambs"" so powerful -- ""Hannibal"" still delivers most of the desired goods. Ten years and a week after Hannibal Lecter was last seen sauntering off for a meal hes back his enthusiastic eating habits quite intact. The public will likewise exhibit a ravenous appetite for the continuing saga of one of contemporary literature and cinemas most fascinating villains as played once again with exquisite taste and riveting force by Anthony Hopkins. Although ""Hannibal"" lacks several elements that made its predecessor the Oscar-winning ""The Silence of the Lambs"" so powerful -- the surprise transformation of serial killer pulp fiction into a legitimate quality film ever-escalating narrative tension and breathless encounters between the imprisoned Lecter and young FBI agent Clarice Starling then but no longer played by Jodie Foster -- ""Hannibal"" still delivers most of the desired goods. Opening will be huge and biz should sustain for some weeks given the absence of any other high profile releases until March. Domestic distrib MGMs long dry spell looks to end and results internationally where Universal is handling distribution should be even bigger. ""Hannibal"" is not as good as ""Lambs""; as with Thomas Harris initially mesmerizing 1999 bestseller the film reaches its peak in the Italian-set second act becoming more routine in plotting and execution after that. Furthermore Ridley Scotts opulent impressionistic direction while striking on its own terms doesnt lend itself to the sort of sustained creepiness and complex character interplay delivered by Jonathan Demmes carefully tooled craftsmanship. Ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor ""Hannibal"" is nevertheless tantalizing engrossing and occasionally startling. Contrary to expectations given the possibilities offered by the book the film is not terribly bloody and is gruesome only where it means to be. Just as Scott refrained from graphic displays of spurting blood and severed limbs in ""Gladiator"" so here does he exhibit discretion by downplaying the overt gore even if its always clear whats going on. As penned by David Mamet then by Steven Zaillian script is for better or worse quite faithful to the Harris blueprint; fans of the tome may regret the perhaps necessary excision of some characters most notably that of Mason Vergers muscle-bound macho sister Margot as well as of the considerable fascinating academic detail but will basically feel the book has been respected (yes even the climactic dinner party is served up intact with the only surprise twists saved for its wake). A decade into her career Clarice Starling this time portrayed by Julianne Moore achieves a dubious distinction becoming the female FBI agent with the most recorded kills In the cop show-like opening set-piece a major Washington D.C. drug bust gets the wrong kind of publicity when Starling in self-defense shoots and kills a dealer whose baby is strategically strapped to her body. Having made the bureau look bad shes suddenly put under suspicion and on the sidelines by her superiors notably Justice Dept. hotshot Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) who harbors a long-standing grudge against the attractive agent who became famous for the spectacular success she scored on her first case. Though the man has not been heard from in years the specter of Hannibal Lecter has never vanished least of all for one Mason Verger an endlessly wealthy wastrel whose arguable misfortune it is to be the lone survivor of a Lecter attack; confined to a wheelchair on his vast estate his face has the consistency and attractiveness of steak tartare and his prime interest in life is to kidnap Hannibal Lecter and subject him to the most hideous torture his vengeful mind can conjure. His plan To unleash starving giant pigs on his tormentor and keep him alive while the beasts devour his feet and eventually the rest of him. To this end Verger interviews hospital orderly Barney (Frankie R. Faison along with Hopkins the only ""Lambs"" actor to return here) and Starling the lone individuals to have survived sustained exposure to Lecter years back. He also posts a 3 million reward which attracts the attention in Florence Italy of Detective Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) who rightly suspects that a local newcomer Dr. Fell who is poised to take over a distinguished scholarly position after the mysterious disappearance of the previous office holder is in fact Hannibal Lecter. Faced with the ethical choice of pursuing Lecter officially as a cop or illicitly as a bounty hunter Pazzi chooses the latter course. The detective plays a quiet game of cat-and-mouse with Lecter observing him on his rounds of the exquisite Renaissance city and figuring out a devious if tragic way to obtain the suspects fingerprints for verification. Of course Lecter is never one to play the mouse. Making his grand entrance a half-hour into the film Hopkins Lecter is seen living grandly in the 15th century splendor of the Palazzo Capponi enjoying the finest things in life after his eight-year incarceration lecturing brilliantly to local academics -- and newly energized with his discovery of Starlings disgrace and the thought that he may now be back on law enforcements radar. With the aide of some professional thugs Pazzi plots to spring a trap on Lecter. But the master criminal brilliantly turns the tables on his pursuer in a way that literally shows the touch of an artist as Pazzi joins some of his infamous ancestors in the grotesquely public and immortalized manner of his demise. At this point it is clear that Hannibal Lecter hasnt lost a step and neither has Hopkins in continuing the seductively diabolical portrayal that won him an Oscar 10 years ago. Mastering and savoring everything in his universe Lecter impresses and terrifies by virtue of his staggering intelligence and complete command of every situation; even when Lecter is physically constrained one still cannot get the better of him. While ""Lambs"" soared partly because of the pent-up power of the monster in a cage ""Hannibal"" imparts its own pleasures by painting a portrait of a man of ultimate civilized refinements whose dark side always threatens to lurch violently out. When Lecter and the action return irrevocably Stateside 80 minutes in the plotting takes on a more mechanical feel just as the visuals so lavishly appointed in Florence become more mundane. Never having forgotten Clarice Starling Lecter circles her talking and writing to her just as she is unjustly accused of warning the cannibal of impending police action against him. But suddenly Vergers goons succeed in snaring Lecter and are preparing to give him a taste of his own medicine when Starling must make her own moral and ethical choices about intervening in the fate of the demon who has understood her better than any other man. The infamous dinner scene which ironically recalls the feast Hopkins recently cooked up in ""Titus"" and involves Lecter serving an unsuspecting victim morsels from his own body was weird enough in the book and is even weirder to witness played out onscreen. Some will cringe and not be able to look others will find it ludicrous while others still -- many teenage boys no doubt -- will consider it very cool and the main reason to see the movie. Scotts sense of moderation abandons him here with a result thats rather over the top and perversely humiliating to the actor involved. The writers have come up with a capper that feels more appropriate than the books coda probably would have been onscreen. As Starling Moore acquits herself solidly in circumstances that dont allow the sort of psychological revelations and heavy confrontations that Foster made the most of in ""Lambs."" Although she gets considerable screen time Starling is not quite as central here as she was in the previous picture and the character spends a good deal of time being reprimanded and frustrated by her superiors. All the same it would seem that Foster made a big mistake in turning down the reprise as she could certainly now use the sort of hit ""Hannibal"" promises to be. Supporting perfs are what they need to be if one-dimensional. Big ""secret"" given that his name appears nowhere in the front credits or in the final cast list is that the faceless Mason Verger is played by Gary Oldman. Thesps involvement is only suggested by a mysterious ""assistant to Gary Oldman"" credit deep in the end crawl and performance is one of those odd stunts that comes off; the character is so strangely deranged that to root for him against Lecter no matter how heinous the latter may be is utterly impossible. Visually Ridley Scott is clearly now in his Blue Period as he and ""Gladiator"" lenser John Mathieson bathe the action in seas of blue light whenever possible. Spectacular locations not only in Florence but at the ornate Biltmore Estate in North Carolina (as Vergers palatial domicile) and James Madisons former estate in Montpelier Va. are abetted by Norris Spencers high-end production design and Janty Yates apt costumes. Pietro Scalias editing is expert while Hans Zimmers effective score is dominated in the end by an original opera duet written by Patrick Cassidy.
