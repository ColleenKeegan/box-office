If your receptionist is a borderline-offensive gay stereotype he will gab away important expositional information. Unless you are impervious to falling chandeliers dont piss off Beyonce Knowles--ever. Finally dont think that exploiting female paranoia and the promise of Knowles throwing punches is enough to make up for your unabashed B-movie hitting the skids at the halfway point.

Dont expect a pot full of boiling bunnies because nothing so creatively crazy ever happens in ""Obsessed"" a ""Fatal Attraction""-inspired predatory-female domestic thriller that spends much time spinning its wheels and making auds practically beg for an explanation to all the madness and obsession. Beyonce Knowles may be the big B.O. draw in this Stephen Shill-helmed psychodrama which topped the weekend B.O. with a surprising 28.5 million opening but shes barely a supporting player The movie belongs to Ali Larter whos long overdue for some kind of bigscreen breakout. Sultry blonde Larter (""Heroes"") plays office temp/temptress Lisa Sheridan who isnt even off the elevator at her latest job before shes set her psychotic sights on Derek (Idris Elba) a good-looking happily married up-and-coming investment broker at a flourishing downtown Los Angeles firm. Derek and wife Sharon (Knowles) who have a kid have just moved into a cavernous old house with a wobbly attic floor and a glass-top table directly underneath it downstairs (remember this later). They seem the picture of contentment save for Sharons obvious unhappiness with the fact that Derek has a new female assistant. ""I want her fired immediately"" Sharon says (so much for sisterhood) and no one seems to think this marks any instability in what is soon to be one plutonium-enriched domestic partnership. But Derek it seems met Sharon at work too (cue the organist). Sharon doesnt leave a good impression but Derek is the picture of marital fidelity No matter how slinkily Lisa comports herself Derek says no thanks. Derek is believable enough; not so Lisa whose inappropriate antics wouldnt be tolerated for five minutes in todays sexual harassment-conscious corporate atmosphere. David Lougherys screenplay never provides any explanation for why she is who she is She has no motives other than mad obsession (which isnt that interesting really; even the Wicked Witch of the West had reasons) and she has no backstory Unless her temp agency recruits its workers outside Home Depot Lisa would have to have references and she would have to have acquired them from somewhere outside the mental-health community. If Derek had actually slept with Lisa a la Michael Douglas in ""Fatal Attraction"" ""Obsessed"" would at least have had the spurned-woman gambit to play however hoary. But Shill and Loughery arent overly concerned with plausibility There isnt one woman in a position higher than secretary at Dereks firm and this alone makes the pic as shaky as Dereks attic floor. The seldom-seen Christine Lahti does play the requisite detective albeit one who has a tendency to show up just as the action has come to an end. Bruce McGill is his usual sturdy self as Dereks boss but Jerry OConnell gives one weird performance as his office pal Ben. Ben may be in love with Derek. It seems to be an unhealthy trend. Production values are good notably the editing by veteran Paul Seydor. ObsessedProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Screen Gems presentation of a Rainforest production.

"Obsessed Innocence fatal to action | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesObsessed Innocence fatal to actionIf the producers had done their work properly on Obsessed I would not now be wishing I could reclaim the two hours I wasted on this tepid sexless thrill-free melodrama.Ali Larter is the office temp after the husband of Beyonce Knowles above in ""Obsessed"" the curiously sexless update on ""Fatal Attraction"".  (SUZANNE TENNER)  By Greg QuillBooks ColumnistSun. April 26 2009Obsessed (out of 4)Its pitiful I know to complain about a job that entails sitting in a comfortable theatre for a couple of hours assessing a movies artistic and/or entertainment value while workers in the real world are dealing with all kinds of hardship stress and crises on the first truly beautiful afternoon of the years promising summer.And if the producers had done their work properly on Obsessed - the much-advertised Beyonce Knowles star vehicle about a happily married young mother whose upscale life is fractured by a demented blond office temp with designs on her straight-arrow husband which represents itself as a racially spiked take on Fatal Attraction - I would not now be wishing I could reclaim the two hours I wasted on this tepid sexless thrill-free melodrama.Article Continued BelowAccept my complaint as an attempt to save discerning movie audiences from similar ennui.For those whove never seen Fatal Attraction the plot points in Obsessed are flashed so far in advance that comparisons are unnecessary. For those who admire Adrian Lynes 1987 gripper its essentially the same story (without the boiled bunny) but with a climactic cat-fight thats not nearly so cathartic.The greatest of several astounding flaws in the design of the update however is that British director Steve Shill - best known for his work on TVs sexed-up The Tudors - and writer David Loughrey (Lakeview Terrace) have removed all traces of moral ambiguity in their leading man the tormented and transparently innocent husband Derek (Idris Elba who did such great work as a gangster with mainstream corporate ambitions in TVs The Wire). They also stripped the drama of its potentially gripping - and obvious - racial overtones.Aside from his past record as a seducer of vulnerable female work colleagues and an apparent acceptance of macho sexism among his male peers Dereks worst offence is not fessing up to them or to his wife Sharon (Knowles) when the new temp at his Los Angeles office Lisa (Ali Larter from the TV series Heroes) hits on him at the office Christmas party and in the parking lot a few days later. That oversight only encourages Lisa who begins an aggressive stalking strategy that gets only more rejection and sets up the inevitable violent conclusion but not before a laughably impressionable detective played by a very confused Christine Lahti gets into the mix and implies - because the plot needs some kind of jolt any jolt - that Derek may not be as innocent as he appears to be.Also missing from Obsessed are efforts to create any sexual heat between Derek and Lisa even between Derek and Sharon or visceral terror. This donkey plods along as if motivated by a stick across the rump not by passion or logic.Obsessed offers its stars few opportunities other than to mouth lines that often sound absurd and little scope to display their chops. Elba even with the lions share of screen time is reduced to a cipher. Larter as the delusional seductress gets no back-story to work with and nothing in the script that justifies her psychopathic behaviour.Knowles one of the producers may have been hoping for a part with some grit and emotional power but she gets very little to do till she starts whacking on the bad lady.And when that happens the relief is overwhelming. The end we suspect is nigh.

"Thriller fans wont be Obsessed with stale stalker tale - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Thriller fans wont be Obsessed with stale stalker tale Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | ABOUT THE MOVIE Obsessed Stars Idris Elba Beyonce Knowles Ali Larter Jerry OConnellDirector Steve ShillDistributor Sony PicturesRating PG-13 for sexual material including some suggestive dialogue some violence and thematic content Running time 1 hour 45 minutesIn theaters nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Great-looking actors glossy locations and a knock-down drag-out girlfight still dont make Obsessed anything more than a predictable and tawdry Fatal Attraction-style guilty pleasure. Pretty quickly into this overheated stalker thriller we are dead sure of a few things Beyonce Knowles is one fierce mama lion and Ali Larters crazy seductress doesnt stand a chance. Idris Elba as the ideal husband/executive/father is shockingly dim when it comes to the neon-obvious motives of the psychotic temp at his office. Unlike Michael Douglas morally ambiguous character in 1987s classic scorned woman thriller Elba plays an unequivocally good man. No shades of gray are allowed in this by-the-numbers drama. And no sense of timeliness or realism either. Besides being a faithful dreamboat Elbas career is on a dramatic rise even though hes an investment banker. Did we mention this is a cautionary fairy tale? Knowles is Sharon a young mother happily married to the hunky and devoted Derek (Elba). Derek has it all a beautiful loving wife an adorable baby son a stately new home and a sporty Benz. He seems carefully constructed as every womans dream guy each glorious characteristic ladled on thick. So its no surprise when he also becomes the fever dream of Lisa (Larter) an unhinged blond temp. Lisas seductive pipe dream quickly devolves into Derek and Sharons worst nightmare. The temp/temptress will stop at nothing to win her fantasy man. When its clear hes not interested she fluctuates between wide-eyed delusions clever manipulations that make him appear like the predator or full-on psycho revenge. Lisa is so maniacal she even pops a roofie in Dereks dirty martini. She may be the first on-screen female date rapist. If youre looking for well-written dialogue delivered with conviction dont look here. Dereks leering best friend (Jerry OConnell) warns him ""A lot of these single gals see the workplace as their hunting ground and I think this one has you in her crosshairs."" Does anyone actually talk like that? And then there are the lines that have wannabe catchphrase written all over them ""Im not your typical temp"" purrs Lisa early on. Later Sharon growls ""Didnt I tell you not to come to my house?"" Head-butts ensue. Elbas performance is better than either Knowles or Larter but nearly everyone in the supporting cast is reducible to a caricature from Dereks boozy boss (Bruce McGill) to his gossipy gay assistant (Matthew Humphreys). Christine Lahti has a small part as a poker-faced police detective. Why would she take such a thankless part or perhaps more importantly why does Hollywood confine smart and talented actresses of a certain age to such throwaway roles? That such thoughts come to mind while watching shows that Obsessed is a pretty listless thriller. Its a stale and familiar concept but it does offer a jolt or two and a few laughs. And how fresh does a guilty pleasure really need to be? Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

""Temp or temptress?"" asks one of the associates admiring the shapely legs on the pouty blonde.Derek (Idris Elba of The Wire) one of the firms rainmakers is less attracted to than flustered by the femme fatale who stalks him in the parking garage and the mens room. Hes happily married to Sharon (BeyoncA(c) Knowles) - formerly his assistant. They have a new son and a new house with an unfinished attic that you just know will play a dramatic role in the finale.Obsessed a schlockily entertaining film that would make any daytime soap look subtle is a ""wreck the homewrecker"" movie.That is its two acts of intrigue building to a third-act catfight between two extremely attractive women. In this case one woman is black and the other white which creates racial tension. Know that Obsessed screenwriter David Loughery wrote the racially charged Lakeview Terrace. Also know that Obsessed is about the sanctity of marriage rather than the shame of adultery.While the three leads are easy on the eyes their dialogue is pretty harsh on the ears. One doesnt expect a movie of this type to be plausible but this one stretches the plausibility factor past the snapping point to the unintentional-laughter point.As an audience-participation flick Obsessed successfully pushes the emotional button marked ""Not With My Husband You Dont."" As melodrama though it lacks the heat and guilt-soaked sheets that made Fatal Attraction such a potent cocktail.In Obsessed the hot-button issue isnt adultery. It is Girlfriend are you going to let that bony-butt blonde take your man?Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Been there done that (better). From left Idris Elba Ali Larter and Beyonce Knowles in Obsessed. (Suzanne Tenner) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / April 25 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Ladies I think weve all been here. Some woman at your mans work thinks he belongs to her. She hatches a deranged plot to break you up so she can (legally) have him. He tells you nothing happened. You throw him out. ""And where should I go?"" he asks. ""To hell"" you say. He woos you back but shes still in the picture - OK shes in your house. And now you have to hurt her.""Obsessed"" which opened yesterday but was kept from critics dutifully revises the ""blank from hell"" genre which gave the world ridiculous misogynist thrillers in the mid-1980s and early 1990s. In ""Obsessed"" the ""blank"" is a temp - not to be confused with the temp-from-hell Lara Flynn Boyle had a good time playing in 1993s ""The Temp."" This time its Ali Larter a generically pretty blonde in a role that exists only to make some audiences talk back to the screen. And talk they will. After all Beyonce Knowles plays the wronged wife.Her name is Sharon and shes married a scrumptious-looking finance executive named Derek (Idris Elba). As Lisa his assistant Larter goes from flirtatious to actionable in about five seconds She positions herself under the mistletoe at the office holiday party listens in on his phone calls and rubs all over him in a mens room stall. After hopping into his Mercedes she rips open a rain jacket that reveals tuxedo-print skivvies. (Ladies Im afraid Ive been there before too.)All this precedes Lisas suicide and baby-napping attempts. Through it all Larter licks her lips flings her hair and smiles with devilish abandon. The temp-from-hell maybe. Attack of the killer Lakers Girl for sure.Despite its provocative potential ""Obsessed"" basically plays it safe. The obvious racial buttons are never pushed - Derek is black Lisa white and Beyonce Beyonce. And Derek never comes close to being um tempted. We know hes a saint even if his saintliness is understandable. As Jill Scott once sang Hes got something better at home.As that something better Beyonce wears what looks like one of Janet Jacksons old weaves and waits for the big confrontation which is a showcase more for her physical fitness than anything else.""Obsessed"" happily toes the genres sexist line. Womans only career is man - getting him keeping him slipping him a roofie. Dodging weaponized floor lamps and planks of wood Beyonce is ferocious all the same. But watching this movie is like sitting through an eternal rehash of the vengeful feelings shes already covered so vividly in song. Take 2006s ""Ring the Alarm"" in which Beyonce more or less tells a man shed sooner go to jail than see him with someone else. ""I done put in a call/ Time to ring the alarm/ Cause you aint never seen a fire like the one Im gone cause.""That folks is obsessed.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Comments (2) Obsessed This biracial entry in the psycho-bitch stalker sweepstakes is inept and stupid but not without its base pleasures. Idris Elba (The Wire) is a financier whose failure to set boundaries with a psychotic blond temp (Ali Larter) threatens his career and ""perfect marriage"" to Beyonce Knowles. While scenes between Elba and Larter have a certain crass crackle he and Knowles share all the chemistry of frozen fish sticks. The dreadful script delivers unintentional laughs while gutlessly dodging the race angle and the odious minor characters--Elbas horndog coworker (Jerry OConnell) and treacherous gay secretary (Matthew Humphreys)--do more to lower the tone than the ballyhooed cat-fight climax. Director Steve Shill is a TV journeyman and works to rule. 105 min.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Back in 1994 as part of his ongoing series of reactionary thrillers about dangers that would never pan out in real life (see also the Japanese economic takeover in Rising Sun) Michael Crichton released Disclosure which tapped into the fear that career women would use sexual-harassment codes to gain leverage over men. By the time the movie adaptation came out the same year the idea already seemed as dated as the films cheesy virtual-reality sequences. At its core the whole risible enterprise was just a cover for men who felt threatened by women in the workplace and the sexual-harassment issue was only a symptom of a more wide-ranging paranoia. Obsessed is like 1994 all over again except with an added layer of contemptible racial politics thrown into the mix. Its still about the horrors of a woman infringing upon the boys club of corporate culture but its also a revenge fantasy about interracial relationships exploiting the regressive stereotype of white Jezebels peeling African-American men away from their wives and families. Doing his best to class up the joint The Wires Idris Elba stars as the perfect man--wildly successful executive at a financial firm faithful husband and loving father and seemingly chiseled from a slab of the finest Italian marble. Putting the temp in temptress Ali Larter subs as Elbas administrative assistant and immediately works to seduce him; when he resists her subtle advances she quickly shifts into full-on crazy rabbit-boiling bitch mode. The action is rigged to set up a showdown between Larter and Elbas wife played by a leaden Beyonce Knowles but rooting interests between those two are harder to establish than the filmmakers must have intended. Larter is a purely diabolical creature motivated entirely by the homicidal slut within but Elbas castrating wife isnt much of a prize either; she professes her trust for him only to forbid him explicitly from working closely with women of any kind. These titans come together for a suitably overheated finale and Obsessed makes an inadvertent argument for the monastery.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Memo to Beyonce Knowles You were so good as Etta James in Cadillac Records so whyd you go spoil everything with a rank cheeseball thriller that buries you in cliches and wont even help you dig yourself out? Id call this stenchcloud ""Fatal Attraction meets The Temp"" but that would insult those movies. Movie? Obsessed doesnt move at all. It lays there like undigested latkes. Beyonce Knowles (she uses two names for movies) plays Sharon. Shes happily married to asset manager Derek (Idris Elba) once on fire with The Wire and now reduced to a situation dire. OK Ill stop. But the movie doesnt. Everything you need to know is in the trailer. Derek gets hit on by Lisa (Ali Larter) a temp from central slut casting. He resists her jiggly butt and pert breasts. This is the kind of no-balls movie where the guy is a saint even before the temp turns psycho stalker. So wheres the conflict? Nowhere. Screenwriter David Loughery and director Steve Shill a TV hack (whod have guessed?) have built something silly and shockingly unsexy (a wimpy PG-13 rating for this kind of trash -- whaat?) all in the name of big climactic catfight that should been camp fun but is no fun at all. Beyonce does go medieval on what she calls Larters ""skinny white ass."" She also calls her ""crazy ass bitch."" Obsessed is crazy-ass also. Crazy-ass awful.

Joe Neumaier Friday April 24 2009 1039 PM Title Obsessed A womans family and home are threatened when a stalker targets her husband. With Beyonce Knowles Idris Elba Ali Larter. (145) PG13 Violence sexuality language. At area theaters. The one star ""Obsessed"" gets matches the one reason anyone would see it Beyonce whose only scene of any substance - scolding her husband in a kitchen confrontation - comes halfway into the movie.Unfortunately the movie seems constructed just to get the singer/actress into a knockdown catfight shoehorning one of show business sexiest entertainers into a scorned-woman role. Even then the payoff feels cheap. The result is more like ""Delayed Frustration"" than ""Fatal Attraction.""Beyonce gets second billing after Idris Elba as Derek a driven husband father and VP of a Los Angeles financial firm. The offices resident alpha male he attracts the attention of the slinky new temp Lisa (Ali Larter) from the moment the two share an elevator.Setting her sights on Derek Lisa wrangles to be his assistant wiggles around him at a Christmas party and gets him into various compromising positions - in a bathroom in a parking garage at a work retreat.Derek resists each time but delusional Lisa has fabricated a passionate affair in her mind.Derek doesnt tell any of this to his gorgeous wife Sharon (Beyonce) until after Lisas melodramatic suicide attempt. By then though the trust is broken and he has to earn his way back into their new mansion. But where Derek goes Lisa and her craziness lurk - including into his house and near his child in the movies creepiest scene.Elba best known from HBOs ""The Wire"" is a sturdy lead capable of making Dereks confident friendliness seem like flirtation and vice versa. He also has a dont-mess-with-me attitude that should give a stalker second thoughts but Larter (""Heroes"") doesnt have anything going on behind her eyes so her obsession seems like merely a screenwriting necessity.When she finally faces off with Sharon the mother studying for college ought to easily outsmart the crazy temp from hell.But director Steve Shill lets it boil down to a claws-out brawl which does Beyonce no favors; hunched over with fists up the elegance she showed in ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Cadillac Records"" is gone. The lady can be fierce but she deserves better. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie review Obsessed -- 1 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Obsessed -- 1 out of 5 stars Ali Larter and Idris Elba Sony Sony Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Obsessed is a thriller built around the married womans worst fear -- the office blond after her husband. Make the married woman black and you take that to another level -- the black womans fear of that skinny white blond chasing her man.But whoever thought remaking Fatal Attraction as a PG-13 thriller was a good idea earns much of the blame for this laughably arch dud. As they stumble through the minefield of racial-sexual politics the filmmakers strip the heat and most of the guilt away from a story that was salable in seven short words -- ""Beyonce and Ali third-act cat fight."" Idris Elba is Derek the boss of a financial planning firm with a new temp.""I think youll find Im not your typical temp"" Lisa (Ali Larter) purrs as she shows a little leg and Derek notices. He may be a Boy Scout and devout husband (and new father) now but time was when Derek was the office hound. He spends the entire movie avoiding Lisas increasingly aggressive advances. ""Temp? Temptress"" a politically incorrect colleague (Jerry OConnell) growls.But Derek has the stunning Sharon (Beyonce) at home. Hes paranoid because he knows his old reputation. And shes paranoid because she got her man the same way she sees Lisa trying to get her man -- scheming batting her eyes. Things escalate -- instant message flirting drinks at the office Christmas party. Its all big strong Derek can do to fend off this cat-eyed wisp of a temp.The Brit director of this Steve Shill directed lots of episodes of Showtimes sexed-up The Tudors. But he is at a loss at how to create heat between Larter and Elba. The actor seems uncomfortable with the whole idea and the actress struggles to keep a straight face as she hurls herself at him -- in comically unsexy underwear or in the mens room at their office.Knowles gives a performance of big hair big heels and big eyes until things turn all Glenn Close in the third act. Ive liked every one of these performers in other films but this reduces them to broad gestures eye-rolling one-liners and ridiculously stiff and over-the-top good husband vs. evil vamp situations.Even the office environment seems tone deaf and out of date from Dereks confidence in ""hedge funds"" to the Christmas party and sexist banter among men (Bruce McGill is the big boss) that companies now avoid in order to dodge harassment lawsuits. The whole movie feels like something from about 1984.It may turn out to be a crowd pleaser (if unintentional laughs count). It could have been more. Obsessed has cant-miss hot-buttons built into it. But cast and crew keep fumbling around and hitting ""pause"" instead.

Hes the executive vice president of a Los Angeles asset-management firm thats thriving exactly as it would in a movie conceived before the economic crisis. Hes moving his family into an impossibly spacious polished-oakwood-floor dream house. And hes married to a woman so radiant and gorgeous and soulful that shes played by Beyonce Knowles. What could spin things wrong? Try the arrival in Dereks office of a new temp assistant (Ali Larter) whos a vicious erotic predator with perfectly tapered flaring nostrils. Obsessed is an obvious gloss on Fatal Attraction a movie that has lived in the popular imagination for more than two decades because of how splendidly it squeezed Hitchcockian thrills out of an addled sexually complicated real-life messiness. Glenn Close as the other woman scorned may have been playing a feminist Medusa but her rage at being tossed away after an affair spoke to a new world in which women leveraging their power had rewritten the rules of attraction. Its doubtful that Obsessed will stick in the popular imagination for more than two weeks because the movie is borderline ludicrous and it jams its characters into rigid slots. Larter as the office temptress who just about sexually assaults our hero is a total psycho obsessed -- and unhinged -- from the get-go and Knowles Sharon (who met her husband when she was his assistant) is jealous before shes even laid eyes on her rival. As for Derek he has none of the fascinating culpability of Michael Douglas in the earlier film. Hes guilty of nothing more than fatal flirtation. Its hard to shake the feeling that Obsessed regurgitates Fatal Attractions adultery plot minus any actual adultery because the director TV veteran Steve Shill and the screenwriter David Loughery are copping out. The movie wants to tease us with intimations of a steamy biracial liaison; it just doesnt want to actually go there. If Derek is innocent then once Larters vamp starts to invade his private space and pretend that theyve had a mad affair why doesnt he just clear things up by you know talking to his wife? The bizarre paranoid premise of Obsessed is that Knowles -- and by extension any good stand-by-your-man wife these days -- is more than just loyal; shes a high-maintenance Force To Be Reckoned With. And so even though Derek is innocent she views him as guilty. This puts the wife and the un-mistress in the odd position of acting like secret sisters locked in collusion over their destruction of a mans integrity. And when Christine Lahti shows up as the worlds most gullible police investigator (naturally she believes the stalker) her myopia just makes her the third leg of the sisterhood. Obsessed has little plausibility but at moments its an entertaining bad movie and the performers are vivid. Elba the gifted British actor best known as a regular on The Office gives Derek a moneyed middle-class solidity without ever suggesting that its dulled his senses. Larter is so sorority-bitch insincere she makes you hate her on sight. And Knowles takes the ridiculous role of a diva-housewife and makes it play...without rendering it any less ridiculous. The climactic catfight is so over-the-top that about all its missing is Tyler Perrys Madea popping out of the woodwork to wave her tiny gun at the blonde home-wrecker.
