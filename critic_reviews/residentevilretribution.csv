Updated September 17 2012 107 PM By RAFER GUZMAN rafer.guzmannewsday.com + - Milla Jovovich in ""Resident Evil Retribution."" Photo Credit Handout advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Plot Apocalypse survivor and zombie killer Alice is back -- and she has a daughter. R rating for extreme violence and gore. BOTTOM LINE Bloody action bloodless acting no plot -- kind of like a video game except you cant turn it off. CAST Milla Jovovich Michelle Rodriguez Aryana Engineer Johann Urb LENGTH 135 If youre a newcomer to the ""Resident Evil"" franchise you may have concerns about walking in cold to movie No. 5. After all what do you know about T-Viruses and zombie storm troopers? Fortunately writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson begins with some lengthy exposition about the shadowy Umbrella Corporation and its profit-generating pandemics. Once youre all caught up let the stabbing shooting and slow-motion martial-arts sequences begin. Thats about all ""Resident Evil Retribution"" has to offer and theres no use complaining that it feels like a video game since its based on one (launched by Capcom in 1996). Moving from scenario to scenario with different backgrounds and levels of difficulty ""Retribution"" is essentially a video game you dont even have to play.

Its also tacit acknowledgment that those curvaceous but dead-eyed avatars on your PlayStation arent as sexy as living bodies. The women here are living fetish objects distinguished mostly by their outfits Alice (Milla Jovovich) our zombie-battling heroine wears special-ops Samp;M gear; Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) dresses like an evil debutante; Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez not seen since the original film) favors butchy tank-tops. Ada Wong (Li Bingbing) serves as the Asian doll in a side-slit red dress. The men are mostly interchangeable soldier-types who say things like ""Synchronize your watches"" There are some nifty visuals (a bloody beat-down in a glowing white hallway) but the script is incoherent and the acting is terrible -- avatars would have been an improvement. (Rodriguez an underappreciated action star is an exception; so is Aryana Engineer as Becky a new daughter figure to Alice.) Its hard to care whether these characters survive all the randomly generated monsters but ""Retribution"" has introduced the idea of clones so that characters can be killed and brought back to life.

(Rafy) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday September 14 2012 603 PM Title Resident Evil Retribution Film Info With Milla Jovovich. A woman returns to fight zombies in defense of the human race. Director Paul W.S. Anderson. (141) R Violence. Area theaters. In 3D where available. Magic moment A giant beast with an exposed brain attacks. This week theres a new film from Paul Thomas Anderson (""The Master"") as well as Paul W.S. Anderson. Get your Andersons right because the former is the one whose work is a stately superb contemplative drama about the nature and limits of belief and the second is about zombies. There is certainly a place for zombies in pop culture -- their place in fact is pretty much anywhere vampires arent. But even so ""Resident Evil Retribution"" Paul W.S. Andersons fifth film in the undead-action franchise spawned by a Capcom video game is thuddingly awful. Though this series has had its highlights (the 2002 original and the previous entry 2010s ""Resident Evil Afterlife"" hold up the best) this new one is not one of them. And layered with muddy-looking unnecessary and cash-grabbing 3-D it gives even more of a headache than it had to. ""Retribution"" actually seems even more of a video game than the first film a decade ago. Perhaps thats because Alice (series linchpin Milla Jovovich also Mrs. W.S. Anderson FYI) spends the first 10 minutes after a strange backward-unspooling recap of the previous films finale jabbering at the audience from inside a video screen as scenes from the earlier movies float around her. Obviously a recap of how Alice became the sworn enemy and ultimate threat to the Umbrella corporation is needed but this seems lazy. As does most of the dialogue; lazy and hyperbolic. Things dont just spread they ""spread like wildfire."" People dont just dont know things -- they say ""Your guess is as good as mine."" And as Alice awakens to find herself in a sort of training facility for the Umbrella corporation she has to shoot zombies and find friends alive in one of several simulated settings Tokyo Moscow Berlin (where World War II outfits are still in fashion) and of course Suburbia where in her simulated home outside Raccoon City (that is still a great name) a clone Alice in a blond wig takes care of a clone daughter. Lines like ""Ready to face Umbrella"" bring to mind other more fun variations that Anderson the screenwriter as well as director could have used. ""Can you close Umbrella?"" ""Can you break Umbrella?"" and ""Can you use Umbrella as a weapon?"" are only three missed possibilities. Once Alice defeats the Umbrella Corporations artificial intelligence unit the Red Queen -- ah that old Lewis Carroll influence again -- she reunites with Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) for what becomes basically a parade of zombie shootings group infighting and slow-motion kicks. There is a giant monster with an exposed brain who shows up but likely realizing his brain wasnt wanted soon disappears. The still-lovely Jovovich appears more than ever to know like her counterpart Kate Beckinsale in the ""Underworld"" movies that these movies are pulp comic gunk but thats no excuse for the low level of effort she puts into it. To be fair Anderson has constructed an unexciting confusing ""Tron""-y world for Alice and company this time around so theres not much to do except shoot whatever moves and wait for reloads and more zombies with octopus mouths. In the next movie -- yes another sequel is set up at the end of this one ""the beginning of the end"" were promised -- Jovovich ought to fight for a bit more coherence. Unless the title is already set as ""Resident Evil Utter Confusion.""

Some sequels suggest that no one involved with a franchise really cares anymore. Witness ""Resident Evil Retribution"" the latest and arguably least coherent entry in the long-running series starring Milla Jovovich as a straight-shooting ass-kicking heroine who battles zombies inadvertently spawned by a multinational corporation whose overlords truth to tell dont appear terribly sorry about their spectacularly destructive screw-up. Even devoted fans may wonder whether this installment is actually a haphazard patchwork of outtakes from previous ""Resident Evil"" pics. Still international B.O. and vid sales probably will encourage the follow-up threatened at the end of this episode. Sony release had grossed a solid 8.4 million as of Friday. Writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson husband of the franchises formidably resilient leading lady has concocted a plot that has something to do with a commando mission to rescue Alice (Jovovich) from the clutches of the nefarious Umbrella Corp. and something else to do with an extended chase through a massive underground complex of interconnected areas designed as humongous simulacrums of assorted suburbs and world capitals. But its all too easy to believe that Anderson tossed his own script early on and simply showed up on the set every morning downed two or three energy drinks and then asked his cast and crew ""OK what do we shoot up or blow up today?"" Bombs explode vehicles collide glass is shattered automatic weapons are fired and bit players -- cast as either flesh-eating zombies Umbrella Corp. security personnel or both -- are sliced diced shattered and otherwise slaughtered with the sort relentless repetitiveness one normally associates with the music of Philip Glass. If so much of this death and destruction werent presented in slo-mo the pic might be a good deal shorter than it is. Here and there Jovovich shows her maternal side when Alice bonds with a deaf little girl (Aryana Engineer) who may or may not be the heroines daughter. More often however its pretty much same-old same-old for Jovovich who relies even more than usual on her purposeful stride graceful physicality and fiercely determined grimaces. Several other alumni from earlier ""Resident Evil"" pics are on hand for this sequel which unfortunately only serves to reinforce the overall enervating sense of deja vu. On the other hand its undeniably amusing when the bodaciously badass Michelle Rodriguez (who seems to die even more often in this franchise than she does in the ""Fast and the Furious"" series) is handed a weapon but hesitates to fire it. As she sweetly explains ""I campaigned for gun control."" Production values indicate the producers spent a bit more money on this installment. Yet several shots obviously intended to dazzle look like images from ironically a second-rate vidgame and the 3D effects arent anything to write home about either.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr RESIDENT EVIL RETRIBUTION Milla Jovovich (Rafy) B- Resident Evil Retribution Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Sienna Guillory Milla Jovovich Michelle Rodriguez; Director Paul Anderson (Director); Release Date Wide 09/14/2012; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Posted September 15 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT Writer-director W.S. Andersons overseeing of the Resident Evil zombie franchise has proven to be both lunatically haphazard and dementedly enthusiastic. Does the Brit auteur lie awake at night plotting out a Christopher Nolan-esque multi-film character arc for Milla Jovovichs undead-battling heroine Alice? Hey maybe he does and maybe doesnt. But he definitely spent time working out a reason why Jovovich -- Andersons real-life wife -- should spend the majority of this fifth film in the series kicking zombie butt while sporting an Samp;M-styled catsuit which makes the most of the actress derriere. Truth be told Jovovichs outfit is one of the less ridiculous facets of the berserk intermittently entertaining Resident Evil Retribution. This time around we track Alice as she seeks to escape a vast subterranean Umbrella Corporation testing facility in Kamchatka that features monsters aplenty recreations of assorted capital cities and clones of characters from the first movie (a plot point which conveniently allows the return of various actors from that film including a double duty-doing Michelle Rodriguez). Why did Umbrella capture Alice in the first place? Why is former Umbrella chief Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) so desperate to remove her from the corporations clutches that he sends a band of commando-types half way around the world to rescue her? Indeed given the planet has been overrun by hungry tentacle-sporting zombies why would anyone expend so much energy on a single person no matter how form-fitting her clothes? Its tempting to say that Anderson is not really in the ""Why?""-answering business. But during the films final sequence the director explains all while also suggesting that the franchises nuttiest days are remarkably yet to come. B?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet At this point the Resident Evil movie franchise has become a personal playground for husband-and-wife team Paul W.S. Anderson and Milla Jovovich; every few years they find another excuse to pit Jovovichs videogame-inspired dark superhero Alice against zombies and other gruesome monsters. Like the Underworld movies the Resident Evil franchise is packed with complicated backstory some of which Jovovich explains directly to the camera at the beginning of Resident Evil Retribution the series fifth entry. But also like the Underworld movies its primary assets are stylish combat quick pacing big special-effects spectacles and a heroine with skin-tight costumes big guns and plenty of biggest-badass-on-the-planet attitude. The series most serious fans will have plenty to pore over and debate in this installment but casual drop-ins and even first-timers will have no problem following the ""Undead dudes go rawr splosives go boom"" narrative. 2010s Resident Evil Afterlife (the first installment Anderson directed himself since the series launch in 2002) ended with Jovovich and a crowd of zombie-apocalypse survivors aboard a tanker ship facing attack by the Umbrella Corporation the author of the zombie/monster plague thats all but wiped out humanity. Retribution puts Jovovich back in Umbrellas hands trapping her in a massive underwater facility where viral outbreaks were staged in city mockups populated with clones. As Jovovich attempts to escape across artificial settings resembling New York City Tokyo and Moscow shes pursued by mind-controlled friend-turned-enemy Sienna Guillory (as videogame mainstay Jill Valentine) and assisted by enemy-turned-friend Li Bingbing (as videogame favorite Ada Wong). Meanwhile Umbrellas ability to produce and program clones lets writer-director Anderson bring back previously dead characters particularly Losts Michelle Rodriguez in a variety of roles. And his connection with series fans prompted him to bring in new fan-favorite characters from the videogames including Leon (Johann Urb) and Barry Burton (Kevin Durand) as well as familiar faces from past films like Luther (Boris Kodjoe) and One (Colin Salmon). For the die-hards Resident Evil Retribution is a sort of class reunion a gathering of assets for the series finale which will only be made if Retributions box-office take warrants it. For everyone else though Retribution is a standard modern actioner in which one supremely talented warrior battles her way through a target-rich CGI-heavy environment against incredible odds pausing to take in and protect a deaf girl (Aryana Engineer) and to face off against a familiar old foe (Shawn Roberts as Albert Wesker). Both these sidelines up the personal stakes a bit pushing Retribution toward having a little more texture and humanity than the average dystopic-future shoot-em-up though that humanity is heavily borrowed from the like of Aliens and The Matrix. And so is the films chilly look though Andersons zippy style (also seen in his other directorial projects like Alien Vs. Predator and Death Race) has its own admirably clear intense but comprehensible kinetic language. The acting is sometimes shockingly bad but generally the script doesnt ask much of the actors and the combat is effectively staged and often thrilling. Nothing here is particularly new apart from the occasional payoff of seeing familiar game characters pop up long enough to get killed by horrific things. But given that the film itself is aimed at little more than being an eyeball-occupier a weekend-waster and a chance for Anderson and Jovovich to share their private role-playing game with the rest of the world it accomplishes what it sets out to do.

Anderson gets into the first five minutes of Resident Evil Retribution running the opening set piece in voluptuous reverse slow-motion with spent shell casings leaping back into pistols and shock troops slurped skyward by helicopters. The fifth entry in the Resident Evil franchise and the third directed by Anderson--one of the few filmmakers who makes 3-D worth the glasses rental fee--Retribution 3-D picks up where 2010s Afterlife 3-D left off with Milla Jovovichs Alice in a pitched battle with the insidious Umbrella Corporations forces. Captured Alice awakens in one of those underground compounds of which Anderson is hopelessly fond a proving grounds test facility made up of ""stages"" through which she must escape by passing through a series of one-upping trapeze-act combat numbers toward a rendezvous point with allies. A submerged world of soundstage set pieces populated by rudimentarily human cloned dummies Umbrellas universe is essentially that of Anderson whose lavish visual imagination is matched to a placeholder idea of character thats almost avant-garde in its generic stylization dialogue buffed of personality by passing through 10000 previous movies. Diagramming every revolution of Jovovich in wheeling and whirling action however Anderson is pitch-perfect when singing the body electric and its impossible to call any movie whose finale incorporates nuclear submarines and a zombie feeding frenzy in arctic waters less than a triumph of the human spirit.

"A dreary Resident Evil Retribution Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview A dreary Resident Evil RetributionAs always Milla Jovovichs game face is admirable but the rest of the sequel is more of the same zombies slaughter and hyperviolent sci-fi.September 14 2012|By Robert Abele Milla Jovovich reprises her zombie-fighting role in ""Resident Evil... (Screen Gems )While ""The Master"" grabs this weeks prestige-movie hype that other Paul Anderson a middle initials W.S.; occupying aesthetic hyperviolent sci-fi a had a film released too.Its the fifth in the ""Resident Evil"" franchise of loud metallic commercials for firing/jumping/throwing prowess and zombie slaughter aimed at that segment of moviegoers ostensibly on a break from doing the same via their game consoles.The other sequel titles a ""Apocalypse"" ""Extinction"" ""Afterlife"" a tantalizingly implied nowhere more to go. But here we are with ""Retribution"" which finds poster gal for disaster survival Alice (Milla Jovovich) once again battling the vicious zombie-virus-spreading Umbrella Corp.This time shes trapped in the conglomerates underwater city-simulation compound where a convenient cloning plot device allows killed-off characters played by Michelle Rodriguez and Oded Fehr to make encore turns in this series stab at something like nostalgia.Sienna Guillory is back too her character now a villainess. Maybe ""Repetition"" would have been a better subtitle.As always Jovovichs game face is admirable a whether giving gunslinger shade or play-acting a protective mother storyline straight-outta-Cameron. But it cant be easy when all around her are line readings that recall the glory days of baroquely dull foreign-movie dubbing.The action meanwhile is the usual stereoscopic 3-D hodgepodge of slow-motion flips sprints swings and bullet trajectories which begs the question If they ran these scenes at normal speed would 95 dreary minutes become a much more expedient 20 to 25?calendarlatimes.comResident Evil RetributionMPAA rating R for sequences of strong violence throughoutRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Hollywood back lot moments Latest movie reviews PHOTOS NC-17 movies Why they got the rating MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESFall Sneaks listSeptember 2 2012RE2 is resident at No. 1September 13 2004Girls just want to have gunsSeptember 10 2004MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowMovieNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-resident-evil-retribution-review-20120915,0,3289929.story",200,residentevilretribution7,residentevilretribution,latimes

Daily Edition Login to download Resident Evil Retribution Film Review 1109 AM PDT 9/14/2012 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Endless video-game-style violent mayhem is on display in this latest edition of the mind-numbing apocalypse series. TWITTER Milla Jovovich once again dons her trademark (and skintight) latex suit in this fifth installment of the popular video-game-inspired franchise. Its easy by now for film critics to identify with Alice (Milla Jovovich) the badass heroine of the extremely lucrative Resident Evil film franchise. Shes constantly being besieged by a seemingly never-ending series of monsters and we -- at least every couple of years or so -- are forced to sit through yet another installment of the mind-numbing series. The film opened without press screenings which seems an entirely reasonable tactic since only the most video-game obsessed viewers will appreciate the endless battle sequences that do an admittedly terrific job of replicating the games artificial visuals with live humans and a prodigious amount of CGI effects. PHOTOS Fall Movie Preview 2012 Major New Releases From Spielberg Jackson Tarantino the Wachowskis Burton and More For those keeping track this installment ends precisely where the previous one ended with a titanic battle sequence aboard a ship where Alice is fighting the multitudinous forces of the evil Umbrella Corporation which is intent on transforming the earths population into flesh-eating zombies. The action then inexplicably shifts to a placid suburban neighborhood where Alice is now a blonde housewife who wakes up to a loving husband (Oded Fehr) and an adorable hearing-impaired young daughter (Aryana Engineer). But it isnt long before reality rushes back in the form of legions of undead who swarm their home. It all naturally turns out to be a dream sequence with Alice then reawakening in the corporations confines clad in -- much to the delight of the teenage boy fan base -- some barely concealing towels. But it doesnt take long for her to don her trademark skintight black latex suit and automatic weaponry to once again take battle against a variety of monsters. These include a pair of menacing giants waving what look like meat tenderizers and numerous creatures with enough tentacles bursting out of their mouths to spur hungry theatergoers into craving fried calamari. VIDEO Resident Evil Cast Reveals Alice Will Visit the Real World Thats pretty much it for the plot in this particularly action-heavy fifth edition that helpfully includes an introductory narration by Jovovich to bring viewers up to speed. Other story elements are provided by explanatory computer graphics that help clue us in to who exactly is fighting who. Featuring brief appearances by enough veterans of previous installments to please rabid fans if confuse the uninitiated the film features man sequences in simulated versions of such cities as Moscow Tokyo and New York all of which not surprisingly emerge the worse for wear. Its all pretty much an excuse for the lithe Jovovich to engage in a constant series of gravity-defying fight scenes in a futuristic universe apparently devoid of carbohydrates and most laws of physics. Shes accompanied for much of these violent exercises by a new sidekick Ada Wong (Li Bingbing) whose dress cut up to the waist makes it convenient for her to access the firepower strapped to her upper thigh. Director Paul W.S. Anderson stages these sequences with his usual flair using a variety of elaborate effects that include x-ray visuals in which we get to see the bloody effects of the carnage on bones and organs from an inner as well as outer perspective. The blase reactions to the violent mayhem from an opening day crowd demonstrated that even the series longtime fans may be reaching their saturation point although a climactic scene in which one of the characters declares that ""this is the beginning of the end"" indicates that at least one more apocalyptic installment will be hitting multiplexes before too long.

Anderson Starring Milla Jovovich Sienna Guillory Li Bingbing Michelle Rodriguez Classification 14A Genre scifi Year 2012 Country USA Language English Videogame-based film auteur Paul W.S. Anderson has said that he wanted this fifth Resident Evil entry to have ""global"" reach and maximal ""bone crunch.""So hes set the film in simulated versions of New York Moscow Tokyo and a generically named ""Suburbia"" within which resistance fighters battle zombies assorted giant monsters and clones under the control of a digital Red Queen the virus-spreading Umbrella corporation or whomever. The word ""apocalypse"" is bandied about in the films first five minutes in case were not tense enough. Screen grab from online trailer for ""Resident Evil Retribution"" Movies Resident Evil Retribution The official trailer Milla Jovovich AP Movies Video Milla Jovovich gets complex in Retribution When necessary the rebel strike team can emerge from a subway tunnel into an unspecified Arctic military installation. Or they can go through an enormous Red Bull energy drink billboard thats parting like the Red Sea and find themselves in a stark white corridor leading to a blood-spattered suburban dream home or a nuclear submarine factory or wherever. Maps or people with information like Umbrellas head honcho Wesker (Shawn Roberts) appear on omnipresent screens when our heroes are in trouble or to feed back stories to Resident Evil newbies. De facto resistance leader Alice (Milla Jovovich) can fearlessly use a pistol in either hand to take out a gun ship and defies gravity while blasting the brain matter from zombie heads.The unlikely is endlessly made possible because everyones within a computer simulation and a plot device that allows for the sudden appearance of things that Joss Whedons horror sci-fi mishmash Cabin in the Woods attempted to satirize earlier this year. Other conveniences include dreams-within-dreams - which Alice wakes from in something resembling an oversized moist towelette. Fans of the series are less likely to be interested in untangling story intricacies than in immersing themselves in the glitzy devastation of primo locales hand-to-hand combat and situations cribbed indiscriminately from The Matrix (unknowingly enslaved masses et al) Inception (a team navigating warped space-time et al) Blade Runner (slatted light demonic neon cityscapes et al) and most explicitly Aliens (a makeshift ""mother"" protecting a scruffy traumatized ""daughter"" from monsters). This material is de rigeur for sci-fi thrillers but fails to fully energize Resident Evil Retribution.Alices maternal devotion to Becky (Aryana Engineer) is given an all-too-brief treatment that characterizes this film. Like an established pizza chain director Anderson is in thrall to a guarantee all relationships of any significance will be established in three seconds or less.Theoretically its nice to see a representation of our globalized world with older spatial and temporal ideas challenged by the Internet and other technologies. We can accept that New York in some sense is ""next"" to Tokyo each subsuming the other. But here such proximity is primarily an excuse to whip the audience from one action set-piece to another none of which are particularly gripping in their own right leading only to a semi-amusing final-act cliffhanger out of left field.Though one heroic sacrifice is absurdly over the top Resident Evil Retributions typically unceremonious approach to heroism is an accidental boon of sorts as is its jokey self-awareness about Alices leather outfit and its sadomasochistic vibe. Curiously a resistance fighter named Luther (Boris Kodjoe) is constantly being emasculated by powerful women. A few striking images keep our attention - like evil warrior Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) seated menacingly with an assault rifle on a playground swing in the burbs. But the films title promises payback without offering ample compensation.

Resident Evil Retribution review Yummy mummy Milla | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesResident Evil Retribution review Yummy mummy MillaMilla Jovovich is back in Resident Evil Retribution the fifth in the video-game movie seriesA double-fisting Alice (Milla Jovovich) takes aim at the dystopic computer-generated everything that surrounds her.  (Alliance Films)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Sept. 14 2012Resident Evil Retribution(out of 4)Starring Milla Jovovich Bingbing Li Michelle Rodriguez and Sienna Guillory. Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. 117 minutes. Opens Sept. 14 at major theatres. 18AMilla Jovovich drop-kicks her way into yummy mummy territory in Resident Evil Retribution the fifth videogame-based zombie apocalypse flick in the franchise.In a rare respite from her trademark skin-tight leathers and nasty bucklewear Jovovichs Alice does a turn in suburbia (clearly a GTA suburb for the latest in the made-in-Toronto franchise) as a jeans-clad blond mom with an adorable little girl.Article Continued BelowIts not too long before all hell breaks loose sending property values plummeting as zombies rampage around the cul-de-sacs devouring brains and baying for blood.How that happens along with the rest of the muddled plot doesnt really matter. Were not here for compelling story; its all about the thrill of the kill and Resident Evil Retribution doesnt disappoint in that department. Any inconsistencies in the narrative are explained by do-overs changing alliances and character-altering serums pumped into jugular veins. Its all the same blah-blah carnage as the first four flicks with 3D effects hurling blood blades and body parts into the audience amid a non-stop barrage of gunfire and explosions.Once again steely eyed Alice stands splay-legged and whips huge rifles from a backpack holster to do battle with monsters that look like a plate of calamari gone rogue drooling zombies and bad guys employed by nasty mega-industry The Umbrella Corporation. The deadly virus Umbrella cooked up for biological warfare gain -- which also turns victims into flesh-eating zombies -- is still out there and being tested on international populations in worldwide sales pitches.Alice ends up doing some globetrotting (of a fashion and in high heels no less) along with new sidekick Ada Wong (Bingbing Li). They stride purposefully down a deserted Yonge St. the high-high slit in Adas red cheongsam revealing a menacing weapon strapped to her impressive thigh. You go girlFight scenes are frequent. Slow-motion digital trickery makes bullets dance and dive while Alice flies through the air vaulting from one victim to the next guns blazing using their bodies like pommel horses.Alice is aided by a few good men some of whom she seems to know from earlier movies. Meanwhile a controlling computer called the Red Queen who looks and acts like a petulant child and a monster who wont take no for an answer make life difficult for the little band of renegades.Writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson knows that this is a franchise that works so why tinker? He stuffs 100 pounds of gore into a five-pound sack and keeps jamming it in. Not content to stick with simple impalements and jetting arcs of blood Anderson ups the ante with x-rays that show bones breaking and hearts being ripped from arteries as the blows land.The special effects are impressive but its easy to grow weary of them making this Resident Evil look like what it is a movie shot on a sound stage with a violent digital world created around it.Will there be a sequel? The last movie 2010s Resident Evil Afterlife grossed more than 280 million at the box office internationally making it the most successful production in Canadian film history.When we last see Alice before the credits roll she and whats left of her gang are standing on the roof of the White House while D.C. explodes burns and is under attack by winged zombies below them.
