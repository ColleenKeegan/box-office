Film  Comedy 5 out of 5 stars (3 user reviews) 0 Love It Save it 3 Add review 0 Love It Save it Time Out says Details Users say (3) 5 out of 5 stars Time Out says Something of a shrinking violet Charlie Kaufman (Cage) is struggling to adapt Susan Orleans non-fiction book The Orchid Thief into a movie. But he loves the book too much and its only when he writes himself into the script that the words start to grow. Even then theres no third act. According to screenwriting guru Robert McKee (who also figures in the film played by Brian Cox) this is your basic education plot crisscrossed with a disillusionment plot but in the broad category of autobiography. The way I see it (and if Kaufman can write himself into the movie I dont see why we shouldnt all join in) Adaptation. represents the absolute antithesis of the McKee doctrine of pre-fabricated story construction and reductive emotional arcs. These guys are thinking way out of the box. The Hollywood-insider jibes cut all the more deeply for the fact that Kaufman obviously feels split about his own gifts and motivations (hence the inspired invention of his crass commercial twin Donald gratefully seized on by the exuberant Cage). But this discursive unpredictable comedy is more than smoke and mirrors. Its truly astute about a certain diffidence which afflicts the intellectual elite (beautifully caught by Streep as Susan Orlean) about the self-consuming nature of obsession and about orchids come to that. For two-thirds of its running time the film is close to genius. But theres still no third act.

Directed by Spike Jonze from a screenplay by Charlie and Donald Kaufman based on the book ""The Orchid Thief"" by Susan Orlean. 112 minutes. Rated R for language sexuality some drug use and violent images. Pacific Place Guild 45th Redmond Town Center. Ive never actually been lost in a swamp but after viewing Spike Jonzes gloriously twisted ""Adaptation"" its easy to imagine the experience. The movie starts quietly and easily as if it knows where its going then heads off in an odd direction then back again -- but now things look different from before so we start to wander in circles knee-deep in murky water and a bit dizzy from the heat of all the ideas and finally give up ever finding solid ground. ""Why cant there be a movie simply about flowers?"" whines the films hero a frizzy-haired screenwriter named Charlie Kaufman. Well maybe there could but it couldnt possibly be as intoxicating as this one even if we do get hopelessly lost by the end. Charlie Kaufman as fans of ""Being John Malkovich"" may recall is an actual person who in real life was hired a few years ago to adapt Susan Orleans book ""The Orchid Thief"" about an orchid collector named John Laroche who prowled the Florida swamps. (Susan Orlean is also a real person. So is John Laroche whose fate is most decidedly not the same as what is depicted in ""Adaptation."" But I digress.) So Kaufman in real life sat down to adapt ""The Orchid Thief"" and quickly came down with a first-class case of writers block. On the kind of mad whim that late nights and impending deadlines can cause he decided to write himself into the screenplay as a screenwriter frustrated by trying to adapt ""The Orchid Thief."" Soon Orlean -- whom Kaufman had never met -- entered the screenplay as well as did Laroche and Kaufmans agent and the studio executive who commissioned the screenplay and many other people including Kaufmans twin brother Donald a fellow screenwriter who may or may not have a real-life counterpart. And from all this madness came ""Adaptation"" probably the most creative and noncommercial screenplay to be embraced by a Hollywood studio in years. Nicolas Cage in an effortless-looking tour de force plays both Charlie and Donald; the former a gifted self-loathing neurotic the latter a cheerfully self-confident dolt. They share Charlies sparsely furnished house in L.A. where Donald all but whistles at his computer and Charlie stares down at his typewriter with a desperate panic. ""OK"" he says to himself fingers poised. ""I need to establish the themes."" The paper remains blank. The panic grows. Meryl Streep has a lovely amused playfulness as Orlean; Chris Cooper minus his front teeth is marvelous as Laroche bellowing out what could well be the best line of this or any year ""I renounce fish"" Spike Jonze directs at a breakneck pace; mixing murky interiors (are we inside Charlies portal like Malkovich?) with sun-drenched swamps. But the star here is Kaufmans screenplay unfolding as if directly from the onscreen Charlies typewriter -- or perhaps Donalds as guns and sex and life lessons begin to invade the story. Whos writing this movie anyway? Never mind just keep writing. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

Photo courtesy of Columbia Pictures In ""Adaptation"" Nicolas Cage plays twin brothers Charlie (left) and Donald Kaufman who are both trying to write a screenplay. Photo courtesy of Columbia Pictures Adaptation gets just a bit too cute 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ADAPTATION Comedy. Starring Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep. Directed by Spike Jonze. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Adaptation"" is a movie about its own creation. Nicolas Cage plays Charlie Kaufman the films screenwriter who is assigned to adapt Susan Orleans ""The Orchid Thief"" for the screen. Unable to get going he blasts through his writers block by putting himself into the movie as a writer trying to write. And so interspersed with scenes from Orleans book we see scenes of Kaufmans creative struggles. Obviously there are layers here -- layers of story of truth of artifice - - and audiences will enjoy peeling them off and wrapping their minds around whats real and whats not. Kaufman who wrote ""Being John Malkovich"" has a clever hand with a one-liner and he has the ideal proxy in Cage whos forlorn and nervous as Charlie and unshakably sunny as Kaufmans (fictional) twin brother Donald. But ""Adaptation"" snags on the fact that neither story depicted -- not Kaufmans and especially not Orleans -- is enough to sustain more than an incidental interest. The movie is better at the beginning when the novelty is still fresh. Charlie goes to lunch with a young studio executive (Tilda Swinton) and sweats profusely partly because shes about to make him an offer and partly because shes pretty. When she offers him ""The Orchid Thief"" he says I dont want to make it an orchid heist movie or change the orchids into poppies and make it about drug running."" He wants to maintain the integrity of the book. The irony of which the movie is aware is that the resulting film (the one were watching) represents an even greater violation of Orleans book than anything any studio executive could have contemplated. ""Adaptation"" starts flagging once Kaufman begins writing. We get scenes of Orlean (Meryl Streep) meeting up with John Laroche (Chris Cooper) an idiosyncratic orchid expert who was arrested for stealing orchids from a Florida preserve. Despite the freedom and physicality Cooper brings to his role and despite Streeps high spirits it soon becomes clear that Kaufmans writers block is understandable. The material hes adapting is inherently undramatic. Whatever sincere interest we might have is further undermined by Spike Jonzes tendency to direct most scenes with tongue in cheek. At least some of the Charlie scenes have the advantage of being funny. But gradually the movies one joke plays out and Charlies doubts about inserting himself into his own screenplay prove to be well-founded. He worries that its narcissistic and solipsistic. Fretting about it doesnt make it any less true. ""Adaptation"" was an idea worth following but it leads to a dead end. In the last half hour when the two story lines come together the movie degenerates into a colossal mess made worse by Jonzes slow pacing. ""Being John Malkovich"" which Jonze also directed maintained its oddball integrity to the finish. ""Adaptation"" gets cute and then cuter becoming a quaint indulgence. . This film contains strong language and drug use.

Sorry Charlie ...By Mike Clark USA TODAY Eccentric Adaptation which deals with conflicting approaches to screenwriting practices what it preaches. An equally odd follow-up from the Being John Malkovich team it has two clashing tones -- one comic one not -- to go along with two clashing Nicolas Cages. Movie review Adaptation ( out of four) Stars Nicholas Cage Meryl Streep Chris Cooper Tilda Swinton Director Spike Jonze Distributor Columbia Rating R for language sexuality some drug use and violent images Opens Friday in select cities Though the darker haywire third act makes intellectual sense it doesnt make much common sense assuming that pleasing an audience is among the filmmakers aims. Thank goodness the storys whimsical sections get more screen time. Cage No. 1 is real-life Malkovich/Adaptation writer Charlie Kaufman who seems paunchier and more thin-haired than his jauntier twin Donald. Hes a fictional creation concocted for the film who nonetheless shares official screenwriting credit. Donald has reason to be upbeat beyond the fact that he has a cute if dopey girlfriend (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Hes on his way to becoming Hollywoods hottest new writer from a serial-killer script hes penning that employs every cliche in the genre. Disgusted Charlie has taken on a tougher task trying to adapt what may be an unadaptable book. It is New Yorker writer Susan Orleans non-fiction The Orchid Thief which concerns flower breeding plant adaptation (the movies title has dual meanings) and a self-made thief of rare orchids (Chris Cooper minus his front teeth). Though Meryl Streep plays Orlean capably this probably will not be another of her many Oscar-nominated performances. But considering the seamy things that happen on screen to her character the real-life Orlean ought to get a 2002 Good Sport Award. Regular moviegoers rarely care for inside-Hollywood portraits but director Spike Jonze makes the movie incisive for a while. Cage gives one of his best performances particularly as Charlie an emotional mess who cant even bring himself to say hello to Orlean when theyre standing next to each other. Cooper expertly conveys unpolished braininess and there are sharp minor performances too. These include The Deep Ends Tilda Swinton as a studio honcho and as a waitress/sexual fantasy Judy Greer (who looks a little like Swinton). For all its wit Malkovich was a grainy eyesore but this movie is technically assured. Yet the wrap-up which turns so intentionally melodramatic that you ""know"" Donald wrote it is irritating and indulgent Theres just no other way around it. Even at its best Adaptation is one of the movie years most esoteric outings -- more so than even Paul Thomas Andersons far superior Punch-drunk Love. Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot.

Thats the premise of Adaptation but please dont leave the building yet. The movie is not another in the lengthening line of whiny screeds about gallant screenwriters oppressed by executive scum -- in this movie the writer has only himself to blame for his paralysis. Nor though it spawns plots and meta-plots like a bunny rabbit is it one of those irritating hipster ur-narratives that keeps winking at you to make sure you get that this is not a true story. In fact Adaptation a divinely nutty and heartfelt second collaboration between writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze (the team behind Being John Malkovich) is based on two true stories. One is New Yorker writer Susan Orleans nonfiction best-seller The Orchid Thief about a crazed Florida orchid poacher. The other is Charlie Kaufmans struggle to turn the book into a viable screenplay. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - On paper the two writers portrayed in the movie by Meryl Streep and Nicolas Cage are a match made in heaven. Both are skittish about plot preferring the mad illogic of real life as source material; both are fascinated by people who live sexier more intense emotional lives than they do. Orlean spent months hanging around Floridas alligator-infested Fakahatchee swamp with John Laroche (played with manic avidity by Chris Cooper -- rangy toothless and emaciated almost beyond recognition) a fanatical collector and sometime thief of rare orchids who lives so far beyond the range of normal behavior that the word eccentric barely covers it. As Orlean charts her subjects monomania and his breezy capacity for replacing one obsession with another when things dont work out she uncovers her own longing for the degree if not the kind (she doesnt even like orchids) of passion that drives people like Laroche. Charlie loves Orleans book but flummoxed by its lack of structure he slips into a funk a condition to which hes no stranger. A joyless balding bag of nerves Charlie is also chronically timid and insecure -- in an uproarious flashback to the set of Being John Malkovich Cages Charlie creeps around unnoticed by cast or crew -- and given to neurotic stream-of-consciousness rants that reduce all listeners to stupefied silence. He is far and away the most maladapted creature in a movie rife with hardy perennials -- from the sexy orchid a parasite capable of endless mutation to Laroche a survivor who retools from orchid collector to porno-site operator without blinking to Hollywood seen early on in the movie as a creature rising from primordial slime to Darwin himself who pops in for a guest appearance. Charlie thrives nowhere but unlike Woody Allen whose schlubs have increasingly become a vanity project -- they always come fortified with successful careers and babes panting for them -- Kaufman takes his self-exposure right down to the bone which could be tedious if he took himself more seriously. His Charlie longs for love with a wispy English classical musician (Cara Seymour) whos getting tired of leaving encouraging spaces for him to declare himself. His professional life is a shambles -- we see him railing at Hollywood philistinism explaining to a puzzled but accommodating executive (Tilda Swinton) everything he doesnt want to put into his movie and stalling his crass agent (Ron Livingston) who wants results. So out of sync is Charlie with his environment that hes forced to collaborate with his twin brother Donald (also played by Cage) who is suspiciously Charlies exact opposite in every respect. A happy pig to Charlies unhappy Aristotle the upbeat but dopey Donald has a way with the ladies. This is insult enough but when Donalds appalling screenplay about a serial killer with multiple-personality disorder becomes a hot property Charlie is crushed. Cycling between despair and false epiphanies Charlie has a sudden inspiration -- he will insert himself into the screenplay -- and flies off to meet Orlean at The New Yorker where he promptly flakes out.

This is already a big chunk of event for a writer who hates plot -- its almost impossible to talk about Adaptation without getting bogged down in its endless twists and turns -- and as things turn out its just hors doeuvres. Desperate Charlie sullenly succumbs to his brothers entreaties to attend the story-structure seminar of the famous Robert McKee (played by the famous Brian Cox) where to his astonishment he gets some liberating advice. ""Your characters must change"" says McKee ""and change must come to them."" The spell is broken and Charlie who has never wanted to do anything but write movies in which ""nothing much happens"" finds himself elaborating a film that plays like some dementedly overstuffed music video stitched together by a hurricane of movie cliches -- drugs sex violence the works. In this florid new scenario Orlean and her book become characters in Charlies Freudian drama whose cast includes everyone he wants to punish or be punished by. This is a good deal funnier than it sounds not least because neither Streep nor Cage is overplaying their hand. Given the choice both actors will lay on the Method -- for which theyre so often pegged as suffering Streep and crazy old Nic. Under Jonzes guidance however they seem relaxed even faintly amused and very very sweet. IS ADAPTATION SELF-INDULGENT? UNDOUBTEDLY. That in part is its subject. To the degree that its a movie about the writing process and the writers dilemma -- caught between analytical detachment on the one hand and obsessive overidentification with ones characters on the other -- Im not sure that anyone other than working writers will care much. But its hard to imagine audiences not warming to this willfully convoluted movies broader themes love longing incompleteness envy family and the desire to find comfort and structure in a comfortless structureless world. In the end Orlean discovers her lifes true passion and so -- following an insight that properly belongs in one of the less reputable self-help manuals but manages to come off as brave and quixotic -- does Charlie. Adaptation is hardly profound but its one of the most soulful and loopily romantic movies Ive seen all year. For all I know in real life Charlie Kaufman may be a raging Lothario with Valentino looks and chicks bearing down on him from every direction. But somehow I doubt it. No matter how many raves the critics send his way the man steadfastly refuses to be photographed. For this alone Im ready to marry him right now.

Although Kaufman found the principal character of the book John Laroche to have cinematic potential he was at a loss how to effect the book-to-screenplay transformation. Eventually he decided to wander off in some very strange directions writing himself into the script and really only using ""The Orchid Thief"" as a jumping-off point. The movie as it turns out is about a screenwriter named Charlie Kaufman who is given the job of adapting Susan Orleans non-fiction book ""The Orchid Thief"" into a motion picture script. Although Kaufman finds the principal character to have cinematic potential he is at a loss how to effect the book-to-screenplay transformation. Eventually he decides to wander off in some very strange directions writing himself into the script and really only using ""The Orchid Thief"" as a jumping-off point. There is a concept in mathematics called ""recursion."" Kaufman and director Spike Jonze have apparently discovered the cinematic equivalent with Adaptation an occasionally maddening and sometimes brilliant motion picture that varies between being insightfully sharp and insufferably self-indulgent. Regardless of whether you appreciate the movie or not its likely to stay with you. An hour after seeing Adaptation I was still wondering exactly what the hell I had seen and whether I liked it or not. Adaptation stars Nicolas Cage in a dual role as Kaufman and his fictitious brother Donald. Meryl Streep is Susan Orlean the writer of ""The Orchid Thief;"" Chris Cooper is Laroche; Brian Cox is Robert McKee a real-life lecturer about the art of screenplay writing; and Tilda Swinton is Valerie the one who commissions Kaufman to write the adaptation of the book. The film flips back and forth across time alternating between the ""present"" in which Kaufman is trying to write the screenplay and three years in the past when the events recounted in ""The Orchid Thief"" are taking place. There are also various flashbacks and even an excursion to pre-historic times. Certain events take place on the set of Jonze and Kaufmans previous collaboration Being John Malkovich allowing actors like Malkovich and Catherine Keener to make cameos. The title of Adaptation doesnt only refer to what Kaufman is doing to Orleans book. It is also meant in the Darwinian sense - that humans adapt to circumstances. The movie is certainly as offbeat as Being John Malkovich although it is neither as funny nor as accessible (if indeed Malkovich can be considered to be ""accessible""). Adaptation has a serious point or two to divulge. In particular its about the importance of passion in every endeavor. Laroches passion is orchids. Orleans one great need in life is to feel passion about something. And Kaufman desperately wants to write something original not generic or derivative. The movie also takes great pains to skewer the script-by-numbers mentality of Hollywood. The final 15 minutes represent a parody of how things would have concluded had Kaufman followed the screenwriters Bible. One intriguing aspect of Adaptation is how Kaufman portrays himself a as a fat balding aging man with such a severe case of self-doubt that he cant bring himself to approach a woman. In reality Kaufman is nothing like his on-screen counterpart nor does he have a twin brother. (Donald Kaufman who is given co-credit for the script is entirely a figment of the real Kaufmans imagination.) I would be interested to have a psychologist view this movie and give an opinion of the man who wrote it. The movie comes across as chaotic which Im sure is intentional. With the multiple storylines theres too much going on and this damages Adaptations structure. Jonze does his best to bring a kind of order to the proceedings but there are times when things get away from him. And there are instances when the movie comes across as being a little too clever (such as when McKees character insists that several techniques prominently employed by Jonze such as a voiceover have no place in any film). I cant imagine Adaptation having much mainstream appeal but for those who look for something genuinely off-the-wall in a motion picture this will unquestionably strike a nerve.

Nicolas Cage in his best performance since Moonstruck plays a nebbishy screenwriter whose talent gets in the way of productivity - and also plays the guys twin brother and fellow scripter whose lack of talent is no impediment to success. The contrivance is so whizzy and clever that even when it tangles at the end the stumble has quotation marks around it.

Todd McCarthy 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr November 10 2002 | 1100PM PT ""Adaptation."" begins on the set of ""Being John Malkovich"" with scripter Charlie Kaufman as impersonated by Nicolas Cage sitting on the sidelines. But the writer has put himself in this ""adaptation"" that is as clever as ""Malkovich."" Pic will be a must-see among film-savvy auds and could attract a mainstream public. ""Adaptation."" begins on the set of ""Being John Malkovich"" the previous collaboration between screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze with the schlumpy self-deprecating scripter as impersonated by Nicolas Cage sitting on the sidelines. But the sidelines are emphatically where Kaufman does not remain this time out as the writer has put himself front and center in this eccentrically personalized ""adaptation"" of a bestselling book that is every bit as clever and surprising as ""Malkovich."" With its sterling cast and anticipated strong critical support Sony release will be a must-see among film-savvy urban audiences upon its release Dec. 6 and with luck and smart marketing could attract the attention of a curious mainstream public looking for something different. One of the many self-reflexive jokes in ""Adaptation."" is that Kaufman whose stack of anxieties and neuroses makes Woody Allen look like a carefree bon vivant has to make everything he writes about himself. How he manages this feat in this case which started out as an assignment to do a straight adaptation of a non-fiction book about an obsessive orchid breeder in Florida represents the core of the film one which is packed with industry references but not in a way unfriendly to the general viewer. Multi-layered time-jumping tale takes a self-consciously analytical look at the storytelling process and centrally at a writers need to passionately engage his/her material -- or not. The ""real"" Kaufman pulls this off by splitting himself into twin brothers Charlie and Donald (both played by Cage). With their thinning hair and paunches they look identical but are otherwise diametric opposites Whereas Charlie is morose depressive introspective anti-social fanatical about the purity of his work and given to breaking out in a sweat in the presence of a pretty woman Donald is casual party-prone blissfully superficial lucky in love oblivious to artistic niceties and pragmatically dedicated to making his work as commercial as possible. The two personalities come into contrast if not conflict when Donald crashes at Charlies conspicuously undecorated Hollywood home to write a multiple-personality-serial-killer script that hes certain will sell big. When he asks his esteemed brother for advice Charlie can barely conceal his disdain for Donalds naive embrace of every overworked Hollywood cliche as well as for his obedient adherence to every dictum prescribed by screenwriting guru Robert McKee. But Charlie can ill-afford to feel too superior to Donald given his own current stasis. Hand-picked by a ""Malkovich""-loving studio exec (Tilda Swinton looking her best ever) to pen the script to New Yorker writer Susan Orleans bestselling ""The Orchid Thief"" Charlie cant find a way into the esoteric material. Nor can he summon the nerve to even kiss a sympathetic young woman Amelia (Cara Seymour) who seems willing to cope with Charlies considerable baggage. So while Donald is in the next room merrily banging away both on his killer screenplay and on ditzy new g.f. Caroline (Maggie Gyllenhaal) Charlie suffers the agonies of creative and emotional constipation. And as we see the material at hand could scarcely be further from his frame of reference. In deftly integrated flashbacks Susan (Meryl Streep) is shown undertaking her own investigation in order to know and understand orchid lover John Laroche (Chris Cooper) for a magazine piece that will subsequently be expanded into the book Kaufman will tackle. Laroche is a unique character an intellectually brilliant and startlingly articulate good ol boy who was arrested for spiriting rare plant species including the prize ghost orchid out of an Everglades preserve. Endlessly loquacious Laroche whose sinewy attractiveness is undercut by a missing set of upper front teeth enthusiastically tells his interlocutor everything she could possibly want to know about orchids. This leads to the breezy but significant introduction of grander themes; in a strand that briefly and amusingly brings Charles Darwin into the proceedings ""adaptation"" comes not only to refer to the book-to-screen process but to the concept of what it takes (for both flowers and humans) to get along in an often harsh world. On a personal level Laroches initially unaccountable zeal for orchids slowly makes Susan realize the lack of a similar passion in her own life and consider what she might do about it. By extension this longing touches Charlie who finds that the only way to surmount his writers block is to place himself in the center of the story just as Kaufman did in real life. Narrative then begins leapfrogging backward and forward even more acrobatically than before. As Laroche movingly reveals his backstory to Susan then takes her into the swamp to find the perfect orchid Charlie goes to New York with the intention of meeting Susan about whom hes begun to have erotic fantasies based solely on her dust jacket photograph. But paralyzed with tension he cant bring himself to even say hello to her during a chance elevator encounter. So Donald who has just sold his serial killer script for some 1 million agrees to pose as Charlie to ""interview"" Susan to provide the missing elements for the script. Reluctantly Charlie takes Robert McKees scriptwriting seminar and a subsequent intense barroom chat with the lecturer provides the springboard to the deliberately melodramatic and violent climax. Brian Cox does an outstanding virtually dead-on impersonation of the confrontational tough-talking McKee although one has to wonder if Kaufman and Jonze originally hoped to pull another Malkovich by having McKee appear as himself. Ingeniously then Kaufman has written an illuminating and entertaining film that at least purports to be about the very process he went through trying to write an adaptation of ""The Orchid Thief."" Ironically the only place it stumbles is in its self-conscious attempt to follow the ""rules"" of well structured screenwriting by providing a conventional action ending that metes fates upon two of the characters that seem cruel and unusual in context. Its hard to know what to make of this clearly concocted resolution involving ""real"" characters toyed with in fictional ways. As in ""Malkovich"" Kaufmans imaginative leaps are perfectly served by Jonzes quicksilver directing style. Able to communicate key information in highly economical ways Jonze keeps the film light on its feet even as it ponders (in a nifty early sequence) the creation of the world or the way nature has matched individual flowers to their perfectly color-coordinated pollinating bee. And as before the vibrant lensing of Lance Acord nimble editing by Eric Zumbrunnen eclectic production design by KK Barrett and charmingly offbeat percussive score by Carter Burwell -- all ""Malkovich"" vets -- are all of a piece with the whole. Simple decisions by costume designer Casey Storm helpfully insure that Charlie and Donald can always be differentiated. Cages dual performances as the twins rep his best work in years. His Charlie is the center of the picture and thesp wonderfully expresses the characters forlorn bearing and pathetic self-image; to go along with it hes let his ""Con Air"" hard body go to an opposite extreme of flabby shapelessness. Although the object of Charlies (and by extension the audiences) condescending scorn the fictional alter ego Donald (who receives official co-author screen credit) ultimately emerges winningly in Cages freewheeling contrasting turn for his can-do attitude and incurably optimistic view of lifes challenges. As a thoughtful reactive woman who spends most of her time absorbing things and turning them over in her mind Streep gives a quietly alert performance that permits emotional revelation in well-judged stages. But all but stealing the film is Cooper who seizes a rare opportunity as an extroverted rather than buttoned-up character to bust loose like an uncaged alligator. Merely fascinating while spill ing his detailed knowledge of arcane subjects Coopers Laroche evolves into a deeply realized figure as he unexpectedly lifts the curtain on his life story. Supporting cast is brightened by a gallery of lively individualistic women that includes the attractively offbeat Seymour a sprightly Gyllenhaal the authoritative Swinton and Judy Greer as a particularly friendly waitress. Director Curtis Hanson turns up as Susans husband while Malkovich Catherine Keener John Cusack director David O. Russell and others appear fleetingly in appropriate contexts.
