Visiting his pimp friend TJ (Eddie Griffin) in Amsterdam Deuce gives up retirement in order to investigate a serial killer targeting gigolos. Could a client be responsible? There are plenty of women to service before he can find out the truth... Ludicrously most of the clients have physical deformities one Chernobyl-reared woman has a penis for a nose. While a South Park movie might have made decent work of such an un-PC absurdity here its juvenile without end. The broad humour is stronger than the gross-out though Deuces wide-eyed forays into pot cafe culture amuse as do members of the Man-Whore Society a group of chiselled gigolos given to referencing obscure sexual practices. The plot unsurprisingly sucks but this alternates between diverting and risible with such enthusiasm that its hard to dislike entirely. Like Deuce himself this comedy is hardly at the top of its field but it should leave returning customers more or less satisfied.

Starring Rob Schneider Eddie Griffin and Norm Macdonald. Directed by Mike Bigelow. (Rated R. 83 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When ""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo"" was released six years ago the movie offended police officers narcoleptics heavy women tall women women with Tourettes Syndrome sex trade workers gay people black people and single- limb amputees. The sequel ""Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo"" pretty much covers everyone else. And although there are a few earned laughs amid the barrage of crudity the inclusion of a female Chernobyl victim with genitals instead of a nose is more than reason enough to skip this comedy and finally get around to seeing that penguin movie instead. This is usually the point in the review where we explain the setup for the movie careful not to give away too much of the plot. But in this instance the title sums up the entire film. Rob Schneider stars as Deuce Bigalow a European gigolo and thats pretty much it. Sure theres a quickie romance and a retread plot focusing on a killer who targets gigolos but both are merely the glue to paste together the main characters twisted sexual encounters. As a ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member in the 1990s Schneider wasnt always the funniest one on the screen but he was always likable. Unlike the grating Chris Kattan who seems like the type of guy who would pull hair and scratch in a fight Bay Area native Schneider is somebody youd want to drink a few beers with. The actors warmth is the best thing in the movie and considering hes in almost every scene youd think that would be enough. But despite some funny moments once the main character infiltrates Europe -- the plays on anti-American sentiment not the sexual encounters are the best part of the movie -- too many jokes fall flat. It doesnt help that a disproportional amount of those one-liners and slapstick moments are at the expense of gay and Asian men. Even the tamest line from the ""Deuce Bigalow"" script would be more than enough to get you fired at KNBR. Eddie Griffin returns as Deuces pimp T.J. and hes a welcome presence as well even though the writing for his character isnt much better. Its telling that the centerpiece scenes for both main characters are memorable for their shock value more than the actual humor. A woman with a tracheotomy spouting wine across a restaurant is one hard-to-watch example and there are several others that are harder to describe including a scene where dolphins attack a group of elderly blind people. At times ""European Gigolo"" feels more like an international incident than a movie. The latest ""Deuce"" also suffers from redundant-sequel syndrome which seems amplified when our favorite characters take a plane ride over the Atlantic. Whether its Clark Griswolds ""National Lampoons Vacation"" family or the casts of ""Growing Pains"" ""The Facts of Life"" and ""Friends"" sending popular comedians on a trip to Europe never seems to be worth the trouble. The Chevy Chase rule of money-grab sequels says Schneider should be headed for a Christmas special next followed by ""Deuce Bigalow Las Vegas Gigolo."" Its a horrible thought but at least it will be interesting to see what he does to offend Celine Dion and the cocktail waitresses at the Hard Rock. -- Advisory While there is nudity profanity and mild violence all of the above pales in comparison to the unspeakably foul scenes involving a woman with a penis instead of a nose.

Eddie Griffin co-stars as an Amsterdam pimp.

Having grown up with parents who cursed in that language I can tell you that ""Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo"" gets it right. And Rob Schneiders return as a male prostitute who cant seem to please anyone in or out of bed occurs in a universe far more clever than the first ""Deuce"" film. His Euro counterparts in Amsterdam for example comprise a ""Royal Order"" that resembles an old-money mens club and they taunt our hero with ""if it isnt Deuce Not-So-Big-Below."" So you have some good one-liners (""Ive got a real Janeane Garofalo situation back there"" says a gigolo getting a certain kind of hair treatment) and some bad gross-out jokes one involving french fries and a toilet. Still what it comes down to is Rob Schneider who is the main problem in every Rob Schneider movie. He is not Billy Crystal an actor of similar size but larger comedic and romantic stature. He also isnt Jim Carrey who can preen his way through the same kind of roles. Schneider has two speeds calculated buffoonery and wide-eyed sincerity. The violin moments such as when he dives into an aquarium to retrieve a cigarette flicked by a cartoonish Frenchman try to inject morality into a movie that should be proudly amoral. (""Bad Santa"" bless its dark soul never feels this need to apologize.) After all the premise is sort of funny. Deuces old friend T.J. (Eddie Griffin) has a tricked-out houseboat called Pimp of da Sea a base for his stable of gigolos. In director Mike Bigelows Amsterdam the citys infamous ladies of the night (or day) are literally window decoration compared with their suave and prissy brethren. Why Deuce leaves Malibu for Amsterdam is only slightly less silly than what he finds upon arrival Europes top gigolos are being systematically killed. T.J. is implicated - not just in the murders but because of corpse-side photos that brand him as gay. In the ""Deuce Bigalow"" universe thats worse than being a serial killer. Deuce returns to prostitution to find the killer and clear T.J.s name. Along the way he falls for Eva (Hanna Verboom) a beauty whose obsessive-compulsive disorder isnt insulting (no self-respecting ""Deuce"" fan stoops to sensitivity) - it just isnt funny. His ""she-johns"" are a carousel of the grotesque including a Chernobyl victim whose sneeze recalls a certain infamous scene in ""Theres Something About Mary."" Schneider who co-wrote the script has succeeded in making a film thats nearly review-proof Most of the dialogue - packed with names for fictitious sex acts and the gigolos who perfect them - is unrepeatable in a newspaper. And the porn star? Well her film within the film also lacks a plot unless you count a dwarf being tossed in a canal. For ""Deuce Bigalow"" this qualifies as character development.

"In tasteless Deuce Bigalow sequel Schneider turns tricks stomachs - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In tasteless Deuce Bigalow sequel Schneider turns tricks stomachs By Janice Page Globe Correspondent  |  August 12 2005 Give credit to the makers of Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo"" for stopping short of having Rob Schneider turn tricks in Anne Franks old attic. Thats maybe the only way this wretched sequel couldve been more tasteless and it probably wouldve been a step up in terms of comedy. Sorry Deuce fans but Schneiders faux-sexy alter ego is back with a thud not a bang this time stirring up trouble in Amsterdam where hes aged about as attractively as a two-dollar hooker.In 1999s Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo"" Saturday Night Live"" veteran Schneider and co-writer Harris Goldberg actually managed some laughs and genuinely sweet moments in the course of their thin-stretched sketch about a hapless Malibu aquarium cleaner who stumbles into a brief flirtation with prostitution. Sure the humor was crass and the Risky Business""-style plot insipid but with the bar set very low director Mike Mitchell at least delivered a fish story that didnt completely stink.This time the director is Mike Bigelow an unknown whose only asset seems to be his close-enough last name and the brain trust of toilet-trained writers includes Corky Romano"" authors David Garrett and Jason Ward.As you probably dont remember the first movie ended with word that Deuce married his one-legged sweetheart Kate (Arija Bareikis) after which the two started a radical anti-sushi resistance movement"" and lived happily ever after."" But that was before anyone knew Deuce would be sequel material. In European Gigolo"" were informed that Kate was actually killed in a shark attack during the honeymoon and all Deuce has left is the prosthetic leg he carts around for companionship.When a mishap again lands him in hot water Deuce flees to Amsterdam to reunite with T.J. (Eddie Griffin) the jive-talking pimp from the first movie who these days lives on a leaky houseboat thats tricked out like a Cadillac. Deuce learns that someones knocking off the great gigolos of Europe and when T.J. stands accused he must come out of retirement to find the real killer.Big mistake.If all the first Deuce"" had going for it was a regular-guy approach to over-the-top humor thats completely absent in this follow-up. Now everythings been amped up and dumbed down (yes its possible) to where the standout performance is Norm Macdonalds cameo.Macdonald is just one of many partially recycled elements The sequel amply revisits the mock slanguage of pimps and prostidudes"" and Deuce again gets paired with women who are giant deformed or have behavioral ticks. He falls for a nymph with obsessive-compulsive disorder (Hanna Verboom) which oddly means hes passing on the gal who spews red wine out of her tracheotomy hole as well as the veiled Chernobyl victim whose nose is a functioning penis.And here you thought tasteless"" was just a word.Not even Schneiders SNL"" career his Adam Sandler connections (this is another Happy Madison Production) or his motley catalog of previous films (The Animal"" The Hot Chick"") prepares a viewer for the lengths to which Deuce 2"" will go to get no laugh. Griffin is reduced to eating fries out of a toilet (a step down from T.J.s earlier hot-tub buffets) and prying a cat off his private parts. Heaven knows what possessed respected actor Jeroen Krabbe (Soldier of Orange"") to take on the role of a Dutch detective.Is it too late to redefine Eurotrash""?

Given Hollywoods proclivity for churning out sequels its surprising that only now are we seeing a reprise of the sophomoric crassfest that was an unexpected hit in 1999. Something fishy Deuce (Rob Schneider) loses his best chum. Columbia Pictures In Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo Rob Schneiders Deuce is older and wiser. He has given up the gigolo racket since meeting the woman of his dreams. They had a brief period of wedded bliss but then she was eaten by a shark. All he has left of her is a prosthetic leg which he totes around devotedly. Yes thats the kind of inane humor were dealing with. But amazingly amidst the smutty silliness there are some laughs. The absurd notion of a ""Society"" of gigolos gathering self-importantly to hold parliamentary-style meetings cant help but elicit a giggle. The group holds yearly awards shows rivaling the Oscars and offers its members a good dental plan. About the movie Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo   (out of four) Stars Rob Schneider Eddie Griffin Jeroen Krabbe Director Mike Bigelow Distributor Columbia Pictures Running time 1 hour 17 minutes Rated R for pervasive strong crude and sexual humor language nudity and drug content Opens Friday nationwide The wafer-thin plot is essentially beside the point. Deuce a naive fish-tank cleaner is lured to Amsterdam by his former pimp T.J. (Eddie Griffin). Once there he resumes his former occupation in an effort to flush out a serial killer of gigolos. The identity of the killer is glaringly obvious and the plot holes are as vast as Amsterdams canals. But setting the movie in that free-wheeling European capital is quite clever. (The ads for the movie misleadingly feature Deuce in front of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Presumably the image of tulip fields or windmills doesnt have the same double-entendre effect.) Deuce is so good-hearted that he seeks to help his clients each of whom has some obvious flaw or handicap that keeps them from getting real dates. But we can do without the saccharine sweetness. Better are some of the sight gags such as T.J.s garish purple houseboat christened ""Pimp of Da Sea."" European Gigolo certainly is not for everyone -- and definitely not for children or kids in their early teens -- and the humor is sometimes shamelessly stupid. But Deuce deux does have its likable if racy moments. A scene thats even grosser than the hair-gel sequence in Theres Something About Mary surely will be the most talked-about. Perhaps the third Deuce will take place in Vulgaria.

"European Gigolo Dont Call Me washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On European Gigolo Dont Call Me Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday August 11 2005 Lord knows Ive tried to love Rob Schneider giving him the benefit of the doubt (and what may well be the best reviews of his life) for ""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo"" and ""The Animal"" two crude comedies that at least managed to elicit a few hearty if lowbrow laughs. Up to now my appreciation of the actor was due in no small measure to his trademark genial-loser persona which seemed to apologize for itself even as it flaunted its silliness. But do I really need to see as we do in the sequel ""Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo"" a woman with a penis for a nose ""sneezing"" into someones soup and then watch that soup get eaten? Or worse yet to imagine that same characters strange endowment getting stuck in another womans tracheotomy hole? (Thankfully this occurs off-camera.) Maybe Im getting too old for this stuff but the new film -- which follows retired male ""prosti-dude"" Deuces (Schneider) efforts to clear his former pimps (Eddie Griffin) name when the manager is accused of murder by the Amsterdam police -- feels less like a celebration of anarchic smut than a joyless entry in a gross-out contest designed for the (presumably) stoned teenage male fans of body-part and body-fluid humor. Sure I laughed. (What can I say? Im weak.) But afterward I felt used and dirty in a way I never had before. As he did in the first ""Deuce Bigalow"" film Schneiders character talks a lot about how his customers want more than a piece of meat. With this latest exercise in cynicism however its not Deuces satisfied clientele but the audience that gets the shaft. Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo (R 77 minutes) -- Contains obscenity partial nudity crude humor sex and drug use and comic violence. Area theaters.

Rude crude and uh cosmopolitan ""Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo"" waves the flag for R-rated politically incorrect studio comedy but doesnt top the laugh ratio of the first Deuce misadventure. Its taken a full six years for the reappearance of Rob Schneiders utterly incongruous dunder-headed stud from ""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo"" so references to the previous pic hardly strike a chord. Mid-August opening slot looks prime for at least a few weeks worth of customers before college terms begin while vid could be orgasmic. New ""Deuce"" was developed by Adam Sandlers Happy Madison shingle and it can now be said that theres a quintessentially Happy Madison kind of movie. It features dumb young white Americans and their even dumber if well-intentioned pals in situations far over their heads who cross paths with enormous women over-confident male villains and almost always someone peeing in public. All are on ample display here starting with fish-loving Deuce who tries to send a sonar warning to fend off sharks at the Malibu shoreline and manages instead to make the dolphins go berserk and munch on unsuspecting retirees. An APB is put out on him just as homophobic pimp and buddy T.J. (Eddie Griffin) phones to invite him to Amsterdam. With the artificial leg of his dead g.f. Kate under his arm Deuce flees to the land (as depicted here) of hookers-in-red-lit-windows canals and unrestricted pot smoking. Though it provides one funny visual joke pics obsession with pot smoking is strange for a film set in the present as Dutch libertarianism is hardly a hot pop culture topic anymore. But at least it serves the franchises best side which is a yen for gag -- and gag-worthy -- scenes and plot be damned. But a plot does surface. Unfortunately it makes the whole movie go limp. Euro gigolo deluxe Heinz Hummer (fine thesp Til Schweiger slumming it big time) is found murdered in an alley setting off a dreary narrative in which T.J. deduces that hell find the killer by using Deuce as bait. This means that Deuce must resume his gigolo act with a string of dates each one grosser than the last. Meanwhile arrogant Amsterdam cop Gaspar Voorsboch (Jeroen Krabbe) predictably concludes that Deuce is a nuisance. What he doesnt know is that Deuce has the eye of his pretty but insanely obsessive-compulsive niece Eva (Hanna Verboom). During the many dull moments under director Mike Bigelows sloppy direction Deuce-o-philes can ponder if the giant woman pestering our hero in the first film was more horrifically funny than the new model a behemoth customer who makes Deuce wear an adult diaper. With its few funny highs pic stumbles along finally deflating even the shock of its obnoxious skewering of a myriad of groups ranging from pro-Iraq war supporters to the French from Canadians to little people. Its exactly when ""European Gigolo"" is sloppiest most random and freely rude that it feels most in touch with its Happy Madison side which will be comfort to some. Schneider has come a long way from yelling ""You can DO it"" in every Sandler movie but he still cant act and has two basic expressions Wide eyes in a dull haze or a slightly charming smile. Griffin piling on the verbal energy is a fair contrast and good foil for Schneider but they hardly rank with the best comic teams. Verboom contributes some cutes while Krabbe Schweiger and Douglas Sills as topper of the Euro gigolo org bring some savoir faire. Pic made with largely Dutch crew in primarily Dutch and other Continental locales is extremely low budget. Oded Fehr appears too briefly reprising his gigolo persona from first pic while Norm Macdonald makes his usual uncredited and amusing cameo bow. Along with late ""SNL"" writer Drake Sather murdered Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh receives an unlikely but nice dedication in closing credits.

Of course you do. Someone bought all those DVDs of the 1999 original and necessitated this sequel Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo. Hes the sweetly dumb ""he-bitch"" who for 10 will date the undatable. He even married an amputee. (Wow) After his bride is eaten by a shark Deuce gets back in the game -- this time in Amsterdam where he must clear his pimp T.J. (Eddie Griffin) of charges of murder and ""gayness."" With Hollywoods gross-out wars fought and forgotten (and the comparatively brainy Wedding Crashers securely on the sex-comedy throne) its nice to know Schneider is still out there in the jungle shaking his French tickler defiantly at the sky. His movie while sloppier than the sloppiest of seconds is laudable in one important regard Its obsession with the male body (the only memorable female character has a priapic nose) provides a ""safe space"" for closeted frat brothers to come out or at least make a ""joking"" grab for each others genitals. In fact this may be the most forthrightly bisexual movie ever made for the American mainstream. The world thanks you Rob Schneider.
