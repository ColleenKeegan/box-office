For their first film production Starbucks plays it safe and sound keeping close to home with gently inspirational family material while capitalising on the apparent national enthusiasm for all things orthographic.Akeelah (the captivating Keke Parker) is a smart girl at a rough school in South Central LA and she tries to keep her big brain a secret from bullies even while she works her way toward the national finals. Its a journey that the movie captures in unabashedly formulaic terms Akeelah gets various ethnically diverse arch rivals (replete with dictatorial fathers) a tough-cookie mum (Angela Bassett in her patented icy irritable mode) and of course a stuffy tutor (Laurence Fishburne who once played Ike to Bassetts Tina) - in this case a tweedy UCLA English professor who as is required in all movies of this nature becomes the youngsters unlikely coach and in so doing begins to heal his own psychic wounds. A warm bath of uplift scented with an honourable message Akeelah and the Bee is essentially a likeable low-key after-school special thrown up on to the big screen where its cliches seem bigger and its characterisations broader than they would on the more forgiving telly By Jessica Winter Posted Monday August 14 2006 Details Release details Rated 12A Release date Friday August 18 2006 Duration 112 mins Cast and crew Director Doug Atchison Screenwriter Doug Atchison Cast Keke PalmerDalia PhillipsLaurence FishburneJ R VillarrealAngela BassettErica Hubbard Users say (1) 1 out of 5 stars LiveReviews|11 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshMay 5 2008paulFeaturedmahFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/83651/akeelah-and-the-bee.html,200,akeelahandthebee0,akeelahandthebee,timeout

Besides that worthy goal -- and supporting it -- is something else very powerful Keke Palmer the talented engaging young actress who plays an 11-year-old spelling champ. Palmer is a natural. You root for her Akeelah in a performance that in lesser hands could have felt formulaic. Akeelah is a smart but unchallenged middle-school student going to a tough inner-city school. During hard times she has conversations with her dead father. It turns out she has a natural ability to spell and a prodigious memory. When a dedicated teacher and principal spot her talentsshe goes from a local spelling competition to state regional and nationals evoking that wonderful documentary Spellbound which showed us that spelling bees can be white-knuckle exciting. Laurence Fishburne plays her dedicated coach and Angela Bassett is her embittered mother too caught up in her own struggles to be in tune with her daughter. Unfortunately the movie creates a rather forced conflict between Akeelah and her mother in order to provide plot tension. But its easy to overlook that contrivance because the movies heart is so clearly in the right place. Sure the deck comes off looking pretty stacked Akeelah is pitted against a super-achieving Chinese-American and is befriended by a Latino boy. Yes they represent a seemingly calculated rainbow of smart kids. But the reminder is warranted Of course achievers come in all colors. You could be cynical about the first movie produced by the coffee colossus Starbucks. But theres nothing cynical about Akeelahs story of courage and determination.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Akeelah and the Bee"" with Keke Palmer Laurence Fishburne Angela Bassett Curtis Armstrong. Written and directed by Doug Atchison. 112 minutes. Rated PG for some language. Several theaters. Watch ""Akeelah and the Bee"" and see something entirely unexpected a preteen girl stealing a movie from Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne. Thats not to say Bassett and Fishburne (reuniting for the first time since ""Whats Love Got to Do With It?"") arent on their game but that the kid is something special. Keke Palmer whos been working in television and movies for the past few years is a natural on screen. As 11-year-old Akeelah Anderson the youngest in a troubled South Los Angeles family she has a sweet and slightly apologetic quality; this is a child whos loved but neglected who nobody has time for. Shes not accustomed to attention and doesnt know quite what to make of it when she gets it. Doug Atchisons film unfolding along familiar lines is the story of how Akeelah finds something that makes her feel special spelling bees. Shes a bright girl who doesnt pay much attention in school but has a knack with words. Nobody knows about her talent until a halfhearted spelling bee takes place at her school. She catches the eye of a local professor (Fishburne) who takes her on as a tutoring project. Soon Akeelah is climbing the ladder of success letter by letter with eyes on the grand prize the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Along the way Akeelah makes peace with her fiery mother (Bassett who can do fiery like nobodys business) and finds a few new friends. Atchison drums up a little drama by introducing various conflicts Fishburnes characters sad secret; a tightly wound bee competitor whose father is contemptuous of Akeelah. But the extra plot devices (and the overdone inspirational score) are unnecessary Theres enough suspense here just in Akeelahs story and the national spelling bee presents plenty of high-noon drama. Fans of the recent documentary ""Spellbound"" will find many parallels here right up to the winning word (the dreaded ""logorrhea""). Palmer smiling shyly in her wire-rimmed glasses makes an appealing heroine whose smarts turn out to be her savior. Frustrated by Fishburnes discipline early on she calls him a ""dictatorial truculent supercilious gardener"" before flouncing off; even in her anger she takes pleasure in words. Standing on the big stage at the national bee tapping out the rhythm of the words as she spells them while her family cheers her on shes finally comfortable -- shes traveled a long way but has finally found her home.

Starring Keke Palmer Laurence Fishburne Angela Bassett and JR Villarreal. Written and directed by Doug Atchison. (PG. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) No doubt ""Akeelah and the Bee"" will be faulted for logorrhea. But unlike many family movies it has moments of pulchritude while showing no traces of argillaceous feet. If anything it is miscible in the extreme. Listening to ""Bees"" young spellers tackle the arcane words in italics its impossible to resist showing off your knowledge the way these smarty-pants do. Whats the point of learning that logorrhea is defined as excessive use of words or that argillaceous means containing clay if you cant toss them into a sentence? The great beauty -- or pulchritude if you will -- of this latest entertainment about spelling whizzes is how adroitly it mixes pearls of wisdom with unadulterated corn. Incredibly the blend doesnt make you gag the very definition (sort of) of miscible. In plain English ""Akeelah and the Bee"" is sweet as honey likable (likeable also an acceptable spelling) and about a lot more than simply the rewards to be reaped from mastering your ABCs. Mostly avoiding sounding preachy it offers an invaluable lesson in the importance of believing in ones self. Its the kind of movie parents will want their kids to see as opposed to much of whats playing at the multiplex. After featuring spelling champs in a documentary (""Spellbound"") stage musical (""The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee"") and a previous movie less than six months ago (""Bee Season"") it might seem there was nothing more to say about precocious youngsters who spout gargantuan vocabularies. But writer-director Doug Atchison has come up with a fresh approach focusing on 11-year-old Akeelah (the irresistible Keke Palmer) a naturally gifted speller growing up in the hood with none of the advantages of the children of privilege who typically compete in bees. Theres a lot more going against Akeelah than for her. She feels compelled to hide her intelligence from classmates at a rough south Los Angeles school to avoid being made fun of. Her father was a victim of a random shooting leaving her mother (Angela Bassett) with four kids to support and no time for frivolities like spelling meets. Akeelah has to sneak off to hone her skills. Her principal convinces an old friend Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburne) now a distinguished professor to tutor Akeelah to increase her chances of going to the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Wash. D.C. (the one featured in ""Spellbound""). Her relationship with the educator starts off contentious when he insists she leave the ghetto talk behind at his house but grows into almost a daughter-father bond. Much of the story line is ridiculously predictable and Atchison directing his first feature film fails to sustain tension over the long haul. Yet ""Akeelah and the Bee"" connects where it counts most on an emotional level. Only a curmudgeon could watch this feisty but vulnerable youngster rack up victories against all odds without tearing up. The filmmakers were fortunate to find a natural to play a natural. Palmer displays none of the self-consciousness to which child actors are prone. She uses downward glances to communicate Akeelahs initial unease around the rich kids shes suddenly thrown in with. One of them Javier (JR Villarreal) immediately befriends her. Palmer and Villarreal make palpable the puppy love that develops between the two ostensible competitors. Stealing a kiss Javier explains that he had an impulse. By that time the audience is sure to also have fallen in love with Akeelah and understand. Fishburne gives a quietly powerful performance as a man still reeling from some tough blows who finds a sort of salvation in his pupils success. Larabee seeks out Akeelahs mother several times to try to persuade her to support her daughters quest to become a national champion. To Atchisons credit he doesnt develop their get-togethers into a romance between Fishburne and Bassett famously paired before in ""Whats Love Got To Do With It."" In this case loves got nothing to do with spelling and would only have been a distraction. Toward the end Akeelahs neighbors pull together to assist her each of them giving her a word to practice. It also took a village to get ""Bee"" made. Fishburne signed on as a producer and in a first for the coffee mega-chain Starbucks is helping to distribute and market it.

Or so it would seem from a spate of high-profile movies whose drama is based on the explosive nonstop action of spelling bees. Weve traded ""The Longest Yard"" for ""The Longest Suffix"" and ""Remember the Titans"" for ""Remember the Teutonic Roots of Common Nouns."" We even have to think spelling at Starbucks these days. As if choosing between a decaf skinny fair-trade caramel macchiato and a double-shot chai frappuccino wasnt enough we now have to spell prestidigitation too. Because your universal coffee shop is one of the producers of todays movie entry ""Akeelah and the Bee"" and has promoted the genial feature film on everything from coasters to posters. ""Akeelah and the Bee"" carefully diagrams every cliche weve absorbed from sports movies urban dramas mentor flicks and precocious-children portraits. Yet it works. Largely on the edgy spunk of young Keke Palmer ""Akeelah and the Bee"" escapes the smarmy clutches of its own stereotypes and becomes a terrific family movie. As Akeelah Palmer plays a smart girl in gritty South Central Los Angeles frequently ridiculed for being a ""brainiac."" This tension between minorities who want to rise above and those who would rather just fit in is the movies most consistent theme. Its tough to concentrate at a spelling bee in the gym when two tough girls heckle with profanities from the back. Akeelahs dad was shot in a drive-by - the requisite missing parent for so many family movies - and her mother works double shifts at the hospital. Older sister is a baby-mama and one older brother is a gang-banger. Despite the cliches theres something about Akeelah. She is smart pretty sarcastic and a survivor. Shell spell if it will get her somewhere. Scoffing at the idea of bringing honor to her shabby junior high she asks her principal ""Why would anyone represent a school where they cant even put doors on the toilet stalls?"" Enter Laurence Fishburne as a reclusive former UCLA professor who seems more interested in taunting Akeelah than coaching her. Of course the professor has pain of his own and Akeelah will eventually sound it out. But these old Hollywood saws are handled adeptly by someone as dignified and talented as Fishburne who clearly delights in playing opposite the lively Palmer. ""Im naturally inquisitive"" Akeelah says. ""Also often confused with being naturally obnoxious"" the professor retorts. To get to the national finals she sees on ESPN Akeelah must first run the gantlet of preening spellbinders from nearby Beverly Hills. One is a cruel Asian kid (Sean Michael Afable) with a heartless father. But another boy of privilege Javier (JR Villarreal) is a true gentleman whose budding romance with Akeelah escapes triteness and offers true charm. Theres at least one more spelling movie to be done. Im thinking a Farrelly brothers parody involving gambling and strip clubs. Until then ""Akeelah and the Bee"" should satisfy your cravings for Americas Cinderella sport.

"In a word Akeelah spells crowd-pleaser - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In a word Akeelah spells crowd-pleaser By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  April 28 2006 Help Our public schools are in crisis. Delinquency dropouts plummeting test scores. Even worse some children are harassed for wanting to broaden their worldviews and fatten their vocabularies. Who will show them that learning is OK -- and show them with flair?Hollywood has a solution Akeelah Anderson the unsinkable 11-year-old title character whom Keke Palmer plays with star-making gusto in Akeelah and the Bee.""Akeelah lives in Los Angeless all-purpose tough Crenshaw neighborhood and her story is the rare feel-good fantasy with its feet on the ground. She doesnt want to sing rap dance run or dunk. She wants to spell which adults in most socioeconomic brackets can confidently encourage a kid to do.She rises from her under-funded underperforming school all the way to the National Spelling Bee. And her success is catchy. By the time its all over even one of her former bullies wants to spit letters.Its unlikely shell do it with Akeelahs style. No one in the history of the movies and in no National Spelling Bee Ive seen has spelled words with her conviction and defiance. She looks straight ahead her head weaving side to side as the letters blast out of her mouth. Shes not just spelling. Shes telling you off.Akeelah has a loving but overworked mother (Angela Bassett) who cant tolerate her daughters passion for the bee. The woman has a hospital job to stress over a dead husband to mourn a soldier son to worry about a grandbaby to dote on and a teenage son to keep from the grubby maw of gangbanging. Poor Akeelah is a rose her mother hasnt time to smell.Fortunately the girls extremely supportive principal (Curtis Armstrong) believes she can make it all the way to the national bee and hooks her up with an English professor who once was a spelling prodigy himself. His name is Dr. Joshua Larabee (tee-hee) hes played by a feeling Laurence Fishburne whos at his haughtiest and holiest and after a few scenes bellowing best.Akeelah and Dr. Larabee have a rocky start. He doesnt like her bad grammar. She doesnt like what a snob he is.Shes too polite to say so but she might also hate that shes the Ralph Macchio in this relationship. The good doctor does more gardening than Mr. Miyagi in all the Karate Kid"" movies combined. In any case before Larabee can say Wax on"" shes devouring words much to his delight.But melodrama is in the offing. Akeelahs family doesnt have a monopoly on the blues. Dr. Larabee has lost a little girl and being in the presence of such a bright kid makes him wistful. Yes the daughter with no father and the father with no daughter fill each others voids. Doug Atchison wrote and directed the movie which is a triumph of cliche-wrangling stereotypes and shrewd packaging (Starbucks is a co-producer and is promoting the movie in every shop). South Los Angeles -- thats South Central to you -- is Hollywoods go-to other side of the tracks. Everybody knows its streets are mean; they saw Boyz N the Hood"" which happened to star Bassett and Fishburne who in their three scenes together here still have an intense sensual crackle.Bassetts character is the classic commotion-causing black mom. And Akeelahs rival is a pompous 14-year-old Chinese-American kid (Sean Michael) whos a foolproof dramatic foil. He goes to a much nicer school. But in his stern racist slave-driving dad he has a meaner parent who has programmed his boy to take down the little black girl. The entire picture seems rigged to make you stand up and cheer.All the gears in fact are shamelessly visible yet they lock smoothly and resonantly into place. If Akeelah and the Bee"" is a generic well-oiled commercial contraption it is the first to credibly dramatize the plight of a truly gifted poor black child.Akeelah doesnt really want or need the attention her spelling brings her. She hides her brilliance in slang and posing. As a lot of smart black kids can tell you thats a survival skill. Knowing too much out loud can get your keister kicked.The movie nails the contradiction gifted students feel in an inhospitable environment. Akeelah skips a lot of her classes because the curriculum is unchallenging. But her friendship with Javier (J.R. Villarreal) a charismatic fellow speller whose family is much better off exposes her to nicer neighborhoods and his more academically rigorous school. In one touching scene Akeelah shows up with her best friend Kiana (Erica Hubbard) at Javiers house for a party. Kiana is so perplexed by the rainbow of happy frolicking kids that she cant even bring herself to get out of the car.Alas the film is full of black children like Kiana whose self-esteem is eaten away by defeatism and a cancerous inferiority complex that seems to pervade the entire community. But in a moment that due to its uplifting preposterousness amounts to an act of magical realism Akeelahs entire neighborhood helps her study for the bee -- from her mother and her mailman to the local gangstaLater in the movie that device is repeated producing one of the happiest feelings I can remember having in a theater. Obviously its emotional propaganda. But its just the kind of propaganda our children need.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

With Angela Bassett Laurence Fishburne. (112 min.)As the latest in a seemingly endless string of movies and shows about spelling bees we have ""Akeelah and the Bee"" a slight but winning heart-tugger about a deprived black girl from L.A.s Crenshaw district who goes on to compete in the national finals. As 11-year-old Akeelah Keke Palmer is a charmer. As her widowed mother Bassett does her share of fuming and as her spelling coach Fishburne is saddled with being Mr. Sensitive (inside a tough exterior of course). Writer-director Doug Atchison isnt very interested in the actual mechanics of how one gets to be a spelling champion which is too bad. Hes more interested in uplift. Grade B- Peter RainerR.V. (PG)Director Barry Sonnenfeld. With Robin WIlliams Cheryl Hines. (98 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Bob Munro (Williams) is told that he must cancel his familys Hawaii trip to put together a corporate merger in the Rockies. To salvage the vacation Bob rents a motor home and takes the wife and kids camping near the site of the deal planning to sneak over the hill when nobodys looking. Complicating life is his ineptitude as a driver and an over-helpful bunch of folk-singing Texans (headed by a drawling Jeff Daniels). Moments of subtlety and wit mitigate occasional tendencies toward gross-out humor and Disney-itis. The slapstick sometimes evokes Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd. Grade B- M.K.

Profanity 13 mild expressions Alcohol/Tobacco/Drugs 3 instances of drinking.Stick It (PG-13)Director Jessica Bendinger. With Jeff Bridges Missy Peregrym. (105 min.)Bendinger who wrote the popular cheerleader comedy ""Bring It On"" has now moved to the world of competitive gymnastics. Seventeen-year-old misfit Haley Graham (Peregrym) is assigned by the juvenile court to do time at a gymnastics academy run by crusty coach Burt Vickerman (Bridges). Haley had once been a junior champion before she choked during a competition and the movie is about her road to redemption. Bendinger wants to have it both ways She plays up the cutthroat competitiveness of the sport but wants us to know that winning isnt everything. Peregrym is a fresh-faced beauty and Bridges is enjoyably cranky but the film is as bland as an Afterschool Special. Grade C- P.R.Still in ReleaseThe Sentinel (PG-13)Director Clark Johnson. With Michael Douglas Kiefer Sutherland. (108 min.)Douglas plays a US Secret Service agent who is suspected of plotting to assassinate the president. Sutherland plays his nemesis.

"Akeelah and the Bee One Honey of a Flick washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Akeelah and the Bee One Honey of a Flick The engaging Keke Palmer plays the young spelling whiz whose mother (Angela Bassett) is preoccupied with her other more troublesome child. (By Saeed Adyani) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 28 2006 Ill never forget my father the product of a classical public education seeing a robin while driving me to elementary school and exclaiming ""Ah The first harbinger of spring"" Harbinger . I was in first or second grade and a passionate unquenchable word lust was born in me that has yet to be sated. That love affair with language is evoked and celebrated with terrific warmth and honesty in ""Akeelah and the Bee"" a thoroughly winning family film. It turns out that the feisty 11-year-old heroine of the film played with remarkable appeal and self-possession by newcomer Keke Palmer had the same kind of dad as I did. And although ""Akeelah and the Bee"" is a fictional story about a South Los Angeles middle-schooler who overcomes obstacles to compete at the National Spelling Bee this by turns funny affecting tale pays homage not just to one young persons determination and character but to all those parents teachers and myriad guardian angels who in real life instill the love of language in young people -- and with it the love of history culture and learning itself. What with the marvelous 2002 documentary ""Spellbound"" the equally well-regarded Broadway musical ""The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee"" the book (and 2005 movie) ""Bee Season"" and the upcoming documentary ""Wordplay"" audiences have been on something of a vocab jag of late. Forget films about 9/11 Does America really need another bee movie? Yes as it turns out. Or put differently If you enjoyed ""Spellbound"" which ""Akeelah and the Bee"" most closely resembles you wont find yourself at the usual cosmeticized dumbed-down version of a much better nonfiction film. Instead ""Akeelah and the Bee"" succeeds on its own terms as an exercise in several genres; this may be the first feel-good coming-of-age fish-out-of-water dramedy of the summer. ""Akeelah and the Bee"" which was written and directed by Doug Atchison hits all of the notes of those cinematic formulas and like a word-slinging ""Karate Kid"" it features a memorable inter-generational friendship. But Atchison deploys all those tropes adroitly and with taste resulting in a film that admittedly goes for the tear-duct jugular (isnt there a word for that?) but earns every salty drop it extracts. In large part ""Akeelah and the Bee"" works because of its uncommonly gifted leading lady. Palmers Akeelah is that cinematic rara avis  the kid who is cute without being too cute sympathetic without being cloying and believable without being tiresome. As ""Akeelah and the Bee"" opens Akeelah Anderson is on her way to school part of South L.A.s understaffed underfunded public school district. Akeelahs smart -- her late father instilled in her a lifelong love of dictionaries and Scrabble -- but her reward is the ridicule of her schoolmates and the benign neglect of her mother (Angela Bassett) who not having to worry about her youngest daughter is working hard to keep Akeelahs teenage brother off the streets. When Akeelah turns in yet another perfect spelling test her principal suggests she enter the school spelling bee; if she advances to the district regional and even national bees shell bring coveted attention -- and funds -- to his beleaguered school. ""Why would I want to represent a school that doesnt even have doors on the toilets?"" she angrily retorts delivering one of the films many subtle critiques of the countrys education policies. Observing all of this from an Olympian remove is Joshua Larabee (Laurence Fishburne) an imposing former UCLA professor who has been brought in to coach Akeelah. ""They laughed because you intimidate them"" he intones dramatically after challenging Akeelah at a school spelling contest. ""If you had stood your ground you would have earned their respect."" Part Zen master part John Houseman in ""The Paper Chase"" Fishburnes Dr. Larabee cuts a suitably mythic figure as the Teacher Who Changed Everything and after a few initial setbacks soon he and Akeelah are embarking on a training as rigorous and rewarding as ""Rocky"" with a thesaurus. During the films most heartwarming montage Akeelah involves her whole neighborhood -- including the gang-banger who has been threatening to co-opt her brother -- as she learns thousands of words for the national bee. Its that nod to the collective -- the idea of victory not just as the result of individual hard work but also as the conspiracy of many supportive souls -- that makes ""Akeelah and the Bee"" so special. And although the idea of a gang leader drilling a little girl in vocabulary may strike a romantic even unrealistic note its still a powerful one. This movie is a triumph on many levels -- not least of which is its notion of triumph itself. But of its many pleasures the most subtle and important is how it presents South L.A. -- a community too often portrayed as pathologically mired in crime drugs and violence -- as strong and hardworking and full of promise. No 25-cent words needed here ""Akeelah and the Bee"" is quite simply great. Akeelah and the Bee (112 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some profanity.

Akeelah and the Bee may spell it out for you but it pulls few punches in its depiction of the hurdles a verbally gifted South Central L.A. 11-year-old (Keke Palmer) must clear to compete in a field dominated by wealthier white and Asian superachievers. Blessed with excellent turns by Angela Bassett (as Akeelahs wary mother) and Laurence Fishburne (her flinty mentor) this feel-gooder revels in its hip-to-be-square hyperliteracy and neatly exceeds its own PSA-ness practically amounting to a black preteen Good Will Hunting.

That seemingly inexhaustible new movie subgenre the spelling bee drama receives its most conventionally uplifting treatment yet in ""Akeelah and the Bee."" Framed around the relationship between an underdog word whiz and her tough-lovin coach this earnest weepie plays like ""The Karate Kid"" with a pro-literacy agenda pushing all the right emotional buttons yet hitting quite a few wrong ones in the process. Overly calculated yet undeniably potent crowd-pleasing elements should spell moderate but sustained returns especially in urban markets when Lionsgate releases the pic April 28 with 2929 Prods. and first-time distrib Starbucks Entertainment. Directed by Doug Atchison from his Nicholl Fellowship-winning screenplay pic reps the latest entry in a cinematic tradition that includes the riveting 2003 documentary ""Spellbound"" and last years chilly psychological drama ""Bee Season"" (and could even be expanded to include legit hit ""The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee""). ""Akeelah and the Bee"" is broader and has shallower ambitions treating the national spelling bee phenomenon as a democratizing force -- a vehicle for self-redemption social change and three-hankie inspirational melodrama. Winningly played by Keke Palmer (""The Wool Cap"") 11-year-old Akeelah Anderson is a gifted but undermotivated student at a predominantly black middle school in South Los Angeles Crenshaw district. Akeelahs desire to blend in cant hide her preternatural spelling abilities from her teacher (Dalia Phillips) or principal (Curtis Armstrong) who encourage her to enter the school bee and then push her into the regional competition with the slim hope that she might go all the way to the nationals in Washington. Initially afraid of either failing or looking like a brainiac Akeelah throws herself into her studies but soon encounters her fair share of obstacles. Her widowed mother (the ever-reliable Angela Bassett) is cranky distracted and skeptical of her daughters newfound passion. Akeelahs also intimidated by her regional competitors from well-to-do families. Enter the gruff Dr. Larabee (Laurence Fishburne) a professor and former spelling champ whose last name can hardly be a coincidence. Played with testy no-nonsense magnetism and a slight paunch by Fishburne (who also produced) Larabee dismisses Akeelah at first but her persistence and dedication ultimately win him over. Duos prickly interactions which gradually thaw into mutual respect and surrogate father-daughter affection form the bittersweet core of the movie. Still pic would have done well not to saddle Larabee with a painful family history that all too conveniently mirrors Akeelahs own. The script overall betrays a weakness for emotional simplification and would feel a lot less manipulative if like ""Spellbound"" it were genuinely interested in the art and mechanics of spelling. But aside from a few well-played scenes of Akeelah and Larabee studying obscure etymologies and developing mnemonic devices pic focuses its highly optimistic gaze on the bees community-uniting impact as Akeelah becomes a local celebrity. Outside that community Akeelah nurses a cute prepubescent romance with rival Javier (J.R. Villarreal) while fending off snide remarks from sullen super-prodigy Dylan Chiu (Sean Michael Afable). Dylans authoritarian dad (Tzi Ma) is arguably pics most questionable creation a stiff Asian stereotype whose dialogue (he calls Akeelah a ""silly black girl"") wouldnt seem out of place in Lionsgates similarly heavy-handed L.A. story ""Crash."" Pics big D.C. finale though overlong delivers emotional sweep and high-stakes drama (plus a few lessons about good sportsmanship natch). Atchison reveals himself to be something of a showman here and while the ending is never really in doubt he wrings an impressive level of suspense from the proceedings that makes one wish the storys other emotional high points were more honestly earned. Going furthest to sell the material is Palmer whose spunky cute-as-a-button Akeelah is all but impossible to root against. Thesp movingly illuminates the pressures facing a girl caught between the ordinary and the extraordinary. Well-lensed in and around Los Angeles by M. David Mullen with some occasional if conspicuous handheld camerawork this is one of the rare films featuring scenes shot at USC that are actually intended to represent USC. Aaron Zigmans musical score offers conventional but relatively discreet support. Final credits were not yet available when print screened.
