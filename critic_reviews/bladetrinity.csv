Comments Blade Trinity Wesley Snipes returns for a third go-round as Blade a half vampire half human trying to prevent bloodsuckers from taking over the world. The only one who seems to be having much fun though is Parker Posey camping it up as one of the vampires. Blade teams up with a couple of other vampire hunters (Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds) and Kris Kristofferson his cohort in the two previous chapters turns up again. But the true costar here is Dominic Purcell as a vampire whos said to be even older than Dracula (though he looks like conventional beefcake) and breaks as much glass and kicks as much butt as Snipes. David S. Goyer who scripted the first Blade movie directed. R 105 min.

Demented stary-eyed vampire Danica Talos (Posey) and her acolytes have resurrected the vampire of all vampires Dracula (Purcell). The shape-shifting Drake as he is now known can take the form of any human. So why choose to look a steroid-crazed East European bouncer? Anyway lone vampire-killer Blade (Snipes) is forced to team up with Abigail (Biel) - illegitimate daughter of his old side-kick Whistler (Kristofferson) - and her guerrilla band of Nightstalkers. The youthful protagonists video-game visuals flip humour and head-banging music are aimed at younger viewers but no amount of frenetic activity can disguise the films utter lack of imagination. Some of the new weaponry is cool especially the ultra-violet arc. Otherwise this has all the appeal of reheated congealed blood.

"Third Blade Is the Dullest washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Third Blade Is the Dullest Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 10 2004 UNTIL NOW the Blade movies (1998s ""Blade"" and 2002s ""Blade II"") were sort of trashy fun. They were rock-stomping hyperkinetically edited music video-flicks in which the strutting coolly sour (and blind) Blade (Wesley Snipes) wiped out legions of trash-talking pretty-boy vampire scum. It was a dirty job but someone had to do it. One shot of Blades mega-zap gun (loaded with special vamp-seeking silver bullets) and poof -- they went up in a Fourth of July flameout. Yeah And then Blade (half-human and half-vamp) would move on his expression inscrutable behind those slick shades. But although writer-director David S. Goyers ""Blade Trinity"" has its share of vampire executions fight action and new characters the third time around feels like it ought to be the last. An overhead shot of Mr. Snipes that suggests -- dare we mention? -- a hint of thinning hair symbolically brings this point home. Of course theres nothing wrong with losing hair or being an aging hero. In fact its a potentially terrific conceit the hero fighting the inevitability of age. But in this case Blade appears to have become host to his own dramatic demise. Forced to work with a group of vampire slayers known as the ""Nightstalkers"" hes cagey and grumpy as if furious that Goyer (who wrote all three ""Blade"" flicks and the second ""Crow"" movie) might replace him with younger talent. In ""Trinity"" Blade finds himself framed. Fooled into thinking hes chasing a vampire he deep-sixes his target only to find the victim is human. Going on the run and hiding in the lair of mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson resembling Willie Nelson 30 years from now) hes ambushed by the FBI and arrested. But the Nightstalkers spring him from custody and Blade finds himself allied (grumpily as I mentioned) with a bunch of youthful whippersnappers including quippy Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and leather-catgirlish Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) who happens to be Whistlers daughter. Hold the phone. Blade couldnt tell the difference between vamp and human? Got busted by a bunch of earthly G-men? A smart aleck with hair gel and a power babe rescued him? Blade you need to talk pension plan with your creator. You are soooo 1998. Old Man Blade and his power kids take on a fairly goofy army including a comeback Dracula (Dominic Purcell) who has reincarnated himself as a gothic stud named Drake; a vampy vamp called Danica Talos (Parker Posey); and a few other blood-sucking lugs (including pro wrestler Triple H). The usual superhero fighting ensues. Oddly Drake who seems to have enough power to eat Blade for satanic brunch constantly avoids going in for the kill. When he has Blade in his grasp he prefers to come back another time. What he has attention deficit disorder? Hes bored with winning early? Or a bad script made him do it? Goyers attempts at camp are flabby and misfired. Poseys indie-gal circus tricks are only fitfully amusing. And as Hannibal Reynolds has an uber-potty mouth that could gray the heads of ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. (Foolishly I took my 12-year-old son to this thinking it might be a tad violent but generally okay. I think he turned 13 overnight.) ""Trinity"" whose title is an obvious shoplifters lunge at the ""Matrix"" mystique is clearly geared for a fourth saga judging by the open-ended conclusion and those hot young Nightstalkers. But if ever there was a case for quitting while youre behind this ""Blade"" is it -- ready to be buried in a vat of garlic. BLADE TRINITY (R 114 minutes) -- Contains graphic obscenity and violence.

"Young Blood Lacks Bite In Blade Trinity washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Young Blood Lacks Bite In Blade Trinity Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday December 8 2004 Watching ""Blade Trinity"" is like being rolled down a marble staircase in an oil drum. The movie is loud dark bumpy and not even a little fun. You emerge into daylight bruised and battered suffering a case of movie abuse. You dont need a film critic; you need a social worker. Possibly that was inevitable but one cant help recalling that the previous film in the series ""Blade II"" had a real director (the Mexican wonderboy Guillermo del Toro) and an epic scale. It was the best kind of pagan fun a celebration of the debauched culture of those who live on blood and those who hunt them given a synth-pop beat and filmed in the dank clubs of Eastern Europe. Wesley Snipes spoke softly and carried a big sword. In ""Blade Trinity"" Snipes talks hardly at all and when he does its with the grumpy bitterness of an old guy who thinks he is entitled to more. In this case he is. Instead he gets less. Like oh so many older guys hes surrounded by smartmouth kids who know it all and hunger to replace him. They all think theyre funnier than he is and better looking than he is and that the movie should be about them not him. What they dont get is that what sells a movie isnt just youth and charm quite common in this world but charisma -- the power to dominate a scene without moving or talking. Thats something Snipes has and nobody else in this film does. When he lets go in full ""Blade"" splendor a fusion of action fury and righteousness hes the best thing in the film. But mostly Snipes is in the background as Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds take the forefront on director David Goyers theory that youth must be served. (I agree though I prefer my youth served over fettuccine with a Madeira cream sauce and a nice chilled pinot noir.) The movie takes off from the shaky idea that Dracula has returned from a millennium or so under the Middle Eastern sands and like everybody who has overslept he wants breakfast Drac -- called ""Drake"" here for some reason and played by the unprepossessing Dominic Purcell -- when annoyed turns from human to demonic form 6 feet 8 inches of ""Predator"" imitation. His mouth looks like something they used to pick up radioactive waste at Chernobyl. Soon enough hes laid up with a colony of high-tech vamps led by Parker Posey at her most downtown languid and they begin to cruise and drain the night away. Meanwhile Blade framed by the vamps for killing an actual person rather than a vamp and pursued by the FBI (a plot strand the movie ultimately forgets all about) takes up with a new set of vampire hunters kids all. The prime funbunchers are wiseguy Reynolds and dish Biel. Somehow Reynoldss character Hannibal King has been designated The Amuser by Goyer so much of the screen time is spent on his ironic quips. Hes one of those guys who always have a comeback. Goyer plays this for laughs but Snipes isnt laughing and somehow you feel his discomfort with his premature retirement; the movie needed more of him and less of the kids. As for Biel mainly she models really ripped abs and shows off her archery skills. But once the action starts everything else stops. Its just one battle royal after another most of it generic all of it forgettable. Bring aspirin and dont say you havent been warned. Blade Trinity (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for bloodshed and stomach muscles.

A twist to events Wesley Snipes character is forced to the background in the third Blade movie. New Line Cinema Some candidate for the director of the FBI already sweating his confirmation process is ambushed by a question from the Senate Committee chairman ""What plans will you implement to solve the escalating vampire crisis?"" In Blade Trinity ( 1/2) bureau field agent James Remar is spinning his wheels over the latest new wave of professional suckers. Merely reacting to events Remar and his colleagues always seem to be a day late and a stake to the heart short leaving the heavy lifting to Blade (Wesley Snipes) and his familiar band of mostly younger vampire-busting associates. (Related Watch a preview of Blade Trinity|Listen to Jessica Biel talk about her role) In the same-old-stuff department Snipes still wears shades even in the night scenes this time possibly to obscure what his acting seems to be saying ""Id rather be reading a soybean catalog."" Kris Kristofferson as a scaled-down old gray mentor to Blade still looks like the visual equivalent of your five worst college hangovers. And theres no cosmetic change in the crews underground work space which still has all the ambience of that warehouse mens room in Saw a movie that shares the same sick green color scheme. At least theres a surprise or two in the casting. In a performance that will have no one saying ""That Jessica Biel can really act"" the onetime 7th Heaven star plays one of Blades guerrilla disciples. Shes pitifully bland but shots of her arms suggest that she put in some heavy buff time at the gym. And art-house queen Parker Posey whose past films probably have never even played in the same multiplex as a Blade movie sports a pair of fangs that add tang to her spouting of vampire vitriol. Most of the scripts wisecracks -- especially the Posey put-downs -- go to Biel colleague Ryan Reynolds who was last seen in Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle. But his college-radio-station-type jocularity clashes with a solemn opening scene in the Syrian desert heavy violence throughout and standard genre mumbojumbo about an ancient vampire come back from a long shady rest. This must be the first vampire movie in which someone utters those supernatural words ""David Hasselhoff"" and the first in which a vampire assailant threatens to pass garlic gas. It all suggests a cinematic identity crisis although New Line Cinema faces no crisis over the prospects of Blade Trinity raking in a lot of box office sucker money for at least one week.

Written and directed by David S. Goyer. 114 minutes. Rated R for strong pervasive violence and language and some sexual content. Several theaters. Given that this is the third film in the series I thought theyd be running out of ideas by now but that isnt the problem with ""Blade Trinity."" Just the opposite. Theres too many vampire plots and subplots here and each is given short shrift. Put it this way If youre going to resurrect Dracula give him some room. For those who havent seen the first two movies or read the Marvel comic book Blade (Wesley Snipes) is a Daywalker a half-human half-vampire who has all the strengths (recuperative powers pointy teeth) and none of the weaknesses (garlic sunlight) of a vampire. Vampires of course want to rule the world (who doesnt?) but Blades been protecting humans for years with his martial-arts moves and high-tech weaponry which shatter fleeing vampires into dust. In the beginning of the film hes killing them with such dispatch I began to root for the vampires. Turns out it was just a trap set by vampire-CEO Danica Talos (Parker Posey vamping oddly). She videotapes Blade killing a traitorous human a ""smear campaign"" is launched against him and the FBI hunts him down. At the same time she resurrects the original patriarch Dracula (an uninspiring Dominic Purcell) to battle Blade. Since Blade is already in custody and drugged and surrounded by agents who are controlled by Talos one wonders what the point is. But then Blade breaks free -- ah theres the point -- and the FBI is forgotten. Now its all set up for the final Dracula vs. Blade showdown. Oh except for the subplot involving blood farms of humans -- which should remind moviegoers of ""Coma"" or ""Aliens"" for the few minutes its on screen. Then it too is forgotten. All three ""Blade"" films have been written by David S. Goyer but ""Trinity"" is the first hes directed. Its certainly better than the second and the script is often tongue-in-cheek funny. Since Blade is the silent glowering hero-type most of the best lines go to former vampire victim Hannibal King (a pumped-up Ryan Reynolds) who along with ass-kicking hottie Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) leads a young band of humans fighting the vampires. But havent we seen it all before? Blade jumps and lands in a three-point crouch. Whistlers daughter adopts a martial-arts pose and then waggles her fingers in a ""come and get me"" motion. A trio of heroes walk toward the camera in slow motion. Our obsession with style over substance is becoming pathological. When are we going to get sick of this stuff?

Photo Credit 2004 Diyah Pera/New Line Productions Ran on 12-05-2004 Blade Trinity Photo Diyah Pera Humor thicker than blood in lively third Blade 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Blade Trinity Action film. Starring Wesley Snipes Kris Kristofferson Ryan Reynolds Jessica Biel and Parker Posey. Directed by David S. Goyer. (R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres a feeling after watching the third ""Blade"" movie that the filmmakers had a long brainstorming session before production started and then decided -- what the hell? -- to just include everything. FBI agents show up in ""Blade Trinity"" along with a Rodney King-style media circus subplot a band of human vampire hunters and a new gang of bloodsuckers as well. And then after half the cast of ""A Mighty Wind"" and Eric Bogosian wind their way into the story the movie turns into a Dracula picture with a 21st century update of the demon prince called Drake. Under the direction of ""Blade"" and ""Blade II"" scribe David S. Goyer ""Blade Trinity"" vows to give the audience a double bills worth of movie in less than two hours and gets a little messy in the process. But theres just enough comforting familiarity mixed with refreshing new characters to hold the casserole of a plot together. Although Internet fan sites spread rumors that the newest ""Blade"" would take place in an all-vampire world ""Blade Trinity"" begins in recognizable territory -- with half human/half vampire Blade (Wesley Snipes) and his partner Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) waging more guerrilla warfare on the underground nation of vampires still plotting to take over the human race. A carefully placed video camera frames Blade and forces the hero to accept help from a young coalition of humans called the Nightstalkers led by the vampire- despising Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). ""Blade Trinity"" languishes until Reynolds appears onscreen and then he acts like a defibrillator energizing the movie with a combination of action film moves and a Chandler-Bing-as-vampire-hunter stream of wisecracks. From there Goyer puts the noir elements associated with the franchise on hold and keeps the fun coming -- this is by far the most humorous ""Blade"" film -- with casting that pairs wrestler Triple H and indie film goddess Parker Posey as scene-chewing vampires and adds fellow Christopher Guest film regular John Michael Higgins in a smaller but no less memorable human part. Snipes has done a lot with the few lines hes been given since the first ""Blade"" was released in 1998 but his stoic character was in need of an Eddie Murphy to Snipes Nick Nolte. Reynolds copious scenes will probably alienate hard-core ""Blade"" fans who will lament seeing the dark material being turned into a ""Lethal Weapon"" movie. But its the best thing that could have happened to resuscitate the franchise. The movies casting doesnt always work. Dominic Purcell as Drake is little more than a stunt double between the scenes where his character turns into a computer-generated effect. Jessica Biel as a Nightstalker who is also Whistlers daughter is almost as forgettable. As the comic book equivalent of James Bonds gadget freak Agent Q Kristoffersons Whistler has always been an underrated pleasure in the franchise and its disappointing that his offspring appears to have gotten every physical and personality trait from her mothers side of the family. The decision to move Goyer into the directors seat was a good one even if his action scenes lean more toward an episode of ""Walker Texas Ranger"" than the high-wire martial arts movie work that fans may be expecting. While ""Blade"" was heavy on blue-hued techno-rave imagery and ""Blade II"" was a horror film that seemed to take place mostly in sewers ""Blade Trinity"" features more daylight than both films combined and is refreshingly free of love interests for its main characters. That leaves more time to blow things up plus a rousing car chase meant for the first ""Blade"" but cut because of budget limitations. And Goyer takes the time to answer a few obvious questions from the past films such as this stumper If the vampires ever ""win"" by turning all of the humans into vampires how will they feed? (Think blood banks on a much larger scale.) The ending suggests that there may be more ""Blade"" films but the prospects seem dim. After Dracula shows up in your vampire film is there anyplace else to go? -- Advisory This film contains profanity scenes of a child in danger and graphic violence.

Musetto View author archive Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) December 8 2004 | 500am BLADE TRINITY (one star) Sucky vampire flick. Running time 114 minutes. Rated R (pervasive violence and profanity). At the 34th Street the Kips Bay the Union Square others. QUICK get the garlic In ""Blade Trinity"" Wesley Snipes re turns for the third go-round as the titular character a half-human half-vampire who has declared war on all other bloodsuckers. Better he should have stayed in his coffin - or wherever he hangs out between screen outings. This time Blade - a short heavily tattooed dude in a long black coat and wrap-around shades - is pitted against Dracula himself (Dominic Purcell) who has been roused from a long slumber in the Syrian desert by a band of vampires led by Danica Talos (one-time indie queen Parker Posey whos terrible here). Helped by fellow vampire slayers who call themselves the Nightstalkers Blade takes on Dracula whos now going by the name Drake in a series of noisy sickeningly violent set pieces. As written and directed by David Goyer who penned the first two ""Blade"" bloodlettings ""Trinity"" lacks anything vaguely resembling a plot while failing to deliver suspense or thrills. Snipes doesnt act - he never delivers more than one simple sentence at a time - as much as pose and swagger. Thankfully hes off-screen for extended periods. If ""Trinity"" has a star its Ryan Reynolds as a wise-cracking Nightstalker who gives the movie badly needed humor. But hes too little too late. Jessica Biel Natasha Lyonne and Eric Bogosian appear to little effect and Kris Kristofferson as Blades longtime human sidekick Whistler is on-screen just long enough to collect a paycheck. Its disturbing to note that the censors at the MPAA have seen fit to give ""Trinity"" an R rating despite nearly non-stop sadistic mega-violence and profanity while handing out a more restrictive NC-17 to Pedro Almodovars ""Bad Education"" for just a few discreet seconds of sex. At times during a ""Trinity"" screening last week there was more of interest happening off-screen than on as surly anti-piracy rent-a-cops patrolled the aisles as if President Bush himself was in the audience. He wasnt. OTHER PEOPLES PICTURES (three stars) ROD Stewarts ""Every Picture Tells a Story"" would make a great theme for ""Other Peoples Pictures"" a documentary about a strange hobby collecting discarded or lost home snapshots. Indie filmmakers Lorca Shepperd and Cabot Philbrick took their cameras to the Chelsea Flea Market in Manhattan where each weekend dedicated collectors rummage through thousands of cast-off pix. Dan an Israeli immigrant whose family was wiped out in the Holocaust collects shots of Nazis doing everyday things. ""Theres this enormous disconnect between their normal lives and what their day job was"" Dan explains. Peter says he likes photo-booth snaps; another man who grew up in Hawaii collects 1930s 40s and 50s pix of the sunny islands; Lewis a gay man prefers homoerotic snaps. Fern sums things up when she says shes become obsessed ""The more photographs you look through you have to look for more."" ""Other Peoples Pictures"" unreeling with two experimental briefs by Bill Morrison is a short (53 minutes) and sweet introduction to a little-known world of eccentric collectors. Total running time (with shorts) 73 minutes. Not rated (nothing objectionable). At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater Avenue A and East Third Street. - Musetto BORN INTO BROTHELS (three stars) AT first glance the children look rather ordinary. In fact they live in brothels in Calcuttas red-light district where their mothers are prostitutes. The lives of several of the children are chronicled in the Oscar-contending documentary ""Born Into Brothels"" produced and directed by Ross Kauffman and Zana Briski. Briski a New York photographer spent several years with the pre-teens. But she did more than just film them - she tried to help them. She gave the boys and girls cameras and taught them how to shoot pictures drawing out hidden talents and offering them a chance to better themselves. Many of the kids showed a flair for photography; 12-year-old Avijit was invited to Amsterdam to show his work. Kauffman and Briski - the kids called her Zana Auntie - avoid the temptation to sentimentalize their subjects. Surprisingly the young people are able to remain upbeat despite their dismal start in life. Running time 85 minutes. Not rated (prostitution).

"The life drains from a franchise - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Blade Trinity (movie)MOVIE REVIEW The life drains from a franchiseWesley Snipes remains strong in Blade Trinity but in the third outing theres not much else to sink your teeth into.December 08 2004|Kevin Thomas | Times Staff Writer As its title indicates ""Blade Trinity"" brings back Wesley Snipes a third time as the black-leather-duster-clad half-human/half-vampire dedicated to eradicating full-fledged bloodsuckers which Blade regards as the scourge of the Earth -- as if our planet has any shortage of scourges. As before Blade is kept alive by Kris Kristoffersons Whistler a scientist/father figure who staves off Blades blood lust with regular doses of his special serum. The last time around Whistler had moved his lab to Prague but now its in an old warehouse in some large unnamed North American metropolis.In ""Blade"" (1998) Snipes took on Stephen Dorffs Deacon Frost a cocky young vampire intent on world rule and in ""Blade II"" (2002) joined forces with his sworn enemy the vampire overlord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) in combating the Reapers a race of super vampires intent on destroying all ordinary bloodsuckers then all humanity. This time Blade must face none other than Dracula (Dominic Purcell) the greatest vampire of all who has risen from his grave yet again dug up by the pale dominatrix-like Danica Talos (Parker Posey amusingly deadpan) and her henchmen Asher (Callum Keith Rennie) and Grimwood (the massive wrestler Triple H).To take on this scary crew Blade teams up with the Nightstalkers a group of human vampire hunters led by Whistlers daughter Abigail (Jessica Biel) and the brash Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). Meanwhile Abigails blind scientist pal Sommerfield (Natasha Lyonne) is hard at work concocting a brew that hopefully finally will solve the vampire problem.As this outline suggests ""Blade Trinity"" has no shortage of dramatis personae -- or of fast-paced action. But David S. Goyer who makes his directorial debut after having written the scripts of all three films inspired by the Marvel Comics series might better have cut back a tad on the slam-bam stuff created fewer key characters and concentrated on developing the reflective qualities that gave the first two films especially the second the resonance that allowed the ""Blade"" pix to rise a cut above most action thrillers.Even so ""Blade Trinity"" has the great sleek dark look of its predecessors and most important it has Snipes a Blade as tough and hard as ever but more aware of his isolation -- he doesnt even have a passing love interest this time out.As commanding as Snipes is ""Blade Trinity"" is not as involving as its predecessors and Goyer seems increasingly to be primarily writing variations on the original. Theres probably enough ingenuity in the weaponry and mayhem and bleak humor to engage genre fans but it would be kinder to retire Blade while hes still at the top of his game than to let him die a slow death of sheer repetitiveness.`Blade TrinityMPAA rating R for strong pervasive violence and language and some sexual contentTimes guidelines Too violent for youngstersWesley Snipes...BladeKris Kristofferson...WhistlerJessica Biel...AbigailRyan Reynolds...Hannibal KingParker Posey...Danica TalosDominic Purcell...Dracula/DrakeA New Line Cinema presentation of an Amen Ra Films production in association with Imaginary Forces.

Call it hyperbolic or overcooked; call it a sham. But it was a sham that believed in itself. It was a sham with the grim determination to kill every pretty thing in its path. Blade Trinity is the third installment in Wesley Snipes brawny vampire-hunter franchise and it still slays them It still stars Snipes as Marvel Comics half-vampire avenger and he still devotes his life to systematically annihilating blood-suckin baddies but that redeeming sense of purpose is gone. In its place are aimless villains and comic sidekicks with too many clever punch lines. In the first Blade most of the vampires were bored 20-something club-goers and their snooty elders; in Blade II they were the victims of uber-vampires with impressive dental work. In this installation theyre incompetent boobs (led by a goth-frightfest Parker Posey) who have the FBI wrapped around their pasty little fingers. In all three films Blade dispatches them with a combination of high-tech silver weaponry that turns them quite literally to dust -- and gravity-defying gaming-inspired chop-socky. Fair enough. No matter what a movies full of if it has people with weird hair punching each others lights out Im down with it. But the problem with Blade Trinity is that the folks in charge have lost faith in the material All thats left is the hair. This latest was directed by David S. Goyer who wrote all three and one might expect him to bring respect for the franchise and its unyielding hero. Instead Snipes rasp-voiced monosyllabic Blade -- he sounds like a spaghetti-era Clint Eastwood with strep throat -- is forced to endure one pointlessly ``funny"" humiliation after another from quack psychotherapy to juvenile trash-talk by a bunch of runny-nosed slayer wannabes. Among them are Jessica Biel as the daughter of Blades old buddy Whistler (maybe his mother will pop up next) and Ryan Reynolds as a crude ex-vampire the kind of babbling protege that no true comic-book vigilante would endure for a second. The result is that Blade such a proud and strapping figure in the first films comes across as diminished. He looks smaller more hesitant He isnt even scary. In most Dracula movies its the vampires who instill fear but in Blade that fear is tipped on its big fanged head. Vampire stories are meant to be frightening. Theyre meant to keep us awake at night trembling with fear at an oversexed man with overlong canines. After Blade Trinity its time to put the gothic back in goth.

"In third installmentBlade lacks fresh blood - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In third installmentBlade lacks fresh blood New vampire fighterscant save dull Blade By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  December 8 2004 One of the prime laws of the multiplex states that any action or horror movie series will devolve into ritualized violence self-mocking camp and egregious silliness by part three. ""Blade Trinity"" is right on schedule.The third big screen installment of the Marvel comic book about a half-breed vampire (Wesley Snipes) going medieval on full-breed vampires is an unholy mess underlit overedited with a glum star and about three too many story lines. Yet the audience I saw it with had a rollicking time because ""Trinity"" steadfastly refuses to take itself seriously. This is bad news for true believers -- hard-core comics fans are not known for their senses of humor -- but it helps everyone else pass the time.The original ""Blade"" (1998) was a surprise commercial hit and Guillermo del Toros ""Blade II"" (2002) was an inspired sequel dead from the punctured neck up but visually breathtaking. With del Toro sidetracked by ""Hellboy"" and its in-the-works sequel its time for David S. Goyer screenwriter on the first two films to step behind the camera. He shouldnt quit his day job.Right from the start we know were in for a . . . special experience because among the gang of bickering blood-hungry vampires is actress Parker Posey usually seen trailing her contempt for humanity across low-budget Sundance-type indies. For this project she has donned fangs and the contact lenses of the undead but truth be told Posey doesnt look all that different and her snippy impatience seems to apply to the script as well as to her fellow bloodsuckers.Theyve banded together to exhume the original vampire a centuries-old demon who is alternately and confusingly called Dagon Dracula or Drake. The last name is most appropriate since actor Dominic Purcell exudes all the bone-chilling menace of a second-string nightclub bouncer.Blade meanwhile continues to fight the good fight against the legions of vampires beating them down until they burst into CGI flameouts. The police are convinced hes a serial killer though and his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) a tech whiz who looks like a homeless guy is nearing retirement.Snipes punches the clock here going through the wire-work somersault motions but delivering his hokey dialogue in a basso profundo drone. The character barely seems to show up for his own movie really and its the appearance of another band of vampire fighters that gooses ""Blade Trinity"" into life. Theyre led by Whistlers daughter Abbie (Jessica Biel from TVs ""7th Heaven"") but the life of the barbecue is Hannibal King a smart-mouthed scaredy-cat slacker played by Ryan Reynolds as if he were Shaggy with brains or Bob Hope in the wrong century. Reynolds doesnt do anything he didnt do in ""National Lampoons Van Wilder"" -- i.e. he fires snotty wisecracks at everyone and everything -- but thank God he does or the movie would be a wake.As it is ""Trinity"" throws in goofball cameos by everyone from monologist Eric Bogosian to actress Natasha Lyonne the latter as a blind scientist who is miraculously able to somehow surf the Internet. Wrestling fans will be happy to see Paul Michael Levesque a.k.a. Triple H as a cackling vampire pal of Poseys and there are a variety of antivampire weapons designed to quicken the heartbeat of adolescent boys. The same goes for Biels shower scene which must have been contractually stipulated.For all the tap-dancing this is the same old same old right down to a crucial plot twist stolen wholesale from ""The Matrix."" Posey and Reynolds are ringers hired to liven up a dull party but even they cant infuse this outing with fresh blood. With ""Blade Trinity"" dawn has come and the partys over.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Blade Trinity | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blade-trinity ) Blade Trinity (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli If youre going to make a vampire movie heres a piece of advice leave Dracula out of it. The character is so iconic that virtually no cinematic interpretation will do him justice. Unfortunately thats not something that writer/director David S. Goyer recognizes. So in order to give vampire-hunter Blade a ""worthy"" adversary for his third outing Goyer elects to pit the hybrid superhero against his old comic-book nemesis (on the written page Blade first debuted in ""Tomb of Dracula"") with unfortunate results. Take away the films attitude and youre left with Son of Van Helsing. Blade Trinity is more of the same. Blade (Wesley Snipes) sees vampires. Blade kills vampires. Blade reloads and goes back for more. The only ones he has any real trouble with are human beings. For some inexplicable reason theyre more difficult to dispatch than the undead. The storyline makes less sense than the ones embraced by Blade and Blade II if thats possible. This time Blade is given two sidekicks the irritating Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) who has a wisecrack for every occasion and the sexy Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) who is the daughter of Blades old friend Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). These three must go up against the king of vampires Dracula (Dominic Purcell) who has been awakened by the toothy Danica Talos (Parker Posey) to implement the vampires ""final solution."" Those who are looking for variations on a theme wont find any here. Blade Trinity is a carbon copy of its predecessors. Its all kick-ass attitude and style without any substance to back it up. Yet where the first two Blades satisfied on a visceral level this one doesnt. That probably has something to do with the portrayal of Dracula who in human form looks more like a body builder than a vampire. When he reverts to this ""true"" likeness he comes across like a rip-off of the alien from Predator. And since all really bad guys like nicknames he goes by the moniker of ""Drake."" I guess ""Vlad"" doesnt work these days. Although the vampires in Blade Trinity arent scary at least they are not emasculated by the romantic notions applied by writers such as Ann Rice. These are cold-blooded killers which allows Blade and his cohorts to dispatch them without blinking an eye. The film features dozens of vampire destructions many of which occur during the films frantic frenzied opening battle which is big on loud music quick cuts and violence. Much of the movie is like that and what starts out as energetic quickly becomes tiresome then boring. Besides we have seen this before - twice to be exact. (Although to be fair Biel is a lot hotter than Snipes when high-kicking her way through a hoard of fanged bad-guys - at least from this reviewers perspective.) The plot is dumb and dumber so the less said about it the better. Its really just a clothesline upon which to hang the fight scenes but that doesnt keep it from dangerously resembling the lame storyline of Van Helsing. (And no movie wants to be compared on any level to that particular blockbuster dud.) This is Goyers directing debut (although he had scribed all three movies) and he steals liberally from previous directors Stephen Norrington and Guillermo Del Toro (who was offered the job on this one but decided to make Hellboy instead). The music is just as loud as in the previous films and the gags and one-liners are more often lame than funny. (Although I chuckled at the fate of the dogs.) The movies bedrock is Snipes who takes Blade to a new level of coolness. Radiating frost Snipes struts his way through the movie never allowing the viewers attention to veer from him. Jessica Biel who has the toughness and sex-appeal but not quite the same presence holds her own but the fatuous Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder himself) falls on his face. As Dracula Dominic Purcell is a putz and represents one of the worst villain casting decisions of the year. Kris Kristofferson is as stiff as the walking dead - thankfully his screen time is limited. Then theres Parker Posey who plays her role as a lady vampire with all the campy subtlety of a drag queen. The target audience for Blade Trinity is the same as it was for the previous two incarnations and it will probably be met by pretty much the same reaction in all corners. As a character Blade is a terrific property and the films have enhanced the creation of Marvel Comics legends Marv Wolfman amp; Gene Colan (both of whom are ""honored"" by an in-joke in this film when an issue of the old ""Tomb of Dracula"" gets screen time). Snipes has made Blade his perfect cinematic alter-ego. Now if only someone could give the character a story worth telling the pieces might all be in place for a great action/horror thriller. But although the saying goes ""third times a charm"" thats not the case here. Blade Trinity (United States 2004) Director David S.

"A stripped-down Blade gets a more inhuman touch - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs A stripped-down Blade gets a more inhuman touchBLADE TRINITY (star)(star)1/2December 08 2004|By Robert K. Elder Tribune staff reporter.Sooner or later all vampire stories come back to Dracula.""Blade Trinity"" the third fang-flashing installment in Wesley Snipes vampire-killer franchise is no exception.It seems that Dracula (Dominic Purcell) was napping in a crypt in Iraq making him the only weapon of mass destruction found there to date.Waking up grumpy Dracula (here dressed like an 80s rock star and called Drake) joins modern bloodsuckers in their battle to control the human race and end Blades (Snipes) decades-long guerrilla warfare against them.In a thickening plot Blade sniffs out the vampires ""final solution"" (notice the Nazi reference) -- a plan to supply vamps with blood world domination and a chance to rid themselves of pesky humans.At the same time Blade conducts biological warfare against the immortal undead when he teams with the Nightstalkers a splinter cell of vampire hunters. Led by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds of ""Van Wilder"") and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) the Nightstalkers vampire genocide scheme involves culling some of Draculas plasma. For all of its current event references ""Trinity"" seems strangely devoid of cultural commentary and Draculas mythic status takes a backseat to an overbusy plot. The Nightstalkers own vampire-exterminating final solution overlooks technology that found a cure for vampirism in the original ""Blade."" But as Hannibal points out what would Blade do without vampires ""Teach karate at the Y?""David S. Goyer who wrote all three ""Blade"" films steps up to direct this one and his stripped down visual style discards much of the muddy computer graphics that plagued ""Blade 2."" Under Goyer less is more as he keeps his fight sequences more fist-and-bone than pixel-and-megabyte. An obvious comic book fiend Goyer makes a strong series debut as a visual stylist though hes handicapped by his own at times bloodless script.Example When Abigail explains how Blades mentor Abraham (Kris Kristofferson) is her father when it was previously explained that his whole family had been wiped out she says ""I was born later out of wedlock.""Wedlock? Who talks like that?Thankfully Reynolds (bearded looking a bit like Jason Lee) adds some scrappiness and humor to a series that might otherwise have collapsed under self-parody. (Almost none of his best lines is printable in a family newspaper however.)In 1998 the original ""Blade"" introduced us to Snipes as the vampire/human hybrid a bloody uncompromisingly violent and stylish popcorn movie. Two films later however Blade is more machinelike less empathetic -- a stone-cold vampire killer under a finely sculpted widows peak.Here hes even more inhuman than his enemies a contrast to Parker Poseys passion as deliriously over-the-top vampress Danica.Snipes still gets to play the cavalry and go fang-to-fang with Dracula although a higher profile actor might have added weight to a villain that seems purely ancillary. With ""Blade Trinity"" Goyer expands the franchise upping the action ante and giving Blade some dramatic foils (Hannibal and Abigail) even at the expense of outshining him.""Blade Trinity""(star)(star) 1/2Written and directed by David S.

Wesley Snipes returns as the titular half-human half-vampire hybrid battling the bloodsucking underground; comic book author-cum-scenarist David S. Goyer takes over directorial reins with sufficient energy and style. New Line release should provide effective counterprogramming to the holiday seasons more prestigious and family-oriented titles earning healthy midrange numbers before draining rental coffers. A decent finish to a middling trilogy -- though the ending leaves the door wide open for more -- ""Blade Trinity"" wont linger in the memory long but gives pretty good action eye-candy while its going. Wesley Snipes returns as the titular half-human half-vampire hybrid battling the bloodsucking underground; comic book author-cum-scenarist David S. Goyer takes over directorial reins with sufficient energy and style. New Line release should provide effective counterprogramming to the holiday seasons more prestigious and family-oriented titles earning healthy midrange numbers before draining rental coffers. Blade-free opening set piece has four well-equipped people dropped in the Syrian Desert where they penetrate a pyramidic tomb waking a Devil-looking monster. While scene fades on the intruders who look like goners it later emerges theyre latter-day vampires led by Danica Talos (Parker Posey) whove purposely stirred the original Dracula aka Drake (Dominic Purcell). Dating back to ancient times rather than merely medieval Transylvanian ones Drake is more powerful than latter-day vamps whose lineage has been weakened by centuries of crossbreeding. He can withstand daytime sun shape-shift and defy nearly any threat. Meanwhile Blade is busy with biz as usual first seen destroying one vampiric warehouse hangout then pursuing the escapees in a lengthy car/motorcycle chase thats too frantically edited to fully exploit its own violence. Resulting spectacular mess worries the heros returning sidekick/mentor Abraham (Kris Kristofferson); such recklessness might expose them to human authorities as well as Nosferati. Blade is duly captured by the feds. But when the interrogation is taken over by psychiatrist Dr. Vance (John Michael Higgins) it immediately emerges the doc is in cahoots with the evil Danica amp; Co. Crashing in to liberate the hero -- and improbably undetected earlier -- are a youthful brigade of ""Night Stalkers"" led by willowy action figurine Abigail (Jessica Biel) and wisecracking Hannibal (Ryan Reynolds) himself a ""recovered"" ex-vampire. After some grousing Blade signs on when they reveal the new threat posed by Drake now CEO-like chief of the vampire corporation. Remainder of the tale is basically a countdown to mano a mano combat between Blade and Drake with the most interesting segs along the way the discovery of a lab where comatose mortals are kept alive in virtual shrink-wrap for long-term ""blood harvesting;"" and a dynamic foot chase through apartment buildings between protag and chief nemesis. The basically pokerfaced punk-goth tenor struck by these Marvel Comics-derived films means performers are stuck posing and snarling their way through absurd situations which results in a lot of no-fault bad acting. Sinewy Reynolds is supposed to be the leavening character but his lines like everyone elses seldom progress beyond cliche and crudity. Nor does the estimable Posey look comfortable strutting through a villainness role that seems tailored for mere bimbo-thesping. A stony Snipes Biel and hulking WWE wrestler Triple H (as a principal vampire) among others fulfill their roles primarily physical requirements. Phoning in Kristofferson at least gets excused from future installments. But then what really counts here is the action and the design package both coming through just fine. While the ""Blade"" series only truly memorable set piece to date remains Part 1s ""rave"" opener current chapter is lively flashy and frenetic enough to keep em in their seats. Impressive contribs from lenser Gabriel Beristain and production designer Chris Gorak continue prior entries red black and fluorescent-white aesthetic. Soundtrack again emphasizes beat-heavy techno-cum-rock with a facelifted take on the Velvet Undergrounds ""Venus in Furs"" standing out.
