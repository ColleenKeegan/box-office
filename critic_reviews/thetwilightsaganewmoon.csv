At the center is Andrew (Ryan Locke) a lean blond alpha-dog investment banker whose beautiful Asian fiancee (Nicole Bilderback) may be his match in the world of business. Among those circling this golden couple are Ben (Colin Fickes) whos gay overweight and addicted to online sex sites (theres a great moment when a trick comes over to Bens apartment and the two men reject each other on sight) as well as the drug-addicted Felix (Thomas Sadoski) and commitment-phobic Tony (Andrew Wei Lin). We have been here many times before (see 1966s The Group) but Johnson and co-writer Ishmael Chawla have a light touch that keeps things from turning overly melodramatic. (No vases get thrown.) Supported by veteran New York actors such as Terry Serpico and Bill Sage the strong ensemble of young actors create fully defined personas thanks in large part to their directors willingness to linger after a dramatic peak and observe the characters in private take-a-breath moments. Hes got something this guy and although Im surely overpraising The New Twenty Id hate to see a movie this ethnically and sexually diverse fade away on todays dead-end gay release circuit. After all for better or worse every generation deserves its own St. Elmos Fire.

A circle of Gothamite friends sweat through hitting the big three-o in ""The New Twenty"" a conventional ensembler that sacrifices depth for sheer busyness. As if taking a cue from Manhattans nonstop 24-hour pace co-writer and director Chris Mason Johnson whizzes through his group of metrosexual/gay/Asian/dweeby young adults with little regard for interesting or revealing character details. A very likely pickup for an indie-oriented distrib pic will deliver modest B.O. and so-so video dates. With some slight tweaks pic could just as likely stand as a TV pilot particularly in the way Johnson and Ishmael Chawlas script steadily jumps between characters and situations by regularly allotting two to four minutes for each scene. The formulaic nature of the project saps it of authenticity that lived-in feeling thats perpetually beyond the movies grasp. Seven years after the end of college the group is already starting to fracture some of it along the lines of those whos been successful -- like Julie (Nicole Bilderback) and her fiance Andrew (Ryan Locke) -- and those who definitely havent like Felix (Thomas Sadoski) and Ben (Colin Fickes) with Julies younger gay brother Tony (Andrew Wei Lin) somewhere in the middle. Julie jokes about constantly getting promoted at her investment firm but Andrew more seriously hopes to launch his own biz. Felix is hooked on heroin while Ben seems to be settling into permanent couch potato-hood. Julie and Andrew appear to be in love but as Andrew latches onto the prospects offered by Louie (Terry Serpico) an uber-Alpha male and foul-mouthed venture capitalist (there apparently being no other kind) the relationship frays. While money cant buy these two love Felix is trying his feeble hand with Lucy (Cordelia Reynolds) but other than rolling around in bed these two dont seem to have much going on. As Andrew tries to jumpstart his business -- what it is exactly is never explained -- Tony meets college prof Robert (Hal Hartley vet Bill Sage) and unexpectedly falls in love though the fact that Robert is HIV-positive makes him a bit antsy. Ben remains Ben a lonely overweight gay nerd pathetically hoping Andrew will give him a sales job and meandering around his apartment between the sofa and his computer. Amid all this these characters remain stubbornly at a distance concepts rather than fully realized New Yorkers with distinctive details and memorable inner (or outer) lives. Pic seems more concerned with just getting through to the other end of whatever minor or major crisis arises. Johnsons cast thus has its work cut out for itself. On one hand these are familiar enough folks in any American big city almost prototypes of the maturing iPod generation. On the other each is vaguely drawn so the actors keep trying to make them jump out onscreen. The only one who comes close is Locke mainly because so much revolves around his character Andrew whos forced to realize he may not be the nice guy he thought he was. Like other similarly themed films pic is also confused about moneymaking knowing that wealth brings pleasures yet sympathetic to the poor bohemians who cant rub two pennies together. Oddly in the context of ""The New Twentys"" run at gay and lesbian fests the gay characters come off as much thinner and less compelling than their hetero counterparts. Production package is fair with a few art-direction details (such as Jeff Koons sculptures) tossed in for au courant flavor. The New TwentyProductionA Serious Prods. presentation.

Director Chris Weitz has delivered a treat a legitimate artistic expression on love loss and the obsessive qualities of initial attraction. Sure it has a few flaws but New Moon succeeds on a level that few films have this year. It gives the people exactly what they want but with an artistic flourish. If youve read the books it definitely works. If you havent? Im not so sure. Its hard to unknow things and you wont find me speaking for those so casually dismissive of whats clearly a generations love mythos. Remember that first person you dropped an ""L-O-V-E"" on? The guy or gal who made you feel angry sad manic and wanted all at once? Thats the vibe of New Moon the eternal theme of first love mined for maximum effect the vulnerability and desperation that comes with caring about someone more than you could possibly care about yourself analyzed and laid bare onscreen. Weitz has tapped into that phenomenon here and he balances well the feelings of suffocation and giddiness that come with the realization juxtaposed with the awful dread of losing it. When Bella is supposed to look distraught she does; when Jasper is in a scene he doesnt just scrunch his face up for unintended comical effect. The film moves along well and there are real moments of beauty here too a crow flying at a third the speed of a vampire running delightful overhead camera work showing off gorgeous visual spectacle. The plot (for those non-book readers hoping to read some tea leaves) involves a quasi-love triangle between Jacob (Taylor Lautner) Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson). The setting is again Forks Washington. The supernatural takes center stage with werewolves and vampires battling it out for Bella supremacy. So then Bella Swan and the gang are back only this time theyve clearly been given solid direction and are up to the task. Theyre asked to carry a ton of emotional weight and they generally come through. Little moments about this film stand out and the interaction between Bella and Edward feels a little more subtle a little more nuanced. Theres a moment early on where Bella reacts to something Edward doesnt say a huge improvement from the monster telegraphs of the first film. The obsessive and seemingly limitless first love of your teenage years feels very well thought out even if its with a vampire even if you happen to run with a few werewolves. Chuck Klosterman recently wrote a strong essay (in his new book Eating the Dinosaur) about ABBA where he discussed the song ""The Winner Takes it All."" Klosterman felt within the confines of a couple breaking up ""The individual leaving takes everything with them."" And thats heartily apparent within Stewarts portrayal of Bella. Shes left with nothing dispatched to a world that is all sharp angles and pain. Klosterman in his essay goes on to expose the fallacy of rejecting something you find ""cheesy"" on those grounds alone pointing out that ABBAs lyrics and style set them apart (in a good way) from almost every band in history. Somewhere in there you can find an analogous comparison to New Moon. Those who would reject the cheese do so at their own peril because the message and concepts presented are ubiquitous and viral. People (myself included) respond to the material for a reason. Acting as though that reason isnt valid simply points to a global and shared hypocrisy -- namely that its fun and easy to taunt the romantic and idealistic. But Im not so sure theres any honor or joy in doing so. Now then there are three elements I have to knock New Moon on  Without knowing the source material this might be tougher to relate to. Having read New Moon it seemed extremely well executed but I know not everyone will have that experience going in.  Director Chris Weitz uses music to cover almost everything in the film to the point where its tough to say whats pulling on your heart. Is it the actors? The dialogue? Or the persistent and haunting noise in the background? As a sucker for music I dont quite trust myself with a film this drenched in tunes.  There are points where the melodrama is a beat too long. For minutes on end things feel authentic but there are a few cringe-worthy moments too. Youll know them when you see them; the audience I was with chuckled a few times when things went a little too far. That said this is the film youve seen in your head if youve read the books. The film comes by its earnest love in an honest manner it does the work to make the characters relatable and dynamic. The notion of how we hurt the people we care about is fused tautly with the supernatural. The werewolves look great and the slowed down (yet styled up) action clearly elevates the work. There are people here who wont ""get it."" And thats fine. They dont connect with the stories and this clearly isnt for them. But the movie looks tremendous the dialogue works there are numerous well-placed jokes and the acting is on point. The fact that certain folks wont be moved is irrelevant; this isnt the way they relate and theyre too far past that moment of having your heart shattered into a thousand pieces. In a way youve got to envy them as theyve already taken the Death Cab for Cutie song to heart. For me? The film worked surprisingly well and Im interested to see the direction theyll take with Eclipse. So long as there are people there will be love stories -- I hope they all feel as lush and lively as this one.

The controversy surrounding Twilight tends to revolve around the question of whether its an allegory about abstinence and if so whether thats good or bad. But watching New Moon the new Twilight saga installment I was reminded of an older culture war. Here were a couple of really really hot guys snarling at each other. The lovely Bella Swan wasnt the only thing they were fighting over. (Article continued below...)Theres something pretty retrograde about the stereotypes in Moon which is set up as a choice between Jacob and Edward. Does Bella want a cultured disciplined cold-to-the-touch vaguely European vampire who worries about the state of Bellas soul? Or does she want a tattooed bare-chested genuine aggressive hot-to-the-touch Native American werewolf? Edward listens to Debussy quotes Romeo and Juliet and drives a Volvo; Jacob fixes motorbikes and wrestles with his friends. Edward wears crewnecks and vests; Jacob nothing but cutoff jeans. Edward is at the mercy of the laws of an elaborate Italian organization of skinny vampires in Louis XIV period costume; Jacob is more or less bound to a roaming buff shirtless gang. Edward might kill her with a snap of his jaws in a moment of desire; Jacob might kill her with a slash of his claws in a moment of anger. (Some choice.)Weve been here before. In 1939 Philip Rahv wrote a landmark essay ""Paleface and Redskin"" in which he described American literature as divided between two poles. For Rahv the paleface wants ""religious norms tending toward a refined estrangement from reality. The redskin on the other hand accepts his environment at times to the degree of fusion with it even when rebelling against one or another of its manifestations."" By example Rahv gives us Henry James versus Walt Whitman. Now the dominant smackdown in American arts and letters seems to be between a beautiful vampire and a beautiful werewolf in a series targeted at preteen girls. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week So Let the games begin. New Moon begins several months after Twilight leaves off. Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) have finally settled into something like a normal relationship. But after a bleeding paper cut causes Edwards brother to attack her Edward disappears leaving behind no trace but Bellas unimaginable and unmanageable grief. Only two things bring any feeling back into her numb mind her friendship with Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) who boasting a hot new physique makes his own romantic intentions clear; and acts of recklessness which seem to summon holographic images of a disapproving Edward. But the apparitions of Edward always dissolve and it turns out that the presence of vampires--or rage--turns Jacob into a giant wolf. After this the film turns into a kind of pseudo-action movie featuring speeding cars through narrow Italian streets wrestling wolves wrestling vampires wrestling wolves and vampires and the appearance of the Volturi the sinister governing body of vampires who are stopped from sucking Bellas blood only by the promise that the Cullens will do it themselves eventually.The Edward/Jacob dichotomy might have made some sense describing as it does (if in a campy way) the dilemma that divides so many hearts. But its a false choice. Bellas heart was ""always"" with Edward she tells Jacob and its obviously so. Despite the fact that Jacob is better looking and kinder than Edward not to mention actually there with her there is no romantic tension between Jacob and Bella. She encourages his affections not out of attraction but because she is scared of being alone. She finds Jacob comforting not confusing. He distracts her from desire.Unlike Twilight theres not much romantic tension between her and Edward either whos off-screen most of the time anyway. This might not have been a bad thing. New Moon could have been as brave a movie as the first which had something simple and sharp at its core. If only director Chris Weitz had managed to tease out the real drama--Bellas fear of aging--instead of a tired one. Growing up might mean growing apart. The scariest thing in New Moon isnt any monster; its Bellas birthday.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Muse With Broken Embraces Almodovar gets his most ravishing performance from Penelope Cruz. _ By David Edelstein Published Nov 23 2009 ShareThis Illustration by Josue Evilla  (Photo Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics) Pedro Almodovars Broken Embraces is a lush deeply romantic noir dense with nods to films past yet it plays as if it sprung fully formed from the directors unconscious. The movie centers on the making of a movieof two movies actually a feature and a behind-the-scenes documentary. But this isnt a movie about movies. Cinema is so woven into Almodovars DNA that he goes past pastiche. Art and life have become thrillingly fused. The story shorn of its convoluted frame is a conventional tragic love triangle. But that framewith its echoes parallelsis the true story. The narrator (Lluis Homar) a blind screenwriter has abandoned his real name Mateo and adopted his noirish pen name Harry Caine because Mateo died years ago. Harry is broken and cynical his only contacts the occasional female pickup; his lovelorn producer Judit (Blanca Portillo); and her teenage son Diego (Tamar Novas). When a bitter man who calls himself Ray X (Ruben Ochandiano) tries to enlist Harry to co-write a sons revenge on his fathers memory the film jumps back fourteen years to when Mateo (not blind) is smitten by Lena (Penelope Cruz) the girlfriend of a rich businessman (and Ray Xs hated father) Martel (Jose Luis Gomez). Martel agrees to finance Mateos film as a vehicle for Lena then dispatches his son to document its makingbut really to spy. In his screening room Martel watches silent footage of the growing love between Lena and Mateo while a lip-reader provides a shattering soundtrack. Almodovar breaks cinema down to its component parts (image sound and editing) not to create some postmodern essay on illusion versus reality. All that fracturing and doubling and mediating suggests how Lena and Mateos relationship is attacked and splintered from all sides. (Thats the meaning of the movies ugly but apt title.) Mateos film Girls and Suitcases is a comedy modeled on Almodovars deliriously campy Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown and when the brutal vindictive Martel mangles it in the editing room its both an artistic crime and a metaphor for the violence visited on the increasingly isolated lovers. Mateo and Lena flee to the barren volcanic landscape of Lanzarote which is sublime but redolent of death. I fear Ive made Broken Embraces sound difficult whereas Almodovar is above all a great entertainer. A director like Atom Egoyan employs self-conscious framing devices to question the medium whereas Almodovar uses them to pull you in to heighten the emotions the way Hitchcock does in Vertigo. His trump card is Cruz. Its easy to see why hes so mad about her. Shes gorgeous she wears clothes like a dream and when shes coiffed to resemble Audrey Hepburn she actually pulls it off And yet shes also astoundingly goofy-looking. Her face reads from a mile away as if her passion had inflated her features to cartoon proportions. Theres nothing cartoonish about her acting though which is more mysteriously contained than ever. This movie is utterly irresistible. Lukas Moodyssons Mammoth creeps up on you and gets into your bloodstream. The thrust is similar to Babel with its suggestion that the world has gotten smaller but the distances between humans more vast. Unlike Babel though it isnt a crock. Its four plotlines feed off and intensify one another. Gael Garcia Bernal plays Leo a child-man who became absurdly wealthy designing online gaming. At the start he flies off on a private plane from New York to Bangkok to make a business deal leaving behind his wife Ellen (Michelle Williams) an emergency-room surgeon and his 8-year-old daughter Jackie. Ellen barely sees Jackie The girl is left in the care of a nanny Gloria (Marife Necesito) who left her own two young sons in the Philippines to earn money to give them a better life. As those boys cry for their absent mother Gloria (wracked by maternal guilt) functions as a loving surrogate mom to Jackie while Ellen (also wracked by maternal guilt) labors to save the life of a boy stabbed by his own mother. Leo comes face to face with young Thai women forced into lives of prostitution. Too many films exploit the perils faced by children when the social contract is ruptured but Mammoth earns its cruel sensationalistic turns and then some. In the flawless cast Williams is the most affecting as a selfless woman doing so much right yet like her world profoundly out of balance. Mass hysteria has turned The Twilight Saga New Moona turgid romantic horror film that under different circumstances would barely attract noticeinto the biggest event of the millennium. Which isnt such a bad thing. I loved watching it with an audience that screamed when Bella (Kristen Stewart) and the vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) first appear. The essential dullness came later. The last one Twilight was fun but shallow compared with the momentous adolescent hormonal feelings flooding Stephenie Meyers novel. In New Moon director Chris Weitz tries to slow things down which means the unrequited lovers stare longingly at each other and just wont say their lines. The hook for young girls is the fantasy of men fighting over them. First two vampires fight over Bella then two werewolves. Then werewolves fight vampires. Then a vampire fights more vampires. Bella saves Edward Edward saves Bella and the Native American werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) tries to save Bella from Edward. Whereas Edward is a pale aesthete with the highest brow in movies Jacob is a dark hairy biker dude with a very low brow and a trapezius the size of a watermelon. He looks like a Nautilized caveman. Stewart is lovely and believable but Pattinson is better in gorgeous repose than when he speaks. The movie has a few good flourishes like the werewolves whooshy overhead chase of an evil red-haired vampire woman. But Weitzs pacing is so limp youre going to need the electricity generated by a live audience to keep from yelling Hurry it up Broken Embraces Directed by Pedro Almodovar. Sony Pictures Classics. R.

By Peter Rainer November 20 2009 Save for later Saved Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen (l.) and Kristen Stewart as Bella Swan in a scene from ""The Twilight Saga New Moon."" Kimberley French/Summit Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? It probably wont make a jot of difference to all the screaming tweeners lining up to see this movie but ""The Twilight Saga New Moon"" is not wonderful. Allusions in this film to Shakespeares ""Romeo and Juliet"" abound but greatness by association has never been less plausible. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) continues to have poor choice in men or to be more exact men-boys or the undead or werewolves - whatever. Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) is looking pastier than ever which I guess along with his jutting jaw and bad-boy swagger is a good thing. Vampirism becomes him. Hes not in the movie nearly enough though. His rival in Bellas affections is the newly buff Jacob ""Jake"" Black (Taylor Lautner) who is more like an incipient Michelin Man than a nascent werewolf. (With his six-pack abs Budweiser missed a product-placement bonanza with this guy.) Since ""New Moon"" is a transitional piece in the Stephenie Meyer ""Twilight"" franchise it often bogs down in exposition. Memo to director Chris Weitz and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg Just because you make a movie about vampires doesnt mean you suck the life out of your story.

Comments click to enlarge The Twilight Saga New Moon Free Rated PG-13  130 minutes  2009 In the supernatural romance Twilight (2008) high school senior Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her 109-year-old vampire boyfriend Edward (Robert Pattinson) maintained a love affair so chaste it would make Victorians seem freaky. This sequel finds the stress getting to them and after Edward bails on Bella she turns into a codependent drip relying on the attentions of men to give her life shape and putting herself in danger just to be rescued by them. Saving the day (and the movie) is her werewolf BFF Jacob (Taylor Lautner). The movies script and production values represent a big step up from the nearly unwatchable predecessor and make it suitable viewing even for people who arent Twilight nerds.

When pallid principled vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) leaves town his chaste girlfriend Bella (Kristen Stewart) moons and mourns for months. The usual teen pursuits dont interest her she sneers at shopping and only opts for sport or cinema if they bring her closer to Edward. Then solace arrives in the bulging biceps of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) Bellas childhood friend-turned-boy-hulk.Its not exactly a celebration of female independence but New Moon still has an expert handle on its young audience. Near-kisses and sexual frustration abound. Boys become attractive yet also dangerous when they come of age - and the good ones keep the monsters in check. This time the monsters arent merely vampires but werewolves spectacular CG creatures that snarl and pounce their way through several enjoyable action sequences then transform back into buff topless young studs... Yep New Moon knows what its doing.Plot-wise its a slow starter but gains momentum when Bella develops a taste for adrenaline in the hope of catching a glimpse of her vampiric protector. Motorbike rides and deathly dives follow along with a scenic race to Italy to meet uber-vampire Michael Sheen (always a pleasure). Welcome comedy comes from Bellas schoolmates notably Jessica (Anna Kendrick) who wearily deconstructs the symbolism in zombie movies while bemoaning the lack of hot guys. Is this New Moon defending its fanbase and pre-empting criticism about its transparent agenda? Natalie and Bella are intelligent young women yet ruled by their hormones - plenty of room for audience identification there.  New Moon is little more than a skilful soap opera but its still enjoyable escapism - even if youre old and wise enough to see through it.

Big fan of the book and whilst edward and jacob are good ) Kristen Stewart is rubbish. Maybe she can act but not in this film. She just over blinkssighs and stutters the whole time. The worst part is when the volturi are about to kill edward ( which would never happen as he can read minds and would be able to escape) and she scream for them not to. Just watch that part..its so cringe worthy She made the film hard to watch. Bella is more emotional than how kristen acts which is why i dont think she should be bella. The film was pointless really....FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 4 2010John CooperFeaturedYes three stars is about right for this tasteful offering to the mindset of teeenage adolescence. The movie skilfully enters the self-centred obsessional world of teenage angst . . . where the real world is replaced by one in which vampires and werewolves are the principal peer groups . However what gives the film its superior class is the music of Alexandre Desplat . . . . . which is beautfifully orchestrated in the final sequence and the credits.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 2 2010JohannaFeaturedTwilight was good; entertaining well stylised and not as nauseating as I expected. New Moon however was a disappointment; far too long with a corny script and some amazingly wooden acting - most notably by (gratuitously topless for most of the film) Taylor Lautner. Cringe worthy scenes of him taking off his t-shirt running towards camera his glossy locks flowing behind him like hes just had a promotional Pantene experience prompted loud laughter from the audience. It was a packed cinema and I think everyone who wasnt comatose by this point had a hearty chuckle. However bravo to Kristen Stewart who did sulky so well and Robert Pattinson who makes an iron deficiency look very attractive. In sum I wouldnt waste your money going to see it unless you have an irresistible urge to self-harm. Even then there are cheaper and less enduring ways to do so.

At least i didnt have to put up with Ed making faces for the 1st half.

Its very slow and in some moments boring. I can feel the lack of the music which was absolutely GREAT in the first one. Since Im a HUGE fan of these books I must say that Catherine did a better job on building an emotion and Chris is better for the action parts...

Book 2 is very slow and not my favourite in the series and I guess thats why this film also feels a bit slow. Story doesnt get going properly for ages and and some stage I even looked at my watch I was also expecting to see more on the wolf pack (dynamics in the pack and Jakes struggle) and though Edward was just a big misery. Oh he is just annoying me endlessly. Then the music to this film - Twilight was so fab - what a good soundtrack it had New Moon was boring and tedious - all this violin stuff and the music did not set the scene (like it did in Twilight). The special effects were also pretty awful - the wolfes - I dont know... expected more On the good side - loved Taylor Lautner as Jake. He is just how I imagine him and I think his acting was pretty good. And wow - did he look good The taking of the shirt sequence will stay with me forever ;-) So somehow a bit disappointed but kind of expected it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 26 2009bellaFeaturededward rocks my worldFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 26 2009bellaFeaturededward rocks my worldFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 25 2009siobhanFeaturedThis was boring....I havent read the books so I didnt know what was going to happen and I still thought this was lame....

Kristen Stewart is really beautiful. ... The good- Kristen Stewart is beautiful. The vampire aesthetic in this film as in the first one is awesome. ... The bad- The pacing of this film is all wrong and the plot comes across as contrived. The film starts out far too slow almost directionless and verging on boring then it suddenly seems to rush things and gloss over things that could have been handled with greater depth and dramatic sensitivity like the question as to the loss of ones soul for instance. Some of the acting especially in some of the more emotion-driven scenes is a little wooden. Maybe it would be accurate as a representation of teenagers but Edward Cullen is supposed to be 109 years old. ... The ugly- Some of the computer graphics are just terrible - particularly in the second half of the scene with the vampire with dreadlocks. Without wanting to spoil things [MINI-SPOILER ALERT]- ... ... the creatures that you see which are supposed to look vaguely realistic - just dont. Its really awful. ... And dont get me started on the vision of Edward and Bella practically skipping through the woods. The audience actually broke out in fits of [deeply inappropriate] laughter at that point. ... Its really difficult to rate this film. I enjoyed it and it is far far better than the Vampires Assistant. But its still a deeply flawed film and a poor sequel to the first Twilight movie.

There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. the first movie captured the raw emotions of teenage angst love and sexual tension which is what made it so beautiful to watch. The movie is based on a book so they should have focused on the characters and the dialogue more then they did on the special effects.

"Love Happens | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Love Happens Print Page Email Page Search Love Happens (2009; Rated ) D- "" Dreadful."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Love Happens(2009; PG-13)In theaters Friday 18 September 2009 Summary About a widower whose book about coping with loss turns him into a best-selling self-help guru. On a business trip to Seattle he falls for a woman who attends one of his seminars only to learn that he hasnt yet truly confronted his wifes passing. Genre Drama RomanceDirector Brandon CampCast Aaron Eckhart Jennifer Aniston Sometimes when you least expect it ... Love Happens."" Thats the advertising tagline for this movie. Doesnt it sound like the first line of a parody sketch? You can even hear Mister Movie Trailer Man booming ""Sometimes when you least expect it ... Love Happens."" Yipes. From the awful title to the uninspired casting of Jennifer Aniston in a role shes played a half-dozen times before from the wisecracking best friends to the most shameless weeper scene in recent memory ""Love Happens"" is a movie that grates on the nerves like a cell phone with a Lady Gaga ringtone going off at a funeral service. And we havent even discussed the parrot yet. My problems with this film started early on when Aaron Eckharts Burke ""meets cute"" with Anistons Eloise. They bump into each other in a hotel hallway. Literally. Really? Youre filming a romance and youre actually going to have the leads meet by bumping into each other? Why not just call your movie ""Cliches Happen""? Eckhart excels at playing charming rogues (""Thank You for Smoking"") but hes miscast as a sensitive widower who has written a best-seller about the grieving process and is now touring the country giving pep talks and conducting workshops. With his Redfordian hair his Zegna suits and his at-the-gym-every-day physique Eckhart comes across more like an upscale gigolo than a guy whos gonna hold your hand as you pine for your dearly departed loved one. Aniston plays Eloise who owns a flower shop and has a habit of scribbling obscure words such as ""quidnunc"" on the walls behind paintings in hotels. Why? Because the screenwriters thought itd be cute I suppose. Eloise is ostensibly a lost soul who keeps making bad choices in life but I dont know to me she looks like a well-toned Jennifer Aniston after a day at the stylist and she seems to have her emotional gear intact. Judy Greer plays Eloises best friend Marty. Dan Fogel is Lane Marshall Burkes best friend (and publicist). They exist mainly to comment on the budding romance between Eloise and Burke who go dates straight out of the rom-com playbook. Lanes signature explanation for how he makes things happen which is supposed to be funny ""Im Lane Goddamn Marshall."" Its sounds like a line Neil Simon would have penned 30 years ago -- and then trashed before letting it see the light of day. ""Love Happens"" offers scene after scene in which Burke counsels attendees at a multi-day seminar in Seattle. They observe the city from a rooftop they walk over hot coals they share their tales of sorrow they even go on a field trip to Home Depot (dont ask). This is movie about how to grieve while engaging in some serious product placement. Ah but what about Burke? Has he practiced what he preaches is he ready to embrace romance with the lovely Eloise -- or is he still in deep denial about his wifes death? What do you think? Enter Martin Sheen as Burkes father-in-law. He is a former Marine and lives in Seattle yet he has the deepest tan and the brightest choppers north of Beverly Hills. Perhaps he founded a tanning salon/teeth whitening office after he retired from the Marines. Anyway he and his wife have custody of the parrot Burke was supposed to set free if anything ever happened to Burkes wife. (Imagine that conversation ""Honey if Im ever in a fatal car accident will you let the parrot go?"") The clumsy slapstick scene in which Burke attempts to recover the parrot is the moment when ""Love Happens"" careens off the tracks for good. The film also resorts to the old ""lone slow clapper who is joined by others in the crowd until everyone is on their feet and applauding"" bit. I thought that hoary routine was put to death years ago in ""Not Another Teen Movie."" Guess not. As for Burkes big breakthrough It happens on the wrong stage at the wrong time in the wrong way and then it gets even worse. Instead of choking up and getting lost in the moment I was just ... dismayed. I dont think ""Love Happens"" has its heart in the wrong place. I believe that everyone involved thought they were making a sincere sweet emotionally moving story. Its just that every move feels manufactured and nearly every performance misses the mark and the tone meanders from maudlin to overly peppy to treacly to sitcomish to just plain sour. Yes love happens. Theres another four-letter word that happens too. (4) Post a Comment  Rahsaid on Saturday July 23 2011 124503 PMI have never seen the movie ""Love Happens"" but I heard it was good.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Bella Im coming. Edward I dont want you to.--The Twilight Saga New Moon Worry not for the purity of your tween girls global mothers. Where Catherine Hardwickes lively irreverent take on the first book in the Twilight series at least made room for a few suggestive winks the sequel is stuck right in the abstinence mud with author Stephenie Meyer. Meyer may be as Oprah admiringly called her recently a ""black-belt reader"" but as a writer shes strictly Dear Diary and Melissa Rosenberg who wrote The Twilight Saga New Moon is nothing if not respectful of her vapid prose. The movie directed by Chris Weitz comes off very much like Clint Eastwoods The Bridges of Madison County--professional filmmaking applied to sub-literary euphemistic trash in this case couched in the jejune crush-fantasies of a Mormon mom stranded at home with three little boys. Personally I dont get the lure of vampire chic but attention must be paid if only because millions of girls on the cusp of adolescence and beyond--not to mention after lights out their mothers--groove to Meyers chaste oddly bloodless and nearly plotless saga of a troubled high school outsider who finds love and protection with a family of expensively attired bloodsuckers in red-gold contact lenses.If nothing else the new movie honors the anodyne spirit of its source--give or take a few CGI face-offs between werewolves and vampires. New moon or not Bella (Kristen Stewart) is still yearning on and on and on and on for the neck bite that will be her ticket to eternal supernatural bliss with Edward (Robert Pattinson) he of the moussed hair fairy-dusted skin and no personality to speak of.All media reports to the contrary Edward has not left the building. After a very long goodbye repeated at 15-minute intervals with mournful stares and fluttery mini-kisses he mysteriously retreats briefly to vampire country then returns in ghostly form to protect Bella from . . . nothing very much unless you count the more than three months unfolding in what feels like real-time that she spends pining away in bed. Some day Kristen Stewart who cut a striking presence earlier this year in Greg Mottolas Adventureland will do great things with her instinctive intensity but as Bella she stares and mutters mutters and stares until discovering risky behavior a la Church of Latter-Day Saints she hitches a 100-yard motorbike ride with a complete stranger then settles for bike assembly with good old reliable schoolmate Jacob (Taylor Lautner) who is not all he seems.A moment of carnal potential rears its head briefly when Lautner pumped unto incredible hulk strips off his shirt eliciting girlish screams from the audience that even the subsequent display of Pattinsons puny white torso cant measure up to. Weitz who seems to have dozed through the making of New Moon thus far wakes up long enough to deliver a short display of bare-fanged competitive masculinity followed by a sudden trip to something resembling Italy with lots of red robes (thank you Dan Brown) and over-the-top Catholicity. There in a movie almost totally devoid of humor let alone real passion waits Michael Sheen king of the evil Volturi decked out in a long black wig and a curling lip. Alone of all the earnest players in this turgidly euphemistic melodrama Sheen seems to grasp that the only way you can keep a straight face through this choked-up virginity is to carry it way into camp.

But thats the good news for everyone else. If pressed to name the weakest link in Stephenie Meyers four-book series fans will usually point to New Moon for the simple reason that the hero -- hot brooding vampire Edward Cullen -- decides to leave his mortal soul mate Bella in order to protect her from himself and his kind. He disappears on page 73 and does not return to full-time smoldering duty until page 451. The heart of the story is about how much Bella misses him -- as does the reader. When the first copies of the book appeared Meyer had to urge some fans to read it twice after she found that they were so anxious (or annoyed) by Edwards absence that they were skipping to the end. The interim consolation provided by Bellas hunky smitten buddy Jacob Black is nowhere near enough to make up for Edwards absence. At least not on the page. (See portraits of the New Moon stars.) On the screen its a different story. The worst thing about New Moon the book is the best thing about New Moon the movie. As Edward Pattinson is all pale passion and tortured restraint; his eyebrows like muskrats determined to mate hunch together in the middle of his sunken face; the few times he smiles it looks as if it hurts and he still seems reluctant to move his mouth when he talks. If you had not read the series in which Edward is infinitely more appealing and dimensional youd wonder what Bella was doing staring off into space in deep mope over this guy for weeks on end. (Read a Qamp;A with Kristen Stewart.) Especially when Jacob Black arrives on the scene to distract her from her melancholy. Where Pattinsons Edward is cold bloodless and trapped in his head Taylor Lautners Jacob is warm tawny genial and able to get Kristen Stewarts shrink-wrapped Bella to stretch out and relax a little onscreen. Its as though the sun can come back out once Edward leaves; there are genuinely funny moments in their scenes together not to mention sexual tension. Expect an eruption in the theater during the scene in which a thrill-seeking Bella wrecks the motorcycle Jacob rebuilt for her and he strips off his T-shirt to tend her bleeding head. From that point on his torso remains so central a character it should be given its own credit line. What the plot of New Moon reveals is that Edward and his vampire family are not the only residents of foggy Forks Wash. to have secrets. Jacob and his Quileute Indian friends as readers will already know have a monstrous side as well; when theres a vampire in the area they transform into werewolves to fight them. And when the wolves appear -- ginormous growling leaping and lunging predator-protectors -- the movie springs to life. The scene in which they chase the vengeful vampire Victoria through the deep woods is vivid and furious a bracing break from the long stretches of teen heartbreak. (""You gave me everything just by breathing"" Edward tells Bella. Oy.) Where Twilight is and remains mainly a love story this chapter of the tale involves far more action vampire-on-vampire violence wolf on wolf wolf on vampire you name it. (See Hollywoods most famous werewolves.) Along the way the supporting characters also seem to be having more fun. Bellas dad Charlie is again played to sweet dry perfection by Billy Burke. The other Cullen vampires get personalities rather than merely orbiting the periphery of Edward and Bellas obsession. Alice is no longer just a cute little pixie; she can scheme and snarl as needed. Even silent Jasper gets to work his magical power to make us feel good. For the first time we meet vampire royalty with Michael Sheen as Aro a kind of vampire Pope and a beautifully creepy Dakota Fanning as his princess of torture. Its in the look of the film that the added time and money committed to New Moon compared with Twilight become most apparent. The scenes are lusher the foliage leafier the makeup mercifully improved so that the vampire characters dont all look coated in calamine. And the settings from the coastal cliffs and old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest (Forks has migrated north to Vancouver) to the sun-drenched Tuscan glories of Volterra (the Italian scenes were filmed in Montepulciano no doubt to the eternal gratitude of its tourism board) give the movie a richer feel even as it maintains its indie sound track and occasionally surreal diversions. Twihards will appreciate director Chris Weitzs faithfulness to the source text even as he improves on it. And Weitz (with the help of Lautners abs) might suddenly find himself responsible for a series of mass conversions from Team Edward to Team Jacob.

Despite the urgings of the teenage girl inside me it was all I could do to sit through two hours and ten minutes without drinking my own blood. What a bloated self-important crashing bore The film is so long it literally leaves the actors straining for credulity. I was willing to stay with the moaning and quivering and heavy breathing for the first hour or so but the story is so repetitive not even a hundred naked male torsos could keep me from yawning. Even poor Kristen Stewart who really is an excellent actress and carries the whole film couldnt be in every scene to keep it alive. Nor is it the first time a girl has discovered that the boys in town are a pack of animals. Even if the special fx on the were-wolves are spectacular there comes a point where red contact lenses and ghoulish makeup cant substitute for the genuine thrills of a plot.Eventually Bella Swann hops in a car and drives swiftly to Italy where she encounters a roomful of expensive actors playing vampires like bored rock stars -- theres Dakota Fanning trying really hard to look evil; and Michael Sheen last seen playing Tony Blair and then David Frost doing all he can to be mesmerising in his allotted five minutes. He almost does it too but hes up against too much sludge.This film has been carefully calculated to exploit the fantasies of teenage girls and such is the ardour of their connection to the Twilight books that theyll probably enrich this dull film with their own febrile imaginations -- unfortunately its a perfect match for a lot of the empty rubbish peddled to this age group. They will grow up to be a powerful demographic I just hope they learn to tell the wheat from the chaff. This is chaff. Facebook Twitter Delicious Reddit Digg what are these?

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 19 2009 632 PM The Twilight Saga New Moon I cant defend this movie but I loved it. By Dana Stevens After youve seen The Twilight Saga New Moon sink your teeth into our Spoiler Special discussion You can also click hereto download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. The Twilight Saga New Moon Sometimes a critics aesthetic judgment is impossible to extricate from what you might call her cinematic libido. There are movies that bring us a pleasure thats neither definable nor defensible. These used to be called ""guilty pleasures"" but that phrase seems too judgmental too pre-Vatican II for our postmodern era of omnivorous cultural consumption. The distinction between high and low culture between what were allowed to enjoy publicly and what we must sneak off to savor in private has effaced itself to the degree that ""guilty pleasures"" needs to be replaced by a more morally neutral term. For our purposes here Ill go with a term that a friend and I coined in college and that I still deploy on occasion movies we couldnt intellectually defend but still unapologetically loved we called ""juicebombs."" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. All that to say thatThe Twilight Saga New Moon (Summit Entertainment) like its 2008 predecessor Twilight is a classic juicebomb. Mopey draggy and absurdly self-important the movie nonetheless twangs at some resonant affective chord. This viewer at least was catapulted back to that moment of adolescence when being mopey draggy and absurdly self-important felt like a passionate act of liberation. The Twilight movies are schlock but theyre elegantly appointed luxuriously enjoyable schlock and the world they take place in--the densely forested perpetually overcast vampire-and-werewolf-ridden town of Forks Wash.--feels like a real if fantastical place. Its as specific and evocative a location as the fictional Washington town of Twin Peaks. Its this sense of place that elevates the Twilight films above the best-selling books by Stephenie Meyer made up of impenetrable blocks of descriptive yet curiously featureless prose. Advertisement When we last left Forks Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) the sulky new girl in town was attending the school dance with her true love the forever-teenage vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Edward a member of an abstinent vampire clan that has forsworn human blood is the dream boyfriend given to slavish declarations of devotion (""Bella you give me enough just by breathing"") yet ever-unattainable because of his insatiable erotic appetite--if he so much as kisses Bella he may not be able to stop himself from ripping her throat out and draining her blood. Like a 50s coed bargaining for her boyfriends fraternity pin Bella is constantly pressuring Ed to make her not his prey but his co-predator. If he bites her in some other unspecified fashion she will be turned into a vampire as well and the two can live together in undead bliss for all eternity. As the second installment begins Edward and his whole pale glittering amber-contact-lensed family are about to leave Forks for good. Ed spouts some nonsense about not loving Bella anymore but we know from his pained face that hes deserting her for her own safety. Bella spends three months numb with grief (a state thats effectively evoked by a long 360-degree shot of her staring out a window as the names of the months flash up on-screen). But on discovering that a rush of adrenaline allows her to sense Edwards presence briefly Bella starts seeking out dangerous situations. Her friend Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) a foxy-fine Quileute Indian whos also as it turns out a newly initiated werewolf helps her to salvage and restore some old motorcycles which Bella takes out for high-speed spins. (The Twilight franchise may promote sexual abstinence but its stance on helmet safety is downright promiscuous.) Meanwhile an ancient enmity between vampires and werewolves is heating up in the forests outside of town. The feminist in me wishes that Bella spent more time actually working on those motorcycles rather than hanging over Jacobs shoulder as he wields his manly er wrench. The feminist in me wishes a lot of things. But say what you will about the Twilight films; they take female desire as seriously as a grad student from the early 90s. The whole overcooked vampire vs. werewolfmythology (which also involves packs of shirtless wolf-boys and a sort of vampire Pope played with camp glee by Michael Sheen) is in essence an excuse to place the viewer in Bellas Timberland boots torn between two flesh-eating monsters feelin like a fool. Haters may construe Bella as a passive victim eager to be served up as vampire meat but shes the subject of this love story not its object; shes the lover while Edward and Jacob are her diametrically opposed beloveds one hot-blooded (Jacob runs a constant body temperature of 108 degrees) the other pale and cold as stone. Matty Robinson a co-host of the excellent movie podcast Filmspotting likes to say of an underrated performance ""I dont want to see his Hamlet but [X] is not bad in this role."" You dont want to see Kristen Stewarts Hamlet--and based on a few lines Ed reads aloud in an English-class scene you really dont want to see Robert Pattinsons Romeo--but both actors are ideally suited to their roles as pining sweethearts separated only by the fact that one lacks an eternal soul. Based on her mumbly visibly uncomfortable appearances on the talk-show circuit Stewart really is a bit of a Bella rough-edged and glum. And Pattinson--well hes best when hes not talking but luckily New Moons Bella-centric plot structure doesnt often require him to. (Of course the knowledge that they may or may not be dating in real life--not since the days of Walter Winchell has a Hollywood romance been more carefully stage-managed--adds to the penumbra of mystery that surrounds the couple.) As a last-ditch defense for my fondness for New Moon Ill observe that unlike its predecessor the sequel (directed not by Catherine Hardwicke this time but by Chris Weitz co-director of About A Boyand American Pie) is often intentionally funny the scene in which Bella insists on taking not one but two prospective suitors to an action movie called Face Punch or the moment when a paper cut at a birthday party leads to a near-mauling by her vampire pals. But a true juicebomb by definition requires no defense. As the screen went black after Edwards supremely cheesy last line my first thought was ""Give me a break.""

"Twilight New Moon | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; twilight-new-moon ) Twilight New Moon (United States 2009) November 19 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Note An argument can be made that this review contains spoilers for New Moon. For those who have read the book there is no spoilage. For those who have watched the trailer there is no spoilage. For those who dont fit into either of those categories the question of whether or not there is spoilage is probably irrelevant. Nevertheless you have been warned. Twilight fans remind me of those who identified themselves with Star Trek in early and mid-1970s Star Wars in the late-1970s and early-1980s and Harry Potter in the first years of this decade individuals who have embraced a fictional universe and are so enamored with it that they are willing to excuse its shortcomings. In a way thats a positive thing because the second entry in the Twilight cycle New Moon is - at least from the perspective of an outsider - not a particularly good movie. Its cheesy poorly focused and features some borderline-awful dialogue and performances. None of that will matter to Twilight fans and just as Star Trek fans forgave Vger and Star Wars fans bravely endured the Ewoks this group will ignore the flaws to concentrate on what works. The thrill of seeing their favorite characters once again on screen will eclipse all else. But the world is not comprised solely of Twilight fans - they are a minority albeit a vocal one. This review is not for them; its for the rest of us. By all accounts New Moon is reasonably faithful to the book although I cant say for certain not having been able to get past page 50 of Twilight due to the awkward and juvenile nature of Stephanie Meyers prose. Director Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass) seems unwilling to cut things that would make for a tighter faster-paced movie for fear or aggravating fans who want every moment from the book to be included. Thus we get a film bogged down by the same lackluster approach that limited the first two Harry Potter pictures - the failure to recognize that the best movie adaptations of books are ones that begin with the recognition that literature and cinema are different media and a rote interpretation of the former into the latter is rarely satisfying to anyone not slavishly devoted to the source material. Twilight was all about the teen romance between Bella (Kristen Stewart) the 18-year old high school student and Edward (Robert Pattinson) the 109-year old ""vampire"" who looks like hes about Bellas age. New Moon picks up where the first movie ended with Bella and Edward playing the girlfriend/boyfriend game until she gets a paper cut in front of Edwards family and all hell breaks loose. Edward rather stupidly decides that the safest course for Bella - despite the fact that there are other vampires seeking to kill her - is for him to vanish from her life so he does that. Bella spends the next 30 minutes of screen time moping around until she is rescued from her distress by Jacob (Taylor Lautner) who has been carrying a torch for her since they first met. But just as he and Bella are getting closer Jacob discovers hes a werewolf. And Bella gets some disturbing news about Edward that forces her to make a choice between trying to resolve her differences with the buff boy who sometimes goes vampire-hunting in a pack or the undead guy with an unwholesome fondness for Romeo amp; Juliet. Yes its all very cheesy with dialogue that even a writer of purple prose might chuckle at but it wouldnt cause nearly as much cringing if the filmmakers injected a little self-aware humor into the proceedings. New Moon comes dangerously close to self-parody on more than one occasion but it seems blissfully unaware of this and soldiers on with a seriousness thats unintentionally funny. The highlight comes late in the proceedings when we are treated to a dream sequence of a future Bella and Edward frolicking in a field. Although this is supposed to be giddy and romantic it is laugh-aloud hilarious. The movies focal point is Bellas romantic choice does she go with the soulful suffering Edward (who always seems to be walking toward the camera in slow motion) or pledge herself to Jacob who is marginally more interesting and charismatic (and who spends 3/4 of the film sans shirt and looking like hes posing for a gay porno video box cover). Based purely on physique Jacob has the edge but I guess theres a segment of fans who prefer Edwards goth look. When it comes to personality and chemistry however theres no question that Jacob is the better choice. I wont go as far as to say Taylor Lautner is a good actor but hes an improvement over Robert Pattinson who attempts to impersonate Bela Lugosi from Plan 9 from Outer Space. Any chemistry that may have existed between Kristen Stewart and Pattinson during Twilight has evaporated. Here she connects with Lautner but her love scenes with Pattinson are sterile and a little creepy (especially when one considers that (a) hes essentially an animated corpse and (b) theres a 90-year age gap - this is an old dude who just happens to be well preserved). Readers of New Moon will know who Bella chooses and thus wont be surprised or disappointed. The same may not be true of those who approach the material fresh. Weitz does what amounts to a bait-and-switch. First rule of movie romances never make the ""complications"" match more engaging than the ""real"" one. I also wonder whether Weitz realized how truly unlikeable Bella has become. Does he intend for viewers to despise her? The storyline is all over the place with numerous unresolved subplots sprouting out of thin air and being left hanging (presumably to be resolved in future movies). The lead male is around for the first 15 minutes and the final 30 but missing for the lengthy middle section. And after the film has reached a natural stopping point it continues for an additional ten minutes with a number of ""fake"" endings that eventually get us to what is supposed to be a cliffhanger. If Twilight set back feminism by 50 years and vampires by twice that New Moon turns its attention to shredding the werewolf mythos. Please dont let Stephanie Meyer near Frankensteins creature At least Bella develops a backbone during the course of New Moon and shows some spunk toward the end. Her prolonged period of lovesickness after Edward leaves her can be attributed to the fact that Meyer writes for 13-year old girls with the sensibility of a 13-year old girl. (Hence the Bella/Edward relationship is all about romance and love and not at all about sex. The film is almost Victorian in the way it treats the interaction between the genders.) There are some small pleasures to be found in New Moon not the least of which is the relationship between Bella and Jacob. Its effectively developed and nicely played and the revelation that Jacob is a werewolf doesnt come across as absurd as it could. We invest a little in these two being together. Stewarts acting - and she deserves some kind of award for keeping a straight face while delivering some of the ripest lines she has probably ever voiced - is in peak form while shes with Lautner. New Moons extended middle act despite being hurt by some really bad B-movie type special effects is by far its strongest portion. But dont get me started on the sheer stupidity of having vampires ""sparkle"" when exposed to sunlight rather than explode into flame. There are some rules that should not be re-written and thats one of them. New Moon offers no surprises regardless of the perspective from which it is being evaluated. Fans will appreciate the way in which the text has been brought to the screen. Detractors and those with no interest will be unimpressed. The film does what it needs to do. Thats the bottom line. Anyone who doesnt experience a tingling or surge of giddiness at the thought of another Twilight movie would be better off seeing something else. Those who mistakenly enter a theater playing New Moon without a previously cultivated love for the characters will either burst something from chortling at inappropriate moments or believe they have discovered a level of Hell that Dante never bothered to write about.

Movie Information The Twilight Saga New MoonRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Chris WeitzActorsKristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Taylor LautnerRun time 121 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (some violence and action)SynopsisDakota Fanning joins the cast in the next chapter in the Twilight franchise.More movies from GuideLive.comWith the sequel The Twilight Saga New Moon director Chris Weitz takes an incredibly awful book and turns it into an instant inductee into the Putrid Movie Hall of Fame. Rosenberg wrote the script this time but she must have been merely taking dictation from Lord the first time around since this screenplay bears little of the sass or humor that made the first one so much fun. (And yes you had to have seen the first one to make any sense of this one.)I know that Twilight is a bona fide phenomenon and Im quite sure Ive just earned nasty entries in the diaries of every teenage girl in North Texas and ladies I feel your pain. I loved the first Twilight movie and had such high hopes for this one. Those hopes were dashed in so many ways.Script devoid of passion humor or wit? Check with the exception of scenes with Kristen Stewart as the languidly depressed Bella Swan and Taylor Lautner as her funny sultry friend Jacob to whom she turns when the vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) leaves her. Edward fears sullying Bellas pure soul; please what kind of vampire worth the title frets about that sort of thing? You sully the entire vampire tradition Mr. Cullen.Inept cinematography? Oh yes. Dark and moody is one thing but this is so murky you have to squint to figure out whats going on. Javier Aguirresarobe also just adores filming the actors prancing about in slow motion looking like fairy nymphs from an amateur production of A Midsummer Nights Dream.Even the makeup is laughable. Stewart looks appropriately wan but the effect is ruined by her impeccable eye shadow and arched brows which stay perfect even through a near-drowning. Edward seems to have had 1970s-era David Bowie as his muse and I just wouldnt want to kiss a guy whose lipstick - is that MACs Underworld? Nice irony - looks better than mine.The one thing that nearly saves this movie is Lautners performance as nascent werewolf Jake. Judging from the squeals from the teenagers (and more than a few mom types as well) in the preview audience Team Jacob has firmly eclipsed Team Edward in the fans hearts.The filmmakers no fools in this regard take every chance to show Lautner and his gang of werewolf homies shirtless. In fact the official werewolf uniform apparently consists of board shorts buffed pecs and the exact same short GQ-ready hairstyle. They look so much like a buffed-up boy band that I half expected them to burst into harmonized song before tearing someones throat out.The werewolf CGI effects deserve praise at least in the action scenes where they appear huge and convincingly fierce. In the close-ups the werewolves look more like big fluffy puppies who need a cuddle.Dakota Fanning makes good use of her limited time as the angelic but vicious Jane one of the elite Volturi vamps whose leader is played with wicked gusto by Michael Sheen. Those two are so terrific that even this script couldnt bring them down but their screen time is sadly limited.Put all the Jacob scenes together leave out the rest and youd have a decent 30-minute movie that Id actually pay to see another time. But sit through the whole thing again? Youd have to strap me down drain me of blood to make me weak - and provide Taylor Lautner to hold my hand. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

(He also reveals himself as one tasty chunk of vealcake.) But Im trusting that between the millions of Twilighters who have already read all four books in Stephenie Meyers blockbuster series and the additional billions who have seen the movie trailer the beast is already out of the bag. The excellent news for fans is that this sequel to 2008s Twilight is a durable recognizably faithful movie adaptation of New Moon. That of course is the second installment in which Bella a dazed confused moody and otherwise identifiable teen-y girl and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) a smoldering inscrutable broody and otherwise identifiable teen-throb vampire swear true and chaste love while trying to keep their hands off each other. Actually Bella is longing to go all the way even though sex = undeath. But Edward abandons her in a supreme act of self-control. Its only then that the devastated Bella drawn to taking all sorts of crazy human risks re-bonds with Jacob during a couple of motorcycle rides without helmets. Meanwhile Edward heads to Italy to visit the high-class Volturi branch of the vampire empire crossing paths with an enticing Dakota Fanning as Jane the pain-inflicter and in a yummy little part The Queens Michael Sheen as Aro a Volturi thought-reader. The production itself directed by Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass) from a script by Melissa Rosenberg is fan-ready and saga-solid. Weitz goes for an appealing slightly old-fashioned look one in which the near-constant rain nicely mirrors Bellas internal weather conditions. (As embodied by Stewart shes one pained and stormy chick.) Pattinson looks to these post-teen eyes even more to-die-for with his red lips amber eyes and major hair. I wish Jacob endowed with Lautners lithe bod and Matt Damonesque grin had more of a chance with Bella. But well book readers know best what happens next in Eclipse.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet New Moon goes through great pains to present itself as a descendent of Romeo And Juliet except without all that icky tragedy in the end. There are warring clans--in this case werewolves and vampires--a rival suitor tragic miscommunication and at the center of it all two self-absorbed teenage lovers. Throw in a revenge subplot and an ancient power-hungry clan of evil Italian vampires and it all sounds potentially thrilling. But in spite of its wealth of conflict New Moon suffers from a dearth of accompanying tension and excitement thanks to the increasingly tedious relationship at its center. After spending the first Twilight movie glowering each other into romantic submission mush-mouthed teenager Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her ostensibly dreamy but actually creepy manipulative vampire beau Edward (Robert Pattinson) begin New Moon as the unhappiest-looking happy couple at their rural Washington high school. But in the fallout of a nasty paper-cut incident Pattinson skips town with the rest of his clan leaving Stewart to explore her range of mopey expressions alone. After discovering that by acting reckless she can induce hallucinations of Pattinson scolding her Stewart sets out to do anything she can think of to provoke those sweet sweet reprimands. Her plan to--gasp--build and ride a motorcycle leads to a developing friendship with local gearhead/latent werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) a cheerful younger boy who promptly falls for her sullen charms providing Stewart with enough anguish to hold her over until Pattinsons inevitable return. New Moon panders to the massive Twilight fan base even more than its predecessor stuffing its overlong running time with go-nowhere subplots and gratuitous shots of the buff oft-shirtless Lautner on top of the protracted silences and longing gazes that have become de rigueur for the series. Admirably director Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass) manages to maintain the series distinctively moody tone while smoothing out the rough edges of Catherine Hardwickes initial installment. Twilights distracting blue-filtered lens and laughably clunky vampire visuals have given way to warmer tones and markedly better action sequences that make the film more inviting visually if nothing else. Lautner helps break up Stewart and Pattinsons overwhelming dourness as do New Moons occasional attempts at humor. However while Lautner is the only one of the three principals who can smile without looking exceedingly uncomfortable his wooden carriage and delivery add up to all the onscreen appeal of a Ken doll and the film still turns in more unintentional forehead-slapping laughs than scripted ones particularly for audiences who havent been inoculated by the books. New Moon was clearly made with its disturbingly loyal fans in mind and while its cheesy melodramatic charm is unlikely to win any new converts to the series it succeeds in giving its intended audience exactly what it wants.

Twilight hunks part of films heartthrob history Greene Lutz winning hearts minds and Maxim >> Check New Moon SHOWTIMES Its too long its poorly acted the storys clunky and the dialogue is laughable. Which says something about the quality of the first film ""Twilight."" ""New Moon"" at least has more of a sense of humor and thanks to a bigger budget and more assured direction by Chris Weitz (Catherine Hardwicke directed the first film) a little more energy. Except when Kristen Stewart is on-screen. Which is most of the time. Which is a problem. Shes back as Bella Swan the lovelorn teenage girl desperately in love with a vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). As ""New Moon"" begins theyre together but shes moping around because she wants him to ""change"" her to turn her into a vampire. Yes its a rather obvious metaphor. Subtlety is not exactly the strong suit of the series and the script by Melissa Rosenberg and based on the novel by Stephenie Meyer is not above beating you over the head to make a point. Like when Bella and Edwards class watch ""Romeo and Juliet"" in English class. Desperate doomed young lovers. Hmm. Remind anybody of anyone? An ill-timed paper cut - yes really - leads to the sudden departure of Edward and his family leaving Bella behind with her understandably confused father Charlie (Billy Burke in a thankless role). If Bella was mopey before now shes practically despondent. She blows off her friends which is a shame for her and worse for us because Anna Kendricks portrayal of the wisecracking Jessica one of her pals is the best thing about the movie. (Ashley Greene as Edwards sister Alice is a close second.) Enter old family friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner) with whom Bella rekindles a friendship. She discovers that when she puts herself in danger she can still see Edward who shows up as a ghostly figure to warn her against whatever trouble shes about to walk into. Jacob is all of a sudden incredibly muscular and strong. He loves Bella of course but his advances suddenly stop. He cuts his hair gets a tattoo and runs around shirtless with a crowd he formerly shunned. What gives? Well hes a werewolf. So theres that. Jacob too must stay away from Bella to protect her; she is evidently doomed to a life of being dumped by supernatural creatures. You hear of the split among fans between Team Jacob and Team Edward. In the movie theres no question. Jacob romps around in the woods with his wolf friends killing the occasional bad vampire while Edward moves away and mopes (at least he and Bella have that in common). Who would you rather hang out with? Bella and Edward cant be kept apart forever of course. Theyre reunited when Edward goes before a sort of vampire council in Italy led by Aro (Michael Sheen). (Dakota Fanning pops up here as well as one of his minions.) Its all sort of silly but impressive in this regard If you can make an actor as brilliant as Sheen seem pedestrian youre doing something. This bit of plot does allow Pattinson to take his shirt off so you can compare and contrast with Lautner if youre still on the fence. Dont worry you have time to decide. The end of the film is a set-up for the next one. Pattinsons actually not in the film that much but he does his swoon-worthy best when hes around. Lautner is more compelling; then again hes given more interesting things to do. But Stewart is a huge disappointment. Granted she is playing a character wallowing in unhappiness. Depressed is one thing. Lifeless is another. Thats ironic in a movie involving the undead maybe. But in ""New Moon"" Stewarts the real vampire here. She sucks the energy right out of the film.

Then good chum Jacob (studmuffin Taylor Lautner) all furry and feral when near Bella reveals himself as Teen Werewolf.This swoony adaptation of the second installment in Stephenie Meyers young-adult series is a potent stew of fairy tale and romance-novel fantasy set in the primeval woods of the American Northwest. Javier Aguirresarobes cinematography is breathtaking and crisp. The swoopy camerawork is synchronized to Bellas hormonal surges and tumbles.This adaptation of the second in the abstinence-makes-the-heart-grow-fondler quartet from Meyer is a gloss on Romeo and Juliet. But screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg and director Chris Weitz give us a story that is equally ""Beauty and the Beast(s)"" and ""Two Shirtless Cute Boys Rescue Damsel in Distress.""In her senior year of high school Bella studies R amp; J in English turns 18 and demands more than a chaste kiss from Edward. He cant live without Bella. Nor can he live with himself if he ""changes"" her - i.e. deflowers her and makes her a vampire.Then he leaves town for Italy to ask the Vampire Vatican to kill him. When her Romeo decamps Bella thinks about ending at all indulges in risky behavior and has a motorcycle accident. When Jacob takes off his T-shirt to dab her bloody forehead his sculpted torso (this aint no six-pack but a 12-pack) gives Bella reason to live.Frankly erotic though appropriate for those 12 and older New Moon (like its source material and also like many romantic movies and literature before 1970) is about the sexual heat generated by chastity. Lets just say its temperature is about 104 degrees.It is also about the two types of boys to whom girls are drawn Brainiac and Jock the madonna/whore of male archetypes.To this end Weitz gives his audience a number of slo-mo shots of the male heroes sequences that straddle the fence between blatantly cheesy and hypnotically mesmerizing. Weitz shows how the objects of our affection move in transfigured time. See Edward walk across the high school parking lot like one running underwater. See Jacob flex pecs and abs like a stop-motion replay of a Miss America strut.Readers of the novels know whom Bella will choose. But New Moon isnt so much about Bellas choice as it is the novelty of a female on screen getting to choose and not waiting to be chosen.Given this swoon-inducer Summit Entertainment would be well-advised to set up fainting couches in the multiplex lobby and provide smelling salts to those who need them.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

This StoryTwilight the love that dare not speak its shameThe Twilight Saga New MoonThe Twilight Saga New Moon A modern Romeo with a bite Discuss New Moon and Twilight maniaDiscuss Robert Pattinson vs. Taylor LautnerHollywood premieres Twilight New MoonView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story You know the kind I mean. Not the flesh-eating ones but the ones who have been counting down the hours and minutes to the release of the film. The slack-jawed legions who will stagger into theaters this weekend clutching their pre-ordered tickets in their outstretched hands regardless of what they hear about the movie. I could say for instance that the movie is little more than your standard love triangle between a handsome if slightly priggish bloodsucker a hot-blooded lycanthrope and the mortal girl who is caught between them. And that would be true if a less than accurate assessment of the films many visceral pleasures. And it would do nothing to dissuade a diehard fan from going to the movie. To readers like the audience members at a recent screening who squealed the names ""Edward"" (the vampire) or ""Jacob"" (the werewolf) when asked to call out their favorite supernatural hunk I say This review is not for you. For everyone else then ""New Moon"" continues the impossible love story between teenager Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) a vampire in the body of a preternaturally pale Ralph Lauren model almost 100 years her senior. Its bad enough that Edward cant decide whether he wants to kill her or kiss her but when his adoptive brother Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) almost eats Bella after she suffers a paper cut at her 18th birthday party Edward decides that the best thing for the woman he loves is to leave her. Enter Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). Yeah I know the character was introduced in the last movie as Bellas shy and slightly awkward childhood best friend. Trust me this isnt the same guy. When Lautner -- who reportedly put on 30 pounds of muscle for the bulked-up role of someone who has just found out hes a teenage werewolf -- takes off his shirt in the movie the audience let out something between a gasp and a scream. It was like nothing I have ever heard in any horror movie. The kids abs are the best special effect in the movie. And thats counting the digital transformation sequences from boy to wolf which are none too shabby and a distinct improvement over the effects in ""Twilight."" Jacob -- whos genial where Edward is moody easy where Edward is tortured -- mends Bellas broken heart or tries to. Haunted by vivid visions of her lost lover especially when shes in jeopardy Bella begins to deliberately put herself in ever more increasing danger as a way to conjure Edward if only in her head. When she dives off a cliff only to be rescued by Jacob Edward mistakenly believes Bella is dead. He resolves to kill himself the only way a vampire can by turning himself in to the Volturi an elite body of European vampires who make vampire rules and execute those who violate them. Which is what Edward plans to do by exposing himself as a vampire to the mortal world. Sound a little like ""Romeo and Juliet"" or its spinoff ""West Side Story""? It should. At times the dueling fashion sensibilities of the werewolf pack (who look like they stepped from the pages of an Abercrombie amp; Fitch catalogue) and Edwards vampire family (who seem to shop at Barneys) are like the Sharks and the Jets only with better stylists. Look theres nothing terribly serious or heavy going on in ""New Moon"" despite a lot of nonsense in the screenplay (written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by Chris Weitz) about souls and damnation. The performances are uniformly strong especially by Stewart who is turning into a fine young actress. Despite melodrama that at times is enough to induce diabetes theres enough wolf whistle in this sexy scary romp to please anyone. And not just the zombies.  1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains violence and supernatural action sequences. 119 minutes. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Twilight the love that dare not speak its shame A modern Romeo with a bite The Twilight Saga New Moon Hollywood premieres Twilight New Moon  Discuss New Moon and Twilight mania Discuss Robert Pattinson vs. Taylor Lautner",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/19/AR2009111901239.html,200,thetwilightsaganewmoon26,thetwilightsaganewmoon,washingtonpost

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Sorry girls The thrill is gone.""The Twilight Saga New Moon the second installment in Hollywoods adaptation of Stephenie Meyers mega-selling vampire romance series is an anemic comedown after the full-blooded swoon of last years ""Twilight. Where the first films director Catherine Hardwicke plugged into Meyers vision of supernatural teenage lust with abandon Chris Weitz is stuck with a sequel thats a morning-after mope-fest.The new movie has two things going for it a relaxed and likable Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black the newly buff Native American kid with a hairy secret and a crush on Bella (Kristen Stewart) and a wicked sense of humor about the storys sexual subtext that doesnt surface often enough.In most other respects the movies a drag - paced like a dirge and cursed with dialogue and a goopy musical score (Alexandre Desplat how could you?) that bring out the books worst daytime soap tendencies. But what can you expect from an installment that keeps the central duo of human Bella and vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) apart for an extended 500-page sulk? Even my impromptu focus group (two adolescent daughters and one friend) voted ""New Moon the least involving of the four books.In the film Edward leaves Bella after a birthday party goes horribly wrong - funny what a little paper cut can do to a room full of vampires. Stewarts an actress of narrow abilities to put it kindly but in ""Twilight she worked beautifully within her limits lighting up with newly discovered love. In ""New Moon shes playing a spurned and devastated woman and Stewart just doesnt have the skill set to do much more than stare woodenly into the middle distance.Just when youre about to give up on her Lautners Jacob appears on the scene helping Bella rebuild a junkyard motorcycle. (Why? So she can drive recklessly and somehow make the spirit of Edward appear to her. Trust me kids this does not work in real life.)The raging hype around ""New Moon has divided the planet between Team Edward and Team Jacob and everyones forced to take sides. On the basis of the movie itself its not much of a contest. When hes onscreen Pattinsons Edward is all emo posturing under a trembling bouffant - the actor suddenly seems to be embarrassed to be here. Lautners performance by contrast has the warmth of an actual human. (And yes when he takes off his shirt to aide the wounded Bella the crowd goes nuts.)All right theres that little matter of Jacob being a werewolf - oops did I spill the beans? This is taking the old Betty-and-Veronica dichotomy to new levels and when ""New Moon breaks out the special effects placing a frazzled Bella between wolfmen to the left of her and bloodsuckers to the right the movie rouses itself to an enjoyable lunacy.Other cast members lift the movies pulse above the standing level. Michael Sheen takes a break from playing historical figures like David Frost and Tony Blair and gets to overact shamelessly as Aro the head of the vampire council known as the Volturi. Better yet theres Dakota Fanning God bless her showing Stewart how its done in one nifty scene as a vampirette with sadistic mental powers and old-school movie presence.Anna Kendrick also walks away with her one scene as Bellas tart high school pal Jessica. (Its a thankless role but no one will remember after the George Clooney drama ""Up in the Air comes out in a few weeks and Kendrick picks up a supporting actress Oscar nomination. You heard it here first.) Too bad the humans get short shrift in ""New Moon taking a back seat to overcooked vampire-fu and supernatural Hatfield-vs-McCoy booshwah.The ""Twilight books are all about sex of course - about wanting it but not having it and about the tension that comes steaming up from the cracks between. About boys who can ravage you but insist on protecting you from the beast within even when you dont want them to. About chastity and its discontents. Hardwicke got that; the first movie was about a shy nobody ennobled by a lust that dared not speak its name.In ""New Moon the stakes are both more obvious and sneakier. Bella wants to be bitten so badly and why shouldnt she when female vampires like Alice Cullen (Ashley Greene) and villainous Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre) are such self-confident hotties? Poor girl - when she gets on an airplane to rescue her lover shes stuck riding Virgin Air. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Longing glances ensue. Twilight"" which was about a girl and a vampire who dont hook up is totally different from ""The Twilight Saga New Moon"" which is about a girl a vampire and a werewolf who dont hook up. And its not at all like the next sequel in which a girl a vampire a werewolf and a mummy fail to find romance nor the one after that in which the girl gets unfriended by all of the above plus the Invisible Man and King Kong -- yet finds her heart aflutter when she befriends the Bride of Frankenstein. PHOTOS BEST/WORST DRESSED AT NYC NEW MOON PREMIERE MADRID PREMIERE | PARIS PREMERE ""New Moon"" is supposed to be an exciting love story plus monster action. So wheres the excitement? Wheres the action? Bella (Kristen Stewart) and vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) stare longingly past each other (Pattinson who keeps entering in hilarious slo-mo is so intent on smoldering at the camera that he seems to forget theres another person around) and swap excruciating love-chat ""You cant (long pause) protect me (longer pause) from everything."" Bad dialogue like bad news doesnt get better with age. This movie moves like the line at the post office. ""Twilight"" -- that culture phenomenon that resembles ""Star Wars"" much as the prime minister of Belgium resembles the president of the United States (respective box office ranks of these two films in their respective decades 71 1) pushes its leads apart with thin contrivances that set up predictable last-minute rescues. This time Edward walks out on Bella for half the film because one of his family members almost jumps her when she cuts her finger. So Edward can best protect her by . . . leaving? Even though he knows she is being stalked by a rival clan of vampires? Not to mention a rival guy buff Jake (Taylor Lautner) who when angry turns into a werewolf. They dont kiss because if he ever got angry in her presence he might maul her. So shes stuck in thwart mode with him too. READ MORE THE VAMPIRE STRIKES BACK Director Chris Weitz proves that ""The Golden Compass"" was no fluke He really is a non-master of action. His CGI werewolves who look like they were designed by the animatronics crew at Disneys Country Bear Jamboree go at it in about three semi-OK bouts. These are by far the best scenes in the movie but they cut off suddenly after a minute or two (you can almost hear the producer yelling ""Thats it for our budget sorry"") as does a vigorous but pointless chase involving Bellas redheaded vampire nemesis Victoria. The supposed climax in which Edward goes to Italy to duel with a trio of Louis XVI-style vampire dandies leads merely to a desultory bit of flinging around. Nor does an attempt to get all goth-y with a mention of hell succeed. The only real shudder-inducing moment comes not from a monster but from Bellas dad ""Youre going to Jacksonville.""

These are hardly superlatives on the order of ""shattering"" and ""beautiful"" but compared to the film versions of ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels amp; Demons"" the only two movies ever made with less sex than the first two ""Twilight""s theyre matchless. The first ""Twilight"" a lower-budget and scruffier affair directed by Catherine Hardwicke may have been lame in the visual magic department but its stars and their smoldering separate-beds bedroom eyes did a valiantly angst-y job in launching a major franchise. The second film in the series is bigger better in the effects and more vibrant visually which is crucial -- the heroine Bella is an Olympic-level mope and if ""New Moon"" matched this characters mood with the visual palette of the first film wed all be dead. Wisely ""New Moon"" brings back screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg who continues to prove she has a much better way with English than the author of the books Stephenie Meyer. The director this time is Chris Weitz who handles this tosh with the commitment it requires. When last we left Bella and her vampire boyfriend Edward theyd come through a serious test or three of their endless love. ""New Moon"" separates the pair fairly early on with Edward nervous about Bellas safety around his kind. With the boy with the fwoopy hair off to sunny Italy to deal with the Volturi (Michael Sheen plays the primo eterno-vampire) Bella pines and pines again and retreats into herself. Then she is pulled out of her funk -- halfway anyway; its a big funk -- by her pal Jacob who is sweet and hunky but who is a werewolf and theres the treaty with the vampires which ... well either you already know all this or you will never ever care. Torn between two hunky supernatural theoretical boyfriends and feeling like an emo fool Bella and ""New Moon"" wrestle with all sorts of metaphoric issues. Vampirism and werewolfery are just two more high school cliques to navigate. Guys with anger management trouble hormonal urges that cannot be satisfied a succession of pristinely objectified boys -- no wonder there are a few female teenage fans. Why does ""New Moon"" basically work even with its grave self-seriousness? A few reasons. Weitz lets the material breathe and his actors interact. The film does not try to eat you alive. Kristen Stewart (above) and Robert Pattinson are interesting to watch even if Pattinsons makeup makes him look like a mime. And theyre strong enough to compensate for the comparatively amateurish Taylor Lautner portraying the perpetually shirtless wolf boy whose subtext remains the same scene to scene Have you seen my abs lately? Composer Alexandre Desplat (one of the best working in movies today) supports the constant abstinence-only yearning with an exceptionally subtle score. In Meyers prose thankfully toned down for the movie every other sentence is ""His golden eyes smoldered"" and ""He continued to kiss my hair my forehead my wrists...but never my lips and that was good."" Stewart and Pattinson get all that across without having to say any of it. Weitz and Rosenberg may let the rhythm slacken in the final half-hour but that is unlikely to matter to any of the people who with this films closing line could be heard squeaking in anticipation of the third ""Twilight"" movie due in 2010.

A Summit Entertainment release. Running time 210. Posted at 112400 AM Comments Well written? Yes. Great literature? Probably not. Intellectually deep and challenging? No. Meant to be? No The fault with these movies lies in the emotional tone deafness of the execs at Summit both directors and especially the screen writer who shouldnt be allowed near a pencil. Its a capital offense when she starts to write. It takes more to write a book or a script than the capacity for form a grammatically correct sentence. So much more that the capacity to form a grammatically correct sentence is not at the top of the list I could say to Meyer that she had the opportunity to explore in some depth a lot of very intriguing issues What is love? Is it merely proximity and hormones? What is life? Is it merely a matter of the amount of time you have? If you stay 17 physically but have been around for 100 years are you still psychologically a 17 yr old? How could he be attracted to Bella? What was the basis of his attraction to her? Of hers to him? What does immortality do to your perspective of time? Nothing? And on and on...but I wouldnt criticize her for not doing this. Its not mandatory. Its left for another writer. There are many books about teen love and teen angst and vampires and none have achieved this kind of popularity so its worth asking why. It seems to me the directors and script writer and Summit execs have not or if they have they are clueless. And many reviewers fail to answer why these books are so popular. Without understanding that you have no context within which to criticize the movies other than to point out lousy directing or acting or script writing. And if you are emotionally tone deaf you have no business being in a creative field even as a reviewer. Posted by Daniel | April 01 2010 at 1057 AM these movie s are the best and you shoeldnt go off telling people what to watch and what not to watch My opinion is new moon and twilight are very good directed and should of gotten more that three stars. I dont like the books because they require reading. So dont go telling people what to watch and what not to watch. Posted by lindsie | December 06 2009 at 0723 PM I really love this show. Edward is my brand of heroin. Posted by marina | December 01 2009 at 0718 AM Wow some of you here are really immature. So what if theyre vampires that glitter in the sunlight? Stephenie obviously was being creative and didnt want to follow the rules. She made Twilight different from all vampire stories. I thought the New Moon movie was pretty good. Much better than Twilight. Im sorry but Twilight SUCKED. Well at least the movie did. The books are very well-written and very descriptive in my opinion as well as others. So I have no idea what some people here are talking about. The movie was directed by the same director who directed The Golden Compass. Which in my opinion was a very good movie. So what if you dont like Twilight? Some of us do. Dont tell us what to like and what to hate. Well do whatever we want. Jessica Age 12 Posted by Jessica | November 21 2009 at 1221 PM Let me tell you this one is better than Twilight. There wont be any film making awards given out for this Chris Weitz directed film but New Moon does give its fans exactly what they are looking for - a visual version of the book that they love so much... Posted by Kate | November 21 2009 at 0914 AM ""Yet miraculously everyone wants to befriend the mopey new girl?"" I remember high school too. And everybody wanted to befriend the pretty girl. Teenagers are shallow. Ive read snippets of Meyers books but not the whole thing nor watched the movie so I have no opinion on the quality of the story but Meyers prose is horrible. If the only thing the movies do is allow fans a venue to enjoy the story without having to suffer through the writing that is a worthwhile accomplishment. Posted by Dave C. | November 21 2009 at 0838 AM This movie was definitely better than the first and I have to agree with SOME of what was said in the reviews but I swear no one wants to cut these guys a break ever. I didnt think Taylor Lautner did that bad a job portraying Jacob I mean he stepped it up from the last movie for sure. The Edward Mime make up...PRICELESS. I absolutely love Rob Pattinson in just about every other movie he has done but Edward Cullen is not the best. I am not so sure that isnt the fault of a combination of Stephenie Meyer and/or Melissa Rosenberg Edward was a major [wimp] in the book as much as I loved them. He was just too much of a baby for me. I dont know how anyone can do a good job of conveying that and make the part believeable and enjoyable for anyone to watch at the same time. He did a good job with what he had to work with. Whether or not Meyer is laughing all the way to the bank whoever said her writing is not all that solid is correct. The premise for the books...brilliant. The writing....sucky. This film was much more vibrant than the last Chris Weitz definitely left us with something to think about at the end and I cant wait to see what David Slade will give us next summer. Posted by Kitty | November 21 2009 at 0115 AM Oh and one more thing. For those who dont care for these movies or books ""to each his own."" Posted by Jenny Germaine | November 21 2009 at 1228 AM I didnt know about the Twilight series until the first movie was on DVD. After watching it I was intrigued and decided to read the books. I was captivated by Meyers imagination the endless hidden messages and literary references in her writing. The series is a modern day expression of themes established in literature such as Wuthering Heights and Romeo and Juliet set in a fantasy world. There are a lot of very positive messages and lessons taught in these books for people of all ages to explore. The movies cant compare to the books but they honor Meyers imagination as much as possible. To me the Twilight series is a little like The Chronicles of Narnia or The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe because if you havent read the books it makes it harder to understand and appreciate the films. Im a sucker no pun intended for a good love story and these characters although the acting was at times a little novice were believable and captured my heart just as they did in the books. Well done. I cant wait for the next two Posted by Jenny Germaine | November 21 2009 at 1226 AM I have to agree with Phillips- Stephanie Meyers writing is not very good. As a high school teacher I can appreciate her for attracting many teenage girls to reading but as a lifelong reader I find her books boring and full of cliches. Posted by Chiteach802 | November 20 2009 at 0609 PM I disagree with your review of the first film- it was terrible plain and simple. But your writing is great and this article was really funny and pretty fair. I agree that Meyer isnt the best writer btw. I like Taylor Lautner though. Hes definitely the best actor of the three main characters even if he is a newb. Posted by Kristen | November 20 2009 at 0303 PM Hmmm....I saw the movie early this morning. I am not a teen. I enjoyed the books and I have enjoyed the movies. I felt New Moon was better than Twilight. The actors are obviously more comfortable with their characters. The effects are better. Everything flows better. Stephenie Meyer admittedly did not write Twilight with publication in mind. It wasnt meant as a great work of literature in the realm of Shakespeare. However any series that captures the attention of as many teens and adults as hers have is worth a lot in my mind. If you dont like the books or the movies you dont have to read or watch. Thats whats great about having a variety of different genre from which to choose. Apparently your opinion doesnt matter if you look at the money New Moon made from Midnight showings alone. Posted by sg | November 20 2009 at 0128 PM Thank you for your honest opinion. So many critics wrote their review before even seeing the movie. The comments on reviews always baffle me. Why put so much effort and hate into badmouthing a book or a movie. If you dont like it just ignore. There are so many important things in the world to be upset about. Upset about a movie unbelievable. Posted by Sara | November 20 2009 at 0123 PM Critics love to hate the Twi-cheesefest. Theyre no high-brow Oscar contender. But theres obviously a huge market for it and the franchise is laughing all the way to the bank Can you say .. Kaching Posted by Mel | November 20 2009 at 1247 PM From the previews this movie looks hilarious. Posted by Jim | November 20 2009 at 1045 AM It looks amazing I love this movie. Posted by leoabetas | November 20 2009 at 0940 AM There are many things that are wrong in your New Moon rating. First of al youre nuts Second the Twilight books are WAY better than the movies. Third your new title is moronic. You were reviewing yhe movie not the title. Lastly if Edward was here in Chicago he would have gone for you already. Zoe Age 11 Posted by Zoe | November 20 2009 at 0936 AM We just discussed your article during our school book club and we would like to ask a question. Have you read all four books by Stephanie Meyer? We think not. For then you would know that the books are well written and MUCH better than the films. Schlock is in the eyes of the beholder and you perhaps need new glasses. Posted by Felicia | November 20 2009 at 0935 AM  Monica Yes but its so tempting to be drawn to a wildly popular pop culture phenomenon when many other people are scratching their heads wondering why in the world this is the case. More importantly I have a deeper compulsion in me thinking these movies could be alot better if handed with better care. Maybe if they threw in a few winks here and there acknowledging some of the cheesier scenes then thatd be okay but there are no winks. These twilight movies take their silly plots so seriously that theres no budging room for us the viewers to roam around with. I hate to bring this up but really its sagas like star wars that offer that level of immersion in my oppinion whatever new thats brought to the table is always different or unexpected. Twilight on the other hand is soooo contrived and linear its just a repeat of selected tropes pulled from teen movies to horror. bek does it scare you even more that I AM apart of your generation? Posted by Josh | November 19 2009 at 1104 PM Even Stephen King who absolutely raved over the writing of Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling has come right out and said that the writer of the Twilight series just isnt that good and I agree with him. Frankly the first book just plain stinks. I tried reading it and gave up about a third of the way through because I just couldnt stand the major characters. I have watched the movie Twilight a grand total of once and that was enough. I have zero interest in wanting to see New Moon and doubt it will even make my ""wait-for-the-DVD"" list. Posted by CGull | November 19 2009 at 0837 PM Of the four books the last one is by far the best. The second one New Moon was hard to get through - I really didnt enjoy it at all and Bellas personality was such a drag. But I really wanted to get to the end to see how it all turned out....call me a masochist if you want. I watched (rented) the first movie and found it to be pretty lame but then again I like TruBlood. I guess theres just not enough violence or sex in it for my baby boomer senses. The books were an easy read and I kind of had fun....some grown-ups like Harry Potter others Twilight. Nothing wrong with reading light non-classics from time to time I wouldnt want a steady diet of this mediocre literature but again some books you can just fly through and this series is all about a quick read Posted by what now? | November 19 2009 at 0416 PM Ill take Eberts opinion on this one...i.e. its just 2 hours of whining emo trash. Posted by mike | November 19 2009 at 0340 PM I love the preview...It makes it look way more awesome than the first movie and now I cant wait to see New Moon Posted by Becky | November 19 2009 at 0206 PM I think the problem is the screenwriting so I have to disagree big time with Michael Phillips on this. Bella is insecure and suffering teen angst in the books but she makes an effort to hide that to the outside world and engage with people to make friends (at least in the first book). So shes much more complicated than written by Melissa Rosenberg and played by Kristen Stewart in the first film Bella is distant and standoffish. The audience is left wondering why anyone wants to be friends with the new girl when she acts like that. I remember high school and by junior year (when the 1st movie takes place) cliques have formed. Its hard to be the new kid in school and if you walk in with Bellas attitude you wont have friends. Yet miraculously everyone wants to befriend the mopey new girl? In the second movie Bella becomes more morose and spends the first half hour literally staring out the window doing nothing. Exactly what does the audience have vested in this mopey girl to actually want to sit through it? Nothing really happens in this movie until the last half hour and the action actually picks up but Michael Phillips thinks this is when the rythym slackens???? I guess Im the complete opposite of Phillips on this. Posted by Catca | November 19 2009 at 0131 PM I find it hysterical that all of you people who so obviously disliked the first movie and clearly dislike the books/storyline in general even opened up this review in the first place and then felt the need to comment on it. Youve got nothing better to do with your time? I for one do not watch slasher movies nor do I see the appeal in them and therefore would never dream of reading the review muchless feel the need to comment on how stupid the premise of the movie was. I am very clear on the fact that while I dont get the appeal of them it doesnt mean that for the people who enjoy those types of movie that Friday the 13th 202 isnt going to be an exciting event. Hello Lets face it - you are either a Twilight Fan or you are not. And if you are not you will never get it. And if you are not a hormonal teenager you are probably in latter group. Move on folks...

Longing glances ensue. Twilight"" which was about a girl and a vampire who dont hook up is totally different from ""The Twilight Saga New Moon"" which is about a girl a vampire and a werewolf who dont hook up. And its not at all like the next sequel in which a girl a vampire a werewolf and a mummy fail to find romance nor the one after that in which the girl gets unfriended by all of the above plus the Invisible Man and King Kong -- yet finds her heart aflutter when she befriends the Bride of Frankenstein. PHOTOS BEST/WORST DRESSED AT NYC NEW MOON PREMIERE MADRID PREMIERE | PARIS PREMERE ""New Moon"" is supposed to be an exciting love story plus monster action. So wheres the excitement? Wheres the action? Bella (Kristen Stewart) and vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) stare longingly past each other (Pattinson who keeps entering in hilarious slo-mo is so intent on smoldering at the camera that he seems to forget theres another person around) and swap excruciating love-chat ""You cant (long pause) protect me (longer pause) from everything."" Bad dialogue like bad news doesnt get better with age. This movie moves like the line at the post office. ""Twilight"" -- that culture phenomenon that resembles ""Star Wars"" much as the prime minister of Belgium resembles the president of the United States (respective box office ranks of these two films in their respective decades 71 1) pushes its leads apart with thin contrivances that set up predictable last-minute rescues. This time Edward walks out on Bella for half the film because one of his family members almost jumps her when she cuts her finger. So Edward can best protect her by . . . leaving? Even though he knows she is being stalked by a rival clan of vampires? Not to mention a rival guy buff Jake (Taylor Lautner) who when angry turns into a werewolf. They dont kiss because if he ever got angry in her presence he might maul her. So shes stuck in thwart mode with him too. READ MORE THE VAMPIRE STRIKES BACK Director Chris Weitz proves that ""The Golden Compass"" was no fluke He really is a non-master of action. His CGI werewolves who look like they were designed by the animatronics crew at Disneys Country Bear Jamboree go at it in about three semi-OK bouts. These are by far the best scenes in the movie but they cut off suddenly after a minute or two (you can almost hear the producer yelling ""Thats it for our budget sorry"") as does a vigorous but pointless chase involving Bellas redheaded vampire nemesis Victoria. The supposed climax in which Edward goes to Italy to duel with a trio of Louis XVI-style vampire dandies leads merely to a desultory bit of flinging around. Nor does an attempt to get all goth-y with a mention of hell succeed. The only real shudder-inducing moment comes not from a monster but from Bellas dad ""Youre going to Jacksonville.""

"Review New Moon is better than Twilight but... - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview New Moon is better than Twilight but...By Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury NewsPosted 11/18/2009 114523 PM PSTUpdated 11/19/2009 104715 AM PST Sexier darker and funnier ""The Twilight Saga New Moon"" rises well above the anemic 2008 film version of Stephenie Meyers first novel with director Chris Weitz (""The Golden Compass"") injecting more humor and visual style than Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"") did in the original. Thats the good news. Now for the bad. ""New Moon"" sags and lags just like the first film suffering from a senselessly overinflated running time some oddball CGI special effects and uneven acting. The hugely anticipated tween flick stumbles the most when the friendship between the vampire-lovin Bella (a strong Kristen Stewart) and wolf-boy Jacob (Taylor Lautner) heats up. Talk To Us Have something special planned for ""New Moons"" release? Email lcaseybayareanewsgroup.com or call Laura Casey at 925-952-2697. Dont worry... shes an Edward fan too With sullen Edward (a brooding Robert Pattinson) literally out of most of the picture - in an attempt to avoid his Bella bloodlust - the romantic burden falls on the insanely broad shoulders of Lautner to perform the pretty boy duties. Lautner looks spectacular shirtless the first time as well as the second and third; undoubtedly his beefed-up assets will make many hearts flutter tween and otherwise. But the strapping lad might have considered spending more time working on his acting muscles rather than perfecting his impeccable six-pack. He and Stewart exhibit a nice chemistry - initially. But when Lautner is required to show a range of emotion once the script reveals his character is actually a wolf in tight clothing the prettiness turns rather dull.Advertisement Lautner simply doesnt have the same acting chops as Pattinson. Weitz and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg (""Twilight"" and TVs dark and witty ""Dexter"") do their best to spice up the material by adding clever references to ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Little Red Riding Hood."" A dream sequence featuring Bella Edward and grandma starts the film and is particularly fun and eerie. But Rosenbergs sly script works best whenever shes lovingly poking fun at the ""Twilight"" story. When Jacob explains to Bella why hes hanging with his buff wolf buddies who frolic shirtless together and engage in a little homoerotic roughhousing he emotes ""Its not a lifestyle choice."" Cute. When Bella hops on a plane to chase after a depressed Edward in Italy she boards Virgin Atlantic. Nice. These touches along with key supporting performances from Michael Sheen (""Frost/Nixon"") as the Don of what amounts to the vampire Mafia and scene-stealer Anna Kendrick (who is generating Oscar buzz for her performance in the upcoming ""Up In the Air"") as Bellas verbose tart-tongued pal Jessica make ""New Moon"" shine bright. Lets just hope the third chapter - ""Eclipse"" - leans on those characters some more while cutting out the flab and smoothing out the rough patches. Only then will ""Twilight"" be a film franchise that has some genuine bite to it.

New Moon A sequel with fangs | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNew Moon A sequel with fangsTheres no sophomore slump in The Twilight Saga New Moon quelling fears that a switch of directors might hurt this unorthodox romance.Star-crossed lovers Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are forced apart in New Moon the sequel to the very successful franchise starter Twilight.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 19 2009Starring Robert Pattinson Kristen Stewart Taylor Lautner Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning. Directed by Chris Weitz. 130 minutes. At major theatres on Friday. PG Its fangs for the memories in The Twilight Saga New Moon as the love between human teen Bella and her vampire beau Edward becomes even more of the mind than the body.Theres no sophomore slump here quelling fan fears that a controversial switch of directors from Catherine Hardwicke to Chris Weitz might bite into the emotional continuity of this unorthodox romance. The stakes are higher and the intensity deeper this time despite a plot that approaches the ripest of melodrama - and which occasionally provokes unintended laughter as does the terribly twee soundtrack.Strong acting across the board and a convincing bond between the two main lovebirds override any objections to the script.Article Continued Below Picking up where franchise starter Twilight ended and sure to earn as least as much box office gold when screenings begin at selected theatres Thursday (the full rollout is Friday) New Moons main drama begins at the 18th birthday party for Bella (Kristen Stewart).A seemingly innocuous accident provokes an unforeseen and potentially fatal response prompting Edward (Robert Pattinson) to move his vampire kin out of the soggy town of Forks Wash.As in movie romances of old serious gentleman Edward has the best of intentions nobly choosing to separate from his undead hearts desire rather than facing the grim possibility of her destruction by forces beyond his control.Just when it seemed that he and Bella might be able to cross the divide between the shadowy vampire realm and the fragile human domain Edward is forced to confront the limitations not only of their risky love but of his own weaknesses.As he grows increasingly confused and depressed Edward decamps from the northwestern U.S. for Europe seeking a violent destiny of his own choosing. The split is the catalyst both for heartbreak and the deepening of desire. An emotionally crushed Bella discovers she is able to connect with Edward on an astral plane whenever her heart rate is peaked by perilous pastimes but another distraction weakens her focus and her resolve.Her native American friend Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) briefly seen in Twilight becomes entangled in both a love triangle and an progressively more volatile supernatural world in which werewolves rise to do battle with the vampires. Lautner obviously prepared for his beefed-up role since he now sports pecs that the Wolfman himself would envy.New Moon is not all love and hisses. Although tangled romance is more the emphasis this time out - Romeo and Juliet allusions are driven home like a stake through the heart - there are action set pieces designed to thrill genre movie lovers. Theyll likely scare the daylights out of everyone else. The CGI creatures arent always first-rate but they get the job done.Edwards trip to Europe brings him to a postcard-perfect Italy and into the dangerous company of an ancient coven of vampires called the Volturi led by a suavely evil royal bloodsucker named Aro (Michael Sheen). When Aro discovers what Edward has been up to with the humans he is not amused. But the scariest figure may be no joke young Dakota Fanning who is no longer a kid. Shes Jane a ruby-eyed Volturi guard who uses illusions of pain as an instrument of torture. With the exception of a new fight scene created for the movie Weitz (The Golden Compass) and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg remain for the most part very faithful to the story by Twilight creator Stephenie Meyer whose best-selling novels started this latest vampire craze.They well serve an evolving and involving love saga that gives us a lot more to chew on than the typical teen romance.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The course of teen love never did run smooth - especially when one lover is undead. Elizabeth Weitzman Updated Friday November 20 2009 948 AM Title The Twilight Saga New Moon When it comes to the vampire world either youre in or youre out. And Chris Weitz who directs the second chapter in Stephenie Meyers adored young adult series knows exactly who matters in this particular club Bella Edward and the girls who love them. So fans will feel fully at home from the opening scenes of ""New Moon"" which establish a pattern that holds all the way through swooning romance PG-13 thrills and enough sharp cheekbones and shirtless boys to carry any adolescent over to the next installment. Weitz takes a looser approach than the series last director Catherine Hardwicke did. He has a better sense of humor too.But he does get tripped up in the long-winded plot which begins with a brief happy moment between high school student Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her undead love Edward (Robert Pattinson). Soon enough an accident turns her into a potential vampire buffet and he gets spooked. Its safest he insists if he and his vamp family are out of her life for good. A heartbroken Bella is consoled by old friend Jacob (an appealing Taylor Lautner). Jake it turns out is hiding his own secrets not to mention some pretty impressive biceps she cant help noticing.Its not long before theyre drawn together and while I dont want to upset anyone here they share a genuine spark thats missing between Stewart and Pattinson. Still we all know where Bellas heart really lies. A cynical adult might note that its easy enough to see where Weitzs heart lies too. His job is to sell as many tickets as possible which means hitting all the right notes. He does that well enough despite some difficulty juggling every subplot. A trip to Italy in which Bella and Edward face a vampire council (led by Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning both underused) feels particularly squeezed in.And while Stewart has deepened her portrayal of Bella Pattinson has little to do but brood.Then again if youve come to this movie looking for fancy filmmaking or an original voice (other than Meyers) well Weitz frankly doesnt care. Youre not his audience.Hes got a franchise to keep running and he does that with workmanlike precision and minimal intrusion. Which most likely is just how fans will want it.

When these oversize hirsute creatures burst onto the screen they inject life into a rather inert story. VIDEO Hanging out after midnight with Twilight fans GALLERY Whos who in the New Moon universe What bogs down this tale of teenage Bella (Kristen Stewart) her vampire beau Edward (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf buddy Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is the morose nature of Bella and Edwards romance. Though an improvement over the first Twilight film this sequel (both based on Stephenie Meyers best-selling books) drags and sputters even in scenes meant to be infused with passion. Pattinson is not given as much to do in this installment since he removes himself from Bella for her own protection. Bella spends an inordinate amount of time pining away. Unless its a Ingmar Bergman film watching an expressionless person stare out a window or trudge around alone in the woods is simply a drag. Even while together early in the film Edward and Bella spend a lot of their time staring intensely and brooding arguing about whether she should ""change"" the apparent euphemism for becoming a vampire. They rarely seem to be enjoying each others company. Being in love with the undead can be a grim undertaking. Edward has a habit of making his entrances in dramatic slow-mo unintentionally eliciting laughter. In contrast when Jacob a member of the local Quileute tribe appears -- often shirtless -- his ultra-fit physique draws squeals from young female audience members. Even gloomy Bella comes out of her funk long enough to comment on his newly buff bod and cropped hair. The scenes with Bella and Jacob are actually playful a welcome relief from the lugubrious ""love hurts"" connection Bella shares with Edward. As played by Lautner Jacob has a spark in the film that wasnt as apparent on the page. Conversely Edward was wittier and more intriguing in the book than as Pattinson plays him. His character is all about the piercing stare and little else. Once Jacob and his pals morph into teenage werewolves the pace picks up. Then it dials down again when Bella Edward and Edwards sister Alice (Ashley Greene) venture to the Italian hilltop town of Volterra. The intended suspense when they are confronted by evil vampire rulers never pans out. Michael Sheen the crimson-eyed Aro plays the character with more high-pitched giddiness than menace. Dakota Fanning has a small role as the innocent-looking Jane who calmly tortures Edward with her mind. Director Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass) has crafted a film with visual flair and polish particularly in the action sequences of werewolves vs. vampires. Fortunately he is more sparing with the tight close-ups and swirling shots that typified Twilight director Catherine Hardwickes dizzying style. But there is a plodding quality to both movies. The lovelorn Bella has little to recommend her as a heroine. Shes sullen self-absorbed and stubborn. That such a bland and passive character elicits the amorous devotion of both Edward and Jacob is rather mystifying. Almost as incomprehensible is the huge appeal of this series beyond the obvious timeworn fascination with vampires and werewolves. New Moon the film version does nothing to add depth to a shallow tale. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Bella loves Edward. No Bella lives Edward -- having made him such a part of herself that she sees him hears him needs him with the sort of every-single-heartbeat intensity that only teenage girls can know. But all her loves in vein. The Twilight Saga New Moon (PG-13) Summit (130 min.) Directed by Chris Weitz. With Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Taylor Lautner. Opens tomorrow at 1201 a.m. in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating TWO STARS Ratings note The film contains violence and mild sensuality Because Edward -- as only a few fervent million readers of the ""Twilight"" series know -- is a vampire and Bella is a mortal. And thats a dangerous gulf for two lovers to try to bridge. ""New Moon"" is the second in their saga and it has the same dramatic problems as the intermediate episodes in a lot of series. The first adventure sets up the thrilling action. The final one concludes it. But the books and films that come in the middle -- they have a far more difficult job. Because first they need to complicate characters and carefully set up situations that will only be fully understood later. Yet second they cant satisfyingly conclude anything of any importance -- and in fact usually end with a cliff-hanger. Its not a challenge filmmaker Chris Weitz really overcomes here. Oh he enjoys the CGI a weakness he already indulged with ""The Golden Compass."" When the werewolves show up theyre the size of Clydesdales and they clomp around till the earth shakes. A trip to Europe brings lots of red-eyed bloodsuckers and red-cowled penitents. But he doesnt seem to identify nearly as strongly and personally with his main characters as director Catherine Hardwicke did in the first film. Nor does this episode have nearly as much going on. Yes theres a deepening of Bellas relationship with the lupine Jacob bracketed by Edwards I-must-have-you/I-cant-have-you Ashley Wilkes act spiced with some Romeo-and-Juliet foreshadowing -- but Bella herself doesnt get to do much until the end. Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner in ""The Twilight Saga New Moon."" And if youve been dragged to this movie by a friend or a date you may find much of the story not only dull but also confusing. Who is Victoria again? And why do werewolves and vampires hate each other anyway? Nor is the writing particularly sharp. The attempts at wit are strictly middle-school level (when Bella discovers the lycanthropes one quips ""I guess the wolfs out of the bag""). And Edwards character seems more controlling (and self-pitying) than ever. Still the three leads approach their parts with conviction. Kristen Stewart is a little twitchy (""Cant she get through one scene without playing with her hair?"" a friend of mine sniped afterward) but her antics and moody moping are perfectly appropriate to the troubled-teen character. As for her co-stars -- well they do exactly what they need to do which is embody two separate kinds of wish-fulfillments for the fans. A newly buff Taylor Lautner is hunky often shirtless -- and very much the Bad Boy (complete with motorcycle and delinquent friends) every girl is warned about. And Robert Pattinson -- all tousled locks and malnourished torso -- has all the troubled anguish of the Sensitive Soul No One Understands. Neither of them seemed particularly appealing to me -- Pattinson acts more like a poser than a poet and the lunky Lautners best feature is his abdomen -- but then theyre not supposed to. Theyre aimed at an audience that bought its tickets weeks ago and arrives tonight ready to swoon. But as vampire stories go -- and theres a glut of them these days -- ""New Moon"" doesnt stand out. Even just in general movie terms its slow and not particularly fulfilling -- a half-an-hour or so of drama stretched out for about two. But for ""Twilight"" true believers though -- well its just their type full of kneeling boys professing their love nasty elders who dont understand and just enough pent-up passion to keep everyone panting for ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" a mere 12 moons from now.

The film is based on the novel ""New Moon"" by Stephenie Meyer. Film opens Nov. 20 2009. Lautner heavily weight-trained and gained approximately 30 pounds to reprise his role as an older Jacob. Photo Credit Summit Entertainment/Kimberley French advertisement | advertise on newsday Filmmaker Chris Weitz said that he knew the ""Twilight"" phenomenon had gone off the rails when the female immigration officer at the Canadian border already knew who he was. And when paparazzi pictures of him and his family eating hot dogs showed up on the Internet. And when he faced the audience at Julys Comic-Con convention in San Diego. ""I dont know if youve ever been confronted by 7000 screaming girls"" he said. ""But its a loud sound."" And Weitz is just the director - which would seem an impolite thing to say if Fridays release of ""The Twilight Saga New Moon"" wasnt poised to eclipse everything in its path. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The second in the series based on Stephenie Meyers YA vampire novels ""New Moon"" will further the cause of making otherworldly superstars out of whom Weitz called his ""big three"" Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner all of whom have already become objects of fans adoration and media scrutiny. Their continued involvement in ""Twilight"" adds a dark note of celebrity overkill to a story already steeped in adolescent passion and impossible romance The virginal Bella Swan (Stewart) is in love with the vampire Edward Cullen (Pattinson). And while he resists her willingness to go over to the dark side he also risks losing her to Jacob Black (Lautner) a member of an American Indian tribe with a few undead skeletons of its own rattling around in the closet. As we rejoin our program . . . the Cullen clan is throwing a party for Bellas 18th birthday but when she accidentally cuts her hand the ensuing flurry of blood lust among the immortal guests convinces the Cullens to leave their Pacific Northwest town for Bellas own good. What ensues is precisely the kind of frustrated teenage love story explored by writers from Shakespeare down to those who carve their initials in trees. Meyer is always going for ultimate pathos but her stories also prove that successful melodrama is usually not about what it pretends to be about The ""Twilight"" series may be set among vampires but its subtext is pure wish-fulfillment and fantasy. MoviesVampires from TV movies ""It puts everyday romantic dilemmas into a supernatural context"" said Weitz. ""And things play out in the ways one might imagine they would play out in everyday life but dont."" advertisement | advertise on newsday Weitz replaced ""Twilight"" Director Catherine Hardwicke. ""Its like Harry Potter "" he said ""Theyll have a new director on each film"" - although that wasnt the plan originally. Virgin territory He said another aspect of the tales that drags female audiences of all ages into ""New Moons"" orbit is its almost chaste attitude toward . . . well you know. ""The way it addresses teen sexuality is very considered and safe"" said Weitz whose ""American Pie"" was anything but. ""The heroine is a virgin and its addressed that shes a virgin and that is something respected by her boyfriend; hes very careful and protective of her. Thats a bit of a throwback in a way. Actually the fact that you mention the virginity of the character at all is a bit shocking."" CelebritiesRobert Pattinson Vampire stories are always eroticized - as Weitz points out the exchange of bodily fluids is a fairly intimate thing even if you may not want to examine it all too clinically. ""You want to take people on an emotional ride not necessarily an intellectual one"" said Melissa Rosenberg who thus far has scripted three ""Twilight"" films (the third ""Twilight Saga Eclipse"" directed by David Slade completed shooting two weeks ago). ""If youre just writing about passion youre doing I dont know what - soft core? There has to be a journey. So its really a coming-of-age story - its about Bella becoming a stronger person. And by the end she has a life as shes created it for herself. The heartbreak is the whole idea of what doesnt kill you makes you stronger. "" Rosenberg said the attraction of Meyers hugely bestselling books is rooted in their point of view something which cant be replicated on screen - nor should it be necessarily. ""The way Stephenie writes is very intimate"" Rosenberg said. ""You are inside that characters head; theres no editing. Youre in her emotions and theyre very raw and real and she keeps it intimate and that draws you into the storytelling in such a compelling way that I think thats what gets people engaged."" Beyond that she said theres a really rich mythology that Meyer grounds in reality. CelebritiesKristen Stewart ""The challenge of doing the screenplay"" said Rosenberg currently splitting her time between ""Twilight"" and the TV serial-killer show ""Dexter"" (""Yeah I like blood"" she said with a laugh) ""is how you maintain that tone when youre not literally inside Bellas head."" advertisement | advertise on newsday A faithful adaptation Still she said the film - not intending to kill the golden goose - has been extremely faithful to the book a point echoed by Weitz. ""When I read the book - which I did in one gulp the way a fan would - I saw how it really deals with melancholy and loss and a lot of deep-dish stuff"" he said. ""I had wanted for quite a while to do a fantasy epic thoughtfully - I thought my last movie Golden Compass had been taken from me and recut and I wasnt happy with how it had ended up."" imageCaption And he said he knew that Summit Entertainment wanted to do right by the book and the fans. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""I think theyll be startled if they expect it to look like the first movie"" he said. ""But I think that what they might be surprised at is that its a very beautiful film."" After New Moon comes Eclipse Its never too early to get hysterical ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" will be released June 30 furthering the advance of Stephenie Meyers vampire chronicle into pop-culture immortality. As the story picks up a string of gruesome murders has Seattle on edge and Edward Cullen suspects a young vampire out of control. Edward and Bella apply to college; Bella wants to see Jacob; Edward proposes to Bella; Jacob licks his wounds. CelebritiesPhotos Taylor Lautner Giving too much away will likely ruin ""New Moon"" for those who havent read it although protecting the plot cant be a big concern given the readership. More critical to Summit Entertainment the films producer is getting the adaptations made while the young stars are still young (rather than face the situation of ""Harry Potter"" which wont end before Daniel Radcliffe is getting mail from AARP). Piggybacking the filming of the four Meyer tales ""Eclipse"" was completed - with director David Slade at the helm - before ""New Moon"" was even released. No doubt ""Breaking Dawn"" the fourth novel and one to which Summit owns the rights will begin shooting before ""Eclipse"" hits the screen although a director has yet to be announced.

"Moonlight madness - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-The Twilight Saga New Moon (movie)MOVIE REVIEW Moonlight madnessSeparating Edward and Bella in New Moon diminishes the passion and our interest.November 19 2009|Kenneth Turan | FILM CRITIC ""This is the last time youll ever see me"" Edward Cullen says to Bella Swan. As if.Spoken early on in ""New Moon"" that promise is one of the least likely to be kept in movie history. With most of that film still to unfold and two more adaptations of Stephenie Meyers ""Twilight"" series in the works the next due out as soon as next summer the world is going to see as much of Kristen Stewarts melancholy Bella and Robert Pattinsons undead Edward as it can take. Maybe more.In the short term however Edward is as good as his word and ""New Moon"" suffers as a result. Constrained by the plot of the novel the film keeps the two lovers apart for quite a spell robbing the project of the crazy-in-love energy that made ""Twilight"" the first entry in the series such a guilty pleasure.""New Moon"" which has been grandly titled ""The Twilight Saga New Moon"" in honor of that first episodes huge success marks the franchises entrance into the self-protective dont rock the boat phase of its existence which is inevitable but a bit of a shame."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;In place of ""Twilight"" director Catherine Hardwicke a filmmaker of intense sometimes overwhelming and out of control emotionality who seemed to feel these teenage characters in her bones ""New Moon"" has gone with the more polished Chris Weitz.A smooth professional whose credits include such adaptations as ""The Golden Compass"" and ""About a Boy"" Weitz makes the vampire trains of Melissa Rosenbergs capable script run on time but he almost seems too rational a director for this kind of project. This lack of animating madness combined with the novels demands give much of ""New Moon"" a marking time quality.Yes I know ""New Moons"" emotional energy is supposed to come through Bellas putative attachment to newly buff best friend Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). But though audiences gasp when Jacob uses his shirt to staunch Bellas blood (dont ask) and reveals a torso that would make Charles Atlas swoon the connection between these two is so self-evidently non-romantic that it turns out not to be much of a diversion.More interesting is Jacobs discovery that as a member of the fierce Quileute tribe he is prone to turning into an exceptionally large wolf at a moments notice a wolf whose main objective in life is to safeguard humans from vampires. In addition to pining for Edward Bella suddenly finds herself in the middle of age-old and bitter enmities. This is one hard-luck young woman.Before all this can happen however Edward has to break up with Bella. Its not like you cant see this coming what with all the bickering these two do about whether she should be changed into a vampire with Bella in the affirmative and Edward worried it seems about her immortal soul preferring she stay in human form.Finally weary of having family gatherings turn into howling crises whenever Bella gets a paper cut Edward tells Bella he and his clan will be leaving town and see her no more. Given everything that passed between them in the previous film this is a wildly unconvincing moment but Bella is devastated and proceeds to spend much of her high school senior year sitting in her room watching the weather change.At a certain point Bella realizes that should she get into trouble Edward will appear to her much like a Bernadette of Lourdes-type glowing vision offering sound advice (what a guy). This turns her into something of an adrenaline junkie courting disaster after disaster just for a glimpse of the one that got away.All this gets to be so troublesome and confusing that Edward decides to make a dramatic and possibly life-changing appearance before the Volturi and their minions the closest thing vampires have to a they-who-must-be-obeyed ruling class. These folks are so powerful they are played by high-profile actors like Michael Sheen and Dakota Fanning. As Jimmy Durante might have said where vampires are concerned everybody wants to get into the act.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--The Twilight Saga New MoonMPAA rating PG-13 for some violence and actionRunning time 2 hours 10 minutesPlaying In general release"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Bella is on a tear in Twilight finaleNovember 15 2012Honeymoon with Twilight director Bill CondonNovember 17 2011Meet the werewoofNovember 18 2009A sneak peak at The Twilight Saga New MoonSeptember 24 2009New Moon on the riseJuly 19 2009"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""250""gt;MORE STORIES ABOUTThe Twilight Saga New Moon (movie)The Twilight Saga New Moon MovieRobert PattinsonThe Twilight Saga New Moon (movie)Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-new-moon19-2009nov19,0,2375513.story",200,thetwilightsaganewmoon39,thetwilightsaganewmoon,latimes

With more bark than bite ""The Twilight Saga New Moon"" finds its brooding heroine torn from her depressive bloodsucking boyfriend and thrust into the claws of a hunky werewolf. Thats sort of like being caught between a rock and a hard place (or in high school terms between a Goth and a jock) and this second screen installment of Stephenie Meyers bestselling ""Twilight"" series focuses somewhat convincingly on the emotions of an 18-year-old coping with her undying love of the undead. Carried by Kristen Stewarts compellingly dark performance but also by helmer Chris Weitzs robust visuals ""Moon"" should cause boffo B.O. tides and could outperform its predecessor which grossed 383 million worldwide. While this second chapter of Summit Entertainments four-part franchise is as good as ""Twilight"" and arguably a shade better its indisputably darker in its depiction of the throes and woes of adolescent love especially when one gets dumped. Thats how things kick off for Bella Swan (Stewart) whose 18th birthday begins with a nightmare and ends with vampire heartthrob Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) telling her hes moving away with no plans of maintaining a long-distance relationship. Bella quickly slips into a massive depression that resembles a full-scale heroin withdrawal while her cop dad (Billy Burke) and barely visible school pals can do little but look on. As foreshadowed in the closing minutes of part one help soon comes in the form of Native American dream boy Jacob Black aka Jake (Taylor Lautner) whos clearly been working out since the first film (as Bella remarks several times). Although they start off as friends its no secret where things are headed and Bella engages in several near-suicidal acts that leave her torn between Edwards far-reaching grasp and Jakes bulging biceps. Bella and Jakes growing relationship is paralleled by rumors of random animal attacks in the woods as well as the increasingly menacing presence of Jakes macho buddies (all of whom like Jake prefer to remain bare-chested especially after it starts raining). When vampires from the first go-round resurface to take revenge on Bella a pack of colossal werewolves comes to her rescue and it doesnt take a degree in occult studies to make the connection between the beasts and the boys. Pics first half maintains a somber atmosphere that is broken by spells of PG-13 violence (a decapitation a few gory closeups) and some nifty cinematic tricks including a twirling 360-degree shot that shows the passing of time as Bella recovers from the break-up. Director Weitz (""The Golden Compass"") taking the reins from ""Twilight"" helmer Catherine Hardwicke and lenser Javier Aguirresarobe painstakingly depict the gloomy dreamlike state of Bellas extended blues and then pick up the pace about an hour in with several action sequences set in the rain-soaked woods near Forks Wash. As expected Edward soon reappears albeit for confused reasons and the quid pro quo eventually carries the action to a royal Italian vampire council (known as the Volturi) providing some handsome locations and a brief turn by Dakota Fanning as a mind-controlling heavily made-up vampiress. The shortcuts needed to propel the narrative homeward feel a tad rushed but screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg (who also penned ""Twilight"") wisely keeps things focused on Bellas ever-changing mostly darkening emotional states and whether she will end up choosing Edward or Jake. Stewart is the heart and soul of the film and not only because her Bella is surrounded by characters who literally have neither one nor the other. She gives both weight and depth to dialogue (""Youre just warm. Youre like your own sun"") that would sound like typical chick-lit blather in the mouth of a less engaging actress and she makes Bellas psychological wounds seem like the real deal. Fangirls may be disappointed by Pattinsons reduced presence here as his Edward appears predominantly in mumbling visions until a cliffhanger that brazenly sets up the next episode. Lautners Jake provides a strong alternative to Edwards pale dreariness though the filmmakers overdo the ""strong"" part in an ongoing effort to keep their target audience enraptured. Tech credits and visual effects have improved since ""Twilight.""
