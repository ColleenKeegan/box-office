With Harrison Ford Kate Capshaw. Directed by Steven Spielberg. Running time 1 hour 38 minutes. Rated PG.This review originally ran in the May 23 1984 edition of the New York Daily News.""Nothing shocks me"" says the rugged man-about-the-Far East who has survived a lot of shocking situations. Im a scientist."" The truth is the well-known archeologist seems to dig up trouble wherever he goes. In Madagascar they were so displeased with his work that there was some talk of cutting off his...Well why go on? You should recognize this cool character by now for he is none other than Indiana Jones that reckless seeker of fortune who first endeared himself to audiences in Steven Spielbergs wonderfully giddy adventure movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""Indie you will be happy to learn hasnt changed a bit. Played with gruff determination by the appealingly rugged Harrison Ford he continues to set quite a pace for himself in Spielbergs rip-roaring boldly imaginative sequel to his blockbuster hit.In ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" he still insists upon showing up in all the wrong places. Like a Shanghai night club for instance where a welcoming committee consisting of a very nasty-looking Chinese mobster and his trigger-happy associates welshes on a deal. The elegant club is soon in shambles. And the clubs entertainer a dippy blond singer (Kate Capshaw) who has just performed her own punchy interpretation of ""Anything Goes"" in Chinese is not at all pleased to find herself sailing through a window in the company of Indie.After plummeting several stories they land in the back of a cab driven by a Chinese whiz kid (Ke Huy Quan) who could easily compete in the Indianapolis 500. They make a dash for the airport where a cargo plane is all too conveniently waiting for them. Somewhere over the Himalayas the cackling pilot and co-pilot bail out.Indie is once again called upon to use all his hidden resources namely his intelligence and courage. He grabs an inflatable raft and along with Willie Scott the lady from Shanghai and Short Round his pint-sized chauffeur he attempts to float to safety in a rubber boat which in the movies funniest action sequence costs down an icy slope like a bobsled only to eventually wind up where it belongs in a raging river.Willie tends to over-react to this unnerving series of events. She screeches in horror every time she is confronted with such beasts of the jungle as a chimp and an owl. As Indie rightfully complains"" The big trouble with her is the noise.""A visit to a poverty-stricken Indian village where the starving inhabitants are complaining about the recent disappearance of their children and the theft of ""the sacred Sankara stone"" brings out the Boy Scout impulse in Indie. Or is it simply his greed? For Indie fully realizes that finding the Sankara stone could mean ""fortune and glory"" for him. At the very least he could probably afford to replace his beat-up leather jacket. Whatever the reason he decides to visit the Palace of Pankot where the maharajah is said to be keeping the sacred stone. ""I cant go to Pankot"" frets Willie. ""Im a singer.""But Willie gets to play the Palace. After attending a lavish welcoming banquet featuring such delicacies as live snakes the threesome stumble across the Temple of Doom the home base of a devil-worshiping cult whose high priest Mola Ram is fully capable of ripping out the heart of his sacrificial victims before roasting them in a fiery pit.The movie becomes a little too grim and overly realistic at this point. This latest crackerjack imitation of the old-fashioned Hollywood serials runs out of steam for a short period if only because Spielberg seems momentarily to lose his light touch. Fortunately the movie picks up speed during a wild and crazy chase sequence involving mining carts. The final cliffhanging sequence in which the main characters dangle over a cliff thousands of feet above a crocodile-infested river is a terrific wind-up for a sequel that actually lives up to all the expectations. Capshaw is extremely funny as the hysterical Willie although Ford and his previous leading lady his ""Raiders co-star Karen Allen seemed to be more chemically suited to each other. Quan is adorably sassy and energetic as Short Round. All in all Spielberg has come up with another rousing piece of entertainment.

"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; indiana-jones-and-the-temple-of-doom ) Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (United States 1984) A movie review by James Berardinelli The explosive (and not entirely unexpected) success of Raiders of the Lost Ark ensured that the movie-going public would meet Indiana Jones again. And indeed as soon as Harrison Ford removed the mantle of Han Solo for the final time he once again donned the fedora. Its understandable that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg had difficulty re-creating the fun and nonstop action of the first Indy movie. Even though Raiders was descended from a long line of movie house serials the 1981 movie had represented an introduction to a new generation; to them it was fresh and new. The Temple of Doom did not have that benefit. It had to stand or fall on its own merits and it did a little of both. There are two things I remember about The Temple of Doom during its original theatrical run. Everyone had to see it - it was the must-see theatrical event of the summer - and it was hard to find someone who wasnt disappointed. It wasnt just that the breezy sense of freshness was gone; it had been replaced not merely by something darker but by something a little mean-spirited. The famous ""heart removal"" scene became the impetus for the creation of the PG-13 rating. In trying to take their character and his adventures in a direction that would not copy Raiders Lucas and Spielberg leeched a lot of the fun out of Indy. Torture. Child abuse. Hearts ripped out. Black magic. It was all a little too much. And the inclusion of ill-placed sequences of physical comedy didnt lighten the tone so much as make the movie occasionally feel schizophrenic. The idea to make The Temple of Doom a prequel was also a mistake. One of the assets of Raiders was the way in which the characters interacted especially Indy and Marion (Karen Allen) and Indy and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies). These relationships formed the backbone of Raiders. Yes audiences flocked to theaters to see the action but it was their fondness for the characters that enriched the experience. The chemistry between Ford and Allen crackled; these characters were made for each other. So what happened with The Temple of Doom? Gone are Marion and Sallah. In their places Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) and Short Round (Ke Huy Quan). With all apologies to Ms. Capshaw who obviously appealed strongly to the director shes no Karen Allen. Any chemistry between her and Ford is accidental and incidental. As a love interest shes a bust. Her role is therefore to scream a lot get into trouble from which she needs to be rescued and annoy the hell out of viewers who are tired of this sort of comedic damsel in distress act. It might be acceptable if it was more amusing and less tedious. The cliffhanger-tinged action that made the first movie so appealing has been toned down. Theres an extended sequence at the opening and another one at the end but excepting a scene involving bugs and spikes theres not much in the middle. Thats not to say that The Temple of Doom is boring but it lacks the momentum that drove the first movie from its opening scene to its closing moment. In terms of all-time Indiana Jones stunts Id stack the plane escape (near the beginning) and the mine car chase (near the end) against anything else Lucas and Spielberg have put on film. Its too bad there werent more moments like this. Raiders has so many its difficult to single them out. The Temple of Doom is more selective and not the better for it. The Temple of Doom opens in 1935 Hong Kong with archeologist adventurer Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in trouble with a local crime lord. As is his style Indy has to make a daredevils escape - this time in the company of his pint-sized sidekick Short Round and a nightclub singer Willie Scott. Eventually after a series of improbable close calls this trio ends up in India where they are implored by the leaders of a small village to retrieve a stolen magic stone. More because he senses a chance for fame and fortune than because he cares about the villagers Indy agrees. This results in a journey that takes him into a majestic palace with a dark secret. Members of the rulership are involved in the Thugee cult and their plans are to use dark magic to accomplish world domination. Dr. Jones ends up being the ""fly in the ointment"" (to quote another 80s action movie). Parents and their offspring alike were startled by what Spielberg revealed in the depths of the title location. Children shackled and force to work under threat of being whipped. Indiana drugged and homicidal. Brutal physical punishment - far more graphic than in the first feature. The setting is one of fire and brimstone reminiscent of one of Dantes levels of hell. Lucas has been quoted as saying that as he had made The Empire Strikes Back darker than Star Wars so he wanted to make The Temple of Doom darker than Raiders. He achieved the goal but few would argue that The Temple of Doom is anywhere close to being as successful as Empire. There is something to be said of the grimmer tone and the fact that The Temple of Doom doesnt feel like a retread of Raiders. In fact the film holds up better than the lighter Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade which often feels like a re-make of Raiders with Sean Connery thrown in for comic relief. As I mentioned earlier its not the darker turn that makes The Temple of Doom uncomfortable at times; its its mean-spiritedness. Some of the scenes of torture go too far especially for PG movie. We come to an Indiana Jones movie to have fun; some of what goes on here is anything but that. Its tough to say which is more out-of-place the awful slapstick act of Willie as she avoids animals while camping outside or the scene in which the villainous Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) plunges his hand into a victims chest and rips out his heart then holds it up so everyone can see it beating. The moment has become as iconic as the chestburster scene in Alien but perhaps not for the right reasons. It sent countless parents storming from theaters with their horrified children in tow. Ultimately though this is only one of several problems to plague The Temple of Doom. It could easily have survived the darkness had the rest of the film been on firm ground. But Indys companions are weak; we dont identify with them the way we did with Marion and Sallah. Theres less action and more overt comedy and neither change works to the benefit of the story. Raiders managed the perfect blend of both; The Temple of Doom loses the recipe. Still when all is said and done this remains an Indiana Jones adventure and Harrison Ford is as perfect in the role the second time as he was the first. Hes the ideal mix of heroism and self-interest; machismo and practicality; roughness and culture. He can be James Bond or Han Solo or Sam Spade. Whatever else The Temple of Doom may lack its got Indy and thats more than a little benefit. By my reckoning Raiders of the Lost Ark is a nearly perfect film. There was no way The Temple of Doom could have equaled it. Yet the movie doesnt fall just a little short - it falls considerably short. Even all these years later a pall hangs over it - a whiff not necessarily of failure but of expectations missed. Sadly while things would lighten up for installment 3 the change in tone didnt equate to an upswing in quality.

This is ironic because director Steven Spielberg has packed even more thrills and chills into this followup than he did into the earlier pic but to exhausting and numbing effect. Just as ""Return of the Jedi"" seemed disappointing after the first two ""Star Wars"" entries so does ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" come as a letdown after ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" This is ironic because director Steven Spielberg has packed even more thrills and chills into this followup than he did into the earlier pic but to exhausting and numbing effect. End result is like the proverbial Chinese meal where heaps of food can still leave one hungry shortly thereafter. Will any of this make any difference at the boxoffice? Not a chance as a sequel to ""Raiders"" which racked up 112000000 in domestic film rentals has more built-in want-see than any imaginable film aside from ""E.T. II."" Spielberg scenarists Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz and George Lucas who penned the story as well as exec producing with Frank Marshall have not tampered with the formula which made ""Raiders"" so popular. To the contrary they have noticeably stepped up the pace amount of incidents noise level budget close calls violence and everything else to the point where more is decidedly less. Prequel finds dapper Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones in a Shanghai nightclub in 1935 and title sequence which features Kate Capshaw chirping Cole Porters ""Anything Goes"" looks like something out of Spielbergs ""1941."" Ford escapes from an enormous melee with the chanteuse in tow and joined by Oriental moppet Ke Huy Quan they head by plane to the mountains of Asia where they are forced to jump out in an inflatable raft skid down huge slopes vault over a cliff and navigate some rapids before coming to rest in an impoverished Indian village. Communitys leader implores the ace archaeologist to retrieve a sacred magical stone which has been stolen by malevolent neighbors so the trio makes its way by elephant to the domain of a prepubescent Maharajah who lords it over an empire reeking of evil. Remainder of the yarn is set in this labyrinth of horrors where untold dangers await the heroes. Much of the action unfolds in a stupendous cavern where dozens of natives chant wildly as a sacrificial victim has his heart removed before being lowered into a pit of fire. Ford is temporarily converted to the nefarious cause Ke Huy Quan is sent to join child slaves in an underground quarry and Capshaw is lowered time and again into the pit until the day is saved. What with John Williams incessant score and the library full of sound effects there isnt a quiet moment in the entire picture and the filmmakers have piled one giant setpiece on top of another to the point where one never knows where it will all end. Films one genuinely amazing action sequence not unlike the airborne sleigh chase in ""Jedi"" (the best scene in that film) has the three leads in a chase on board an underground railway car on tracks resembling those of a rollercoaster. Sequence represents a stunning display of design lensing and editing and will have viewers gaping. A ""Raidersland"" amusement park could be opened profitably on the basis of the ride alone. Overall however pic comes on like a sledgehammer and theres even a taste of vulgarity and senseless excess not apparent in ""Raiders."" Kids 10-12 upwards will eat it all up of course but many of the images particularly those involving a gruesome feast of live snakes fried beetles eyeball soup and monkey brains and those in the sacrificial ceremony might prove extraordinarily frightening to younger children who indeed are being catered to in this film by the presence of the adorable 12-year-old Ke Huy Quan. Compared to the open-air breeziness of ""Raiders"" ""Indiana Jones"" after the first reel or so possesses a heavily studio-bound look with garish reds often illuminating the dark backgrounds. As could be expected however huge production crew at Thorn EMI-Elstree Studios as well as those on locations in Sri Lanka Macao and California and in visual effects phase at Industrial Light amp; Magic have done a tremendous job in rendering this land of high adventure and fantasy. Ford seems effortlessly to have picked up where he left off when Indiana Jones was last heard from (though tale is set in an earlier period) although Capshaw who looks fetching in native attire has unfortunately been asked to react hysterically to everything that happens to her resulting in a manic frenzied performance which never locates a center of gravity. Villains are all larger-than-life nasties. Critical opinion is undoubtedly irrelevant for such a surefire commercial attraction as ""Indiana Jones"" except that Spielberg is such a talented director its a shame to see him lose all sense of subtlety and nuance. In one quick step the ""Raiders"" films have gone the way the James Bond opuses went at certain points away from nifty stories in favor of one big effect after another. But that wont prevent Spielberg and Lucas from notching another mark high on the list of all-time b.o. winners. Cart. 1984 Best Visual Effects.

It might consist of sheeps eyes in runny aspic live cockroaches wrapped in spider webs juicy worms a la king and bats brains with anchovies and chocolate sauce. The children squeal with delighted horror as each new dish is described finding it all delicious fun though any adults in the vicinity will probably feel sick. This may well be the publics reaction to Steven Spielbergs exuberantly tasteless and entertaining Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom which opens today at Loews Astor Plaza and other theaters and which already is causing a ruckus because of its PG rating. The film is called a pre-sequel to Mr. Spielbergs enormously popular Raiders of the Lost Ark since its about the pre-Raiders exploits of that earnest usually unshaved remarkably quick-witted archeologist- adventurer with the battered fedora Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford). The time is 1935 and the place is a Shanghai nightclub. Behind the opening credits we watch a comically klutzy Busby Berkeley-like production number featuring an American entertainer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw) backed by a line of Asian chorus girls tap-dancing their gold hearts out and singing - sometimes with Chinese lyrics - Cole Porters Anything Goes. Its an unfortunate measure of how the film works that this opening sequence is the best funniest most efficient one in the movie. It not only introduces Indiana Jones and Willie who loathe each other on first sight (the better to fall in love later) but it also ends with a great barroom brawl in which a priceless diamond gets lost in a shower of similarly shaped ice cubes. After that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom doesnt exactly go downhill it just runs along on a plain but at such breakneck speed one doesnt have time to question things too closely. Theres a wild chase through Shanghais cluttered streets with Indianas getaway car being driven by his pint-sized 12-year-old chauffeur- sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) followed by a flight westward in a fine old Ford Tri-Motor from which Indiana Willie and Short Round must bail out without benefit of parachutes. Most of the film takes place in a remote Himalayan province and involves (1) a village from which all the children have mysteriously vanished (2) a sacred rock with magical powers and (3) a cult of Kali worshipers (remember Lives of a Bengal Lancer?) whose practices include human sacrifice. The screenplay written by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz (American Graffiti) from a story by George Lucas is serviceable but no match for the witty one by Lawrence Kasdan for Raiders. Unlike Raiders the new movies script never quite transcends the schlocky B-movie manners that inspired it. Though it looks as if it had cost a fortune Indiana Jones doesnt go anywhere possibly because its composed entirely of a succession of climaxes. It could end at any point with nothing essential being lost. Watching it is like spending a day at an amusement park which is probably what Mr. Spielberg and his associates intended. It moves tirelessly from one ride or attraction to the next only occasionally taking a minute out for a hot dog and then going right on to the next unspeakable experience. These include a quite fine movie equivalent to a roller-coaster ride a walk through a pit full of scorpions and cockroaches as well as a maharajahs banquet where the menu features the kind of dishes (live baby snakes chilled monkey brains) that children will find simultaneously revolting and hilarious while the rest of us reach for our Tums. Theres no doubt about it - the movie in addition to being endearingly disgusting is violent in ways that may scare the wits out of some small patrons. The kidnapped Indian children when finally found are seen being flogged as they slave away deep in the maharajahs mines though the flogging is so exaggerated that it seems less real than cartoon- like. Theres a vivid sequence in which a man being offered to Kali is slowly lowered into a fiery pit but not before a priest has removed the victims heart with his bare fingers. This however is not only a film-making trick but a trick within the film itself something that older children may understand more readily than their adult guardians. Nevertheless its something to give parents pause. Mr. Ford has become very good at this sort of characterization in this sort of film. He gives an exceptionally skillful comic performance demonstrating the kind of easy charm and timing that eluded Michael Douglas in his somewhat similar role in Romancing the Stone. Miss Capshaw is most attractive and surprisingly good-natured even though most of the time she isnt expected to do much more than squeal. At one point this prompts Indiana to say to Short Round The biggest trouble with her is the noise as he chooses to ignore the python that has slithered up to her. Ke Huy Quan whose first film this is is a very good comic sidekick who in moments of stress which come often sounds a little like Donald Duck. Indiana Jones is too shapeless to be the fun that Raiders is but shape may be beside the point. Old- time 15-part movie serials didnt have shape. The just went on and on and on which is what Indiana Jones does with humor and technical invention. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom which has been rated PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) contains a lot of explicit violence of the sort described above.
