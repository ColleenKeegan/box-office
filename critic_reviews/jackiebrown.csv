More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Facing the daunting task of making a third feature that could measure up to ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" not to mention one that would disarm the detractors ready to pounce on him no matter what Quentin Tarantino treads turf that is both familiar and fresh in ""Jackie Brown."" Unquestionably too long and lacking the snap and audaciousness of the pictures that made him the talk of the town this narratively faithful but conceptually imaginative adaptation of Elmore Leonards novel ""Rum Punch"" nonetheless offers an abundance of pleasures especially in the realm of characterization and atmosphere. Down-and-dirty pic looks to find its most ardent fans among cinephiles and black viewers with mainstream critics and audiences more likely to harp on its obvious indulgences. B.O. prospects are OK in urban areas less so elsewhere. Enshrined as Hollywoods golden bad boy after ""Pulp Fiction"" Tarantino was clearly in a position to do anything he wanted as his next film and took more than three years to do it. Superficially sticking to his roots in violent crime stories and paying homage to 70s blaxploitation pics through his offbeat casting of Pam Grier in the title role writer-director also uses the occasion to promisingly expand his range in more emotional and nuanced directions. This development may be lost on genre fans expecting heavy mayhem and gunplay of which there is some but it augurs well for Tarantino one day venturing into other types of stories. As it is ""Jackie Brown"" is an arguably too fulsome examination of deceit treachery cunning stupidity mistrust risk and daring among a group of small-timers. Transferring the action from Leonards Miami to his own South Bay area of L.A. and changing the leading character from white to black Tarantino has adhered closely to the plot of the celebrated authors 1995 bestseller but has given it a distinctive tang through his patented touch with contempo street dialogue and highly personal use of source music and pop culture artifacts. Film takes its own sweet time setting its gears in motion with the emphasis on sweet when it comes to amusingly establishing its characters but to the detriment of pace. Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) is a very smooth and lethal arms dealer operating out of a Hermosa Beach pad he shares with blond and always stoned surfer girl Melanie (Bridget Fonda). Hanging out with his longtime partner Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) who has just been released from the slammer after serving four years for bank robbery Ordell critiques the various assault weapons he can deliver while announcing that he intends to get out of the illicit gun business after stashing away another 500 grand down in Mexico. However Ordell whose nearly every phrase contains the n-word must first deal with an errant associate Beaumont (Chris Tucker) a fast-talking hustler who has violated his parole. In a sequence that typifies Tarantinos taste for combining outrageous comedy with startling violence Ordell sweet-talks his manic friend into climbing into his car trunk in order to surprise an adversary then in a boldly pro-tracted long shot casually shoots him when they arrive at a vacant lot. More trouble lands on Ordells doorstep when stewardess Jackie Brown (Grier) is busted at LAX by ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and cop Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) while smuggling 50000 into the country for him. Facing a prison term and meager future prospects upon her release the sharp-looking lady in her mid-40s knows shell get off easy if she helps the authorities nail Ordell who bails Jackie out but is thwarted in his attempt to do to her what he did to Beaumont. In a story featuring several relationships in which trust and mutual suspicion perform a continual balancing act the most significant is the one carrying the least narrative weight. Bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) a resolutely solid middle-class and middle-aged man whom Ordell uses to spring his friends picks Jackie up at jail and offers her a ride home. His function in the plot would end there except that in a moment con-veyed with great wit through the music he falls hard for Jackie the moment he sees her takes her for a relaxing drink and eventually sets this woman with few options on a path that will see her bravely playing the authorities and Ordell against each other. The quasi-romance between these two unlikely partners both of whom are at midlife cross-roads provides a quiet emotional undercurrent beneath the yarns otherwise more extreme erup-tions. Laying low for awhile Louis takes the flaky Melanie up on her invitation to have sex then berates Ordell for trusting her. Admitting to Ordell how shes had to cooperate with the cops Jackie convinces him that shes going to put one over on them by staging an intricate money exchange in which shell actually return to Ordell nearly all of his 500000. In a mild but nonetheless highly effective echo of his ""Pulp Fiction"" structural experimentation Tarantino in a 20-minute setpiece stages this ex-change three times from different points of view each one revealing key aspects of the daredevil maneuver. As the main participants urgently pursue their interests in the bloody aftermath half of the major characters bite the dust leading to a mutedly upbeat finale. The action indisputably flags during the long midsection but the films longueurs are inseparable from its strengths in that they stem from the same fact Tarantino works his scenes for all they are worth extracting from them the maximum values of drama humor color and character. For him there are no small or insignificant sequences nothing to be thrown away. The results of this approach are scenes that individually play wonderfully well but when laid end to end tend to flatten out. Pic suffers not only from overlength but from a lack of dramatic peaks and valleys of punctuation something that was alleviated in the equally long ""Pulp Fiction"" by the audacious dovetailing structure and more outrageous incidents. Ultimately despite the flavorsome aspects of all the elements it can be argued that a genre piece of this kind has trouble supporting such extended treatment even when the characters and situations are deepened as far as Tarantino takes them. In this light the directors courage in scouting the outer reaches of this sort of material can be regarded very sympathetically even if the approach ultimately reveals the forms limitations. Tarantinos knack for imaginative casting and extracting unusual unexpected notes from actors is in full flower here. A true icon of the 70s Grier who has aged beautifully may not have the widest range but her tremendous poise visible at once in the opening shots of her arriving at LAX serves her exceedingly well and she does have two or three big moments to sink her teeth into. Jackson sporting a flowing hairdo and stringed chin hair is superb as the charming loquacious ultimately malevolent gunrunner who uses people as pawns for his own ends. Forster another thesp Tarantino has resurrected lends a wonderfully lived-in quality to the bail bondsman whos seen it all and has a special appreciation for what Jackie is going through. Fonda brings an irreverent spunkiness to her amoral beach girl and Keaton manages to inject some honest emotion into his efficient federal agent. De Niro plays a seedy relatively uninteresting sideline character for most of the way only to erupt in the late going in ways that are both insanely violent and touchingly honest and loyal. Enormously entertaining soundtrack is loaded with soul and funk hits some from vintage blaxploitation hits. Technically film is evocative of mostly dingy locales where the characters live and operate and pointedly avoids a slick look. Jackie BrownProductionA Miramax release of an A Band Apart production.

Jackson Michael Keaton Bridget Fonda; MPAA Rating R Posted January 9 1998 -- 1200 AM EST In virtually every scene of Quentin Tarantinos Jackie Brown (Miramax) you know youre watching a movie by the creator of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs but the fizz -- the exhilaration -- is gone. Its like viewing Pulp Fiction through bulletproof glass. Adapting the 1992 Elmore Leonard novel Rum Punch Tarantino spins a twisty crime yarn that on the surface at least appears to have most of the qualities that gave his earlier films their wild narcotic charge. He tells the story of Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) an economically desperate 44-year-old flight attendant who has been running cash for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson) a small-time Los Angeles arms dealer. When Jackie is cornered by a wily ATF agent (Michael Keaton) she figures that the only way out of her dilemma out of her life is to double-cross both parties. So she joins forces with a chivalrous bail bondsman (Robert Forster) and becomes in essence a criminal undercover agent crafting a plan to steal half a million dollars from Ordell even as she nails him for the Feds. Once again Tarantinos characters speak in confetti bursts of profanity and ironically literate back talk. The plot is like a souped-up engine propelling the movie onto off-ramps of duplicity and bloodshed and there are pungent performances from Robert De Niro as a befuddled sociopath Bridget Fonda as a jaded surf bunny and most prominently Jackson as the volatile Ordell who has murder in his eyes and funk poetry on his lips. So why does Jackie Brown for all its flair feel less than inspired? In Tarantinos earlier pictures the material refracted through a prism of pop sources fused chemically in the filmmakers brain. Whatever he put on screen be it John Travolta dancing or Michael Madsen slicing off someones ear he was so entranced by the mad-scientist power of his own imagination that we shared in his wide-eyed gaze. In Jackie Brown Tarantino is still entranced only in a more detached self-conscious way. The picture is an homage to two of the pop phenomena that formed him the crime fiction of Elmore Leonard and the underground stardom of blaxploitation queen Pam Grier who thanks to Tarantino is now resurrected. Tarantino doesnt just love these artists; hes lost in reverence for them. And in effect what he has done is to freeze them in his hero worship. Jackie Brown is an oxymoron Its like a scuzz-bucket film noir directed by Stanley Kubrick at his most static-mesmeric. Each scene is staged methodically overdeliberately as if it concealed some payoff zinger. But the zingers dont arrive. All we see is a reasonably clever Elmore Leonard caper that needed to be treated as fast trashy fun. It doesnt help that Leonard isnt nearly the artist Tarantino is. Hes strictly a genre man with paper-thin characters and an amiable low-life spark to his busy lurching plots. Early on theres a tasty moment when Ordell seen in extra-long shot coolly murders a nattering jailbird (Chris Tucker) in the trunk of his car the brutal act framed by the spangly strains of ""Strawberry Letter 23."" The scene lets you know how casual it is for Ordell to pull that trigger. But its virtually the only moment when Tarantino comes at the action with a funny sidelong glance. Pam Grier looks marvelous with her diamond eyes and sexy half sneer and though the middle-aged bulkiness of her body gives you a bit of a start she is as always a commanding actress; she blends street smarts and melancholy the way she used to blend street smarts and Amazonian hauteur. The meaning of her presence however extends beyond that. In Jackie Brown Grier is the matriarch of Tarantinos I-wanna-be-black dream party. In the opening sequence the camera caresses her as she travels through an airport and the movie caresses us with the great lost Bobby Womack song ""Across 110th Street"" with its ghetto lament about ""doing whatever I had to do to survive."" Tarantino has recontextualized Rum Punch as a tale of African-American desperation. He sprinkles the word nigger around as if it were the verbal equivalent of cayenne pepper and he has Jackson play Ordell as a ruthless badass stud (with streaming long hair the actor looks like hes warming up to star in The Miles Davis Story). But this may all mean more to the filmmaker than it does to us. In Jackie Brown blackness becomes the signifier of Quentin Tarantinos integrity his artistic cool. He was cooler when he wasnt trying so hard to be.

Starring Pam Grier Samuel L. Jackson Robert Forster Bridget Fonda and Robert De Niro. Directed by Quentin Tarantino. (R. 150 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The saga of Quentin Tarantino is unique. Three years ago he was a critical and commercial darling with ""Pulp Fiction."" Then he went on to annoy everybody by showing up everywhere and producing bad movies and blabbing on talk shows to the extent that now with the release of ""Jackie Brown"" his first feature since ""Pulp Fiction"" its as if hes making a comeback. Maybe he understands the value of diminished expectations. Had ""Jackie Brown"" been released at the tail end of Quentinmania back when he was Orson Welles Jr. everybody would have been disappointed. But today with much of the public ready to write Tarantino off as either an idiot savant or an idiot ""Jackie Brown"" is looking like a fairly satisfactory piece of work. It might even be a wise career move Make a movie thats not so great as to annoy those rooting against you yet good enough that no one can deny your talent. One gets the feeling watching ""Jackie Brown"" that its the kind of film Tarantino could make once every 10 months for the rest of his life. The picture is an adaptation of Elmore Leonards 1995 best-seller ""Rum Punch"" but with the setting moved from Florida to Los Angeles and the dialogue Quentinized. The novels Jackie Burke a white woman has become Jackie Brown played by Pam Grier the legendary heroine of the blaxploitation films of the 70s. GIVING IT A 70S FEEL From the beginning Tarantino tries to give ""Jackie Brown"" the flavor of a 70s low-budget genre movie with interiors that evoke that decade and a soundtrack made up of early 70s funk music. It doesnt quite work. The music clashes with the modern-day setting and takes the audience out of the moment. Yet from the first scene there is the kick of once again entering a Tarantino universe. Samuel L. Jackson plays Ordell a dealer in illegal weapons who lectures a newly released ex-con about the relative merits of various guns ""Then theres the AK-47 when you absolutely positively have to kill every m-- in the room."" Tarantino introduces a number of characters and manages to keep track of all of them. Robert De Niro plays Ordells ex-con buddy a fairly bland role. Bridget Fonda has slightly more fun as Ordells girlfriend an ill-tempered pothead. But the heart of the story involves Jackie a 44- year-old flight attendant whos arrested for smuggling Ordells money across the Mexican border. The movie fully exploits Griers patented toughness in only one scene in which Jackie gets the drop on Ordell when he comes to kill her. Unfortunately Tarantino chooses to film that moment in almost total darkness. But Grier brings other qualities into the mix besides toughness poise an aura of fatalism and wisdom and an idiosyncratic style. Grier talks the way Johnny Cash sings -- out of the side of her mouth. ""Jackie Brown"" is essentially a caper movie in which Jackie and her smitten bail bondsman (Robert Forster) set out to steal half a million dollars from Ordell right under the noses of federal officers. But Tarantino jazzes up the story with characteristic comic touches. Crooks leave a crime scene and have trouble finding their car in a parking lot. Violence springs up for the silliest of reasons with a suddenness that stirs uneasy laughter. TARANTINO PLAYFUL Borrowing a trick from Stanley Kubricks ""The Killing"" Tarantino presents the same incident involving an exchange of money three times from three points of view. He does it for little reason besides sheer playfulness. But playfulness is OK. Theres something appealing in watching Tarantino borrow styles and techniques as if he were a kid taking items from a toy chest. Yet as the film wears on the mar riage of Leonard and Tarantino proves incompatible or at least rocky. Tarantinos playful asides and slow buildups rob Leonards caper story of its velocity. Scene by scene ""Jackie Brown"" is amusing but after two hours it seems sluggish and at that point still has a half-hour to go. The slow pace kills the sense of urgency and the length and breadth of the film makes the story seem insignificant. Tarantino is still someone to watch but ""Jackie Brown"" before its over becomes a who-cares proposition.

"Jackie Brown | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jackie-brown ) Jackie Brown (United States 1997) A movie review by James Berardinelli It has been three long years since Quentin Tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the Cannes Film Festivals Palme DOr a 100 million-plus box office gross and an Oscar nomination a all for his sophomore outing Pulp Fiction. Since then the talented film maker has been virtually invisible surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven Four Rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest From Dusk Till Dawn. In between he has moonlighted as an ""actor"" with several decidedly unmemorable performances. Now with much fanfare and anticipation Tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort Jackie Brown. And while this motion picture adapted from Elmore Leonards novel Rum Punch offers solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from Tarantino will leave theaters disappointed. For the most part Jackie Brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie. The story which starts out slowly develops into a twisty affair with double-crosses and triple- crosses. And the movie is littered with occasional Tarantino trademarks witty dialogue unexpected gunfire 70s pop tunes and close-ups of womens bare feet. Yet for all of that the production is something of a letdown. The sheer in-your-face exuberance that marked Reservoir Dogs and especially Pulp Fiction is absent. The mostly-straightforward chronology of Jackie Brown doesnt match up favorably to the non-linear style of Tarantinos previous efforts a an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives. And there arent nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around. Theres a Samuel L. Jackson monologue about guns a Jackson/Chris Tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk and a Jackson/Robert De Niro exchange that recalls some of the Jackson/Travolta material from Pulp Fiction but thats about it. Jackie Browns lone ""innovation"" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives. This isnt exactly an original technique a it has been done numerous times before most famously in Akira Kurosawas Rashomon and most recently in Edward Zwicks Courage Under Fire. However while in those two movies (and others) there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of-view Tarantinos sole purpose for using it appears to be because its unconventional. Had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages nothing would have been lost. As a result this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity. For the second picture in a row Tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a 70s icon. This time around instead of John Travolta its Blaxploitation queen Pam Grier (Foxy Brown has become Jackie Brown). In one of many nods to the most famous segment of Griers career Tarantino uses a 70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits. There are also several instances during Jackie Brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the Blaxploitation genre (although Grier never does any butt- kicking). Grier is Jackie Brown a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the United States. Shes working for gun dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) a Federal official. No longer sure whether or not he can trust Jackie Ordell arranges for a bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster TVs ""Banyon"") to post the necessary 10000 then plans to shoot Jackie if she proves disloyal. Jackie passes Ordells test however and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle 500000 of Ordells money into the United States without tipping off the Feds. Soon just about everyone is after that money including Jackie Max Ray Ordells perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend Melanie (Bridget Fonda) and his right-hand man Louis (Robert De Niro). Unsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in by Samuel L. Jackson but Ordell isnt nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as Jules from Pulp Fiction. In addition to looking fantastic Pam Grier is also quite good although hers is not an Oscar-caliber performance (although she might get a nomination). Robert Forster and Michael Keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely-smile roles. Bridget Fonda is around for three discernible reasons to look sexy in a bikini to provide a little twisted comedy and to satisfy Tarantinos foot fetish. Robert De Niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy-looking middle-aged actor. The film which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a-half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout (although the payoff is a letdown). Tarantino keeps things moving along nicely with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in Pulp Fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself. When it comes to recent caper films (like The Grifters and Bound) Jackie Brown is a second-tier effort. Its an entertaining diversion but not a masterpiece and certainly not an Oscar contender.
