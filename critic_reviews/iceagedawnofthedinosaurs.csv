Comments click to enlarge Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs Free 2009 Not even 3D can save this third entry in the Fox animation franchise about a motley crew of prehistoric creatures. This time they face threats from beneath the earths frozen crust as Sid the sloth discovers a trio of dinosaur eggs adopts the hatchlings and earns the wrath of their mama a Tyrannosaurus rex. Simon Pegg provides the voice of a buccaneer weasel that leads the gang through one chase after another; the manic pace quickly grows tiresome as does the influx of cloying baby animals. Carlos Saldanha and Mike Thurmeier directed; among the other voice talent are Ray Romano Queen Latifah Denis Leary and John Leguizamo. PG 87 min.

In fact some of the 3D elements in Blue Skys latest prehistoric critter circus are so subtle you may not notice them. What you wont miss are the films exhilarating action sequences and electrifyingly vibrant palette.Some dramatic changes are occurring in the lives of Manny the mammoth Sid the sloth and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger. Manny is preoccupied with a pregnant partner Diegos lost his mojo and is having a midlife crisis and lisping loser Sid... well is it any wonder he doesnt have a family of his own? Following a minor tiff Sid wanders off falls through the ice and discovers three dinosaur eggs which he adopts - until big mama Rex comes trundling into the frame. In a nod to Journey to the Centre of the Earth the rest unfolds in a Cretaceous underworld where Manny and Co - aided by a cocky new weasel character - attempt an audacious rescue. Some have expressed displeasure at the design and voices of the leads. I disagree - but I do think Simon Peggs Artful Dodger-like weasel is a vocal cliche too far. Similarly some of the anarchic comical segues featuring Scrat the squirrel and a newfound love are beginning to feel overfamiliar. As with the two earlier films its all a mite disorderly in tempo but often highly amusing and great fun in the main.

ABOUT THE MOVIEIce Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs   out of fourVoices Ray Romano John Leguizamo Denis Leary Queen LatifahDirectors Carlos Saldanha and Mike ThurmeierDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG for some mild rude humor and perilRunning time 1 hour 34 minutesOpens Wednesday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs seems to be suffering from freezer burn. Once fresh the story is now buried under a hoary coating. The theme of creating unlikely families worked well the first time from both a comic and narrative standpoint. Its consistently sweet message notwithstanding the retread plot is a bore. VIDEO Watch the trailer The 3-D animation is something new for the franchise. And while its eye-catching the saga doesnt hold a candle to Pixars Up which integrates 3-D images artfully into a compelling story that elicits emotions and captures the imagination. The species are more plentiful this time but Ice Age resorts to bathroom humor and gross bodily fluids to fill the landscape. Life is taking a serious turn for woolly mammoth Manny (Ray Romano) and his mate Ellie (Queen Latifah) as they await the arrival of their first offspring. Mannys neurotic tendencies are in high gear. Diego (Denis Leary) the saber-toothed tiger is annoyed with Mannys domesticity. Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) longing for offspring takes over a trio of giant eggs and cares for the hatchlings as if they were his own. Sid has gender and identity issues referring to himself as ""a single mother"" to little comic effect. Sids new family turns out to be infant dinosaurs and he is led into a scary parallel underground universe. His herd mates -- Manny Ellie and Diego -- must rescue him. Along the way they meet a dinosaur-hunting weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg). But their perilous adventure is not unlike what weve seen in Jurassic Park movies a T. rex storms around raptors loom and pterodactyls swoop. Scrat the squirrel (Chris Wedge) reappears scrambling to grab on to his beloved acorn. He meets a comely female squirrel who joins in the chase. Romance clouds the hunt but the acorn reigns supreme. Kristen Wiig Bill Hader and Jane Lynch lend humorous vocal touches to peripheral animal characters. But rather than evolving Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs treads on familiar and infertile ground.

"Movie Review Michael OSullivan on Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +| Comments MOVIES Movie Review Michael OSullivan on Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs Scrat a squirrel who had minor roles in the first two films in the franchise hogs screen time in a movie that defies known paleontology. (Twentieth Century Fox Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday July 1 2009 I like Scrat. You like Scrat. We all apparently like Scrat. This StoryMOVIES 3rd Ice Age Isnt Worth DiscoveringSummer Movie Guide 2009Find Showtimes Tickets But no one I suspect likes the saber-toothed cartoon squirrel -- who along with his beloved ever-out-of-reach acorn made only brief appearances in both of the first two ""Ice Age"" films -- enough to want to watch a whole movie about him. Nevertheless there he is popping up seemingly every 10 minutes in ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" the third and barely funny installment in the series of animated features about the prehistoric adventures of Manny (voice of Ray Romano) Diego (Denis Leary) and Sid (John Leguizamo) a woolly mammoth saber-toothed tiger and ground sloth stuck in a snowbound world. Scrats annoying ubiquity -- compounded by the appearance of a new female love interest Scratte (Karen Disher) -- is just one piece of evidence that ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" has been focus-grouped and is now trying to please its presumed young audience a little more than is healthy. Others include jumping on the digital 3-D bandwagon and introducing not one but three adorable baby T. rexes. Of course theres nothing wrong with cute. And there is a little vinegar to temper all that sugar. Simon Pegg makes a nice acerbic addition to the cast as Buck a leathery one-eyed weasel who carries a sharpened dino tooth for a dagger and who acts as a native guide when our heroes discover a lushly tropical world of still-living dinosaurs hidden under all that ice. Thats right. Never mind the improbable physics and imaginative paleontology of that scenario (let alone the fact that the Ice Age seemed to be over in the last sequel ""Ice Age The Meltdown""). Logic should never stand in the way of squeezing one more chapter out of a popular movie franchise. What propels Manny and company underground is the pursuit of Sid whos been abducted by the mama T. rex after Sid attempts to raise her three offspring in a fit of misplaced parental instincts. It seems that even Sid wants babies especially after Mannys woolly-mammoth consort Ellie (Queen Latifah introduced in the last film) is discovered to be with child. Complicating matters is the arrival of Rudy the nasty beastie who took Bucks eye and lost a tooth in the deal. Resembling a giant albino crocodile hes scary all right -- my 9-year-old son insisted on holding my hand at one point -- but he never really feels like anything more than a plot device. Thats really in a nutshell the whole problem with ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs."" It looks like a real movie all right. And its got all the features people want more Scrat dino-babies 3-D and the resurfacing of the themes of family and togetherness that were the hallmark of the first two films. Its not utterly without charm either. Only here that charm feels less earned than manufactured a product not of evolution -- or even intelligent design -- but of cynical soulless opportunism. Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs (87 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for cartoon violence and humor related to various body parts and functions. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  3rd Ice Age Isnt Worth Discovering Summer Movie Guide 2009 Find Showtimes Tickets",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/30/AR2009063003821.html,200,iceagedawnofthedinosaurs6,iceagedawnofthedinosaurs,washingtonpost

Ice Age goes down easy even if the impact melts away. Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday June 30 2009 422 PM Title Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs If ""Up"" is the animated equivalent of an ice cream sundae ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is the Popsicle Neither as rich nor as memorable but more than welcome on a long hot summer day.Or maybe itll be parents who are most grateful since this rambunctious outing--the third in the franchise--is cute enough to engage kids and just smart enough to keep the chaperones entertained.Ray Romano and Queen Latifah return to voice Ellie and Manny woolly mammoths expecting their first child. Their buddy Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) is feeling pretty left out so he finds some kids of his own three newborn dinosaurs.Eventually their mom comes to take them home but Sid isnt about to be intimidated by a T. rex and chases after them. Much to everyones surprise they live in a secret underground valley where dinos roam free.When Sid disappears in search of the babies the whole gang--which also includes Denis Learys saber-toothed tiger and the delightfully obsessive squirrel Scrat--faces some serious trouble. Not even a mammoth can stand up to a brontosaurus and there are threats around every corner. Their only chance is to hook up with a wild-eyed weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg) a loony local who offers to serve as protector and tour guide.With Ellies pregnancy is a primary plot point this may be the most domesticated kids movie ever. Its hard to imagine nursery decor and delivery preparations have ever received more attention. But the cast makes the most of the good-natured if unchallenging script with Peggs off-the-wall newcomer an especially amusing standout.Threequels are notorious letdowns so the filmmakers deserve a little extra credit for keeping up with the series which has always been reliable rather than groundbreaking family entertainment. Nicely enhanced with vivid 3-D imagery ""Ice Age"" goes down easy even if the impact melts away with relative speed.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Woolly mammoths Manny left and Ellie with possums Crash and Eddie struggle to survive in the new animated feature film Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs. Photo 20TH CENTURY FOX ASSOCIATED PRESS Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs 1 / 1 Back to Gallery If youre a paleontologist chances are good youve given up on movies altogether. First there was last years 10000 B.C. which suggested that woolly mammoths helped build the pyramids in Egypt. And now we have Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs a film that will lead children to believe that the Jurassic period came after mammoths and sabertooth tigers walked the Earth. The animated family movie genre isnt supposed to be documentary filmmaking. (Seen any helium balloon-powered houses flying through the air lately?) But its harder to forgive a 140 million-year mistake when the finished product is mediocre. If the third Ice Age was a bit better there would be little need to dwell on the inconsistencies. Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs will satisfy its young fan base and is bound to make a ton of money. At this point though the series is no longer an artistic pursuit; its a business deal. Its doubtful that the makers of the prehistoric adventure picture added dinosaurs because that story needed to be told -- or even made sense in the context of the franchise. They did it because a T-Rex looks good on the movie poster. The film begins with mammoth Manny (voice by Ray Romano) and his pregnant wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) getting ready to settle down. This causes friction with Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) who wants his own family and Diego the sabertooth tiger (Denis Leary) who is dealing with unspecified aging issues. Sid finds some dinosaur eggs and pretty soon the friends discover another world under the ice which is bright and lush and filled with dinosaurs. Of the group Sid has the best story arc. His attempts to nurture three young tyrannosaurs are good for some entertaining physical comedy. Scratte also returns this time with a love interest. The interludes in the first two films involving the rodentlike creatures attempts to get a nut were always a nice homage to the classic Warner Bros. cartoons; this time theres a strong Pepe Le Pew vibe. But too much of the rest of the comedy is uninspired. With most of the characters from the first two films plus a few new ones in the dinosaur world theres barely time to adequately explore anyones predictable conflicts. The last half of the movie is a constant state of characters getting rescued -- there are rescues within the rescues -- interrupted by the occasional slapstick bit or one-liner too many of which seem to be genitalia-related. ""Let me tell you about the time that I used a clam shell to turn a T-Rex into a T-Rachel"" a weasel character declares in the middle of the film. Thats one of three penis-themed jokes that we counted -- which is probably three penis jokes too many in a movie that doesnt feature Harold and Kumar going to White Castle. phartlaubsfchronicle.com Todays Deals TechRabbit LG Sale Up to 95% off from 2 + free shipping 3P Military Tactical Oxford 30L Backpack for 12 + free shipping Lenovo Sale Up to 36% off + free shipping Sperry Mens Baitfish Leather Flip Flops for 35 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Movies by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Blue Sky Studios) Posted July 1 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT The bar for 3-D animated movies has been set high. This year alone the skewed demonic fairy tale Coraline the pop-up-book clever Monsters vs. Aliens and the wondrous and heart-lifting Up make tough acts to follow. So maybe that explains why Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs has a little trouble measuring up. After a sensational opening few minutes in which Scrat the saber-toothed squirrel does high-flying battle with the squirrel he loves (all for a tasty acorn) the movie settles into a mode of nice sweet safe and -- sorry I have to say it -- slightly dull family fun. Our glacier-happy regulars have been hanging out for so long now that they seem a bit jaded. Manny and Ellie (Ray Romano and Queen Latifah) the woolly mammoths are set to have a baby and Diego (Denis Leary) the saber-toothed tiger is still a freelance grouch. Leave it to Sid (John Leguizamo) the lisping sloth to discover three cuddly baby T. rexes who lead them all to a viny green prehistoric jungle packed with dinosaurs. A fight with a massive carnivorous plant is neatly executed and the whole trippy-fauna look of the movie is lost-world magical but Dawn of the Dinosaurs just isnt very funny. It lopes and slogs where the first two Ice Age movies popped.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post To say theres nothing new in the latest installment of ""Ice Age"" would mean slighting the fact that woolly mammoths Manny and Ellie are about to become parents. And a new baby is always cause for celebration trepidation and a sequel. ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" plunges its loving affably voiced herd of Ice Age animals into two daunting worlds that of parenthood and that of hungry dinosaurs. Will the new arrival change the meaning of this wonderfully improvised herd? Of course. But thats the hook as saber-toothed tiger Diego possums Crash and Eddie and a sloth named Sid wrestle with their changing roles. Fast-talking Sid (voiced by fast-talking John Leguizamo) wonders what kind of parent hed make. Then he finds three enormous eggs. His new brood of razor- toothed baby dinos belongs to a lush and dangerous world beneath the ice. The only one who seems to know what shes doing is Ellie (voice of Queen Latifah). There has always been something soothing and admirable about Ellie who nudges her various menfolk to understand themselves and the world better. As Manny Ray Romano is more comfortable taking direction from his brainier mate than figuring out whats going on with his best friend Diego (Denis Leary). If interpersonal lessons are the bread of animated features then mishaps and mild mayhem are their butter. Will the herd survive the journey to the center of this land of the lost? This is PG fare so you neednt worry. A swashbuckling weasel named Buck obsessed with a white T. rex acts as the herds guide and protector. Still the finest idiosyncratic pleasure of this franchise remains the ongoing relationship of hapless squirrel-rat Scrat to his beloved acorn. When another character the flirtatious Scratte arrives threes a crowd and a challenge. And the filmmakers have a fine time teasing us with who the third wheel really is. The scenes could make an animated short of their own. Instead theyre strung throughout the larger tale. That clever weaving remains both innovative and old-school cartoon work at its finest. ""ICE AGE DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS"" PG for some mild rude humor and peril. 1 hour 34 minutes. Directed by Carlos Saldanha and Michael Thurmeier; written by Michael Berg Peter Akerman Mike Reiss and Yoni Brenner; starring the voices of Ray Romano John Leguizamo Denis Leary Simon Pegg Queen Latifah.

Share Tweet Apart from a solid voice cast and pretty good computer animation heres what the movie Ice Age had for it when it debuted in 2002 the ice age a whole swath of pre-history that hardly anyone had exploited before. Let other movies have their velociraptors and their T. Rexes--here was a movie happily filled with mammoths and saber-toothed cats. The series kept it going for one more entry but throws its commitment to the era away with movie number three a ploy sure to anger Ice Age purists everywhere. Youre probably saying to yourself ""Dinosaurs didnt survive into the ice age. How can this be?"" Heres how Early on bumbling sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) feeling a bit out of place thanks to the impending fatherhood of his mammoth friend Manny (Ray Romano) wanders off and discovers a cave containing some eggs. What Sid doesnt realize--and heres the clever loophole that allows Ice Age Dawn Of The Dinosaurs to feature dinosaurs--is that said eggs are in fact dinosaur eggs swiped from an underground cave in which dinosaurs remain alive and well a veritable Jurassic park if you will. After the eggs hatch Sid is kidnapped by a dinosaur mom none-too-happy about the theft. This forces his friends to enter the ahem lost world in order to rescue him. What follows crude jokes sweet lessons Simon Pegg as an adventurer gone insane and a bunch of decent animation which select patrons will see in impressive 3-D. Ideally theyll be about 8 years old and hopped up on Junior Mints. Otherwise theyll be pretty bored and forced to think about things like whether or not the Ice Age series should have just stuck with the ice age.

Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs comes wrapped in warm fuzzies | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsIce Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs comes wrapped in warm fuzziesIce Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a Jurassic lark.Simon Pegg joins the Ice Age gang as Buck the pirate weasel.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. July 1 2009 Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs (out of 4)Animation featuring the voices of Ray Romano Queen Latifah Denis Leary John Leguizamo and Simon Pegg. 94 minutes. At major theatres. G Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a Jurassic lark.This third trip to the Ice Age cooler should delight families with its amusing new dino buddies even as it risks terrifying tots. Theres a marauding Tyrannosaurus rex that isnt interested in laughs.In the main though the film is a hoot no matter whether you see it in conventional 2-D or the available 3-D version. Its also arguably the best to date in the franchise directed once again by Carlos Saldanha who also helmed second chapter Ice Age The Meltdown.Family values turn to tribal trauma after woolly mammoths Manny (voiced by Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) announce to their prehistoric pack that theyre expecting a bouncing bundle of fur.Sabre-toothed tiger Diego (Denis Leary) takes this as his cue to go solo (no way is he babysitting) while nutso sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) has the opposite reaction regretting his lack of offspring.Both find immediate relief as Diego splits while Sid sits like Dr. Seusss Horton the Elephant upon three dino eggs he happens upon. Rather Sid tries to sit upon them; the eggs prove to be a real handful especially when they hatch into three boisterous biters.Trouble really ensues when the mother dinosaur comes looking for her brood leading the Ice Age crew into an underground world that time forgot - and which palaeontologists must forgive.There they meet Buck (Simon Pegg) a weasel with an eye patch who seems to think hes a pirate. Buck looks like trouble but he proves to be a valuable ally when the going gets rough and the T rex comes thundering.The expanded family dynamics extend to Scrat (Chris Wedge) the acorn-chasing squirrel whose slapstick antics also enlivened the first two Ice Age movies. He now has both a love interest and a competitor in female squirrel Scratte (Karen Disher) their frolics goofily set to a Lou Rawls tune. It could drive a guy nuts but families should herd themselves to the multiplex for Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

But as with Shrek and countless other over-extended studio franchises the well has run bone-dry. Part Three sends woolly mammoths Manny (Ray Romano) a very pregnant Ellie (Queen Latifah) and the rest of their cobbled-together family of misfits to a lush land below the ice thats fraught with dangers--like a burping purple plant that ingests foreigners--and teeming with the endlessly marketable dinosaurs so carelessly dispatched in the first movie. However spuriously gussied-up with 3-D this verdant underworld is a playground for animation geeks but its narrative pull hovers around zero unless you count the lame post-millennial jokes about helicopter parents and single dads doubling as single moms and even those are nothing but an excuse to float a raft of cuddly prehistoric babies for audience tots and their elders to coo over. Even with the addition of an (obligatory Cockney) weasel (Simon Pegg) to steer the herd through the usual slalom ride of hot lava and hostile beasties theres no breathing life into a formula that ought to have bowed out gracefully while the going was good.

Their parents will no doubt be amused by the idea that this time dinosaurs coexist with woolly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers -- at least in a subterranean world that seems immune to the global warming that thawed the last installment ""Ice Age The Meltdown."" MOVIE BLOG Can A Cute Sloth Topple the Mighty Transformers? There is much more of an emphasis on action in this nicely crafted fast-paced sequel which at its best shares the antic qualities of classic Warner Bros. cartoons. Ray Romano returns as the voice of the neurotic woolly mammoth Manny with Queen Latifah as his now-pregnant wife -- and Denis Leary as his pal the saber-toothed Diego who is feeling left out by the impending blessed event. The plot is set into motion when the wacky sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) finds some dinosaur eggs and -- very amusingly -- decides to hatch them himself. Of course this is not a great idea and leads to the others having to rescue poor Sid from a pack of dinosaurs. The major new character is a one-eyed (and quite demented) swashbuckling weasel named Buck buckling weasel named Buck (voiced by a very funny Simon Pegg) who seems to owe a lot to Johnny Depps Capt. Jack Sparrow in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies. Theres less dialogue than in the previous episodes with much screen time devoted to interludes featuring the mischievous and hyper squirrel Scrat who finds love with another member of his species. Blue Sky Studios -- responsible for the delightful ""Horton Hears a Who"" as well as the ""Ice Age"" movies -- may not turn out masterpieces like Pixars ""Up."" But theyve been consistently making toons superior to the much-hyped DreamWorks Animation which relies too heavily on celebrity voices and cultural references. Director Carlos Saldanha encoring from ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" keeps things moving at a rapid clip and uses 3-D far more imaginatively and effectively than in DWAs ""Monsters vs. Aliens."" ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" makes especially clever use of music including several variations on the Lou Rawls classic ""Youll Never Find Another Love Like Mine."" Even Gilbert OSullivans ""Alone Again (Naturally)"" turns up. ICE AGE DAWN OF THE DINOSAURS Third times the charm. Running time 94 minutes. Rated PG (mild rude humor peril).

Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Buck (voice of Simon Pegg right) is hot on the trail of a ferocious dinosaur with the Brothers Possum in tow. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox The animated comedy Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs is the eighth movie Hollywood has released this year in 3-D. By the end of 2009 there will have been 13 films for which audiences will have worn special polarized glasses compared with just one in 2003 -- and none at all in the decade before that. The 3-D revolution is really and truly with us in other words -- so without pretending were going into too much depth lets have a look at three dimensions of the latest Ice Age iteration that really matter Dimension One Characters. Start with Scrat that single-minded saber-toothed squirrel still sniffing and snuffling in search of his beloved acorn. As always he finds it and as always something keeps him from enjoying it -- in this case a squirrel-fatale whos every bit as acorn-crazed as he is. At first they have a Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote-type relationship but her hold over him becomes progressively more domestic until hes a henpecked hubby rearranging the furniture in their love nest while gazing longingly at the acorn from afar. Also back for another round woolly mammoths Manny and Ellie (voiced by Ray Romano and Queen Latifah) who have a mini-mammoth on the way. That happy expectation means their hapless little chosen family of ice-age misfits -- Diego (Denis Leary) a saber-toothed tiger whos learned not to eat his buddies and Sid (John Leguizamo) a sloth whose mental ice tray is a couple of cubes short -- are feeling left out. Which brings us to Dimension Two Plot. When Sid falls through a hole in the ice into a warmer center-of-the-Earth-style world he finds three enormous eggs and decides to use them to start a family of his own. Alas their biological parent -- a T. rex -- isnt pleased and she spirits the hatchlings and Sid down to her world whereupon adventures ensue. Some of those scrapes involve a swashbuckling weasel who Im afraid I left out in Dimension One. Which is no small oversight because hes voiced by Simon Pegg as a cross between Errol Flynn and Johnny Depp at his Jack Sparrow-est. As the lone resident mammal in the otherwise reptilian world under the ice -- he apparently fell through long ago and got acclimated -- he more or less takes over the second half of the picture. And so we arrive at Dimension Three How does the Ice Age message -- basically ""Cant we all just work past our differences and get along?"" -- translate to 3-D? Well it certainly plays out with more visual depth though the animators dont insist on shoving things into your lap every three seconds. Dont get me wrong When pterodactyls fly over your shoulder its plenty persuasive but the effect is becoming natural enough that I actually forgot for much of the picture that I was wearing glasses. Dimensions One and Two -- characters and plot -- are primary here as they should be technical wizardry notwithstanding. In fact unlike say Monsters Vs. Aliens which would have been nothing at all without its special-effects spectacle this is a sweet little comedy both family-friendly and centered on a nontraditional family and so suitable for pretty much everyone. Everyone that is who can get past the not-really-minor probably inescapable fact that come next fall elementary-school teachers everywhere will face classes full of kids absolutely convinced that an ice age marked the dawn of the dinosaurs. Theyll have seen it at the movies after all -- and in lifelike 3-D too. Web Resources ""Ice Age Dawn Of The Dinosaurs"" Official Site Correction July 2 2009 The broadcast version of this story mistakenly said that an ice age ""marked the death of the dinosaurs.""

Liam Lacey From Wednesdays Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Jun. 30 2009 419PM EDT Last updated Saturday Jul. 04 2009 403AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs Directed by Carlos Saldanha and Mike Thermeier Written by Michael Berg Peter Ackerman Mike Reiss Yoni Brenner Featuring the voices of Ray Romano John Leguizamo Denis Leary Queen Latifah Simon Pegg Classification PG In Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs every character is like the hyperactive rat-squirrel Scrat and the audience is bounced around like his elusive acorn. The third in the series of prehistoric animated comedies for children Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs returns to a familiar cast of characters and a message about the survival power of family. By the conclusion of this manic brain-rattling exercise though parents may well be thinking ""Hurrah for extinction."" To be fair anyone who is not watching this film in 3-D including those of us at the press screening may be at a big disadvantage. The filmmakers have focused on non-stop action with a succession of thrill-ride sequences that presumably pop out very effectively if youre wearing 3-D glasses. If youre not wearing them they just seem like one gratingly antic sub-Steven Spielberg action sequence. The misadventures of the acorn-chasing Scrat which were previously sequestered into stand-alone shorts have now been integrated into the main movie. But more slapstick scenes with Scrat and the addition of a new foxy plush-tailed character named Scratte provides more contrivance but less charm. There are only a few brief moments to settle down with the amiable voice cast. Followers of the previous two Ice Age s will be familiar with the prehistoric couple of Manny (Ray Romano) a neurotic mammoth and his mate Ellie (Queen Latifah). As the movie starts the pair is expecting a baby mammoth and all the rest of the gang are feeling a little left out. Their extended family includes the earnest sabre-toothed tiger Diego (Denis Leary) who feels that too much domestication is causing him to lose his edge and its time to move on. The slow-witted sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) starts feeling his own paternal pangs and adopts a trio of mysterious eggs which he finds under the ice. The only ones who are unaffected are the nutty sibling possums Crash and Eddie (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck) who continue to raise havoc and off-putting odours. Soon those three eggs hatch producing three baby dinosaurs. They immediately fix on Sid as their new mother but they are too rambunctious and carnivorous for him to handle. When their Godzilla-sized mother T-Rex emerges from her underground home to get back her babies she picks them up in her jaws along with Sid and heads back underground. The rest of the extended family goes on a rescue mission descending into a world full of trees and grass and fresh dangers. They are soon introduced to a new character Buck (Simon Pegg) a British-accented weasel who fancies himself a swashbuckling pirate and combines Captain Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean and Moby-Dick s Captain Ahab. Buck is obsessed with a giant white dinosaur named Rudy who rules the underground realm. There are encounters with flesh-eating plants raptors and a squadron of pterodactyls each of which provides opportunities for more simulated theme-park rides. The screenplay is credited to four writers including original Ice Age co-writers Michael Berg and Peter Ackerman but theres little evidence of creativity either in the paint-by-numbers time-travelling plot or the sort of ad-libs you associate with gag writers sitting around a boardroom table. Most of the banter here is less inspired than incessant. Too many of the mildly off-colour jokes seem targeted at some puerile void between parents and children.

But theres a reason they team up in this 3-D sequel anyway. Dinosaurs are cool.For those who need more justification the screenwriters of this third installment in the ""Ice Age series offer up a stale and sketchy premise. Their story involves a lost world that plays out far beneath the frozen tundra where lush tropical jungles somehow thrive Jurassic beasts still roar and the most menacing creatures turn out to be total softies once you get to know them.""Dawn of the Dinosaurs begins as every movie in this franchise has with the travails of a hapless show-stealing fanged squirrel named Scrat (voiced by Chris Wedge director of the original ""Ice Age). Scrat is forever enthralled with a prized acorn that keeps slipping from his grasp but in this film his love for the nut is tested by a beguiling female. Their fiery romance set to a Lou Rawls soundtrack gives Scrat more screen time than ever; unfortunately its largely wasted on cliches (he muscles her during a tango; she makes him rearrange the furniture) barely befitting an episode of ""Everybody Loves Raymond.Meanwhile the official stars of the movie have their own tired tango to dance for directors Carlos Saldanha (""Ice Age The Meltdown) and Michael Thurmeier. As mammoths Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) prepare to welcome their first offspring Diego the saber-toothed cat (Denis Leary) contemplates leaving the herd to regain his predatory edge. The possums Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck) bicker as usual. And lovable lisping Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo) bonds with a trio of dinosaur eggs.When mama T-rex comes looking for her triplets and kidnaps Sid as well Manny and the gang are plunged into an adventure that pulls them far underground through the Jungle of Misery over the Chasm of Death across the Plates of Woe right to the brink of Lava Falls. Their guide through all of this is Buck (Simon Pegg) a crazed swashbuckling weasel with a leafy eye-patch and a Cockney accent. Hes a spirited and mildly funny addition to the cast but hes not a shining comet like Sacha Baron Cohens King Julien in ""Madagascar.Thats too bad because ""Dawn of the Dinosaurs sure could have used something to grab onto. Its mostly flat despite being presented in 3-D and the writing is so unimaginative that at one point a character yells out ""yabba dabba dooThere are a few stirring sequences including a swooping flight aboard a pterodactyl. Subterranean landscapes are richly drawn. Theres also enough snarling peril (parents beware) to quicken the pulse of young viewers.Yes dinosaurs are cool. Just not cool enough to save this sequel.

One might call this feeble attempt to wring every last nickel from a moderately enjoyable franchise The Crass Menagerie.The best thing about the Ice Age movies has always been the tangential plotline about Scrat the very hungry rodent who stalks an elusive acorn to the ends of the earth. The worst thing about this one is that the films other wild and woolly characters stalk an even more elusive story.It seems that the imminent parenthood of woolly mammoths Manny and Ellie (Ray Romano and Queen Latifah) threatens to break up the old gang that includes saber-toothed tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and sloth Sid (John Leguizamo).Although until now the Ice Age creatures have been happily heterogeneous Manny and Ellie seem as though they might retreat into a mammoths-only universe leaving their pals in the cold. So worried is Sid that Manny and Ellie are expecting and that he will be forever displaced that he adopts three eggs he finds in a cave. They become Tyrannosaurus hatchlings.The visual idea behind the movie is to put the Ice Age creatures into an unfamiliar Jurassic landscape. The films plot if one can call it that involves the return of the Tyrannosaurus Regina to reclaim her hatchlings and take Sid to a lush tropical underworld so different from Sids familiar icy territory.Though there are chases galore and stampeding dinos aplenty Dawn of the Dinosaurs is a nicely rendered travelogue without storytelling. There is little to bring an audience along for the ride.This said the films animation art is Seuss-imaginative. And it deploys its 3-D wisely to show the depth of valleys the crystalline texture of snow and the molten glow of lava. The depth of these effects serves mostly to make the flatness of the story and indifferent voicework all the more obvious.Director Carlos Saldanha did such an excellent job infusing the second installment with energy that its a shame he was unable to do the same with Part 3.The liveliest aspect to Yawn of the Dinosaurs is Buck (voice of Simon Pegg) a hyperkinetic piratical one-eyed weasel reminiscent of the lemur voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen in Madagascar. Buck has the effect on the movie that a candy bar has on a hungry kid First the sugar rush then the crash.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" Movie Review The second ""Ice Age"" film was like most thawed refrozen and re-thawed entrees somewhat lacking in freshness. The recent 3-D remake of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" was fun but a bit of a disappointment for its studio financially. So that makes doing yet another ""Ice Age"" cartoon -- in 3-D this time and with a plot lifted from ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" -- a really great idea right? Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs (PG) Fox (87 min.) Directed by Carlos Saldanha and Mike Thurmeier. With the voices of Ray Romano Denis Leary Queen Latifah John Leguizamo. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO STARS Rating note The film contains some scary dinosaurs. Only in the strange negative-numbers world of Hollywood where two wrongs equal a green light. The latest installment in the series has our furry quartet -- two mammoths a saber-toothed tiger and a bumbling sloth -- trudging their way across the prehuman world again. When suddenly the earth opens up beneath their feet and they find a new world. One full of dinosaurs rivers of lava and a swashbuckling weasel who promises to get them back home. This is pretty silly stuff even for a childrens movie and it sort of sells out the one original point the series used to have Here was a prehistoric adventure that refused to go the yabba-dabbo-do route. But dinosaurs sell -- or at least so folks thought before ""Land of the Lost"" disappeared. So cue the terrible lizards. And settle in for a nap. The original talent is back for this latest installment and the movie hits most of the same notes the last one did. True to form Ray Romanos mammoth grumbles Queen Latifahs calms him down Denis Learys tiger snarls toothlessly and John Leguizamo bumbles around as the busiest sloth in pictures. There are also -- always the best part of these movies -- more of the self-contained adventures of that speechless proto-squirrel and his endless search for acorns. But its all strictly by the numbers now. Some old and predictable pop songs (""Walk the Dinosaur"" naturally). Some lessons learned sort of. And then a big breakneck chase at the end and a quick fadeout. Actually the whole cartoon feels a little like a slow fadeout. Theres nothing new here and not nearly enough jokes. Unlike the Pixar cartoons -- where you know every gags been polished until it positively shines -- the slapstick here feel tossed off. The animation remains strictly mindless CGI stuff too -- great at catching the iridescence of a bubble less good at the nuances of expression and emotion. Even the 3-D -- de rigueur these days -- delivers little. Very small children will laugh at the squirrels antics; their slightly older siblings may enjoy the junior ""Jurassic Park"" thrills. And Leguizamo -- who doesnt seem to be doing much else these days -- puts a lot of verve into Sid the sloth. But by this point the ""Ice Age"" series is beginning to feel like its characters -- big and creaky and headed for extinction.

Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs Director Carlos Saldanha. Cast Ray Romano Denis Leary Simon Pegg. Rating Rated PG for some mild rude humor and peril. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related John Leguizamo was no sloth in preparing for Ice Age role Ray Romanos Ice dreams Animated movies A movie like ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" pretty much is. Which is OK when the cast is as talented as Ray Romano Denis Leary and especially Simon Pegg. Romano and Leary return from the first two ""Ice Age"" movies sporting their own brand of weary put-upon sarcasm (thats a compliment by the way). The brilliant Pegg meanwhile is a newcomer here a more-than-welcome addition to the crew. This time around Manny the mammoth (Romano) and his wife Ellie (Queen Latifah) are about to have a baby. Mannys a nervous dad-to-be trying to get his world in order - and as the self-described biggest thing in that world its his world to command. Not for long. Hes distracted by impending parenthood. Diego (Leary) meanwhile finds that his edge is slipping a sabre-tooth tiger whos lost a step but still craves adventure in hopes of getting his groove back. And Sid (John Leguizamo) the goofy sloth decides hed like a family of his own. He gets one of a sort. Falling into a cave he finds three eggs and tends to them till they hatch. They turn out to be dinosaurs whose mother isnt very happy that theyre gone. She comes back for them grabs Sid in the bargain and soon all the main characters have followed them to a world beneath the ice in which dinosaurs presumed to be extinct still roam. The story is simple from there Find Sid and save him dodging danger along the way. But theyll need the help of the weasel Buck (Pegg) a one-eyed Captain Ahab sort driven insane by his pursuit of a terrifying gigantic albino dinosaur. (His imaginary cellphone conversation using a rock is especially funny. As they watch Manny tells Diego who envies Bucks freewheeling lifestyle ""Thats you in three weeks."") ""Ice Age"" tells a tale of friendship of belonging and in a nice touch doesnt go overboard with sappiness at the end (much). Peggs manic energy gives the franchise a boost. The animation is first-rate and the first look at the lost world beneath the ice is stunning particularly in 3-D. The story isnt particularly imaginative though and unlike with the best Pixar offerings you wont hear talk of best-picture nominations. But you will hear laughter and thats not a bad consolation.

"Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ice-age-dawn-of-the-dinosaurs ) Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs (United States 2009) June 29 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli With each release Pixar explores new themes and ideas. Meanwhile animation studios like Fox retread tired ""franchises"" like Ice Age. Never representative of more than mediocrity from a technical or story-based standpoint the Ice Age series has reached a new nadir with its third entry. Rather than adding an extra dimension to the entertainment the decision to release Dawn of the Dinosaurs in 3D merely gives the animators an opportunity to be more slipshod in their design and execution. For the most part the movie plays out like a demo for the video game careening from one improbable action sequence to the next. I can see how the challenge of mastering some of these puzzles might be fun in an interactive forum but theyre deadly dull in a movie. Once again the talking prehistoric mammals are back ready to embark upon another adventure. Manny the Mammoth (voice of Ray Romano) and his mate Ellie (Queen Latifa) are about to embark upon parenthood. Diego the Sabertooth Tiger (Denis Leary) feeling he has lost ""it"" elects to leave behind the herd and strike out on his own. And Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) decides that like Manny he wants a family of his own. He achieves this goal not by finding a female and doing it the old fashioned way but by discovering three unhatched dinosaur eggs. Soon he is being followed by three newly hatched T-Rexes which is okay until a perturbed mother shows up wondering where her babies are. It turns out that there is a lost world of dinosaurs under the ice and when Mama T-Rex kidnaps Sid and transports him down there Manny Ellie and Diego follow. They are soon joined by a crazy weasel (Simon Pegg) denizen of the underworld who spends his days and nights hunting the biggest baddest dinosaur of them all a gargantuan carnivore called ""Rudy."" In the previous Ice Age movies the best reasons to watch were related to the misadventures of Scrat the Sabertooth Squirrel the prehistoric equivalent of Wiley Coyote. In Dawn of the Dinosaurs Scrat is the only reason to watch. Here as always hes after the elusive acorn but he has also been given a foil/love interest something the adds a little variety to his neverending quest for sustenance. Scrat appears periodically throughout the film to liven things up but the proceedings get pretty dull when hes not around. Its no wonder that the Dawn of the Dinosaurs trailer focuses entirely on Scrat wisely ignoring everyone else. The movies ""values oriented"" themes pander to nuclear family moms and dads to the exclusion of all else. The humor is less than half-baked. Laughs are few and far between and more often than not relate to gender differences. (Example what happens when you try to ""milk"" a male cow?) Very little happens over the course of the film. What passes for a ""story"" is nothing more than a thinly-veiled excuse to incorporate dinosaurs into the proceedings presumably because theyre popular with little boys. Theyre a cross between the Jurassic Park breed and those that populated The Flintstones cartoon TV series and the adult T-Rex bears more than a passing resemblance to the one harassing Will Ferrell in Land of the Lost - probably an association Fox would prefer that viewers not make. The plot unfolds at a sloth-like pace with no indication that there was any real joy or creativity involved in the production. Dawn of the Dinosaurs has the feel of something that was assembled as quickly as possible before the franchises young built-in audience could outgrow the infantile protagonists. The most disappointing thing about Dawn of the Dinosaurs is the movies look. Im not going to complain about how cheesy the dinosaurs appear - that goes with the territory. After all this is a movie in which the main character is a talking Wooly Mammoth. But everything in this world is bland and generic. Theres no texture in the foreground and no detail in the background. Its a small step up from Saturday morning cartoon quality. The excuse I suppose is that the ""3D experience"" compensates but it also mutes the colors and dims the brightness. Dawn of the Dinosaurs looks awful. If I was one of the CGI animators Id be embarrassed to be associated with the film. I have seen amateur filmmakers do better work on their Macs. Like Madagascar and Shrek (both Dreamworks properties) Ice Age is a brand-name and people will see it for that reason alone. Quality doesnt come into it. Its another example of something that offers a passable diversion for kids and a restless 90 minutes for the adults who accompany them. The 3D surcharge is a rip-off the movie doesnt do anything with the effect and there are even a few instances when it appears to be improperly applied. Im sure the 2D experience isnt appreciably better but it is guaranteed to be brighter and more colorful and it wont cost as much. The best option is to ignore the existence of Dawn of the Dinosaurs altogether and see Up a second time. A repeat viewing of the Pixar film will be more rewarding than a first viewing of the latest Ice Age entry. And if youre enamored with Scrat you can wait for the DVD when judicious use of the fast-forward button will cut out the extraneous 80 minutes during which he does not appear.

With appreciably greater emphasis on action than its predecessors and clever use of 3-D trickery to enhance storytelling as well as offer spectacle ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" could prove the third time really is the charm by expanding an already sizable audience for a popular toon franchise. Fox may have taken a risk by positioning this latest series entry in the middle of summer season -- both ""Ice Age"" (2002) and ""Ice Age The Meltdown"" (2006) were March releases -- but the gamble should pay off with beaucoup cold cash. Even more bountiful green will be harvested in ancillary outlets. Once again the plot is propelled by the extended family led by Manny (voiced by Ray Romano) the lovably neurotic woolly mammoth who looms large in an Ice Age environment that in this latest adventure appears to have recovered nicely from the ""Meltdown"" of the previous pic. This time out Manny is so busy attending to Ellie (Queen Latifah) his very pregnant mate that he lacks sufficient time and energy to deal with the personal crises of two other returning ""herd"" members Diego (Denis Leary) the saber-toothed tiger who now fears hes losing his edge after being domesticated; and Sid (John Leguizamo) the rambunctiously goofy sloth who yearns for respect and if hes really lucky his own family ties. Eager to find someone anyone wholl look up to him Sid adopts three baby dinosaurs hatched from eggs hes found. Trouble is those eggs were the spawn of an enormous Mommy Dino who emerges from her stomping grounds -- an underground realm where supposedly extinct creatures are alive and well -- to retrieve her offspring. She also takes Sid back down with her causing Manny Ellie Diego and Ellies two precocious possum ""brothers"" -- Eddie (Josh Peck) and Crash (Seann William Scott) -- to follow. Once the familiar characters are below ground traipsing across a prehistoric landscape that appears equal parts ""The Lost World"" ""King Kong"" and ""The Land Before Time"" director Carlos Saldanha (returning from ""The Meltdown"") adds another colorful figure to the franchises steadily expanding cast of characters Buck a swashbuckling weasel voiced with aptly madcap brio by Simon Pegg. Long locked in an ongoing life-or-death struggle with a humongous albino dinosaur Buck is more than just a tad mad. But that makes him all the more fun to watch during a series of exciting search-and-rescue sequences that are every bit as exciting as anything in any live-action pic on view in megaplexes this summer. Indeed a high-flying encounter with rampaging pterodactyls might make the makers of ""Star Trek"" and ""Wolverine"" turn green with envy. Even during those stretches where the pace isnt breakneck and the escapes arent hairsbreadth ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" impresses with vibrant CGI imagery and animation by the wizards at Blue Sky Studios. The addition of 3-D adds even more depth and detail to the mix along with allowing the aud to enjoy the amusing illusion of snouts paw claws and beaks extending off the screen. As was the case in the two earlier ""Ice Age"" toons the vocal casting is excellent across the board. Romano and Leary are again standouts with their individual styles of sarcasm but other returnees -- including executive producer Chris Wedge as Scrat the hyperactive rat/squirrel who this time finds something even more attractive than that elusive acorn -- also are up to their usual high level. Unlike many other contempo toons ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" is short on jokey pop-culture references aimed at grown-ups more than than small fry. But there is at least one funny allusion to ""The Flintstones"" and playful use of the old Lou Rawls standard ""Youll Never Find Another Love Like Mine"" as everything from tango to comic counterpoint.
