"Costner Got `Game - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movies.Costner Got `GameOnce Again Kevin Costner Takes To The Field As A Convincing Athlete -but `For Love Of The Game Strikes Out As A Sensitive And Romantic Baseball PictureSeptember 17 1999|By Michael Wilmington Tribune Movie Critic.Kevin Costner is one movie star who really looks and acts like a top athlete. And that loose limber killer-concentration persona gives him a real edge in ""For Love of the Game"" where hes supposed to be playing a 40-year-old baseball pitcher certain to be inducted into the Hall of Fame who has one last great game in him.Not just any Hall of Fame pitcher but a guy about to pile legend on legend an aging superstar who after a mediocre 8-11 season in what may be the last outing of his career -- with his team up for sale and himself on the trading block -- suddenly gets a shot at a perfect game. (For non-baseball fans A perfect game is a rarity one in which the opposing team gets no hits and all its batters are retired -- 27 up 27 down -- with nobody reaching first base.)Not just any old perfect game either but a pitchers masterpiece in Yankee Stadium against the division-leading Yankees and their cocky crowd with announcer Vin Scully (who also was there for Don Larsens 1956 World Series perfecto) calling a sensitive play-by-play in the booth.Playing Detroit Tigers ace Billy Chapel Costner is all you could want for this role. He looks swaggers and even throws like a star pitcher. He has that special relaxation that laser glare. And he even shows us a particular type of pitcher a one-time flame-thrower who -- after losing speed and suffering a near career-ending accident -- got smart and savvy and began winning on mental toughness. A Nolan Ryan who turned into a Gaylord Perry (without the spitball).Costner like Steve McQueen before him is supremely convincing as an athlete -- almost any kind. This is his third baseball movie (after ""Bull Durham"" and ""Field of Dreams"") and I believed him -- as long as he was pitching.But I didnt believe the movie. ""For Love of the Game"" as a whole is no dream game -- unless we dont mind continually cutting away from the field action to follow Billys somewhat cliched love life. In between outs we see his volatile affair with smart young womens magazine writer Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston) a single mom and an intellectual who meets Billy after a car breakdown but is uninterested in baseball and suspicious of him. So volatile is their amour that she picks the very day of his big game to break up with him and announce that shes taking a magazine job in London.Gradually as Billy calmly mows down the Yankee lineup as Billy and his faithful slob of a catcher Gus Sinski hold destiny in their mitts we also see how Billys life has gone sour how the Tigers owner (Brian Cox) is being forced to sell the team how Billys career nearly ended when he accidentally chopped up his hand -- and how the romance of his life may be collapsing as thoroughly as the Yankee lineup.""For Love of the Game"" may be something new in sports movies a ""sensitive and romantic"" baseball picture. With its heart on its sleeve and its eye on the outside corner this is a movie that tries to have it both ways show us a spell-binding sports contest while digging down to the star athletes hopes fears and great loves.Its not surprising that Costner is the star here that hes playing a pitcher at twilight beating the best while his heart breaks and his world crumbles. Who else but Costner would take on a project like this -- after ""Bull Durham"" ""Tin Cup"" and any number of other pictures that tried to show the tender side of sports? We may wonder why bloody horror expert Sam Raimi (of ""Darkman"" and the ""Evil Dead"" movies) is directing here -- even if he is a baseball-lover coming after the most realistic and best-reviewed film of his career the compassionate thriller ""A Simple Plan."" Or why Dana Stevens -- of the sappy moderately unsuccessful ""Wings of Desire"" remake ""City of Angels"" -- is doing the script.Watching ""For Love of the Game"" I began to wonder how much we really need ""sensitive and romantic"" baseball pictures. Or at least movies like this one -- where the baseball action is entertaining but too sparingly shown -- and the romance is almost completely phony and takes up too much of the movie. (In fairness to Costner he has complained about the way Universal cut this picture trimming love scenes/nudity to get a PG-13 MPAA rating.) ""For Love of the Game"" for all its physical realism is really no improvement in many ways over the old schmaltzy baseball epics or bios like ""The Winning Team.""Like them much of this movie seems a crock. And what it bobbles is less the sports than the romance. We can accept a little kitsch in the baseball scenes. Since this is a movie we know the perfect game is probably going down to the last out and that Billy will begin to get tired and arm-sore -- and that plots and counterplots will interweave along the way.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesPerfect time for near perfectionSeptember 24 2003`Call Me MooseMay 21 2000Passing some time with the National pastimeJuly 8 2001The Dream Legacy Of Billy MartinDecember 31 1989Find More Stories AboutYankee StadiumPerfect GameTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-09-17/entertainment/9909170114_1_jane-aubrey-perfect-game-billy-chapel,200,forloveofthegame0,forloveofthegame,chicagotribune
"For Love of the Game (PG-13) Related Item ""For Love of the Game"" showtimes Costners Mild Pitch By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 17 1999 Kevin Costner goes to the well one too many times with ""For Love of the Game."" (Universal) Director Sam Raimi Cast Kevin Costner; Kelly Preston; Jena Malone; Richard T. Jones Running Time 2 hours Sexual situations and strong language Here are two things that definitely dont go together baseball and piano music. Yet these disparate elements of the universe are mixed in the new Kevin Costner film ""For Love of the Game"" in which an aging righty hurls his way ever closer to the mythic perfecto while reflecting upon his romantic past and resolving to become a better more expressive fellow. Whenever Costner rears back and uncorks a high hard one the movie at least has some life. It was filmed in the real Yankee Stadium with authentic human beings whove been paid to curse scream spit and yap. They look just like the real thing only nicer. The other players on the field appear to have some familiarity with that little white object called the ball. And Costners a good-enough athlete that he doesnt throw like Ronald - or for that matter Nancy - Reagan. He coils he winds the leg rises the shoulders snap the arm whips and the ball whistles plateward. Inconsistent release point but still thats him the real guy. He can throw. He got game. But do we really want to see this fine fellow this hearty specimen of American manhood - who is touted to be at the Ripken-Clemens level of success and celebrity - standing in the rain outside a womans house sniffling pitifully because girlfriend is entertaining another fellow in her well-lit upstairs boudoir? I may be wrong about this but I think not. Certainly Costners Billy Chapel has nothing of the personality or circumstances we might think of as a professional athletes in the ESPNified 90s. He could be Dink himself of ""Dink Stover at Yale""; noble selfless wise unconcerned with money lacking (it seems) an agent an entourage a stable of Annies. When girlfriend Jane Aubreys daughter runs away Billy diverts the team bus to pick her up and bring her back on the team charter. The stadium announcer would introduce him like this ""Pitching right-handed 11 and 16 ERA 3.23 Lancelot Sir a verray parfit gentil knyght."" The baseball half of the story just slightly works. Billy the savvy veteran wholl never see the bright side of 40 again is nearing the end of the season with a losing record on a team (Detroits Tigers) that isnt making the playoffs. Hes got issues - the girlfriend thing a catcher who not only isnt hitting but wears crummy clothes the fact that the teams about to be sold and hell be traded for prospects a thumb that was almost sawed off a sore shoulder and incidentally the New York Yankees who would like to paste him back to the low minors. But hes still got heat. I would have settled for a six-hit 4-3 complete game. A shutout okay. Youre stretching it with a no-hitter. But when you go to that rarest of all birds the perfect game the movie just gets absurd. Still because the director Sam Raimi clearly knows and loves the game he does get you into it and you feel your heart thumping as the outs accumulate and the triple goose-eggs hang there on the scoreboard growing ever heavier. Still the movies not really about baseball but about feelings - exchange baseball for hairdressing and Barbra Streisand could have starred. Thats where the piano music comes up like thunder that soggy soapy stuff that drives its cheap melodrama into your heart like a nine-inch nail. Ugh please I gag. Nothing in this half of the film works. In fact it goes so far as to become downright annoying. Couldnt the screenwriters (working from a novel by Michael Shaara) have come up with a worthier woman for this aging champion? Kelly Prestons Jane besides being New Yorks most fabulously successful freelance writer (what a house she lives in) wears black goes to gallery openings with men who speak in British accents and is amazed to discover that in baseball ""they count everything."" Its not merely that Preston is a one-dimensional actress and that her peculiar form of attractiveness is a generic beauty that seems neither sexual nor idealized and is so forgettable that her face vanishes from memory even as youre looking at it. Its that hes so passive and shes so abrasive that the coupling never makes sense. He seems more like a therapy washout than a ballplayer. Hes no longer the tough gritty sly Crash Davis of ""Bull Durham"" but some kind of moony stalker (he keeps showing up uninvited). Surely we know intuitively that an athlete at this level has been the coolest guy in his class since the age of 8. Hes moved in elite circles he hasnt heard the word ""no"" in 30 years and hes got Midass money and a movie stars sex appeal. Plus unlike Nolan Ryan hes still got hair and a Hummer. Its inconceivable that hed be as insecure and groping and grasping as this prideless self-doubting nebbish. Hes a nerd. He could never play for the Durham Bulls - hes not tough enough.

With Kevin Costner Kelly Preston John C. Reilly Jena Malone Brian Cox. Directed by Sam Raimi. Running time 134 mins. Area theaters. Rated PG-13 Language adult situations. 2 1/2 STARS The baseball sequences in Sam Raimis ""For Love of the Game"" whose title might as well include the words ""And a Girl Named Jane"" are so well conceived choreographed shot and edited it could do without any kind of love story let alone the one it got. But ""For Love of the Game"" stars the post-""Waterworld"" post-""Postman"" post-humiliation Kevin Costner and he knows better than to try to carry a movie without a love interest. Thus the films hero Billy Chapel a future Hall of Fame pitcher assessing his past and his future while attempting to pitch a perfect game picks up a girlfriend along the way. Literally picks her up. Jane (Kelly Preston) is a single mom and magazine writer stranded on the shoulder of a busy New York parkway when Billy happens by restarts her engine treats her to a game and dinner then restarts her engine again if you get my drift. ""How do you like to be kissed?"" Billy asks dropping a field-tested line from ""Bull Durham."" Jane is so aroused by the possibilities she has to write her answer on a piece of paper and hold it up to him ""Yes."" Since Billy actually plays for the Detroit Tigers and only gets to the Big Apple a couple of times a year and since Jane is petrified of being regarded as a groupie she becomes the dream groupie He can have her whenever hes in town she tells him; the rest of the time theyll both follow a dont-ask/dont-tell policy. Fellow travelers does it get any better than this? But back to the game. Its at Yankee Stadium where Billy and the Tigers hope to salvage something from a bad season by beating the playoff-bound Yankees. Billy a Nolan Ryan-like figure is at the end of his 19th season with the Tigers and taking the mound on the insider news that the team is being sold and hell be traded. How cool would it be to pitch a great game maybe the game of his life and go out as a Tiger on top? As Billys resurgent arm begins mowing down the Yanks (with a feeble fictional lineup) its suddenly possible. But itll be tough to concentrate with all those flashbacks The baseball sequences are fabulous not least because Costner looks and moves like a real player a rarity for actors in sports movies. But Raimi has a few ideas of his own. The ex-horrormeister (""The Evil Dead"" ""Darkman"") proved with the tongue-in-cheek Western ""The Quick and the Dead"" and the sharply drawn thriller ""A Simple Plan"" that hes no one-genre wonder. The former Detroiter has a genuine eye for composition specifically when isolating people in crowds and he puts that to perfect use in ""Love."" He turns the mound into a throne with Chapel its king. Images of the pitcher staring down the batter as the stadium and the crowd noise fade into oblivion are stunning. A LeRoy Neiman knockoff cant be far behind. But the love story a five-year off-and-on affair is little more than a sop to Costners romantic faithful. I dont begrudge them fantasies not in a baseball film that satisfies oneof mine. But the film makers could have done better than hang the suspense of their relationship on Janes lament ""You dont need me all you need is the game."" Let her go Billy and bear down.

His failure to reach those heights again isnt just a matter of matching an impossible standard. For Love of the Game hardly comes across as an accurate reflection of the state of play in baseball or public attitudes toward the sport that has long since lost its primacy as the national pastime.Costner clearly loves baseball and yearns for the days when its unblemished stars could become icons. But widely reported greed has long since overwhelmed the owners and the athletes and the sardonic coverage epitomized by ESPN - not to mention raucous comedies like Major League - makes myth-making a difficult task.Costners Billy Chapel on the downside of a brilliant 19-year pitching career with the Detroit Tigers takes glum note of these changes. For Love of the Game tries to forge a drama out of a man who rises above them. When the teams owner decides to sell out to a corporation and trade Chapel to the Giants he observes ""Everythings changed Billy. The game. The players."" And he is of course right.When For Love of the Game stays within the white lines of the baseball diamond at Yankee Stadium with Chapel making a bid for valedictory perfection it is a polished and enjoyable piece of filmmaking. Its sense of the games rhythms and nuances and what its like down on the field is exceptional. The incomparable Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully calls the play and adds to the authenticity.Sam Raimi the cult horror director who entered the mainstream with the dazzling A Simple Plan handles jock camaraderie and macho hostility with flair and confidence. But his movie strays out into left field when the theme turns to love rather than love of the game.As Billy pitches against the formidable Yankees lineup his story unfolds in a series of flashbacks over the previous five years. These concentrate on his relationship with Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston) a freelance journalist.On the field Costner is consistent but his exploration of Billys romantic dilemma is superficial and often wooden. Part of that can be blamed on a screenplay that has an unerring taste for the pat banality as when Jane tells our hero ""You dont need me. You and the ball and the diamond are perfect.""Anyone among the unhappy few who sat all the way through the ludicrous The Postman knows all too well that men on the brink of legend represent especially dangerous terrain for Costner. When the next baseball script in this vein comes his way he could show his love of the game by tossing the manager the ball and walking off the mound.FOR LOVE OF THE GAME   1/2 Produced by Armyan Bernstein and Amy Robinson directed by Sam Raimi written by Dana Stevens photography by John Bailey music by Basil Poledouris distributed by Universal Studios.Running time 2 hours 17 mins.Billy Chapel......Kevin CostnerJane Aubrey.......Kelly PrestonGus Sinski........John C.

"For Love of the Game (PG-13) Related Item Go to Video Finder Costner Does It Again...and Again...and Again By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 17 1999 Kevin Costner goes to the well one too many times with ""For Love of the Game."" (Universal) Director Sam Raimi Cast Kevin Costner; Kelly Preston; Jena Malone; Richard T. Jones Running Time 2 hours 18 minutes Contains sexual situations strong language and close-up shots of Yankees fans Welcome to the game show ""Stop Me if Youve Heard This One Before."" In this contest readers across the nation can hit the buzzer as soon as I outline a movie plot thats been done before. There are no cash prizes for hitting the buzzer but your disdain will be duly noted. Lets start with ""For Love of the Game"" a new sports movie starring Kevin Costner as a baseball player who - BZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Oooh arent we on top of our game? That reader is correct. We have seen Costner as a baseball player before in ""Field of Dreams"" and ""Bull Durham."" There was also ""Tin Cup"" in which Costner pushed the envelope and played a golfer. So technically that doesnt count. Okay lets keep going with ""For Love of the Game"" in which Costner plays Billy Chapel a veteran pitcher for the Detroit Tigers who is facing the end of his career - BZZZZZZZT BZZZZZZZT BZZZZZZZT Whoa easy there One at a time please. Yes you are all right. Costner is always playing someone facing the end of his career including that golfing flick. BZZZZZZZT Hmmm another buzz. This reader claims that Costner was also in the movie ""White Guys Cant Jump."" No that is incorrect. But your instincts were right. Ron Shelton who directed Costner in ""Bull Durham"" and ""Tin Cup"" asked Costner to be the star of the basketball movie. But his schedule didnt permit it so Woody Harrelson took the part. Wow you guys are really on the ball. Okay lets keep going. ""For Love of the Game"" co-stars Kelly Preston as Jane Aubrey a single mother who comes into his life makes demands on his time and - BZZZZZZZT BZZZZZZZT Yes correct again. The first reader tells me that yes Costner always seems to run into a woman who makes relationship demands on his time. Its always the woman or the sport. And the second reader whats your comment? Okay thats valid. The second reader says this whole single-mom thing was started in that other sports movie not starring Kevin Costner ""Jerry Maguire"" in which Tom Cruise falls in love with single mom Renee Zellweger. In the movie Jane is gorgeous of course. Shes everything a guy could want - between sports events I mean. But she starts to crowd his space encroach upon his guyness with all those relationship issues. She wants to talk about everything. He doesnt - BZZZZZZZT Yes correct. Thats the stuff of every romantic film since ""Adams Rib."" He said she said. Or maybe she said he grunted. Real guys dont talk about it. Real guys struggle to find the right words because theyre obsessed with the game to the exclusion of everything else - Yes correct. Costner is always an obsessive sportsman a players player. This is a cheap plot to get the guys in his favor before he launches into the romantic part of the movie. Okay weve run out of time. I think weve established that Costner is guilty of repeating three-peating and four-peating himself. Now its time for the Jerry Springer ""Final Thought"" part of the review. What I enjoyed about the movie is that mounting tension between pitcher and batter as they lock psychological horns. Billy Chapel who learns the Tigers are about to be sold - and his contract along with them - tries to throw the biggest game of his life against the New York Yankees. And as he stands on the loneliest spot on earth - the pitchers mound at Yankee Stadium - hell mutter something caustic. The batter will mutter something too. And catcher Gus Sinski (John C. Reilly) will do the finger dance. Great stuff. When its time to actually pitch the ball (an eternity precedes it) Billy winds up that aching aging arm and says to himself ""Clear the mechanism."" Suddenly all the obnoxious badmouthing from the stands becomes dead silent. And he throws. The rest is hardly worth mentioning unfortunately. Once again Costner goes into shy-stud mode as he charms Jane upon first meeting. You know what Im talking about. Deep thoughts wrack his brow but hes too male to say it good. But this is a two-hour movie. Hes got all the time in the world to play nine innings and reunite with his estranged girlfriend who - at the beginning of this flashback-crazy film - tells him shes outta here heading to London goodbye. Those flashbacks will drive you nuts. As if baseball didnt drag on long enough almost every inning or out of that Yankees game is punctuated by a memory. Most of them concern Billys five-year relationship with Jane and theyre all tinged with that shimmery Christmas lighting because its The Past. But no matter how many flashbacks we see there are basically two questions hanging over the movie. Will that arm keep working? And will these on-again-off-again lovers finally - BZZZZZZZT (c) Copyright 1999 The Washington Post Company Back to the top",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/forloveofthegamehowe.htm,200,forloveofthegame4,forloveofthegame,washingtonpost

Directed by Sam Raimi. Running time 140 minutes. Rating PG-13. At Sony Lincoln Square Loews Kips Bay UA Criterion others. FOR Love of the Game"" is another two-hours-plus Kevin Costner strikeout a gassy baseball elegy suffocating in Lite-Rock schmoopiness and Costnerian self-regard. Its ""The Postman"" on a pitchers mound. For love of the God what is wrong with the once-likable Kevin Costner? Costners been in a slump the past few years so its not surprising that he would try to jump-start things with a third trip to the diamond (""Bull Durham"" and ""Field of Dreams"" being career high points for the actor). Unfortunately the flabby ""Game"" script adapted by Dana Stevens from Michael Shaaras novel plays to Costners worst instincts. Here he is the epic hero once again manfully bearing the weight of the world on his noble shoulders without the consolation of say a sense of humor. If you want an Ingmar Bergman-style yuppie baseball movie look no further. This time out Costner is ace Detroit Tigers pitcher Billy Chapel 40 years old and at the twilight of a brilliant career. His arms giving out hes about to be traded by the teams new corporate owners and his girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) has left him. With all this hanging over his head ""Chappy"" must take the mound at Yankee Stadium to throw what he knows may be the last game of his life. ""Billy youve been the heart and soul of this team"" someone says in the first of the movies many Metaphor Alerts. By the end game announcer Vin Scully is klaxoning ""Hes pitching against time hes pitching against the future hes pitching against his own mortality"" ""For Love of the Game"" is structured as a series of flashbacks on Billys five-year relationship with Jane. As the game progresses we learn how the two met how their relationship developed and how it went downhill. Jane is a New York magazine journalist with a palpable wariness about men. They to-and-fro between crises and cuddling but theres no drama or dynamism to their romance. Handsome Costner is gruff and inexpressive and Meg Ryan wannabe Preston has the personality of flat Zima. While struggling to keep an incredible no-hitter going Billy reflects on what hes lost with Jane whos headed to a new job and life in London and why. Could it be that the love of a good woman is more important even than baseball? Given the thoroughgoing shmaltziness of Dana Stevens screenplay could it be anything else? Costner vain diva that he is has whined publicly about the cuts Universal imposed on the 140-minute film - they even nipped out an image of Kevvos wing-wang Clearly this was a mercy killing.

The Game Of Love - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Kevin Costner The Game Of LoveMOVIES - MOVIE REVIEWKevin Costner Portrays A Baseball Pitcher In A Soap Opera Disguised As A Baseball MovieSeptember 17 1999For the true-blue baseball fan going to see the new Kevin Costner movie could be rather jarring.Its a little like settling down in front of the set to watch your favorite team only to discover that the broadcast has been pre-empted for an episode of Days of Our Lives.Yes For Love of the Game does seem to be about the Game. But really its about Love. The world of baseball is only the setting for what turns out to be a big-screen soap opera.The lives whose days were watching are those of Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) and Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston).For 19 years Billy has been with the Detroit Tigers where he has been the clubs star pitcher as well as its ``heart and soul. Jane meanwhile is a single-mom New Yorker and a fashion writer.Early in the film the 40-year-old pitcher gets bad newsThe Tigers are planning to trade him. And as if that were not bad enough Jane suddenly announces that she is moving to London.Having barely absorbed this stunning information Billy makes his way to Yankee Stadium to pitch what it turns out could be a perfect game (in which no opposing batter gets to first base). Most of the rest of the movie takes place during that game with frequent flashbacks to fill us in on Billys career and the couples up-and-down relationship.Even though Ive called this film a soap opera I really should add that there is a lot to recommend For Love of the Game which is based on the novel by Michael Shaara.Costner whose admirable record with baseball movies (Bull Durham Field of Dreams) is hard to dispute gives an affecting dignified performance in the role of Billy.As Billy pitches in the big game he talks to himself about the other players and life in general more-or-less introducing the flashbacks. This device easily could have become awkward but Costner carries it off effortlessly.Hes also convincing when hes called upon to demonstrate that his character has a boiling point.Billys frustration and at times even anger help to ground the pitcher - and the picture - in reality. And when he goes into a slump Costners body language tells us that he knows what its like to be counted out.But in general and despite Billys quasi-narration we see the events of the film through the eyes of Jane. Thats part of what I mean when I say that the film is a soap opera.Jane isnt much of a baseball fan except through her relationship with Billy. Her focus is always their romance and that is the films major focus too.Im all for romance you understand. But what makes this a drawback is that these people are all wrong for each other and that the filmmakers dont seem to know it.Their physical relationship aside what do Billy and Jane see in each other anyway? Billy shows some fatherly concern for Janes adolescent daughter (Jena Malone) but he has no apparent interest in the womans job and only contempt for her friends.Jane meanwhile neither shares Billys passion for baseball nor understands the sacrifices that sports stardom demands from him.Its obvious that Jane is intended to come off as an intelligent woman of great depth. But when you really think about the basis of their relationship she seems like just another groupie attracted to a cute famous guy.Prestons one-note TV-actress performance is part of the problem but only part. The real problem is in the script.It never seems to have dawned on screenwriter Dana Stevens (City of Angels) that Billy is exactly the wrong kind of guy for a gal like Jane who surely would have been much happier with a nice stable dentist or tax accountant.That this miscalculation doesnt sink the picture (which opens today) is a tribute to Cost- ners performance and to the films sneaky wit.Helping out in this department is John C. Reilly (Boogie Nights) as Billys best buddy and the Tiger catcher. Upon hearing that the pitcher has just lost both his job and his girl- friend the catcher pauses a beat.``Billy he offers with hilarious understatement ``this aint your day.Director Sam Raimi who is best known for flashy flicks like The Evil Dead takes things easy. He allows the story to set its own tempo and doesnt go in for distracting trick shots.In fact the film might have completely triumphed over its weaknesses if the baseball sections had better demonstrated Billys love of the game his joy in its physicality. What we see instead is his love of winning which isnt quite the same thing.But if For Love of the Game doesnt turn out to play a perfect game it nevertheless puts some points on the scoreboard. Whether or not it scores highly enough to win in Hollywood terms is a question that only the box-office figures can answer.

"A Good Year for the Roses? Slate Sign In Sign Up A Good Year for the Roses? A Good Year for the Roses? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 18 1999 330 AM A Good Year for the Roses? American Beauty is blooming but rank; For Love of the Game is overripe. By David Edelstein American Beauty Directed by Sam Mendes DreamWorks SKG For Love of the Game Directed by Sam Raimi Universal Pictures Early in American Beauty Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) a weary reporter for a media magazine masturbates in the shower while informing us in voice-over that were witnessing the highlight of his day. He peers through tired eyes out the window at his manicured suburban tract-house lawn where his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening)--whose gardening clogs he points out are color-coordinated with the handles of her shears--snips roses (American beauties) and twitters about Miracle-Gro to a gay yuppie (Scott Bakula) on the other side of a white picket fence. ""I have lost something"" says Lester. ""Im not exactly sure what it is but I know I didnt always feel this ... sedated."" Apparently Lester doesnt realize that snipped roses are garden-variety symbols of castration or hed know what he has lost. But the makers of American Beauty are about to give Lester his roses back. At a high-school basketball game Lester is transfixed by a blonde cheerleader named Angela (Mena Suvari) who is twirling alongside his daughter Jane (Thora Burch). Ambient noise falls away the crowd disappears and there she is Lesters angel writhing in slow motion--just for him. She opens her jacket (shes naked underneath) and red rose petals drift out. Later Lester envisions her on a bed of red petals then immersed in a bath of red petals. Back in the roses for the first time in years hes soon pumping iron smoking pot and telling off his frigid wife and faceless bosses convinced that whatever he has lost hes getting back baby. Advertisement The movie is convinced too--which is odd since the fantasy of an underage cheerleader making a middle-aged mans wilted roses bloom is a tad ... primitive. But American Beauty doesnt feel primitive. It feels lustrously hip and aware and a lot of critics are making big claims for it. The script by Alan Ball a playwright and former sitcom writer carries an invigorating blast of counterculture righteousness along with the kind of pithily vicious marital bickering that makes some viewers (especially male) say ""Yeah Tell that bitch off"" More important it has a vein of metaphysical yearning which the director Sam Mendes mines brilliantly. A hotshot English theater director (his Cabaret revival is still on the boards in New York) Mendes gives the film a patina of New Age lyricism and layer upon layer of visual irony. The movies surface is velvety and immaculate--until the action is abruptly viewed through the video camera of the teen-age voyeur next door (Wes Bentley) and the graininess of the video image (along with the plangent music) suggests how unstable the molecules that constitute our ""reality"" really are. Mendes can distend the real into the surreal with imperceptible puffs. Aided by his cinematographer Conrad Hall and editors Tariq Anwar and Chris Greenbury he creates an entrancing vision of the American nuclear family on the verge of a meltdown. AmericanBeauty is so wittily written and gorgeously directed that you might think youre seeing something archetypal--maybe even the Great American Movie. But when you stop and smell the roses ... Well that scent isnt Miracle-Gro. The hairpin turns from farce to melodrama from satire to bathos are fresh and deftly navigated but almost every one of the underlying attitudes is smug and easy from the corporate flunky named ""Brad"" to the interchangeable gay neighbors (theyre both called ""Jim"") to the brutally homophobic patriarch next door an ex-Marine colonel (Chris Cooper) who has reduced his wife (the normally exuberant Allison Janney) to a catatonic mummy and his son Ricky (Bentley) to a life of subterranean deception. (The colonels idea of bliss is watching an old Ronald Reagan military picture on television Hows that for subtle?) Lesters wife Carolyn is even more stridently caricatured. A real-estate broker who fails to sell a big house (her only potential customers are blank-faced African-Americans Indian-Americans and surly lesbians) she wears a mask of perky efficiency and insists on listening to Muzak while she and her husband and daughter eat her ""nutritious yet savory"" dinners. Its amazing that Mendes and Ball get away with recycling so many stale and reactionary ideas under the all-purpose rubric of ""black comedy."" But its also possible that those ideas have rarely been presented so seductively. Several months ago Daniel Menaker in Slate identified a strain in contemporary film in which the protagonist attempts to break through our cultural and technological anesthetization into ""the real."" Thats the theme here too and its extraordinarily potent at times even heartbreaking. The symbols however have been cunningly reversed. In movies like sex lies and videotape (1989) the protagonist has to put away the video camera to ""get real""; in American Beauty its Ricky Fitts the damaged stoner videomaker next door who sees beauty where nonartists see only horror or nothingness. In the films most self-consciously poetic set piece Ricky shows Lesters dour daughter Jane--in whom he recognizes a kindred spirit--a video of a plastic bag fluttering up down and around on invisible currents of wind. Ricky speaks of glimpsing in the bags trajectory an ""entire life behind things""--a ""benevolent force"" that holds the universe together. The teen-ager who likes to train his lenses on dead bodies of animals and people sells wildly expensive marijuana to Lester and somehow passes on this notion of ""beauty."" By the end Lester is mouthing the same sentiments and has acquired the same deadpan radiance. That must be some really good shit theyre smoking. I ts not the druggy philosophizing however that makes American Beauty an emotional workout. Its that the caricatures are grounded in sympathy instead of derision. Everyone on screen is in serious pain. The manipulative sexpot Angela who taunts her friend Jane with the idea of seducing her dad acts chiefly out of a terror of appearing ordinary. As the military martinet Cooper goes against the grain turning Col. Fitts into a sour bulldog whose capaciously baggy eyes are moist with sadness over his inability to reach out. (When he stands helplessly in the rain at the end the deluge completes him.) The character of Carolyn is so shrill as to constitute a libel on the female sex but there isnt a second when Bening sends the woman up. She doesnt transcend the part she fills it to the brim anatomizes it. You cant hate Carolyn because the woman is trying so hard--to appear confident composed in control. When she fails to sell that house she closes the shades and lets go with a naked wail--its the sound of a vacuum crying to be filled--then furiously slaps herself while sputtering ""Shut up--youre weak--shut up."" Then she breathes regains her go-get-em poise replaces her mask. Carolyn isnt a complicated dramatic construction but Bening gives her a primal force. An actress who packs more psychological detail into a single gesture than others get into whole scenes Bening was barreling down the road to greatness before she hit a speed bump called Warren. Its a joy to observe her--both here and in Neil Jordans In Dreams (1999)--back at full throttle. Advertisement American Beauty is Spaceys movie though. He gives it--how weird to write this about Spacey who made his name playing flamboyantly self-involved psychopaths--a heart. Early on he lets his face and posture go slack and his eyes blurry. He mugs like crazy telegraphing Lesters ""loserness."" But Spaceys genius is for mugging in character. He makes us believe that its Lester whos caricaturing himself and that bitter edge paves the way for the characters later more comfortably Spacey-like scenes of insult and mockery. He even makes us take Lesters final improbably rhapsodic moments straight. But do the filmmakers take them straight? If I read it correctly the movie is saying that American society is unjust and absurd and loveless--full of people so afraid of seeming ordinary that they lose their capacity to see. Its saying that our only hope is to cultivate a kind of stoned aesthetic detachment whereby even a man with his brains blown out becomes an object of beauty and a signpost to a Higher Power. But to scrutinize a freshly dead body and not ask how it got that way--or if theres anyone nearby with a gun who might want to add to the body count--strikes me as either moronic or insane or both. The kind of detachment the movie is peddling isnt artistic it isnt life--its nihilism at its most fatuous. In the end American Beauty is New Age Nihilism. K evin Costner is 11 years older than he was as Crash Davis the over-the-hill minor-league catcher in Bull Durham (1988) but he can still get away with playing a professional ballplayer. He moves and acts like a celebrity jock and he can make his narcissistic self-containment look as if hes keeping something in reserve--to protect his ""instrument"" as it were. In For Love of the Game hes a 40ish Detroit Tigers pitcher having his last hurrah The team has been sold and the new owners dont necessarily want him back. For about half an hour its a great sports movie. Costner stands on the mound shaking off the signals of his longtime catcher (John C. Reilly); he forces himself to tune out the huge Yankee Stadium crowd (the background blurs before our eyes and the sound drops out); and he mutters darkly at a succession of batters some old nemeses some old buddies. He also thinks about his Manhattan-based ex-girlfriend (Kelly Preston) who tearfully told him that morning that things were absolutely over and she was moving to London. Theres an appealing flashback to how they met (he stopped to fix her car while on the way to Yankee Stadium) then its back to the game for more nail-biting at bats. But pretty soon the relationship flashbacks start coming thick and fast and the balance of the movie shifts to whether Kevin can commit to Kelly and Kelly can commit to Kevin or whether his only commitment could ever be to the ball and the diamond and the game. Maybe its because Im a baseball nut that I hated to leave the mound. But maybe its also because the relationships scenes are soft-focus generic and woozily drawn-out whereas the stuff in the stadium is sharply edited and full of texture. The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin and the picture drags on for over two hours. I cant believe that the director Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead 1983; last years A Simple Plan) thought that all those scenes of Costner and Preston staring into space while the piano plinks would end up in the final cut but Raimi apparently gave up control of the final cut for the sake of making his first real mainstream picture. He might as well have stuck his head over the plate and said ""Bean me."" SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Now the owner Mr. Wheeler (Brian Cox) is selling the team to a corporation that wants to trade Billy. Wheeler urges him to retire arguing that todays baseball stinks. ""Baseball doesnt stink"" Billy tells his boss. ""Its a great game."" Costner delivers that sappy line with real sincerity which extends to his scenes with the excellent John C. Reilly as Gus Billys longtime catcher. Out of the ballpark the story derails as Billy hooks up with Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston) a journalist raising a teenager Heather (Jena Malone) whom she had at sixteen. ""Mom never had time for a love story"" Heather tells Billy who tries to supply one. But after five years of neglect Jane splits. And - thank you Hollywood - she walks on the same day Billy steps on the mound for the last time and takes on the Yankees. As he strains for a perfect game Billys life with Jane flashes before him. Thats all folks a giant cornball flashback. Not a frame reflects the distinctively edgy touch that director Sam Raimi brought to films as diverse as The Evil Dead and A Simple Plan. Was Costner being a buttinsky? Is Hollywood in California? Game plays like an unholy union of The Natural and The Prince of Tides. Too bad. The baseball footage superbly shot at Yankee Stadium by cinematographer John Bailey (Living Out Loud) sets the scene for a fastball that never comes. Theres no heat in watching Billy pine and Jane whine. But guess what? Build a movie as a shrine to baseball and they will come. Suckers Now you can send in that hate mail.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Covering one of the few areas of culture in which men are not only allowed but encouraged to display emotion movies dealing with sports have it easy in some respects getting away with more mushy stuff than usual without alienating their core audience. For Love Of The Game stretches this cushion to the breaking point however. Directed by Sam Raimi from a novel by Michael Shaara For Love Of The Game stars baseball-movie favorite Kevin Costner as an aging Detroit Tigers pitcher who during a meaningless late-season outing begins to pitch what could be a perfect game over the course of which he reflects upon his life particularly an on-again/off-again relationship with fashion writer Kelly Preston. Its a promising setup for a movie that continually lets it down. Raimi throws all his good stuff into Loves game scenes and though the outcome of these sequences is the very definition of the word ""overdetermined"" he still makes them exciting. (Still Raimis not above throwing in sepia-toned flashbacks to scenes of Costner playing ball with his father as a child.) Elsewhere For Love Of The Game seems lost as one overlong melodramatic interlude follows another each more predictable than the entirely predictable game itself. Nearly every scene not set in a ballpark is dull and badly handled the stuff of standard romantic drama at its least inspired. Thats a shame given that Raimis marvelous A Simple Plan proved just how good he can be when stripped of the stylistic trickery of his Evil Dead films. Costner Preston and the always-enjoyable John C. Reilly are all fine but the best performance may come from veteran sportscaster Vin Scully. Though he plays himself Scully brings all the drama and urgency a good sportscaster should to a film that sorely needs it. With an air of likability about it and a handful of great moments its hard not to root for Raimis film but in the end its akin to placing your faith in a team destined to lose every time it really counts.

Are You Sitting? Costners Great Too By Rex Reed  09/20/99 1200am Whatever He Is Spaceys Damn Good American Beauty may be the best movie of the year. Certainly I have not seen anything this good in 1999 and I seriously doubt I will see anything better. It is the best way I can think of to end an old millennium and begin a new one-the kind of powerful brilliant profoundly moving and refreshingly innovative film experience the entire motion picture industry can be proud of and the kind of rare and provocative once-in-a-filmgoing-lifetime experience audiences can treasure. After a punishing summer of bogus comedies dumb action epics and brainless sex romps that only the village idiot could applaud it is certainly a gratifying way to begin the new fall season. The kids have left the mall; time for the grown-ups to take over. American Beauty is at first glance another spin on the dysfunctional American family (is there any other kind?) that might remind you of The Ice Storm  but as each layer unfolds you realize how complex and unique it is. It throbs with the tempo of a vein pulsing in the head before a stroke. Here on a maple-lined street in a perfect all-American suburb no one is what he or she appears to be; everyone is pretending to be someone else each neighbor hides an inner self behind a mask of purpose and guile and there are dark secrets in the rose gardens. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his life as Lester Burnham a 42-year-old disaster with a dull job writing pretentious advertising copy for a media magazine who is festering from a lack of affection. His wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) is a perfectly accessorized bitch paralyzed by fear frustration and sexual boredom who hides her misery in material possessions and prize American Beauty roses. Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is an angry confused teenager who hates her parents and feels ugly and isolated in her own home. On one side the neighbors are two gay lovers (Scott Bakula and Sam Robards) who are both named Jim; on the other side a Marine Corps colonel (Chris Cooper) with the most dangerous secret of all his zombie wife (Allison Janney) and their weird son Ricky (an astonishing performance by newcomer Wes Bentley) who behind the guise of a handsome all-American heartthrob deals drugs. Lester fantasizes about his daughters best friend (Mena Suvari) a seductive Lolita whose frank sexuality is really a cover-up for a deep emotional insecurity. Carolyn launches an extramarital affair with a flashy realtor (Peter Gallagher) and finds new power in target practice at a rifle range. Ricky films the whole neighborhood on his camcorder. Nobody has the courage to declare war on this constipated world of phony moral absolutes long enough to face the truth except Lester who starts working on his abs and smoking pot quits his job blackmails his boss for a hefty retirement package and stages a one-man rebellion that wrecks the manicured order and pretense of everyone around him. Meanwhile the sinister Marine colonel who collects Nazi dinnerware from the Third Reich in the same display case that houses his military assault weapons moves closer and closer to madness in a film already infected with a creeping empty lethargy of its own. Here is a cesspool-like microcosm of the American dream a rich and privileged suburb with a lot of disturbed people and one genuine psycho with the power to bring their ghastly world crashing down around their pointed little heads in one act of senseless violence as redemptive as it is electrifying. It is just one of the ironies in the shattering screenplay by first-time feature film writer Alan Ball that a film this disturbing can also be so funny. American Beauty is the most scalding appraisal of screwed-up American values I have seen in years yet I found myself laughing out loud at its sharp and biting sense of humor. The characters are so well dissected their foibles and peculiarities so accurately observed that they remain human even in their most absurd moments. The film is also a miraculous directorial debut for British Wunderkind Sam Mendes the celebrated whiz kid responsible for the London and Broadway revivals of Cabaret . His cunning eye for nuance is so self-assured its difficult to believe he hasnt been directing movies all of his life. Include the meticulous camerawork of the great Conrad Hall and you have the perfect recipe for a demanding and unusual film of surprises and revelations in every scene. The entire cast is uniformly inspired but it is Mr. Spacey who hypnotizes. Starting off as an oafish Dagwood Bumstead he gets laughs but builds confidently as his character grows and changes. After every attempt to be a caring father and loving husband is rebuffed Lester loses his blank deadpan doofus look and turns into a raving self-satisfied Lothario but even while hes making you laugh hes breaking your heart. In his transformation he finds nobility too late but its one of the most stunning portraits of a loser with dignity ever filmed. Dont be surprised if he doesnt cop a second Academy Award for this remarkable achievement. American Beauty is a film of such dramatic contrasts that its difficult to do justice to its importance in this enthusiastic but brief appraisal. Its a film of such rich complexity maturity revelation subtlety and paradox that you just have to experience it for yourself. Youll leave it dazed and thoughtful ready to re-examine your own life and you wont forget it easily. Movies just dont get any better than this. Are You Sitting? Costners Great Too More intelligence and integrity are on view (is this a trend?) in For Love of the Game . Yes its another Kevin Costner baseball picture but dont run in the opposite direction just yet. Its surprisingly sensitive extremely polished and not quite what youd expect. And the star is really (you better sit down for this next part) quite wonderful in it. Under the confident direction of Sam ( A Simple Plan ) Raimi Mr. Costner gives a restrained but emotionally accessible performance as Billy Chapel a celebrated pitcher with the Detroit Tigers who after a 20-year career in baseball is facing the greatest challenge of his life on and off the field. Hes tired hes facing retirement hes got a bad shoulder and constant pain from a near-fatal hand injury the game has changed the players and colleagues with whom he grew have died or moved on and now hes up against personal problems as well. Not only is he being traded to a new ball club but his girl Jane the love of his life for the past five years and the only woman hes ever treated as more than a baseball groupie is leaving him for a new job and a different life in London. Now in the final game of the season against the New York Yankees the game that will determine who wins the pennant Billy is forced to re-examine his priorities. While he stands out there in the middle of Yankee Stadium with 56000 screaming fans watching every nerve in his face he cracks his knuckles and watches the clouds move while the pieces of his life play across his mind like an old movie. For the first time in his years of major league baseball he realizes he has sacrificed everything for the game. Will he pitch the winning ball in the final inning? Does he learn the trappings of fame are empty without someone you love with whom to share them? Can he extend his career with a new manager and a new team in the twilight of his talent or will he throw in the towel for personal happiness? Its the stuff of a menopausal-male soap opera but so skillfully handled and sincerely played you cant help but like the guy. And Mr. Costner too. The action scenes on the diamond are exciting and well paced but its the personal side of an athletes life that holds the action here. Kelly Preston does a fine job as Jane the fashion writer with a troubled teenage daughter to raise alone who teaches Billy to love and trust while always being forced to play second to his obsession with the game. The film is most engaging when it chronicles their passionate but stormy relationship developing from casual encounter to intense codependence while his career rises and fumbles and her doubts grow. Ms. Preston has an unhackneyed naturalism for which the camera has an obvious fondness and her warmth and honesty have a melting effect on Mr. Costners trademark sullenness. The chemistry brings out an unfamiliar softness in his performance that is downright appealing. By the final reel he actually seems to be living his role with real conviction. Cynics will feel manipulated but I havent seen a good mushy baseball movie since The Stratton Story . Mr. Costner is no Jimmy Stewart but he cries almost as much as June Allyson. After Waterworld  The Postman and all the other gruesome pretentious bombs hes forced the rest of us to endure its nice for a change to watch him suffer.

Comments For Love of the Game Near the end of his career star pitcher Kevin Costner hurls a masterpiece while reviewing his life. Among the things he has to think about are Kelly Preston as the woman he loves and is losing Jena Malone as her teenage daughter and the serious hand injury hes had to come back from. I cant imagine what baseball fans will make of this protracted tearjerker and its tortured flashback structure but fans of director Sam Raimi who welcomed his recent impulses to diversify (The Quick and the Dead A Simple Plan) after making his name as a horror specialist may have second thoughts. The actual culprit may be Costner so bent on giving himself maximum screen time that I doubt even Carl Dreyer could have made much of the results though Im told that Universal reedited Costners version after he reedited Raimis. For the first 100 minutes or so I found this hokey but serviceable; after that my watch became more meaningful than anything I could locate on-screen. Adapted by Dana Stevens from a novel by Michael Shaara; with John C. Reilly and Brian Cox.

Baseball fans will think theyre in heaven A pic has finally nailed the actual playing of the Grand Old Game with remarkable realism. As all-American and all-Hollywood as a movie can get in the late 90s ""For Love of the Game"" represents a modest personal comeback for star Kevin Costner in the best combo of his strengths as romantic lead and athletic guy since Ron Sheltons ""Tin Cup."" This marks a kind of capper on Costners baseball trilogy from the minor leagues of ""Bull Durham"" to the fantasy of ""Field of Dreams"" to this highly uneven study of an aging vet in his swan-song game in the bigs. Baseball fans will think theyre in heaven A pic has finally nailed the actual playing of the Grand Old Game with remarkable realism while fans of helmer Sam Raimi will be in shock at the ramrod-straight style and storytelling. While incurring stars public wrath at trimming scenes (for both length and to obtain PG-13 rating claims Costner) Universal is opening pic at baseballs seasonal primetime and should pull in both sports-addicted males and women looking for a semi-mature love story. B.O. RBI are going to be mostly Stateside with little interest in non-baseball territories -- which is most of the planet. Few genres have consistently landed in the cellar as often as baseball movies and no pic -- other than ""Bull Durham"" -- has captured the absurdly funny nature and characters of the sport. ""For Love of the Game"" ignores the games grit and eccentricities in favor of a mood of valedictory romance both for the game and for its lead characters and this choice will surely turn off sports-fan moviegoers who favor the ribald Shelton approach. Though hiring of baseball fan Raimi proves crucial in his intensely physical approach to visualizing the game -- particularly in staging and framing of major-league-quality fastballs and curveballs a first in movie history -- pics overly conservative and ultra-serious manner has the fingerprints of Costner (whose Tig Prods. was a co-producer) all over it. Not only fans of the game will note that pics game sequences far overwhelm its off-the-field love yarn. Pic grabs nostalgic heartstrings instantly with an elegiac title-seg montage blending home movies and graphics of young Michigan little leaguer Billy Chapel growing up and making it to the majors with the Detroit Tigers. Per many superstar throwers Chapel (Costner) has his own designated catcher in Gus Sinski (John C. Reilly). Sinskis against manager Frank Perrys (J.K. Simmons) decision to pitch Chapel against the contending New York Yankees in Yankee Stadium -- especially since the last-place Tigers season is over -- but Chapels life soon gives him motivation. In a set of contrived and unconvincingly compacted plot moves which scribe Dana Stevens took faithfully from Michael Shaaras brief posthumously published novel Chapel is stood up by his g.f. fashion mag columnist Jane (Kelly Preston) and informed by Tigers owner Gary Wheeler (Brian Cox) that hes selling the club to a corporate group whose first plan is to trade Chapel to the San Francisco Giants. The knife is twisted further as he meets morose Jane in Central Park and learns shes moving to London for a new journalism gig and that in any case he needs the game more than he needs her. Dialogue is as pat as this sounds and once Chapel and the Tigers move to the ballpark it lacks the profanely salty nature of baseball gab. Instead mood is somber and cerebral as Chapel gets on the mound knowing this may be his last game and mentally rewinding the key events of his past five years. Effect of Chapel talking to himself and opposing hitters is both corny and close to feel of a Gary Cooper star turn as in ""Pride of the Yankees."" Inevitable flashback-flashforward structure takes over. Raimi and Stevens display affection for the central couple but a barely-there chemistry between Costner and Preston deflates the sexual and emotional energy. Hes tight-lipped enough for the two of them and it takes a mannered scene pulled off with aplomb by young thesp Jena Malone as Janes teen daughter Heather to inform Chapel that Jane ""has never had a love story."" Once Chapel finally visits Jane and Heathers funky home in a splendidly quiet domestic scene that recalls some of Raimis best work in ""A Simple Plan"" it looks like theyre going to be a family. Considerably more drama builds back at Yankee Stadium as Chapel is throwing heat and tossing a perfect game into the sixth inning. Mental duels with individual hitters are not as wrenching as they could be but a complete verisimilitude of play in the field plus a marvelously apt play-by-play commentary by (voice of the Dodgers) Vin Scully and Fox TVs Steve Lyons sweeps us up. In classic Hollywood fashion pic inserts plenty of heart-stopping plays to keep Chapels perfect game on tenterhooks. Amid this the indecisive nature of Chapels and Janes relationship eventually becomes more frustrating than rewarding and lacking even the juice of a Hollywood meller. Costner is as uneven as the storytelling itself stone cold at moments shimmeringly real in others. He is best as an athlete struggling with the fact that his time is nearly over. As a love interest he has always shone when he is most vulnerable but he falls short of that here. As a woman who goes through perceptible changes of heart Preston navigates an underwritten role that nevertheless has loads of screen time. Supporters are all game from Reillys good-guy blue-collar catcher and Coxs brief but strong turn as the owner to Simmons quietly strong manager and Malone in her best perf to date. Tech credits raise several moments to majestic heights powered most significantly by Steve Maslow and Gregg Landakers brilliant sound mix and John Baileys characteristically bright and crisp lensing.

Put the film to the Sleepless in Seattle guy-movie/chick-movie test and guys and chicks would argue into the night that it was theirs. You could call it the third of Kevin Costners Baseball trilogy. From Bull Durham through Field of Dreams to this he has gone from apostle to agnostic to saint. He plays Billy Chapel a starting pitcher for the Detroit Tigers. By the end of Pablo Ferros poignant opening-credit sequence weve learned that his father taught him how to play and that he was a phenom signed by the Tigers while still a teen-ager. As the film begins he is 40 years old has pitched 4100 innings over 19 years entirely for Detroit. The Tigers whove had a lousy season are in New York for a game that means nothing to them but is important for the Yankees who are in a pennant race with the Red Sox. The Tiger manager who doesnt want to roll over for the Yankees has Billy pitch a day early. Before the game the Tigers owner (Brian Cox) whom Billy calls ""Mr. Wheeler"" tells Billy that hes selling the team. Wheeler tells him first because he adores Billy not only as a person and because hes the heart of the team but because Billy is ""old school"" baseball He plays baseball ""to play baseball."" Money is among his secondary considerations -- which include most of Billys life outside the lines. Wheeler says that the new owners will try to trade him to the Giants. He asks Billy to think about what he has left to prove. Theyve got the space reserved for him in Cooperstown. The great ones he said dont need to be told when its time to retire. Then Billy learns that Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston) with whom he has had a five-year relationship intends to move to London for a job. Then he has to go out on the mound and pitch. Screenwriter Dana Stevens who adapted Michael Shaaras posthumously published novel and director Sam Raimi make an intimate experience of this public event by having Billy talk (rather than use voice-overs) on the mound To himself sotto voce to the batters to his teammates. The film is full of superb dialogue and what Stevens wrote for Billy to say on the mound is the best His baseball wisdom his wry pragmatism his assessment of his opponents and his teammates. As the game progresses the filmmakers flash back to catch us up on Jane and Billy who meet when her car breaks down as hes driving into New York for a game. Shes a free-lance writer for beauty magazines. She does not know that hes Cooperstown-bound because she knows and cares nothing about baseball. The characters are comprehensively written and played with great precision. The film details the steps by which the relationship starting out on a when-Billys-in-town-for-games basis grows into something that is intense and problematic. Billy whose default woman seems to be the team-masseuse type is delighted by this bright completely independent person. Jane responds to Billys gentleness sexiness quick humor sweet shyness. But she knows hes a project and that something intrinsic to Billys maleness is going to hurt her. It does; as Billy puts it she makes him ""feel weak."" Although she has supported him through a crisis the best she could she has not supported him in the way he wanted to be supported. All the women out there who have just said ""Story of my life"" raise your hands. For this five years Billy and Jane have been together maybe half the time. Heres what makes us root so hard for them We know that whether they end up together or not this is one of those love-of-my-life relationships. Billy and Jane will think of the other one on their dying days. So while the filmmakers torture us with will-Jane-get-on-that-plane? Billy thinks about how to get the next batter out -- and ponders if this should be his last game. Its not until the top of the seventh inning that he looks at the scoreboard and asks his catcher ""Have we had any base runners tonight?"" and the catcher says ""No."" I cant think of a single change Id want made in this film outside of the dialogue Stevens wrote as broadcaster Vin Scullys call of the game. It begins to say the obvious and then the obvious floridly. Raimis direction is unaffected and unrushed. The baseball action is hyper-realistic. This is a breakout performance for Preston to this point memorable as Tom Cruises shallow girlfriend in JerryMaguire. Theres classic chemistry between her and Costner. Hes 100 percent credible as an aging jock as youd expect. But hes equally persuasive and empathetic as a shy man and when hes crowded a stolid man. Want to know how a stolid man hurts? See this movie. Top-drawer gold-plated commercial filmmaking. Laughs and tears. You should get every penny of your moneys worth from this.

"Field of More Dreams - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Bull DurhamMovie Review Field of More DreamsCostner does baseball well but the romance of Game is a seventh-inning stretch.September 17 1999|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC Do you believe that the pitchers mound is ""the loneliest spot in the world""? Do you consider ""The Kid From Tomkinsville"" the greatest novel ever written? When an athlete says the only time his hearts been truly broken was when his team lost the pennant in 1987 do you nod your head in sympathy? ""For Love of the Game"" has your name on it.Earnest enough to win the Gee Whiz triple crown this reverential look at the game of baseball worships so passionately at the shrine of our National Pastime that it makes ""The Natural"" seem as dark and gritty as ""8MM."" Yet because its been directed in an almost willfully old-fashioned way by the unlikely Sam (""The Evil Dead"") Raimi when ""For Love of the Game"" sticks close to the mound those who have even a small soft spot for baseballs soothing rhythms will be hard-pressed to resist it.Helping matters considerably was the decision to cast Kevin Costner as pitcher Billy Chapel the Detroit Tigers ""great veteran right-hander"" who has his whole life pass in front of him as he throws what may be the game of his career before a hostile Yankee Stadium crowd.Of course given his success in ""Bull Durham"" and ""Field of Dreams"" putting Costner in a baseball movie does not qualify as a major league risk. Yet even if the choice was obvious the actor rewards it by giving one of his best performances. Laconic and iconic able to lend a measure of credibility to the corniest dilemmas Costner is intrinsically convincing as a star athlete and its pleasant to notice how hes been able to improve his work within his specific range.Adapted from the Michael Shaara novella by Dana Stevens ""For Love of the Game"" is at its best when its on the field with Billy listening to his mind work as he faces the Yankee lineup. Consulting with veteran catcher Gus Sinski (John C. Reilly) and carefully deciding what pitch will work for what batter in which circumstances Billy artfully maneuvers himself into a shot at a perfect game.Clearly a baseball fan director Raimi (known for his ""Evil Dead"" horror trilogy and last years ""A Simple Plan"" and one would have erroneously thought without a sentimental bone in his body) knows how to stage the on-field action so the hits and fielding chances have at least a whiff of reality about them.If baseball is the most successful part of ""For Love of the Game"" romance is its least satisfying. For one of the things that triggers Billys Yankee Stadium reveries aside from the news that the Tigers are being sold and he might be traded for the first time in his 19-year career is a crisis with his longtime girlfriend Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston).Shes a beautiful New York writer whos told him on the morning of the game that shes taking that job in London leaving that very day in fact. ""You dont need me"" she tells him flinging the words in his face romance-novel style and he wonders as the game progresses if that could be true.Sitting in the dugout inning after inning Billy reflects back on his cute-meet with Jane helping her with her broken car on a New York highway and on the twists and turns of their five-year relationship which starts as an oh-so-adult ""dont ask dont tell"" kind of affair and ends in nothing but tears tears tears. ""You are such a guy you are the ultimate guy"" Jane says at one point (truer words were never spoken) intimating that a guy of the regular variety would be enough for her.Costner and Preston have an acceptable amount of chemistry but these romantic shenanigans are not involving in the slightest. But while writer Stevens (""City of Angels"" was her last credit) has an unfortunate fondness for ""my heart leapt in my chest"" dramaturgy her script is actually a marked improvement over Shaaras paper-thin novella.Though his brilliant Civil War novel ""The Killer Angels"" (glimpsed at one point as Billys in-flight reading) was the deserved winner of the Pulitzer Prize ""For Love of the Game"" was not published during the authors life and only discovered after his death by his son Jeff. Its clumsily written and so devoid of usable personal incident that if not for Stevens shrewd addition of events and characters (like a daughter for Jane well-played by Jena Malone) there would be no film to speak of.But not even Stevens plotting and the actors efforts can hide the fact that all of this films usable emotion is invested in its baseball sequences. The romance between people in ""For Love of the Game"" is awkwardly handled playing like the afterthought Jane fears shes been in the pitchers life. The only love that really matters here is the one between a man and the game hes played for a lot longer than five years.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESIts the Losers That We LoveAugust 20 2000A consumers guide to the best and worst of sports media...September 21 1999Take Me Out to the BallgameApril 2 1998MORE STORIES ABOUTBull DurhamPerfect GameCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/17/entertainment/ca-11058,200,forloveofthegame18,forloveofthegame,latimes
"For Love of the Game | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; for-love-of-the-game ) For Love of the Game (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli For Love of the Game Kevin Costners third baseball related movie is appropriately named. Unlike the romantic comedy Bull Durham and the allegorical Field of Dreams For Love of the Game requires a basic understanding of and affinity for baseball in order for it to attain its maximum impact. That doesnt mean that a viewer who lacks an appreciation of the sport cant enjoy the film but baseball aficionados will take more away from this movie than those who have never seen a game read a box score or followed a pennant race. The best parts of For Love of the Game are those that take place on the field. Crafted with respect for the game and an eye towards accuracy they represent some of the most true-to-life baseball moments ever presented in a non-documentary form on celluloid. When For Love of the Game is between the white lines it is brilliant. Unfortunately that only happens about 50% of the time. The rest of the film tells a rather corny love story that is occasionally hamstrung by ripe dialogue. The romantic angle is necessary to the overall plot because it provides a sense of balance in the main characters life (not to mention its importance in drawing from a larger demographic to build the audience) but it is not written or developed as well as the baseball aspect. And while I dont think the romance is horribly presented its undeniable that a little less sentimentality would have resulted in a genuinely powerful movie with a stronger conclusion. Kevin Costner plays Billy Chapel a pitcher who has thrown every major league pitch in his 19 year career for the Detroit Tigers. When the team won the World Series in 1984 Chapel was a big part of the victory. Lately however he has sensed the approach of the end. For his team this has not been a good year and the baseball gods havent been kind to him either - his record is a lackluster 8-11. Now the teams owner has informed him that if he doesnt retire after todays game the season finale against the Yankees in New York he will be traded. Weary in body Billy takes the mound and gives it everything he has. As the innings go by his mind drifts back through the last five years recalling the only love of his life besides baseball. She is Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston) and she has just broken things off with him so she can go to England to advance her career. Billy remembers key moments in their relationship - the first time they met their ""agreement"" not to get too serious the time she surprised him at Spring Training when he was with another woman and the night he rescued her teenage daughter (Jena Malone). Then as the number of outs remaining drops into the single digits everyone in the stadium from the beer-guzzling fans in the stands to the announcers in the booth (Vin Scully and Steve Lyons) recognizes that Billy has a chance to pitch a perfect game. For seven innings no one has gotten on base. But as anyone who watches baseball knows the last six outs are always the hardest. Baseball is a humbling game. Todays hero could be tomorrows goat. The outfielder who makes a game-saving catch on Friday night might drop a ball or ground into a double play on Saturday afternoon. For actor Kevin Costner the movie-making business has been just as humbling. Only one decade ago Costner was one of Hollywoods most sought-after actors - a leading man with proven box office clout. His directorial debut Dances With Wolves was beloved by both the critics and the public and in addition to winning seven Oscars (including Best Picture and Best Director) grossed more than 500 million worldwide. However just eight years later Costner is Hollywoods whipping boy. He is blamed for the excesses of Waterworld and his sophomore stint behind the camera The Postman is a rightful object of derision. For Love of the Game is the actors attempt at a comeback - it plays to his strengths. Costner has never been a great emoter but his athleticism and screen presence allow him to be credible when on the mound. Kelly Preston (aka Mrs. John Travolta) does a competent job as the female lead but shes not a standout. She and Costner develop a warm on-screen rapport but theres not much in the way of heat or heavy duty chemistry between them. In supporting roles John C. Reilly is believable as the Tigers veteran catcher (who calls a great game but cant hit); Jena Malone (Stepmom) is Janes daughter and J.K. Simmons plays the Tigers manager with the right mix of irascibility and supportiveness. The director of For Love of the Game is Sam Raimi. For most of his career Raimi has been something of a cult figure and is still probably best known for directing the low-budget horror/comedy Evil Dead trilogy. His dark superhero tale Darkman also has a small but loyal following. Raimi broke into new territory last year with the taut thriller A Simple Plan. For Love of the Game is his first big-budget mainstream production and it represents a solid effort. The director especially deserves credit for the verisimilitude of the baseball sequences. The films structure - cutting back and forth between the final game of the season and the flashback highlights of Billy and Janes romance - works. The problem is that the script isnt as smart or insightful when it deals with a mans love for a woman as it is when it concentrates on that same mans love for baseball. I dont know whether the flaw is in the source material (a novel by Michael Shaara the author of The Killer Angels which was used as the basis for the 1993 movie Gettysburg) or in Dana Stevens adaptation but it diminishes the overall viewing experience. There are many things I like about For Love of the Game. In the first place the film understands which baseball clichA(c)s to keep and which to throw out. There is no World Series to win nor is the chronicled game especially big (at least not at the beginning). Were not being faced with a character making a comeback; instead this is a man in the dying twilight of a great career. I can recall the final ballgames of great pitchers like Tom Seaver Jim Palmer Steve Carlton and Nolan Ryan and its a bittersweet thing. Finally by the careful use of foreshadowing that hints at both possible outcomes (a perfect game or not) Raimi maintains tension nearly to the end. In many ways For Love of the Game is an old fashioned motion picture. Although it acknowledges the state of the game today (""Everything has changed - the players the fans TV rights arbitration..."") it views the sport with the respect it once had when it was Americas Pastime. My enduring image of baseball is of an older man and a young boy sitting together on a porch at dusk. Its a balmy August evening and the air is full of fireflies. Crickets and locusts chirp their nighttime symphony but the noise cant drown out the play-by-play coming from a transistor radio. Thats the spirit embraced by this movie. Today winning has become everything. No one seems to care about the simple rhythm of nine innings. As baseball movies go this one isnt a home run - its more of a single or a double. But as any fan knows thats still a hit and it can generate some excitement. For Love of the Game (United States 1999) Director Sam Raimi Cast Kevin Costner Kelly Preston John C.

Were down to the final frames of For Love of the Game and the big questions are still unanswered. Is Kevin Costner as 40-year-old Billy Chapel of the Detroit Tigers with 19 major league seasons and more than 4000 pitches on his frayed pain-ravaged right arm going to complete a perfect game in front of more than 56000 fans at Yankee Stadium on the last day of the season? And will Billy Chapel realize before it is too late and she flies off to a new job in London that Kelly Preston as Jane Aubrey talented magazine writer and editor and plucky single mom is the love of his life? But before we answer these questions and find out if the imperfect man wins his perfect game or exchanges his passion for baseball for a passion for Jane first a time out. Not to sell you a beer or a four-wheel drive vehicle but to tell all those guys out there who decided on the basis of the trailers and commercials that For Love of the Game was a baseball movie that Universal Pictures has tossed you a noon-to-6 curve. For Love of the Game is a baseball movie the way Youve Got Mail was a movie about the retail book business. But while youre standing there frozen jaws gaping ponder this good news and bad news For Love of the Game is two movies for the price of one a baseball story and a big gooey romance. You know a date movie. Yes deep down or au fond as the romantic French say For Love of the Game directed by Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan) is really about the love of a difficult man for a good woman. The baseball story thanks to Mr. Costners athletic credibility (see Bull Durham and Field of Dreams) and a complement of real ballplayers like Ricky Ledee Dave Eiland and Juan Nieves umpires like Rich Garcia and Jerry Crawford and other professionals works better than the romance. Taken together they add up to routine entertainment because the overloaded love story doesnt strike sparks or really tug the heartstrings and the script by Dana Stevens pivots on behavior that sometimes seems more convenient than character-driven and has some ludicrous lines. Underlying the story of Billy Chapels crucial game is the story of his five-year romance with Jane Aubrey seen in flashbacks as the star pitcher tries to coax one more win out of a worn-out arm while Vin Scully as the television announcer invests the proceedings with the prose poetry of the national pastime. And as Chapel battles the batters he is also harboring the news that the team on which he has spent his adult life is being sold by family ownership to a corporation that plans to trade him as fast as it can. Is it time to quit? In the let-em-meet cute onset of the romance Chapel driving a Porsche convertible while on a Tigers visit to New York picks up Jane at the side of a road where she is venting her fury on her broken-down VW. At first unaware of Chapels fame Ms. Preston playing the role of winsome woman that in recent years has seemed to be the property of Meg Ryan rapidly succumbs to his charms. And so begins a now-and-then relationship that gradually deepens and then shatters in the face of Chapels self-absorption and refusal to acknowledge any emotional need except for his profession. This can only end bloody for me Billy Jane tells him at one point. So as the big game begins Jane is at Kennedy Airport ready to begin a new life in a new country. John C. Reilly contributes neatly humorous support as Gus Sinski the stubbled catcher whose concern for the pitcher prompts Chapel to call him the ugliest wife in baseball. And Jena Malone brings honesty to her portrayal of the daughter born when Jane was only 16. But filmmaking like baseball is a team game and sometimes even a talented lineup produces unexceptional results. For Love of the Game is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes locker-room language profanity and a bloody woodworking wound. FOR LOVE OF THE GAME Directed by Sam Raimi; written by Dana Stevens based on the novel by Michael Shaara; director of photography John Bailey; edited by Eric L. Beason and Arthur Coburn; music by Basil Poledouris; production designer Neil Spisak; produced by Armyan Bernstein and Amy Robinson; released by Universal Pictures. Running time 140 minutes.

Starring Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston. Directed by Sam Raimi. (PG-13. 137 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Kevin Costner looks like a pitcher. Hes got a lived-in body and skinny legs. Hes got a baseball players unexcitability and resignation to the long haul. He is also sharp-eyed and extraordinarily watchful. So something must certainly be up when on the mound as aging aching Detroit Tigers pitcher Billy Chapel he merely gazes at the scudding clouds. ""For Love of the Game"" is the splendid title of Costners new baseball movie which is in every respect a romance. It is a romance about a man and a woman and it is a romance about baseball itself. Real fans surely must be tougher on pro ball than this movie is. In ""For Love of the Game"" lip service is paid to front-office manipulation and corporate finagling but there is no hint of the nitty-gritty that turns fans off -- the endless labor negotiations World Series-canceling strikes the obsession with absurdly inflated salaries. It doesnt matter. ""For Love of the Game"" is about the mythology of baseball. Scratch those same demanding fans and youll uncover a deep vein of honest sentimentality. Movies like this express big real emotions that people may be reluctant to put into words. Thats one thing Hollywood movies are supposed to do for us. Baseball isnt the only field of dreams. Things are bad enough for No. 14 right- hander Chapel the fading ""heart and soul"" of the Tigers when the movie begins. Hes 40 at the end of a lousy season with old injuries plaguing him and now hes got to face the fired-up Yankees who are one game away from the division title. Before he makes the long walk to the mound a pair of bombshells drop. The Tigers are going to be sold he will be traded (to the Giants) and the departing owner (Brian Cox) urges him to get out before its too late. Worse his fashion-writer girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) is taking the long walk too -- out of his life. The central action takes place at Yankee Stadium during one end-of- the-season game. In his slightly rusty voice Costner keeps up a running monologue with himself on the mound. He goes into reveries. There are flashbacks of the happy beginning and downward spiral of his five-year relationship with Jane. FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS There are flashbacks too of Chapels proud parents (his father was in love with two things ""my mother and baseball"") and of other players his catcher buddy Gus; a Yankee batter who was a former teammate on the Tigers; and a present one an outfielder who was the goat in a botched play. He has no choice but to throw hard (""Chap dont throw it away too early"" Gus warns him). Amazingly as the innings progress Chapel appears headed for a perfect game. Simultaneously in the flashbacks the relationship with Jane unravels. It is impossible to think of anyone but Costner in this role. His commitment and sincerity are never in doubt. Sincerity doesnt necessarily amount to much in actors -- and it has led Costner down a couple of unfortunate paths -- but here it counts. He is a perfect match too with golden-girl Preston (""Jerry Maguire"") who has exactly the same gray- blue eyes he does. Jane lives in New York and hes on the road. They see each other when they can and talk a lot on the telephone. But she doesnt intend to be a groupie and pretends to be nonchalant. ""You do what you do and I do what I do"" she says. He discovers that she had a daughter Heather now on the cusp of her teens when Jane was only 16 herself. Heather tells him her mother ""never had a love story -- its like she doesnt believe in it."" Director Sam Raimi known for horror and suspense (""The Evil Dead"" ""A Simple Plan"") may seem an unlikely choice for an inspirational sports romance like this. But it makes sense. The baseball-diamond scenes are his centerpiece. He builds them with tension and dynamism and nails them down with telling close-ups. He gives ""For Love of the Game"" such vitality that even some pat supporting characters and situations dont make interest flag. COSTNERS TOUCH Costner has a nice touch with sardonic humor. He calls bulldog- faced catcher Gus (John C. Reilly) his ""wife"" -- ""I have the ugliest wife in baseball."" Refused entry to a fancy Manhattan art opening he asks ""Whats wrong? I dont have enough black on?"" Jane is shrewdly presented as not interested in baseball. Not only does it give her a life of her own but it also gives those in the audience who may not be fans someone to identify with. They wont be disappointed. Sportscasters Vin Scully and Steve Lyons play themselves. Scully explains whats happening in his wonderfully supercharged rhetoric (""Chapel makes his fateful walk to the loneliest spot in the world -- the pitchers mound at Yankee Stadium"") and also mentions its been more than 40 years since he broadcast Don Larsens perfect game in the World Series (in 1956) which is in fact true. ..

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Baseball Movies Entertainment News If President Clinton were constitutionally permitted to run for a third term ""For Love of the Game"" would be his official campaign video. The syrupy swampy saga about an aging big-league pitcher facing the end of the line and realizing he has mistreated the woman he loves almost parallels the Clinton story. It even has that familiar catch in its throat that touch of spurious moisture around the eyes that permanent tone of manly regret. While its autumnal blend of baseball and romance may well make it a successful date movie -- the audience I saw it with snuffled and cheered at appropriate intervals -- like the Clinton presidency itself ""For Love of the Game"" has buried its good ideas beneath unforgivable fakery.Although Ive never been a big fan of Kevin Costner I admit that hes very comfortable putting his sunburned square-headed persona to work as Billy Chapel a basically decent profoundly inarticulate guy whos never had to face his own emotions. (Lets not even talk about the symbolism of his name all right?) Its been 10 years since we saw Costner play ball in ""Bull Durham"" and ""Field of Dreams"" so in our imaginations at least he really is an elder statesman of the game. Billy is often genuinely likable and I bet hed be a great character in some other movie. But this movie is a dreary humorless affair with no real feeling for the rhythms of either baseball or love. It serves up such a dense fable of baby-boom masculinity that you can virtually taste the Coors Light and Viagra seeping through the screen.Dana Stevens screenplay (based on a novel by Michael Shaara) is sentimental and plagued by implausibility despite the presence of a handful of real-life ballplayers and announcers. For fans the spectacle of longtime Dodgers announcer Vin Scully trying to breathe drama into the scripts platitudes will be downright agonizing.""For Love of the Game"" opens in an elegiac October mood with Basil Poledouris score spitting up minor-key crescendos at the rate of two per minute and then actually slows down. If youre not as old as Billy when the movie starts youll feel like you are by the time its over.Within the first few minutes Mr. Wheeler (the fine Scottish actor Brian Cox) the lugubrious Detroit Tigers owner who is planning to sell the team and trade Billy is already murmuring ""Everythings changed Billy. The game stinks and I dont want to be a part of it anymore."" Billy cant stay to talk; he has to rush out the door of the Waldorf-Astoria into Central Park to search for the woman he loves almost as much as baseball. He can only respond in the first of his 50 or so emotion-choked lines ""The game doesnt stink Mr. Wheeler. Its a great game.""So it goes. Billy and the Tigers are in New York to play the Yankees in the next-to-last game of the season. The Tigers have had another crappy year and are just playing out the string. But the manager wants to start Billy a onetime superstar whos now 40 and getting by on guile and a sore shoulder in an effort to deny the Yankees a playoff berth. Realizing this is certainly his last game as a Tiger and perhaps the last of his career Billy agrees but only if his favorite catcher a marginal player named Gus (John C. Reilly) who fusses over him like a mother hen also gets to play. ""Today Im throwing hard Gus"" announces Billy. Gus smiles and says ""You and me -- one more time?"" Billy answers ""Why not?"" You Might Also Like But maybe Billys really in the Big Apple because of Jane (Kelly Preston) the fashion journalist he ditched a few years back whos still on his mind. A bland and pretty but totally unspecific character who looks and acts as if she should co-host the ""Today"" show Jane stands Billy up the night before the game leaving him alone to drink minibar Scotch and ice with his elbow in the champagne bucket. As he takes the mound in Yankee Stadium shes planning to fly to London for a new job. When he catches up with her on an empty softball field in Central Park on the day of the game -- the pathos the significance -- she sighs at him ""You dont need me. You and the ball and the diamond -- youre a perfectly beautiful thing."" (That isnt Janes worst howler which comes when she cradles a souvenir baseball he has given her and coos ""I like to hold it in my hand because I know somewhere youre doing the same thing."")Her comment is of course trenchant. Preoccupied by his memories of Jane and the eclipse of his masculine powers Billy strides onto the hallowed sward of Yankee Stadium and begins to pitch a perfect game (that is a game in which no opposing runner reaches base -- a supreme and exceedingly rare accomplishment). Will he win on the field and in his own heart? Will his beloved Gus get the games key hit? Will Jane watching the game with a pack of abusive Yankee fans in the airport lounge -- one of the films few touches of realism -- actually catch her flight to Heathrow? These questions are really not worth asking. After all this is a movie in which when Billy gets in trouble he visualizes playing catch with his dad in the backyard. Billy begins to pitch his masterpiece much of it in the requisite super-slo-mo of all sports movies. During the game director Sam Raimi -- a onetime cinema whiz kid best known for his ""Evil Dead"" indie horror films of the 80s -- mostly takes us away from the diamond into a retelling of Billy and Janes relationship staged as if it were a soft-rock video. Ive rarely seen a screen couple with less heat or chemistry than the stoic Costner and the sunny Preston; they kiss like two strangers whove been told to squish their faces together as a form of exercise. Their acting like the rest of the movie happens in a baffling present tense. For all the tedious history were subjected to nothing we see on screen tells us anything about who these people really were in the 30-odd years before they met each other and we wouldnt know the flashbacks were flashbacks if we werent told.Jena Malone provides a few good moments as Janes precocious teenage daughter who in very little screen time establishes a warm comic relationship with the permanently tongue-tied Billy. If the two of them had any sense theyd head off together into some light stepdad comedy that would be a hell of a lot more fun than ""For Love of the Game."" But then nobody involved here seems to evince much good sense or integrity least of all Raimi who matriculated onto the edges of mainstream film with the terrific thriller ""A Simple Plan"" before graduating to this saccharine mishmash. OK Sam maybe you believed you had to sell your soul to Hollywood. But did you have to sell it this cheap? Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Reilly; Director Sam Raimi; Author Dana Stevens; Runtime (in minutes) 138; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted September 24 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT At 40 Detroit Tigers star pitcher Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is an old man in the business. His shoulder hurts. His pitching hand gets numb. And now this The team he loves and to which hes been loyal for 20 years is about to be sold. And his girlfriend Jane (Kelly Preston) has announced shes trading him for a job in London. Can Billy dig deep into himself on the mound one more time before his life changes forever? In For Love of the Game Kevin Costner returns to his favorite metaphor of sport as heroism A player with balls striving for personal perfection is Costner suggests cinemas purest image of the kind of unwavering loyalty irony-eschewing directness physical mastery individual initiative and commitment to teamwork that best represents American manly (subtext Republican?) virtues in a society where cataclysmic (subtext Democratic?) change is never for the good. ""Youre like the old guys"" a teammate tells Billy with admiration reminding us -- as this pennant-waving old-fashioned movie does time and again -- that glory is still available to a man (and even a movie star) in midlife. And if this bombastic crowd-pleasing baseball drama rouses us -- how could it not it so lovingly fetishizes every moment in one heck of a game in one heck of a season of Americas national pastime -- well then so much the better for Costner the movie star in midlife a complicated player who feels hes misunderstood by the Hollywood front office. After fulminating about the awfulness of change in stuff as torturous as Waterworld (in which anarchic violence caused a man to develop vulva-like gills) and The Postman (in which anarchic violence led to really late delivery of catalogs) its a relief to have Costner expressing his incontrovertible personal values back in the 20th century. I just wish that the bases werent so heavily loaded in Billy Chapels favor -- that we might be allowed to empathize with his human weaknesses a little more before rewarding him for his strengths. I just wish Costner trusted fans of the game to catch the spirit on our own. Depressingly for a plot propelled by a love story For Love of the Game sure strikes out when it comes to Billy and Janes romance. Theirs is a longtime relationship the pitcher reviews in his head while on the mound (when hes not muttering about batters) letting us know how much he loves her with a faithfulness and ardor thats impressive -- or would be if the other half of the couple had any substance to call her own. As it is Billy is pure and simple; Jane is flittery and neurotic. Billy says what he wants and how he feels; Jane doesnt have a clue about herself. Billy holds a baseball team together and is a hero to millions; Jane writes articles about facial scrubs a subtly sudsily demeaning detail. ""You dont need me. You and the ball and the diamond. Youre perfect. A perfectly beautiful thing"" Jane tells him (from a speechifying script by City of Angels Dana Stevens) as she breaks the news that London is calling. But whats she offering? Costner has a weakness for playing opposite mild female costars rather than actresses who can give him a run for his millions and Kelly Preston fits the plastic mold serviceable but wan and undistinguished a blur against which the actors own thin psychological contours can appear a little better drawn. But this imbalance -- which suggests a worry that audiences might redirect their attention for a moment -- does the actor the character and the story no good. Instead the believable love of Billys life would appear to be his catcher and devoted friend/nursemaid Gus Sinski who as played by the wonderful John C. Reilly has even more of an inner life than darling Billy. For Love of the Game has been directed by Sam Raimi a filmmaker (and baseball lover) who from The Evil Dead through last years low-key yet exciting thriller A Simple Plan usually makes great controlled use of kinetic gusto. I dont know what clubhouse confabs with star and studio brought Raimi to this temporary impasse. But in this particular game Costners determination to avoid change keeps this baseball movie at a low line drive when it might have knocked one into the bleachers.
