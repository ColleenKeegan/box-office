"Review Left Behind is a disaster in all the wrong ways - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Left Behind is a disaster in all the wrong ways Trailer Left Behind Without warning millions of people around the globe simply vanish. Without warning millions of people around the globe simply vanish. Gary Goldstein No rapture to be found in watching Left Behind a quasi-religious mess starring Nicolas Cage ""Left Behind"" should have been left behind.This execrable reboot of the film series -- no critical darling itself -- is based on the bestselling faith-based novels. Its a shoo-in to clean up at the next Razzie Awards. The movie also has the distinction of featuring perhaps the worst big-screen performance by an Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage. To say he sleepwalks through this one would be an insult to sleepwalkers.""Left Behind"" is also an insult to anyone hoping for any sort of credible theological discussion. The films religious elements are shoehorned in and woefully tossed off. Worse its hard to fathom where director Vic Armstrong and screenwriters Paul Lalonde and John Patus stand -- if anywhere -- on spiritual matters. Reinvented as a quasi-disaster movie the hackneyed plot finds Cage as Rayford Steele a shifty airline pilot flying from New York to London when the Rapture hits. The children on the plane and several crew members suddenly disappear leaving behind only their clothes. Spooky. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link Those remaining including a laughably motley group of first-class passengers and a sexy flight attendant (Nicky Whelan) all go a tad nuts. Only an investigative journalist (Chad Michael Murray) stays calm because yknow thats what those guys do.Much of the ensuing action takes place in the air as Steele must land the plane amid myriad fakey obstacles. He breaks seemingly every other rule in the aviation handbook.Meanwhile on the ground Steeles born-again Christian wife (Lea Thompson) and nerdy young son (Major Dodson) have vanished leaving his college-age daughter (Cassi Thomson) to navigate an emptied-out New York. Note When the Rapture occurs cell service will be really spotty. Cheesy visual effects flat shooting slack directing and pacing risible dialogue and characterization lots of crummy acting plus a painfully dull first act make this anything but a rapturous experience.""Left Behind.""

"Left Behind | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; left-behind ) Left Behind (United States 2014) October 03 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Theres no ""rule"" determining that religion-oriented movies are necessarily poorly made. Indeed there are examples aplenty of serious minded reverent motion pictures that work not only for pious viewers but for those with a secular outlook. The Passion of the Christ is an example and its by no means the only one. But then along comes something like Left Behind... Not only is this an amateurish travesty combining fundamentalist Christian eschatology with disaster movie b.s. but its plodding and tedious. The Left Behind novels have cultivated a sizeable and passionate following as is often the case with any long-running successful series. 13 years ago Left Behind was brought to the screen in a cheap cheesy adaptation that starred ex-""Growing Pains"" star Kirk Cameron. Now more than a decade later director Vic Armstrong has chosen to go the remake route bringing on board Nicolas ""Ill Star in Anything as Long as I Get Paid"" Cage. As incredible as it may sound Armstrong has moved forward with a worse screenplay cheaper set design and less polished acting. In a strange way however this is less like a remake of the original Left Behind than a revival of the old Airport franchise. One thing that differentiates Left Behind from the garden variety disaster film is that it feels the constant need to remind viewers that this was made by evangelical Christians. To that end we get lots of preaching and Bible verse quoting. Consider also the ""special"" effects which look like they could have been designed using a Commodore 64. (There is at least one big explosion to make all the Michael Bay fans happy.) Before mentioning anything about the plot its necessary to understand the End Times theology in play here. First comes the Rapture the event during which all true believers in Christ will be bodily assumed into heaven leaving Earth to the unsaved. Next comes the Tribulation in which mankind will be forced to endure a kind of purification by fire the grueling and torturous seven-year reign of the Anti-Christ. Finally Christ will return to judge the world and life on Earth as we know it will cease to exist. Left Behind is really only concerned with The Rapture and the wave of mass confusion and bad dialogue that results when a large number of people suddenly vanish like Obi-Wan Kenobi at the business end of Darth Vaders lightsaber. The story such as it is focuses on a father Rayford Steele (Nicolas Cage) and his adult daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson). On the day in question Chloe has come home for her fathers birthday but Rayford a pilot has been called into work. When she visits him at JFK airport Chloe sees something that leads her to suspect her father may be engaging in a fling with flight attendant Hattie Durham (Nicky Whelan). She also has a ""meet cute"" with hunky TV investigative reporter Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray) whos going on her fathers flight. The Rapture occurs while the plane is in the air. Theres panic in the aisles and Buck comes to Rayfords aid when he needs help regaining control of the plane and the passengers. Meanwhile on the ground Chloe freaks out when her brother disappears during an embrace and her devout mother (Lea Thompson) is nowhere to be found. By the end of the film our previously non-believing heroes have figured out that Mom was right all along and Gods behind it. Personally I like an alternative explanation proposed by one of the passengers alien abduction. There was a time when I was convinced no actor could fall farther than Marlon Brando. Superman was bad enough but The Island of Doctor Moreau? With this appearance however Nicolas Cage has surpassed him. Its hard to believe that an Oscar-winning actor could agree to front a production like this regardless of how badly he needs the money. And Cage clearly doesnt care about the material. ""Sleepwalking"" would be a kind descriptor. He acts down to the level of the rest of the cast which essentially means he pretends hes a bad high school stage show. His delivery of dialogue is just as cringe-worthy as that of his co-stars and his mugging for the camera is just as unprofessional. The next logical progression for Cage after this is to appear on next seasons edition of Dancing with the Stars. Back in July I felt sure no 2014 release would eclipse Transformers Age of Extinction for the distinction of the years worst film. I was wrong. Regardless of whether youre secular or spiritual Left Behinds title offers the best option of how to treat it.

Two pages later I wrote again ""No seriously what is this fucking music?"" Indiscriminately scored to what appears to be the soundtrack from an 80s infomercial and directed with all the nuance that suggests the early scenes of Left Behind quickly cement its place in the Bad Movie Hall of Fame. But its the later scenes when the plot becomes thoroughly unhinged that the movie enters another plane altogether. Adapted from Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkinss best-selling evangelical novels about the end times Left Behind is biblical in its silliness. Nicolas Cage plays Rayford Steele a semi-philandering airplane pilot who has been making eyes at the stewardesses (and one curvy blonde one in particular played by Nicky Whelan) ever since his wife Irene (Lea Thompson) discovered Jesus and began driveling on about the Rapture a year ago. Even their daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) seems to understand that Rayford might want to get away. Arriving in New York to celebrate Dadas birthday only to discover that he is flying off to London that very moment Chloe is strangely reflective even accepting aIf this were a year ago before Mom drank the Kool-Aid youad be home right nowa she tells him. aThis would all be different.a For his part Rayford is also rather Zen about it all aHey if sheas gonna run off with another mana he says of his wife awhy not Jesus?a The problem isnat simply that Irene has become super-religious itas that sheas become the kind of person who sees the hand of providence at work in natural disasters and tsunamis and pestilence a a believer in that particularly noxious variation on Christianity that sees large-scale human calamities as hopeful signs that the end times are near. That idea of course is also what Left Behind peddles. Because soon enough poof go the good ones a the children and the good Christians a disappearing instantly leaving just limp piles of clothes behind. And when millions of people suddenly vanish from Earth complications arise Driverless cars pile headlong into shopping malls (thankfully empty) school buses fly off bridges and Rayfordas plane is suddenly left without a co-pilot. The rest of the movie is mostly about Nicolas Cage trying to land the plane while angry passengers bicker and try to figure out what happened to their loved ones in particular their children. Meanwhile Chloe wanders (and wanders and wanders) around Queens. Not having read LaHaye and Jenkinsas books or seen the previous iterations of these films and more important not being a believer Iam clearly not the intended audience for this movie. (Or maybe I am a isnat this movie supposed to show me the error of my ways?) Early on Chloe asks of her mother aHow does someone see an earthquake on the news and then try to convince everyone that itas a good thing?a Iam still waiting for an answer to that question even though I get the distinct sense that the filmmakers think theyave answered it. Maybe the message is that itas good to die and go to Heaven because the Earth is about to get so much worse what with the antichrist coming and seven years of war and whatnot? That seems to be an idea founded in fear not hope. That said Iam not entirely sure that there isnat a way that this story might have worked. Conceptually itas an interesting idea Grab us with the crippled-plane suspense plot while plying us at regular intervals with religious propaganda. But that propaganda isnat particularly subtle; indeed itas at times rather laughable. (I wouldnat have blinked for a second if Kent Brockman from The Simpsons showed up yelling aItas in Revelations peoplea) At one point as he starts to unravel whatas happened Rayford looks through the belongings of two crew members who vanished discovering a watch that has aJohn 316a written on it and a datebook that has a aBible Studya class listed. Mystery solved I also felt bad for the poor kindly Muslim passenger (Alec Rayme) who despite clearly being decent and devout didnat get to go to Heaven because duh he worships a false god; not only that but the poor bastard is now stuck on a plane with a bunch of people who think that he had something to do with these unexplained ominous events. But really its the shoddy execution that kills Left Behind. All the nutter-butter end times stuff might have been tolerable if the film could string together a few scenes that werent laughably written and directed. (I havent watched the show The Leftovers but I gather that it concerns a similar type of Rapture-like event and does so without heaping dollops of ineptitude.) But from the manufactured bizarre interactions of the passengers on the plane to the pointless wanderings of Chloe on the ground to the utterly zonkers finale which involves an attempt to land a plane on a stretch of abandoned Queens highway Left Behind is a complete botch. As for Nicolas Cage he mostly seems annoyed. At times this fits the part As a pilot he has to keep his cool even as people keep pestering him for answers. At times it fits the part in more meta ways He may be wondering if all those ex-wives and fancy houses were worth a headline role in what will surely go down in movie history as one of the worst - not to mention craziest - movies ever made.

The Left Behind franchise implies that evangelicals havent grown up. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - This new film version the latest in a series of novels and flicks that date back to 1995 is a drama for the religious and by the religious with bright colors and inspirational soft rock. But the story itself tracks the nonbelievers Left Behind on an ordinary afternoon when God blips a few million chosen people to Heaven. What remains on Earth --  and in the sky where adulterous Captain Rayford Steele (Nicolas Cage) is piloting a plane of saints and sinners -- is chaos confusion and regret. And puddles of clothing which ironically also resemble the remnants of the Wicked Witch of the West as though an omnipotent Dorothy had doused the devout with water. Who are these divine nudists? First children which is perplexing for anyone who remembers the torment of seventhgrade bullies. The age cutoff isnt clear though God appears to be operating on the modern legal definition of 18 instead of the biblical standard of puberty. When the Rapture happens in a suburban shopping mall director Vic Armstrong pans up to mourn the suddenly ownerless balloons that bonk against the ceiling. And on Captain Steeles flight from JFK to London panicked parents pat down the plane as though their kiddos could be hiding naked in the overhead compartments. (Not shown the grumps secretly thrilled to be on a child-free transatlantic flight.) Film Details Left Behind RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time105 min. More Info Trailer As for the adults Left Behind makes an interesting distinction. Good and bad are irrelevant. The only thing that matters is faith. While the captains religious wife (Lea Thompson) is immediately zapped to heaven plenty of nice non-believers remain on earth including the captains estranged daughter and our heroine Chloe (Cassi Thomson); a newscaster porntastically named Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray); and even embarrassingly the local priest (Lance E. Nichols). When he attempts to console Chloe she snaps ""Listen to you? Why should I You didnt even listen to you."" Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm The film tsk-tsks at the truly wicked who loot the forsaken purses of the pure. Yet it doesnt scold atheists -- it seems to think of them more like the sad dog we glimpse in the background dumbly watching over its owners abandoned shoes. In large crowd shots they rush around in senseless panic acting less like sensible humans than like an anthill terrorized by a vacuum. But boy do the nonbelievers get a raw deal from the kind old woman who gets God-widowed in a blink to the hapless car passengers speeding to their deaths after their drivers disappear. The perverse implication is that you shouldnt be friends with spiritual people or at least never let them steer.Oddly unlike the first film in the series a 2000 Kirk Cameron cornball classic this Left Behind barely mentions the Rapture. Theres one conversation at the start when an airport wacko asks Buck if as a journalist who covers natural disasters hes read Matthew 247? (""And there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places."") Chloe rebuts that she doesnt understand why God would destroy the people he loves. The movie allows her to make the point and the Christian slinks off. Perhaps to appeal to the non-devout or at least not frighten them off this remake has half the religion and half the plot reducing the Biblocalypse into a straightforward disaster movie Can Captain Steele safely land his plane when the Eastern seaboard is in shambles? The first film solved that puzzle halfway through with enough spare time to introduce us to the Antichrist and his plan to rebuild the Temple of Israel. Neither get mentioned here. Instead the running time is spent avoiding religion to such a loony extent that no one explains that this mass vanishing is Gods work until the film is nearly over. Its almost as though screenwriters Paul Lalonde and John Patus believe people might buy a ticket to Left Behind and not know the twist like someone sitting down to watch Godzilla and being shocked by the entrance of a giant lizard.Who is this movie for? It cant be designed only for the pious as the religious characters spend their onscreen time being dismissed as nuts and then poof without a pause for applause. Yet its certainly not for anyone who just wants to see Nicolas Cage freak out and fight the Devil. Hes uncommonly calm -- hes practically the voice of reason. Helming a doomed jet Cage delivers lines such as ""Mayday mayday"" as though hes asking a waitress to refill his coffee. Even the howler ""Either Im going crazy or the whole world is insane"" is said matter-of-factly. Perhaps Cage flipped a coin before Armstrong called ""Action"" and decided to play this role straight. Alas he has robbed the irony-attuned audiences of their only reason to go. And so the Christian filmgoing audience will remain as insular as it has been for years only semi-preaching and semi-pleasing to the pre-converted such as those who confessed to Left Behinds message board that they feared God would Rapture them before theyd have a chance to see the movie.

"Tusk Kite and Left Behind movie reviews | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTusk Kite and Left Behind movie reviewsReel Brief reviews Tusk Kite and Left Behind all opening Friday.By Peter HowellMovie Critic and Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Oct. 2 2014TuskStarring Justin Long Michael Parks Johnny Depp Genesis Rodriguez and Haley Joel Osment. Written and directed by Kevin Smith. Opens Oct. 3 at Cineplex Yonge amp; Dundas. 102 minutes. 14AWrapped in his armor of fanboy sycophancy its hardly surprising that Kevin Smith would be unable to see the folly of his second attempt at horror following the more conventional Red State.Neither fish nor fowl in its ludicrous tale of an arrogant Yankee podcaster (Justin Long) being turned into a walrus by a deranged Canuck seafarer (Red States Michael Parks) Smiths Midnight Madness misfire flip-flops between bad comedy and dumb horror.Article Continued BelowA Manitoba setting gives Smith licence (he thinks) to indulge in the hoariest of Canadian jokes stuff that wouldnt have made it past a first draft of a Bob and Doug McKenzie goof on 1980s SCTV. (Can we knock it off with the ""aboot"" stuff already? Sheesh.)Sawa (India Eisley) is dodging street gangs while Samuel L. Jackson shows up as himself playing Karl Aker in Kite.Nicolas Cage plays a pilot who is also a sinner in biblical movie Left Behind.Justin Long stars as a podcaster in Kevin Smiths Tusk.The horror might have worked if Smith kept it to one good reveal of the Frankenwalrus which actually is pretty creepy. But ""excess"" is Smiths middle name so the show goes on . . . and on.An unbilled Johnny Depp enters the scene late in the film playing a glazed Quebec cop on the trail of Parks vile Howard Howe (no relation to Gordie). Its just a waste of talent added to a waste of time. P.H.KiteStarring India Eisley Callan McAuliffe Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by Ralph Ziman. 90 minutes. Opening Friday at Royal Cinema. STCSouth African director Ralph Ziman re-imagines Yasuomi Umetsus original anime of the same title setting it in his native South Africa. Purists will note the plot bears little resemblance to the Japanese version though both feature a kickass young woman named Sawa thirsting for revenge and a love interest named Oburi.Set in a dystopian near-future where society barely functions Sawa (India Eisley) is dodging street gangs like the Numbers -- whose display of acrobatic prowess are comically impressive -- dropping ""amp"" to forget the pain and determined to break up the child kidnapping ring of the Emir the man whom she believes killed her cop father. Samuel L. Jackson shows up as himself playing Karl Aker a cop who mostly keeps Sawa safe.Ziman creates a visually interesting graffiti-festooned landscape theres a plenitude of action -- including some truly goring death scenes -- and Eisley and Callan McAuliffe as Oburi are both nicely appealing. But the tedium soon sets in thanks mostly to a story that feels cliched beyond bearing including a final twist that is so ""never mind.""If youre satisfied with pure bloody action Kite is the ticket. If you want a little emotional and intellectual engagement try somewhere else. B.D.Left BehindStarring Nicolas Cage Chad Michael Murray Nicky Whelan Cassi Thomson and Lea Thompson. Directed by Vic Armstrong. 110 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGThe world may indeed be waiting for a great movie about the Christian end of days. But this turgid turkey starring Nicolas Cage as a sinning pilot who suddenly loses half his crew and passengers mid-flight during the biblical-prophesized rapture isnt it.Its notable only for the fact Satan appears to be on the marketing team for this turkey. ""Please do not bring unbelievers to this movie"" quoth Lucifer on one poster which is actually a pretty savvy move.Cage plays adulterous flyboy Ray Steele and Chad Michael Murray is tough-yet-tender reporter Buck Williams blessing us with two of the hokiest character names in recent memory.When a bunch of people suddenly vanish mid-flight leaving only neat piles of clothing behind -- not you Muslim man or you druggie girl or you Jordin Sparks -- Steele stands before them and intones ""I know you all want answers. And believe me so do I.""Since the rapture also sent a bunch of air traffic controllers heavenward Steele enlists Williams to help him land the now-crippled jet in New York. How did Irwin Allen miss out on this idea?Meanwhile Steeles perky daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) runs around below trying to manage the effects of the rapture at home amid chaos looting car crashes and women fighting over bags of designer goods at the mall.Directed by stuntman-turned-filmmaker Vic Armstrong Left Behind is billed as a ""reimaging"" of the original 2001 film of the same name starring Kirk Cameron which translates as paring the story of side plots while having more money for casting and enough left over for questionable special effects. The woozily bad script remains true to the original and its direct-to-DVD sequels. The tantalizing prospect that this could have been a camp set-up of the Snakes on a Plane or Sharknado ilk pops up as Left Behind starts to echo 1970s flight deck-driven disaster films -- and the parodies that followed. No such luck. Armstrong appears humourlessly earnest about his task. Score one for Satan.

Photo Teddy Smith/Stoney Lake Entertainment MOVIE REVIEW Left Behind Running time 98 minutes. Rated PG-13 (some scary sequences). At the Empire Kips Bay others. Halloweens coming and if you want to give an atheist friend the heebie-jeebies take her to this hackneyed religious thriller (think ""The Leftovers"" as interpreted by the Hallmark Channel). Nicolas Cage is clearly praying hell revive his flagging career with this amped-up bit of evangelical Christian propaganda. Like the plots Rapture-interrupted flight it does not go smoothly. The source material Tim LaHayes best selling series of ""Left Behind"" novels was first brought to the small screen in 2000. In it true believer Kirk Cameron played the role of investigative reporter Buck Williams (here played by Chad Michael Murray) who finds himself on a plane ride gone haywire when the Big Guy Upstairs snaps up his favorite passengers. Cassi Thomson and Lea Thompson in ""Left Behind.""Photo Teddy Smith/Stoney Lake Entertainment The remake carries the dubious cultural heft of ""Duck Dynasty"" star Willie Robertson who executive produced and the dwindling star power of Cage as reluctant hero Rayford Steele. Hes a philandering pilot whose wife Irene (Lea Thompson) is having a new love affair with Jesus and whose college-age daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) catches him as he dodges his own birthday party to fly to London for a tryst with a flight attendant (Nicky Whelan). Midway through the flight -- as all over the world -- a number of people vanish into thin air leaving their clothes in tidy piles on their seats. Pandemonium ensues as does dialogue like ""Ray Im scared. Arent you?"" ""I will be. As soon as I have time."" Featuring local-cable production values and dialogue that seems written by a crack team of Sunday schoolers director Vic Armstrongs ""Left Behind"" does no favors for the Christian proponents of its belief system -- that only those whove said yes to Jesus will be poofed up into heaven while the rest of us slog it out in some kind of ""The Road"" scenario to follow shortly. Nicolas Cage in ""Left Behind.""Photo Teddy Smith/Stoney Lake Entertainment Buck who meets and falls for Rays daughter when they cross paths at the airport ends up being Rays right-hand man on the increasingly wobbly flight whose remaining population is a whos who of central casting the doddering old woman the money-obsessed businessman the suspicious but ultimately noble Arabic man. On the ground Chloe dodges careening cars violent looters and women screaming ""Wheres my baby??"" before being informed by her local minister that theyve all been . . . well its in the title. The film momentarily picks up as Ray and Buck attempt to land the plane whose wing has been sideswiped by a crashing aircraft. Its not great art (in fact its pretty low-rent CGI) but its passably entertaining. Whats not is the films ham-handed moralizing about Christian conversion which is about as subtle as a ""Davey and Goliath"" cartoon -- and without the cool claymation.

Courtesy of Stoney Lake Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Stoney Lake Entertainment Nicolas Cage stars as airline pilot Ray Steele in Left Behind. Courtesy of Stoney Lake Entertainment The world is ending billions will die and hell is literally coming to Long Island. But the rebooted Left Behind doesnt want to alarm you. Fourteen years ago as a new millenniums arrival failed to extinguish our doggedly persistent universe the first Left Behind movie introduced a slithery Antichrist -- a U.N. official of course -- and the prospect of global war centered on Jerusalem. Just last month The Remaining treated the fundamentalist-Christian notion of ""the rapture"" as a horror movie littered with the corpses of born-againers whose souls had been called to heaven. The second attempt to create a successful movie franchise from the 16 best-selling Left Behind novels takes a gentler approach. The departed abandon only their clothing not their carcasses. And no demons are glimpsed in a tale that focuses tightly on the family of airline pilot Ray Steele (Nicolas Cage). As Ray tries to land a disabled jetliner whose co-pilot is now chilling with the man upstairs his challenges derive less from the Bible (1 Thessalonians 417 in particular) than from such moldy disaster flicks as 1969s Airport. For those who missed this particular end of the world the last time it didnt happen Left Behind is based on a series of sectarian thrillers by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. Adapting the books to the screen began in 2000 but the movies didnt click even as straight-to-church-auditorium fare and stopped at three. The producers of the latest round of adaptations have also promised three not a full 13. The revamped but still clunky saga begins as Ray prepares to fly from JFK to London by removing his wedding ring. Hes estranged from his wife (Lea Thompson) since she became a rapture-ready Christian and is hoping to spend some time with a sexy flight attendant once they land. This carnal design has so warped his judgment that he has decided to skip a family reunion with daughter Chloe (Cassie Thomson) who has returned from college just to see him. Chloe visits her dad briefly at the airport and while there meets famed daredevil journalist Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray) who will also be on that flight to London. Then she takes her little brother to the mall where break dancers bust some moves that are as fluid as the dialogue is stiff. This protracted setup moves about as briskly as the first three hours of Boyhood. Finally the righteous vanish and the rest are left to ponder their disappearance. Chloe searches for her sibling and mom both of whom are no longer in this world; her dad flies the damaged plane while piecing together the religious significance of what just happened. In first class Williams deals with unruly fellow travelers selected for their comic-relief value. Among the passengers is a pistol-packing sports-star spouse played by American Idol champ Jordin Sparks who sings the end-credits ditty ""I Wish Wed All Been Ready."" Viewers will wish that director Vic Armstrong and scripters Paul Lalonde and John Patus had been ready too. The movie climaxes with Rays attempt to land the plane an utterly nontheological struggle. This section of the movie is adequately staged if not exactly surprising. Its emphasis on real-world rather than supernatural threats is shrewd but sooner or later the new Left Behind series will have to focus on its sources real agenda. At that point the potential audience will evaporate faster than Chloes kid brother.

Academy Award-winning actor Nicolas Cage stars alongside Lea Thompson and Chad Michael Murray. Lea Thompson and Nicolas Cage in a scene from the motion picture ""Left Behind.""(Photo Stoney Lake Entertainment)Left Behind seriously could have used some divine intervention.Instead the latest adaptation of Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins literary Rapture-palooza tosses Nicolas Cage into a disaster film (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) that borders on ridiculous and sets up a potential new movie series for the popular Christian franchise.But when one character says ""Im afraid its only the beginning"" it comes off less as a warning and more as a threat to moviegoers.This is a slimmed-down story compared to the 2000 straight-to-video Left Behind movie with Kirk Cameron -- though a mankind-vs.-Antichrist scenario would have been welcome here. The new film features Cage as Rayford Steele an airline pilot flying from New York to London when God takes the righteous to heaven and leaves everyone else on Earth to deal with bad traffic and looters.Rays not exactly faithful to his ultra-religious wife (Lea Thompson) so its no shocker he sticks around. The other folks dealing with the massive loss of population -- mostly innocent children -- include scruffy yet good-hearted newsman Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray) on-edge football wife Shasta (Jordin Sparks) and Rays non-believer daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) whos on the ground when all heck breaks loose while her dad tries to land the plane and save everyone on board.Left Behind returns at a time when theres been an increase in similar God-fearing fare in theaters as well as an interest in religious apocalypse stories thanks to HBOs The Leftovers. Its a concept full of inherent drama that if done well could explore humanitys faith and foibles in an enlightening fashion.This is not that movie.Directed by Vic Armstrong best known for being Harrison Fords stunt double in three Indiana Jones films Left Behind is saddled with a script that is hamfisted in its preachiness Within minutes of the movies start theres someone up in peoples faces spouting Bible verses. The church crowd is coming to a Left Behind movie regardless but the shame is in the movie missing a chance to reach a wider audience.The performances dont help matters any with acting ranging from tolerably earnest to laughable. Cage keeps Left Behind from being a completely unholy mess. In recent years his roles have mostly veered toward the wacky and over-the-top yet here hes relatively understated and almost quiet as Ray is faced with wide emotional swings.Perhaps its spiritually karmic repayment for the opening of 1997s Face/Off where Cages priestly collared villain curses and gropes a choir girl while singing Handels Hallelujah Chorus.While the efforts appreciated Cage might have found a more heavenly project because this Left Behind doesnt have a prayer. 621 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 46 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1vBkaAq",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/10/02/left-behind-movie-review/16572991/,200,leftbehind(2014)8,leftbehind(2014),usatoday

""Left Behind"" is where the end of the world is a cheesy-looking bore. ""Annabelle"" quickly devolves into derivative predictability. David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint FLIGHT OF THE BUTTERFLIES [?][?][?] out of four stars Rating G for general audiences Theater Science Museum of Minnesota Omnitheater. When zoologist Fred Urquhart leans down within five minutes of arriving on a Mexican mountaintop and finds a tagged monarch butterfly that proves his migration theory it seems too Hollywood to be believed. And yet thats what really happened almost 40 years ago when the monarchs long-sought winter sanctuary finally was found. The story is charmingly told in ""Flight of the Butterflies"" the latest Omnitheater offering at the Science Museum of Minnesota. That the tag was placed by a schoolkid in Hopkins seems too Lake Wobegon to be believed. And yet thats also what really happened. The Minnesota connection changed the course of history. Youll leave better informed about monarchs and environmental concerns but also a little awed by the twists and turns and darn good luck behind a lot of scientific advancements. KIM ODE LEFT BEHIND [?] out of four stars Rating PG-13 for thematic elements violence/peril and brief drug content. SK Films ""Flight of the Butterflies"" follows the migration of the monarch. The end of the world is a cheesy-looking bore at least as depicted in this the second movie based on the first book in the bestselling Rapture-themed ""Left Behind"" series. Adding the star power of Nicolas Cage has not upped the quality. Cage left Las Vegas a long time ago but he can still bring the on-screen intensity for which hes notorious. Unfortunately hes downright lackadaisical as the pilot of a plane in trouble uttering such lines as ""We might have lost the landing gear"" as if it were ""Dont forget to buy milk."" Youd think anticipating the Rapture would inspire a great sense of urgency but the rest of the cast including Lea Thompson as his wife and Cassi Thomson (""Big Love"") as his daughter also recite dialogue like theyre sitting around at a first table reading. As for the action realistically depicting large-scale disaster takes a budget this 15 million movie didnt have. Fans of the evangelical-Christian film genre which is a growing money maker at the box office due to the enthusiasm of its target audiences should demand higher production values instead of blindly supporting a movie just because they appreciate its themes. KRISTIN TILLOTSON ANNABELLE [?]1/2 out of four stars Rating R for intense sequences of disturbing violence and terror. Last years ""The Conjuring"" a pretty good horror movie that managed to be genuinely frightening inspired not only a sequel due out next year but this prequel featuring the sinister doll Annabelle whose ugly mug could give Chuckys a run for its money. A promising start in which a Wonder Bread young 1960s couple (Annabelle Wallis and Ward Horton whose faces appear to be so Botoxed they look like expressionless plastic dolls themselves) find that their next-door neighbors have been slain by a Manson-like cult quickly devolves into derivative predictability. A slumming Alfre Woodard gives it her all but is wasted as a bookstore owner who dabbles in occultism. In horror there really is nothing new left to discover under the devil moon so the secret to startling audiences or at least raising hairs on the backs of necks lies in deft direction and editing both missing here.

Audiences however are unlikely to feel enraptured--even those seeking a so-bad-its-good Nicolas Cage spectacular. Based on the best-selling novel by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins the film is a reboot of Kirk Camerons 2000 adaptation and it imagines what happens when the Rapture comes. According to director Vic Armstrong that means all children and an untold number of true Christians get sucked up into the promised land all at once leaving behind their cartoonishly empty clothes and millions of baffled and scared heathens. At best Left Behind is shoddily made sensationalist propaganda--with atrocious acting--that barely registers as entertainment. At worst its profoundly moronic. Audiences Christian or not deserve better and its hard to imagine that the ham-fisted revelations in this schlock could serve any higher purpose. We meet our heroine Chloe Steele (Cassi Thomson) at New Yorks JFK airport. Shes just flown home for her dads birthday and has taken it upon herself to save the dreamy broadcast journalist Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray) from an aggressive religious zealot whos lecturing Buck on the biblical implications of natural disasters. Chloe shoots down the proselytizer with ease--she thinks about this stuff a lot we learn ever since her mother (Lea Thompson) turned to God and their family fell apart. Things are apparently so tense at the Steele homestead that papa Rayford (Nicolas Cage) has decided to ditch the family and spend his birthday piloting a commercial flight to London for a U2 concert--and the promise of an affair with a flirty flight attendant whos got highlighted hair. Chloe confronts Rayford as they cross paths in the terminal but he chooses Bono and the blonde anyway. Theres a lot of boring exposition crammed into the first act illustrating a throwback world divided between believers and non-believers in which air travel is still pleasant and malls are bustling beacons of commerce and impromptu break-dancing. Once the Rapture comes and the good are suddenly vaporized and transported to heaven (or something) the movie turns into a melting pot of disaster cliches including the obligatory mass panic bawling women and ridiculous car crashes. On Chloes long post-Rapture walk to nowhere shes nearly hit by a sedan a giant potted plant a propeller jet a man being blown out of a street-level shop and a small school bus careering off of a bridge. Rayford meanwhile is in the air trying to control the anarchy on the plane land it and get back to his daughter. This all sounds more fun than it is. Though he has a few moments of Cageian oddness for the most part hes disappointingly subdued and only slightly more watchable than everyone else. ""Let it burn see whats left"" his character says at one point. Cage might as well be talking about his career.

It disappoints in every way and lets down its core audience.Nicolas Cage stars as a pilot steering a fateful plane in the film ""Left Behind.""(Photo Freestyle Releasing)Story HighlightsCritics review 1 starNicolas Cage sleepwalks through his performance as a pilot flying a plane during the rapture.The acting is bad and the story becomes ludicrous.What starts out as a film about faith and family devolves into a disaster drama and a bad one.People often ask critics what the best movie theyve seen this year is which makes for interesting conversations and then follow up with what the worst movie is.Thats usually tougher to answer. So consider this a thank-you to the makers of ""Left Behind"" for giving me a solid answer.""Left Behind"" is a terrible movie bad in almost every way not even qualifying as so-bad-its-good material. The film directed by Vic Armstrong is based on the series of novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins about the Christian Rapture in which some people disappear taken by Jesus while others remain on Earth.Or as the production material says ""The most important event in the history of mankind is happening right now.""RELATED The 10 best apocalypse moviesSounds big. So youre making a faith-based movie and you want a big name in your cast. Bigger than Kirk Cameron who starred in an earlier version. So whom do you approach?Hey lets get Nicolas Cage to do it. Sure he was pretty twisted in movies like ""Wild at Heart"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas."" But if hes willing to be in those ""Ghost Rider"" movies hell be in anything right?Right.Cage plays -- with as little energy as possible -- Rayford Steele a pilot married to Irene (Lea Thompson) but since shes gotten religion as they say in the last year or so his eye has begun to wander. This makes for an awkward surprise reunion at an airport with his daughter Chloe (Cassi Thompson) as hes flirting with a flight attendant (Nicky Whelan). While Chloe is there she runs into Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray) a rugged famous television journalist.As fate would have it -- you can say that about pretty much everything that happens in this movie -- Buck is on Steeles flight. Meanwhile Chloe goes home and argues with her mother; shes not any more comfortable with her moms religious interests than her father is.RELATED azcentral.coms newest movie reviews | 52 Fall films to see in 2014Chloe heads for the mall with her little brother and while they are shopping poof Hes gone just like that. So are some other people at the mall and in other places including the co-pilot on Steeles plane. It seems random but Chloe and her father gradually begin to understand what is going on thanks to Irenes proselytizing.Nicolas Cage stars in a scene from ""Left Behind."" (Photo Stoney Lake Entertainment)Up to this point the film is a study of a family and its problems and where faith fits in. Its heavy-handed as all get out but its trying. But once the Rapture actually begins the film takes a major shift and the focus becomes getting Steeles flight home safely. Its like it turns into ""Airport 1975"" and Cage is Charlton Heston.Mini-dramas play out inside the plane involving among others Shasta Carvell (Jordin Sparks) the wife of a professional football player and her daughter; the flight attendant Steele has his eye on; and Melvin Weir (Martin Klebba) evidently the angriest little person in the world.Also the co-pilot disappears and the plane is running out of fuel and one of the engines is damaged and some of the equipment is malfunctioning and ... You get the picture. All thats missing is Lloyd Bridges in the control tower saying ""Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.""OK bad movies happen. A lot. But whats particularly unfortunate here is that faith-based movies arrive with a built-in audience one that is eager to like what they see because it is a pop-culture reinforcement of their beliefs -- beliefs that are often disparaged in that world.And thats what is ultimately so disappointing about ""Left Behind"" That audience deserves better.But thats not the worst of it. What really sticks with you are the lines that end the film when one character says ""This is the end"" and another no doubt with one eye on heaven and another on a series of sequels says ""No its just the beginning.""Now thats scary.Review Left Behind 1 starDirector Vic Armstrong.Cast Nicolas Cage Lea Thompson Chad Michael Murray.Rating PG-13 for violence.AZCENTRALLeft Behind (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Jenkins and Tim LaHaye The rapture wont come soon enough for the unfortunate souls forced to suffer through Left Behind the big-screen reboot of the direct-to-video faith-based film series starring Kirk Cameron. Essentially playing like a spoof of 70s-era disaster movies this adaptation of the mega-selling books written by Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye demonstrates that a bigger budget and a bigger star (Nicolas Cage) doesnt necessarily make ridiculous material any more palatable. After delivering its first Bible verse within the opening minutes the film introduces us to its central characters Rayford Steele (Cage) an airline pilot unhappy with his wife Irenes (Lea Thompson) religiosity; his religion-skeptic daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson); and Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray) a famous television news reporter who strikes up a flirtation with Chloe shortly before boarding her dads flight from NYC to London. Chloe has arrived from college to celebrate her fathers birthday only to discover that hes about to embark on a transatlantic flight. Exacerbating her anger is his apparent closeness with a sexy flight attendant who practically clings to him at the airport. Read more Faith-Based Left Behind Books Returning to the Big Screen Her suspicions are not unfounded as Ray is indeed planning a dalliance with the comely blonde once they arrive in London signaled by the U2 concert tickets hes apparently arranged weeks in advance. Not long into the flight a bizarre event occurs. Numerous passengers as well as a flight attendant and the co-pilot mysteriously disappear leaving behind only their clothes and personal belongings. We soon learn that the occurrence is happening across the globe with millions of people miraculously vanishing including Chloes mother and younger brother. The film alternates between scenes taking place on the plane with the left behind passengers understandably panicking and Chloe desperately attempting to find her brother amid the ensuing chaos which includes driverless cars and pilotless planes crashing all around her. Read more Satan is Promoting Nicolas Cages Newest Movie Realizing that both the co-pilot and the flight attendant were devout Christians Ray soon figures out that whats occurring is the event which his wife has long been predicting with only children and true believers falling under its aegis. When an errant airplane sans pilots clips his aircrafts wing hes faced with the task of returning his plane to JFK Airport (played none too convincingly by one in Baton Rouge) safely even as his fuel supply dips perilously low as if the film had somehow morphed into Airport 2014. Complicating his task is the motley assemblage of frantic passengers including a devout Muslim (apparently only Christians get to go to heaven); the wife of an NFL quarterback who thinks that her husband has somehow engineered her daughters disappearance and begins waving a gun procured from a vanished air marshal; and an angry dwarf whose glowering outbursts seem mainly designed to provide comic relief. The only thing missing is Helen Reddy as a singing nun. Meanwhile Chloe under the impression that her fathers plane has crashed climbs to the top of a tower with the intention of doing herself in. But just as shes about to jump she receives a cell phone call from her dad and Buck who entrust her with finding a suitable place for the plane to land since all the nearby airports are closed. The plucky young woman goes about her task with incredible ingenuity single-handedly clearing a debris-strewn highway and navigating the plane toward its destination with the handy compass app on her phone. Awkwardly combining religious proselytizing with disaster-movie tropes Left Behind with its sub-par production values howler-filled dialogue and terrible performances fails miserably on every level. Cage who in interviews has said he took the role at the urging of his pastor brother seems virtually sedated throughout even when his character is convinced that his plane is headed for certain doom. The first entry of an intended franchise the film only inspires hope that its creators will see the light before its sequels can be developed.

"Left Behind Review A Far From Rapturous Experience | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Left Behind Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer barkerrant 36 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr October 2 2014 | 0900AM PT Nicolas Cage has rarely looked more miserable than in this dreadful update of an already dreadfully adapted faith-based property. In what was surely a first in the annals of motion-picture marketing an early ad for ""Left Behind"" featured a quote taken not from a film critic but rather from Satan himself who allegedly quipped ""Please do not bring unbelievers to this movie."" This presents a rare scenario in which Christian moviegoers ought to feel perfectly secure heeding the advice of the Devil as this faith-based thriller is likely to inspire far more dorm-room drinking games than religious conversions. With a ""Sharknado""-inspired visual style and a deeply weary lead performance from Nicolas Cage ""Left Behind"" is cheap-looking overwrought kitsch of the most unintentionally hilarious order its eschatological bent representing its only real shot at box office redemption. The film hits theaters this weekend but as for when believers can expect to see the tenets of their faith reflected with any sort of sophistication or intelligence in a mainstream genre film we still know neither the day nor the hour. Appropriately for a film about the Second Coming this is not the first attempt to adapt Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins massively popular 16-novel series of biblically inspired speculative fiction (call it ""Bi-fi"" perhaps). Back in 2001 a bargain-basement version starring Kirk Cameron limped in and out of theaters followed by two direct-to-video sequels. With a considerably larger budget and wider release strategy this years edition can expect to do better business though it will have to put in a very strong showing to avoid becoming the alpha and the omega of the rebooted franchise. Directed by Vic Armstrong the screenplay by Paul Lalonde and John Patus substantially strips down the plot of the series first novel zeroing in on three characters as they pass the first few confused hours following the Rapture when all virtuous Christians are abruptly beamed up into heaven leaving the unbelievers down below. Cage stars as a hotshot airline pilot named Rayford Steele (because ""Jackbuick Ironmuscles"" would have been too on-the-nose) who has just ditched his newly Christian wife (Lea Thompson) for the weekend to carry on with a flight attendant (Nicky Whelan) whom he plans to seduce at a U2 concert after a flight from New York to London. Rays daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) is a dewy-eyed religious skeptic frustrated by her mothers abrupt conversion and fed up with her absentee father. And investigative journalist Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray) meets cute with Chloe at the airport managing to score her number before boarding Rays plane. As soon as the plane is over the Atlantic a slight jolt sees all the children onboard as well as some scattered believers vanish into thin air leaving their clothes and possessions behind. Chloe meanwhile is at the mall when her younger brother goes missing and must make her way on foot through the mildly unruly mob scene that has engulfed Long Island (unconvincingly played by Baton Rouge) to find her family. Sadly the film never speculates on which U2 members if any were raptured from their London soundcheck. From here ""Left Behind"" toggles back and forth between the two scenes typically using such phrases as ""What is going on here?"" and ""I think I know whats going on here"" as cues to cut. In the air Ray struggles to deal with mechanical failures and the disappearance of his copilot while passengers in the first-class cabin -- including the fearless Williams a fashionable drug addict a kindly Muslim an antagonistic little person a bolo-clad Texas businessman an Area 51 conspiracy theorist and Jordin Sparks -- bicker and kvetch. On the ground Chloe does quite a lot of running and gasping seemingly at a loss for how to fit herself into the story. Theres nothing wrong with using the trappings of a disaster movie to attempt to spread a Christian message beyond the already converted but ""Left Behind"" fails on several counts. Its spirituality manages to be both irritatingly sanctimonious and doctrinally vague; viewers who go into the film unfamiliar with the contentious Scriptural interpretations behind the series apocalyptic visions will leave scarcely better informed at the end. On a technical level the pics touted 16 million production budget actually seems high considering what made it onscreen with Armstrongs leaden pacing and chintzy visual effects sapping the action sequences of all tension or believability. One hesitates to dwell too much on the performances given the material the actors have to work with but there are several howlers throughout. Poor Sparks so likable in 2012s ""Sparkle"" remake has a dramatic scene thats so misjudged its difficult not to laugh. And as for Cage hes certainly been in worse movies than this but he seems too cowed by the storys religious underpinnings to embrace the crazy-eyed scenery consumption that helped make his late-career turns such guilty pleasures; here he simply looks tired. The issues with Cages performance may point to the biggest problem with the whole affair. There is nothing in the Scriptures that prohibits the good-natured enjoyment of schlocky B-movies no reason faith-driven audiences cant have a ""Showgirls"" or an ""Army of Darkness"" to call their own. Had the filmmakers embraced even a little bit of the plentiful camp value here ""Left Behind"" at least could have been entertaining. As it stands only the cheeky marketing person who thought to quote Satan in the films ads seems to have really understood what this pics proper tone should have been.

Kenyaone says May 21 2016 at 120 pm Its brilliant. The theme takes over from the screenplay. Utterly thought provoking. Its first film Ive seen that shows what a will happen exactly as its written in Bible no discussion no appeals no US special forces to the rescue. Just. Its happened. Deal with it No mercy no wrath. Just bad luck. We didnt make it. God is done with those left behind. They have to sort themselves out. Not easy when you realize 1. God and heaven are real and 2. You blew it. 3. Your kids are in heaven and they WONT miss you. The ending is fantastic just as it will be. Reply Jerry Cook says April 19 2015 at 836 am After reading all of the other comments (including my own) I finally realized something I should have preceded my last comment with None of us should forget the OPINION of the reviewer is just that; HIS OPINION The same of course can be said about every other comment here-they are OPINIONS (incuding my own) that are""flavored if you will by ones own beliefs and therefore should be treated as such-OPINIONS I usually find reviews interesting when I have the opportunity to see the movie myself and form my own opinion----Until they begin to get biased and especially derogatory. Come on people cant we just accept that movies are supposed to be entertaining and not life changing-that we can enjoy them for the story they (try?) to present and understand the reviewer is getting paid (usually) to present his opinion that may possibly be influenced by the person or group paying him to write his review? Reply Jerry Cook says April 19 2015 at 811 am I have now seen all 3 versions of this movie and am sad to say this is far from the best I heard the entire audio book series and enjoyed them. The first version of the movie with Kirk Cameron (as Buck) and real life wife as the stewardess was much closer to the book and much more entertaining. I do not claim to be a Christian but am a believer in GOD and Jesus Christ. I also got to see the second installment of the book series but felt it drifted away from the book slightly. Reply Jon says February 21 2015 at 314 pm It was the worst film I have ever had the misfortune to see so bad I had to keep watching to see if it could get worse. It did. I am stunned lost for words. All the amazing art humans can create then there is this. Reply Irene says January 18 2015 at 1203 pm Im an atheist who has noticed that a Christian movie cant seem to get a positive review from Variety. At least this review doesnt dwell on the fact that yeah the plot left some people behind but it still seems the reviewer is too afraid to admit there were some wonderful aspects to this movie. He also collectively insults Christian movies in this same review Movies with too much scripture run the risk of being boring. How many Americans are truly entirely unfamiliar with the concept? This is the first movie that has portrayed most atheists as likeable and only one as intolerable to the point that he annoys the others. The college age girl who we presume was raised atheist is so sweet that I must admit Ive never met an atheist college kid who was quite that sweet. This girl presumably raised atheist is trying to single-handedly hold together her family. I wanted to cry for her when Cage read her message in the ticket envelope ""this is the saddest day of my life"". Its clever (and endearing) that the only reason she argues about religion with her mother is because it is chasing her father away and that she still tries to hide any symptoms of family conflict (including any disrespect of her mother) from her little brother. Given the circumstances I did figure suicide was unlikely for anyone to risk so that part struck me as unrealistic. However the special effects were excellent bringing you into the anxiety but Im not sure why the author of this review thinks Nicholas Cage should be ""crazy eyed"" about the discovery that his wife was correct all along and he has been left behind with his daughter and his fling (who is also an ""innocent"" atheist unaware he is married). Its true he could have shown more shock but sadness and exhaustion is what you would expect after a day like what he suffered. I think it was intended to be a sad discovery and too much action from him would have made it seem more comical. Another clever aspect is how the boy points out that their father thinks the pastor is ""washing Moms brain"" and that sure enough we discover that their mothers pastor doesnt personally believe what he is preaching. It is likely that skepticism that the father picked up on. He thought her pastor was a con artist. But I also liked how when the pastor explains the situation to the daughter she responds with ""the God my mother told me about would never do that"" Apparently her mother was so desperate to get the girl to convert that she candy coated the religion. This movie picked up at the point where most Americans are. Atheists rarely complain that nobody ever explained the concept of salvation and end times to them. This movies creators know that most of its audience has heard the story by now. I appreciated the Bible verse at the end reminding Christians that nobody knows when the end times are. I am an atheist after all but this verse helps protect Christians from fraudsters trying to steal their money by claiming they know. This movie had a great deal of emotion and sweet sentiment and the atheists on the plane debating their theories regarding their predicament was funny. Admittedly Id probably do that but I wouldnt be the kind that scoffs at everyone else. Even Ive noticed that some atheists answer every theory with ""Come on Can you believe this guy?"" Reply kelly gallagher says October 22 2014 at 953 pm I love all the comments good or bad. As a pastor I am interested in the fact that Nick Cage took this part even though I doubt he is a real believer. From the angry midget tossing to the ludicrous secret rapture concept this movie is more humorous than an effective soul winning device but it will stir debate. If I am wrong I hope my pilots are atheists..wait..it wont matter for me Reply Paula says October 6 2014 at 157 pm I saw the movie yesterday and loved it. Nicholas Cage was superb as well as the rest of the cast. I was on the edge of my seat and even got goose bumps several times. I keep thinking about the powerful message and would love to see it again. I really enjoyed it. lt;3 Reply O.A. says October 6 2014 at 948 am As an evangelical Christian I think this review is extremely fair and I agree with nearly all of it. Its a shame that ""The Apostle"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"" are the only two good Christian movies. Reply soontobeangel says October 6 2014 at 919 am Reblogged this on Soontobeangel and commented Incredible review from Varietys Andrew Barker a favorite critic of mine. Enjoy his loquacious wordplay and his on-point wit. Reply Paula says October 5 2014 at 1210 pm I have enjoyed all the left behind movies low budget or high budget. I look forward to seeing this Nick Cage version very much. However it appears to me that some folks just came here to mock Christianity and leave ignorant comments for their own benefit. Tell me this if this had been a Muslim Buddhist or any other faith based film  would everyone start bashing them? No they would not out of respect but Christianity seems to be the only faith where everyone can disrespect it bash it and no one says a word. Why this double standard? I would encourage anyone to become open to the amazing word of God and start a personal relationship with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Blessings to all. + Reply Rex says October 5 2014 at 848 pm Are you serious Paula? If any -- I repeat ANY -- Muslim Buddhist or any other faith based film were as cheaply made and sanctimonious as the entire Left Behind series yes everyone WOULD start bashing them. Those religions dont get free passes; why should Christianity? Bad movies deserve bad reviews. For some reason Christians (and undoubtedly believers from all faiths) seem to think that ANY film that is simply reflective of their magical thinking should somehow automatically be above reproach and that wil NEVER happen for religious films any more than it does for mainstream movies. If youre so incenced at the widespread negative critical reaction to Left Behind Im sure there are other Christian movies that are given a more respect from secular AND religious critics because they EARN it by not a) preaching to the choir or b) trying to come off like big budget disaster epics on budgets that would barely cover the inevitable court costs of your average televangelist. Theres even some new flick out right now about a country singer or some such and its been getting MILDLY favourable reviews. Hey its a start but movies like Left Behind will continually ensure that any Christian film (finally) worthy of being viewed by a greater non-Christian audience will simply stumble at the gate because everybody simply expects it to be another sermon barely in disguise.

Im glad I decided to see for myself because it was very good true to the book and the cast did a great job especially Nicolas Cage. Reply Dick says October 3 2014 at 827 am Varietys Andrew Barker (aka Snarknado) pontificates with disdain about a topic that is deep stuff to Christians worldwide. This is not a movie review but an attack on the beliefs of hundreds of millions of Believers that those who do not willingly accept Jesus Christ as Savior will actually be left behind when others are ""caught up together... and meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever."" (1 Thessalonians 417) The Rapture may be a lot of things but it is neither sanctimonious or doctrinally vague. Reply Rex says October 5 2014 at 849 pm Oh shut UP Dick. Reply Dana W says October 4 2014 at 310 am This movie is only entertaining to the converted to the rest of us its pathetic and sad and a bit funny. The only people who can watch this movie without laughing or sleeping is evangelicals. The vast majority of Americans see it for what it is silly ideas for crazy people.

Reply rocky-o says October 3 2014 at 103 am ive always liked nick cage and i had hoped this film would get at least better reviewed...who knows exactly what the box office will be like...the movie itself is interesting simply in the fact that throughout the series of left behind books the hero of the story is buck the reporter and rayford the pilot is actually kind of a peripheral character..so why is it that the star nick cage is playng a basically minor role or has the script flipped its lead to the pilot rather than the reporter...id like to see this flick just to answer that question alone...but commentors are right when they say hollywood has lost all originality...reboots and remakes rule because they insist on hiring young writers who for the most part havent got a clue as to what they are doing there...i got a suggestion for them...stop hiring pre-puberty uninformed untalented writers and actors and hire someone like me who is not only a writer but someone who actually was alive when good films were still being made... Reply Rex says October 5 2014 at 856 pm Dude the Steele character was anything but peripheral in the first crappy Left Behind movie so why would he be in this crappy one? Especially when you can get such a fine upstanding human being as Nic Cage to play him? But hey if you wanna waste a ten-spot to ""answer that question"" you go right ahead. ;-) And as I write this the new crappy Left Behind is officially a turkey at the box office. But did anyone REALLY expect a different result? Reply raymond59 says October 4 2014 at 625 am Youre right when you say that ""....Hollywood has lost all originality...reboots and remakes rule because they insist on hiring young writers who for the most part havent got a clue as to what they are doing there..."" One of mt favorite movies is the 1941 movie ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"" which is based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benet. This retelling of the classic German Faust tale is based on the short story ""The Devil and Tom Walker"" written by Washington Irving. Benets version of the story centers on a New Hampshire farmer who sells his soul to the Devil and is defended by Daniel Webster a fictional version of the famous lawyer and orator. I can never get tired of watching that movie. Reply raymond59 says October 2 2014 at 545 pm Ill stick with the originial versions of the ""Left Behind"" series. Better acting better Directed and Produced and probably more close to the Book series. Personally I dont need a Hollywood copy-cat version. When Hollywood has to remakes of originial movies you know that they have no new ideas for coming from the Writers Vault. Reply Bob C. says October 2 2014 at 1257 pm The intended audience will flock to this movie and have rapturous orgasms as it truly will be a religious experience for them. More sophisticated audiences will avoid it in droves and dismiss it as a joke. But it DOES fill a void for people who crave this kind of entertainment as it should be. Reply DimoDammit says October 2 2014 at 1232 pm Pretty sure everybody in U2 gets raptured except for that insufferable Bono. Reply Carol Mathews says October 2 2014 at 1228 pm Well written. Thank you Reply Jonathan Stuart-Brown says October 2 2014 at 1227 pm Vic Armstrong has worked on movies since the 1960s and they have taken a total of well over 30 billion globally. Over 200 movies which have all made profit big profit or giant big profit. Nicolas Cage is the biggest star in Asia in the past few years and his reputation outside the USA is higher than ever. He has become the new Jack Nicholson Di Niro Pacino Bogart Jimmy Stewart and Cagney. People watch the movie because Cage is in it. The reviewer misses the fact he is playing the role as written just as he played a dying alcoholic to win an Oscar. Little hinges can control the biggest doors. Hollywood used to control global box office. In the 1990s over 80% was North America. Post Avatar (only 27% from North America) in the box office champ Hollywood is stumped viz what the global box office wants because it is not what the small Hollywood circle wants. The values beliefs assumptions considered 100% normal in the small Hollywood circle are now totally out of whack with the North American customer base let alone the much bigger world market. People want to go out and see must-see movies on the big screen but there are so few. Hollywood has lost its capacity to anticipate what people want and to understand their tastes including moral tastes. It will soon be time to switch the lights out on Hollywood as people leave rather than move to it in an attempt to advance their career. Only the losers will be unable to leave and left behind Sadly Variety - once a jewel in film review and film business news crown - will be among those left behind. It used to have its finger on the pulse and be trusted must-read but is now an uninformed unreliable unwilling to learn tired publication. Will the last one to leave kindly turn the lights out. Reply Rex says October 5 2014 at 908 pm Hey Jonathan if the ""values beliefs assumptions considered 100% normal in the small Hollywood circle are now totally out of whack with the North American customer base"" then WHY IS NO ONE GOING TO SEE FROM BEHIND NOW THAT ITS IN THEATERS? Its officially a dud. Are you going to tell me that all those Christians like yourself who think film publications like Variety are unreliable and tired ACTUALLY LISTENED TO ALL THE HEATHEN REVIEWERS WHO CALLED FROM BEHIND AS THE PIECE OF CRAP IT IS AND STAYED HOME??? That would never happen would it? Get out there pops and start injecting your money Reply H.M. says October 5 2014 at 102 am You have just described your own version of a Variety amp; Hollywood rapture Mr. Stuart-Brown. Cant say that I didnt find your fevered pitch entertaining. I can envision Martin Short for some reason saying this same manifesto you have as a character he would create. ""Nic Cage is big in Asia"". Does that mean they would be spared? Reply ChrisM says October 2 2014 at 531 pm With all due respect having ""worked on"" well over 200 movies since the 1960 is not the same as having directed and/or been directly or creatively responsible for them having taken in billions of dollars. It is highly unlikely that anyone outside of Vic Armstrongs family attended any of the Indiana Jones James Bond Superman or other titles Mr. Armstrong ""worked on"" solely because of his involvement. ""Left Behind"" is I believe only Mr Armstrongs second feature a the credited director with ""Joshua Tree"" being the first and a third one either currently in production or post-production. Taking nothing away from Armstrong is even with well over 200 highly respectable credits to his name to the general public at least still virtually unknown as a director. This movie will not play well in many markets outside of the USA where the rapture is not a part of their religious beliefs. China is a huge non-Christian market were this movie if it plays at all will be handled as science fiction. Reply Max Barber says October 3 2014 at 436 am Nicholas Cages career has gone from incredible to Steven Seagal. Jeff Tanner says October 2 2014 at 1211 pm The rapture is not a universally believed scenario in mainstream christian theology be it Roman Catholic Protestant or Eastern Orthodox circles. It IS a popular belief in many US protestant churches so lets keep the proper perspective on this. A final comment to anyone who is inclined to ridicule that they even decided to make a movie about LaHaye and Jenkins book lets see that ""all-inclusive open mindedness / Im ok youre ok were all ok"" spirit you apply to the latest new age trends Hollyweird types gravitate to and stick to critiquing the actual movie instead.

At least it will give them a chance of experience their spiritual fantasies in a sort of vicarious way maybe for a couple of hours. Then the movie will end theyll hopefully deposit their empty popcorn boxes in the trash rather then leaving them on the floor of the theater and then they can go back to living in the REAL world. As for Nick Cage I feel sorry for him. Hes done great work in the past. ""Adaptation"" ""Wild at Heart"" and especially ""Raising Arizona"" all come to mind. But it seems hes hit rock bottom with THIS movie. Reply See All 36 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO President On Vinyls Demise On-Screen Violence -TCA Chelsea Vs.

It aint what it used to be. In olden times we had Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny asking big questions or at least Debbie Harry and the Man from Mars eating guitars. These days were stuck with ""The Leftovers"" an etiolated HBO series by the guy who dragged out ""Lost"" for however many number of seasons. And now cometh this thoroughly mystifying reboot of the ""Left Behind"" movies (called simply ""Left Behind"") with an alarming bevy of blond beauties and Nicolas Cage at his most somnambulist. The mystery is why the movies are being rebooted. Why were the original ""Left Behinds"" left behind and does that mean theyre not in cinematic heaven? After all the original no-heaven-for-you drama scored a mere 16 on Rotten Tomatoes and grossed a very very very low 4.2 million. The reboot figures to ascend above that mark; praise be for ticket-price inflation. The usual problems with message filmmaking tie together the shoelaces of the new ""Left Behind"" With so much emphasis on proselytizing theres little energy remaining for you know characters plotting dialogue ... pacing ... It takes upwards of 30 minutes to reach the inciting incident. Seriously 30-plus minutes to get to the thing we all know is gonna happen. Antsy viewers will be praying for the Rapture by 10 minutes. For the unenraptured that ""thing"" is the abrupt disappearance of millions of people all around the world -- including all children -- leaving only clothes behind but not fillings or pacemakers or whatever. Guess God hates trousers. And about all kids being saintly -- the filmmakers have apparently never spent an afternoon in a preschool. Cage plays a glaze-eyed pilot winging toward an affair with an impossibly hot blond flight attendant because of his wifes (Lea Thompsons) unending evangelizing. Which turns out to be a virtue by the way. The evangelizing not the affair. Chad Michael Murray in the old Kirk Cameron slot is handsome as a crusading journalist who seems way too good to be left behind but is for dramatic purposes. Ditto new(-ish)comer Cassi Thomson who actually shows promise as Cage and Thompsons hot blond daughter. And theres a hot blond passenger too. Babies disappear on flying planes and parents object but dont tear around the aisles screaming or say look under the seats. People suddenly reveal themselves behind curtains to have Xanax-calm conversations. Because that happens a lot IRL OMG. That lack of concern for the way people actually interact renders the film useless as entertainment or as a conversion tool. Cage leads the Night of the Seated Dead performances so convincingly that when another character exclaims to him ""I thought you were dead"" ... (submit your punchline to datebookletterssfchronicle.com). Although there was this meme-worthy gem the payoff line delivered by Jordin Sparks ""I dont know what this is."" ""Why dont I just shoot you in the face?"" Its attitudes like that that get one left behind. Michael Ordona is a freelance writer. E-mail datebookletterssfchronicle.com. Left Behind Sci-Fi thriller.

Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Michael OSullivan October 2 2014 Based on Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkinss apocalyptic thriller about the end of the world -- a 1995 bestseller that spawned a series of 15 additional books and three film adaptations -- ""Left Behind"" centers on whats known in some Christian circles as the Rapture. According to this belief the End Times will be heralded by the bodily assumption of the righteous into heaven followed by a period of pestilence war famine and death for those left behind. (Translation One fateful day all God-fearing Christians will mysteriously vanish into thin air leaving nothing but little piles of dirty laundry -- and the rest of us infidels -- where they once stood. Its a viewpoint encapsulated by a bumper sticker you may have seen ""In case of Rapture this car will be unmanned."") This in a nut shell is the premise of ""Left Behind"" a 16 million reboot by writer-producer Paul Lalonde of his 2000 straight-to-video adaptation of the first LaHaye/Jenkins book. Kirk Cameron of ""Growing Pains"" fame provided the low-wattage star power for that first film which centered on an investigative journalist reporting on unexplained disappearances around the globe. Nicolas Cage is the new headliner playing Ray Steele the captain of an airliner whose co-pilot has inexplicably gone missing mid-flight along with a stewardess and several passengers. Its ""Airport 2014."" I wish I could say that the upgrade is a good thing. Cage an actor who normally can be relied upon to provide a modicum of entertainment even in -- maybe especially in -- his worst movies delivers what surely will be remembered as one of the lowest-energy performances of his career. Its tempting to call ""Left Behind"" a wake-up call to heathens except that it is simply put an exercise in tedium. Slumber on ye godless horde. The film is amateurish on almost every level. With the exception of Cage who is out-acted by his 1970s-style sideburns the cast is characterized by histrionics. Jordin Sparks is particularly awful as a distraught passenger whose daughter has disappeared. The general level of dialogue -- characterized by such boners as ""We have a right to know if were going to die"" -- is lame. The antique-looking special effects mostly featuring flying shards of broken glass evoke an old episode of ""CHiPs."" The editing is choppy jumping back and forth without logic from the people on the plane to the plight of Rays atheist daughter (Cassi Thomson) back on the ground where she seems to have misplaced her mother (Lea Thompson) and her little brother (Major Dodson). The music sounds like it was recorded in a casino elevator. Make that three separate casino elevators. It ranges from plinking lounge music to swelling strings to pounding outtakes from a made-for-TV disaster flick. To the movies credit the shots of the plane -- hurtling through the night sky with a plume of fire trailing from the wing after a midair collision with an unpiloted jet -- are visually striking. I have nothing against the fantastical even sci-fi-like premise of the film. After all Cages ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" and ""Knowing"" werent exactly documentaries either. But if youre going to make a movie about Christian eschatology that shoots for the mainstream at least make it frightening if you cant make it fun. ""Left Behind"" takes the end of the world and turns it not into a nightmare but a nice long nap. 1/2 star PG-13. At area theaters. Contains images of cheesy disaster mild peril and brief drug use. 110 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"Left Behind Review 0 Stars - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Left Behind 0 stars Left Behind trailer Left Behind official trailer 1 (2014) - Nicolas Cage movie HD Left Behind official trailer 1 (2014) - Nicolas Cage movie HD Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The little piles of clothes lying around post-Rapture are livelier than this thing. And away we go A little traveling music please for the Rapture the special guest star of ""Left Behind"" starring a sadly becalmed Nicolas Cage as a married airline pilot whose unconsummated lust for a cheap harlot of a flight attendant played by Nicky Whelan is enough to bring on Gods wrath the end of days and a cycle of protracted calamity starting with the film itself.Make that a cycle-ette. We dont see much actual calamity in director Vic Armstrongs picture described in the production notes as dealing with a ""biblical event"" which sounds like a sales initiative. All we see on screen is a little looting some weeping extras and a car or two careening out of control after the drivers have been airlifted by the Lord. The Rapture is a piker in this film; of its reported 16 million budget roughly 15 million appears to have gone to Cage on a dare that he maintain a straight face. ""Left Behind"" comes from the 16 books written by Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye. The books constitute a tremendous publishing phenomenon and not just within the broad evangelical fundamentalist camp. From these books three films have been made in 2000 2002 and 2005 the last two direct-to-video releases. The Cage-headlined reboot feels unlikely either to stoke the believers or seduce the skeptics.""Shes always trying to shove it down my throat"" complains college-age Chloe (Cassi Thomson) to her pilot dad (Cage) regarding her newly evangelized mother (Lea Thompson). Well hon go easy Cages Ray assures her as they sit in the JFK terminal. The terminal is played unconvincingly by a terminal in the Baton Rouge La. airport. Much of ""Left Behind"" concerns Rays attempt to calm his surviving passengers high above the Atlantic after the missing ones have been Raptured. Then theres a midair collision with a runaway pilot-free jet going the other direction. This footage is crosscut with Chloes desperate search for her family back on the ground. There are no answers in ""Left Behind"" for the record only intimations of tribulations to come and an opening for the antichrist should more ""Left Behind"" movies come our way.Cage is going for manly if conflicted family-guy confidence in this role but somehow it comes off as nuttier than the events surrounding him. Not since Dean Martin in ""Airport"" has a commercial flight been under the command of a less sober-seeming presence. I did like the bit however where Chloe down on the runway at night the world in cheaply digitized flames guides dads now-flaming wreck of a plane home with the help of her high-beams.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Left Behind millions of people--many of them children the rest pure of heart and intention--suddenly and simultaneously blip out of existence piles of empty clothes marking the final spot of land they occupied. Were they abducted by aliens? Were they vaporized by some powerful new weapon? Or is it all just a grand illusion a trick played on the folks still standing? Even for those unfamiliar with the source material a series of eschatological bestsellers by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins the explanation for this worldwide phenomenon should be pretty obvious. And yet for most of its two-hour runtime Left Behind plays coy not a single one of its characters uttering the ""R"" word. Its an odd oversight given they spend most of the 45 minutes before the mass disappearance having long awkward conversations with complete strangers about their religious beliefs (or lack thereof). An evangelical missing-person whodunit for moviegoers who already know who done it (Hint The culprit has His reasons) Left Behind is flush with mysteries of a different sort. Like how for example producer Paul LaLonde managed to make a version of this story even chintzier and more ridiculous than the Kirk Cameron flop he spearheaded 14 years ago. And then theres the question of why Nicolas Cage of all secular movie stars agreed to headline this faith-based clunker. Perhaps he claimed a sizable chunk of the films 15 million budget little of which seems to have made it on-screen. (Some of the film was shot in the Baton Rouge airport standing in for JFK. Most of the film looks like it was shot in or around the Baton Rouge airport.)Unlike the previous (and again improbably superior) adaptation this Left Behind takes a micro approach to the end times doing away with many of the globe-hopping elements. Cage plays Rayford Steele a pilot who cheats on his wife (Lea Thompson) apparently because he cant stand the fact that shes found God. His daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) introduced dressing down a doomsday prophet in the airport has come to Long Island to surprise her father for his birthday. Rayford however has to fly to London and so the two share a bittersweet reunion--but not until after Chloe has met cute with famous investigative reporter Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray) who just about every single character in the movie knows by name and face. Coincidentally he ends up aboard the same plane Rayford is flying; the movie has a way of making New York City seem like a small town with acquaintances running into each other in passing.Filming the action through a series of jerking pans and unmotivated zooms stuntman-turned-director Vic Armstrong tracks parallel dilemmas once the big disappearance occurs. Aboard the NYC-to-London flight a group of colorful characters debate their predicament demand answers and provide some groan-worthy comic relief; this group of lost souls includes a ditzy drug addict a smarmy rich guy a conspiracy theorist and a Muslim man who the film explicitly takes time to establish as a kind devout fellow presumably so the audience will understand that even the nice practitioners of other religions are denied salvation. Meanwhile on ground level Chloe makes her way across a chaotic Long Island narrowly avoiding being run down by both a driver-less car and a pilot-less plane. Its mass hysteria in the streets which Armstrong conveys by having hordes of extras run around in panic waving their hands above their heads.One need not be a Godless heathen to find fault in Left Behinds message-delivery system Its a fire-and-brimstone sermon wrapped in the tissue of a bad disaster thriller--a criticism thats dogged the book series since its earliest installments. But this adaptation is so broad cartoonish and ineptly made that harping on its theological methods seems like overkill; even diehard devotees of the franchise may crack up when say Rayford finally figures out whats going on by flipping through the personal calendar of one of the departed--and then breaking down into sobs when he finds the words BIBLE STUDY scrawled ominously on an open page. This Left Behind may be worse than the last Left Behind but its much less boring thanks in part to the commitment of its star who plays the often ludicrous material with the straightest of faces. The Cage works in mysterious ways.

(Stoney Lake) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday October 1 2014 254 PM Title Left Behind Film Info With Nicolas Cage Chad Michael Murray. Faith-based thriller about survivors of the Rapture. Director Vic Armstrong (150). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. This failed epic -- really an epic failure -- would barely be noticed were it not for former Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage taking on a ""Sharknado""-quality remake of a Kirk Cameron movie. If you saw the 2000 original you know that ""Left Behind"" is based on Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHayes evangelical novel about the Rapture. Director Vic Armstrong seems to have hustled up his budget for this Z-grade rehash by rifling through couch cushions which is too bad. A big-deal event like the coming of Armageddon deserves some big-time special effects. Instead Cage plays a pilot on an aircraft that was seemingly shot in someones basement. As Capt. Rayford Steele hes as shocked as anyone when half his passengers disappear. Where did they go? Why are they gone? His deeply religious wife Irene (Lea Thompson) could have told him. But being a believer shes gone too. Fortunately his daughter Chloe (Cassi Thomson) a proud skeptic is still around to help the survivors. So is investigative journalist Buck Williams (Chad Michael Murray). Journalists after all rarely take anything on faith. Instead we tend to ask a lot of questions. For example what has gone so horribly wrong in Cages career that he is forced to accept any paycheck that comes his way? Theres no reason he shouldnt make a religious movie if thats what speaks to him. But why would he make such a terrible one? A number of passengers have disappeared on Nicolas Cages plane in ""Left Behind."" (Stoney Lake) The script is barely patched together the effects are laughably tinny and the performances are so stilted youd think this was everyones first film. Honestly ""Sharknado"" star Ian Ziering would have done a better job milking this material than Cage who simply seems confused. ""I know you all want answers and so do I"" intones Capt. Steele. The sooner the better please.
