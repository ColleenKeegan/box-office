Entertainment The Two Movies Well Be Talking About For The Rest Of The Year Nate Parkers The Birth of a Nation and Kenneth Lonergans Manchester by the Sea set the Sundance Film Festival aflame. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Nate Parker in The Birth of a Nation; Casey Affleck in Manchester by the Sea. Elliot Davis / Fox Searchlight; Claire Folger / Amazon ID 7857423 Manchester by the Sea contains the saddest goddamn invitation to lunch youll ever find in the movie -- the sort of scene that floors you with its emotional rawness all of it unfolding in a passing sidewalk encounter. To be fair there arent many films that attempt to leverage lunch the most innocuous of meals into a conversational symphony of love and pain. But thats playwright turned director Kenneth Lonergans latest for you. Manchester by the Seas deep wells of emotion are there like sinkholes waiting beneath the day-to-day the calls that must be made the appointments that cant be avoided the jobs that have to be completed to keep the world running.Manchester by the Sea is one of the two movies thats taken the Sundance Film Festival by storm this year and its the more deftly made but definitely the less surprising of the two -- the finest possible incarnation of the sort of starry delicate drama that is a festival standard the kind that would have a teary lunch invite. The other hit is Nate Parkers directorial debut The Birth of a Nation about Nat Turner leader of the 1831 Virginia slave rebellion a fierce historical saga that feels like it strains the seams of an annual event largely devoted to the intimate and quirky. View this image > Kyle Chandler and Affleck in Manchester by the Sea. Claire Folger / Amazon ID 7857519 Theyre very different films but theyve both scored historic deals with Amazon nabbing the streaming rights for Manchester by the Sea for a massive 10 million after its premiere and The Birth of a Nation getting picked up by Fox Searchlight for a record-breaking 17.5 million. Theyre also both getting awards talk an exhausting thing to say when 2016s Oscars havent even happened yet but point made These are two films were going to spend the year talking about.Manchester by the Sea is centered on a Boston maintenance man named Lee Chandler played with breathtakingly submerged intensity by Casey Affleck. Lees been living a life of colorless isolation shoveling snow and plunging toilets and getting drunk alone at night and then into bar fights. The why of it all comes to light slowly after hes summoned home to the seaside town of the title up the Massachusetts coast after his older brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) dies and hes left in charge of his 16-year-old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges). Patricks a high school star an athlete with a lot of friends and more than one girlfriend -- hes a local boy who has no interest in selling his dads fishing boat and leaving behind everything he loves. But Lee it turns out has some very compelling reasons for not wanting to settle back in the close-knit home town he left years earlier the kind of place where everyone knows everyone and the past is never left to fade away. View this image > Affleck and Lucas Hedges in Manchester by the Sea. Claire Folger / Amazon ID 7857526 The more thats revealed about why Lee has chosen to live alone in a basement apartment far from his loved ones the less Manchester by the Sea seems like a story about how a grumpy bachelor and his outgoing nephew learn to share a home. Thats still part of it sure but more than that its about loss how grief ebbs and flows and exists alongside conversations about Star Trek and trying to get laid and about how it can sweep some people away maybe permanently.The films characters are working-class New Englanders who bicker and rag on one another easily but who arent always so free with expressing their feelings. Instead Manchester by the Sea lets details about its characters and their pasts accrue holding them up to the light and turning them to highlight every facet of their wounded vulnerable wholes. And while Affleck is day-wreckingly excellent he gets backup from a strong array of supporting players particularly a tremendous Michelle Williams as Lees ex-wife.Lonergan hasnt always had an easy time making movies. Margaret his last feature was delayed for years due to issues over final cut resulting in lawsuits and a film that was critically acclaimed but a box office bomb. Even after that he was able to get this new work made with help from producer Matt Damon originally also set to star. But The Birth of a Nations director screenwriter and star Nate Parker has had a tougher go of getting funding for his Nat Turner passion project. Hes been working on the film for seven years and was repeatedly told it wasnt commercially viable.Parker whos starred in movies like Beyond the Lights and Non-Stop and who got a standing ovation in the theater before The Birth of a Nation even screened actually quit acting to raise and contribute to what ended up being the 10 million he needed for The Birth of a Nation which he named after D. W. Griffiths racist landmark 1915 silent movie. View this image > Parker and Aja Naomi King in The Birth of a Nation. Elliot Davis / Fox Searchlight ID 7858022 Theres nothing particularly indie about The Birth of a Nation other than that studios were too chickenshit to fund it. Its a Braveheart-style historical saga made in the model of a big studio production even if it was done on the relatively cheap -- Mel Gibson after all was able to get 70-plus million to make his own story of a righteous uprising and won Oscars for it. But Parker could very well do the same. He made a passionate rousing and occasionally hokey movie in the same tenor centered on a man who grows up in a system in which he and his family and his people are treated as subhuman and who decides its not just necessary but his holy chosen task to lead an uprising against their oppressors.Turner was born more than two centuries ago but his story retains all of its urgency and fury. Parker is well-aware that when a character notes in the aftermath of the rebellion that people are getting murdered ""for no reason at all but being black"" its a statement as resonant now as it was then and through the decades in between. The Birth of a Nation leans into the systemic horror of slavery from the owner who casually knocks out a mans teeth with a hammer and chisel to ease his force-feeding to the way an auctioneer tears the dress off the woman hes trying to sell to better tempt the leering men in the crowd. When Nat and his cohorts explode into violence its as an answer to lifetimes of receiving it. View this image > Armie Hammer and Parker in The Birth of a Nation. Elliot Davis / Fox Searchlight ID 7857541 Most boldly The Birth of a Nation refuses to portray its slaveholders as just brutal sociopaths who can be easily put at a distance and it doesnt excuse them because sometimes theyre nice. Young Nat is shown playing as a child with the boy who grows up to be Samuel (Armie Hammer) his owner a man who steps in to protect him from time to time but still looks at him as a prize possession one he starts farming out as a preacher to agitated slaves on other plantations. Nat is horrified by what he sees at these places and sickened by the way hes forced to use his faith as a tool of placation. Samuels disturbed as well -- though not enough to do anything about the monstrous system from which hes benefiting or to question his place in it or to expect Nat to feel anything other than grateful for not being abused. Feeling bad counts rightly for nothing in The Birth of a Nation.The Birth of a Nation has its flaws -- its the work of a first-time filmmaker who has some great instincts (the last shot) and some clunkier ones in particular how the religious visions Turner had are realized. Its female characters -- mainly Aunjanue Ellis as Nats mother and Aja Naomi King as Cherry the woman he marries -- are thinly developed and when one of them is brutally assaulted its portrayed in a way that has far more to do with what it means to Nat than to the victim. But these are complaints that could be lodged at a lot of big movies and The Birth of a Nation feels very much like a big movie one that belongs in wide release among other films that have transmuted history into heroic cinema. Turner deserves this treatment; he deserves a film that doesnt soften the era or apologize in any way for his anger; and he deserves a salute for making it happen especially at a time when the movies desperately need a story like this.

Since nobody had yet seen the movie that ovation was probably a testament to the enormous number of friends cast and crew that were in attendance. The bigger ovation the thunderous one that came as the end credits rolled though? That was a testament to the enormous power of this film. Related Stories Nate Parkeras The Birth of a Nation Sets Sundance Sale Record In the film -- which just set a Sundance sale-price record when it was acquired by Fox Searchlight for 17.5 millionA -- Parker plays Nat Turner the Virginia slave who led an infamous short-lived rebellion in 1831. It lasted just a couple of days but it has captured the imaginations of many ever since. At the time the rebellion was used to justify new even harsher laws targeting blacks. It has also inspired numerous works of art music film and literature most notably William Styrons florid intense controversial 1967 novel The Confessions of Nat Turner and (my personal favorite) Charles Burnetts lovely 2000 documentary Nat Turner A Troublesome Property which itself is about the different ways Turners rebellion has been portrayed and interpreted through the years.A ""Each author possesses Nat Turner"" it is said in the opening to that latter film ""transforming his identity and the meaning of his revolt."" Nate Parker in The Birth of a Nation seems both to possess him and to be possessed by him. Not that much is known of the historical figure but Parker creates a full compelling portrait by utilizing what we do know -- that Nat was well versed in the Bible often saw religious visions and preached to his fellow slaves. In the film Nats childhood friend turned owner Samuel Turner (Armie Hammer) sells out Nats services as a preacher to other landowners who want him to help quell dissent among their slaves. When Nat opens his mouth the words come out with a force and a rage that betrays the pacifism and love hes supposed to be preaching.A That inner turmoil haunts the whole film. This is a whole world of deep contradictions one in which no one is at peace. Many films about slavery contrast elegance and degradation playing the comfort of the whites against the degradation of the blacks. But in The Birth of a Nation you get the sense that everybodys being degraded in some way by the institution of slavery. Sam once Nats closest childhood friend becomes more and more brutal driven by his desire to resurrect his family name as well as by the simple fact that the law gives him so much power over other human beings. The contrast here is not so much material as it is spiritual.A As an actor Parkers greatest strength is his ability to convey thought onscreen. Hes got probing eyes but a slightly quizzical turn to his mouth like hes trying to make sense of whats before him. (This is one of the many many reasons why he was so perfect in Beyond the Lights; we could see his romantic yearning and his sense of justice fighting across his face.) As Nat he has to show that kind of inner conflict even as he shouts Bible verses at his fellow slaves. ""Ive been following the Lord a long time"" he says at one point. ""Im going back through his words with new eyes. For every verse they use to support our bondage theres another one demanding our freedom."" The very words hes invested in are the very words helping to keep them in chains and theres anguish mixed in with his religious passion. Its almost physically painful to watch.A The rebellion itself is an intense and gruesome affair -- at times shot like a historical epic at times like a horror movie at times like an action movie complete with a head-crushing throat-slicing meleeA near the end. (Though Parker was working with a much smaller budget the film reminded me of Braveheart at more than one point. And it was intriguing to see Mel Gibsons name pop up in the end-credit thank-yous.) Parker doesnt shy away from the sheer unquestioning nature of the violence -- he even shows women being slaughtered in their beds. This is discomfiting grisly stuff and its to the writer-directors credit that he allows it to remain so without leading us along toward one interpretation or another. Its an exorcism as much as a historical lesson.A Perhaps the most impressive thing about The Birth of a Nation is how it alternates between the aestheticized and the immediate without compromising either. Scenes of abject horror are intercut with more dreamlike symbolic passages creating a push-pull to the narrative. Its a beautiful reflective film even as it is also a brutal visceral one. That stylistic dialectic reflects the turmoil within Nat -- his struggle to reconcile the world he sees with the world he reads about in the Bible. And his inability to do so in essence powers the explosion of blood that comes at the end. There I think is where the film resonates most. More than a movie about a slave rebellion its about the difficulty of reconciling the great moral chasms between thought vision and deed.A Tagssundance 2016the birth of a nationmovie reviewsmovies Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Now That Taylor Swift Is Definitely Less Innocent Than She Pretends to Be Whatas Next?

It speaks to his ambition that the writer director producer and actor Nate Parker chose to title his slavery drama ""The Birth of a Nation"" though the film would be a significant achievement by any name. Arriving more than a century after D.W. Griffiths epic lit up the screen with racist images forever destined to rankle and provoke this powerfully confrontational account of Nat Turners life and the slave rebellion he led in 1831 seeks to purify and reclaim a motion-picture medium that has only just begun to treat Americas ""peculiar institution"" with anything like the honesty it deserves. If ""12 Years a Slave"" felt like a breakthrough on that score then Parkers more conventionally told but still searingly impressive debut feature pushes the conversation further still A biographical drama steeped equally in grace and horror it builds to a brutal finale that will stir deep emotion and inevitable unease. But the film is perhaps even more accomplished as a theological provocation one that grapples fearlessly with the intense spiritual convictions that drove Turner to do what he had previously considered unthinkable. Certain to be the most widely discussed and rousingly received film in the U.S. dramatic competition at Sundance this year ""The Birth of a Nation"" comes to us at a particularly fortuitous cultural moment; not unlike ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Selma"" before it the movie occupies that rare space where our ongoing conversation about racial injustice converges with the film industrys slow-dawning awareness of the lack of diversity in its ranks. As a result this artfully modulated but fitfully grueling picture presents both an obvious challenge and a potentially rich commercial prospect for a distributor willing to match Parkers passion with its own. Careful positioning too will be needed to target open-minded faith-based audiences and also to address the inevitable backlash in some quarters given that the film presents its climactic violence in complicated but unmistakably heroic terms. No film worthy of this particular historical subject could hope or expect to avoid controversy and Parkers well-researched screenplay (based on a story he wrote with Jean McGianni Celestin) offers its own bold take on the widely contested narrative of Turner a Virginia-born slave and Baptist preacher who led the uprising that claimed 60 white lives and led to the killings of 200 blacks in retaliation and served as a crucial moment of insurrection en route to the Civil War three decades later. But ""The Birth of a Nation"" commences long before those fateful events with a series of scenes observing the Nats childhood on a cotton plantation in Southampton County Va. owned by the white Turner family from which the boy took his surname. In opening and recurring scenes that remind us of the land and traditions from which these black men and women were uprooted young Nat (Tony Espinosa) experiences eerie dreams of his African ancestors anointing him as a future leader and prophet as marked by the circular scars on his chest. ""Its not real"" his mother (Aunjanue Ellis) tells him when he awakens from one of these startling visions though theres no relief from the nightmare of their everyday reality -- and as it is they have a somewhat easier time than many of the other plantation slaves in Southampton County. Nat is allowed to run and play with the young Turner heir Samuel (Griffin Freeman) and hes treated kindly by Samuels mother Elizabeth (Penelope Ann Miller) who upon discovering that Nat can read encourages his studies by giving him a Bible. Years later despite having grown up picking cotton alongside his family in the fields Nat (now played by Parker superbly) is a soulful preacher with enough of a rapport with his master Samuel (Armie Hammer) to persuade him to buy a young slave Cherry (Aja Naomi King) sparing her from a fate even worse than what shes already endured. Cherry is brought to the plantation and before long she and Nat fall in love marry and have a daughter in scenes that afford a warm glimpse of their close-knit God-fearing community. Far from sentimentalizing their experience however these moments offer only fleeting respite from a life of continual hardship and menace whether its Nat making the mistake of addressing a white woman or Cherry falling into the hands of the cruel Raymond Cobb (a terrifying Jackie Earle Haley) with devastating consequences. Its no surprise the white slaveowners are getting antsy with talk of insurrection and rumors of violence in the air. Spying an opportunity the sleazy self-interested Rev. Walthall (Mark Boone Jr.) convinces Samuel to rent Nat out to other plantations as a visiting preacher as many slaveowners will pay good money to have a black man address his fellow brothers and sisters and hopefully quell any revolutionary impulses with a gospel of peace (aka subservience). What makes this development so bracingly ironic is that its Nats exposure to the appalling mistreatment of blacks in other parts of Virginia that convinces him a few encouraging sermons will no longer be enough. After a borderline-unwatchable scene in which he sees a slave being brutally tortured and force-fed Nat experiences a reawakening. ""I pray you sing to the Lord a new song"" he instructs his humble congregation and its clear that he means to take his own advice. Parker demonstrates a fine touch with actors (Dwight Henry Esther Scott Roger Guenveur Smith and Gabrielle Union round out the excellent cast) and his command of mise-en-scene would be impressive even coming from a more seasoned filmmaker. While the movie was shot entirely on location in Savannah Ga. the visual reconstruction of antebellum Virginia is outstanding From the drooping willows and white plantation houses of Geoffrey Kirklands production design to the muted bluish cast of Elliot Davis widescreen compositions the movie offers a vision at once nightmarish and painterly. As edited with measured intelligence by Steven Rosenblum (with the exception of one too-slick montage) and set to the stirring if sometimes overly vigorous accompaniment of Henry Jackmans score these images conspire to lure us into a world even when the barbarism pushes us away. But the films most resonant element isnt its physical realization so much as its spiritual and intellectual acuity and it skillfully draws us into Nats endless internal debate as he presses himself and God about his next course of action. If ""12 Years a Slave"" astutely mapped out both the ruthless economic machinery of American slavery and the complicity of white Christians who used the Bible to cow their slaves into silence then ""The Birth of a Nation"" delves even further into this unholy nexus of capitalism and religion and Parkers performance becomes a study in escalating outrage. A figure of warm earthy saintliness for much of the movie the actor (""Beyond the Lights"" ""Arbitrage"") slowly traces Turners moral hardening by incremental degrees driven by his deepening engagement with Scripture (""Do not become slaves to men"" he quotes at one point and some believers in the audience might well also turn to ""Faith without works is dead""). But he is also driven by his own worsening mistreatment at the hands of Samuel whom Hammer convincingly embodies as a man whose decency turns out to be strictly conditional. Turners own shift from Christlike grace to Jehovah-style wrath is not without its heavy-handed moments One crucial scene in particular would play infinitely better without the obtrusive positioning of a stained-glass window and the cutaways to Turners ancestral visions begin to verge on kitsch. But at its core this is as intelligent and probing an inquiry into the uses and abuses of organized religion as weve seen in recent American movies and also the rare slavery drama in which its the ideas far more than the whipping and lynching scenes that provide the deepest impact. Historians will have a field day debating the accuracy of the mans dramatic trajectory (as they have since even before the publication of William Styrons much-disputed 1967 novel ""The Confessions of Nat Turner"") and the urge to contradict a black filmmakers interpretation of history will of course be a hard one for many commentators to resist. The most vigorous discussion will center on the films ferocious frustrating and inescapably cathartic climax in which the tremendous strengths of its classical storytelling as well as its dramatic lapses stand in perhaps the sharpest relief. Parkers filmmaking suddenly shifts into the brutal blood-soaked idiom of the war movie in which various shades of moral gray are resolved in a queasy eruption of red (at the first Sundance screening the applause that greeted certain killings proved as telling as the anxious hush that followed others). The Christ-figure overtones hover ever more stirringly and disturbingly over the movies final moments and you may be forgiven if your mind drifts for a moment toward ""Braveheart."" The movie can be forgiven as well. ""The Birth of a Nation"" exists to provoke a serious debate about the necessity and limitations of empathy the morality of retaliatory violence and the ongoing black struggle for justice and equality in this country. It earns that debate and then some. Sundance Film Review The Birth of a NationReviewed at Sundance Film Festival (competing) Jan. 25 2016. Running time 118 MIN.

Looks and sounds like Butt hurt bias to me but hey usually its a sign that it hit home and some only want to bash it because it was so real and close to home for some. White directors can make a slave film with the throwing a cement block in the ocean with slaves attached killing millions on they way to America and it be celebrated by all but let A black Man of integrity tell a very vivid real and truthful story about Up rising and fighting for freedom and its a problem. Get over it Nate Parker you are a blessing and Thak you from the bottom of my heart for exposing a truth that needs to be heard and shared. Reply Martin Pal says February 5 2016 at 348 pm Just how many white people today are you comparing to having a mentality that compares to things like this film portrays? What exactly do you want white people to think and feel about a film like this and do you want them to ""do"" something after seeing it? (If so what?) And do you think only black people have been treated badly? Have you ever learned about the sweat shops that poor white children and women worked in at one time? Have you ever heard of the queer stockades that gay people were put in on South Pacific Islands during WWII that were lighted at night which made them targets for the Japanese. I could name other things but the point is that theres enough OFFENSE to be found in history for everyone if one wants to look for it. Nat Turner = religious man? Really? Reply keenangry says February 16 2016 at 703 pm The idea behind the film to have people understand that people who are pushed into a corner will fight for their God given liberty. And they have every obligation to do so against tyranny. No one would feel bad for nazis if their captives fought back. If so why should they? The nazis were wrong. Save owners were wrong. Those like john Brown and nat turner did the same as those who fight terrorist do - save those who were in need. isabellagarcia says January 30 2016 at 1033 am Nat Turner was a delusional religious zealot terrorist I would liken him to the ""noble"" beheaders of ISIS. Why when there are so many real heroes in the antislavery movement to present in films they would make this cold blooded murderer out to be a hero. Of the 55 people slaughtered with axes and swords 12 were mothers and 31 were mere children sleeping in their beds. If we must continue to pick at the scab rather than letting it heal how about a movie about John Brown and the numerous former slaves and abolitionists (including the second husband of Langston Hughes grandmother) who led a military style uprising to steal weapons from an armory to arm a slave rebellion; or one about the incredibly brave and selfless Harriet Tubman rather than Turner a raging lunatic who slaughtered women and children. This propaganda film reminds of something on the Third Reich by Leni Reifenstahl nicely made but distorted and dangerous. In the words of Nat Turner himself dictated to his sympathetic attorney ""And on the 12th of May 1828 I heard a loud noise in the heavens and the Spirit instantly appeared to me and said the Serpent was loosened and Christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men and that I should take it on and fight against the Serpent for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first. .... And immediately on the sign appearing in the heavens the seal was removed from my lips and I communicated the great work laid out for me to do to four in whom I had the greatest confidence (Henry Hark Nelson and Sam)-It was intended by us to have begun the work of death on the 4th July last-Many were the plans formed and rejected by us and it affected my mind to such a degree that I fell sick and the time passed without our coming to any determination how to commence-Still forming new schemes and rejecting them when the sign appeared again which determined me not to wait longer. ""Since the commencement of 1830 I had been living with Mr. Joseph Travis who was to me a kind master and placed the greatest confidence in me; in fact I had no cause to complain of his treatment to me."".(and yet when the time came to start the slaughter who did he murder first? Mr Travis and his family). ""Jack I knew was only a tool in the hands of Hark it was quickly agreed we should commence at home (Mr. J. Travis) on that night.... we determined to enter the house secretly and murder them whilst sleeping. Hark got a ladder and set it against the chimney on which I ascended and hoisting a window entered and came down stairs unbarred the door and removed the guns from their places. It was then observed that I must spill the first blood. On which armed with a hatchet and accompanied by Will I entered my masters chamber it being dark I could not give a death blow the hatchet glanced from his head he sprang from the bed and called his wife it was his last word Will laid him dead with a blow of his axe and Mrs. Travis shared the same fate as she lay in bed. The murder of this family five in number was the work of a moment not one of them awoke; there was a little infant sleeping in a cradle that was forgotten until we had left the house and gone some distance when Henry and Will returned and killed it;"" After his continued account of murdering several more families ""sometimes got in sight in time to see the work of death completed viewed the mangled bodies as they lay in silent satisfaction and immediately started in quest of other victims-Having murdered Mrs. Waller and ten children we started for Mr. William Williams -having killed him and two little boys that were there; while engaged in this Mrs. Williams fled and got some distance from the house but she was pursued overtaken and compelled to get up behind one of the company who brought her back and after showing her the mangled body of her lifeless husband she was told to get down and lay by his side where she was shot dead.""....."" On my way back I called at Mrs. Thomass Mrs. Spencers and several other places the white families having fled we found no more victims to gratify our thirst for blood."" Reply Avenger07 says April 1 2016 at 703 pm I understand the need to tell stories thats what cinema is for but in all honesty a movie as hard to watch as this harder even than 12 years a slave isnt going to bring in the crowds itll end up being another oscar bait period film about slavery god save us all if this movie doesnt win everything at next years oscars not for being deserving or great but for being what it is. Reply Cooper says January 30 2016 at 815 pm Brava. Well-said. Reply nbtx says January 26 2016 at 629 pm Movie about a murderer yeah I cant wait to see it. Read your history books instead. Reply Terry Boystrom says January 26 2016 at 556 pm Black people murdering whites. So little has changed. Reply jack4713 says January 27 2016 at 605 am A movie about a slave rebellion. Four million men women and children in bondage in 1830 and the death of 60 white slaveowners offends you? Have you had too much of movies about slavery? Roots Django Unchained 12 Years a Slave Amistad Glory. Five in forty years and ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Birth of a Nation"" before that? I feel you. (Amistad and Glory starred Matthews McConaughey and Broderick so not so much). Reply Kendall Segars says March 8 2016 at 1108 pm Sad and as gruesome as the murder of the white women and children sound....please consider that Nat Turner watched the sweetest white girls and children grow to be vicious and brutal slavers......Turners brutality MUST be viewed in that NO ONE WAS INNOCENT THAT COULD INHERIT SLAVES....and the failure of other insurrections was when the next generation was spared..... Levi says February 1 2016 at 1223 pm The death of mostly white women and children offends me. Nat Turner smashed in the head of a sixteen year old girl. If you arent offended by that you arent human. Bill B. says January 26 2016 at 1144 am Next years best picture winner at the Oscars. Reply Sara Rose says January 26 2016 at 1008 am Sounds like historical blaxploitation. Wheres Fred Williamson when you need him? Reply Tony says January 26 2016 at 705 am So...the only way Black people in Hollywood get recognition is by doing a slave film? Nothing much has changed. Reply Matt says January 27 2016 at 758 am Lol... youre quite simple. Reply Moshe says January 26 2016 at 656 am This period piece has many white folk getting slaughtered by a minority of black males. Same thing going on today nationwide. Reply jack4713 says January 27 2016 at 608 am Where is this slaughter of which you speak? I live in a majority black neighborhood and I am white and none of my Race Brothers has been slaughtered. And no one at the meetings knows anyone who has been slaughtered. Reply A Arismendy La Vega says January 26 2016 at 724 am Actually black males are killing each other. One would think you would like that Moshe. Reply Nate says January 26 2016 at 241 am Next year if BoaN receives multiple AA nominations no matter how well deserved on their merit there will be those who say the deck was stacked; just as this year the lack of nominations for deserving people of color led to all Academy members being labelled racists undeservedly. Beware unintended consequences Spike Will and Jada. Reply ceares says January 26 2016 at 336 am considering a stacked deck is how many movies and actors get their nominations so what? Its bull when people talk about choosing solely on the performance or on merit when its not even a secret that actors get noms and win sometimes because its their due and sometimes because the studio threw a bunch of money behind the campaign and manipulated noms for instance putting a lead role in the supporting category. There are movies that never even get watched because they are outside the comfort zone of the members and noms that come because of the prestige of the actor/director/performer and people that will never win because theyre disliked not because they dont deserve it. All this gets talked about every awards season and yet the idea of allowing considerations other than solely a deserving performance when it comes to inclusion is some how talked about as a violation of a sanctity that the Academy Awards doesnt even possess. Reply Nate says January 26 2016 at 732 am Im in total agreement but I stand by my previous comment; although I will narrow it by saying those who perceive the AAs as being given totally on merit will now say they are not. All that being said most people outside of the industry watch to make snide comments about the clothes. steve barr says January 26 2016 at 1223 am At least 10 nominations including four for Nate Parker . The problem isnt the Academy its the movies . Reply Sexracist says January 25 2016 at 1004 pm Nothing spells awards glory like religiously justified violence. If this is successful maybe the heroic Osama bin Laden biopic will finally get pulled out of turnaround. Reply bridgettegabrielle says January 27 2016 at 440 am Are you actually comparing a slave leading a rebellion to Bin Laden? I am not a huge fan of slave moves but stories about people overcoming oppressive regimes and fighting for their freedom have always been celebrated in Hollywood (ie. Braveheart). Why would this be any different? Reply Aaron1968 says April 16 2016 at 1254 am Well ""Braveheart"" was really pretty weak as a film. Sure its got some fun moments but the majority of it is so utterly obvious that it undermines anything positive that was being attempted. I guess I have given up on morally obvious black and white (no pun intended) presentations. Ill take gray any day. Mike says January 25 2016 at 952 pm The Confessions of Nat Turner was written by William STYRON. Hire a proofreader for Gods sake. Reply John Miller says January 25 2016 at 926 pm It sounds like a movie if it had been released last year could have gotten the nominations and quelled the controversy we are now hearing. Reply BK says January 25 2016 at 939 pm Becsuse thats all it takes.

TWITTER Nate Parker directs and stars in a biopic of Nat Turner who led an early 19th century slave revolt. Audaciously appropriating the title of the first blockbuster in Hollywood history a century later to turn its racial agenda upside down director-writer-lead Nate Parker at last brings the story of Nat Turners 1831 slave rebellion to the screen in a potent if also somewhat pokey manner that will nonetheless hit home with many viewers. A labor of love pursued by Parker for seven years the film vividly captures an assortment of slaverys brutalities while also emphasizing the religious underpinnings of Turners justifications for his assaults on slaveholders. Its a film very much in tune with the current state of heightened racial friction and one that will assuredly generate a great deal of media attention and probably controversy -- more for cultural and political rather than artistic reasons; creatively its a far cry better than Stanley Kramer but its no Son of Saul either. Still the wide success of 12 Years a Slave not to mention Django Unchained augers well for the enterprisingly made films commercial future. Parker refused acting jobs for the time it took to get this project launched itself a good story. But the real story is Turners a film of which has cried out to be made for decades and once almost was by Norman Jewison as an adaptation of William Styrons Pulitzer Prize-winning but subsequently disparaged 1967 novel The Confessions of Nat Turner. Recognized as unusually bright at an early age Nat Turner was taught to read and eventually groomed as a preacher for his fellow slaves in Southampton Virginia. Even though he had to pick cotton he didnt have it as bad as many of his color did but eventual exposure to the deepest horrors of the ""peculiar institution"" roused him to action as did his unusual religious visions and revised interpretations of biblical passages. In Parkers script the story for which he wrote with Jean McGianni Celestin young Nat Turner (Parker) is largely shielded from the worst depredations by a master roughly his own age Samuel Turner (Armie Hammer) whos trying to keep his fathers plantation going through difficult financial times. Nat can even exercise a degree of influence over Samuel as when he suggests that Samuel buy the attractive teenage slave Cherry (Aja Naomi King) so he Nat can marry her. Outsiders sometimes fault Samuel for his relatively light hand and Nat helps protect his fellow slaves from the worst of the worst. With careful but arguably undue deliberation the film offers a succession of vivid (if just briefly gory) set-piece depictions of white-on-black brutality beginning with the dental torture of a slave on a nearby plantation whos gone on a hunger strike. Cherry is attacked for no reason and for his part Nat is struck for merely preaching to slaves whose owners are more sadistically inclined than his own. When Nat is discovered to have baptized a white man its simply too much for the local bigots who have him whipped something fierce. Slowly but decisively Nats personal scales of justice begin to tilt the other way; a man who once dueled another over conflicting interpretations in the Gospel Nat now takes the edict ""smite the oppressor"" to heart using it as grounds to mount a slave insurrection that he intends will spread and deliver his people from tyranny. The screenplay builds up to this moment with care and even a degree of preciousness. On top of that the direction has its moments of eloquence and a handful of memorable images particularly one near the end a backward tracking shot revealing numerous bodies hanging from trees in a glade. All the same the deliberate and unvaried sense of pacing becomes monotonous just as turbulent dramatic undercurrents and a sense of building narrative momentum are increasingly missed. By the same token the staging of Nat Turners climactic nocturnal raid on white households during which between 55 and 65 people were killed mostly with axes and knives could have been made more sweeping and affecting. Partly perhaps it might have been a matter of budget and shooting time but a master action director could have made this into an amazing sustained sequence that ideally would have swept the viewer up in the horror of it all while provoking profoundly complex reactions due to its underpinnings. As it is Parker conveys the basics of what happened but without the more profound sense of what this incident represented morally politically and historically. He also severely telescopes Turners final weeks on Earth a period that could have been developed into an exceedingly dramatic chapter of its own. Still the film offers up more than enough in terms of intelligence insight historical research and religious nuance to not at all be considered a missed opportunity. Far more of the essentials made it into the film than not; its makers dedication and minute attention are constantly felt and the subject matter is still rare enough onscreen as to be welcome and needed as it will be the next time and the time after that. As he must Parker dominates the proceedings as Turner in a carefully judged and non-showy performance. He well suggests the mans early prudence and tact in judging what he can effect and get away with and what he cant and also illuminates the mans emotional and pastoral concern for others. His transformation into a man of action is perhaps less convincingly dramatized even if his motives are clear. Beginning with Hammer as a man who here and there suggests that under different circumstances he might not necessarily have felt compelled to enforce the prejudices and practices he inherited the supporting cast is solid albeit without the array of stellar supporting turns that graced 12 Years a Slave. Cinematographer Elliot Davis shooting on Georgia locations is astutely judged and particularly notable in the night shooting. Henry Jackmans score is unusually varied and draws upon multiple musical traditions and references to fine effect.
