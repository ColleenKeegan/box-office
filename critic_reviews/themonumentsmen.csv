By David Denby George Clooney directs a platoon of actors trying to rescue art stolen by the Nazis.   Credit Illustration by Victor Melamed A half century ago Burt Lancaster playing an unusually broad-shouldered French railroad worker saved art treasures stored at the Jeu de Paume from Paul Scofield as a Wehrmacht colonel with precise speech a foul temper and a fondness for Cezanne Matisse and Picasso. ""The Train"" directed by John Frankenheimer was set in the summer of 1944; the colonel was trying to take the works to Germany before the Allies liberated France. Frankenheimer working in handsome black-and-white did extraordinary things with rail ties heavy bolts and puffing steam locomotives and the two actors competed in physical determination. Lancaster a former acrobat scampered over walls and rolled down hills and finally shot Scofield who stood stock still by the side of the tracks. As an action film ""The Train"" remains first-rate. As a moral conundrum--Is great art worth the loss of human life?--it also holds up. For some reason George Clooney wanted to tell the story again though from a different angle. In ""The Monuments Men"" which Clooney directed the Nazis burn ""degenerate"" modern art while seizing such classic works as the Ghent Altarpiece and Michelangelos Madonna of Bruges and thousands of other pieces. Goring takes his share (a lot of it stolen from Jewish collectors); much of the rest headed for Hitlers projected museum in Linz gets deposited in mines and other hiding places. Clooneys ""monuments men"" try to find the pieces and stop the theft. Theyre an unlikely bunch of adventurers a sculptor (John Goodman) an architect (Bill Murray) a curator at the Metropolitan Museum (Matt Damon) an arts impresario (Bob Balaban) and a French art dealer (Jean Dujardin) all led by an art historian from Harvards Fogg Museum named Stokes (Clooney). As Stokes rounds up his crew and takes them close to actual warfare the movie feels like a cross between the jaunty ""Oceans Eleven"" and one of those large-scale films from decades ago about misfits operating behind enemy lines like ""The Dirty Dozen."" But the crazy-guys-at-war genre has recently been blown over the top by Quentin Tarantino in ""Inglourious Basterds"" and parodied by Ben Stiller in ""Tropic Thunder."" Do we need this latest film? Clooney and his longtime screenwriter Grant Heslov adapted Robert M. Edsels book (of the same title) but they dont really have adventure material on their hands--or at least nothing that warrants a monster production complete with tanks ruined French villages and soldiers from different armies. While the men chase down the art most of the threatened confrontations with the Germans--and later with the Russians who also want the treasure--fizzle out. The greatest physical danger for Matt Damon involves Cate Blanchett who plays a curator active in the Resistance. Blanchett reminds him that theyre in Paris and makes a pass. Damons response is an insult to the animal spirits of art curators everywhere. The movie might have worked on a smaller scale if it had focussed more on intellectual obsessiveness--on the zeal of connoisseurs who finally get to hold in their hands the works they have studied for a lifetime. Unfortunately Clooney has higher things in mind. He delivers several big speeches about the Nazis trying to hijack the common past of Western civilization. The talk is grand but then you realize that most of the works will be returned to private collections. People should be given back what was taken from them but those paintings werent part of a publicly shared heritage. Which sort of lets the air out of the bag for the rest of us when the monuments men stand in front of the art they love they are awestruck but the passion isnt there. For long stretches the tone of this nerveless film is self-mocking as if to say ""These blundering out-of-shape guys are tripping into history."" But then suddenly Clooney will throw in a young soldier dying in a welter of blood. With such unsteady direction its not surprising that the performers--John Goodman and Jean Dujardin as they get caught in the middle of a skirmish; and a tall deadpan Bill Murray and a small irritable Bob Balaban doing a Mutt and Jeff act--cant work up much of a rhythm. What would Burt Lancaster have made of such irresolute stuff? Everything he did was incisive forceful definitive. We may have gained something in humor by not taking the saviors in the art-rescue story very seriously but weve lost just about all of the romantic pleasures of heroism. Arnaud Desplechins ""Jimmy P. Psychotherapy of a Plains Indian"" is like most films about psychoanalysis a mystery story. Three years after the Second World War Jimmy Picard (Benicio Del Toro) a Blackfoot Indian who served in the Army in France is plagued by headaches sweats and recurring dreams and enters a military hospital in Topeka. The heavy-lidded Del Toro who is sleepy-looking at the best of times plays Jimmy as a quiet suffering man who has retreated deep within himself. He is seen by the psychiatrist Karl Menninger who became famous as a founder of the Menninger Clinic and a group of doctors determine that nothing is wrong with Jimmy physically. Then a detective of sorts arrives in Topeka--the anthropologist Georges Devereux (Mathieu Amalric) a live wire who knows Freudian theory and psychoanalytic method. Devereux whose 1951 book serves as the basis for the movie is also familiar with the culture and the religion of the Mohave and the Blackfoot tribes both of whom interpret dreams as a portent of the future. Following Freud Devereux reverses the method and takes Jimmys dreams as a revelation of his past. At first I hoped that Desplechin working with a screenplay he co-wrote with Kent Jones and Julie Peyr was going to match psychoanalysis and Indian religion as two kinds of intricate but emotionally satisfying inspiration--two dreams about dreaming--but I was wrong. The film is entirely respectful of the Blackfoot religion but it honors psychoanalysis as it was honored in 1948 as a medical cure. Jimmy is a puzzle waiting to be solved. As Jimmy describes his life to Devereux Desplechin stages scenes of him as a young man with various women and as a failed father. Del Toro plays Jimmys younger self without changing his face or his body in any way a device that offers a psychoanalytic sense of time the grownup man is present in the past; the past is present in the grownup man; the psyche may have many layers but they belong to a unified person. The movie keeps telling us that although Jimmy lived most of his life on a reservation in Montana he has the same issues as millions of other American men--disorderly love affairs a daughter raised by another man. This intelligent movie becomes a gentle reproof of prejudice and ignorance and I wish I could find some excitement in it. ""Jimmy P."" makes a post-hoc case for the lost art of psychoanalysis but its a loaded one. Jimmy is a perfect analytic patient he remembers his dreams he responds to questions and suggestions. Hes not glib or self-pitying yet he doesnt come off as an interesting man. Desplechin and his writers respect him so much as a Native American that they dont offer him say the sort of imagination that might have brought him to life as a movie subject. Even his nightmares are tame. Desplechin in his French films ""Kings amp; Queen"" and ""A Christmas Tale"" worked with a freer hand. ""Jimmy P."" is thoroughly repressed. Mathieu Amalric is short and not conventionally handsome with eyes that seem to be popping out of his head and taking everything in. Hes an eager candid actor yet the movie is coy about Georges Devereux. We find out from his girlfriend (Gina McKee) that Devereux isnt French as we might have assumed but his past is referred to only vaguely and left hanging unexplored. He was actually born Gyorgy Dobo in a corner of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1908. Dobo was Jewish and in the nineteen-thirties he changed his name converted to Christianity and came to America where he flourished on the borders of psychoanalysis and anthropology. He sounds like a wily and resourceful man--the possible subject of a movie much more exhilarating than this one.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

"Monuments Men The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; monuments-men-the ) Monuments Men The (United States 2014) February 07 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Monuments Men is a World War 2 story but its unlike the traditional World War 2 stories we have become familiar with over the years. Many of the historical touchstones are present including Normandy and The Battle of the Bulge. Roosevelt Truman Hitler and Goering all make appearances. However The Monuments Men is more about the aftermath of the wars great moments than the participation in them. These characters dont join in the bloody fray of D-Day; they arrive sometime after the beach has been taken. They dont fight in The Battle of the Bulge; they show up after the German retreat has begun. People die in The Monuments Men but in offhand ways rather than in the thick of combat. The unit of eight men is under the command of Frank Stokes (George Clooney) an aging art expert with movie-star good looks. His group dubbed ""The Monuments Men"" consists primarily of old historians and professors with a simple goal - save as much of Hitlers stolen art as possible. As the war draws to a close the Nazis intend to embark upon an orgy of destruction. The Russians want the art as ""reparations"" for the damage inflected upon their country. The Western allies however intend to reclaim it and restore it to those from whom it was stolen. The seven men serving under Stokes include three grizzled Yanks - Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) Walter Garfield (John Goodman) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) - looking to do their part in the war effort; Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) a Brit searching for redemption; Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) a Frenchman in exile; and the younger James Granger (Matt Damon) and Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas). Once in Europe they split into teams to go in search of the missing treasure then when they locate promising leads reunite to pursue them. For the most part they follow in the wake of the advancing army - near but never at the front. There are several significant plot-related problems with The Monuments Men. The episodic nature of the story disallows any sort of narrative momentum to build. Theres a lot of switching back and forth between the teams but too little time is spent with any of them for the characters to grow and the story to cohere. In many cases I didnt know the characters names - I identified them by the actors playing them. Its a bad sign when the film doesnt draw you in sufficiently for stars like George Clooney Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett (who plays an art curator and member of the French Resistance) to disappear into their characters. And its a definite problem when you think of Donald Jeffries as ""the guy from Downton Abbey"" or Jean Claude Clermont as ""the guy who won an Oscar for The Artist."" Most of the characters get A Big Moment but not much beyond that. The movie which runs a hair under two hours feels like it needs at least another hour to reach critical mass. I wonder how much was left on the cutting room floor. With talent like this in front of the camera it cant be all bad. The cast brings 17 Oscar nominations and five wins (with a sixth likely pending) to the party and theres not an inauthentic performance to be found. The most stirring moment is provided by Bill Murray as while taking a shower he hears the voice of his daughter singing a Christmas carol. Its a lovely moving scene - the kind of thing The Monuments Men needs more of. The film also looks great. Not only does it effectively capture the look of wartime Europe but it reflects the feel of some of the war films made during the 1960s and 1970s. Certainly the story told by The Monuments Men is worth telling and its easy to see why a luminary like Clooney would be sufficiently attracted to want to direct it. Unfortunately this treatment written by Clooney and long-time collaborator Grant Heslov isnt the best fit. One gets the sense that The Monuments Men might work better as a longer form project. Theres simply too much going on to cram into two hours and the end result is a feeling that pieces of the tale are being skipped while others are rushed through. The movie does a good job of illustrating why protecting art from the Nazi scourge was important but its far less effective fleshing out the personalities of the people who did the protecting.

""Good Night and Good Luck"" was a well-groomed lecture on McCarthy-era tyranny ""Leatherheads"" had its screwball romantic heart in the right place and ""The Ides of March"" smuggled a weary post-Watergate cynicism into its present-day tale of political treachery. (His first and arguably best film ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" was the exception to this trend thanks to the reliably knotty Charlie Kaufman screenplay and a livewire Sam Rockwell performance.) Clooneys latest directorial effort ""The Monuments Men"" certainly has all of the proper ingredients for an old-fashioned throwback a fact-based tale of international art scholars assembled to retrieve stores of Europes greatest pieces from retreating German forces and the approaching Russians at the end of World War II; the uneasy cost of a current generations lives and future generations cherished works; an all-star cast (Clooney Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman Cate Blanchett Jean Dujardin) assembling for the irresistible men-on-a-mission routine; and a rousing Alexandre Desplat score in the vein of classic military marches. So why doesnt it work? ""Monuments"" certainly isnt unbearable to watch but for all its quality pedigree and good intentions the result is a frustratingly flat film that drifts from moment to moment with a curious lack of urgency and an overbearing sense of self-importance primarily fueled by speeches lectures or radio addresses from Capt. Clooney about how only they can accomplish this culturally significant task as towns crumble before them and blowhards in tents refuse to help their orders. Many of the characters are tidily split off from the group Damons art historian seeks out a particularly knowledgeable secretary (Blanchett) in Paris while Murray and Balaban do the odd couple bit in the French countryside and Hugh Bonnevilles disgraced Brit goes off on his own mini arc of redemption. Each pair is generally assigned a moment or two of levity -- Damon and Blanchett have a not-quite-romance; Murray picks on Balabans short stature and low rank -- usually involving some pat banter followed by a beat of wartime severity to sober things back up (usually a death that hardly packs a punch or a frustratingly casual allusion to the Holocaust being committed elsewhere). Clooney and co-writer/producer Grant Heslov veer back and forth between character-driven beats which reveal awfully little about each of our soldier boys before reuniting them with or for another round of Why This is Important You Guys. With each passing address Desplats score rouses a bit less and with each new find we know that the story cant end until these heroes find two primary pieces of art upon which weve been coached to attach our interests a series of priceless paintings and a sculpture of more sentimental importance. Occasionally a scene gives us cause to sit up a civilized dinner table meet-and-greet that nimbly balances humor and tension before ending much too soon; a grave interrogation involving a German officer and a Jewish deli; a much-needed message from home heard over a phonograph. That last scene would have sufficed with its intended audience tearing up in a shower to the strains of ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" but Clooney cannot resist adding a note of irony by taking us into the infirmary as well. Its a gesture which speaks volumes to the films overall lack of trust in its audience instead insisting upon us the crucial nature and sometimes uncomfortable reality of such a mission. For a movie which worships great art ""The Monuments Men"" hardly ever embodies it and to say ""They dont make em like this anymore"" is to ignore that yesteryear had its own fair share of noble-yet-stodgy pictures. To say ""They dont make em like this anymore"" is to ignore that they already have John Frankenheimers historical thriller ""The Train"" turns 50 this year and tackled similar wartime art preservation with a sharp sense of craft and a vital narrative drive. That films final moments cutting between spilled crates and spent corpses say more about weighing the worth of great art against the value of human lives -- all without saying a single word.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday February 6 2014 Follow AnnHornaday ""The Monuments Men"" a film that George Clooney co-wrote directed and stars in continues his long-standing -- even heroic -- effort to preserve a certain kind of movie in the American filmmaking canon. From the films hes directed (""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" ""Good Night and Good Luck"" ""Leatherheads"" ""The Ides of March"") to many hes starred in Clooney has evinced a fealty to the classical even old-fashioned kind of film that were so often depressingly reminded Hollywood doesnt make anymore. With ""The Monuments Men"" Clooney looks to the grammar of World War II thrillers caper comedies and standard sentimental uplift to tell the story of the U.S. Armys Monuments Fine Arts and Archives program wherein a group of art historians architects and artists sought to save and preserve artworks looted by the Nazis during the war. Rather than a ragtag team of misfits and rejects these were gentlemen and scholars tasked with preventing Adolf Hitler from amassing the masterpieces of Western art for his planned Fuhrer Museum; as the war came to a close their mission shifted to saving those works from destruction -- or confiscation by the Soviet army which intended to abscond with them as early reparations. Its a pip of a story and Clooney cuts a dashing Gable-esque figure as the groups leader Frank Stokes (based on real-life Monuments Man George Stout) who rounds up a group of bookish out-of-shape academics and professionals sends them to basic training and sets them loose amid the wreckage of Normandy St. Lo and the Bulge. ""The Monuments Men"" which Clooney wrote with producing partner Grant Heslov starts out with funereal solemnity -- gunshots accompanying close-ups of a fine 15th-century painting turn out to be nails being struck while the Ghent Altarpiece is dismantled and spirited away for safekeeping. But soon enough the mood turns jaunty as Stokess men fan out across the charred countryside to save what Stokes calls in one of several why-we-fight speeches ""our culture and way of life."" These tonal shifts bedevil the rest of ""The Monuments Men"" which despite its absorbing story never quite hits its stride either as a stylish wartime thriller (of which John Frankenheimers similarly themed ""The Train"" will forever be the epitome) or jocular lark (""Oceans Altarpiece"" anyone?). Ever the shrewd captain Clooney has assembled his own cast of men who are monuments John Goodman Matt Damon Bill Murray Bob Balaban Hugh Bonneville and ""The Artists"" Jean Dujardin play the team members with an assist from Cate Blanchett as a woman working in Pariss Jeu De Paume museum. The groups most poignant figure a Jewish soldier from New Jersey who harbors a special connection to a particular Rembrandt painting is played by the least well-known cast member Dimitri Leonidis. (His character is based on former infantryman Harry Ettlinger who also appears in the book by Robert Edsel from which ""The Monuments Men"" was adapted.) All too soon this promising ensemble breaks into dyads that go their separate ways resulting in a film that often feels like an anthology of small buddy comedies that never quite jell. (Murray and Balaban come closest to developing genuine chemistry especially during an affecting moment set to the melancholy ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."") Just when one team begins to get a scheme off the ground the film shifts gear and locale to check in with someone else sometimes introducing a note of grim comedy. But lest the audience be tempted to think ""The Monuments Men"" is going the way of ""The Dirty Dozen"" and its rough-and-tumble peers Clooney is always on hand to deliver yet another stirring sermon on art-with-a-capital-A and why its not just important but worth risking life and limb for. Sam Epstein John Goodman George Clooney Matt Damon and Bob Balaban star in director/writer Clooneys earnest ""The Monuments Men."" (Claudette Barius) Thats a lot of moving parts to keep in balance and ""The Monuments Men"" often lets the schematic gears show succumbing to threadbare formula and sentimental cliches rather than taut sophisticated drama. Clooney finally works up a convincing degree of tension once Stokes and his men face multiplying hurdles in their race against the clock the Nazis and the Soviets. And he does a commendable job of ensuring that the context meaning and all-too-real human stakes of the search are never far from mind Among the most moving scenes in ""The Monuments Men"" is one in which Damons character -- a wholesome art restorer named James Granger -- hangs up a lone portrait that hes managed to recover in the barren apartment of its Jewish owner as if one painting can stem an incalculable tide of devastation and loss. Later Clooney juxtaposes a shot of a burned Picasso with a barrelful of human gold-capped teeth. Those moments lend heft to what is otherwise a stolid modestly entertaining drama about an eminently deserving moment in history. ""The Monuments Men"" looks terrific with cinematographer Phedon Papamichael shooting the mostly German locations with a lovely desaturated patina. The film exists in a heightened netherworld between immersive realism and carefully set-dressed theatricality. If Clooney and Heslov feel the need to underline to a fault their points about the sanctity of Western culture and society and way of life and if ""The Monuments Men"" never overcomes its unwieldy structure and unevenness of tone the film still manages to make a profound even subtle point that Hitlers darkest impulses and annihilating reach extended from human beings to history itself. ""The Monuments Men"" drives that startling truth home imperfectly but with chilling clarity.   1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains images of smoking and wartime violence. 119 minutes. goingoutguide true Please provide a valid email address.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Dont go to ""The Monuments Men"" expecting to see a flippant WWII ""Oceans Fourteen."" Its deliciously entertaining but deeper than that. Though George Clooney is leading an all-star crew through a daring heist -- rescuing occupied Europes greatest art treasures from the Nazis -- this is a sturdy old-school big-scale Greatest Generation war movie. Its great escapism. The unlikely story is about true-life heroism not irony. Its frequently funny yet earnest at heart. Directing starring and co-writing Clooney honors unheralded men who made a crucial contribution to the war for civilization. Its a story about men risking lives to save Western cultures greatest achievements from brutes who saw books and timeless art as tinder and kindling. The stakes are clear from the opening scene with Da Vincis wall mural ""The Last Supper"" near collapse after an Allied bombing raid on Milan in 1943 reduced the refectory housing it to rubble. ""The Monuments Men"" follows the fictional characters of art conservationist Frank Stokes (Clooney) and museum director James Granger (Matt Damon) as they recruit a half-dozen artists and experts to preserve masterworks. The squad includes Bill Murray as an architect John Goodman as a sculptor Bob Balaban as a theater impresario and Jean Dujardin as a French resistance fighter. Theyre an odd lot gifted and flawed and they dont always get along with each other or their pragmatic GI counterparts. The film doesnt squander a lot of time building background stories for them. With iconic faces and talents like these thats unnecessary. Goodman conveys more with the twitch of an eye than pages of dialogue can tell and the comic friction between Murray and Balaban is as sly as anything in a Christopher Guest movie. These actors have a sense of identity from the get-go. The film looks stupendous with Normandy Beach Paris snow-covered Belgian forests castles and cathedrals gloriously photographed by Phedon Papamichael. The olive drab and gray of the military equipment and uniforms offer a striking contrast to the beautiful jewel tones of the art on display. Columbia Pictures George Clooney John Goodman Bob Balaban and Matt Damon play men on a dangerous mission to prevent theft and destruction of masterpieces during World War II. Most of the artwork in peril features religious subject matter a canny choice on Clooneys part. Its shorthand for the way art inspires and enriches our daily lives and for most viewers it carries deeper emotional associations than secular works by Vermeer or Rembrandt. Cate Blanchett throbs with suppressed rage as a Paris curator forced into cooperation with Nazi art looters. Shed be executed on the spot if they realized she was secretly cataloging the destinations of national treasures being carted away for display in Hitlers proposed Fuhrer Museum. To recapture that beauty -- there are worse reasons to risk your life. Her ardor helps convince even skeptics that theres more than canvas and paint and chiseled stone at stake here. The film is episodic and it could have been stronger with a centerpiece conflict between the old out-of-shape scholars and a nemesis. Even so its strong work with a sense of the capricious ebb and flow of history. The offhand way the squad learns that the war has ended is a delightful throwaway. The films emotional peak hits at a time and in a way youre unprepared for. While a medic (played by Clooneys co-writer Grant Heslov) works on a gravely wounded soldier Murray hears a homemade recording of his grandchildren singing ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" over the camp PA system. At moments like that and during the touching cameo appearance by Clooneys father Nick you know youre watching one straight from the heart. And thats right where it hits you. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""The Monuments Men"" director George Clooney and his co-writer Grant Heslov admit they were on a mission to shake off the cynicism of their prior films -- chiefly ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and ""The Ides of March"" -- with their ensemble flick. Taking their cue from Robert Edsels 2009 nonfiction book of the same name the pair wanted to give a lesser-known aspect of World War II -- the work of the Monuments Fine Arts and Archives group -- an optimistic upbeat old-fashioned Hollywood shine. Theyve done that perhaps a bit too well. ""The Monuments Men"" is oddly breezy and maybe a bit too self-satisfied as it recounts the story of the men (and woman) responsible for hunting down many of the cultural treasures stolen by the Nazis prior to and during the war. To get a sense of the pillaging consider this One of the hiding places was the salt mine at Altaussee Austria. When discovered it contained 6577 paintings 230 drawings or watercolors 137 sculptures 122 tapestries and over 1200 cases of rare books. For their part the people in the group were older than the Allied soldiers. They had careers were married with children. They were accomplished in their fields as artists curators architects. Think of them as Inglorious Art Historians. Only this PG-13 entertainment has little of the edge however complicated of Quentin Tarantinos 2009 Holocaust revenge flick. Its a high-wattage affair with Clooney taking the role of Frank Stokes based on George Stout art conservationist at Harvards Fogg Museum. Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman Jean Dujardin Bob Balaban and Hugh Bonneville were also influenced by real people. As was Cate Blanchetts Claire Simone. Modeled on Rose Valland the prim prickly Frenchwoman works in the gallery that became the makeshift sorting station for the bounty before it was sent west. Its one of those omnibus casts (not unlike that in the Clooney-Brad Pitt ""Oceans"" romps) that threaten to swamp the films more nuanced ambitions. Sensing this may be why Clooney makes assembling the Monuments team feel hurried. It also may be why its the lesser- known performers that give the story its real texture. Bonneville plays Donald Jeffries a recovering alcoholic who travels to Bruges Belgium in hopes of protecting Michelangelos Madonna and redeeming himself. With his soft features curly hair and sensuous mouth Dimitri Leonidas portrays Sam Epstein a nice Jersey Jewish youngster by way of Germany. Hes based on Harry Ett-linger whose family had a storied centuries-long relationship to the Southwestern city of Karlruhe. In the forward to his book Edsel explains why he chose to whittle down the story of an organization of more than 300 (from 13 nations) to the saga of seven men (all but two American). Edsel allowed himself a bit of literary freedom. ""Ive taken the liberty of creating dialogue for continuity but in no instance does it concern matters of substance"" he writes. Clooney and Heslov take that cinematic license a bit further. The pair changed the names of the characters written about in Edsels tome but also took the opportunity to create men with flaws to fashion arcs that come with more dramatic if cliched tension. As Stokes Clooney works a bit too hard in a few scenes to argue the films central point the importance of art for humankind. Of course we understand why he feels the need to expend so much effort. The cost in lives on the battlefield hitched to the evil of a vast genocide seems to demand defensiveness from anyone speaking for painting and sculpture and antiquities. As if speaking for human bodies and artworks is at cross-purposes. Adolf Hitler had plans for the loot. He envisioned a museum -- the Gemaldegalerie Linz or Fuhrermuseum -- packed with the artworks. Lover of art that he was he also issued a decree that ordered the wholesale destruction of the works if he were to die. It was called the Nero Decree.

By Peter Rainer Film critic February 7 2014 Save for later Saved The Monuments Men stars Matt Damon (l.) and Cate Blanchett (r.). Claudette Barius/Sony Pictures Publicity/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of As ""The Monuments Men"" plodded along I kept asking myself why a movie with such a great subject with such a good cast was so lackluster. Based as they say on a true story (the source material is a book by Robert M. Edsel) its about a cadre of art historians sculptors theater impresarios and restorers who served the Allied cause by rescuing stolen masterpieces from the Nazis in the waning days of World War II.Heading up the team is Frank Stokes played by George Clooney who also directed and co-wrote the script (with Grant Heslov). Along for the mission are men played by Bill Murray Jean Dujardin Bob Balaban John Goodman Hugh Bonneville and Matt Damon. Since none of these men are striplings much wheezy humor is expended on how unschooled they are in the ways of war. Its like an over-the-hill gang variant on ""The Dirty Dozen"" except not as much fun as that sounds.The central question posed by the movie over and over again is Should anyone risk his or her own life or the lives of others trying to save a masterpiece? The answer here appears to be a qualified ""yes."" Frank makes puffed up pronouncements to F.D.R. about how ""art is the very foundation of modern society."" I would have felt better hearing this if the filmmakers had shown a bit more reverence for the great art they so meagerly place on display. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Cate Blanchett complete with cutting-edge French accent turns up as Claire Simone based on the real-life art curator for Pariss Jeu de Paume museum. Suspicious at first of the Monuments Men she warms to Damons James Granger even giving him a fancy tie as an enticement for some ooh-la-la. Claire spends most of the movie looking gaunt and drab - a dead giveaway that there will come a scene when she unlooses her hair ditches the uncomely specs and wears lipstick and bright colors. She is after all French. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Hot tip A much better movie dealing with a similar scenario is John Frankenheimers 1964 ""The Train"" starring Burt Lancaster about the French Resistance hijacking a shipment of Germany-bound art treasures.

And if so why? Its a tricky question and one whose answer is not necessarily obvious. Indeed Im not entirely sure I know the answer Most of us would feel that rescuing a Michelangelo was somehow important in the abstract but very few of us would sacrifice our lives or our families to do it. George Clooney alleged Renaissance man and undoubted paragon of decency and masculinity is clearly troubled by this question in his dull but genial World War II adventure film ""The Monuments Men"" since it comes up over and over again. But he never figures out the right way to ask it let alone answer it.""The Monuments Men"" can offer only dutiful cliches about cultural patrimony most often delivered by the mustachioed Clooney himself in his boring-est mode as art historian turned soldier Frank Stokes. Whereas the real story of the United States Armys art experts and their last-ditch scramble across Europe to find looted masterpieces before the Germans burned them or the Russians stole them is fascinating. It raises all kinds of thorny issues about how we determine cultural value whether works of art are more than commodities and the nature of the changed relationship between Europe and America after 1945.Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslovs script only glances off the question of what kinds of art the Nazis wanted and why -- they burned Picasso and Paul Klee but wanted the Old Masters for Hitlers ginormous never-built ""Fuhrer Museum"" in Linz -- and indeed ""The Monuments Men"" exhibits a bizarre lack of feeling for art of any kind. Its almost as if Clooney were so terrified of being ""arty"" that he refused even the obvious middlebrow aesthetics of the situation. If youre going to make a big deal about the Ghent Altarpiece or the Madonna of Bruges you might want to make us feel something about them or at least let us look at them for more than a split-second at a time instead of just pronouncing on their importance.But thats exactly the problem with this movie or at least one of the big ones The altarpiece painted by Jan van Eyck and the Madonna carved by Michelangelo along with the thousands upon thousands of other works hoarded by Nazi leaders in salt mines and Bavarian castles are MacGuffins meaningless plot coupons about as relevant to the movie Clooney has tried to make as the eponymous object is to John Hustons ""The Maltese Falcon."" And while Hustons film is great on its own terms an enduring classic of 1940s hard-boiled crime cinema Clooneys movie is a slow-witted occasionally agreeable retread of numerous WWII band-of-brothers flicks its director no doubt watched on TV as a 1970s teenager. Theres a faint patina of culture and sophistication slathered over the whole thing meant to signify seriousness (like the beard Clooneys character wears at the beginning and end of the movie) without actually achieving it.If you want to understand the real history of the Nazis rapacious desire to devour and reshape all of Europes cultural history turning it into propaganda for their imaginary Thousand-Year Reich -- which was largely driven by the personal ambitions and tastes of failed Vienna art student and landscape painter Adolf Hitler -- youre better off with the excellent 2006 documentary ""The Rape of Europa."" If you want a World War II movie this one probably doesnt rank in the top 200. On the other hand if you want a low-wattage ""Oceans Eleven"" knockoff with an A-list cast of middle-aged dudes -- Clooney Matt Damon Bill Murray and John Goodman with Jean Dujardin thrown in for some notional continental sex appeal -- transported a few decades back in time and bumbling around Europe in Jeeps I guess youve come to the right place. You Might Also Like ""The Monuments Men"" is an especially frustrating experience because you can see traces here and there of the more serious and resonant film about second chances and middle-aged melancholy that Clooney may once have believed he was making. Theres a lovely scene with Bill Murray standing in the shower at a frozen encampment near the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944 listening to a phonograph record of his daughter and grandkids singing ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" from back in Whereverville. (It has nothing to do with the plot and may only be in the movie because the original release date was in December.) Theres also an unforgettable moment when all the surviving monuments men take a slow and silent elevator ride together out of a German salt mine where theyve discovered a trove of stolen art. They also found a barrel of gold in that mine -- a barrel of gold teeth -- and you can feel them trying to reckon with that horrible new understanding.But a strikingly large percentage of this movie is neither interesting as history nor entertaining as drama. You get the feeling that Clooney is sticking too closely to the facts to have any fun but is fundamentally uninterested in the story the facts have to tell. Stokes becomes personally invested in recovering the Bruges Madonna and the Ghent Altarpiece before the Red Army does but his reasons seem irrelevant and sentimental. Matt Damons character a Metropolitan Museum curator named Granger spends the latter portion of the war in Paris speaking bad French (a running unfunny gag) and trying to pry information out of a bespectacled Cate Blanchett while being too much of an upright American to sleep with her. I cant tell you the first thing about the characters Goodman and Murray are playing; theyre the ""John Goodman guy"" and the ""Bill Murray guy."" Dujardin plays the French guy. Hugh Bonneville of ""Downton Abbey"" is in the group for a minute as the drunken Englishman and then theres Bob Balaban who as always is in his element building a funny character out of nothing in particular. Weve officially reached the point of diminishing returns in the career of George Clooney movie director which began in such a weird and unexpected way with ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" with Sam Rockwell as deranged talk-show host and alleged CIA agent Chuck Barris. Nothing hes made since has been half that audacious or quite that good ""Good Night and Good Luck"" was earnest artful and even inspiring with a terrific cast headed by David Strathairn and ""The Ides of March"" was about two-thirds of a great political thriller with lots of nice actorly moments (from Paul Giamatti from Philip Seymour Hoffman from Clooney himself) that didnt entirely cohere. Im going to pretend his 1920s football rom-com ""Leatherheads"" did not happen.Here we see Clooney deliberately steering away from political or ""liberal"" subject matter and trying to make an old-fashioned studio movie thats nostalgic patriotic and fun. The result is a near-total face-plant. I guess ""The Monuments Men"" is not quite dire enough to make anybodys list of all-time flops but its close. It surely wont be profitable and even the best-loved man in Hollywood cannot have enjoyed seeing his project yanked out of the fall Oscar season and dumped in the frozen wasteland of February. I still think the guy can probably make movies (though Im a whole lot less sure about that than I used to be) but only if he stops trying to be a canny strategic people-pleaser and figures out whether he has something to say.

I wonder if Richard actually watched some of the movies he reviews. Seems like you could write a review like this by browsing other peoples articles and reviews. Recommending that people spend their hard-earned money and 2 hours of their life on this uneventful slop is a sin.

"Those Hollywood Dumpuary Blues << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The Last Skate Atelier  Next A Visit From the Goon Squad Facebook Twitter Print Movies Those Hollywood Dumpuary Blues One great doc cant stop the fall of Monuments Men or the cynicism of The Lego Movie by Wesley Morris on February 7 2014 Theres an audience for The Monuments Men. Its a WWII drama in which George Clooney assembles a team of curators historians and museum directors turns them into soldiers and devises a plan to stop the Nazis from stealing Europes great art. Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman and Bob Balaban play the art experts. So do Jean Dujardin of The Artist and Hugh Bonneville of Downton Abbey. Cate Blanchett makes long faces as a Parisian conscripted into doing clerical work for the SS. Clooney directed and cowrote this movie with his creative partner Grant Heslov. (Its based on a real years-long mission -- the Monuments Fine Arts and Archives program -- that Robert M. Edsel documented in a pair of books about purloined treasure during the war.) Clooney applies an unflagging chumminess to nearly every scene. Its the war film his astronaut from Gravity would have made. The camaraderie is played for gentle laughs. The score by Alexandre Desplat imitates the music in old Hollywood battle pictures -- woodwinds pip brasses gleam tubas fart. When Clooneys character Frank Stokes a dashing conservator delivers a speech about the crux of the operation -- to save the soul of civilization -- a piano twinkles behind him. The whole movie has an unbearable lightness. As I said theres an audience for this movie. But that audience lives in 1964. That might strike some moviegoers as complimentary. It might flatter Clooney too. Hes directed five films. This one is the spiritual twin of his 2008 football screwball Leatherheads -- both strive to embody bygone entertainment just not artisanally. These arent vintage re-creations the way youd get with a younger director who just discovered say The Dirty Dozen. Theyre not the explosive revisions of Quentin Tarantino either. With Clooney these throwbacks arent out to unpack antique craftsmanship or correct long-standing thematic problems. With him its The Dirty Dozen with even less dirt. The film spans more than two years from the winter of 1943 to the spring of 1945. Yet whenever a new time card stamps the screen youre forced to ask where all those months went. Because descriptive filmmaking doesnt come easily to Clooney the characters actually have to explain everything. The men make their way around Europe in search of a couple of key pieces including Michelangelos Madonna of Bruges. But Clooney doesnt attach to the art any personal meaning or wonder. That sort of melodrama is beside the point to him. Or maybe its been forced to seem beside the point. I cant think of another movie that feels as simultaneously rushed and leisurely. There are three good sequences -- one in a clearing with Goodman Dujardin and a horse; another with Murray and Balaban experiencing a stroke of luck in a farmhouse; the third puts one of the men on a land mine. The first two could have been elevated to greatness with some patience just playing out the rhythm to enrich the suspense. That third sequence is perfect as it is yet by the time it happens all the jolliness and sense of moral purpose have drained the movie of real tension. The Monuments Men feels like the intersection of The Good German and the three Oceans capers all of which Steven Soderbergh directed all of which feature Clooney. This is a film that could have used a little of Soderberghs chilliness to cut the mirth. Warren Beatty is the actor who produces and directs to whom Clooney has often been compared. Theyre both liberals whose movies veer between politics and old-Hollywood fluff -- two of Clooneys other dramas were about Edward R. Murrow and a juicy presidential campaign. But Beattys grip on a genre was sure enough for him to riff on it. I think Clooney sees filmmaking as an opportunity to wag his finger -- at philistines at the past at the present. Theres some subversion in that approach. Entertainment runs a distant second to point making. He seemed to know that the campaign movie of his The Ides of March from 2011 was trash. The trash is what some of us wanted but he was ultimately too tasteful to dignify our lust. He tried to shame politics and us. Thats the frustration with Clooney. His father Nick is a journalist film historian and politician. As a director Clooney flatters his father who plays an older version of Stokes briefly toward the end. The apples still hanging on the tree. Its not for nothing that Clooney has cast himself as the conservator in The Monuments Men. Hes making the sort of movie no one makes anymore. Hes the keeper of several flames. But in doing so hes thinking past the audience and into Senate hearings and Festschrifts. Hes rigorously wow-averse. His films dramatize the distance between confidence and certitude and how the latter denies any possibility of true levity or surprise. The Murrow movie 2005s Good Night and Good Luck worked more or less because its moralizing came from the mouth of a moralist. It was resonant ventriloquism. Still you never exit a George Clooney film satisfied that youve watched a movie. You go home feeling like youve just signed a petition. The Monuments Men had been placed on last years holiday schedule and was moved off the Hollywood version of benching a star player. Seeing it now you understand why. Sometimes a perfectly competent film simply doesnt come together in that alchemical way that a merely good movie needs to. Nothing blooms. This is the historical movie I think people feared Ben Afflecks Argo would be fine scenes that dont add up. Part of the enthusiasm for the film had to do with the surprise (and relief) that Affleck whos really the modern Beatty had pulled it off. Something bloomed. Thats a cosmic-industrial reason for how The Monuments Men has been handled. Theres also the simple reality that Clooney and Heslov have misguided the movie to almost ideological ends. This is essentially an action-adventure film. But Clooney plays it as a tract. Once again hes appealing to our better selves with a work of classicism. But the trouble with his ideas of the classics is that they dont feel as if hes learning anything. Hes lecturing. The Monuments Men actually opens and closes with Clooney behind a lectern pointing to images on a screen. That captures the George Clooney moviegoing experience. Leave the popcorn. Bring a notebook.  It seems almost unfair to open a WWII trifle like The Monuments Men which is careful to graze the particulars of the Holocaust in the same week a new Claude Lanzmann documentary arrives. But The Last of the Unjust has begun making its way around the country with its nearly four-hour running time; outrageously compelling subject Benjamin Murmelstein; and tour de force discourse. Murmelstein was an Austrian Jew forced by Adolf Eichmann into the terrible assignment of helping run the Theresienstadt Ghetto. In 1975 Lanzmann met with Murmelstein for a series of interviews that went mostly unused for his Holocaust landmark Shoah. The nest of moral and ethical questions raised by Murmelsteins role at the camp warrants the full Lanzmann treatment. I wrote about the film last spring and my feelings about it havent changed. It still has an inexorable force. Murmelstein meanwhile proves a vexing encryption of a man even to a master prosecutor like Lanzmann. The central debates about culpability and betrayal are riveting wearing and finally depressing. Clooneys movie searches ruins looking for art. Lanzmanns art arises from scouring adjacent atrocity in pursuit of answers. His documentary doesnt deserve an audience so much as demand one.  When does an animated family movie have to surrender to the realities of family entertainment? Can it be too cool for its own good? I thought about that while watching The Lego Movie. By family standards it is first an epic of sorts. The films been made to seem as if it were built entirely of Lego blocks and pieces. The simulation mixes computer animation a kind of stop-motion and what appears to be the painstaking manual labor of working with actual Legos. And the effects occasionally produce magic -- like whenever water and suds run they gush as tiny Lego bricks. Often though the simulation just seems well simulated. But the film itself has the archness of something aimed at people predisposed to despise a smart fitfully earnest movie like Frozen. Cynicism drives The Lego Movie. It focuses on a himbo construction worker named Emmet (Chris Pratt) whos mistaken as a savior akin to Neo in The Matrix. Emmets dragged all over Lego Land by a questing punk named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and a holy Moses called Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) just like the ancient Roman architect. Theyre joined by a split-personality Hello Kitty-like cat (Alison Brie) a goofball spaceman (Charlie Day) and a pirate (Nick Offerman) operating what could be a Jaeger from Pacific Rim. Theyre all trying to stop an egomaniacal CEO from taking over the world. Hes a suit on stilts called President Business. His voice belongs to Will Ferrell and the red tie and wooden manner would seem to belong to Mitt Romney. His henchman is another dual personality played by Liam Neeson. They all move with the blockish gracelessness you expect from a Lego figurine. The directors are Phil Lord and Christopher Miller the pair responsible for the shocking hilarity of the 21 Jump Street movie. I laughed at this movie too. Freeman and Neeson find their respective self-parody sweet spots and the whole thing is almost stolen by a narcissistic Batman played by Will Arnett with his voice scraping the earth. But I got tired of laughing which never happened with 21 Jump Street. It wasnt the idea of a studio raiding its vault for satire (most of the fictional references Ive mentioned are Warner Bros. properties even loosely Hello Kitty). It wasnt the idea that the movie is just a commercial for Legos though I did think seriously more than once about how fun it might be to build myself a city some weekend. I stopped laughing because after 20 minutes Id had enough. The conceit gets stale fast. If Michel Gondrys all-Lego music video for the White Stripes ""Fell in Love With a Girl"" had lasted 100 minutes the tidal wave of joy you get from that clip would dissipate and all you would be is wet. Id had enough of the cynicism too. The movie wants to mock adventure movies and cartoons and disrespect family movies with ""whatever dude"" cool Emmet is an almost self-admitted idiot whos happier being a drone. You sense that Lord and Miller want to make another piece of gonzo vulgarity something ironically riotously lewd like Trey Parker and Matt Stones all-marionette Team America World Police. But The Lego Movie is as far as the studio would allow them to go. Any real anarchy actually feels suppressed. So you doubt its sincerity. Once the film breaks into a long would-be climactic live-action interlude with Ferrell as a neglectful dad I threw my hands up. Emmet tells Wyldstyle ""I never have any ideas."" Lord and Miller run out of fresh ones fast.  It does of course feel churlish to complain about an animated movie this physically ambitious and fun (while it lasts) when something as dreary and heartless as The Nut Job is out there. This movie purports to be a caper adventure featuring park rodents trying to steal sacks of nuts from human gangsters. The whole thing looks like a video game youd rather not play. There are poor nut puns an idiot bulldog and two heists that take too long to execute. Theres also a curiously erotic moment in which the hero -- a sour selfish squirrel (Arnett again) -- stops pushing away his mute rat friend and makes unexplained eye contact with him for several long seconds. Some other characters break up the moment and the squirrel pushes the rat out of the frame. Thats not even subtext. I saw The Nut Job with a 5-year-old whos newly obsessed with giving his food and movies star ratings. He spent the walk home wondering aloud why the gangsters were shooting guns and why the movie ended with a cartoon Psy doing ""Gangnam Style"" over the closing credits. For a child that is the musical equivalent of putting bacon on a manure sandwich. ""Two stars"" cried my 5-year-old friend. How this movie happened at all is far more perplexing than the failure of Clooneys movie. With animated childrens entertainment weve reached a point at which quality might not matter at all. If you can keep the price tag down (The Nut Job has already grossed more than its reported 42 million budget) theres money to be made no matter how junky and derivative it is. Even the voice work is miserable. Neeson villainous again joins Arnett and a miscast Katherine Heigl. Arnett and Neeson sound as if theyre having the time of their lives in The Lego Movie. Here they sound like they want to hide. They should.

The Monuments Men (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Monuments Men (PG-13) George Clooneys sluggish World War II adventure based on true events. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com2/6/2014 Editor rating 2 In The Monuments Men director George Clooney takes a wild stranger-than-fiction true story and turns it into a dull prestigious slog. The fact that the movie opens and closes with lectures complete with slideshow presentations is not an accident. Clooney is an erratic director -- his previous four films Confessions of a Dangerous Mind Good Night and Good Luck Leatherheads and The Ides of March were all over the place -- and although he seems to favor a classical old-school approach to narrative hes not much for generating suspense and excitement two things this movie badly needs. Loosely based on the book by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter the movie follows the efforts of art curator Frank Stokes (Clooney) to round up a different kind of Oceans 11 -- an art restorer (Matt Damon) an architect (Bill Murray) a painter (Jean Dujardin) a sculptor (John Goodman) a museum curator (Hugh Bonneville) and a theater producer (Bob Balaban) -- then go through a quick round of boot camp in England before heading out to the front lines in France in 1944 to recover priceless works of art stolen by the Nazis. Hitler is collecting as many masterpieces as he can to fill his proposed Fuehrermuseum. But Stokes who argues that art is part of our world history is intent on not letting that happen. The Monuments Men has a few good moments such as the awkward unspoken romance between Damon and a French secretary (Cate Blanchett) who has learned to trust no one or a scene in which Balaban finds a record player so Murray can listen to the holiday greetings his family has sent him back home. But too little of the movie confronts the question at the forefront of the viewers mind -- with all the atrocities that took place during the war could the loss of life for protecting a statue be justified? -- and Clooney refuses to give in to the adventure underpinnings of the material keeping the pace at a genteel second gear. When characters die you barely feel anything. The movie hasnt given you much of a reason to care for any of them. The Monuments Men is so stiff it manages to make even the wild-man Murray boring. Hes so well-behaved and proper he and the milquetoast  Balaban could have switched roles and no one would have noticed.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 07 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 07 2014 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by George Clooney Written by George Clooney and Grant Heslov Starring George Clooney John Goodman Jean DuJardin Matt Damon Bill Murray Bob Balaban and Cate Blanchett Country USA Language English After an impressive batting average as a producer (Argo Syriana) star (Up in the Air) and director (Good Night and Good Luck The Ides of March) George Clooney takes a swing and misses with The Monuments Men in which he serves as co-writer director and star. This ambitious drama follows a team of middle-aged art experts sent to Europe in the last years of the Second World War to attempt to rescue and return millions of pieces of priceless artworks from Nazi hands. Based on the non-fiction book by Robert Edsel the story of these bookish types and curators joining the American army following the German armys retreat is a fascinating one but the high-minded message about preserving Western civilization often feels at odds with the movies half-hearted heist-flick approach. From stock wartime scenes to Alexandre Desplats generic score Clooneys film is a hybrid of a war-movie homage (The Great Escape The Guns of Navarone) and one of the star-studded Oceans Eleven caper flicks. By the films end one cant help thinking that the story would be better served by a well-researched documentary on the real-life MFAA division (monuments fine arts and archives.) Clooney plays the ringleader Frank Stokes (based on the real-life art conservationist George Stout) who in 1944 gets the go-ahead from Franklin Delano Roosevelt (heard but not seen) to assemble a team to advise commanders on the front and try to retrieve the millions of artworks which Hitler had taken for his planned Fuhrermuseum in his hometown of Linz Austria.The team includes New York art curator James Granger (Matt Damon) architect Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) sculptor Walter Garfield (John Goodman) a French art instructor and dealer Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) historian Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) and British academic and recovering alcoholic Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville). Along with the seven art experts is a Jewish-German youngster named Sam (Dimitri Leonidas) whos on hand to translate and drive.Once introduced though these characters are barely developed and for a gang of aesthetic eggheads the Monuments Men show surprisingly little interest in art or culture as they quip their way across Europe. Nor is their expertise ever called for beyond basic literacy In one scene Balabans character recognizes a paintings source is a certain collection because the name ""Rothschild"" is written on the back; in another a frame bears the name ""Pablo Picasso.""Although two artworks get some particular attention - Michelangelos sculpture Madonna of Bruges and the 15th-century Ghent Altarpiece by Hubert and Jan van Eyck - most of the time Stokess morale-building speeches stick to Western arts greatest hits ""Who will make sure the statue of David is still standing the Mona Lisa still smiling?"" he asks.Ultimately The Monuments Men would have to be a lot more or a lot less reverent to have the impact Clooney intended. Instead of one major heist we have a series of encounters big and little discoveries and a lot of familiar war-movie moments. Theres some strained comic play between Balabans fusspot historian and Murrays laid-back architect and a long sequence thats the equivalent of the old letter from home That comes with an extended sentimental scene when Murrays character listens to a home recording of his granddaughter singing the Judy Garland hit Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. As well Damons character is saddled with a running gag about his bad French (rendered in fractured subtitle) and a romantic subplot with a prim French curator (a disappointingly stilted Cate Blanchett) who somehow falls for the unsophisticated Yankee.In the end the lofty speeches about art and the familiar war scenes simply dont deliver insight or emotional punch. While Clooneys script raises the serious question of whether any work of art is worth a human life The Monuments Men does nothing dramatically to make the question compelling.

Claudette Barius/Courtesy of Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Claudette Barius/Courtesy of Columbia Pictures The Monuments Men Directors George Clooney Genre Action Drama Running time 118 minutes Rated PG-13 for some images of war violence and historical smoking With George Clooney Matt Damon Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett Theres a fascinating tale to be told in The Monuments Men George Clooneys new film based on the true story of a search for looted art stolen by the Nazis during World War II. In real life with fighting still raging on the battlefields of Europe a small team of art experts searched urgently for tens of thousands of missing paintings and sculptures. The movies audience will search for something a little different. Its the spring of 1944 when middle-aged museum curator George Clooney tells middle-aged art restorer Matt Damon that hes got the go-ahead from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to head for the Continent. The only catch Hes got to go as an enlisted man with everything that entails. Damons character is skeptical. ""You want to go into a war zone and tell our boys what they can and cannot blow up?"" Thats the idea hes told -- though commanders on the front wont be terribly sympatico when they get there. Hes even more skeptical about the notion of their joining a whole cultural-over-the-hill-gang in basic training. And when we meet the gang its evident why. Theres a disgraced museum director straight from Downton Abbey (Hugh Bonneville) an artist straight from The Artist (Jean Dujardin) a bickering odd couple of nonartist hangers-on (Bill Murray and Bob Balaban) and a sculptor (John Goodman) who drags himself through a basic-training obstacle course with cheerful abandon assuming erroneously that the teenagers firing just over his head are shooting blanks. You neednt worry for a while though because Clooney not only acts in and directs this high-spirited little epic -- which seems to want to be the best World War II movie of 1963 -- but he also co-scripted and he has a lot to get off his chest before anything much can happen. Get off his chest not in dialogue exactly but in speeches -- patriotic (""We must and will win this war"") noble (""Were fighting for a culture and a way of life"") expository (""Its not random its systematic; every one of those paintings is a masterpiece"") lofty (""Remember the high price thatll be paid if the very foundation of modern society is destroyed"") and philosophical (""You can wipe out a generation of people you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow theyll come back but if you destroy their achievements their history its as if they never existed""). Im guessing audiences would get the point without all the pointing but credit the director-star-producer-co-writer with making a film that almost no one else in Hollywood could have gotten made. And credit his buddies for being good sports in it. Damon for instance isnt so much playing a part as playing a walking bad French joke whos mocked by Cate Blanchett in an Australian-French accent. (The crust) Thing is though theyre all working hard to liven-up what turns out to be a surprisingly lackadaisical race against time. Theres lots of information some nice images plenty of earnest sermonizing about culture and almost no suspense or tension or character development or structure. Or well art.

Photo Credit AP / Claudette Barius advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT During World War II several art experts join the Army to track down masterpieces stolen by the Nazis. Based on a true story. Rated PG-13 (language mild violence) BOTTOM LINE Rich with historical details low on excitement and romance. Still the attractive cast and European backdrops make for a pleasant journey. CAST George Clooney Matt Damon Cate Blanchett LENGTH 159 Steven Soderberghs ""Oceans 11"" meets David Leans ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" in George Clooneys ""The Monuments Men."" The combination isnt as intriguing as it sounds. At times this fact-based film feels like a breezy heist flick while at others its a somber tribute to the sacrifices of war. The two tones dont harmonize and they never ring true. Directed and co-written by Clooney (with longtime collaborator Grant Heslov) from a nonfiction book by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter ""The Monuments Men"" is the story of several unlikely soldiers -- all from the genteel art world and well past draft age -- who venture to the front lines of World War II to find art stolen by the Nazis. To the tune of Alexandre Desplats reworked ""Colonel Bogey March"" (made popular by Leans film) dashing art historian Frank Stokes (Clooney) assembles his team. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? They are Metropolitan Museum curator James Granger (Matt Damon); architect Richard Campbell (Bill Murray); sculptor Walter Garfield (John Goodman); Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) and Preston Savitz (an enjoyably dry Bob Balaban) both art experts; and French dealer Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin of ""The Artist""). Add to this excellent cast Cate Blanchett as Claire Simone a Parisienne hiding information on hundreds of missing masterpieces. There are moments of light humor (mostly from odd couple Murray and Balaban) and of poignancy as the men risk their lives for treasures such as Michelangelos Bruges Madonna. But this war-slash-heist film offers precious little excitement barely any suspense and zero romance. ""The Monuments Men"" would seem free to take plenty of dramatic license since none of its characters are real (a few are inspired by historical figures) yet the script never thinks beyond the plausible. The action scenes feel modest the climactic moments small-scale. The film also lacks a villain (aside from a briefly glimpsed Hitler) which leaves our heroes fighting a somewhat abstract battle. ""The Monuments Men"" occasionally makes an eloquent case for the value -- beyond dollars that is -- of great art. Somehow though it lacks the spark that could have made it live and breathe. 228 MoviesMonuments Men trailer PLOT During World War II several art experts join the Army to track down masterpieces stolen by the Nazis.

Besides ""The Monuments Men"" opening today hes helmed four other movies ranging from screwball comedy to political drama. CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND (2002) -- Clooneys directorial debut was this acclaimed story of game-show producer Chuck Barris alleged double life as a CIA agent. Clooney knew well how to re-create those game-show sequences -- he often visited the sets of the game shows his dad Nick Clooney directed and hosted in the 70s. GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK (2005) -- Journalist Edward R. Murrows stand against Communist-hunting Sen. Joseph McCarthy earned Clooney Oscar nominations for his moody black-and-white direction and the screenplay. CelebritiesHottest celebs over 50 LEATHERHEADS (2008) -- Clooney directed and starred as a football hero in the Roaring 20s trying to turn his team from zeros to heroes. He watched lots of classic screwball comedies as research for this pigskin parade but it fumbled at the box office. advertisement | advertise on newsday THE IDES OF MARCH (2011) -- Ryan Gosling played a young idealist who learns about dirty politics while working on a presidential hopefuls campaign in this Clooney drama.

And in this fact-based World War II-set drama the Oscar winner crashes as an actor director and cowriter of a woefully lazy script. The lack of ingenuity is obvious from the get-go. Clooney whos grown into quite a versatile actor over the past decade gives himself a role that he could phone in from his living room in Lake Cuomo. As professor Frank Stokes hes simply quintessential Clooney The charismatic and intelligent renegade leader with the gift of gab. Perhaps you might recognize him from his earlier work in ER Oceans Eleven Twelve and Thirteen Up in the Air The Perfect Storm Gravity. . . PHOTOS George and other eligible Hollywood singles In the opening moments he persuades President Roosevelt -- this is 1944 after the invasion of Normandy -- to let him extract the rare sculptures and paintings seized by the Nazis. He rounds up a merry band of art experts in a montage notable only for its familiarity. Yes its fair to say that Danny Ocean has ditched his Las Vegas crew and is heading to Europe with new misfits. Matt Damon is on board along with Bill Murray Hugh Bonneville Bob Balaban Jean Dujardin and John Goodman. Certainly the casting does not disappoint; the actors effort level does. They all sleepwalk through their rote roles hindered by the lack of characteristics differentiating them. Wait thats not quite right. Balaban is the one constantly ribbed because hes an old lightweight. Dujardin has a French accent. (The search party is still looking for Murray and Goodman both last seen mumbling in the woods.) PHOTOS Best movies of 2012 Damon has the most to do which is to say hes stuck with the bulk of the stale dialogue. A running gag about his inability to speak fluent French lands with a thud each time the goofy subtitles flash onscreen. He also strikes up an ill-conceived flirtation with Cate Blanchetts stuffy art curator/resistance leader. Her character belongs in another movie entirely. The platoon recovers the treasures in clunky episodic sequences devoid of energy and suspense. (Does anyone doubt these pros are not going to ultimately unearth the vaunted much-talked-about Madonna statue?) And though two Men die along the way the casualties feel like an afterthought because Clooney never finds the right tone between jaunty caper and Serious War Film. Its obvious to the eyes and the ears. In fact the jolly musical score playing in the background after a scene in which a Nazi threatens violence is borderline offensive. A Nazi PHOTOS Sundance 2014 -- the stars premieres and parties Clooney of course has noble intentions. And he makes sure were all very well aware of this. In voice-overs his character constantly defends the mission droning on and on about the importance of high culture in society. Thats fine. Just dont hold this picture up as an exhibit.

"Review Monuments Men talks big but lacks artful direction - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Monuments Men talks big but lacks artful direction The Monuments Men Talk Clooney Matt Damon and his co-stars in The Monuments Men reveal how they knew George Clooney would be a great director while Clooney himself chats about his love for writing and directing. (Feb. 5) Matt Damon and his co-stars in The Monuments Men reveal how they knew George Clooney would be a great director while Clooney himself chats about his love for writing and directing. (Feb. 5) Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Earnest and well-intentioned but ultimately inert ""The Monuments Men"" talks a better game than it can deliver. Inspired by true tales of World War II derring-do it cant decide what kind of a film it wants to be and so ends up failing across a fairly wide spectrum.This is something of a surprise and not just because the film is directed and co-written by George Clooney who is also top dog in a high-powered cast that includes Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman Jean Dujardin and Cate Blanchett. Rather the films flat-lining is unexpected because the underlying narrative of a small band of American soldiers tasked with protecting the great artworks of Europe from the depredations of German Russian and even U.S. troops not only sounds like it would make a hell of a film in one sense it already has.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TV ""The Rape of Europa"" a 2006 documentary based on Lynn H. Nicholas National Book Critics Circle award-winning work covers some of the same territory as ""Monuments Men"" in such an involving fashion that when I wrote about it I insisted its stories were ""fascinating enough to inspire movies of their own."" Be careful what you wish for.Clooney and his frequent writing partner Grant Heslov were inspired not by my review (thank God) but by the notion of doing a movie in the vein of the World War II dramas of the 1960s and 70s films like ""The Guns of Navarone"" ""The Great Escape"" and ""The Dirty Dozen.""There is nothing wrong with that idea but the execution is so haphazard and erratic that it reminds us that Clooneys directing credits include the clumsy ""Leatherheads"" as well as the dazzling ""Good Night and Good Luck.""The problem here as noted is that ""Monuments Mens"" eyes are bigger than its stomach. In attempting to mix ersatz ""Oceans Eleven"" buddy humor with life-threatening World War II action while doing justice to the true story that underlies it all the film never finds a consistent tone and ends up lacking in all areas. Its the real stuff the film gets to first as we see Belgian priests clandestinely carting off Jan van Eycks irreplaceable Ghent Altarpiece to keep it away from art-hungry German troops engaged in industrial-strength looting of occupied countries.PHOTOS Biggest box office flops of 2013We also go to Paris where Nazis under the direction of no less a personage than Hermann Goering are engaged in systematic plundering of art from Jewish collectors much to the disgust of Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) who seems like a lowly curator but is actually playing a more dangerous game.All this art thievery so upsets top drawer art historian Frank Stokes (Clooney) that he takes a meeting with Franklin D. Roosevelt. By insisting that ""art is the very foundation of modern society"" Stokes persuades the president to start what became known as the Monuments Fine Arts and Archives program. These art-savvy operatives old and out of shape though some of them are get inducted into the Army and are charged with going to the European front and ""protecting whats left finding whats missing.""Though this group of folks eventually numbered 300 to 400 strong ""Monuments Men"" engages in the polite fiction that eight men did it all and in classic ""Seven Samurai"" fashion the film takes us around as Clooney recruits them all from architect Richard Campbell (Murray) to sculptor Walter Garfield (Goodman) and theatrical impresario Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban).The films press notes are careful to indicate that these characters are based on real people but the problem with them is that as written they dont seem real at all even when broken into small groups and sent out on their own adventures. (Matt Damons James Granger is detailed to Paris to attempt to gain a cranky Claire Simones trust and cooperation.)RELATED More movie reviews by The TimesMaking matters worse ""Monuments Mens"" running time is padded with generic episodes that feel like theyre left over from other World War II movies even if theyre not. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery but it does not lead to good films.Also not helping is the scripts creaky bonhomie between a group of individuals who are forever cracking wise. This faux-jaunty dialogue is simply not entertaining and it makes the serious jeopardy these men are occasionally in that much more unconvincing.The only actor who escapes unscathed is Blanchett whose Claire Simon is based on Rose Valland whos been described as one of the most decorated women in French history. Not burdened with glib dialogue Blanchett brings the kind of integrity to her performance that is lacking elsewhere. The best parts of ""Monuments Men"" are the recapitulation of the genuine art-rescuing accomplishments of its protagonists. The real-life monuments men recovered some 5 million pieces of art and if this disappointing film calls any kind of attention to that it will have done at least that much good in the world.kenneth.turanlatimes.com ------------------------------The Monuments MenMPAA rating PG-13 for some images of war violence and historical smokingRunning time 1 hour 58 minutesPlaying In general release.

(The documentary focused on how the Nazis looted Europes great museums and private art collections with the intent of stocking a Third Reich museum.)STORY Clooney clique specializes in retro film styleCAST Monuments stars spill about their prized possessionsMORE Clooney plays the time warp again when he directsREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersThis version of the story comes off like a flat sitcom set amid the horrors of war. The fictionalizing of the platoons specific antics compressing of events and scenes played for broad laughs undercut the poignant heroism of their work. An exception is the moving scene in which British art lover Donald Jeffries (Downton Abbeys Hugh Bonneville) attempts to save Michelangelos Madonna of Bruges.While the cast is impressive the story lacks a strong sense of character development. Everyone comes off like cardboard cutouts rather than fully drawn individuals. A scene in which the men struggle through basic training fizzles in its comic ambitions.Clooney plays ringleader Frank Stokes a Harvard art historian and World War I veteran who persuades President Franklin D. Roosevelt to send in a team of experts to locate and preserve Europes greatest art. The crew includes Americans James Granger (Matt Damon) Richard Campbell (Bill Murrray) Walter Garfield (John Goodman) and Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) as well as Frenchman Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) and German ex-pat Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas). Rounding out the effort is Parisian museum curator Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) who is initially resistant then helps Granger with the recovery.Specifics that differentiate the strengths and key traits of each character are glossed over and sometimes simply ignored.While the story has moments of liveliness and spurts of believable camaraderie among the artistically minded men it is sometimes disjointed and lacking in emotional depth. The incongruously jaunty score by composer Alexandre Desplat undercuts the lofty message of people willing to die to save art.Its a particular disappointment coming from Clooney who as a filmmaker has directed some undeniably smart and nuanced films such as Good Night and Good Luck and The Ides of March.Here he seems torn between approaching the story with a sense of reverence and making it a more mainstream oversimplified entertainment. He settles on a pedestrian perspective and slack pacing does it no favors.Monuments Men is a tribute to unsung heroes. But given its breezy surface-skimming treatment of the subject the audience is unlikely to feel the gravity of their achievements. 27 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1dtVptc",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/02/06/monuments-men-review/4983491/,200,themonumentsmen19,themonumentsmen,usatoday

An unlikely World War II platoon is tasked to rescue art masterpieces from Nazi thieves. Starring George Clooney Matt Damon John Goodman and Bill Murray. (Photo/Video Columbia Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Feb. 6 2014 208 p.m. ET Though the Third Reich is crumbling World War II still rages around the improbable heroes of ""The Monuments Men"" a platoon of art experts sent into Germany by FDR to rescue priceless treasures of Western art before the Nazis can destroy them. The story based on fact is a fascinating one but the conflict here isnt confined to the battlefield. The movies tone is at war with its subject and sometimes with its wavering self. Masterworks of marble and canvas compete with cardboard characters in a jaunty action adventure that stops every now and then for an art-appreciation lecture on the importance of it all. Instead of the Dirty Dozen theres a sophisticated seven played by George Clooney (he directed from a screenplay he wrote with Grant Heslov) Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman Jean Dujardin Bob Balaban and Hugh Bonneville. This ragtag military unit comprises museum directors curators and art historians whove gone through a jokey version of basic training before taking up sidearms and rifles and tracking down Michelangelos ""Bruges Madonna"" and the ""Ghent Altarpiece"" among other vanished objets. What a cast but also what a waste since the action part proves to be as synthetic as the art part. The only actor whos found a consistently dramatic tone is Cate Blanchett in a small but crucial role as a Parisian working at the Jeu de Paume museum next door to the Louvre. She uses a fake French accent that is beautifully and authentically fake in the tradition of Hollywood war films ""The Monuments Men"" seeks to emulate. ENLARGE Cate Blanchett listens in to a conversation from her desk in The Monuments Men. Columbia Pictures War films that is with tightly focused missions like ""The Guns of Navarone"" or ""The Heroes of Telemark."" But they took themselves quite earnestly and were received in the same spirit; no need for repeated lectures on the importance of destroying a huge German gun emplacement or the crucial component of a German atom bomb. ""The Monuments Men"" which was based on a lively but essentially serious book written by Robert M. Edsel with Bret Witter represents a fundamental mismatch between style and substance. The movie sends its citizen-soldiers off on their deeply serious mission with mock-martial music and snare drums then follows them through pseudo-perilous situations that feel labored (capturing a very young German sniper) or simply recycled (one of the men discovering that hes standing on a land mine). Alexandre Desplats intrusive score keeps telling us what mood we should be in. Moods change from moment to moment though and not only in the action sequences. Mr. Clooneys Frank Stokes the leader of the group is certainly a serious guy when it comes to appreciating the place of art in civilization but some of his subalterns have been written as caricatures of intellectuals let alone the distinguished scholars they were in real life. One of the running jokes--dumb jokes--concerns the hopelessly inept French spoken by Mr. Damons James Granger whos supposed to be the Metropolitan Museums curator of medieval art. A pre-eminent art historian who comes off like a country bumpkin? The script cooks up an equally dumb conflict between the Monuments Men and Ms. Blanchetts Claire Simone a fictional version of the remarkable real-life heroine Rose Valland. As the movie has it Claire mistrusts the Yanks. Instead of rejoicing in their arrival she ventures the patently absurd opinion that theyve come to find Europes missing art treasures in order to spirit them back to America. A little respect for real-world logic would not have weighed the movie down. Watch a clip from ""The Lego Movie."" An ordinary LEGO minifigure (Chris Pratt) is mistakenly recruited to join a quest to stop an evil LEGO tyrant (Will Ferrell) from gluing the universe together. Also starring Liam Neeson. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) The Lego Movie I never thought Id be dispensing praise by calling a movie a hodgepodge but then I never thought Id be praising a movie based on Lego toys; films generated by popular toy lines are often pretty awful. ""The Lego Movie"" an animated feature in 3-D was written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who first made their mark on the big screen with ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."" Its visual aesthetic simulates Lego construction--a riot of unruly modules--and its overall look is delightfully new. But the best part is what the movie has to say about conformity--following the instructions on the box--versus creativity i.e. life as a jumble an inspired improvisation a joyous hodgepodge. ENLARGE From left to right Wyldstyle (voiced by Elizabeth Banks) Batman (Will Arnett) and Emmet (Chris Pratt). Warner Bros. Pictures The hero Emmet is a little Lego figure living in a colorful Lego world of perfect happiness where he like everyone else follows elaborate instructions for snapping together his daily routine. The opening sequences set in this plastic utopia are themselves a whirlwind of creativity--everyone is happy and everything is awesome especially when youre part of a team. But Emmets life takes a sudden turn into existential confusion when a tough and sexy Lego minifigure named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) mistakes him for The Special--think Neo in ""The Matrix""--the figure fated to save the world. ""The Lego Movie"" moves fast--sometimes exhaustingly so--demands close attention and rewards it with a quick-witted script and a cast of inventive characters that includes President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) a villainous CEO who basically runs the world; his swivel-headed henchman Bad Cop/Good Cop (Liam Neeson); an ancient prophet Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman); and thanks to the wonders of Lego licensing Wyldstyles boyfriend Batman (Will Arnett). ENLARGE President Business voiced by Will Ferrell Warner Bros. Pictures Unlike the pell-mell pace the brilliance of those early sequences isnt sustained and a climactic device is plainly and simply a bad idea. Whats more the scripts satiric edge is blunted by unctuous banalities about being special--Emmet may not be The Special but he is told he is special in the sense that everyone is special. Yet ""The Lego Movie"" has a specialness all its own. Theres never been a hodgepodge quite like it. Watch a clip from the film ""In Bloom."" Set in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in 1992 Eka and Natia look to leave childhood behind as they ignore societal customs and work to escape their turbulent family lives. (Photo/Video Big World Pictures) In Bloom The original title of Georgias foreign-language Oscar submission translates to ""Long Bright Days"" but the new title ""In Bloom"" has a nicely ironic if accidental ambiguity. What exactly is in bloom--young love and hope or the domestic and political violence surrounding the lives of two teenage girls at the center of this modest but affecting debut feature? (The film was directed by Nana Ekvtimishvili and Simon Gross from Ms. Ekvtimishvilis screenplay.) Eka and Natia played respectively and impressively by Lika Babluani and Mariam Bokeria are friends and neighbors in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in 1992. It has been only a year since Georgia declared its independence from the Soviet Union and this is not to say the least a happy country. Some of the anger is situational--long breadlines electricity outages sullen cops and soldiers--but much of the darkness in the culture is universal macho boys with knives and attitude aggressive men who treat their women like chattels. In one of many chilling scenes drunken louts at a wedding toast the beauty of their women who are studies in resignation. Of the two friends Natia is strikingly attractive and woefully vulnerable while Eka with her mournful eyes and soulful demeanor is better able to take the measure of the grim life that threatens to engulf her. In the films most stirring scene Eka dances a ritual dance that seems to signal her entry into the adult world. This adroit and understated coming-of-age film reminded me of the New Wave of Czech films in the 1960s but with a distinctive poignancy that translates to wisdom. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE The Train (1964) French art treasures being shipped to Nazi Germany in an action thriller that knows its mission is to thrill. Paul Scofield is Von Waldheim the German colonel who has organized the shipment. Burt Lancaster is Labiche the French Resistance leader who (after interesting misgivings) sets out to stop him. The train and the railroad trappings become visual stars but even they in their steamy immensity cant compete with Lancaster a force of nature who did his own spectacular stunts. John Frankenheimer directed a cast that includes Jeanne Moreau Albert Remy and the great Michel Simon. ENLARGE Toy Story 2 (1999) The toys arent made of Lego bricks and they live their secret lives at a slower pace but their saga still stands as one of the two best sequels in movie history. (Toys didnt figure in the other one ""The Godfather Part II."") If youve seen it many times as I have and think theres nothing new to discover about it go to YouTube and search for ""How Toy Story 2 Almost Got Deleted."" Had it not been for a preposterously lucky fluke the film might never have made it to the screen. ENLARGE Since Otar Left (2003) The setting is Tbilisi the capital of Georgia and one of the protagonists is named Eka but this Eka far from being young and beautiful is a quick-witted matriarch played by 90-year-old Esther Gorintin. A Francophile who speaks French with a Provencal accent Eka dreams her own dreams of traveling to Paris to see her son Otar. When word comes that he has died in an accident Ekas daughter and granddaughter conceal the news from her in the belief that it would be more than she could bear. They are to put it mildly mistaken.

Columbia Pictures AP AP AP The Monuments Men   Director George Clooney Cast George Clooney Matt Damon Bill Murray Jean Dujardin Rated PG-13 (war violence smoking) Running time 118 min. Related links Behind Hollywood glitz Monuments Men is the work of a Texas oilman turned art lover By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 344pm on Thursday Feb. 06 2014 Thursday Feb. 06 2014 Friday Feb. 07 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram They dont make em like The Monuments Men anymore.For those of a certain age -- or who simply have a deep interest in American war films -- this George Clooney-directed WWII drama recalls the kind of stout-hearted combat movie that seemed to be so popular from the 50s through the early 70s. In fact the plot -- a group of older art experts recruited to sneak into Europe and rescue priceless works before the Germans or the Russians can get them -- recalls the likes of The Dirty Dozen or Kellys Heroes in which a small band of men must infiltrate Nazi lines.Theres none of Saving Private Ryans graphic realism or Inglorious Basterds cheeky cultural horseplay. There are no shades of gray. Even the score by Alexandre Desplat and the closing credits seem straight out of 1962. All of that is kind of cool in theory but as a film The Monuments Men falls short even if its message -- forms of creativity are worth preserving even in times of disaster -- remains a compelling one.Based on a true story and the book of the same name by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter The Monuments Men -- with its shifting tone between light comedy and drama -- rarely gets the viewer invested enough to really care what happens to them. And thats unfortunate because it really is a fascinating footnote in history.Clooney is Frank Stokes an art historian who at the beginning of the film is begging President Roosevelt to send a team to Europe to salvage much of the Wests cultural heritage. The president is intrigued but tasks Stokes with putting together a team of fellow art professionals to do it himself.So Stokes calls museum curator James Granger (Matt Damon) and other professionals in the field including historian Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) sculptor Walter Garfield (John Goodman) architect Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) art dealer Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) and Englishman Hugh Bonneville (Donald Jeffries) whose art credentials remain nebulous.Once in Europe Granger has to track down Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) an informal double agent who works for the Nazi bureau in charge of taking art to Germany where Hitler wants to open a sprawling Fuehrer Museum. However she really has ties with the Resistance and is keeping tabs on where the art is going.All of this is rife with possibilties but the set-up is too rushed. Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov only offer thin character sketches so when everyone is put in jeopardy their fates dont really matter. Its hard to care about any of them.On top of that there are moments of mild humor -- such as the rivalry between Campbell and Savitz -- that arent particularly funny. Its just one of the more obvious ways that this all-star cast is underutilized.There is one scene that works Campbell receives a recording that his family back home has made for him and Savitz as a surprise plays it over the camp loud speakers. The look on Murrays face conveys a wave of emotion that the rest of the film is lacking.It may not be a monumental moment but in this movie thats about as good as it gets. cdarlingdfw.com Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

When Europe was besieged by both Nazi looters and Allied bombers President Franklin Roosevelt authorized a small group of experts to find and safeguard the great treasures of Western civilization.Actor/director George Clooney has adapted the true story of the Monuments Men into an old-school crowd-pleaser. In this case ""old"" encompasses propaganda films from the 40s all-star flicks such as ""The Great Escape"" from the 60s and Steven Spielbergs retro ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" from 1981. In the light of more realistic war movies and 21st century cynicism patriotic posters have become harder to render and ""Monuments Men"" lacks a consistently steady hand but the broad strokes might appeal to audiences with softened sensibilities.Clooney stars as Frank Stokes an art historian who convinces the War Department that masterworks such as Da Vincis Mona Lisa and Michelangelos statue of David are worth protecting. He assembles a team that includes medievalist Matt Damon architect Bill Murray and sculptor John Goodman. But when the men arrive at Normandy a month after D-Day the beleaguered commanders dont share their priorities and the middle-age eggheads have to go it alone. Exploring the contrasts between high art and the horrors of war would have produced a more engaging film but Clooney generally sidesteps violence and sticks to a simpler path pushed forward by martial music and stirring speeches. Its not sufficient that Stokes gives his crew a pep talk about the importance of preserving our cultural heritage; the obligatory charming Frenchman (Jean Dujardin) has to ladle some additional cheese sauce about the honor of serving with such gallant comrades. And when Murray gets a holiday-greeting record from his family it not only includes a Judy Garland-caliber rendition of ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" it gets broadcast to an entire camp of young soldiers who are presumably about to get blown to smithereens at the Battle of the Bulge. Damon spends most of this treasure-hunt movie in liberated Paris with a prim curator (Cate Blanchett) who worries that the Americans might steal the recovered art for their own museums like the Russians are doing as they march into Europe from the East. Meanwhile the Holocaust is barely mentioned.Theres no law that says every movie about World War II has to depict the death camps but this film doesnt compensate for its narrow focus with character development derring-do or robust humor. Its admirable but ""Monuments Men"" just poses on a porous foundation like a statue.What ""The Monuments Men""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 158  Content Some images of war violence Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Starring George Clooney Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman and Cate Blanchett. Directed by George Clooney. (PG-13. 118 minutes.) ""The Monuments Men"" is an old-fashioned World War II movie of a kind Hollywood used to churn out 50 years ago back when the war was still a fairly recent memory. Today in the post-""Saving Private Ryan"" era war is invariably presented as a series of individual tragedies even in tough-minded films such as ""Lone Survivor."" But ""The Monuments Men"" harks back to a time when audiences more easily accepted that overall missions mean more than the problems of a few little people. So the movie has a certain gallantry and a spring in its step thats retro appealing and ever-so-slightly phony. The soundtrack is buoyant like the one for ""Stalag 17"" or ""Hogans Heroes"" and the overall mood is happy yet serious. Its a little bit funny and a little but schmaltzy a mostly jolly adventure in which people get killed. And in its own odd way the film makes the case for itself. ""The Monuments Men"" feels of the same era as the real-life Monuments Men and is a movie those guys probably would have understood and enjoyed. Its based on the exploits of a real-life platoon of mature guys with backgrounds in the arts whose task was to find and protect the millions of art treasures stolen and hidden by the Nazis. Related Stories Retired UC educator Taper was Monument Man True story behind The Monuments Men and Nazi art looting Legion of Honors Howe became Monuments Man The basic outline of the story is true though the characters and their names have been changed. George Clooney who also co-wrote and directed plays Stokes who heads the operation and enlists the group during the latter part of the war. He puts together a bunch of fun fellows - played by John Goodman Bob Balaban Bill Murray Matt Damon Hugh Bonneville and Jean Dujardin. They arrive in France one month after the Normandy invasion and get to work mostly just behind the front lines sometimes ahead of them. The actors skew a little bit older than the historical Monuments Men but their lived-in humanity forms a nice contrast to the inhumane megalomania that theyre trying to reverse. The Nazis may have strutting lunatics but we have John Goodman incongruous in an Army uniform leaving civilian life for the greater good. At one point someone describes what Hitler wanted to do with all the artwork to have it installed at a massive Fuhrer Museum in Linz Austria. Upon hearing this Bill Murray repeats the phrase ""Fuhrer Museum"" and theres a whole world in that line reading - awe at the hubris astonishment at the ridiculousness as well as weariness and sadness. Thats really what ""The Monuments Men"" is about art and people and knowing ones proper scale in the grand scheme. The film depicts a treasure hunt only in the sense that the movie has to have a running story. But it doesnt really trade on suspense or adventure and in the few places Clooney pushes it that way it doesnt feel right. Mainly its just a series of incidents there to remind you of the sacrifices of good people and of the importance of art in human civilization. These are modest artistic goals for the filmmakers but they involve big things - big enough to carry a somewhat choppy and flawed movie across the finish line. Much of the action takes place in France and Dujardin with his charm and infectious smile plays the lone French member of the group. Cate Blanchett plays a French woman who works at the Louvre and she seems as much of a stretch here as she did playing a German in ""The Good German."" A modest suggestion They have actual actresses in France and Germany and they dont even have to learn the accent. Next time think about it. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Photo Claudette Barius/Columbia Pictures/Twentieth Century Fox MOVIE REVIEW The Monuments Men Running time 118 minutes. Rated PG-13 (war violence). At the Empire the Union Square the Chelsea others. While millions of American soldiers were fighting with the Allies to save Europe from the Nazis in World War II a relative handful were involved in a different struggle to protect and recover tens of thousands of the continents greatest art treasures looted by the same enemy. That fascinating and inspiring if little-known historical chapter is recounted in George Clooneys ""The Monuments Men which brightens the normally bleak February release schedule because it wasnt ready in time for a planned opening in the December awards-movie corridor. Except possibly for a superlative supporting performance by Hugh Bonneville of ""Downton Abbey Clooneys low-key directorial effort is not quite an Oscar-caliber movie though its got a great cast a worthy theme and plenty of things to reward adult moviegoers. The Monuments Fine Arts and Archives section was a multinational group of mostly middle-aged museum officials artists architects and restorers who volunteered their services when it became clear that Hitlers elaborate plot to steal famous paintings sculptures and other masterpieces for his planned personal museum posed just as real a threat to art as the bombing of the continent. In this somewhat fictionalized version of Robert Edsels book using made-up names the unit is created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the urging of art restorer Frank Stokes (Clooney) who recruits James Granger (Matt Damon) a medieval-art curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as his chief lieutenant. Damon has the largest role in the ensemble cast assigned to Paris after the D-Day invasion. James is tasked with winning the confidence of Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) the director of an annex to the Louvre that had been pressed into service to store priceless art the Nazis confiscated mostly from Jewish collectors. Claire who secretly worked for the resistance while pretending to collaborate with the Germans may know where the art the Nazis spirited out of the annex has been hidden but fears James may want to ship it back to America. (Claire ultimately tries to seduce James in a scene that doesnt work at all.) Blanchetts character is based on Rose Valland -- who famously recruited French railway workers to sabotage a Nazi attempt to ship some of Frances greatest treasures to Germany just before the liberation of Paris. Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett star in ""The Monuments Men.""Photo Claudette Barius/Columbia Pictures That earlier episode was vividly depicted in John Frankenheimers thriller ""The Train (1965) with Burt Lancaster. Clooney takes pains to avoid comparisons to that earlier classic with his own far more episodic and sprawling story. Among the other cast members Bill Murray plays a famous architect teamed up with a grumpy Jewish officer (Bob Balaban) who seems to be based partly on New York arts impresario Lincoln Kirsten -- and they have a great scene where they discover some very famous paintings from the Rothschild collection in a French farmhouse owned by a Nazi collaborator. Another ace character actor John Goodman is cast as a sculptor who comes under fire with a French officer (Jean Dujardin of ""The Artist) assigned to the unit. Bonneville is the films standout in a small but crucial role as a disgraced English art historian with a drinking problem given a chance at redemption when hes posted to Belgium to protect a Michelangelo sculpture the Madonna of Bruges. Another priceless artwork the film focuses on is a huge and elaborate Flemish altar piece looted from a church. The Monuments Men are in a race with time to find and empty the Nazi hiding places ahead of the Russians -- who will treat them as spoils of war rather than returning them to their rightful owners. Clooney (who co-wrote the script as well as directed) mostly delivers exposition and eloquently explains why its worth risking mens lives to save centuries of mans greatest achievements which some German leaders were prepared to destroy rather than let fall into Allied hands. ""Monuments Men is a handsome-looking movie with great period detail and a jaunty score. Most important its a heartfelt tribute to men who gave up comfortable lives and careers to do what they had to do for posterity under incredibly difficult and dangerous circumstances.

Grade C- A 400-strong force of art historians artists impresarios and museum personnel became known as Monuments Men after entering the Allies Monuments Fine Arts and Archives programs in World War II determined to stop the ruination of European culture. Theyre reduced to a skimpy fictionalized squad of seven in ""The Monuments Men"" so every setback has a huge impact on each of them. George Clooney and his producing/writing partner Grant Heslov set out to make a film of big emotion to honor middle-age soldiers who abandoned families and careers to save the core of Western civilization. Theyve ended up combining a ragged collection of retreads from the war films they loved as kids with history lessons that could fit inside a tourist-shop picture book. This move is infuriating because it wastes a terrific too-little-known story (first told in Robert M. Edsels tiptop history of the same name). Hitlers minions were scouring the private collections of Jewish art-lovers as well as stripping national institutions the way the Sopranos would a sporting-goods store. For ultimate deposit at a future Fuhrermuseum in Hitlers home city of Linz the Nazis clipped everything from Old Masters to French Impressionists and masterpieces of church art - like Michelangelos sculpture of the Madonna and Child known as the Bruges Madonna and the van Eycks Ghent Altarpiece. (They were also burning ""degenerate"" contemporary art by the likes of Paul Klee and Picasso.) As defeat drew near Hitlers ""Nero decree"" stated that everything of possible value to the Allies should be demolished. The MFAA aimed to halt the destruction of historical buildings by Allied bombs salvage what they could from the Germans scorched-earth policy and also save artworks from the Soviets who had organized Trophy Brigades to get compensation for their 20 million war dead. From the start Clooney and Heslov put the Monuments Mens quest into cornpone form. This movie is part primer and part personality ensemble piece designed for each member to provide an art-saving coup a lecture about values a glorious death or a sentimental gesture designed to be poignant and memorable. The movie beggars credibility right from the beginning when the fictional founder of the MFAA (Clooney) presents a slide show explaining World War II to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. You expect FDR to whirl a cigarette in the air and growl ""Get on with it"" or maybe sic Fala on his leg. Instead he sanctions the program quicker than you can say ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself."" Then Clooney recruits his crew an expert in art restoration (Matt Damon) an architect (Bill Murray) a connoisseur and impresario (Bob Balaban) a sculptor (John Goodman) a British art historian (Hugh Bonneville) and a sympathetic Frenchman (Jean Dujardin). Rounding them up has none of the snap and punch of Richard Attenborough organizing POWs into escape artists in ""The Great Escape"" or Lee Marvin molding dangerous misfits into crack commandos in ""The Dirty Dozen."" Thats what Clooneys going for - and he misses badly. The music apes the infectious march from ""The Great Escape""; it sets a jaunty tone that in this film proves to be insanely incongruous. The group enters Europe on Normandy beach where soldiers are busy building crosses for the fallen. They soon acquire a young driver and translator (Dimitri Leonidas) a German-Jewish GI aching to get into the good fight. But their mood darkens only after one of their team gets gunned down in a church. They conduct their campaign on the buddy system. The chief pairs them off and sends them on separate missions keeping in touch via field phones - or as they call it ""Monuments Men Radio."" This plan has its entertainment benefits. The amiable Damon plumbs the mind of a dramatic French art worker (Cate Blanchett) who wont give up her secrets until the Americans prove theyll return stolen art to its proper owners. Working beautifully off lumbering Goodman Dujardin sustains the films one true star turn as a graceful ebullient Gallic Everyman. (Lets hope Dujardin gets to enliven more American movies.) Murray exploits his deep unflappability to the hilt as he calms the nervous tetchy Balaban and a young jittery German soldier. But even in the few good scenes the setups are stronger than the payoffs. Intermittently Clooney will give a speech about the importance of culture as the record of human achievement and the collective memory of the human past. The movie raises the question of whether rescuing art is worth losing a human life. I guess it might depend on whether the work at hand is the Bruges Madonna or a movie as feeble as ""The Monuments Men.""

When you realize its not coming together your first impulse is to ask What happened?There were signs of trouble when The Monuments Men was bumped from the prestigious year-end schedule and set aside for reconstructive surgery. Apparently the procedure didnt take. Sequences of the jocular male bonding we expect from director-star George Clooney collide with grave tales of wars sacrifice and civics-lesson lectures on arts cultural necessity. A movie that should be fraught with urgency instead sputters fromepisode to episode.None of it is particularly terrible; small pieces are quite compelling. But a movie with even half The Monuments Mens aspirations needs a personality and a swift narrative thrust. As it is the movie feels as scattered as the Rembrandts Picassos and other art jewels strewn throughout Germany.Its hard to blame Clooney for seeing the premises potential for fun. The assembled art experts (Clooney Matt Damon John Goodman Bill Murray Jean Dujardin Hugh Bonneville and Bob Balaban) are classic fish out of water unaccustomed to firearms combat commanding officers or other staples of This Mans Army. Theyre a little like the Hollywood filmmakers who join the war effort to shoot high-grade propaganda in Mark Harris upcoming nonfiction book Five Came Back. They have an important job and they have the passion to carry it out.Most of that passion gets lost on the way to the screen though you can still locate the fragments hereand there. Cate Blanchett smolders as Claire Simone based on the French art historian and Resistance fighter Rose Valland. Greta Garbo would love this performance. She might also wonder why it seems to exist in a different universe from everyone else in the movie.Thats what The Monuments Men needs cohesion glue a unifying vision of what it wants to be and how to get there. If that sounds simple it really isnt. When you think about it with so many moving parts and personalities in the mix its a marvel that any movie comes out feeling fully cooked -- even when the ingredients are the best available.THE MONUMENTS MEN (C)Directed by George Clooney.

Comments click to enlarge The Monuments Men Video Rated PG-13  118 minutes  2014 The Monuments Fine Arts and Archives program established by the Allies during World War II to protect European and Asian cultural treasures from destruction deserves a better movie dramatization than this fumbling prestige project from writers George Clooney and Grant Heslov (Good Night and Good Luck). Clooney stars as an art-conservator-turned-army-captain who leads a team of fellow eggheads into Germany to chase down and secure such stolen masterpieces as the Ghent Altarpiece and Michelangelos Madonna of Bruges. Their mission is treated with a stifling piety interrupted only by battlefield cliches and labored comedy from the assembled rat pack (Matt Damon John Goodman Jean Dujardin Hugh Bonneville and doing an arthritic Mutt-and-Jeff routine Bill Murray and Bob Balaban). As a vision of postwar Germany this has the tidy Hollywood feel of Steven Soderberghs The Good German (2006) with Clooney and Cate Blanchett; the latter appears here as a French curator grimacing through some sketchy romantic scenes with Damon.

"The Monuments Men The treasure chest is empty review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Monuments Men The treasure chest is empty reviewThe call to adventure becomes an exercise in embalming war movie cliches in George Clooneys The Monuments Men an early disappointment for 2014.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 6 2014The Monuments MenStarring George Clooney Matt Damon Bill Murray Cate Blanchett John Goodman Bob Balaban Jean Dujardin Hugh Bonneville and Dimitri Leonidas. Directed by George Clooney. Opens Feb. 7 at GTA theatres. 118 minutes. PGThe call to adventure becomes an exercise in embalming war movie cliches in The Monuments Men an early and major disappointment for 2014.George Clooney -- who stars directs produces and co-writes -- dearly wishes his labour of love could be more than this as might we all.Article Continued BelowBut in seeking to tell a backstage story of World War II heroics the quest to recover millions of European art riches stolen by Nazi Germany Clooney and his writing/producing partner Grant Heslov entomb rather than elevate.From left Bill Murray Dimitri Leonidas George Clooney and Bob Balaban are ""The Monuments Men"" in a new movie that cant quite decide what it wants to be.The film is supposed to be about ""the greatest treasure hunt in history"" to quote the subtitle of the book by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter that informs the screenplay.What we get is considerably less thrilling from a film that boasts a top-flight cast that also includes Matt Damon Bill Murray Cate Blanchett Bob Balaban Jean Dujardin and Hugh Bonneville.They play the real-life academics curators and historians who were summoned by circumstance and destiny to rescue millions of artworks stolen by Hitlers troops. The art was taken from museums and private homes for a planned Fuhrermuseum in Austria and later threatened with destruction near wars end as vengeful Nazis fled advancing Allied troops.Shifting unsteadily between action film and character study and from drama to comedy The Monuments Men never finds a consistent tone apart from plundering innumerable war movies past especially those starring Steve McQueen Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood.Clooney realized this last fall when he pulled the film out of Oscar consideration and sent it back to the editing bay. The salvage job failed -- although there are moments particularly in the fast-moving finale when you see the movie this could have been.This is one occasion where ""based on a true story"" becomes more of a millstone than a badge of honour.Early in the film as Clooneys feisty scholar Frank Stokes urges a quizzical president Franklin D. Roosevelt (seen in profile) to create the Monuments Men special force he argues that the effort is needed ""to ensure the statue of David is still standing and the Mona Lisa is still smiling."" (In reality both masterpieces had been hidden from Nazi looters by resourceful curators in Florence and Paris.)Had these two iconic works really been the object of the films quest The Monuments Men might have played with the single-minded authority of Steven Spielbergs Raiders of the Lost Ark another obvious influence (right down to the final scene a brazen theft of Spielbergs visual uplift).Instead it goes in for the scattershot approach of chasing truckloads of art pieces across multiple European town and cities with the ensemble cast split into pairings that weirdly recall their previous movie couplings. Clooney and Damon lamely go in for more Oceans Thirteen macho antics; Murray and Balaban enjoyably squabble with Moonrise Kingdom quirkiness; and Goodman and Dujardin bizarrely reteam as if their late-1920s characters from The Artist had matured to join the war effort. Mainly operating solo are Bonneville as a British museum chief with a troubled past and the underused Blanchett as a mysteriously motivated French museum curator.Clooney rounds up his art chasers with a dispatch that makes his Vegas caper movies seem downright plodding but character nuance and empathy become the first casualties of this war picture. A feeling of teamwork is rarely achieved and when tragedy strikes in the line of duty as we know it must its difficult to feel the loss of people whom we barely know.The movie is further weighed down by Phedon Papamichaels dull cinematography much of it shot in half-light for what seems budgetary reasons rather than artistic ones -- hide those anachronismsAlexandre Desplats score meanwhile is a mash-up of patriotic war themes replete with all-too-familiar whistling and drumming.Most suffocating of all is the formaldehyde of Clooneys constant reminders via character dialogue and narrative voice-overs that these Monuments Men are ""fighting for our culture and our way of life.""For this artistic endeavour the battle was already lost when Clooney and Heslov failed to decide what kind of war movie they really wanted to make.Read more about George ClooneyThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. The front lines of ""The Monuments Men"" are filled with artistry and a willingness to fall in line behind great military-movie tradition. As it marches on though the movie has a rank-and-file feel that fights to keep our attention. Not that there isnt plenty to savor in director and star George Clooneys thinking-mans version of ""The Dirty Dozen"" or ""The Guns of Navarone"" Its written and played smartly and with a Clooneyesque lack of bombast. Theres great repartee between its cast of this ""based on a true [but forgotten] story"" of World War II. Matt Damon (l.) and George Clooney are on the trail of stolen art treasures in The Monuments Men. (Claudette Barius) Yet the film overall isnt colorful enough. Cate Blanchett as Claire in The Monuments Men (Claudette Barius) In late 1944 and early 45 as the tide is turning against the Axis the Nazis are still pillaging Europes greatest paintings and sculptures to fill Hitlers hoped-for ""Fuhrer Museum."" New York art historian Frank Stokes (Clooney) convinces FDR to let him assemble a small team of architects and scholars to rescue whatever culture they can from the Third Reich. George Clooneys art expert makes his case to President Roosevelt (Mike Dalton). (Claudette Barius) Stokes may not have a dirty dozen but he does build a doughy half-dozen that includes his pal Granger (Matt Damon); the shlump-and-shlumpier combo of Campbell (Bill Murray) and Savitz (Bob Balaban); the loyal Garfield (John Goodman); an Englishman (Hugh Bonneville) and a Frenchman (Jean Dujardin). Once they stumble through basic training the team disperses to locate missing masterpieces most crucially Michelangelos sculpture ""Madonna of Bruges"" and the Ghent altarpiece -- a piece Stokes calls ""the anchor of Christendom."" Bob Balaban (left seated) and John Goodman near the front lines in The Monuments Men. (Claudette Barius) As Granger coaxes intel out of a suspicious French museum worker (Cate Blanchett) the others set off in pairs to find Picassos in mineshafts and wrest Bruegels from the barbarians. From left Dimitri Leonidas John Goodman George Clooney Matt Damon and Bob Balaban in The Monument Men (Claudette Barius) Clooney and his friend and collaborator Grant Heslov (""Good Night and Good Luck"" ""The Ides of March"") are two of the good guys of cool historical cinema. They make sure ""Monuments Men"" is fleet and fun but wisely stop short of simply making ""Oceans Eleven"" with jeeps. Matt Damon with Cate Blanchett who plays a French art expert in The Monuments Men (Claudette Barius) Still the light touch has a cost. Specifically a lack of nail-biting sequences and a sense of epic scale. There are ultimate sacrifices intrigue and striking (alas digital) images of bombed-out cities but theres danger missing. When the team is together though the bonhomie works. Clooney and Damon have such a cool easy rapport that their scenes together zoom by and Goodman Murray and Balaban provide solid character turns. They all take a backseat to a story just amazing enough to seem tailor-made for the movies. But the film needed more wildness in the style of the big-screen adventures it evokes. We leave ""Monuments Men"" thinking about its craftsmanship but wondering if theres a more combustible movie between the lines.

The movie is based off of the real life ""Monuments Men"" a group of more than 300 men and women from thirteen countries who worked together to protect and recover the stolen cultural artifacts. Their ranks ranged from museum directors to architects -- and they would ultimately help return more than five million artistic and cultural items plundered by the Nazis. How a group of scholars became soldiers to save European culture from Hitler Adolf Hitler a frustrated painter who found other outlets for his creative anger was the most prolific art collector since Napoleon. He acquired his stash of sculptures paintings and monuments the same way Napoleon did by conquering nations and claiming the treasure. Some of the loot (particularly from antiquity) he intended to put on display in a museum in his hometown of Linz Austria; some (including modern especially by Jews) he planned to burn like his least favorite books. Toward the end of World War II when the thousand-year reign of the Third Reich looked to be ending about 988 years early the German high command issued the Nero Decree if Hitler were to die all the art the Nazis had stolen and hidden must be destroyed. Franklin Roosevelts notion of arts value was more sophisticated than Hitlers -- and Donald Rumsfelds. Recall the Defense Secretarys reaction to the news in April 2003 that the Iraq National Museum housing priceless artifacts dating to the dawn of civilization 6000 years ago had been looted while U.S. forces occupied Baghdad. ""Freedoms untidy"" Rumsfeld said. ""Stuff happens."" To keep stuff from happening in Hitlers Europe Roosevelt and his allies set up the Monuments Fine Arts and Archives section a mission of museum curators and art historians to recapture and protect the treasures the Germany military had stolen from invaded nations and its own Jewish citizens. Thanks to the 365 MFAA heroes many thousands of artworks were saved and many of those were restored to their rightful owners or their surviving kin. (MORE How the Monuments Men Won the Art War Against Hitler) The Monuments Men based on the book by Robert Edsel and Bret Witter is George Clooneys vigorous attempt to invest vivid movie life into the story of a group of middle-aged intellectuals who often had to skirt U.S. Army dicta even as they schemed to save Europes culture. In writing the lightly fictionalized script with Grant Heslov and directing himself and a starry cast Clooney kept the tone low-key and necessarily anecdotal. This isnt Lee Marvins Dirty Dozen a platoon of martial misfits on a single mission. They are the Arty Dozen more or less often on separate sorties spanning France Germany and Belgium chasing Picassos Matisses and a Michelangelo Madonna. In Inglourious Basterds his version of The Dirty Dozen Quentin Tarantino fantasized that the Jews rose to kill Hitler. Clooney sticking pretty much to the facts shows how a handful of art historians killed the Fuhrers dream of annexing and purifying European culture. (MORE Richard Corlisss Review of Inglourious Basterds) Frank Stokes (Clooney) and his American colleagues -- Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) Walter Garfield (John Goodman) -- were bred as scholars not soldiers. They are joined by Jean-Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) a member of the French Resistance and the one youngster on the team Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas) a Jew who escaped Hitler went to America and has returned for payback. In Paris the Metropolitan Museums James Granger (Matt Damon) finds an invaluable ally in Clare Simone (Cate Blanchett) who has worked at the Jeu de Paume Frances repository of Impressionist masterpieces and under the noses of the Nazis has secretly kept a record of their transactions. One of Stokes men the English art historian Donald Jeffries (Downton Abbeys Hugh Bonneville) makes his way to Bruges Belgium to a church where he may find the Michelangelo. ""Are you Catholic?"" a priest asks. Jeffries replies ""I am tonight."" (MORE Clooney and Blanchett Revisit World War II in The Good German) Hollywood addressed this theme nearly a half-century ago in John Frankenheimers 1965 film The Train with Burt Lancaster as a French Resistance leader charged with retrieving his countrys art from the Nazis. Both films dance the tightrope of culture and carnage. Lancaster ""I wont waste lives on paintings."" Clooney ""No piece of art is worth a mans life."" But it is worth a movie -- two movies one a burly action epic the other a more thoughtful character study -- about brave people engaged in the fine art of saving it for generations to come. So Lancaster bellows ""Its our national heritage the glory of France"" And Clooney proclaims ""Were fighting for a culture and our way of life. If you destroy their achievements their history then its as if they never existed."" (MORE Subscribe for TIMEs 1965 Review of The Train) The Monuments Men has its share of startling moments -- a visit to the dentist that leads to an Impressionist cache and the revelation of mountains of German gold appallingly appropriated from the teeth of exterminated Jews -- plus a land-mine dilemma for Damon. But rather than juicing each element to blockbuster volume Clooney has delivered it in the tone of a memorial lecture warm and ambling given by one of the distinguished academics he put in his movie. Unused to physical daring they found surprising resources of grit stamina and ingenuity. They risked their lives to save a culture that preceded them by centuries and because of their devotion will outlast them by centuries. At the end a much older Frank Stokes (played by Clooneys newscaster father Nick now 80) takes his grandson to see some of the classical handiwork the Monuments Men reclaimed from Hitler. They deserved their own movie monument which Clooney has generously and artfully given them. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet With his easygoing charm his traditional good looks and his refined masculinity George Clooney has always seemed like a movie star out of time--a living embodiment of what Hollywood used to look for in its leading men. Theres certainly something very Golden Age about his charisma about the way he doesnt so much disappear into roles as play variations on a single pleasing persona. Hes old-fashioned as a director too but less naturally so While Clooney the actor simply exudes classical appeal Clooney the filmmaker actively transparently strives for it. His films most of which are period pieces approach American history through the lens of cinematic history--paying tribute to Edward R. Murrow through an evocation of 50s movies and television or exploring contemporary politics by way of 70s political thrillers. Theyre referential and reverential sometimes to a fault. Clooneys latest The Monuments Men may be his most earnestly retro effort yet. In tackling a non-fiction novel about the quest to rescue stolen European artwork during WWII the actor-turned-director has made a square star-studded throwback to a bygone era of Hollywood war movies. Absent is the extreme violence and moral ambiguity of most contemporary combat pictures; in their place Clooney offers heroic servicemen villainous Nazis a fundamentally honorable mission and the rousing fanfare of Alexandre Desplats antiquated score. All of this should amount to an effervescent caper a revival of the simple pleasures of a simpler cinematic age. But Clooney swelling with noble purpose wants it to be something grander. As a result The Monuments Men feels not just self-conscious but also a bit self-congratulatory its creator squashing the spirit of adventure with too many grandiose lines about the Importance Of Art.Clooney stars as Frank Stokes an art historian deeply concerned about the worlds supply of masterpieces many of which have been pilfered by the Germans to fill Hitlers personal museum. Under instruction from President Roosevelt Frank assembles a task force of fellow academics; because most of the nations younger art lovers are already overseas fighting hes forced to recruit a roster of older men--six aging intellectuals played by Matt Damon John Goodman Bill Murray Hugh Bonneville Bob Balaban and the French George Clooney Jean Dujardin. After panting and wheezing their way through basic training these unlikely troops head for Europe pairing off into twos to chase leads (and paintings) across the continent.Superficially speaking the men-on-a-quest narrative--adapted by Clooney and his semi-regular writing partner Grant Heslov--recalls Steven Spielbergs Saving Private Ryan another film that weighs individual lives against the importance of a mission. But The Monuments Men has no interest in the entrails-out gruesomeness of the battlefield; by design it resembles an earlier less explicit brand of American war movie the kind made before the country got a long televised look at the horrors of Vietnam. Clooney though doesnt just cut past the bloodshed happening around his heroes. He also drains the movie of urgency. Even when the men find their lives at risk or when they encounter death during their parallel journeys a sense of danger never creeps into the proceedings. At times Clooney even seems to be willfully deflating iconic moments from other war movies He offers a tranquil echo of the Normandy beach scene in Private Ryan and reconfigures Full Metal Jackets most devastating reveal into a punchline. A fog of Great War nostalgia rolls over The Monuments Men romantically clouding its vision of a battle-ravaged Europe.There are pleasures as there would be for any movie with a cast this good. For example Murray and Balaban whose mismatched characters are forced into a partnership inject some antagonistic odd-couple chemistry into their scenes. And Damons moments with Cate Blanchett who plays a Parisian forced to collaborate with the Nazis create some fleeting friction. Yet as characters the Monuments Men are so noble--so unburdened by second thoughts or selfish desires--that theres little actual drama in their exploits (beyond of course the drama of whether theyll find the famous paintings in time). Clooney has them experience loss and survivors guilt but he never forces them to make tough decisions; in lionizing these men he turns them into cardboard saints. Every opportunity for real tension is missed When the team discovers that the Germans have been ordered to destroy the artwork if they lose the war Dujardins character quips ""Lets hope no one kills Hitler""--a loaded offhand remark thats never challenged despite the fact that it seems to get to the heart of the films moral quandary about the sacrifices that should be made for the sake of culture.Casting himself as the conscience of the film Clooney spends much of his screen time delivering grave speeches his character little more than a mouthpiece for the actor playing him. (As the South Park boys might quip the smug emissions from this movie are off the chart.) Yet for all the endless talk of art as the grand achievement of civilization not one of the characters articulates these feelings in specific terms. One could argue that by keeping archaic cinematic virtues alive Clooney is mirroring the efforts of his subjects. In truth however hes made a film about the value of art that has little to say about art and an ode to preserving history that plays a little fast and loose with the facts of history. Theres another way in which Clooney is old-fashioned Hollywood has always rewritten the past to suit its own crowd-pleasing interests.

Thats the mystery that propels the plot of ""The Monuments Men"" a WWII drama about a ragtag team of curators in uniform searching for Nazi troves of stolen paintings and statuary. Sadly its also the question bedeviling the movie itself. How can this be? George Clooney has proved he can direct and write as well as act and the cast seems bulletproof Matt Damon Cate Blanchett Bill Murray and thats for starters. Its a great story and much of its true. The movie should work like a pip. Instead ""The Monuments Men"" is a labored mishmash of tones Half ""Hogans Post-Doctoral Heroes"" half ""Saving Private Rembrandt"" and half ""Ingress 11.""

"Review Monuments Men a noble effort missed opportunity - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Monuments Men a noble effort missed opportunityBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 02/05/2014 120000 PM PSTUpdated 02/05/2014 045943 PM PST Related StoriesFeb 6A look at a real man portrayed in Monuments MenGeorge Clooneys ""The Monuments Men"" is an entirely respectable film. And thats why its a disappointment.With all the talent involved the charismatic filmmakers latest should be exceptional. As it is the star-studded ""Men"" is bland a missed opportunity to be something better.The premise is certainly unbeatable recounting the valiant actions of a band of art appreciators and scholars who heroically ventured onto the front lines to save masterworks from the Nazis during World War II. These seven academics-turned-soldiers risked their lives in an attempt to retrieve countless influential pieces from the clutches of the Nazis and the art-loving Fuhrer who planned to build a museum out of his stolen goods. They also worked with the Allies to try to prevent other pieces and sculptures from being destroyed in the heat of battle. What they managed to save is remarkable.Theres a thrilling cinematic experience to be had out of cant-miss material like that. But while ""Monuments Men"" lights a few sparks here and there it fails to catch fire. Clooney who also co-wrote directed and co-produced plays Frank Stokes the leader of the group. Stokes an art historian has the ear of FDR and convinces him to greenlight an unlikely team of nonsoldiers including an architect (Bill Murray a scene stealer) on an art-saving mission. After a bit of basic training they arrive in Europe in the hopes of curbing the destruction of pieces and historical structures and rescuing art thats been looted by the Nazis.Advertisement Other top-brass actors enlisted to play members on Stokes team include Oscar-winners Jean Dujardin and Matt Damon along with John Goodman Bob Balaban and Hugh Bonneville. In a small but pivotal role Cate Blanchett another Oscar winner plays Claire Simone a wary French art curator whos observed much and knows even more. As usual Blanchett makes good use of every moment shes on screen. This undated publicity photo provided by Sony Pictures Publicity shows actors Matt Damon and Kate Blanchett in a scene from the Columbia Pictures film ""The Monuments Men."" Damon portrays James Rorimer who was one of a group of men tasked with saving works of art during World War II. ((AP Photo/Sony Pictures Publicity)) But despite these good performances and a few outstanding scenes -- from a smartly done interrogation sequence to a somber one in which the song ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" evokes the bitter reality of a soldiers life -- ""The Monuments Men"" feels routine. Other times it comes off uneven as it inserts rote and flat comedy into drama.Clooney says he viewed ""Monuments"" not as a war picture but a heist film. And that might be part of the problem -- this just isnt the right subject matter for another ""Oceans"" lark.What ""Men"" does possess is a commendable passion for expressing how important art is to every culture a subject thoroughly warranting our attention and applause. Unfortunately there are so many speeches and conversations that the topic gets restated reframed and repurposed over and over. We get it.That and the fluctuating tone point to problems with the screenplay co-written by Clooney and frequent collaborator Grant Heslov. Unlike their right-on-target ""Good Night and Good Luck"" this adaptation of the praised book by Robert M. Edsel with Bret Witter takes more of a fictional approach creating characters with different identities and storylines than the real ""Monuments Men."" To be fair the duo did this out of respect for the real characters which is a noble gesture.In fact ""The Monuments Men"" has many good intentions. Its just unfortunate that it didnt have more spirit and a steady sense of what it should be.The monuments men   1/2Rating PG-13 (for some images of war violence and historical smoking)Cast George Clooney Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman Cate Blanchett Jean Dujardin Bob Balaban Hugh BonnevilleDirector George ClooneyRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

(Claudette Barius) C- The Monuments Men Genre Drama; Starring Cate Blanchett George Clooney Daniel Craig Matt Damon Bill Murray; Director George Clooney; Release Date Wide 02/07/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 119; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted February 19 2014 -- 1200 AM EST Up until now Ive liked every movie that George Clooney has directed (yes even Leatherheads his 1920s screwball football comedy). So when I heard about The Monuments Men his sixth outing as a filmmaker I figured it probably couldnt miss. Based on one of those reality-is-stranger-than-fiction historical incidents it tells the unlikely story of a team of museum curators and art historians who were sent behind enemy lines during World War II to recover hundreds of pieces of art that had been pilfered by Nazi thieves. The purpose of the mission was to rescue and preserve the very civilization we were fighting to save. As film material this story would seem to have everything suspense hidden treasure Nazis aesthetic resonance -- and a chance for actors like Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman and Clooney to cut loose in new ways playing professorial dweebs who become cloak-and-dagger heroes. The Monuments Men sounds like a whats-not-to-like? movie but it turns out to be a bizarre failure. Its not just that the film is dull -- its that theres no there there to like. This should have been a historical heist film but the script by Clooney and Grant Heslov leaves out the heist or anything else of conventionally pleasing intrigue. The basic detective story -- how did these men locate the works? -- barely makes it into the foreground. Whats there instead? A bunch of wispy anecdotal scenes that go nowhere with characters who are too underwritten to be called Johnny one-notes; most of the actors hardly get a note to hum. The key trait of Damons character for instance is that he speaks French badly (this results in quels hi-larious fractured-syntax subtitles). As for Murray Goodman and Jean Dujardin they all stand around dropping toothless quips into the void. As the art restorer who organizes the mission Clooney gives himself way too many lofty lines in which he explains why saving art is worth the price of soldiers lives. He makes the case but that isnt a movie -- its closer to a high-toned movie pitch meeting with a built-in liberal subtext about the trashing of artifacts during the Iraq war. Next time Clooney should make sure that the film hes making is as good as the pitch.

In the last three years of World War II while Hitler was ravaging Europe a small group of soldiers historians and academics joined forces under the approval and guidance of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to locate rescue and return to their rightful owners the European art treasures of the world artifacts stolen from museums churches and private collectors by the Third Reich. These unheralded heroes were called the Monuments Men. This is their story. It is true. It is history. As a film it is riveting suspenseful harrowing and exciting and somehow it also manages to be something rare among war pictures--a big-scale entertainment. The Monuments Men 1/2 (3.5/4 stars) Written by George Clooney and Grant Heslov Directed by George Clooney Starring George Clooney Cate Blanchett and Matt Damon Running time 118 min. The Monuments Men covers so much territory that it is difficult to know just where to begin. In his best directed film since Good Night and Good Luck George Clooney who also co-wrote the screenplay with Grant Heslov proves hes more than just another pretty face collating archival information from the great book by Robert M. Edsel into a solid adventure story that seldom lags. Mr. Clooney with fewer hully-chee smirks than usual also plays the paterfamilias of the platoon--an art historian named Frank Stokes based on renowned Harvard art conservationist George Stout. He gathers six colleagues too old for the trenches and too out of shape for boot camp--one curator of medieval art at the Metropolitan Museum (Matt Damon) one architect (Bill Murray) one sculptor (John Goodman) one French art dealer (Jean Dujardin) one historian (Bob Balaban) one British art expert (Downton Abbeys Hugh Bonneville) and a young German Jew who acts as a driver and translator (Dimitri Leonidas). We follow their meticulous sleuthing from their landing on an allied-protected beach at Normandy to the farmhouses and country hamlets of France and Belgium and all the way to the Battle of the Bulge and ending under the German salt mines where they uncover 16000 concealed treasures stored for Hitlers proposed Fuhrer Museum nestled among 100 tons of gold from the fillings in the teeth of captured Jews. The Monuments Men were racing against time to protect Picassos and Rembrandts and Da Vincis Last Supper from both the retreating Nazis and the advancing Russians while trying to convince the skeptics (including two U.S. presidents) that the work was imperative to remind the world that civilization is defined by the quality of its art--a still evolving subject that has only been addressed once on the screen in John Frankenheimers The Train (1964) with Burt Lancaster Paul Scofield and Jeanne Moreau. There is tragedy along the way but humor too. Everyone has a strong scene--Mr. Damon as James Granger who accidentally stands on a mine while the others try to figure out how to detonate it and director Clooney when his character tells a captured Nazi commandant how hell relish reading his obituary while visiting a Jewish delicatessen when he gets back to New York. Theres a running gag about Jamess terrible French which he learned to the horror of the French allies in Montreal. Theres a moving scene in a makeshift hospital camp in Germany where a phonograph record from home plays ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" over a loudspeaker for the dying and wounded soldiers. O.K. Mr. Clooney can be shamelessly manipulative but Ill be damned if the scene doesnt work as forcefully as the sight of the German swastika flying over the roofs of Paris. Critics in the trades and at the Berlin Film Festival have dispatched mixed reviews objecting to poetic license like the near-romance between James and Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) a mousy bespectacled Resistance fighter based on real-life curator Rose Valland who worked as a secretary for Hermann Goring when he used the Jeu de Paume Museum in 1943 to store Nazi plunder risking her life to secretly document the shipment of every work of art transported to Germany by her boss. In what I assume to be a fictional add-on for the sake of melodrama and a touch of sentiment she befriends James after she is falsely imprisoned as a German collaborator and entrusts him with her ledgers and journals. This act of altruism and Claires subsequent attempt to seduce the highly ethical all-American husband played by Mr. Damon may be Mr. Clooneys ruse to raise the blood pressure and arouse the audiences possible waning interest in a film that is otherwise totally sexless. But in reality Ms. Vallands meticulous records did lead to the recovery of thousands of masterpieces the Monuments Men would otherwise never have located. Jim Bissells magnificent sets stunning location camerawork throughout Europe by Phedon Papamichael and a fabulous score by composer Alexandre Desplat that brought tears to my eyes are all big reasons why a movie this massive deserves bravos. With looted art still turning up in Germany every year the search continues so the movie could not be more relevant. At a time crowded with moronic action flicks pointless remakes and animated juvenilia its a genuine pleasure to experience a mature film about something that changed the world. Staging so many vignettes over such a protracted period of time frames with such a large cast in such a variety of countries a disconnected sense of ""wait a minute whats going on here?"" is inevitable. But The Monuments Men is still one hell of a monumental motion picture. Thirty years from now will anyone remember the accomplishments of those saviors of five-million works of art that enriched the aesthetic history of the world? Thanks to George Clooney they will now.

Films that could skew serious (""The Great Escape"") or comic (""Kellys Heroes"") but provided big-name casts in rousing cheer-on-the-good-guys adventures? George Clooney must. Because his new ""The Monuments Men"" is a bit of a throwback to those old days of Jim Garner and barracks-room jokes from its jaunty music to some corny compositions (whenever FDR or Truman show up theyre kept in the shadows in respectful silhouette). The film itself isnt always a comfortable mix of light and dark -- Clooney gives his own character some didactic monologues about the importance of art which sound like the first-draft of an awards-dinner speech and feel out of place with much of the rest of the story. Still its a well-made movie with the kind of old-fashioned care and craft -- real European locations living human extras -- that stand out in these days of computer-generated everything. The story based on fact revolves around a small group of American academics -- most of them too old or out of shape for regular service -- who volunteer to get into uniform and enter embattled Europe landing just behind the D-Day forces. Their improbable mission? Save the worlds masterpieces -- before the Nazis finish looting (or destroying) the lot. John Frankenheimer and Burt Lancaster made another film touching on the subject ""The Train"" a long time ago but Clooneys script -- written wth longtime partner Grant Heslov -- sticks closer to history and breaks up its motley crew for separate stories. Matt Damon goes to Paris to try to track the treasures and get some information out of a suspected (but innocent) collaborator. Bill Murray and Bob Balaban head in one direction in search of farflung Nazi hiding places; John Goodman and Jean Dujardin head in another. Its a bit like ""The Great Escape"" in which the heroes went their separate ways although the script doesnt really develop things particularly its central idea That the Army needed art historians to help identify what was valuable. (Apart from noticing a Rothschild label on the back of an Impressionist these fellows dont do any detecting work at all.) Yet Clooney is a generous enough actor (and smart enough director) to make sure each of his guest stars gets his own ""moment."" Theres a good running joke about Damons awful French for example and a lovely mournful one as Murray listens to a holiday message from home. Goodman gets a strong serious scene as he sees to an injured comrade and Cate Blanchett -- as a fiercely independent anti-fascist -- a bittersweet one in a freshly liberated Paris. N.J.

And it is interesting to see a sort of intellectual war movie in which the point isnt the fighting (though armed none of our heroes actually kills anybody) as much as the sort of causes worth fighting for. The Nazis werent just opposed to us the movie declares. They were opposed to individuality to imagination to freedom. And what else does great art stand for? ""The Monuments Men"" itself is not particularly great art. Theres nothing very complicated (beyond the possibility of an adulterous affair for one of the far-from-home characters) nor even too surprising. There are very good guys very bad guys and very pretty pictures and the films simple moral -- art matters -- is driven home repeatedly. Perhaps it would have seemed more original 50 years ago with Garner or Steve McQueen. But in a way its familiarity is part of its small charm -- and in a modern world full of imperfect causes its occasional nostalgic comfort. Ratings note The film contains violence and some brief strong language. The Monuments Men (PG-13) Columbia (118 min.) Directed by George Clooney. With Clooney Matt Damon John Goodman Bill Murray.

"The Monuments Men movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW The Monuments Men  Video The Monuments Men disappoints Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""The Monuments Men."" (Posted on February 6 2014) Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""The Monuments Men."" (Posted on February 6 2014) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A genial disappointment about the preciousness of art amid the destructive horrors of war ""The Monuments Men"" is scored to a military march by composer Alexandre Desplat. You hear what he was going for jaunty heroics. The throwback sound of it suggests the director co-writer and star George Clooney sat down with Desplat gave him a smile and said ""Gimme some of that Elmer Bernstein Great Escape magic Al.""It almost works. The whole film with its unfashionable techniques (slow fades and dissolves by the dozen) and uber-relaxed old-school vibe almost works. Yet Clooneys attempt to honor unsung real-life heroes while recapturing the ensemble pleasures of some well-remembered Hollywood war pictures notably ""The Great Escape"" and ""The Guns of Navarone"" comes off as a modestly accomplished forgery at best. You keep waiting for it to kick into gear for the odd-couple banter between Bill Murray and Bob Balaban to start clicking. The actors including Matt Damon John Goodman Jean Dujuardin Hugh Bonneville and Cate Blanchett as a Parisian curator based on Rose Valland are present and ready for duty. Its ""Oceans Eight"" this time with serious historical import. The script by Clooney and Grant Heslov offers the actors an outline and some functional scenes mostly two-handers.But at some point during filming in Germany and England Clooney mustve realized behind the camera that his own script needed another rewrite or two to make dramatic and comic sense of its mission. ""All hells broken loose here"" his character says at one point traveling through another frontline scene of mass destruction. You see it you dont feel it and while itd be crazy to expect a movie such as ""The Monuments Men"" to dive into wartime miseries its calculated breeziness veers perilously close to a State Department tour. Its a wonderful subject which makes the engagement level all the more frustrating. The curators architects art historians and artists of the FDR-sanctioned Monuments Fine Arts and Archives crew scrambled around Europe during the war saving what they could finding Nazi-looted and culturally priceless Rembrandts and Picassos and frescoes many of them crated deep within Hitlers salt mines.Largely fictionalized the film compresses events and cooks up dramatic death scenes even as it asks the audience to chuckle through a scene of Damons character trapped atop an unexploded land mine. That scene is followed abruptly by the discovery of barrels of gold teeth extracted from Jewish concentration camp prisoners. The change-up is jarring intentionally. The effect feels misjudged.Clooney plays a Harvard art historian based on George Stout a World War I veteran returning to the fields and villages of battle with a different objective this time. Hes the ringleader and once he enlists James Granger (Damon playing a character loosely inspired by James Rorimer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art) its a matter of lining up the best character men for the job. Murrays introduced atop a Chicago skyscraper with the Wrigley Building and Tribune Tower behind him. He plays an architect borrowing a bit of real-life architect Robert Poseys story. One of the peculiarities of ""The Monuments Men"" is its generic texture; the mens specific skills and interests are largely washed over.Clooneys work as a director includes ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and ""The Ides of March"" good films all. He also directed the period football comedy ""Leatherheads"" proving his fallibility. ""The Monuments Men"" deals in an entirely different genre but theres a similar tonal indecision at work here. Now and then the film goes for the jugular emotionally speaking as when Murrays architect tears up listening to his familys homemade recording of ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" That scene should kill yet somehow it doesnt. Its not Murrays fault The scene needed a simpler straighter attack not all the fancy intercutting with field hospital trauma footage. Realism schmealism This is a Hollywood movie. But that sort of scene takes you out of the movie youre trying to invest in. The actors are quite marvelous and a brief sequence featuring ""Downton Abbeys"" Bonneville as dissolute art lover out for redemption in which he asks a superior officer for permission to go into Bruges and save a Madonna provides exactly what the rest of the movie lacks -- namely some snap. Clooney acts with more charm than urgency in ""The Monuments Men."" Hes a far better actor than many realize; he makes everything look easy. But this time he really does just sort of George-Clooney his way through. See John Frankenheimers ""The Train"" again the one with Burt Lancaster for a wholly different and genuinely exciting perspective on the same historical outrage. mjphillipstribune.com""The Monuments Men"" - 2 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for some images of war violence and historical smoking)Running time 150Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Arts and Culture George Clooney Architecture Unrest Conflicts and War The Monuments Men REVIEW The Lego Movie  Latest movie reviews The Monuments Men Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-monuments-men-20140204,0,2628484.column",200,themonumentsmen38,themonumentsmen,chicagotribune

"Review The Monuments Men 3 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Review The Monuments Men 3 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Most wanted works Clooney casts dad in cameo The real Monuments Men Allstar cast Clooney related to character By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Feb 6 2014 327 PM Whatever his reputation off-screen when it comes to directing movies George Clooney is a conservative at heart. ""The Monuments Men"" is the latest example. (""Leatherheads"" and ""The Ides of March"" are others.) Clooney has brought together a great cast including himself Matt Damon Bill Murray and Cate Blanchett to tell one of the more interesting sagas of World War II A U.S. contingent of art experts was sent to Europe to find and return the priceless works the Nazis were stealing and later destroying. (Clooney also co-wrote the script based on the book by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter.) But the film never quite takes off particularly given the talent involved. Clooney is paying obvious homage to old war movies right down to Alexandre Desplats jaunty old-school score. But Clooney never quite finds the balance between the earnest do-gooding and the broader comedy hes seeking to find. If you have Bill Murray aboard and you need to shoot a few scenes about men ill-suited to basic training well come on George have you never seen ""Stripes?"" Clooney plays Frank Stokes who at the beginning of the film convinces FDR that although the war must be won the great masterworks that Hitler is plundering cant be ignored. The art is evidence of our humanity of the best that civilization has to offer. This will not be the last time Stokes gives a version of this speech. The president signs on so Stokes soon is recruiting James Granger (Damon) an art restorer; Richard Campbell (Murray) an architect; Walter Garfield (John Goodman) a sculptor; Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) an art historian; Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville) a disgraced British drunk looking for a shot at redemption; and Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) a French art dealer. The war is winding down but because the art experts may potentially face combat situations they have to undergo basic training. Or so were told. Mostly we see Garfield crawling on his ample belly surprised to learn the rounds being fired above him are live. This serves to illustrate what we already know These men are not soldiers. Once theyre as fit for battle as theyll ever be the men break up into groups and scour Europe for the artwork. This turns the film into a kind of series of mini-buddy movies some better than others. Granger the youngest of the bunch is dispatched to Paris where he must win the trust of Claire Simone (Blanchett quite good) a Resistance sympathizer who worked for the Nazis and documented every work of art they stole. Shes certain the Americans once they find the art will keep it for themselves. No thats the Russians. They keep what they find as reparation. So not only do Stokes men have to fend off Germans they also have to beat the Russians to the loot. Dont be mistaken theres some good stuff here. Clooney is great in a scene in which Stokes sits across a table from a Nazi goon and dismantles him bit by crushing bit with nothing more than words and his first cigarette. But there also are scenes like one set in Germany during the Battle of the Bulge with Murray and Balaban (who are supposed to be at odds) warming up to each other and then seeing firsthand the cost of war that plays like something out of an episode of ""MASH."" It was a great show but with these actors and this story you expect something better. (""MASH"" in fact did this kind of scene more effectively.) It comes down to a matter of tone and Clooney cant really settle on one. ""The Monuments Men"" is in no way a bad movie. Just with this bunch a disappointing one.

But on the list of things that mean something to human lives across centuries it ranks pretty high. Thats whats so compelling about the story of the Monuments Men a group of people from 13 nations who volunteered to protect cultural treasures from destruction during World War II. Most of us like to think wed stride into a combat zone to save a distressed child. But would we do the same for a Michelangelo Madonna? A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - You can see why George Clooney director and star of The Monuments Men would be attracted to these comparatively unheralded heroes particularly as Robert M. Edsel (with Bret Witter) presents them in his gloriously readable 2009 book of the same name. Edsel focuses on the eight men among them museum curators and art historians who trekked to Europe at the tail end of the war ""to inspect and preserve"" every important work of art or architecture in the path of the Allied forces between the English Channel and Berlin -- and as it turns out ended up saving hundreds of stolen works that Hitlers troops had amassed for a grand museum to be built in the Fuhrers honor in Austria.History politics and civic ideals are catnip to Clooney the director and following those interests led him to make the finest of his five pictures (Good Night and Good Luck) as well as a stolid not terrifically memorable one (The Ides of March). Whats more Edsels account of the Monuments Mens subtle heroics features a character Clooney was born to play Harvard art conservator George S. Stout the man responsible for assembling this corps of trained specialists a pencil-mustached gent whose uniform was neatly pressed even under the most trying conditions.Film Details The Monuments Men RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time110 More Info Trailer But The Monuments Men either despite its clearly noble intentions or because of them stumbles on the march. Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov embellish rearrange and condense many of the details. They also change the names of the characters reduce their number to seven and turn them into composites none of which is a problem. But Clooney cant control the story; it keeps flying out of his grasp like an unruly spring. The Monuments Men feels loose and disorganized even though all the requisite cogs (including a jaunty ascot of a score by Alexandre Desplat) have been accounted for.At least Clooney finds glory in the corners. His great skill as a director may be his affinity for actors. The performers in a Clooney-directed movie nearly always have some quiet sparkle about them. Onscreen here Clooney though dashing is more an emcee than a central figure. He has also taken the liberty of pairing characters off into unlikely twosomes and as these duos set out to face both the usual and some unexpected dangers those chemistry experiments pay off. John Goodman (as a jolly sculptor) and Jean Dujardin (an unidentified art expert type really just the movies token French charmer) head out in a jeep as if on a lark eventually reaching a field populated by a single magnificent horse. Dujardin leaps from the truck to say hello though he has nothing to offer his new friend but a cigarette (wisely rejected). The moment is wonderful a meeting of two long-legged movie-star beauties.Less dazzling but possibly more complex is the tentative tango between Matt Damon (a medieval art expert) and Cate Blanchett (an icy French secretary who seems to have more feeling for art than people). Damons character has more down-home charm than youd expect from a medieval art guy but you believe in him anyway and Blanchett gives a slightly stylized performance that opens out like a cautious morning glory.Hugh Bonneville has some nicely tuned moments as an art enthusiast with a lifelong affection for the Madonna of Bruges the only Michelangelo sculpture to leave Italy during the artists lifetime. Clooney plays fast and loose with some of the facts here but he wisely takes note of one real-life detail German soldiers -- at that point in the war retreating and desperate and therefore perhaps even more driven to please their leader -- stole the Madonna by wrapping her in mattresses and hustling her away in a Red Cross truck a dirty trick even for Nazis.The finest scenes belong to Bob Balaban as a cranky unspecified expert at something-or-other and Bill Murray who plays a renowned architect -- thats pretty hilarious casting though somehow it works. Balabans character disgruntled that hes only a private wants little to do with anyone else least of all loosey-goosey Murray. Still as both people and movie characters do they forge a friendship out of dirty looks and grumbling. Hunkered down in an army encampment they huddle over packages sent from home Balabans contains crackers a gift that delights him; his features previously so pinched and cranky suddenly seem lit from within. Murrays contains a recording made by his daughter and grandchildren but he needs a record player to hear it and good luck finding one of those. The actors then share one of those graceful underplayed moments that you remember long after your memories of an otherwise not-great movie have dimmed. The Monuments Men fails in its grand ambitions but its still satisfying in bits and pieces like a busted statue. Even a tribute made of shining fragments counts for something.1 Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett.

At the same time however his handsome visage has grown steadily worse for wear as he has mellowed into middle age -- and the movies have followed suit. The result has been a decidedly tamer if never entirely dismissible pop culture artist intermittently successful at making smarter Hollywood movies. While his Charlie Kaufman-scripted ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" had experimental bite and the superbly restrained ""Good Night and Good Luck"" explored its topic with oodles of intellectual elan the earnestly upbeat sports comedy ""Leatherheads"" flopped hard and ""The Ides of March"" displayed its ""all-politicians-are-monsters"" polemic a little too broadly. But like Clooneys slick grin the later movies reflect an eagerness to satisfy audience expectations on par with attempts by the earlier ones to challenge them. At first shrewdly unconventional Clooneys storytelling abilities have been steadily declining to middlebrow stature. Now comes ""The Monuments Men"" Clooneys first completed feature since he turned 50 and certainly his most idealistic work a sincere ode to art scholars recruited in WWII to salvage European masterworks pilfered by the Nazis. The story co-scripted by Clooney and Grant Heslov from Robert M. Edsels non-fiction tome goes down smoothly enough if youre willing to tolerate its softball treatment. Clooneys treatment of the material takes from of a goofy ensemble and whimsical ebullience seemingly borrowed from Wes Andersons cabinet (Bill Murray and Bob Balaban as two experts awkwardly paired together make a particularly delectable odd couple that could carry their own spin-off). Alexadre Desplats upbeat soundtrack and Phedon Papamichaels vibrant cinematography complete the glossy treatment. Far from a great war movie ""The Monuments Men"" is routinely entertaining in its simplistic vision of history which also makes it entirely disposable. Though a joint production of Sony and 20th Century Fox ""Monuments Men"" has the old-fashioned temperament of a classic Disney production and the patriotic air of a classic wartime ""Why We Fight"" propaganda short It opens with a bearded Clooney as mission leader George L. Stout laying out the case for rescuing fine art before the end of the war while a silhouetted FDR listens closely on the edge of the frame. Yet Clooney is ostensibly narrating his interest in the material so he may as well be addressing us when he softly intones ""Who will make sure Michaelantelos David is still standing is Mona Lisa is smiling?"" Its a line practically begging to be delivered in singsong as part of a call and response chant The Monuments Men thats who The blithe attitude continues over the title credits during which Clooney surfaces around the country to recruit various craftsmen and researchers from portly sculptor Walter Garfield (John Goodman) to French designer Jean-Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin). Because theres little sense for these men as people their first appearance together in a briefing session has thin sitcom-like parameters funny in theory but out of whack with the context. During a slide show in which they learn about Hitlers plans to stock a massive ""Fuhrer museum"" with stolen art and critique the dictators early attempts at his own paintings the Monuments Men come across as a group of would-be Gomer Pyles -- which is part of the joke of course though as that tone continues it comes at the expense of giving this weird-but-true historical footnote much staying power. Notwithstanding the appeal of the aforementioned Murray-Balaban pairing ""Monuments Men"" rarely maintains the storys fundamentally intriguing premise a bunch of art history buffs running through wartorn Europe. Instead its a tame affable overview of the events minus much of their depth. One side plot involving the efforts by American agent James Rorimer (Matt Damon) to locate the Nazis treasure trove of stolen goods -- working alongside Parisian bookkeeper Rose Valland (a typically fierce but underutilized Cate Blanchett) -- draws some appeal from their romantic possibilities but ultimately goes nowhere. Similarly various shootouts and internal strategy sessions among the men have a monotonous calculated quality as if Clooney and Heslov decided at a certain point simply to run their scenario through a war movie filter that only cuts surface deep. Occasionally their script brightens up with fleeting references to the tragedies surrounding them (""The Nazis took better care of paintings than people"" asserts one of the men) but overall ""The Monuments Men"" views its fascinating topic with an altogether frustrating degree of neatness even when members of its troop perish in the line of duty. In fact the death is part of an all-too-obvious design The movies collection of tame storytelling ingredients -- toothless battle scenes galvanizing speeches -- reach an apex when the music swells to uplifting effect in the closing scene set in the present day and meant as a tribute to the intentions of the fallen men. Its Clooneys first bonafide stab at a Spielberg moment an attempt to render a dour subject in sugary feel-good terms. Due to the unquestionably profound implications of its characters mission ""The Monuments Men"" succeeds at doing that much while creating a distancing effect through its rosy lens. Smothered by its lighthearted approach ""The Monuments Men"" attempts to make a grand statement about the valiance of dying for the sake of art but fails to create it. Criticwire Grade C+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? Opening nationwide this week ""The Monuments Men"" is unlikely to leave a huge dent at the box office especially given competition from ""The Lego Movie."" It could prover more formidable overseas aided by a premiere slot at the upcoming Berlin International Film Festival.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Museum Piece The stiff stuffy The Monuments Men. By David Edelstein Published Feb 2 2014 ShareThis The Monuments Men George Clooneys The Monuments Men tells the true (if embellished) story of a squad of art experts tasked to protect masterpieces of European society from Nazi theft and Allied bombardment at the end of World War IIa story that might be expected (in this country anyway) to elicit responses like Okay but it seems weird to worry about paintings when millions of people are dying. Clooneywho directed co-wrote and stars in the filmclearly anticipates such Yankee anti-elitism. He opens with a scene in which his character Frank Stokes makes the case to FDR (we view the back of the presidents head) that such works are the very foundation of the civilization that the United States seeks to protect. As the Allies drop bombs on cities in Germany Italy and France he asks Who will make sure that the statue of David is still standing and the Mona Lisa still smiling? Later he labors to make the same case to commanding officers on the front lines men obviously racked by the loss of Allied lives and incredulous (and indignant) at his request to stop shelling their art-filled targets. In a pep talk to his own men Stokes avers that if these countries achievements and history are destroyed its like they never existed. I emphasize Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslovs speechifying on behalf of their heroes mission to suggest why The Monuments Men never quite shakes off its family-friendly squareness. Its a graceful engaging filmI enjoyed it. But it could have been called The Tasteful Dozen. After helping to shape such acid anti-imperialist movies as Syriana and David O. Russells Three Kings Clooney must have been eager to make a hopeful positive war picture with a lighthearted marching-drum-and-woodwind score by Alexander Desplatand an implicit subtext that government funding of the arts is vital to our very existence. But he plays it so safe. Perhaps fearful of being called exploitative he doesnt bring out the tension between timeless masterpieces and the chaos and obscenity of war. He doesnt even linger on the paintings and sculptures which seem like fodder MacGuffins. And he panders to the mainstream audience. Its only when the Monuments Men come up against snipers and murderous commandants that Stokes announces theyve earned the right to wear their uniforms. But if they need to take bullets to prove theyre soldiers what are all those high-flown speeches about preserving civilization about? The all-star ensemble is at half-mast though its hard to resist them. How can you not be charmed by the assembling-the-team sequence in which Matt Damon is plucked from atop a ladder as he works on a church ceiling and Bill Murray from leading a tour of a skyscraper? Alcoholic Hugh Bonneville has a chance to come back from disgrace and redeem himself heart-wrenchingly. John Goodman gets a laugh by shrugging off basic training and waddling through an obstacle course while bullets fly around him. Jean Dujardin is the happy Frenchie Bob Balaban the serious specialist who trades low-wattage insults with Murray. The pair has a good scene in which they visit a man with ties to Frances art world and discover some extraordinarily well-done reproductions on the walls. A little too well-done. There were worse crimes in the forties than stealing paintings but low thievery of high art earns its own circle of hell. At the inner circle of course is Hitler who made Aryan culture a centerpiece of his Reich and directed Nazi soldiers to make off with every well-regarded painting and sculpture they could get their mitts on plundering not just museums but the homes of deported Jews. The scale of that plunder is laid out in the 2006 documentary The Rape of Europa and thrillingly evoked in John Frankenheimers The Train featuring Paul Scofield as an art-obsessed Nazi and Burt Lancaster as the stationmaster bent on keeping Frances masterworks from reaching Germany. In The Monuments Men its seen through the eyes of Cate Blanchett as a prim bespectacled French curator who secretly plots against a piggy S.S. man preparing trainloads of art for the Fuhrers proposed Uber-museum. (Now and then there are shots of a diminutive Hitler staring at a model of this monument to himself.) Earnest Damon has to prove to Blanchett that hes not rounding up paintings to ship back to America and when shes satisfied that his aim is art for arts sake she lets down her hair and wants into his pants. Alas hes been staring too long at church frescoes. I cant predict if there will be a huge audience for The Monuments Men but in its way its a great piece of escapism. As Iraq explodes (we broke it we didnt buy it) and Afghanistan metes out madness and death once again to hubristic occupiers World War II grows even larger in our hearts. Clooney wants us to agree that liberating the Madonna of Ghent from godless Nazi murderers was maybe our last selfless act as a nation in the theater of war. Its a pipe dream of decency in a world that has lost its moral compass. 1 2 Next Share this story...

The Monuments Men By Peter Travers January 31 2014 More News 2013s Best Movies All Stories >> Leave it to George clooney to kick Hitlers ass. In The Monuments Men he kicks hard. But not in the way you think. Its all part of the retro fun and addictive adventure in this relatively bloodless World War II epic. Clooney who directed The Monuments Men from a script he wrote with his producing partner Grant Heslov is riled up about the masterpieces of painting and sculpture that the Fuhrer annexed for himself as his armies goose-stepped across Europe. Quentin Tarantino bashed Nazi skulls in Inglourious Basterds. Clooney sees his film as more of a Nazi mindfuck. What if he and his actor pals including Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman Jean Dujardin Bob Balaban and Hugh Bonneville played aging artists historians and museum geeks who head for the front lines to outwit the German high command by stealing back that art? Its like an Oceans Eleven heist but this time in uniforms and helmets. More News 2013s Best Movies All Stories >> And so we watch this over-the-hill gang egged on by composer Alexandre Desplats jaunty marching theme prep for bullets and shelling theyre not remotely equipped to handle. The mood is set for a highspirited free-for-all. And for a while thats what we get. But then comes - wait for it - a tone shift that may leave escapism junkies feeling betrayed. It turns out Clooney is hunting bigger game something thoughtful touching and true. You heard me I said true. The plot only sounds improbable. Its fact-based. Clooneys source material is Robert Edsels 2010 book The Monuments Men Allied Heroes Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History. The MFAA (Monuments Fine Arts and Archives) unit really was tasked by FDR with the support of Gen. Eisenhower to rescue these masterpieces and to protect them from bombs the enemys and our own. Who knew? The work of the Monuments Men is fresh territory for film and Clooney builds the story with intriguing detail and scope. Does he change names and futz with facts to protect innocent audiences who only want a good time? Sure. As a co-producer of Argo last years Oscar-winning Best Picture Clooney did the same thing. But the changes arent severe enough to get his dramatic license revoked. Plus theres no question that Clooneys heart is with this ragtag band of brothers. Hitler had decreed that if he died and the war was lost nearly 5 million pieces of stolen art should be destroyed. Its his or nobodys. Screw that said the Monuments Men. Not on their watch. Its a kick gawking at stellar actors getting their blood up. Clooney excels as MFAA leader Frank Stokes a character inspired by George Stout who was doing art restoration at Harvards Fogg Museum when duty called. Its Stokes who recruits James Granger (Damon) based on James J. Rorimer who went on to be director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The bantering between Clooney and Damon gives the film a buoyant lift but the seriousness of their mission is never in doubt. In occupied Paris Granger finds a crucial ally in Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) a curator at the Jeu de Paume a museum that the Nazis use as a repository for stolen art. Its Simone based on French Resistance leader Rose Valland who keeps a record of where each piece is being routed. The rest of the actors also have real-life counterparts. Murray and Balaban have the most fun playing off their differences in height and attitude. Murray portrays architect Richard Campbell much like Robert Posey who discovered the salt mine at Altaussee where the Nazis had hidden many great works. Balaban takes the role of dandyish art connoisseur Preston Savitz much like Lincoln Kirstein the future co-founder of the New York City Ballet. Both assigned to Pattons Third Army they put aside their bickering to search for the ""Ghent Altarpiece."" Also buddying up are Goodman as combat-unready Walter Garfield based on sculptor Walker Hancock and Dujardin (Goodmans co-star in The Artist) as a French Jew whose bond with Garfield grows as danger approaches. Everyone relies on Dimitri Leonidas as Pvt. Sam Epstein a German-Jewish teen based on the still-living Harry Ettlinger who served as driver and translator for the men. There are enough stories here to fill a dozen movies. Few are more affecting than the tale of Donald Jeffries a Brit with the rank of major much like English art historian Ronald Balfour. As played by Bonneville (Lord Grantham on Downton Abbey) Jeffries finds a goal outside the bottle in his search for the ""Bruges Madonna"" by Michelangelo. The physical production is exquisite with cinematographer Phedon Papamichael an Oscar nominee for Nebraska shooting on locations in Germany and England that stand in for a whole world at war. Is there sex? Well Damon and Blanchett have a flirty scene in a Paris apartment. But the real romance emerges when the men get up close and personal with the works of Da Vinci Rembrandt Van Eyck and Vermeer. The artifacts are copies of course but the actors regard each painting as if theyre basking in a radiant sun. In their search for looted art in mines and secret caves the Monuments Men also discovered a Nazi stash of gold bullion. The gold got all the press. It still does. Look at the movie business. But dont look here. Not in this proudly untrendy uncynical movie. OK the period dialogue (""Hey fellas youre a sight for sore eyes"") is cornball. Ditto the emotions that well up when the men hear a Christmas song. But Clooney feels theres much to be learned from these unsung art warriors. Going deeper is a Clooney signature. As the director of Good Night and Good Luck he looked for integrity in TV journalism. In The Ides of March he searched for remnants of morality in politics. In The Monuments Men he finds value in asking a question Is saving art worth the sacrifice of a human life? A provocation? You bet. A surefire box-office recipe? Probably not. And yet the issues raised by the film remain sadly relevant. Check out the looting of the National Museum in Baghdad. What Clooney has crafted in The Monuments Men is a movie about aspiration about culture at risk about things worth fighting for. Id call that timely and well worth a salute.

Multihyphenate George Clooneys true-life WWII adventure--a frustrating tonal mishmash--puts the question up front as curator and conservationist Frank Stokes (Clooney) lays it all out for President Roosevelt Hitler and his cronies have stolen tons of the great works (Picasso Vermeer Van Eyck) and its imperative to retrieve them. ""If you destroy an entire generation of peoples culture its as if they never existed"" he says to a skeptical FDR whos more concerned with flesh and blood than he is with oil on canvas. Still the POTUS permits Stokes to convene a ragtag team of operatives to salvage what they can as U.S. forces push in from Normandy. You might think youre watching Stripes as opposed to Saving Private Ryan as the group gathers for a broadly comic basic-training sequence. Here are the out-of-shape Ugly Americans (Bill Murray John Goodman and Bob Balaban). There is the Englishman (Hugh Bonneville) tempted by drink the Frenchman (Jean Dujardin) with the slyly salacious grin and the green German expat (Dimitri Leonidas) who proves himself a battlefield asset. And finally comes an especially bland Matt Damon as an art restorer trying to woo resistance fighter Cate Blanchett (doing her Kate Hepburn in The Aviator with a Gallic burr). Things dont exactly improve once the action shifts entirely to European soil. Ostensibly funny interludes like Murray and Balabans culture-clash encounter with a rogue SS soldier bump uneasily against rank sentimental scenes such as a remember-home montage cringingly scored to ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" Yet Clooney occasionally shows a surer hand He gets great work from Downton Abbeys Bonneville--notably in an emotionally charged scene revolving around Michelangelos Madonna of Bruges--and has a fine monologue himself in which Stokes dresses down a high-ranking German commander (a moving encapsulation of the American spirit at its best). You wish that sober confidence extended to the rest of the film which is otherwise content to be another slipshod and banal if always watchable Hollywood co-opting of history.

Our government wasnt always so lax when it came to preserving cultural artifacts as George Clooneys ""The Monuments Men"" goes out of its way to remind us. In the waning days of World War II as Nazi dreams of glory were fading a squadron of U.S. art historians tracked down and saved countless paintings and sculptures (to say nothing of church bells and copies of the Torah) from Hitlers ""Nero strategy"" wherein the retreating German troops would scorch as much earth (figuratively and literally) as they could. The notion of architects sculptors and academics sent to basic training and unleashed upon the theater of war promises to deliver both comedy and action but Clooney (who directed and co-adapted Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witters non-fiction book with Grant Heslov) never strikes the storytelling balance that the material deserves. At times the film drags while at others it rushes through essential character and story elements. Also read Monuments Men 2013 Treasure Trove of Stolen Nazi Art Discovered Clooney (sporting a Ronald Colman haircut and mustache) stars as Frank Stokes who convinces FDR that preserving priceless art treasures from the Nazis is important enough to merit effort on the part of the Allies. At first Stokes warns of the ""Fuhrer Museum"" in which Hitler plans to show off the spoils of his war; later it becomes clear that whatever the Nazis cant keep theyll destroy even if it means the elimination of one-of-a-kind pieces from Michelangelo and other legends. (Pieces by contemporary artists like Pablo Picasso and Max Ernst were immediately torched by the Reich as decadent creations.) Stokes assembles a ragtag bunch including Matt Damon as an art restorer Bob Balaban as a historian Bill Murray as an architect John Goodman as a sculptor Cate Blanchett as a French ""collaborator"" whos been keeping her eye on the masterpieces Jean Dujardin as a man who looks good in a beret and Hugh Bonneville as a disgraced alcoholic seeking one last shot at redemption. Id mention the character names but we dont ever really get to know these men which is one of the movies biggest problems. Also read Monuments Men Star Bill Murray Wants to Legalize Pot 9 Other Things We Learned About the Elusive Actor on Reddit ""The Monuments Men"" rushes through the preliminary exposition and dispenses with their training in one quick montage so by the time the squad breaks up into pairs and disperses throughout the continent we dont know them well enough to be amused by their interactions. (Theres a running gag about how bad Damons French is but it goes from amusing to irritating after excessive repetition.) It might have benefited Clooney and Heslov to spend a little more time on the set-up and less on the saving-the-art scenes which grow a bit logy and repetitive. Pacing aside however Clooney definitely gets the old-school vibe down from the zippy repartee to Alexandre Desplats vintage-sounding score equal parts gung-ho and whoop-dee-doo. In a way its too bad that Clooneys debut directorial effort the genuinely weird ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" wasnt a hit because that films lack of success seems to have driven him to play it much safer behind the camera. The stodginess of ""Good Night and Good Luck."" worked because its stiffness matched the early TV that was its subject but with ""Leatherheads"" ""The Ides of March"" and now ""Monuments Men"" you can feel Clooneys timidity as a filmmaker. Also read George Clooney Struggles With Tone of Monuments Men Its Been a Bit of a Dance (Exclusive) Theres not a single visual jolt or surprise to be found here -- not that theres necessarily anything wrong with that but Clooneys visual straightforwardness only underscores the scripts weaknesses. Theres nothing wrong with wanting to make a World War II picture thats closer to Howard Hawks than to Quentin Tarantino but those classics at their best really knew how to tell a story. Clooney has a great yarn here but his spinning gets tangled. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Its not only the great works of European art that have gone missing in ""The Monuments Men""; the spark of writer-director-star George Clooneys filmmaking is absent too. In adapting writer Robert M. Edsels account of the men charged with protecting the Western worlds aesthetic treasures from wartime destruction Clooney has transformed a fascinating true-life tale into an exceedingly dull and dreary caper pic cum art-appreciation seminar -- a museum-piece movie about museum people. Fronting an all-star cast and top-drawer craft contributions in every department this expensive-looking Sony/Fox co-production should outpace the 75 million worldwide gross of Clooneys previous turn in the directors chair (2011s ""The Ides of March"") but doesnt amount to more than a footnote in his remarkable filmography. When Clooney started out as a director it was clear hed learned a great deal about technique from his many collaborations with Steven Soderbergh and his first two features ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" (2002) and ""Good Night and Good Luck"" (2005) were compelling evidence that the pupil might be as good as the master. Though wildly divergent in tone both those movies were inventive biopics set against the backdrop of live television production -- a world Clooney grew up in -- and ""Confessions"" in particular seemed informed stylistically by the fast pace and self-reflexivity of live TV. But ""The Ides of March"" and now ""The Monuments Men"" are likes movies made by someone else dutiful establishment prestige pictures with ""big"" ideas communicated in thuddingly literal fashion. In short if Clooney started out as Soderbergh somewhere along the way he seems to have turned into 80s-era Norman Jewison. In between ""Good Night"" and ""Ides"" Clooney made ""Leatherheads"" a stab at 30s screwball comedy that was reliably a half-beat off from Howard Hawks rhythms. And with ""The Monuments Men"" Clooney seems to be aiming for something faintly Hawksian again casting himself in the role of Frank Stokes the Fogg Museum art historian who conceives of the Monuments Fine Arts and Archives (MFAA) program and ultimately finds himself running it. The time is the spring of 1944 a few weeks after Allied bombers destroyed a fifth-century abbey at Monte Cassino in Italy mistakenly believing it to be a Nazi stronghold and despite a presidential order stating that important historical and artistic sites were not to be bombed. The only solution Stokes (whos based on the real Fogg curator and conservationist George Stout) proposes is to create an elite corps of art-world experts wholl travel to the front lines and advise those in command while also working to recover the thousands of artworks stolen by the Nazis from private Jewish collections and museums alike -- many of them destined for Hitlers planned Fuehrermuseum in his hometown of Linz. So like a paintbrush-toting Nick Fury Stokes sets about assembling his team expert art restorer James Granger (Matt Damon); Chicago architect Richard Campbell (Bill Murray); sculptor Walter Garfield (John Goodman); theater impresario Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban); a disgraced British museum head (Hugh Bonneville) in need of a second chance; and a former Ecole des Beaux-Arts painting instructor (Jean Dujardin) from gay Paris. Middle-aged and out of shape they stick out like a Picasso in the Cloisters when they show up for basic training in England but then theyve been recruited for their brains not their brawn. For all its talk about art being ""the very foundation of modern society"" and solemn sermonizing like ""Who will make sure the statue of David is still standing the Mona Lisa still smiling?"" its one of the curiosities of ""The Monuments Men"" that so few pieces of art actually appear onscreen in the course of the movies two hours. For much of that time our heroes travel hither and yon on the trail of two particular masterpieces Michelangelos marble-sculpted Madonna of Bruges and Flemish masters Hubert and Jan van Eycks 12-panel altarpiece ""The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb"" both seized by the Germans during the war. But aside from those treasures themselves glimpsed only fleetingly the movie tends to talk about art in general rather than specific terms. The MFAA men themselves are rendered similarly vague. Whereas Edsels book bristled with vivid individuals many of them friends or foes from their civilian art-world lives the characters Clooney and regular screenwriting partner Grant Heslov have made from them feel sketched-in at best as if it their personalities had been traded away along with their real names. Indeed just about everything Clooney and Heslov have done to make Edsels sprawling narrative more coherent and cinematic has the effect of simply making things bland. Largely gone is the lively battlefield bickering between Monuments and Army men over the relative value of art and human life replaced by such hackneyed invented scenes as the one in which a Monuments Man bravely sacrifices himself in a failed effort to save the Madonna. (In reality a couple of MFAA workers died in the combat zone but none quite so romantically.) Its like a men-on-a-mission movie tailor-made for audiences who found ""Inglourious Basterds"" too irreverent. Clooneys Stokes is like a tamer version of the acerbic Special Forces officer he played in another wartime treasure hunt David O. Russells ""Three Kings"" -- the kind of debonair wizened man of the world Clooney can act in his sleep (which he sometimes seems to be doing here). Damon meanwhile is altogether too laid-back for a man who supposedly spends his days making infinitesimal touch-ups to decaying artistic masterworks. His poor command of French becomes one of the movies labored running jokes but no one ever mentions Cate Blanchetts tortured Gallic accent as Claire Simone an assistant curator at Paris Jeu de Paume museum who knows more about the stolen arts whereabouts than she initially lets on fearing that the Americans may simply steal everything for themselves. (Blanchetts character is based on Rose Valland whose own memoir served as the basis for John Frankenheimers ""The Train"" an equally fictionalized but far more exciting take on these events and one of the great action movies of the 60s.) Faring generally better are Murray and Balaban who foster a nicely understated comic chemistry and seem to have decided to make the most of their underwritten scenes. In one of the only moments of ""The Monuments Men"" that strikes a real chord Murray receives a homemade recording of his grandchildren singing ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" and Clooney holds on the actors wonderfully emotive face as Balaban plays the record for him over the barracks PA. The real Monuments Men were men of great passion and senses of duty who risked their own lives for art but the film Clooney and Heslov has made is an oddly bloodless and conventional tribute dutifully winding its way toward an obvious destination with the expected parade of historical signposts lots of onscreen titles to signal the passage of time; occasional glimpses of Hitler looming over a scale model of the Fuehrermuseum; the issuance of the 1945 ""Nero Decree"" stating that if Hitler dies or Germany falls all the stolen art will be destroyed. Through it all the movie never really springs to life and thats a particular disappointment coming from Clooney whos smart and tasteful and one of the only people in todays Hollywood who could get a project like ""The Monuments Men"" off the ground in the first place. In the end the art is recovered but the movie itself remains entombed. The extensive special-effects work that reportedly held up the pics release from Christmas of last year is in the end seamless to behold. Composer Alexandre Desplat who contributes one of his most conventional scores -- a John Williams-esque Americana fanfare -- also appears in a small role as one of Damons contacts in the French resistance. Heslov cameos as an Army surgeon while Clooneys father Nick appears as an aged Stokes in a 1970s epilogue. Film Review The Monuments MenReviewed at Sony Pictures screening room New York Jan. 27 2014.

Marita says February 21 2014 at 1220 am First I most say that I am not an American person.... I am a Latina immigrant- Now after I have seen this film and liked very much and have read your evaluation I will remember your name for the next movie you will critic  when you will say about a film is bad I will go sure thinking I will like the film.The opposite you will say ....will be a good movie for mi... Sorry for my honesty... Reply Dunkin says February 22 2014 at 721 am Marita film is art and is very subjective. I am happy that you like the film. I like the cast fantastic actors. However a fantastic historic event like this should have been done better. It should have been more interesting instead of slow and discombobulated a great historic event deserves this. If you want to see an amazing film see THE PIANIST with Adrian Brody if you havent already. I appreciate your remarks ) Reply Bored Moviegoer says February 15 2014 at 1041 pm This movie was so boring and disjointed I wanted to leave after the first 20 - 30 minutes. I was with friends who seemed more engaged so leaving early woulda been rude. Actually I would have skipped this movie from the get-go had I known what it was about BEFORE buying the ticket. Ill be more inquisitive next time. Reply Dunkin says February 10 2014 at 603 am Big disappointment I expected it because almost every time an actor tries to direct this happens. The directing and writing was awful and the film just couldnt engage the audience. There were about three humorous moments and I did wake up for those. They should have stuck to more comedy which might have saved this wasted effort. I believe that with a bit of re-writing and a seasoned ""DIRECTOR"" the film could have been a mega hit. Reply MirrorGirl says February 10 2014 at 1241 am This film was a sad disappointment. It just didnt work veering from halfway serious to merry hi-jinks in a second neither of which came off all of which giving me tonal whiplash. And the score about drove me nuts with its heavy-handed cues. And youre right; Blanchetts accent was awful The bad accent combined with her sepulchral tone and brittle performance had me shaking my head. Couldnt they find a French actress in you know France?? A rare misstep from Clooney. Reply MKC says February 9 2014 at 616 pm A bit harsh but all valid points except for the barb thrown at Cates accent. I too was amazed that there was so little art in a film about art. The pic looks great especially the night exteriors and I actually enjoyed it despite its flaws but I am an art geek so take it with a grain... The last line of the review should have the word ""needless"" before the word ""epilogue."" Reply ITTTY IT says February 9 2014 at 437 am Hollywood stepped over the awesomely relevant 60th Anniversary of the KOREAN WAR to bring us reheated tripe like this? Reply Hg Wells says February 8 2014 at 233 pm Too bad the movie itself is getting so many poor reviews because the story of the Monuments Men is interesting as is its time in history. I am personally looking forward to a related book The Noble Sculptor (website of the same name) that is coming out. I am on the list to know when the book is released. It has a story of one of the Monuments Men in Italy but the real story is about that Monuments Mans father who was a hero during WWII at the time. He was credited with saving over 600 Allied troops trying to escape the Germans in Italy. To me that does sound more interesting and likely a much better movie. Reply Jeff knapp says February 8 2014 at 1240 pm This was a wonderfully enjoyable movie. it made me want to learn more about these brave men that saved some of the greatest works of art. Reply Lapadite says January 29 2014 at 621 pm Blanchett is known as one of the few English-speaking actresses who is actually very adept at and has an excellent ear for accents and dialects. With respect to this picture Dujardin himself had mention how surprised he was with her so seamlessly inhabiting a French woman of that time the accent the mannerisms etc. She sounds and looks French were his exact words. Hes more credible on the subject than some American critic. Darling Me an ignorant off-base comment. Cate Blanchetts accents in film are praised the various American dialects the Irish the English (modern and old) the Scottish etc. Her Irish accent for Veronica Guerin for instance was praised by Irish public and Irish critics. Reply Scott M says January 29 2014 at 513 pm Why the completely irrelevant snark against Norman Jewison? Did he brush you off at a screening? Do you have some irrational antipathy towards multiple Oscar-winner ""Moonstruck""? Reply cadavra says January 29 2014 at 1008 am Whats so bad about 80s-era Norman Jewison? Certainly superior to a lot of the crap we get nowadays. Reply kenmandu says January 29 2014 at 1216 pm Amen Reply Just Confused says January 29 2014 at 930 am This film still continues to hold my interest. Sometimes informing while entertaining is more than adequate.....and didnt you say there was a book? What a ""novel"" concept if one is still intrigued after they see the movie they could read the book. I think this reviewer was hoping for ""INDIANA JONES MEETS THE MONUMENT MEN""... maybe he could read a comic book or am I....just confused? ;-) Reply mexicoliveitloveit says January 29 2014 at 927 am Not a snore-fest i cant wait til it comes out Its an awesome story. Reply Julienne says January 29 2014 at 923 am Snore-fest Reply Darling Me says January 29 2014 at 923 am Although shes a brilliant actress when will Cate Blanchett and her reps realize that accents arent her thing? Other than British and Australian she doesnt maintain...

TWITTER George Clooney Matt Damon Bill Murray John Goodman Jean Dujardin and Cate Blanchett enter the war zones of Europe in an attempt to rescue Western art from Hitlers hands. Something less than monumental The Monuments Men wears its noble purpose on its sleeve when either greater grit or more irreverence could have spun the same tale to modern audiences with more punch and no loss of import. Agreeably patterned after classic World War II films in which a small unit of guys trumps the enemys best-laid plans George Clooneys fifth big-screen directorial outing is a sympathetic account of the urgent U.S.-led effort to save treasure troves of looted artwork hidden by Nazis who are bent on destroying them as they retreat in defeat. The Sony release is rather too relaxed for its own good suggesting a more modest box office life than its cast might have indicated. Mostly shot in Germany the good-looking drama will have its international premiere at the Berlin Film Festival. PHOTOS Oscars Leonardo DiCaprio Meryl Streep and Other Actor Nominees Spill Secrets Behind Their Roles Postponed from its original year-end release date due to reported delays in completing special effects the film could inadvertently benefit publicity-wise due to the recent discovery in Germany of hitherto unknown collections of art said to have been confiscated before and during the war. This is unlikely to be the last of such findings which merely underlines the magnitude of the difficulty faced by the real-life figures on which the film is based. To be sure its a fascinating story one touched upon in a central way only once before in a major Hollywood movie John Frankenheimers sensationally good The Train starring Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield in 1964. Whereas that was a breathless thriller The Monuments Men is more of a procedural in which a band of middle-aged scholars led by art historian Frank Stokes (played by Clooney as a fictionalized version of Harvard art conservationist George Stout a handsome mustachioed man in real life himself) receive the blessing of FDR himself to enter the war zones of Europe to do what they can to save the Western art Hitler has been amassing to fill his planned Fuhrer Museum in Germany. In short order Stokes puts together a group of guys who are not so much misfits as sedentary smarties too old to be drafted or put through basic training which in fact they have to endure since theyre likely to come under fire. Theres straitlaced art expert James Granger (Matt Damon) architect Richard Campbell (Bill Murray) sculptor Walter Garfield (John Goodman) French art dealer Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin) art historian Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) and British art wingman Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville); theyre joined by a virtual kid Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas) a German Jew who will translate and drive. Clooney and co-writer (and co-producer) Grant Heslov throw in mild humor here and there as these American Wild Geese try to get in shape and Granger who claims to speaks French is continually asked by the French to speak English instead because his French is so bad (they later understand why when he says he learned in Montreal). Arriving on the secured beach at Normandy in July 1944 the men learn that their mission is disdained by local brass who feel that risking any life for the sake of art is absurd. PHOTOS Oscars Jennifer Lawrence Jonah Hill and Other Supporting Actor Nominees Spill Secrets Behind Their Roles In Paris they learn that the national collection is safe but that enormous collections of mostly Jewish-owned art were confiscated by decree. It turns out that the Russians approaching from the East are also trying to track down the art but intend to keep it as recompense for war costs. But where is it? Stokes knows some of the cities where its been stashed but not the exact locations. Which is where Claire Simone (Cate Blanchett) comes in. A prim bespectacled Parisian Claire worked at the Jeu de Paume under the Nazis meticulously documenting the movements of all art objects (Goering was a frequent visitor replenishing his own collection as well as that of the Fuhrer). Unwilling to cooperate with the Yanks at first convinced that theyll just take it all home she finally has a change of heart and in the end yearns only for one night with Damons Granger in exchange for her records. It turns out the loot is mostly hidden in mines so it comes down to a race between the Americans and both the Nazis who would rather burn Picassos rather than have them fall into Allied hands and the Russians who consider it blood money. But the contest is less suspenseful than it is self-sacrificing uplifting and altruistic. No occasion is lost for one of the characters -- most often Stokes -- to deliver a little speech about the civilizing nature of art its incalculable value to the world its importance as a means of defining our culture. To the argument that ""No piece of art is worth a sons life"" The Monuments Men ultimately proposes the contrary because great art should live on as an eternal reminder of what a civilization stands for. Ideally such a message would be implicit rather than so explicitly and repeatedly stated but its as if Clooney and Heslov either underestimate their audience or actually suspect that perhaps not knowing who Rembrandt Renoir Cezanne or even Michelangelo were modern viewers need to be lectured on the importance of high European culture. The film is bracketed by scenes in which Stokes has to convince two different U.S. presidents of the very same. PHOTOS Beginners Luck? Actors Who Scored Oscar Nominations With Film Debuts As the driving impulse behind the project thus seems to have been to honor the men without whom the legacy of Western art might have been gravely compromised it may seem rude to  suggest that the film would have been better had it backpedaled this sentiment in favor of a rougher mixed-mood drama with a more arbitrary and surprising attitude toward life and death -- or a more insouciant comic drama about some guys just getting the job done. Too much of the time The Monuments Men falls into a compromised middle zone not urgent and only mildly amusing. Blanchett gives the most edge to her role but even her character is held back a bit in her dealings with Damons upstanding fellow. Funnymen Murray and Goodman work within a subdued range for them while Damon Balaban Dujardin and the others are fine but do little surprising. Clooney gives most of the uplifting speeches but also has the films best monologue wherein he bluntly tells a captured Nazi bigwig how hell read his brief obituary while having lunch at a Jewish deli when he gets home to New York. Cinematographer Phedon Papamichael production designer Jim Bissell and costume designer Louise Frogley make strong contributions to the films fine look and some good CGI work provides convincing vistas of wartime ruin. Alexandre Desplats score is uncharacteristically sentimental.
