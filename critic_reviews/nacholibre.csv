Cast Jack Black as Brother Ignacio a Mexican monk moonlighting as a masked wrestler to better the lot of the orphanage and youre laughing already. Sadly the theory doesnt translate into practice as the director of Napoleon Dynamite and the writer of School of Rock together provide a masterclass in how not to be funny. Indecision seems to have been the killer. Co-produced by the childrens TV network Nickleodeon its sort of a kids movie clearly straining to be a little bit naughtier. The love interest (Ana de la Regueras Sister Encarnacion) hovers between pious and desirable the comedy sidekick (Hector Jimenezs skeletal Esquelto) is neither wise nor funny. Gags come and go without much set-up or follow-through. Its all flat as a tortilla. Lingering pointlessly over the Kahlo-esque backgrounds and gargoyle-faced extras Hesss static handling proves pathologically unsuited to Blacks enthusiastic physicality draining the life from the ringside action and reining in the star performer. Of course seeing him in his clinging sky blue and burgundy get-up raises a smile but it cant carry an entire movie. Confoundingly underwhelming.

This family-friendly PG-rated pic looks primed to pin a leggy theatrical run. Although its marketing campaign stresses Jack Black in tights ""Nacho Libre"" strikes a delicate balance of whimsy and absurdity that may surprise auds primed to expect wall-to-wall slapstick. Helmer Jared Hess followup to ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a more traditionally commercial comedy that nonetheless percolates with the same quirky off-centeredness that infused his 2004 cult fave. Even auds immune to the earlier pics eccentric charms may enjoy the deftly muted zaniness of this fable about a would-be Mexican grapplers misadventures. This family-friendly PG-rated pic looks primed to pin a leggy theatrical run. Black often appears aglow with a pixilated sweetness in his appealingly loopy star turn as Ignacio an orphan raised by friars in a Mexican monastery. (Pic neatly finesses the potentially troublesome issue of the thesps unmistakable gringo-ness by explaining the characters mom was a Scandinavian missionary.) Ignacio labors devoutly as the monasterys cook making the most of meager means -- very very meager means -- while preparing a steady menu of bland gray gruel for the friars and the orphans in their care. Relentlessly driven to provide a more varied bill of fare -- and boyishly eager to impress lovely young Sister Encarnacion (telenovella vet Ana de le Reguera) a new addition to the monastery staff -- Ignacio wants to join the ranks of Lucha Libre wrestlers those larger-than-life kings of the ring who are idolized throughout Mexico. The friars forbid such worldly activities but Ignacio plans to wrestle under the pseudonym Nacho and to wear a concealing mask -- just like his idol Ramses (real-life luchador Cesar Gonzalez) the reigning champion. Even after he finds a tag-team partner in Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) an impossibly skinny street fighter with bad teeth and worse social skills Ignacio fares poorly as a macho luchador. Although he earns a tidy sum even when he loses to ferocious midgets or golden-ager grapplers he wants to prove he has what it takes to rank with the greats. And failing that -- well hed like to beat somebody anybody at least once. ""Nacho Libre"" lopes along a fairly predictable course heading toward a climactic match in which Nacho butts heads with the haughty Ramses. Working from a script he concocted with wife Jerusha Hess (who also collaborated on ""Napoleon Dynamite"") and Mike White (co-writer with Jack Black of ""The School of Rock"") Hess treats his familiar plot merely as an excuse to string together scenes of straight-faced looniness and mock-serious dialogue. Whenever Ignacio rouses himself to speechify dramatically or sing soulfully auds can safely expect some sort of punchline.Blacks ability to temper wild-eyed excess with heartfelt sincerity (or some reasonable facsimile thereof) keeps Ignacio endearing throughout. ""Chaplinesque"" is a word that gets tossed about much too freely (and inaccurately) by critics but its easy to spot the similarities between Ignacios earnest efforts in the square circle and Charlie Chaplins desperate measures during the classic boxing match in ""City Lights."" With the considerable help of stunt coordinator Nick Powell (""Braveheart"" ""Gladiator"") Black plows through the wrestling scenes with a robust flair that is at once graceful and hilarious. Filmed entirely on location in Mexico ""Nacho Libre"" showcases many local talents on either side of the cameras. Effectively low-key supporting perfs by Jimenez and de la Reguera are perfectly suited for pic in which nothing not even a camel clutch or a body slam ever is allowed to get too far out of hand. Standout tech contributors include lenser Xavier Perez Grobet (""Before Night Falls"") and costumer Graciela Mazon (""Once Upon a Time in Mexico""). Pic overall is affectionately respectful in its treatment of Lucha Libre -- aud is invited to laugh but not at the wrestlers and their enthusiastic fans -- which should please those who viewed ""Napoleon Dynamite"" as somehow condescending to its nerdy characters. Of course the presence of Caesar Gonzalez and other real-life luchadores in the cast may partially account for absence of jeering mockery. After all would you want to get those guys angry?

Bring kids. Anybodys kids. Youll have a better time. I brought three rowdy preteen Jack Black fans to ""Nacho Libre."" Good thing. They were delighted by every pratfall; each instance of Black mugging for the camera; and lots of extraneous scatological stuff. Without their exuberance I could have easily sunk into abject despair. ""Nacho Libre"" which opens at midnight tonight at several theaters is one of those movies that makes you wonder what happened to a sure thing. Its the second feature by Jared Hess -- whose ""Napoleon Dynamite"" was one of the best films of 2004 -- and looked in trailers to be even more culturally loopy than the vacuum of ""Napoleons"" Preston Idaho. It is loopier. But its also more superficial one big joke referencing the strange phenomenon of Mexicos masked-wrestler movies and the dampening effect of too much piety on the human spirit. Where there was nothing satirical about Napoleon -- the geeky hero was genuinely suffering from being self-referential in a larger world he couldnt understand -- Blacks Nacho a cook in an Oaxacan monastery-orphanage is a caricature of religious docility at war with machismo. His testosterone surging with the arrival at the priory of a beautiful nun (Ana de la Reguera) Nacho becomes a masked wrestler with a secret identity. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Nacho Libre"" with Jack Black Ana de la Reguera Hector Jimenez. Directed by Jared Hess written from a screenplay by Hess Jerusha Hess and Mike White. 91 minutes. Rated PG for rough action and crude humor. Several theaters. Along with tag-team partner Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) the ample champ gets slaughtered every week fighting feral dwarves and sundry brutes. For the most part the film is a succession of sight gags and Blacks impressive gallery of funny expressions for looking stirred by calls to greatness. Some things work well but many are strained in execution. There are times ""Nacho Libre"" looks like its struggling to find a reason to continue. So what happened? One thing that looked so promising was a script co-written by Mike White who delivered a terrific hit for Black in ""School of Rock."" It now appears his sensibility and Hess didnt mesh so well. One can still see Hess touch especially in the listening-to-angels expression on so many faces (think Pedro in ""Napoleon""). But in the end this Nickelodeon co-production is really an impersonal film for children who will see Black in anything.

But Jack Black alone cant wrangle Nacho Libre. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Nacho Libre Comedy. Starring Jack Black Ana de la Reguera and Hector Jimenez. Directed by Jared Hess. (PG. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If a dissertation is ever written about Jack Black a whole chapter should be devoted to ""Nacho Libre"" not because its particularly good but because its odd. The movie has the realistic locations the small-world specificity and the plot details of a poignant drama. At times it even seems to be trying to go for a dramatic effect. Yet everything in the direction is consistently broad rendering absurd all that the movie simultaneously tries to build. In this schizophrenic production director Jared Hess (""Napoleon Dynamite"") knows just one thing that Jack Black is funny. The audience knows that too. Black plays Nacho a cook in a Mexican monastery and at one point he makes a speech about how wonderful his life is sleeping alone every night and getting up at 5 in the morning to make soup for orphan children. Hes trying to make it sound good but the tight smile on his face and the screwy look in his eyes reveal a frustration bordering on madness. Black does that well the man who tries to contain himself but cant. Black is also funny singing. He has funny expressions. Hes funny when looking at a beautiful nun (Ana de la Reguera) and he does a funny Mexican accent one thats almost real but isnt quite. Here and there ""Nacho Libre"" plays like a satire of a rags-to-riches drama and Black matches that by speaking his lines as though he were in the most earnest drama ever made pushing it to the ridiculous. Yet for all that the comedy is hit and miss with good bits interrupted by dead patches. Its a movie to root for more than to enjoy. Hess reliance on Black results in a bland but eccentric approach to filming ""Nacho Libre."" If you see the movie note how infrequently Hess puts Black in a two-shot. That is if he wants to show him in conversation Hess rarely has Black share the same frame with another actor. Instead he films him from the waist up facing the camera almost looking directly into it. This approach works so long as the camera is on Black. Hes fun and volatile and he usually does something interesting. But the approach comes with one problem It means that half of every scene doesnt have Black on screen. It has whatever actor he happens to be talking to and this constant cutting to the other actors who have very little going on creates a stilted start-and-stop quality. This style may have been intended as a parody of a familiar dramatic style. In fact everything about ""Nacho Libre"" sounds like a recipe for drama except Black. Its tells the story of a man orphaned as a boy who grew up in a monastery and is scorned by the monks for his bad cooking. Secretly in love with the lovely Sister Encarnarcion (de la Reguera) he wishes shed renounce her vows and marry him. Then one day he sees a pro wrestler surrounded by glamour and adulation and wrestling becomes his symbol for everything his life lacks. And so he begins his wrestling career getting beat up every night and still carrying a torch for the sister. Curiously these wrestling scenes are not especially funny just lighthearted and that only occasionally. The world of wrestling is taken seriously as is the world of the monastery. In fact it would be difficult not to take either seriously given the realism with which theyre presented. ""Nacho Libre"" was filmed entirely in Oaxaca and the old missions the bleached rock and the real Mexicans in the wrestling arenas ground the movie in a world too tangible for comic casualness. Black stumbles into this world with all his comic gifts and wrestles it to a draw. -- Advisory Some mild crudeness.

"Nacho Libre | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; nacho-libre ) Nacho Libre (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli When a movie tries to be intentionally campy it follows a difficult road. Most films that attempt this fail because the artifice of the situation drains the humor from it. Genuine camp is the child of earnestness and ineptitude and is only found in features that the director intends to be taken seriously. Thats not to say it cant be manufactured as a means of parody but such an act requires a deftness of touch that at least in this case escapes director Jared Hess. After a promising beginning Nacho Libre goes off the rails with its over-the-top satire and intentional campiness failing to generate many laughs. The film starts out funny but it doesnt take long for it to become tedious. Its possible to see some similarities between Nacho Libre and Hess Napoleon Dynamite. Both films are about outsiders and both main characters have bizarre best friends. However the main character in Napoleon Dynamite was an unpleasant individual. In Nacho Libre hes a lovable loser. Were supposed to identify with him or at least like him although Jack Blacks unrepressed performance often makes Nacho more irritating than endearing. But its clear from the script that were supposed to root for Nacho. That means that the single unique defining characteristic of Napoleon Dynamite - the main characters off-putting personality - is absent here. That changes the nature of the humor from biting wit to the aforementioned intentional camp. One other note I can deal with the idea of a nun as a sex object although none of the nuns I knew as a child looked anything like Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) but its odd for this to occur in a PG movie. The movie tiptoes around a relationship which makes the romance tepid and unsatisfying. Nacho and Sister Encarnacion have taken vows of celibacy but he goes out of his way on more than one occasion to intimate he might be willing to break his. We never find out whether she feels the same way. Nacho Libre is conflicted about how to deal with this pair and as a result never resolves their feelings for one another. Nacho is a friar at a Mexican orphanage. He has lived there since he was a boy and has grown up to be the cook. He has a secret love - wrestling - but he cant admit to it because the monks think its the work of the devil. Even the newly arrived nun pretty Sister Encarnacion agrees that wrestling is bad for the soul. This disheartens Nacho since he likes her but it doesnt stop him from starting a career in the ring behind a mask. Along with his tag-team partner the skeletally skinny Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) he engages in a number of amateur bouts. Nacho despite never winning becomes a popular figure and he eventually earns a chance to take on the king of wrestling Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez) in an exhibition match. If youre a fan of Jack Blacks overacting antics you may find what Nacho Libre has to offer to be palatable. For me the film dragged. Its only 90 minutes long but it seemed longer. I laughed a few times usually at physical gags (such as what happens when Nacho makes the mistake of challenging a bull) but too little of the films humor worked its magic. Neither the romance nor the friendship between Nacho and Esqueleto has an effective emotional payoff and attempts to humanize the Nacho caricature make parts of the film feel awkward. Too much in Nacho Libre doesnt work to enable me to recommend it to anyone except a card-carrying member of the Jack Black fan club.

How does one greet such a spectacle? Is this strange doughy man with demonic eyebrows the funniest dude alive or a megasize baby with an overpaid sneer? How you respond to that will determine how you respond to this an odd cinematic hiccup called Nacho Libre. I kind of like Jack Black love him in the right vehicle -- High Fidelity or School of Rock two films that capitalized on his singularly deranged energy. I had hoped Nacho Libre would be one such vehicle but it isnt. In fact it isnt much of anything; Im not even sure it classifies as a movie. Yep theres Jack Black in tights -- and untamed curls and a mustache. Why does he wear them? Because hes Ignacio aka Nacho a downtrodden monk with dreams of makin it big in the world of lucha libre aka Mexican freestyle wrestling. Ignacio loves the orphans who live in the monastery but he resents having to cook gruel for them every day and longs to provide a salad now and then. He similarly longs for Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) whose berobed foxiness stirs feelings hitherto bound by celibacy. In one of the movies three sort-of-amusing moments he belts out a horrific pop ballad climaxing in a strangled plea to break their vows. (The other two moments involve Blacks pinched butt cheeks and some eye-gouging business with a piece of corn.) Ignacio figures if he can win big as a luchador then maybe hell puff up his manhood for ""Seester"" and feed veggies to the orphans simultaneously. Sounds like a plan. Blacks partner in crime through all of this is Hector Jimenez as a scrawny tortilla thief who hooks up with Nacho as tag-team luchadores. Quite a few scenes involve these two pantied warriors (or whatnot) being tossed around by oily goliaths and horned gnomes (or whatnot). Many other scenes involve Blacks above-mentioned brow which snaps up and down while his eyes pop wide and his mouth contorts around a purposely mangled accent. Mexicans -- or anyone else come to think of it -- might well be offended by the movies ethnic mugging. Fans of lucha libre might also have a grievance since the film reduces their wildly gymnastic heroes to a bunch of masked goons. Nacho Libre was directed by supposed lucha fan Jared Hess and co-written with his wife Jerusha (theyre the minds behind the weirdness that was Napoleon Dynamite) along with School of Rock scribe Mike White. Black and White are buds and business partners so Im sure they had a cool time thinking up wedgie jokes. But wedgies can take a film only so far. A spongy guy in a clingy suit who has a spongy hairdo is funny to a point and kudos to Black for the self-deprecation. Kudos as well for his athleticism and balletic grace as he leaps around the ring. Unfortunately they cant support a movie. No tights could. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals 4-Panel Abstract Wall Art by Jon Allen for 145 + free shipping Defiant LED Flashlight 3-Pack for 10 + pickup at Home Depot Tamrac 28"" ZipShot Mini Compact Camera Tripod for 10 + free...

Jack Black is no ""Rocky."" Sure ""Nacho Libre"" has Black climbing into the ring as an underdog looking to his true love for inspiration and grappling a bigger man. But the comedians humanity spills over his spandex like 3 pounds of chips in a 2-pound bag. So lets call him ""Husky."" ""Nacho Libre"" is as Husky does. The movie dips only as far into the hot cheese as Black can take it without benefit of a script. Turns out thats not very deep. High concept still fails without writers filling in the blank spots and ""Jack Black in wrestling tights"" is funny for about as long as the trailer youve already seen. Writer-director Jared Hess is the name that gave us such high hopes for a comedy smackdown yet here the sensibility behind ""Napoleon Dynamite"" turns out to be more problem than solution. Hess revels in tight lingering close-ups of odd faces with long pauses meant as a nudge-nudge to the audience that we should appreciate the strange when its set before us. ""Napoleon"" paid off by taking us to a painfully normal Idaho town so close to our own world that it paradoxically seemed like a different universe. But Hesss Mexican hill town for ""Nacho Libre"" is too distant for us to know exactly when to laugh. With his silly Mexican accent - Ricardo Montalban meets Monty Python - is Jack Black making fun of himself or something bigger? How many poo jokes is this talented writing team allowed before we go from PG to Pre-Juvenile? And is it ever OK for a novice priest to be hot for Sister? Methinks the Vatican ought to leave poor Leonardo da Vinci alone and start keeping an eye on comedies. For all Nachos bulging flesh the story is as skinny as Nachos bony partner Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez). Nacho grows up in a Catholic orphanage dreaming of becoming a famed masked wrestler on Mexicos campy ""Lucha Libre"" circuit. The monks forbid wrestling as worshipping false idols a point perhaps undercut by the graveyard saints on whom Nacho practices his moves. Later training to become a priest Nacho is the orphanage cook whose budget allows him to produce only a positively satanic version of refried beans. Nacho must don a mask and fight to win money for fresh vegetables Oh and Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) will get to see him in form-fitting pants. The writers apparently couldnt shake from their minds the so-very-wrong image of Black in a cape shirtless underneath. If any team could pull it off this one could Hess co-writing with his wife and ""Napoleon"" partner Jerusha Hess and Mike White who put such smart-stupid humor into ""School of Rock"" and ""Orange County."" Alas Nacho is not so Libre that he can soar to comic heights - at least not with this sleeper-hold of a script. When the pauses between jokes seem overly long the team seems happy to let Black riff in now-familiar ways. He sings a rock-opera song about Sister Encarnacion - dont look for the full version on Univision anytime soon - that appears at once ad-libbed and cribbed from his show-stopping prance in ""School of Rock."" Black is one of those rare comedians whos funny just to look at but even the best jokesters need new material now and then. Nacho Dynamite Napoleon Libre you never quite fly off those turnbuckles.

Movie review Silly gives way to outlandish in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" July 29 2016 Ricky Baker is an orphaned juvenile delinquent a ""real bad egg"" as an onscreen title announces in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" Taika Waititis endearingly playful adventure tale set in the New Zealand bush. In Jason Bourne a familiar if darker tale in a post-Edward Snowden world July 29 2016 Aside from updating to todays surveillance state ""Jason Bourne"" largely sticks to the franchises familiar moves and they often dont have the same kinetic finesse they used to.

First there was ""The Da Vinci Code"" then ""The Omen"" and now we have ""Nacho Libre"" starring Jack Black as a cook in a Mexican monastery.Nachos mother was a Scandinavian missionary and his dad was a Mexican deacon. As he is fond of saying ""They tried to convert each other but got married instead."" The mixed parentage also forestalls the thorny P.C. problem of having an Anglo actor playing a Mexican although I dont recall any such gambit when George Hamilton played Zorro.Orphaned as a boy Nacho has remained in the monastery and feeds its orphans under the watchful glare of the monks. His meals are atrocious - gloppy refried beans and crumbly tortilla chips. But the boys regard him as a kind of mascot and the arrival of an attractive nun Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera) encourages him. And so in order to earn money to pay for better meals at the monastery he assumes a double life and becomes a Lucha Libre wrestler - something that is forbidden by the church elders. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The sight of Black in stretch pants and cape as he takes on a succession of grapplers is by definition hilarious. As with all Lucha wrestlers he wears a mask in the ring but even covered up his facial contortions come through loud and clear. Black has the most expressive eyebrows since Jack Nicholson. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The movie which was co-written and directed by Jared Hess (""Napoleon Dynamite"") might have been funnier if it had concentrated on the wrestling matches. Angelic nuns and grinning urchins dont do much for comedy. By making Nacho a do-gooder Hess defuses Blacks subversive energy. You could argue that Black also played a do-gooder in ""School of Rock"" but the kids in that film were a lot spunkier and Black wasnt constantly playing for sympathy as he does here.Its always a problem when great comics decide - as almost all of them eventually do - to pour on the hearts and flowers. Everybody from Charlie Chaplin to Jim Carrey has succumbed. In ""Nacho Libre"" Black is wrestling not only with his opponents but with himself. Hes going against his own grain.That said watching Black even in a mediocre movie has its upside. Hes one of those comic actors - Will Ferrell is another - who just seems innately funny to me. He doesnt have to do much of anything to make me laugh.Black is more than just a talented goofball though. His performance in ""School of Rock"" had everything - humor pathos gymnastics - a great piece of acting that wasnt recognized as such. Critics and Academy Awards voters persist in devaluing comic performances as if anything that makes us laugh cannot possibly be art. This attitude is responsible for why so many comic actors get all serious on us They want to be recognized as artists and win awards.That surely wont happen here. ""Nacho Libre"" is a throwaway movie but that doesnt mean it could not have been better. The wrestling scenes for example which should be a comic highlight are poorly staged. Nacho is given a funny tag-team partner - the gangly toothy Esqueleto the Skeleton (Hector Jimenez) - who unfortunately seems to disappear halfway through the movie.Mr. Hess appears to believe that to make a comedy all you have to do is put oddball people on the screen. This actually worked for him in ""Napoleon Dynamite"" but too often in ""Nacho Libre"" the actors just stand there looking dopey as if they were waiting for their cue. The wait is too long. Grade C Rated PG for some rough action and crude humor including dialogue.

"No Holds Barred washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On No Holds Barred Actor Black stars as Nacho a cook at a Mexican orphanage who moonlights as a Lucha Libre wrestler to raise money for the orphans in a scene from the new comedy film Nacho Libre in this undated publicity photograph. The film opens in the U.S. June 16 2006. NO SALES NO ARCHIVES REUTERS/Paramount Pictures/Handout (Paramount Pictures Via Reuters) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 16 2006 ""Nacho Libre"" the new film from Jared Hess who directed ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is er singular. The ""er"" in the previous sentence reveals that I dont know what the hell else to call it. Funny? Now and then. Stupid? Very. Racist? Possibly. Ugly? Profoundly. Wild? Undeniably. Singular? Completely. The movie is a sendup of or takeoff on a Mexican athletic/entertainment tradition called Lucha Libre a kind of over-the-top professional wrestling circuit that encourages its participants called luchadores to wear masks. These large gentlemen in brightly colored flame-embroidered head-encasing satin envelopes (they will remind you of the Phantom or Batman) fly about the ring pounding the snot out of each other for the edification of the masses thereby earning great sums of money. Are they more flamboyant than our own pro wrestlers that mad tribe of blob-muscled vein-popping steroid-sucking personalities who do the same here? Well the masks do give the enterprise an odd vibration of perversity (they look like porn stars of the 50s) but otherwise it seems quite similar. The key question is tone Is Hess appreciating Lucha Libre from the bottom up that is loving its excesses its satin vulgarities its outlandishness along with the audience because they are so much fun? Or is he working from the top down snickering at the business because it represents the folk imagination of a benighted uneducated rural proletariat who know no better? The movie itself offers no concession to those who would seek an answer. And you could of course take the Mexicans out of the equation and make the same kind of movie about other disreputable forms of amusement that the masses seem to like while people of refinement snicker disapprovingly such as soap operas deer hunting NASCAR chitlin circuit comedy and Larry the Cable Guy. But Hess does seem to find Mexicans uniquely funny; after all it was Pedro the clueless Mexican who was a source of much laughter in ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and the clueless Mexican as an archetype seems to be the source of much of the humor in ""Nacho Libre"" the blank and uncomprehending mug of a Mexican staring but not reacting at something sometimes cockeyed always with mouth open dumbfounded. The plot features one American Jack Black hiding behind a large bad Mexican accent and a perm from hell and a lot of Mexicans -- almost to a man clueless. Black plays Ignacio nicknamed Nacho a monk in an orphanage whose job consists of fixing the beans for the kids. Beans? Bean jokes? You can see where that is going but before it gets there the movie extracts much humor out of the comic possibilities of the bean in an unguent brownish gel with a few fractured Doritos floating on the liquefied but dense surface the whole mulchy squalid thing confined in a shallow ceramic bowl. He loves to show Nacho dropping a dish congealed with such mucilage in front of the disappointed children with a kind of sloppy plop. Okay beans are funny -- if youre 12. The plot also ascribes powerful sexual feelings as well as political machinations to a Mexican religious order. Again given the ugliness of human nature this is probably true and at least Nachos feelings for the lovely Sister Encarnacion (beautiful Ana de la Reguera) remain unconsummated even if she agrees to go to his room for . . . toast. Is toast funny? I guess so. But the wrestling is the real center of the movie. Nacho joining with a tag-team partner played by a fellow who seems to have about 300 teeth named Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez)  secretly signs up for a match in order to raise money to buy lettuce for salads to relieve the monotony of the beans and perhaps give us sanctuary from all the magical-fruit bean jokes. The movie then follows the secret career of Nacho Libre the wrestler juxtaposing it with the banality of the monk Ignacio who is the butt of all that witty monastery repartee even as he tries to move in on Sister Encarnacion. Oh and also for real yuks for his transportation needs he drives a power lawnmower. Black is a curious figure. His appeal is that given one of the ugliest bodies in America he has no shame in showing it and no repression in moving it. So much of ""Nacho Libre"" is indeed about free Nacho liberated from the confines of the monks cowl throwing himself around the ring with total abandon. This is funny Black is as graceless as a Volkswagen with a wheel that has fallen off but hes also brazen. He just gives it up for the film and the film subversively encourages us to laugh at the nerdy arrhythmic fat-butted waddle-intensive lurch of his moves. (This is a trick Hess learned in ""Napoleon Dynamite"" where the ungainly Jon Heder suddenly comically broke into dance and was incredibly . . . ungainly.) Again you have no trouble guessing where the movies primitive excuse for a plot is going Nacho will lose and lose (yet always getting a payoff so that he can give the kids their lettuce) until at last he is matched against the cartoon villain a champion luchadore in a pink mask called Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez an actual luchadore). Again however some choices Hess makes are extremely unusual. For example he has encouraged the cinematographer Xavier Perez Grobet to use the most garish palette so the movie always looks overexposed and tawdry. Its reds and greens knock your eyes out. This plays up the squalor of rural Mexico the scabby unkemptness the peeling old paint and rotting old wood that seems everywhere. The movie seems to have a doomed gringo drunks view of Mexico with all the grotesqueness exaggerated with all the ugliness accentuated with all the sordidness underscored. Its like ""Under the Volcano"" for children Nacho Libre (90 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for comic violence.

"Black pulls off a comic smackdown - USATODAY.com SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Movies Cars  Event tickets   Jobs Real estate  Shop   Online degrees Black pulls off a comic smackdown Updated 6/16/2006 124 AM ET E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY A friar in Mexico who spends his days cooking for orphans and his nights wrestling hulks in masks is a quirky premise for a movie. But by harnessing his physical energy and toning down his in-your-face style Jack Black makes it work in Nacho Libre (   out of four). What is missing in plot and character development is made up for in silly fun. The highlights of this uneven comedy are Black whose Spanish accent is top-notch and his elastic-faced rail-thin sidekick played by Hector Jimenez as well as the catchy score by Danny Elfman and Beck. Directed by Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite) the film has a meandering pace. Yes it has the obligatory bathroom jokes but it also has offbeat humor. Nacho (Black) has lived in a Mexican orphanage since he was a child. Now a monk in training he works as a cook at the orphanage. Several laughs come from his culinary concoctions which usually involve stale chips. When the children complain about his meals begging for simple salads he realizes he must earn money for fresh ingredients to feed his young charges. When a ""lucha libre"" Mexican-style wrestler comes to town amid much fanfare Nacho decides to moonlight and teams up with Jimenez whom he dubs Esqueleto (the Skeleton). Nacho is drawn to a beautiful young nun (Ana de la Reguera) who tells him wrestling is a sin because its all about ""false idols."" But Nacho and Esqueleto must keep wrestling and losing to earn money. The story is paper-thin but the laughs are there. Its all about Black and Jimenezs facial expressions and some well-timed one-liners. Mike White who wrote School of Rock and the more eccentric indie Chuck and Buck is a co-writer with Hess and his wife Jerusha. Its comical just to hear Black deliver lines such as ""I am the gatekeeper of my own destiny and I will have my glory days"" in a Ricardo Montalban-inspired accent. Black is considerably skilled in physical comedy and his sometimes-overbearing mannerisms are wisely downplayed. Sure it gets old to see him leap about in tights boots cape and unflattering red shorts but Nacho explains his monks robe was ""estinky."" The humor is unabashedly juvenile but not mean-spirited. And Black and Jimenez have a Laurel-and-Hardy anti-hero quality that works comedically. Not only is the story oddly endearing but the setting is distinctive and picturesque. This is not the WWE Mexican-style but it has to be the only American-made wrestling comedy set in the culturally rich state of Oaxaca. (Running time 1 hour 31 minutes. Rating PG for some rough action and crude humor. Opens in some theaters Thursday.)

"Nacho Libre reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Nacho Libre reviewed. Nacho Libre reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 15 2006 545 PM Down for the Count Jack Black submits to Nacho Libre. By Dana Stevens Jack Black at the Nacho Libre premiere Sophomore efforts dont get much more sophomoric than Nacho Libre (Paramount) the Mexican wrestling buddy comedy from 26-year-old indie director Jared Hess. Hess first feature Napoleon Dynamite was a deadpan geek comedy that charmed the pants off Sundance in 2004 and went on to become a minor cult sensation. Personally I never got Napoleon Dynamite. Hess tribute to anomic misfits in an Idaho high school seemed like a Wes Anderson movie without the elegant wit or a Todd Solondz movie without the grim humor. But at least I saw what you were supposed to like about it. If Napoleon Dynamite coasted too far on stock gags and borrowed tropes (including a title and main character shamelessly lifted from Elvis Costello) Nacho Libre tries to squeeze more mileage out of even less material and sputters to an ignominious halt in the first 20 minutes. At least three-quarters of Nacho Libres jokes rest on the assumption that being Mexican is inherently hilarious. Jack Black plays Brother ""Nacho"" Ignacio a monk who works as a cook in an Oaxacan orphanage as a Latino numskull with an accent somewhere between Ricky Ricardo and Ren of Ren amp; Stimpy. Ignacio speaks mysteriously in Americanized slang (""So anyways lets get down to the neety-greety"") and follows up grandiose pronouncements with a self-deprecating ""whatever."" But he dreams big dreams doodling drawings of himself as a lucha libre wrestler and lusting chastely after the angelically hot Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera). In a back-alley scuffle over a discarded bag of tortilla chips Ignacio meets up with Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) a tall scrawny beggar who manages to wrestle the chunky monk into submission. Soon the two are making money as a Laurel-and-Hardy wrestling tag team getting their asses handed to them by masked behemoths named things like ""Ramses"" and ""El Snowflake."" But what if Esqueleto and Nacho got serious about the sport and started to do some ass-handing of their own? Advertisement This setup is of course transcendently stupid but thats not Nacho Libres problem. Dodgeball (2004) proved that dumb sports movies about flabby clueless losers could be pretty charming. But Dodgeball had a real affection for its flabby clueless losers. As he did in Napoleon Dynamite Hess spends the majority of this film reminding us that its main characters dreams and aspirations are worthy of amused contempt then expects us to cheer at the end when those dreams are realized. Or are we cheering ironically? The films odd last shot in which Nacho responds to his true loves thumbs-up with a stiff fake-looking smile leaves the audience in a state of awkward suspension unsure if this is a real happy ending or a happy ending that makes fun of happy endings. Either way the emotional payoff feels unearned. Ill risk being branded a humorless prig by calling attention to the implicit racism of Nacho Libre. Visually the film pays homage to its setting The wrestling costumes are glorious and the flat compositions and dusty pastels recall Mexican religious iconography. But the music choices feel insultingly generic a pan-Latin blend of Brazilian pop standards and internationalist kitsch like Esquivels ""Mucha Muchacha."" The story and dialogue appeal to a xenophobic slacker complacency that regards other cultures as little more than a source of campy knickknacks. As for the plentiful sight gags they rarely rise above the level of ha-ha-he-fell-down and occasionally sink below it During the inevitable training montage Nacho for no apparent reason hurls a cow patty at the head of his wrestling buddy Esqueleto. Yeah throwing shit in your partners face--that would be funny. Er ... heh. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Jack Black is a force of nature a spectacularly antic performer who falls outside categories like actor singer or comedian. His sheer physical exuberance reminds me of Judy Miller the preteen Girl Scout character Gilda Radner used to play on Saturday Night Live who bounced on her bed belting disco tunes into a hairbrush. Black has inspired moments even in Nacho Libre particularly when his character bursts into spontaneous song. But at this point in his career fresh from his flat role in King Kong Black risks falling into the dreaded Robin Williams Vortex--the career trajectory of the comic whose manic energy is diverted into increasingly unfunny projects until finally he becomes unfunny himself. Black has the potential to be the rare comedian capable of making lemons into lemonade but the fruit hes squeezing here is bone-dry. Nacho Libres writers--Jared Hess his wife Jerusha and the usually funny Mike White--treat every non sequiturasif it were a surefire cult catchphrase. And maybe given Napoleon Dynamites breakout success and the pockets of isolated but hysterical laughter I heard in the screening room some of this wan dialogue actually will pass into common parlance.

You get revved to see a big Hollywood comedy starring an actor so funny he could make you laugh in your sleep and youre disappointed. Majorly. You can see what the film was going for but the jokes just sit there; you chuckle a few times mostly out of lame hope but you never bust a gut never really get what you came for. Its the movie-comedy equivalent of a middling date. Then a few months later or maybe even a few years you run across the same movie on late-night cable and to your surprise and slow-dawning delight you find yourself watching. Compulsively. The lead character may still not be that uproarious only now with your expectations dialed down to zero you cant help but notice that theres a certain ineffably amusing...essence about him. Scenes that once fell flat now exert their own fruitcake logic; they may be dumb but their dumbness now comes off as exquisitely conscious. Youre hooked. You can watch that same movie again and again and you do. In recent years Ive had this experience with The Cable Guy Tommy Boy and Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy -- all of which I had panned without much mercy in this magazine. (Sorry Jim David Chris and Will.) So maybe at some point in the future Ill be lucky enough to have it with Nacho Libre a kitschy faux-Mexican idiot-slob wrestling comedy starring Jack Black and his noble blubbery bod. Its a movie that seems to be trying hard for that cheesy-innocent so-stupid-its-smart vibe and it represents the collaboration of some very gifted people Jared Hess director of the flip yet indelible youthquake Napoleon Dynamite and the brilliantly funny and original screenwriter Mike White who wrote School of Rock and Chuck amp; Buck two of my favorite films of the past 10 years. Black plays what sounds like a charmingly naughty underdog a wide-eyed monk in a cassock named Ignacio who is haunted by his forbidden thoughts like his desire to make time with the sexy new nun (Ana de la Reguera) but mostly by his dream of escaping his life of pious drudgery to become a Lucha Libre wrestler a sinfully invincible masked superfighter. Yet if you go to this movie here is what you will see Jack Black in a curly mop of hair and a mustache thats like the mirror image of his twitchy turned-up eyebrows looking like Avery Schreiber in the old Doritos commercials as he speaks in a chintzy Mexican accent and drops the occasional ha-ha American anachronism like ""Whatever"" or ""It sucks to be me"" Ignacio breaking wind riding around the hills in his imbecilic scooter-with-a-giant-basket or clenching his mighty butt cheeks together. Ignacio who works as a cook in his remote desert monastery serving orphans meals that resemble mole sauce mixed with merde. Ignacio donning a red cape and shorts baby blue tights and a head-hugging demonic mask to become Nacho his secret wrestling alter ego which becomes the occasion for Black to leap around the ring in fits of camp vanity as he flaunts his spectacularly terrible body -- not just the thrusting big ball of a belly but the flat chest and arms the nascent hint of man-breasts the whole pathetic muscle-free package. Are you laughing yet? Youd better be because thats about all there is to Nacho Libre. Its a comedy made by people who seem to think theyre doing more than theyre doing which is making a mildly offbeat Adam Sandler comedy with an innocuous racist tinge of Mexicans-are-good-for-a-cheap-laugh sarcasm. The film was shot south of the border with a mostly local crew and you can almost taste the ticky-tackiness and squalor but to what end? This is the sort of movie in which Nachos tag-team partner -- yes its a buddy comedy -- is a bag of bones named Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez) whose main activities are showing off his grunge teeth and at one point hooking up with an obese lady who boasts an even more crooked-toothed smile. Black you can tell keeps wishing that he could just let loose and become Jack Black -- which he does on a couple of occasions when hes singing at which point youre relieved but also depressed since its clear that the whole Ignacio/Nacho character is too thin a conceit to entertain even the actor playing him. The wrestling scenes have little farcical zest since real wrestling is already too stylized to stylize. As filmmakers Jared Hess and Mike White must have wanted to make Nacho a beautiful loser who triumphs but they neglected to give him that glimmer of soul -- the one that might have shined a bit brighter down the road on late-night cable where Nacho Libre I fear will look pretty much as mirthless as it does now.
