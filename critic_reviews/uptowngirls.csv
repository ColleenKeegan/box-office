"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

BAILEY Uptown Girls more annoying than cute / Murphy seems stuck in her Clueless role 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Uptown Girls Comedy/drama. Starring Brittany Murphy Dakota Fanning and Heather Locklear. Directed by Boaz Yakin. Written by Julie Dahl and Mo Ogrodnik. (PG-13. 93 minutes. At the Metreon AMC 1000 and Kabuki.) Brittany Murphy flounces flops and mugs in ""Uptown Girls"" attempting to convince us that she is adorable and that we are having an uproarious time. But actually . . . not so much. Murphy earned her rep in a supporting role as the socially challenged new girl in school in ""Clueless."" Here she plays Molly the daughter of legendary rock n roller Tommy Gunn who died with her mother in a plane crash. That left Molly fabulously rich spoiled and blissfully unaware of the needs of anyone in the world except herself. Clueless in other words. What is almost impossible not to notice is that from the flyaway hair to the poufy skirts and tight little tops Molly looks almost exactly like Carrie Sarah Jessica Parkers character in HBOs ""Sex and the City."" Shes one of those kooky types and in case you dont get it she has a pet pig. Molly lives in decadent luxury in a fabulous if faded New York apartment clubbing hooking up and sleeping in (and around). She clearly needs a wake-up call and gets it when it is discovered that the family business manager has absconded with all her money. Molly has to get a job and it will not take a plot detective to guess that it will involve Ray (Dakota Fanning from ""I Am Sam"") a snit-fit prone germ- obsessed 8-year-old girl who is introduced early in the action. Oh boy when these two get together sparks are gonna fly. Except that they really dont. Neither of the two is nearly as cute as the filmmakers think they are. Frankly Molly is legitimately annoying. She uses her friends like servants and doesnt get it when they are miffed. She finds a great guy Neal (Australian newcomer Jesse Spencer) but tires of him immediately -- then decides she wants him back when he drops her. Granted the idea is to set up Molly as oblivious and spoiled but shes more. Shes a jerk. Ray is also supposed to be presented as a tough case emotionally distant because of an absent mother and a father in a coma. (A coma? Can we get any more manipulative?) We know that Rays flinty exterior conceals a little girl in pain. But theres an awful lot of flint. For at least half the movie she screams insults at Molly -- ""You are pathetic Are you on crack?"" -- or flips her off (twice) until you wonder why she is worth the bother. Mostly Ray is just another in a series of pale creepy ""Sixth Sense"" kids in movies wise beyond her years but in need of help. Her part as everyone can see will consist of her opening up and beginning to trust and feel again. That means the movie stands or falls on what you think of Murphys character. Is she an adorable screwball or just a spoiled flake? Shes walking around New York with a pig on a leash. Youve got to have an opinion about that. Theres more than a hint of desperation to Murphys characterization. (After all ""Clueless"" was eight years ago.) She dances free-form in Central Park falls off her outlandish high heels and gets into a knock-down drag-out fight with one of the nannies. (Actually that was kind of funny.) Murphy has skills but it is time to admit shes not a kid anymore. Wearing heavy black eyeliner shes supposed to look like a sultry party girl. Instead she just looks a little hung over. Murphy has a nice bit in the park when she decides to leap off a bridge to end her life only to find that the water is only 4 feet deep. Her weary exasperated line reading when a little old lady threatens to call a cop for trespassing -- ""All right all right Im getting out"" -- is the kind of stuff she could be doing. Instead she totters around breathlessly a ditzy diva we are supposed to find irresistible. It would help if the plot were more than just an outline with a few convenient turns. Molly is presented as such a homemaking nincompoop that she starts a rampaging oven fire when she attempts to heat up chocolate-chip cookies. But she suddenly has the sewing expertise to design and stitch a leather jacket that is a sensation on a music video. The rest of the cast is mostly window dressing but Heather Locklear should be singled out. Playing Rays workaholic mother she sketches out her character with a minimum of fuss and yet is utterly convincing. Shes an icy heedless awful mom. And thats meant in the best possible way. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations and profanity. Todays Deals Columbia Mens/Womens Vent Cush Flip Sandals for 15 + free...

Avoid Uptown Girls an embarrassingly silly exercise that mostly serves as a platform for Brittany Murphy to model a fab wardrobe and glam hairstyles. Brittany Murphy stars in the lackluster Uptown Girls. By K.C. Bailey MGM Murphy stars as Molly Gunn the daughter of a rock n roll icon who died when his daughter was 8. This poor little rich girl has grown insecure and needy which coincides with her 22nd birthday as she spots the early signs of a dreaded forehead wrinkle. The club-hopping jet-setting Molly falls for sensitive singer-songwriter Neal (Jesse Spencer) seducing him in a scene were supposed to find adorable. As he bares his soul she bares her teeth cloyingly demanding he feed her Pez candies. There is absolutely no chemistry between Murphy and Spencer. In many scenes he seems to recoil from her. Though Molly complains about Neal hanging around her house when he leaves -- just to go to his apartment -- she whines that she has never felt more empty. And in a couple of days her bank account is empty too. Mollys duplicitous business manager absconded with all her money . Now the pampered Molly has to find a job. She eventually becomes a nanny to a preternaturally adult 8-year-old named Ray (Dakota Fanning) who has a sharper tongue and more smarts than Molly. Fanning who made her debut in I Am Sam is talented but her choice of movies has not been good. Still she is far more appealing than her older simpering co-star. Uptown Girls resembles a female version of the Adam Sandler hit Big Daddy. But unlike that inoffensive bore Girls sends troubling messages to children about male/female relations. (Molly sleeps with a series of men. Rays daddy lies in a coma while her mom fools around with young Neal Mollys guy.) Dont be fooled by the innocent-looking ad campaign featuring Murphy Fanning and a Babe-style piglet. This is not only unsuitable for children its a colossal waste of time at any age. (PG-13 for sexual content and language) Grind 1/2 Sitting through the teen skateboard comedy Grind is well a grind. Laughs are virtually nil despite a plethora of crude attempts at humor jokes about vomiting defecating flatulence bosomy babes. Grind has it all. Except actual humor. (Video See a trailer for the movie.) Granted adults are not the target audience. But even at a screening filled with teens laughter was a scarce commodity. Even the extreme skateboard rides are shot from dull angles. Skateboarding cutie Eric (Mike Vogel) is the most likable of a group of friends who have graduated high school and take a road trip hoping to get noticed by a touring pro skateboarder. Dustin (The O.C.s Adam Brody) the responsible one is railroaded into blowing 700 of his college fund on the odyssey. Along for the ride is the boorish Matt (Vince Vieluf) the most inane character in any summer movie including Gigli. The trio are joined by an older pal Sweet Lou (Joey Kern) a loser a few years out of high school who does nothing but hang around the local park and inspire parents to lock up their daughters. But he has the wheels so hes in the group. Eric meets a cute blonde skater Jamie (Jennifer Morrison). They fall for each other but their sweet romance is lost amid the leering and lousiness of the story. The boys are repeatedly told that if theyre good theyll get noticed. The same could be said for a movie. And this one is likely to pass by with little fanfare.

Pic offers scant appeal to males and is likely to fall between the cracks of the young teen and pre-teen female demographic. Best prospects for recoupment are on video. A light occasionally charming and reasonably well-crafted tale about a transforming female friendship ""Uptown Girls"" nonetheless may have a difficult time finding its niche. Pic offers scant appeal to males and is likely to fall between the cracks of the young teen and pre-teen female demographic given that its two leads are a 22-year-old and an 8-year-old. Best prospects for recoupment are on video. The long-in-the-works project from Manhattan-based GreeneStreet Films at least offers unusual characters. Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy) is the orphaned daughter of a wealthy rock n roller a ditzy but generous free spirit -- think of young Goldie Hawn crossed with Stella McCartney -- who enjoys a kind of Alice in Wonderland existence in her funky spacious New York digs surrounded by her dads guitar collection and cocooned by her inheritance. Ray Schleine (Dakota Fanning) might as well be on her own -- her dads in a coma; and her mother busy record executive Roma (Heather Locklear) couldnt be less interested in mothering her. To protect her feelings the 8-year-old has become a beastly control freak displaying all the most brittle aspects of adulthood. Pic meanders at the outset following 22-year-old Mollys adventures on the hip New York party scene and her misbegotten crush on a young troubadour (Jesse Spencer) who sings at her birthday party. But things begin to click when the unthinkable happens -- the party girl loses her fortune to her thieving accountant -- and is forced to find a job. Molly accepts her misfortune with good cheer but seems to have nothing to offer the workaday world. As a last resort she takes an au pair position looking after the Schleine brat arranged by a music biz friend (Donald Faison). This sets the scene for interaction between the two opposites -- the adult who needs to grow up and the child who needs to relax and act like one. Rather too suddenly Molly overcomes her general incompetence and becomes reliable and effective as the childs caretaker. Shes the one person Ray cant intimidate- who sees right through her fearsome little construct. Ultimately theres an appealing chemistry here as the two femmes break through each others barriers and develop trust in what amounts to an unusual love story. Sequence in which Molly reveals the deep-rooted source of her own reluctance to face the world as an adult followed by little Rays corresponding family crisis is quite poignant. Pics overall schematic which starts out lightweight and contrived manages some emotional truth before its over. Fluidly directed by Boaz Yakin the confection musters additional appeal as a visually intriguing valentine to New York with exteriors adeptly shot on location in the city and at Coney Island by Michael Ballhaus (""Gangs of New York""). Murphy (""Just Married"" ""Eight Mile"") struggles to carry the first part of the pic on her own but once shes paired with the remarkable Fanning (""I Am Sam"") things pick up. Still the Rays hyper-intelligence and nastiness at such a young age strains believability. Perf by Spencer a teen idol in Australia falls on the bland side and Locklear is believable but one-note in a turn with small-screen scope. Costumes by Sarah Edwards are imaginative and fun and add charm to the characters. Uptown GirlsProductionAn MGM Pictures release of a GreeneStreet Films production.

Bailey) D Uptown Girls Genre Comedy; Starring Dakota Fanning Brittany Murphy Donald Faison Heather Locklear Austin Pendleton Marley Shelton; Director Boaz Yakin; Author Julia Dahl; Release Date Wide 08/15/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 93; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor MGM Posted August 13 2003 -- 1200 AM EDT At the lavish New York gala celebration of her 22nd birthday that opens Uptown Girls Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy) the rich pampered doodle-brained daughter of a legendary dead rock star turns to her best friend and chirps ""Am I turning into a hideous hag?"" The tough-love answer ought to be Not yet sister but this tweeting has got to stop Murphys increasingly high-strung self-conscious performances composed of squeaking weeping giggling and purring to the camera threaten to become a caricature of the striking work she did in ""8 Mile"" and ""Girl Interrupted."" Then again the retro-ditsy role of Molly - who learns about adulthood from an emotionally wizened 8-year-old girl - is enough to depress even the least flibbertigibbety of actresses. When her money runs out Molly takes a job as nanny to freakily serious hypochondriac Ray (Dakota Fanning) a prissy Miss Bossy ignored by her own self-involved high-powered mama (Heather Locklear). Ray dressed like a suburban matron teaches Molly how to be responsible. Molly stumbling as cliche demands in wobbly high heels teaches Ray how to have fun. Unlike in ""Freaky Friday"" no magic spells are involved. Nor is there any of ""Freaky""s marvelous charm in this ungainly Manhattan fairy tale directed by indulgent sentimentalist Boaz Yakin (""Remember the Titans"") and inspired claims producer Allison Jacobs by haute-New York movies like ""Breakfast at Tiffany""s. Fanning is wonderfully somber and owlish as a tragicomic specimen of precocity but like every other character in the movies baubly universe in the end shes just an accessory to Mollys wardrobe of attitudinal poses.
