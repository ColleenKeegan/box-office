This week I went to a screening of the new version of ""The Mechanic"" and then went home and three clicks of a mouse later was watching the original 1972 version with Charles Bronson on my laptop. Given that Hollywood now seems to be so thoroughly invested in the remake business (or ""reboot"" if you want to sound hipper) the instant ability for a moviegoer to go back and compare and contrast a remake with the original is invaluable. Were characters changed drastically or cut? Did even a snatch of the original dialogue remain intact? Of course it doesnt take many examples (""The Italian Job"" ""Sabrina"" ""Payback"" etc.) to confirm what most of us already know Remakes are rarely made because someone has a better idea. Its usually because they just see the possibility of money being made with buzzy new stars. The studio or the producer already owns the rights to the material. And the title is familiar i.e. pre-sold. (Notice how rarely a box-office turkey gets remade. Apparently no one is clamoring for revisionist versions of ""Ishtar"" or ""Hudson Hawk."") Was there a crying need to remake ""The Mechanic""? The 1972 original starred Charles Bronson and was directed by Michael Winner (the two would reteam two years later to make the blockbuster revenge drama ""Death Wish""). Bronson plays a professional assassin skilled at making it appear that his targets have died of natural causes or in an accident. Watched today its surprisingly leisurely in its pace -- and darkly brooding. It seems as much an art-house picture -- especially in its first half -- as an action movie. The opening sequence in which Bronson carefully stakes out and sabotages a targets seedy Los Angeles apartment and then kills his victim has no dialogue and runs for more than 15 minutes. Clearly times have changed. This new ""Mechanic"" -- starring British Olympic diver-turned-action hero Jason Statham and directed by Simon West -- is faster bloodier more brutal and occasionally wittier than the original. The basic plot is the same -- Stathams hit man becomes the mentor to a younger hot-headed would-be assassin (Ben Foster taking on the role Jan- Michael Vincent played in the original). But this time around much of the action takes place in New Orleans and Chicago rather than the Los Angeles and Naples settings of the 1972 film. The new movie does retain its heros fondness for classical music though Statham dispenses with the groovy turtlenecks and red silk robe that Bronson modeled in the first film. How does Statham stack up against Bronson? Bronson had more hair a craggier face and always carried with him the sense that somewhere deep in his past he had been badly hurt. But Statham he of the chiseled physique and sexily receding hairline holds his own here doing what he has to in scenes and no more -- which is perfect for a movie like this. What the new ""Mechanic"" does have over the old one is the casting of Foster who also brought life to the remake of ""310 to Yuma."" In the original Vincent walks through the movie a punk with sun-streaked blond locks who poses and pouts. The far more gifted Foster plays the role with a hopped-up intensity that keeps you guessing about just what havoc his character might be capable of wreaking. Bottom line One film isnt better than the other; theyre just different each a reflection of its time and audience expectations. Then again if any one goes to either film expecting to see a grease monkey tuning-up cars both movies will disappoint. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Incredibly the Capital of the World is currently devoid of any places offering such amusement. The first bull will be unveiled at Johnny Utahs a Southwestern-themed restaurant set to open on July 11 at the Rockefeller Center Hotel. The bull apparatus will be featured prominently in the 6000-square-foot space and will be surrounded by cascading metal chains and burning candles. For the downtown set there may be a safer alternative. Brothers Rob and Will Shamlian who gave the Lower East Side Dark Room in 2004 and its twin Fat Baby on Rivington Street a year later will open a ""rockabilly bar/restaurant"" tentatively called Evan Ford in October at 133 Essex Street. A mechanical bull made in the Midwest specially for the bar will be located toward the back of the 3000-square-foot space. In addition to the neighborhoods ever-escalating rents the duo had to shell out some cash for um liability purposes. ""There is a special type of insurance that you have to get when you are operating a mechanical bull"" Rob Shamlian explained. ""Its pretty expensive."" Even with a couple of successful places under their belt it seems like Murray Hill--drenched in recent college grads--would be the more appropriate place for the Shamlians bull-riding eatery than the hipster-laden environs of the Lower East Side. Rob Shamlian begs to differ. ""I think it will add a lot to the neighborhood"" he told The Observer. ""And I know the hipsters will like it.""

Photo Credit CBS Films advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson flick about a professional killer BOTTOM LINE Flashy and loud but ultimately a weak substitute for the gutsy original. CAST Jason Statham Ben Foster Donald Sutherland LENGTH 132 Philosophical fortitude isnt what you normally expect from an action flick but ""The Mechanic"" is a special case. In the 1972 original Charles Bronson played a hit man who kills his best friend then hires the dead mans son - a soulless pretty boy played by Jan Michael Vincent - to help with future assignments. It was a film with no heroes only villains and it stuck to its nihilistic guns from start to brutal finish. The new version has more action louder music and harder abs in the form of Jason Statham. But its core is soft and squishy. Clinging to false heroism and terrified of anything too dark ""The Mechanic"" is a tough-guy movie for wimps. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The premise remains mostly the same. Statham plays Arthur Bishop a fix-it man for the kindly underworld figure Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland). Bishop kills him anyway - a jobs a job. At the funeral Bishop spots Harrys troubled son Steve (Ben Foster of ""The Messenger"") and decides to give the kid an outlet for his anger. ""The Mechanic"" is too gutless to accept its characters as they were originally written by Lewis John Carlino who is guilty of helping out here. Bishop kills bad guys (arms dealers drug lords) as if that makes him a good guy; the film invents another villain a double-dealing crime boss played by Tony Goldwyn to let Bishop further off the hook. Even the sociopathic Steve is absolved by a new motivation revenge. Well how convenient. The biggest moral cowards here are the filmmakers who killed the original Bishop for nothing more than a little money. VideoThe Mechanic Back story Taking falls for one of his heroes advertisement | advertise on newsday In ""The Mechanic"" action star Jason Statham takes over a role played in the original by Charles Bronson who was one of his favorite actors. ""I watched many of his movies most of them"" the British actor 38 told the Houston Chronicle. ""Probably my favorite was Hard Times. Thats a great one. Doesnt get mentioned a lot but I remember me mum and dad showed me that one years and years ago. Hes great one of the heavyweights."" A former member of the British national diving team Statham performed most of his own stunts including a jump from a high bridge into a river that certainly benefited from his athletic experience. ""You can get out the pause button You can see me all the way down. That is not a CG stunt."" But he admits there were times when he looked around and thought ""Should I really be doing this?"" ""Yeah"" he says laughing. ""Theres always that aspect. But Ive sort of dug myself a hole with doing me own stunts. And Ben Foster he put himself in the rig for the high fall outside the building. Thats a guy whos afraid of heights. When youre doing a movie you always have something to prove to yourself. And all the best rewards come from pushing yourself into areas you dont want to be.""

"The Mechanic review Assassins tale retold in over-the-top movie |       NJ.com comments The Mechanic review Assassins tale retold in over-the-top movie Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 28 2011 at 807 AM View/Post Comments CBS FILMSJason Statham in ""The Mechanic"" a remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson movie of the same name. Arthur Bishop is a troubleshooter -- and hes good at it. He travels around the world for a large corporation gets paid huge sums of money for his expertise and afterward retires to his secluded mansion to play a little classical music and toast his own prowess. Except Bishops troubleshooting involves real shooting. And now hes in real trouble. Nearly 40 years ago this was the plot of ""The Mechanic"" a lean little picture with Charles Bronson Jan-Michael Vincent and lots of scenes of high-tech assassinations and clever cover-ups. Now its once again the plot of ""The Mechanic"" a rather larger louder picture with Jason Statham Ben Foster and lots of scenes of high-tech assassinations and clever cover-ups. Movie Review The Mechanic (R) CBS (92 min.) Directed by Simon West. With Jason Statham Ben Foster. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains violence strong language drug and alcohol abuse nudity and sexual situations. Stephen Whittys Review THREE STARS The new stunts are explosive over-the-top and a sign of the times -- action fans arent happy these days it seems unless at least one scene involves a jackknifing 18-wheeler and a fireball. Or as one of the current producers explains in the publicity material ""Films of the 70s relied more on mood and atmosphere. Audiences today expect a drama that is logical and motivated."" Well actually I dont know how that explains the 18-wheeler. But the bare bones of the plot -- assassin works with a young protege until each begins to distrust the other -- are still here and still sturdy. So is Jason Statham an actor who always starts from a position of wound-tight anger -- really his whole head is clenched -- and then ratchets it up even more. Hes good as the tense assassin and Ben Foster keeps -- for once -- just enough of his scenery-chewing in check to convince as Stathams looser sometimes-losing-it partner. The attempts to update the script are less successful. Theres a corporate double cross that doesnt make much sense. And the movie works too hard to make our hitmens targets despicable (a drug boss an arms dealer a pedophile a religious fraud) and not hard enough to explain why anyone would be targeting them. Maybe if theyd cut just one scene of big things blowing up theyd have more time for some real logic and motivation. But at least action director Simon West (who made ""Con Air"" the first ""Lara Croft"" and then too much mediocre TV) knows how to keep things moving. Statham seems to be in shape and able to handle himself (both rarities among current action stars). And neither seems to be taking things so seriously they cant have some fun.

The taciturn central character played with customary impassiveness by Jason Statham does eventually experience a cognitive awakening that could almost be called an emotion. But the movie is most concerned with engineering a series of encounters between hard objects -- bullets blades screwdrivers -- and soft flesh. Nominally The Mechanic is a remake of a 1972 Charles Bronson picture. But the movie is crisp and contemporary enough to inaugurate another franchise for Statham who has starred in three Transporter movies among many other showcases for his hard physique and harder demeanor. This time Statham is Arthur Bishop a hit man with superhuman finesse and a perpetually unshaven mug. He works for a highly corporate assassination bureau -- world headquarters in a Chicago skyscraper -- that specializes in murders that cant be classified as homicides. Arthurs victims appear to have drowned or had heart attacks maybe drunk too many Red Bulls. (Actually that last one is my invention though I wouldnt put it past the film.) Arthurs longtime mentor is Harry McKenna a wheelchair-using military veteran (and a zesty cameo for Donald Sutherland). The murder corporations CEO -- known simply as Dean portrayed by Tony Goldwyn and looking amusingly like Timothy Geithner -- decrees that McKenna must be dispatched. After the deed is done Arthur experiences a twinge of empathy for McKennas screw-up of a son Steve (Ben Foster). Like most movie hit men Arthur has no human attachments (although he does always visit the same hooker). No one ever visits the tasteful bachelor pad hidden in a Louisiana bayou where Arthur proves his discernment by listening to Schubert on a high-end sound system complete with vacuum-tube amplifier. Nonetheless Arthur accepts Steve as his apprentice overlooking the latters bad attitude heavy drinking and unprofessional approach to mayhem-making. The pro gives the novice one of his own assignments which Steve turns into a bloody mess. (Thats the one with the screwdriver.) Arthur even lets Steve enter his secret bayou hideout although he draws the line at letting the kid touch the turntable. i After discovering the truth about his mentors murder Arthur (Statham foreground) takes on the mans troubled adult son (Ben Foster) as an apprentice. CBS Films hide caption toggle caption CBS Films After discovering the truth about his mentors murder Arthur (Statham foreground) takes on the mans troubled adult son (Ben Foster) as an apprentice. CBS Films Eventually the mechanic learns that Harry was set up and that Dean was responsible. Arthur and Steve head to Chicago for what might reasonably be assumed to be the last of the movies many violent set pieces. (Its not.) For his murderous masterpiece Arthur doesnt bother making the death appear to be of natural causes. Directed by Con Air pilot Simon West The Mechanic is unusually brutal for a Statham vehicle even if one of the nastiest moments is quickly revealed to be a trick. Like most Statham characters Arthur has a chivalrous streak; if he seems about to hurt a woman chances are hes bluffing. Male antagonists however tend to hit the ground hard. The Mechanic plays like one of the more ... well mechanical of the movies from John Woos Hong Kong years. The action scenes are brisk inventive and well-staged with humorous touches amid the brawling. Add a downright NPR-ish score -- featuring Senegalese bluesman Nuru Kane and D.C. electro-lounge act Thunderball as well as the Schubert -- and the film seems almost classy. Whats missing is the emotional payoff the plot demands. Every scene proceeds at the same efficient pace and the story never slows to allow any realization to register. Betrayal sympathy and regret are central to the story but theres hardly any room for such feelings amid the clockwork carnage.

Well He Can Blow It Up Jason Statham raises his taciturn action hero game opposite Ben Foster in this capable remake of Charles Bronsons macho 1972 classic By Mary Pols MaryPolsJan. 27 2011 Share Read Later Patti Perret / CBS Films /LandovJason Statham in The Mechanic Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture In the quick capable thoroughly bloody action film The Mechanic Jason Statham plays Arthur Bishop a seasoned professional who kills people for a living. If youre thinking this is not exactly a stretch for the star of the Transporter films and longtime Guy Ritchie muse ask yourself if you really want to see Statham play a befuddled professor or a distracted dad. Playing a tight-lipped brutally efficient assassin is his gift and if you have no objection to the sensation that the copious gore his characters generate threatens fly off the screen and land sloppily in your lap this gift is yours to enjoy. Arthur is in the films terminology a mechanic an assassin who carries out assignments for a nameless syndicate with a seemingly endless target list. He has two bosses one of whom Dean (Tony Goldwyn) -- a buttoned up creep who looks like hed be right at home on Capitol Hill -- he barely tolerates. But Arthur is very fond of his old mentor Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland). The wheelchair-bound rheumy-eyed Harry returns his affection even expressing some paternal concern -- upon Arthurs return from Colombia where hed neatly dispatched a drug lord in the films opening set piece -- that the hitman needs a companion. Not long after a cruel twist of the trade leaves Harry dead and lands Arthur exactly that -- in the form of his mentors estranged son Steve (Ben Foster who starred alongside Woody Harrelson in last years The Messenger) a hothead intent on avenging his fathers murder. The Mechanic directed by Simon West (Tomb Raider) is a remake of a 1972 Charles Bronson film of the same name. Like the 70s icon Statham is the strong silent type; but while Bronson played the MacGyver of assassins (in the movies first hit he takes out his mark using a gas stove a book and a teabag) Stathams Arthur has a tendency to get his hands bloody. Emotionally though hes a little softer -- guilt ridden for example over one contract that Bronsons Arthur didnt even blanch at. Its that guilt which drives him to mentor Steve McKenna; hes trying to do dead Harry a favor by at least arming this loose cannon with some skills. Bronsons Arthur in contrast is motivated to mentor Steve (played in 1972 by the ludicrously pretty Jan-Michael Vince) because he appreciates his cool criminal pathology. ""You seem to have the aptitude"" Bronson says. The new Steve has less aptitude than a vampire-like thirst for blood and a dangerous bravado. Hes the definition of the unprofessional shaking off Arthurs slick impossible-to-trace killing methods in favor of all-out bludgeoning. After he makes a stomach-turning mess of his first assignment in which he plays convincing bait for a gay mark we have no confidence in Steve as a pupil. It seems uncharacteristic of Arthur to put himself at risk by continuing to keep Steve under his wing. Nonetheless were grateful because the interplay between dry Arthur and crazy caustic Steve is what makes the movie fun. ""Couldnt you have found us someone more attractive to spy on?"" Steve complains to Arthur midway through their stakeout of an obese religious guru. Foster a slight bandy-legged actor whose intensity makes up for his lack of pretty features is just the foil Statham needs. Whereas Foster is a deeply authentic actor -- watch his eyes in the scene where he quizzes Arthur about what its like to kill someone he knows; he plays it like theres an Oscar on the line -- Statham generally seems deeply authentic only when hes strangling someone. But when reacting to Foster he practically brims with emotion (on the Statham scale at least). Its the classic case of an excellent tennis player elevating the game of his opponent. The stunts and effects are fairly typical (except perhaps for a leap from a skyscraper that felt impressively disturbingly real) and theres one of those climaxes involving explosions machine guns and countless wrecked cars in an urban center (entirely unpoliced naturally) that did nothing for me but will doubtless get the pulses of plenty of 14 year-old boys racing. I hung on though because I wanted to see mentor and mentee work out their differences. In the original no one gets out alive. Would todays natural born killers go merrily off into the sunset together? The only things approaching a sunset glow here are the fireball explosions but the films resolution like the rest of the action porn has a sly likeable quality.

Jason Statham and Ben Foster find time for some awesome ridiculous male bonding. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 28 2011 218 PM The Mechanic Jason Statham and Ben Foster find time for some awesome ridiculous male bonding. By Dana Stevens Jason Statham and Ben Foster in The Mechanic The Mechanic (CBS Films) makes you remember why movies like The Mechanic exist. On paper the story sounds rote and overfamiliar A world-class professional hitman teams up with a troubled youth to avenge the death of the young mans father who was also the hitmans mentor in the art of elite assassination. In fact the film is a remake of a 1972 thriller starring Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent. Yet this compact 90-minute fantasy of vigilante justice (written by Richard Wenk in collaboration with the writer of the original Lewis John Carlino) feels fresh and satisfying. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Maybe its the presence of Jason Statham the British action star who has a physicality like no other actor out there right now His lean athletic almost balletic grace harks back to the heyday of Steve McQueen or Bruce Lee. Or maybe its The Mechanics focus--unusual for a film of its type--on a male-male relationship thats more fraught than the usual pairing of two wisecracking buddies. Granted this movies primary concern is devising ever more creative ways for one man to hurl another off a skyscraper or through a glass coffee table. But director Simon West ( Con Air--need I say more?) has a light touch and an economy of style that turns The Mechanic into a lean mean ridiculousness machine. Advertisement Arthur Bishop (Statham) the bullet-headed elegantly cashmere-clad figure at that machines helm begins the movie as a hyper-competent and emotionally remote killer. We see him zipping around the globe in the employ of a shadow organization that targets arms dealers and other high-profile malfeasants. Arthur can drown a drug dealer in South America escape the dealers heavily defended compound and get back to New Orleans in time for drinks and sex with a compliant supermodel-gorgeous call girl (Mini Anden). Then he retires to his glass-fronted Modernist house on a bayou one of the movies many small triumphs of production design to listen to Schubert on vinyl. Arthurs life of refinement and contract murder is interrupted by the death of his longtime colleague Harry (Donald Sutherland memorable even in a brief cameo). In search of an explanation for the organizations decision to do away with his mentor Arthur crosses paths with Harrys son Steve (Ben Foster) a volatile and angry kid who drinks too much and picks fights for the wrong reasons. (""Never kill someone when you have a motive"" advises Arthur when Steve nearly beats a would-be carjacker to death.) The Arthur/Steve relationship at the movies heart is what lifts The Mechanic above the common run of kablammo action thrillers. Yes its sick that two men would bond Karate Kid-style over their shared passion for hired killing but within this movies twisted universe their bond somehow counts as touching. Taking Steve under his wing clearly represents the first time Arthur has made himself vulnerable to anyone--which makes their connection more a muted love affair than the quasi-paternal link between Bronson and Vincent in the original. I appreciated the attention that this movie paid to man-on-man relationship dynamics. Even the action sequences (which are many) often advance the emotional story. It doesnt just matter whether Steve does away with the first man Arthur entrusts him to kill on his own; it matters whether he carries out the job to his heros exacting standards. Ben Foster is a small slight man--a characteristic that was less noticeable when he played opposite Woody Harrelson in the bleak war drama The Messenger(2009). Next to Jason Statham Foster looks downright boyish and he plays Steve as a yearning fragile kid with a taste for playing gangster. Its a way more layered performance than the role requires (and better--Ill risk assassination for saying it--than Jan-Michael Vincents in the original). Statham provides the same injection of steroids as always but its a welcome rush. Those freaked out by even B-movie-style violence should be warned that The Mechanic is of full of loud thwacking gore but as in an old martial-arts movie the thwacks are gleefully and deliberately fake. There are also a few clever blackhearted sight gags (like the moment when Statham makes a just-drowned man appear to swim by manipulating his limbs from below) and a catchphrase uttered by a villain that got the movies biggest laugh at the screening I saw. And not because we were snickering ironically at it but because it was a friggin awesome catchphrase. I would love to crack you up by quoting it here but spoiling that moment would be even more reprehensible than revealing who in this nicely tooled piece of junk makes it out alive.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 28 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Jason Statham the bullet-headed British action star from the Crank and Transporter films seems like a throwback to some earlier time in movie history when tough guys didnt wear tights and masks. Last year he co-starred in Sylvester Stallones The Expendables. That role anointed Statham as the heir to the brawny action dudes of the eighties. If the one-time Olympic diver doesnt pack as much meat in the pectoral region as his predecessors hes got a puckish charm and nimbleness to compensate. Movies The Mechanic The official trailer His new movie The Mechanic is a step back even further in the past - the Charles Bronson version from 1972. Its a stripped-down action flick with guns babes tricky assassinations crisscross plotting and not too much dialogue to get in the way. The Bronson film aimed for a certain French deadpan style a cousin of Jean-Pierre Melvilles Le Samourai (1967) in which a hit man - or ""mechanic"" - named Arthur Bishop compromises his professional integrity and isolation. The new version directed by Simon West ( Con Air Lara Croft) has a deliberately minimalist retro look to it as well. To a point it works well. The superiority of ingenuity over explosions is demonstrated in the quiet opening scene in which Arthur demonstrates how he uses stealth tactics to dispatch a South American drug lord in a way that makes it look like he died of natural causes. Back in New Orleans Arthur takes a break works on his expensive car restoration listens to Schubert on vinyl on a high-grade stereo and enjoys the occasional bout of Ramp;R with a call-girl friend (Christa Campbell). But his self-contained solitary existence cant last. In the assassination business of course its hard to say who your friends are though we can guess fairly early that the rich guy (Tony Goldwyn) who serves as Arthurs agent isnt trustworthy. Arthur gets an assignment that takes him to see his old mentor in killing people Harry. Played in an incisive cameo by Donald Sutherland Harry is an old reprobate in a wheelchair whos worried about his troubled son Steve (Ben Foster The Messenger 310 to Yuma). Soon Arthur finds himself taking the young man under his wing as his apprentice in assassination. The movie kicks into gear looking initially like a grim buddy movie. Steve is as scruffy and jittery as a meth addict while Arthur is watchful and coolly professional; but the relationship increasingly appears doomed. After his training montage Steve takes on his first solo hit and does not follow instructions. The result is a sustained intense sequence of two men struggling hand-to-hand to kill each other. Were used to violence being sanitized and stylized and this scene is hair-raising. Unfortunately the sequence is an exception - other scenes of brutality feel contrived - and the movie moves in fits and starts like a jalopy with dirt in the fuel line. There just isnt enough consistent energy to light up the glum generic plot or enliven the one-dimensional performances. With its understated moody 1970s production values and amoral protagonist the movie promises a sophistication that it doesnt deliver. Still it couldnt be called a disappointment.. Given the serviceable quality of Stathams films since his breakthrough in Guy Ritchies Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) The Mechanic is right on track.

CBS FIlms Jason Statham in The Mechanic (CBS Films) CBS Films Jason Statham in The Mechanic (CBS Films) On two occasions the assassin played by Jason Statham in the despicable idiotic flick ""The Mechanic"" says you have to a certain mind-set to do the job. The same could be said for Statham.No doubt hes got a tough-guy reputation to uphold and sports cars to collect and English castles to buy. So he cant afford to hold out for a movie with sympathetic characters a coherent script or a competent director. But you should.Even by the sloppy soulless standards of hit man movies ""The Mechanic"" is a mess. Statham plays a stoic killer named Arthur Bishop who does dirty jobs on behalf of a mysterious but presumably federal employer. Bishop displays no conscience or even personality but apparently the target audience of angry young white men is supposed to conclude that hes a good guy because his bayou hideout has a vintage stereo and because the victims include a Latino a gay a moralizer and an old cripple. The traitor who is shot point-blank in a wheelchair is Bishops ex-mentor Harry McKenna (shamefully played by Donald Sutherland). After the burial Bishop meets Harrys estranged hot-headed son Steve (Ben Foster back in psycho mode after the promising detour of ""The Messenger""). Steve believes Harry was killed by a carjacker -- and thus he takes revenge against the first black thug he can find -- so out of some kind of sublimated guilt Bishop offers the mixed-up kid a job.Soon the sociopathic pair is staging elaborate hits for which Steve is both inexplicably qualified and absurdly resilient. Scaling a high-rise hotel in broad daylight to suffocate a fat faith-healer? No sweat. Hijacking vehicles and machine-gunning henchmen on the streets of New Orleans without attracting the cops? Its called professionalism mate.""The Mechanic"" a rote remake of a Charles Bronson vehicle takes four decades worth of action-movie cliches flattens them into a tin contraption and drives them off a cliff.

Photo Mini Anden tries to interest a hit man but the killers seem more interested in killing. ( ) Short fast and nasty ""The Mechanic"" is a loose remake of Michael Winners 1972 action thriller starring Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent thats considerably more fun than the rather lethargic original. Credit no-nonsense British action star Jason Statham (""The Transporter"") and intense character actor Ben Foster who stole ""310 to Yuma"" from stars Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. Statham plays Arthur a cool world-class professional assassin who prides himself on doing what he calls ""assignments"" without leaving a trace -- as we see in a skillfully staged opening sequence. Arthurs approach is exactly the opposite of Fosters Steven -- the hot-headed messy neer-do-well son of Arthurs recently deceased mentor -- who the killer has decided to take on as his apprentice. What the classical-music-loving Arthur doesnt mention to Steven is that Arthur rubbed out Dad (Donald Sutherland) at the behest of Dads business partner (Danny Goldwyn). Steven is fascinated with Arthurs lifestyle and working with Steven provides Arthur the sort of human contact hes obviously long avoided. Though its clear this twisted father-and-son-type relationship is going to end badly there is suspense in how it will play out. Under the direction of Simon West (""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"") the New Orleans-set action -- the boys targets include a Colombian drug lord and a large gay hit man -- moves so briskly that it makes most contemporary action films look positively pokey. The script co-credited to Oscar nominee Lewis John Carlino is full of clever twists and smart one-liners. At one point Goldwyns character warns Arthur ""Im gonna put a price on your head so big that when you look in the mirror your reflections gonna want to shoot you in the face."" Statham and Foster have great chemistry bordering on the homoerotic -- they certainly seem to enjoy each others company more than the scantily clad women their characters have sex with from time to time. Theyre a huge improvement on Bronson who tended to walk through many of his films like a zombie and Vincent whose laid-back surfer-dude persona is far less interesting than the tightly coiled unpredictable Foster. ""The Mechanic"" is by far the best film so far from the latest incarnation of CBS Theatrical Films which has brought us such losers as ""Extraordinary Measures"" ""The Back-Up Plan"" and ""Faster."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Anthony Hopkins wants to play Hitchcock on screen Read Next Anthony Hopkins wants to play Hitchcock on screen Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 38634 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20496 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20190 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Fernandez Kurt Deville LaTeace Towns-Cuellar Monica Acosta Director Simon West Running time 140 Release Opened Jan 28 2011  Editorial Review A rebuilt engine on an old modelBy John AndersonFriday January 28 2011Many movies make us ask why. With ""The Mechanic"" its more like ""Why now?"" Nearly 40 years ago the original film put Charles Bronson on the road to box-office immortality. This time we get the sleeker buffer balder Jason Statham as Arthur Bishop -- hit man extraordinaire connoisseur of music wine and large-caliber weaponry a man whose only potential flaw is his own conscience. And? Its been done. On the other hand what hasnt? But the idea of remakes we thought was to entice viewers with an existing memory of the original and/or its star. And to judge by all available evidence 50-year-olds arent the target demographic of any Hollywood studio that isnt called RKO. As it turns out ""The Mechanics"" producers have been trying to get a remake off the ground for years (17 to be exact) and things as they tend to do in Hollywood suddenly came together They got Statham on board as well as the eminently suitable Simon West (director of ""Con Air"" and ""Lara Croft"" among others). Richard Wenk updated the existing Lewis John Carlino script with some clever acknowledgments of the decades elapsed. Its still an action thriller of course and thus in thrall to its own brainlessness. But despite a certain emotional chill what holds this ""Mechanic"" together is -- no surprise -- the core Carlino story. Arthur is ruthless cold-blooded efficient and ingenious the latter two qualities being what makes him interesting. The original ""Mechanic"" was rather famous for its dialogue-free opening in which Bronson both stalked his prey and exhibited his shall we say craft. Wenks tweak is both homage and reinvention and it sets an intelligent tone for what is going to be a blood bath of a movie. And yet the heart of it all remains the relationship between Arthur and Steve McKenna (Ben Foster) who was played in the first film by Jan-Michael Vincent (where did he go?). Arthur has out of professional necessity killed Steves father Harry (Donald Sutherland) who was his longtime associate and only friend. Steve doesnt know this and Arthur doesnt tell him but he does take the younger man under his lethal wing training him the finer points of contract killing and setting the stage for a revenge scenario of (minor) Greek proportions. The action is good and the storyline takes great care not to be the comedy it might have become Arthur is after all supposed to be a surgical practitioner of the executioners art. Even though the game is about stealth Steve blunders through each assignment with the finesse of a meat mallet. It makes for buckets of movie mayhem but if you look at it a certain way its kind of funny. One of the more striking things about this retooled ""Mechanic"" is how visually sophisticated weve all become even in the past 10 years. In lots of cases what passed for mainstream cinema in 1972 wouldnt get on television today and ""The Mechanic"" 2011 edition is a striking-looking work combining an arty inkiness with a retro-graininess that more or less screams 1970s albeit without the cliches and flatness. If only you liked the people in the picture. Statham does what he does -- his characters are all business all the time but usually there are people on the margins who care about such characters giving them a human dimension. Fosters Steve is a weasely bit of business. His fathers decent (Sutherland always is) but hes off to Kingdom Come very early on (no spoiler there). The villains naturally are unspeakable Wenks best invention such as it is is Vaughn (John McConnell) a corpulent cult leader with an appetite for young girls who gets his just desserts. And this is of course why these movies continue to have afterlives even 40 years on providing in their way a kind of (death) wish fulfillment.Contains violence vulgarity sex nudity.

Photo Patti Perret CBS Films Mechanic review Architect of doom gets job done 1 / 5 Back to Gallery The Mechanic Drama. Starring Jason Statham Ben Foster and Tony Goldwyn. Directed by Simon West. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Somebody had the right idea in the making of ""The Mechanic"" an action movie short on brains but long on attitude. Its not grand opera or an excuse for overcaffeinated crosscutting. There are just one or two explosions and those explosions are welcome - at no point do the filmmakers try to explode their way out of telling a story. And what a story it is. To the extent it makes sense its a collection of time-honored cliches and to the extent that its original ""The Mechanic"" is insane bordering on gloriously insane. The title character played by Jason Statham is a hit man of a variety often seen in movies not a thug not a hired gun but an architect of doom practically an artist at killing people. When we first meet him he drowns a man in his swimming pool even as the unhappy fellow is being watched over by armed bodyguards. Leave the logic behind He is able to accomplish this for the simple reason that his hapless victim has dark blue water in his pool. Now think about that. Most people have clear water in their pools precisely for this purpose to prevent paid assassins from hiding out on the bottom in scuba gear. But what can one say to a guy so tough that he purifies his swimming pool with Ty-D-Bol? Now contrary to rumor there are not two kinds of people in the world but three (1) People who will decide that blue water is implausible and will count that against the movie; (2) People who wont notice that blue water is weird; and (3) People who will realize that swimming in Ty-D-Bol is demented but will like the movie for that very reason. That is for its absurdity and audacity. If based on experience you think youd be in the first category you have permission to stop reading. Everybody else lets keep going. The Mechanics boss in the assassination business is played by Tony Goldwyn a character actor whose career is similar to that of Danny Huston but with subtle differences. Huston is who you get to play an out-and-out sleaze. Goldwyn is who you get to play a sleaze that maybe you are supposed to think isnt a sleaze even though you know he is. Sleaze or not Goldwyn gets off the one line from this movie worth repeating ""Im gonna put a price on your head so big that when you look in the mirror your reflection is gonna want to shoot you in the face."" The loopy partner For reasons that really make no sense except that its fun for the audience our hero takes on a partner the wastrel son of a deceased friend. So we get Statham whose action manner is cold efficient observant physical deadpan and monosyllabic paired with Ben Foster in his loony ""310 to Yuma"" mode - sloppy mercurial and very angry - a high-spirited type who cant pass a fireplace without wanting to beat someone to death with a poker. What these fellows have in common besides their size coloring and the fact that theyre played by compulsively watchable screen actors is that theyre badasses in the best way. Its the difference between a movie that clicks and one that doesnt. ""The Mechanic"" pairs two guys and to see them walk into a room together is to look forward to their demolishing the place. The movie devises some clever scenes for them some tense some funny some both. The fact that the partnership is in the terms set down by the story a colossal failure - the Mechanic goes from being a surgeon to a butcher - is something not recognized as a problem by the protagonists. If youre still reading this it probably wont bother you either. -- Advisory This film contains a sex scene filmed like an action scene - lots of quick cuts and its over. Very funny but not intentionally. Also plenty of scenes of violence which fortunately are not filmed like sex scenes.

"The Mechanic Made for good brutal fun - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather The Mechanic Made for good brutal fun By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Updated | |   | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Lets take a moment to appreciate Jason Statham. Hes not the best actor in Hollywood. Or the handsomest. But the guy knows his wheelhouse and no one seems to enjoy playing the action hero as much as he does. By Patti Perret CBS Films Steve McKenna (Ben Foster left) and Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) find they have something in common their target. EnlargeClose By Patti Perret CBS Films Steve McKenna (Ben Foster left) and Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) find they have something in common their target. Fitting then that Statham is the motor within The Mechanic the Charles Bronson remake that stands as the first legitimate action film of 2011. Brisk brutal and unconcerned with collateral damage The Mechanic doesnt pave much of anything new in the assassin-for-hire genre. But when it kills it does so with style. Statham plays Arthur Bishop a ""mechanic"" happy to tune someone up or take a mark to the salvage yard if the money is right. He doesnt sympathize with his targets nor does he offer them many quips or explanations. Hes not as stone-faced and silent as Bronson was in the 1972 original but by todays chatty action hero standard hes nearly mute. Bishop is tasked with eliminating an unfortunate target Harry his mentor played with effective resignation by Donald Sutherland. It would be easy to make that the crux of a disposable action romp Killer has second thoughts teams with mentor and wipes out the real bad guys. But director Simon West makes it clear early on that our hero doesnt have much capacity for mercy even when he meets Harrys son Steve (Ben Foster) a wannabe killer who is ignored by Daddy. The Mechanic   1/2 out of four Stars Jason Statham Ben Foster Donald Sutherland Director Simon West Distributor CBS Films Rating R for strong brutal violence throughout language some sexual content and nudity Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Again The Mechanic treads dangerous water as the film flirts with becoming a buddy flick. But Statham does a nice job of playing a guy who really doesnt need a shoulder to lean on. And Steve isnt looking for a shoulder to cry on. Foster in particular shines. He has always been compelling as a bit player in films like 310 to Yuma and The Messenger. But here he commands the film every time hes in it especially when in hand-to-hand contact with thugs -- and appearing to get the worst of it. The Mechanic wont be confused for art-house drama anytime soon. The men are tough the women are beautiful and folks like to walk in slow motion from exploding vehicles. But credit it for making the action and violence unflinching at a time when television has blurred whats acceptable viewing. Hand-to-hand fights are desperate a la the Bourne series. Gunmen take the shot when they have it; they dont wait to say something pithy. And when someone gets hit by a car you can bet that grill will need to be washed down. Its not Shakespeare. But Statham isnt here to proclaim the world a stage. For him and luckily us its a cage match. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Courtesy New Line Cinema. By Joe Morgenstern Updated Jan. 28 2011 1201 a.m. ET According to Father Lucas an allegedly legendary exorcist played by Anthony Hopkins reliable proof of demonic possession involves knowledge of the unknowable--an ability in the example offered by one of his subjects to divine the presence of a dollar bill hidden from view. ""The Rite"" set mostly in Rome and the Vatican proves that yet another cabal of producers divining the presence of dollars in unknowable numbers of wallets has been possessed by the belief that the world is ready for another movie about exorcism. This one an overwrought thriller with a surfeit of solemnity and the devils own sound design first distances itself from the conventions of the genre. Father Lucas comes on as an honest tradesman who sees exorcism as a sort of spiritual colonic a procedure that must periodically be repeated. ""What did you expect?"" he asks a skeptical young seminarian from America who becomes his apprentice ""Spinning heads? Pea soup?"" If only. Linda Blairs rotations and regurgitations were a lot more fun than this movies pseudo-theological lucubrations on the subject of skepticism faith and the never-ending battle against evil. (The director Mikael Hafstrom actually made a Swedish-language movie called ""Evil"" which earned an Oscar nomination seven years ago. This time hes working from a screenplay by Michael Petroni thats ponderous enough to banish Oscar anxiety for all concerned when next years nominations are announced.) ENLARGE Anthony Hopkins as a veteran exorcist and Colin ODonoghue as his protege in The Rite. Warner Bros. Pictures The seminary student Michael Kovak is played by Colin ODonoghue; its a flat attempt at a soulful portrayal and all the more damaging because the movie is focused more on Michaels dogged quest for the truth about demons than on Father Lucass struggles with them. (The son of a mortician Michael keeps flashing back to childhood memories of an especially significant corpse lying supine on an autopsy table. ""Dont be afraid"" the boys father tells him brightly. ""Its just your mother."") The conventions of the genre are resurgent of course. A victim of possession played with grand-guignol gusto by Marta Gastini responds to Father Lucass ministrations with elaborate writhings and squirmings; a male victim wouldnt have given the genre its requisite sexual charge. Ben Daviss burnished cinematography gives the production an elegance it hasnt earned. Dave Whiteheads sound design fills the production with ominous whooshings that sometimes overwhelm the dialogue not that the dialogue doesnt deserve it. Mr. Hopkins gives the production what he was hired for. Whenever you wonder how much longer he can trade on Hannibal Lecters special zest the same answer comes up--a lot. This time his emphasis is on verbal and emotional dynamics. Each battle with old Beelzebub begins calmly matter-of-factly then generates a lather of accusatory wrath before subsiding into the equivalent of an all-in-a-days-work shrug. Father Lucas does bring impressive equipment to the final battle. By that time though youre ready to give the devil whatever due it takes to get ""The Rite"" over and done with. The Mechanic Watch a clip from ""The Mechanic"" a new action film starring Jason Statham. Courtesy CBS Films ENLARGE Jason Statham as a hit man in The Mechanic. CBS Films Jason Statham is Arthur Bishop a vengeful hit man in an excruciatingly amped-up remake of the 1972 original that starred Charles Bronson. (Richard Wenk wrote the new screenplay with the original writer Lewis John Carlino. The credits also list 15 producers.) Arthur isnt one for showing his feelings--thus the mechanic moniker--so it makes sense that the granite-faced Mr. Bronson has given way to another star schooled in the art of impassivity. But Mr. Statham the specialist in English tough guys who was so affecting in ""The Bank Job"" has more to offer than ""The Mechanic"" has the grace to receive. The director Simon West pummels us with action sequences (seldom have so many chases been chased to so little effect) and punishes us with exceedingly violent killings. (This 92-minute movie has a piercing-and-puncture fetish.) Donald Sutherland lends his leonine presence to the proceedings while the excellent American actor Ben Foster does what he can--quite a bit really--with the role of Arthurs protege and then partner Steve a younger man with a complex connection to his mentor. Still ""The Mechanic"" is as shallow as the Louisiana bayous that Arthur travels in an air boat. Toward the beginning of the film someone tells him that a treacherous new target must be removed because ""he has crossed his Rubicon."" Long before the end Id crossed my Lethe.  And The Oscar Goes To... Nominees for the 83rd annual Academy Awards were announced January 25. Who should take top honors this year? Cast your vote. Natalie Portman in Black Swan Variety may be a shadow of its former self in the Internet age of infinite buzz about showbiz but the venerable trade paper can still come up with a terrific if politically incorrect headline. ""ITS STAMMER TIME"" Variety proclaimed earlier this week after the Oscar nominations were dominated by ""The Kings Speech."" Does that dominance predict more of the same when the Oscars are handed out next month? Apart from stating the happily obvious that Colin Firth has a next-to-unbreakable lock on an Oscar for best actor I dont want to get into the prediction game--at least not right now though Ill have to make my annual public guesses before the ceremonies. But I do want to note a few things about the nominations--or should I say the noms since Variety coined that term decades before legions of media kibitzers turned it into an affectation. ENLARGE Jacques Herlin as Amedee and Michael Lonsdale as Luc in Of Gods and Men. Sony Pictures Classics The decision to allow 10 best-picture nominations has worked out well once again. Last years opening-up of the category--a reopening in the context of Academy history--made it possible for ""The Hurt Locker"" to win. This year such worthy contenders as ""The Fighter"" ""The Kids Are All Right"" and ""Winters Bone"" have made the list. None is likely to win but its wonderful that theyve been recognized. Of the five nominees for best actor all gave admirable performances but where was Ryan Gosling? What he did in ""Blue Valentine"" was as best as acting gets. His co-star Michelle Williams got a best-actress nomination and a richly deserved one. So did Jennifer Lawrence a thrilling long shot in a category that properly recognized Annette Bening Nicole Kidman and Natalie Portman. This year the voting members of the Academys actors branch have not only chosen well but surprisingly so in the case of Javier Bardem a formidable star in a difficult movie. Its also good to see nominations in the supporting categories for Amy Adams John Hawkes Jacki Weaver Christian Bale and Geoffrey Rush though the latter two men lent support to their films by giving star-stature performances. I agree with those who have expressed dismay at Christopher Nolans exclusion as best director. ""Inception"" opened while I was on vacation and my feelings were mixed when I caught up with it but the film is clearly a directors showcase. Im sorry that ""Unstoppable"" got stopped and glad that ""Toy Story 3"" straddled both the best-picture and animated-feature categories like a gentle Colossus. The one flagrant miscarriage of justice was perpetrated by the foreign-film selection committee which has managed to sustain its long-standing reputation for getting things wrong. How could Xavier Beauvoiss sublime ""Of Gods and Men"" have been ignored? Several other foreign-language triumphs opened last year among them ""Mother"" and ""A Prophet."" But the Beauvois film was on the Academys long list then got dropped for the final cut. Thats not just negligence its a desastre.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Before making ""Death Wish together Charles Bronson and director Michael Winner reconnoitered the territory with 1972s ""The Mechanic an urban thriller casting Bronson as a meticulous hit man teaching his craft to young sociopath Jan-Michael Vincent. The movie was years ahead of ""CSI with some of its forensics-minded assassination schemes and gave Bronson a grubbily entertaining vehicle for killing laconically (not to mention lounging around in a Hef robe sipping merlot and perusing dossiers). Winners ""Mechanic also isnt widely remembered quickly ditches its stealth concept for routine gunplay and chases and can rise or fall depending on your appreciation of Vincents period-groovy talents.In other words there was reason enough for producers David Winkler and Bill Chartoff sons of the originals producers to think the movie merited a remake. But what we get from Jason Statham sidekick Ben Foster (""The Messenger) and director Simon West (""Lara Croft Tomb Raider) is an intermittently arresting mostly standard action entry that deals death noisily more than cleverly -- a lot like the original.Dispensing with the winking of ""The Transporter and his other signature gigs Statham plays Arthur Bishop as all stoicism a contract killer based in New Orleans but who mainly skips the bon temps to work and then retreat to his luxe hideout/ops center on the bayou. Bishop develops the tiniest chink in his emotional armor when a corporate baddie (Tony Goldwyn) gives him an assignment to take out their mutual associate and Bishops mentor Harry (Donald Sutherland having fun as a mellowed wheelchair-using hardcase). Enter Foster in the Vincent role as Harrys son Steve an angry screw-up who doesnt know the story behind his fathers death but who nevertheless guilts Bishop into taking him on as a trainee.Foster pours the character his usual shot of twitchy damaged volatility part of a makeover meant to lend greater logic to the storys master-and-apprentice bond. This Steve is a lost soul searching for direction not a mob brat killing for sport. Makes sense at least until the motivationally muddled finale.As for Bishop and Steves various dirty deeds well logic isnt everything. Why specifically does one tense high-rise set piece sic them on a televangelist? Who knows? Is there some dramatically defensible reason for making a hulking rival mechanic (Jeff Chase) a hustler-trolling swinger? Hardly. But Chases knock-down drag-out with Foster in undercover-tease mode certainly is a brutal little marvel of fight choreography. A mutilation-by-garbage-disposal scene is another niftily ugly trick.So much for doing things quickly and cleanly though. ""The best jobs are the ones nobody ever knows you were there Statham says in an opening voice-over following a cunning swimming-pool hit that has it all over Bronsons intro. Youll wish this new ""Mechanic bought into the idea completely.Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

The hero is one of those cool existential hit men whove been strolling across movie screens at least since Jean-Pierre Melvilles Le Samourai (1967) and while that pop mythology was still relatively fresh back in Bronsons day its so played out at this point that not even the enjoyably no-nonsense Statham can pump any life into it. The plot has him icing his old mentor (Donald Sutherland) on orders from their murder-for-hire organization then reluctantly schooling the dead mans unsuspecting son (Ben Foster) in the mechanics of killing.

Once.Solemn slick and pretty much pointless this anabolic remake of the 1973 Charles Bronson (and Jan-Michael Vincent) B-movie follows ace assassin Arthur Bishop (Statham) as he pulls off a series of hits that are so good they look like accidents.He gets a target and a fat envelope of bills and then orchestrates a series of elaborate moves ending in a kill. And then he retires to his mid-century modern abode on the water near New Orleans puts on his favorite vinyl grabs a drink and contemplates his existence in stylish solitude.He has a hooker girlfriend in the French Quarter but while she seems ready to forgo payment and make something more of the relationship Arthur wants to keep it all business. (Their sex scene is an unintentional parody of a quick-cut naked-body-parts montage. And its over practically before its begun.)So Arthur has compartmentalized his life completely.But all that changes when the jumpy rich kid played by Foster enters the picture. And so like a bad guys version of a buddy cop movie Arthur and Steve start working together and knocking people off together.Director Simon West and his stunt crew and second unit team negotiate some solid if soulless action sequences (exploding gas stations a high-rise rooftop shootout a garbage truck/bus/SUV kaboomer). Statham the tough terse Transporter star plays it yes tough and terse. Which gives Foster plenty of room to go angsty and Method-y. The actor hasnt met a twitch he didnt like.If The Mechanic is about anything its about trust and betrayal guilt and redemption. But wait it really isnt about that stuff - its about gunplay and pricey sports cars bursting into flames while three or four cameras capture the moment. In slo-mo.

Directed by Con Air auteur Simon West The Mechanic is all business the solitary assassin and his mentor (Donald Sutherland) the latters neer-do-well son (Ben Foster) double-cross payback and guns guns guns. Where Bronson without benefit of computers and miniature video cameras had the blue-collar gravitas of working -- well killing -- with his hands Statham conveys serene metrosexual assurance. His unruffled Arthur Bishop is as much IT specialist as assassin Bond without the wit Bourne without the psychological trauma. His armory is stocked by Glock and Apple and his vintage-chic bayou hideout is fit for a Dwell profile. (""Mr. Bishop likes to restore tube amps and Jaguars in his weekend home just a short boat ride from New Orleans..."") That Fosters worshipful apprentice begins to dress and behave just like his teacher then moves into his home gives The Mechanic a strong gay vibe. And when Foster does in fact go cruising to kill a rival hitman its like neither man can agree whos the top. In the original Bronson worked for the mob. Here Statham Sutherland and Foster are employed by smug suits in Learjets. If they seem sad and obsolete so they are -- The Company Men with guns but no families or pensions. All they have is their job and retirement literally equals death.

"The Mechanic Standard Statham stuff | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Mechanic Standard Statham stuffJason Stathams truculent expressionless performance in The Mechanic is interchangeable with all his previous efforts.Jason Statham Ben Foster star in The Mechanic.  (HANDOUT)  By Greg QuillBooks ColumnistThu. Jan. 27 2011 The Mechanic (out of 4) Starring Jason Statham Ben Foster Donald Sutherland Tony Goldwyn. Directed by Simon West. 92 minutes. At major theatres. 18A Touted erroneously as a remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson action flick than as a thriller with post 9/11 implications The Mechanic is a tediously contrived Jason Statham vehicle by British director Simon West (Con Air Lara Croft Tomb Raider). It is very much its own beast whose links to the original are limited to the anti-hero lead characters job description (paid assassin) and whose socio-political context is well absent. With the exception of its troublesome morality -- why we should be asking ourselves are we meant to be empathizing with a sociopath who blinks only once at the prospect of accepting a contract to off his wheelchair-bound mentor and employer? -- The Mechanic is a contemporary shoot-em-up with lots of brooding attitude. There are a couple of twists that arent much of a surprise at all guns and blood galore some gaudy special effects and an average dose of action stunts that defy logic and the laws of physics. In other words standard Statham stuff. The story such as it is doesnt bear much scrutiny. Still a bit sore from having capped his boss (given a decent semblance of vulnerable humanity by Donald Sutherland who steals every scene hes in) the efficient and tidy killer Arthur Bishop (Statham) makes an uncharacteristic choice. Out of sympathy -- and against all reason -- Bishop takes on his victims revenge-bent and wayward son Steve McKenna (Ben Foster memorable for his ticking time-bomb portrayals in 310 To Yuma and The Messenger) as an apprentice. Steve has no idea what role Bishop played in his dads demise and happily signs on. Trouble is Steve is sloppy and dangerous. He loves his new job a little too much and leaves an embarrassing mess when Bishop having trained the nervous acolyte in the clean in-and-out niceties of his nefarious trade sets him up with the contract murder of a gigantic homosexual assassin in the employ of a rival organization. A second hit job the murder of a fat and self-serving televangelist -- why hes targeted I cant remember but in this murky moral universe his size and repulsive ego seem reason enough -- is even more of a disaster. Still it does give the filmmaker a good spot in the plot to unload a number of big stunts including our two killers rappelling halfway down the face of a hotel. Chalking Steves misdeeds up to first-time jitters Bishop perseveres with his volatile charge even providing accommodation in his gorgeous state-of-the-art techno-geek lair a magnificent glass and dark-wood mansion hidden deep in a dank Louisiana bayou. When Bishop learns he was conned into killing Steves father by a duplicitous partner in the company for which he works he sets out with his accomplice to right the wrongs or wrong the rights or make the wrongs even wronger ... whatever. More mayhem for those who thrive on this stuff is clearly in the making even though Bishop seems oblivious to the obvious that sooner or later the apprentice will stumble on the identity of his fathers killer and seek his own revenge. Its morality -- or lack thereof -- notwithstanding theres very little in The Mechanic that differentiates it from any other Statham opus. Its a genre flick a contemporized update of the noir-killer-thriller-action template previously perfected by franchise-minded one-note actors in past generations (Bronson Chuck Norris Dolph Lundgren Jean-Claude Van Damme) but bulked up with better stunts and bigger brighter louder effects and fast-paced digital editing. Stathams truculent expressionless performance is interchangeable with all his previous truculent expressionless efforts which probably works in his favour given the size of his fan base. But as Steve Foster can act and he does bring a sliver of complexity and genuine conflict to his twitchy character even within its predictable parameters. If this movie remains in the collective memory at all it will likely be on his account. And for one great laugh line comes -- like a knowing wink from writers Lewis John Carlino who wrote the Bronson original and Richard Wenk -- when Bishop informs his nemesis played with typically cold villainy by Tony Goldwyn that his days are numbered. ""Oh yeah?"" the corporate killer replies. ""Well Im gonna put such a high price on your head that when you look at yourself in the mirror your reflection is gonna shoot you in the face"" Not immortal words exactly but somehow satisfactorily defining.

"Retooling a tale via body count - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Mechanic -- 1 starRetooling a tale via body count70s version featured actionthis one highlights violenceJanuary 26 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticThe cheap cruddy remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson vehicle ""The Mechanic"" has been rejiggered for Jason Statham and 10 times the brutality. ""Every man has his jelly spot"" Bronson told Jan-Michael Vincent in the original in and among the copious philosophizing absent from the new version. Here the jelly spots are the skulls that go splooey each time were treated to an Xbox-inspired M-rated kill shot. Lets not denigrate the term ""action film"" by applying it to the remake signed by director Simon West (""Con Air"" ""The Generals Daughter""). This is a violence film not an action film. Statham scowling so that his eyes seem to be receding into his sockets plays the cultured sophisticated man about town who makes a fine living assassinating various anonymous subhumans for his powerful employer. When his boss (Tony Goldwyn the only one worth watching in a strikingly weak supporting cast) assigns him to eliminate his own boss (Donald Sutherland) our man Arthur develops a moral twinge. But he does what he must and then guiltily takes on the dead mans wastrel son (Ben Foster in the Vincent role) as a protege. The grungy distinction of the old Michael Winner-directed ""Mechanic"" came in its cat-and-mouse games. Once the newbie assassin learns who killed his father the question becomes Who will off whom and how? However minor the Bronson movie had its bizarre soul-searching streak as well as the sight of Bronson and Vincent running around with guns their copious Nixon-era hair flopping in the breeze. Statham not so much. Whats remarkable about the remake is its nastiness. Set in New Orleans photographed to look like the dullest city on Earth ""The Mechanic"" turns Fosters character into a man who enjoys the slaughter. The enjoyment is not infectious. ""Ive always had this anger inside me"" he seethes at one point a few reels after nearly kicking an African-American carjacker to death and then killing a homosexual lout targeted by the Company. The filmmakers want it both ways with this man comic relief (isnt it funny to see him with his little Chihuahua?) and stone-cold freak though admirably emotion-free when it comes to piling up bodies. Pile up they do. Stathams a solid mass on which to build a revenge thriller and he did well by another remake ""The Italian Job."" That at least was a remake worth the remaking. But only Fosters itchy creativity as an actor keeps ""The Mechanic"" from stinking through and through. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for strong brutal violence throughout language some sexual content and nudity) Cast Jason Statham (Arthur Bishop); Ben Foster (Steve); Donald Sutherland (Harry); Tony Goldwyn (Dean Sanderson); Mini Anden (Sarah) Credits Directed by Simon West; written by Richard Wenk and Lewis John Carlino based on the 1972 screenplay ""The Mechanic""; produced by David Winkler Bill Chartoff and Rene Besson.

The Mechanic (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Mechanic (R) Loose remake of the Charles Bronson staple is more of the same-old Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald1/26/2011 Editor rating 2 The Mechanic a loose remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson drive-in staple feels instantly familiar even if you havent seen the original. Havent we already had enough movies about solitary enigmatic hit men? Is there anything possibly left to do with the genre thats new? The answer according to director Simon Wests slick fast-paced time-killer would seem to be no. Jason Statham reprising the same stoic no-nonsense demeanor he sports in practically every film (The Transporter Death Race The Expendables) stars as Arthur Bishop a killer-for-hire who is given various assignments. Some are meant to look like accidents others to send a message. Arthurs favorites though are the missions in which no one even knew he was there such an opening sequence in which he takes out a drug-cartel leader in ingenious fashion making the death look like an accidental drowning. Arthur is the sort of guy who can slip in and out of a fortress undetected and can snap a mans neck with one quick twist. He is also a true soldier never questioning the orders handed down by his superior (Tony Goldwyn). So when hes assigned to rub out his mentor Harry (Donald Sutherland) he does so remorsefully believing Harry betrayed the shady organization that employs them. Then he meets Harrys trouble-prone son Steve (Ben Foster) and makes him his protege teaching him the rules of their wet work. Steve is a slow and messy learner but he carries out his first mission and proves to have the mettle for this dangerous business. The Mechanic which was written by Richard Wenk and Lewis John Carlino (who oddly once directed the 1983 teen-sex comedy Class) follows the teacher-student relationship as it develops making you wait for the inevitable moment when Steve discovers that Harry offed his father. The movie has a couple of nice set pieces such as a carefully planned execution in a hotel room that goes horribly wrong. But even when there are guns blazing and stuff blowing up all over the place the action feels dull and uninvolving. But this is the kind of picture where characters are defined by the way they relish their vinyl LP collections which tells us nothing other than they are more analog than digital. The Mechanic remains singularly uninvolving -- a rote exercise in a genre with characters so familiar they barely register. Cast Jason Statham Ben Foster Tony Goldwyn Donald Sutherland Jeff Chase.

The Mechanic Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2011) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-mechanic-2011,200,themechanic25,themechanic,rogerebert
"Mechanic The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mechanic-the ) Mechanic The (United States 2011) January 25 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Simon Wests The Mechanic is a loose remake of the 1972 film starring Charles Bronson. In addition to updating various aspects of the story the filmmakers have changed elements (most notably the ending) in an attempt to make it more audience friendly. Overall the 2011 version of The Mechanic is superior when it comes to presenting action scenes and keeping the overall energy level high. It is noticeably inferior however on a psychological level and the storyline suffers from several hiccups. The Mechanic is adequate light entertainment for those who enjoy thrillers but it is uneven and the underwhelming ending will disappoint those who enjoyed the delicious irony served up by its predecessor. Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a paid assassin who hires out his unique services to a shadowy ""Company."" Hes a perfectionist who loves developing scenarios. He never simply kills - he devises a complex scheme to rid the world of that person. Bishops mentor Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland) has fallen under suspicion by the Companys top ranking official (Tony Goldwyn) of leaking sensitive information. Bishop is assigned to eliminate Harry a task he carries out with cool regret. At the cemetery he encounters Harrys son Steve (Ben Foster) and on a whim takes the younger man under his wing. Steve proves to be an adept pupil and he is soon accompanying Bishop on jobs even though his apprenticeship has not been sanctioned by the Company. In Hollywood although perhaps nowhere else theres such at thing as the ""hooker with a heart of gold."" In The Mechanic we encounter the ""hit man with a heart of gold."" Bishop is a suave cultured individual who apparently only kills people who have it coming. A drug kingpin an illegal arms dealer a cult leader - its tough to feel much sorrow for the people taken out by Bishop and Steve. Maybe thats why the ending re-write was necessary. Bishop is such an upstanding citizen that the irony no longer has its sting. It doesnt take an observer of cinematic trends to recognize that Jason Statham has become typecast. Its hard to imagine him playing any role outside of his narrow comfort zone. Hes the tough-talking rogue in Guy Ritchie films the Transporter or the hard-to-kill lunatic in Crank. Bishop isnt light years away from any of Stathams previous characters. It would be interesting to see what Stathams interpretation of Mr. Darcy might be. Perhaps only in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Ben Foster makes an effective sidekick and provides the only (brief) sampling of acting not basted in testosterone. Theres not much chemistry between Statham and Foster but despite the teacher/student relationship this isnt the kind of film where deep or lasting bonds are forged. The films resolution is awkward. It feels contrived and out-of-place. Theres a reason for that. With a significant variation it is lifted from the 1972 movie. However in that production there were subtle differences in the main characters relationship and not-so-subtle differences in how they arrive where they are at the end. Had this edition of The Mechanic retained the entire ending it still might not have worked in light of other changes but at least it wouldnt feel as haphazard and artificial as if pieces of a puzzle are missing. The conclusion was the best part of the 1972 The Mechanic. Its one of the least satisfying aspects of the remake. Simon West is a capable action/thriller director (his previous credits include Tomb Raider) and his aptitude comes across in the way The Mechanic is assembled. It runs like a well-oiled machine without significant pauses for exposition or lags between high octane sequences. Meditations on whether revenge is an adequate motivation for murder are kept to quick sound bites. None of the action scenes are exceptionally unique or characterized by flashes of inspiration but they are competently choreographed and wont bore most viewers even those who have seen all these things before. The Mechanic seems designed as a vehicle for Statham and to that end it serves its purpose. It could have been more but the filmmakers were less interested in presenting an eclectic and challenging project with limited appeal than something loud and stripped-down that might capture a wider audience. By removing some of The Mechanics most tantalizing elements West and his coworkers have produced a motion picture that is appropriate for the January release date.

He appears in the occasional Guy Ritchie gangster head game but his genre of choice is the revved-up testosterone action film. The key to his charisma is that hes so much more cutthroat smart and elegant and so much more coolly British than an actor from the crash-cars-and-ask-questions-later school needs to be. With his shaved skull and handsome you-talkin-to-me stare hes like a Bruce Willis mad-dog avenger crossed with a more sociopathic James Bond. As Arthur Bishop the title character of The Mechanic Statham is playing one of those super-stealth hitmen who can sneak into the most protected of lairs and slip away moments later with the target dead. The opening swimming-pool assassination is just clever enough to set you up for a hitman version of a heist thriller. But then Stathams lone wolf is tricked into killing his longtime corporate associate (Donald Sutherland). Feeling used he tries to make up for his sin by taking Sutherlands son under his wing -- a dissipated rich boy played by Ben Foster who suggests a gnarled hillbilly Justin Timberlake. How do Statham and Foster team up in this movie? Simple Statham in about six minutes teaches Foster everything there is to learn about being a master assassin. Before long the apprentice is leaping off skyscrapers and wielding his weapon with fearless aplomb. The implausibility of The Mechanic even on its own genre-movie terms is jaw-dropping. Yet I might have forgiven that had the movie tried to involve us in some more elaborately sneaky contract murders. As it is The Mechanic is ham-fisted pulp like Robert Rodriguezs Machete taking itself seriously. Its enough to make you want to see Jason Statham take a break from B movies and become the A-list character actor he deserves to be.

The Mechanic Fair to good Director Simon West. Cast Jason Statham Ben Foster Donald Sutherland. Rating R for brutal violence language sex and nudity. Guide to this weeks new movie releases Bloody revenge movies Mechanic tries to rebuild style keep vibe of original Thats so 70s man. >> Guide to this weeks new releases In Simon Wests remake Jason Statham also pulls off complicated hits but he thinks about his actions ponders them even wants to talk about them when he gets an undesirable assignment. And then he kills the guy anyway. This is an action movie about hired killers after all. Its just interesting to note the different attitudes of the character first in 1972 and now nearly 40 years later. The existentialism and nihilism are mostly gone but the job remains the same. Thats not necessarily a bad thing. Movies are a product of their times. Jan Michael Vincent portrayed Bronsons eager apprentice in the original but to him killing was just an experience a happening. For Ben Foster who acts rings around Vincent (and most everyone else) its all about revenge. Statham plays Arthur Bishop the ""mechanic"" of the title. He works for Harry McKenna (Donald Sutherland). But when Harry is bumped off on the orders of a bigger boss Bishop becomes disillusioned. Adding to his feelings of confusion and betrayal is Steve McKenna (Foster) Harrys son. Though he and his father werent close Steve wants to avenge his death. For starters Harrys death is set up to look like a carjacking. So Steve figures hell go out at night and kill a few random carjackers the thinking being that eventually hell hit upon the right one. Interesting theory. Bishop intervenes and reluctantly takes Steve under his wing teaching him the tools and tricks of his trade. Their relationship is a mix of measured cool (Bishop) and to-hell-with-it self-destructiveness (Steve). Statham isnt exactly a chatty guy in any of his movies and that serves Bishop well. The action is entertaining enough and its kind of fun to follow the intricate plotting and planning of the jobs; Bishops first hit is particularly clever. The violence of course is off the charts. People dont just die they die OUT LOUD. But Statham is in his understated way a satisfying action star stoically going about his business. Foster is just a flat-out good actor as anyone who saw his work in ""The Messenger"" or ""310 to Yuma"" can attest. There are some twists and turns some telegraphed a little too strongly. As befits a remake theres not much new here and without giving too much away some of what is turns out to be disappointing. Still the slick glossy look and feel and the fast pace - the film is only 92 minutes long - make ""The Mechanic"" decent action fare if not a whole lot more than that.

TWITTER Director Simon Wests frantic style works against Jason Stathams cool brooding in the film co-starring Ben Foster. Even on a second try they cant get The Mechanic right. Silly and pandering where the 1972 original was pokey and short on style this updated hit man training film features the most annoyingly incoherent action cutting since Quantum of Solace and fails even on the most rudimentary level of creating a few iconic Jason Statham moments. Blowing an opportunity to at last inject some flair into the telling of original writer Lewis John Carlinos solid basic premise CBS Films and Millennium can anticipate okay returns from undemanding guy-movie audiences domestically with better results likely overseas. More in retrospect than at the time the first incarnation of The Mechanic enjoys a certain stature as one of the first pure American entries in the hired assassin sub-genre in addition to being a sort of warm-up for the Charles Bronson-Michael Winner teaming on the Death Wish movies that began two years later. But while Carlinos central conceit that of a master teaching his craft to the son of one of his victims is clever and possesses a measure of time-bomb tension the original suffers from a cant-be-bothered attitude toward visual expression. By contrast present director Simon West remains just as devoted to working in bold face and capital letters now as he did in his debut with Con Air 14 years ago albeit to considerably diminished returns. From the outset one senses the strain involved in coming up with more grandiose versions of parallel scenes in the original. Its a point of pride with highly paid lone wolf assassin Arthur Bishop to make his killings look like accidents. But the first job we see is preposterous on the face of it as he hides underwater at the bottom of a Colombian drug lords indoor swimming pool so that when the guy finally decides to take a dip Bishop can grab and drown him and hide his own hand even as armed goons surround the pool. Sorry this just doesnt seem like it would be any top killers preferred most reliable technique. Much of Richard Wenks redo of Carlinos more spare and realistic original betrays the same effort of trying to come up with something bigger badder and more sensational just for the sake of it nowhere moreso than in the pictures most violent scene Satisfied with the progress shown by his young protege Steve McKenna (Ben Foster) Bishop sends him to dispatch a rival assassin a huge gay man he knows will take a fancy to Steve. The resulting bloodbath is chaotically staged and cut in a way that subverts any sense of realism and wont convince anyone that Steve could actually get out of there alive. Like many action stars Statham is good at cool brooding but Wests frantic style works against this allowing no personal mood to seep in and preventing the actor from finding time or space of his own just to be. Foster supplies the expected edgy eccentricities to his unpredictable character but it mostly feels like window dressing. West is still working in 90s Bruckheimer factory style but without an overlay of ironic humor the act is now looking a little desperate. Whats left then is persistent pounding and pummeling a higher body count than the original and shreds of a promising existential story about a man whose profession appears to checkmate himself. As before that the anti-hero has a serious deeper side is indicated by his taste for classical music (here its Schuberts ""Trio in E-flat Op. 100"" familiar from the Barry Lyndon soundtrack) but Charles Bronson came off like an intellectual compared to what Statham is allowed to show. The film was mostly shot in unscenic areas around New Orleans. In a possibly unique circumstance this Chartoff Winkler and Nu Image production was partly produced by David Winkler and Bill Chartoff sons of the original producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff who are among the executive producers this time around.

Adapted from the 1972 Charles Bronson pic ""The Mechanic"" has been dusted off and retooled as a vehicle for brawny Jason Statham he of ""The Expendables"" and ""Transporter"" franchise. As directed by Simon West its something of a minimalist thriller -- one so light on plot that the narrative lurches with sporadic effectiveness from one fatal encounter to the next. While somewhat low-octane by todays action standards the mix of revenge elements and the Statham-Ben Foster relationship should keep audiences off-balance and moderately involved while generating more horsepower internationally than in its domestic ride. CBS Films has thus far mined a variety of genres in its commitment to midsized modestly budgeted fare. In essence this one is the equivalent of the ""B"" movies that flourished during the originals era -- and it proves middling and occasionally muddled on almost every level. Arthur Bishop (Statham) is introduced as he cleverly dispatches a well-guarded drug lord achieving the act via an elaborate caper worthy of ""Mission Impossible."" If executed properly he notes the trick is to carry out his assignments so ""nobody ever knows you were there."" Alas its a lonely soulless occupation and Arthurs only remotely human relationship is with mentor Harry (a classy cameo by Donald Sutherland). When circumstances lead to Harrys death Arthur grudgingly takes Harrys son Steve (Foster) under his wing agreeing to show the wayward kid the ropes of the hit-man game. Beyond the intricately planned hits though and the ingenuity that goes into those sequences the script credited to Richard Wenk and Lewis John Carlino (working from Carlinos original) doesnt exhibit much attention to detail. Nor does the story really begin to head anywhere until about halfway through -- long since it has become apparent the boss of the mysterious ""company"" that employs Arthur Dean (Tony Goldwyn) is probably not a very good guy. At that point what has been an unorthodox slow-moving action yarn becomes a more conventional shoot-em-up revenge tale after having raced through Steves apprenticeship and (in what might be the most suspenseful interlude) his first solo kill. Conveniently all this takes place in a shadowy world of amorality where the hit men dont seem quite as bad necessarily because pretty much everyone deserves to die. Set and shot in New Orleans the movie benefits from that bluesy atmosphere as well as an apparent absence of law enforcement inasmuch as bodies begin piling up with seldom a hint of pesky police intervention. Stathams voice seldom rises above a low rumble but hes well suited to these kind of taciturn killing-machine roles. Foster also brings menace to a character otherwise so thinly drawn that Arthur literally recites his resume to provide some clue as to what Steves all about. The most interesting side note incidentally might be the movies own family-business backstory with David Winkler and Bill Chartoff producing a remake based on a 39-year-old project brought to the screen by their fathers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff who are among the half-dozen executive producers credited. At a little over 90 minutes nobody will accuse director Simon Wests take on ""The Mechanic"" of overstaying its welcome; still more time in the shop to iron out the kinks and pacing would have been time well spent. As is the story idles then lurches into action rather like a polished-up old clunker in need of a comprehensive tuneup.

The same goes for this latest round of degeneracy - a remake of Michael Winners awful 1972 film - in which he plays a hitman (surprise) of such expert precision that he leaves no evidence of his kills. As in the original which starred Charles Bronson Arthur Bishop (Statham) is a skilful classical-music-loving superhuman contract killer hired by his boss to off old friend Harry (Donald Sutherland coasting). At which point Harrys young hitman-wannabe son Steve (Ben Foster not bad) enters the frame and pleads with Arthur to coach him in the ways of the modern assassin - unaware that Arthur is his fathers killer - and so we launch into an episodic spate of contrived and implausible hits. With its unrelenting violence and obligatory bonking sessions this is one for avid Stath fans only.

But despite that if youre a fan of Stath flicks youll be a fan of this. Sometimes you just need to watch Statham kick a man through a door and take out another 5 with a spoon. When you want that watch this Safe any of the Transporters Crank Wild Card etc etc.... Basically anything other Lock Stock and Snatch - the thinking mans Statham films.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreApr 27 2011EDFeaturedA slight improvement on DEATH RACE amp; the TRANSPORTER trilogy file this along with his safer movies like THE BANK JOB. Ben Foster brings an interesting dynamic to the plot as the apprentice hitman but besides that this is very predictable solid fare. Shame the script isnt too sharp. Off the point slightly but notice how eachtime Jase puts a record one it has a different sleeve and different coloutr label but it;s the same piece of music? Conitunuity or hes got a massive record colelction made up of one songHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 14 2011nidgebeeFeaturedWhat a great film.if you like statham its a must.Can`t believe some of the previous comments about this filmperhaps they were watching another film and got confused.Dont take their advice pop down and Vue it for yourself.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 10 2011scrumpyjackFeaturedCrisp non stop action and such nonsense. The best Stratham so far? Well yes but thats no deal breaker. Did I hold back a toilet trip as I didnt want to miss a poxy thing? Yep Relax you dont ALWAYS have to go along with the hipsters 6/10 (if it was French T.O would agree)Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 7 2011MarsellusFeaturedWatched this the other night because a friend and I turned up too late to watch The Fighter. I knew we would be disappointed - but I wasnt as utterly disappointed as I expected to be. First off this is one of Stathams best films. It has a better plot and is far less stupid than the Transporter films. Thats about it. Ben Foster is not bad in his young-psycho kind of role. The sex-scenes and romantic sub-plots go absolutely nowhere. Its about as good as the original - but that was shit as well.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 6 2011sangoFeaturedPut it simply... Not very good. They should have made it 18 certificate. More action shots would have made it good. Sex shots spoiled the film as it was so CRAP. ITS JUST A ANOTHER MURDER FILM WITH fight scenes RubbishHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 6 2011TRUTHTELLER.FeaturedThis is an excellent movie and is highly entertaining. Its no chick flick since its non stop action and pretty violent. The film has solid performances and really great and tight direction. Dan Collins should go look for a musical somewhere because this is a highly entertaining shoot em/blow m upmovie. You are also apparently an expert on what teenage boys in America do Danmaybe you should see someone about that. Think Bruce Willis. If you like Bruce youll like this movie. I was suprised when I entered the theatre to see so many people in there given the review but I know why now.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89396/the-mechanic.html,200,themechanic33,themechanic,timeout
