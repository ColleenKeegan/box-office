Grade B- ""Free Birds"" is a feathery goof - and I mean that as a compliment. Animated features have become such prestigious big-ticket items that theyre hardly ever antic. This cartoon is nothing but antic. Its about a couple of talking turkeys who hijack a secret U.S. government time capsule hurtle back to 1621 Plymouth and try to take turkey off the first Thanksgiving menu. Of course turkey wasnt on the Pilgrims original bill of fare; the colonists were celebrating a plentiful harvest not starving as they are here. The movie wisely starts with a disclaimer that nothing in it is factual - except the totally real talking turkeys. Get on board for that and theres fun to be had with this films grapeshot takedowns of (among other things) overheated telenovelas and nonsensical time-travel movies. Not that theres any internal logic to ""Free Birds"" either. Its fun to see a cartoon that does anything for a laugh but you wish the filmmakers had supplied some sturdier comic through-lines for their characters. Woody Harrelson plays a macho gobbler who considers it his destiny to save generations of turkeys from the hatchet. Although he starts the film with multiple memory and perception problems they appear to get ironed out en route to Plymouth. Happily he teams up well with Owen Wilson as a fearful scrawny bird who tires of warning his flock that theyre being raised for slaughter. Wilson and Harrelson make an infectiously absurd pair of buddies - like Walter Mitty meets Rooster Cogburn - especially after the delightfully airy Amy Poehler joins them in Plymouth as the princess in a tribe of wild birds who sport Indian war paint. The filmmakers sprinkle in several offhand lessons - for instance that holidays should be more about families coming together than eating - but nothing gets in the way of the overall daffiness. Although the humans are vile or desperate characters the action is almost all slapstick. Go in without expectations and youll have a pretty good time. Whenever director Jimmy Haywards invention flags he pulls some appealing gimmick out of his tail feathers like a riff on clones or the early colonial introduction of dough cheese and tomato sauce.

The movies animal rights vegetarian message should go down easily with politically correct parents - at least until they choke on the offensive depiction of 17th-century turkeys as face-painted headband-wearing native Americans. Celebrity Celebrity photos of the week Blasts from the past The entire movie written by Kevin Smiths producing partner Scott Mosier and director Jimmy Hayward (Horton Hears a Who) is well-intended but maladroit with a clever premise and cute animation that are undermined by the trite sci-fi parody plot and manic unfunny banter.Owen Wilson provides the voice of Reggie a smart misfit bird who cant get his fellow turkeys beaks out of the corn long to acknowledge their imminent execution. But when hes picked by the U.S. presidents daughter as the official White House-pardoned turkey Reggie turns from prophet to sybarite at his rustic Camp David cabin gobbling delivery pizzas and Mexican soap operas.The easy life ends when hes kidnapped by Jake (Woody Harrelson) the zealous dopey leader of the Turkey Liberation Front who persuades Reggie to help hijack the governments top-secret egg-shaped time machine (robot voiced by George Takei) and go back to Plymouth Colony in 1621 to reset the holiday meal.The movies action-crammed second half drops pointless references to Braveheart to Pocahontas (with Amy Poehler as the Chief Broadbeaks daughter Jenny) but beyond giving kids second thoughts about fighting for the drumsticks theres little reason to be thankful for this undercooked over-stuffed effort.

Photo AP MOVIE REVIEW Free Birds Running time 91 minutes. Rated PG (some disturbing images). At the Lincoln Square the Empire others. Is Hollywood scheming to turn your little ones into strident vegetarians? Could be but I wish theyd do it with material more inspired than ""Free Birds"" a forgettable -- and occasionally borderline offensive -- animated tale of turkeys trying to take back Thanksgiving. Reggie (Owen Wilson) has always been ahead of the flock ""Im not going to dress it up"" he says. ""Turkeys are dumb."" Still he tries in vain to warn his vapid relatives about the upcoming November carnage and in the process ends up with a presidential pardon. Just as hes settling into a life of ease at Camp David Reggies recruited by barrel-chested turkey activist Jake (Woody Harrelson) who needs his help to steal the governments time machine (voiced by the silken-toned George Takei) to travel back to the first Thanksgiving and get their brethren off the menu for good. There they meet a comely bird named Jenny (Amy Poehler) whos wild-turkey royalty; her tribe is depicted as some sort of weird parallel to Native Americans especially when they paint horizontal lines on their cheeks and chant as theyre preparing to go to war against poultryeating humans. Given that actual Native Americans also eventually show up its a head-scratching move; given Reggies earlier crack about turkey intelligence it seems just plain ill-advised. More thought-provoking is Jakes description of his childhood in a factory farm depicted as a nightmarish gray prison full of miserable obese birds. It ought to have some kids asking questions about the provenance of their upcoming T-day dinner -- not a bad thing -- though it may also be upsetting for younger ones as will the scene of a bloodthirsty turkey hunt undertaken by a ""Deadwood""-like pilgrim posse. No animated movie is allowed to be 2-D these days but ""Free Birds"" makes decent use of its three dimensions especially during a puffed-up turkey wattle fight between showboating toms and with little round fluffball chicks tailor-made for mass marketing. Still the characters bouncy-ball cuteness isnt enough to make up for recurring tasteless moments. Director Jimmy Haywards (""Horton Hears a Who"" and ""Jonah Hex"") affinity for cringey retro humor is reinforced when one Native American weighs in on anchovy pizza ""Tastes like dirty sock. Still better than my wifes cooking am I right?"" Because nobody benefits from hoary stereotypes more than kids am I right?

""Free Birds"" the animated family film of the current holiday features the voices of Owen Wilson Woody Harrelson and Amy Poehler. Photo Relativity Media Free Birds review What cheesy product placement 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Free Birds Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Owen Wilson Amy Poehler and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Jimmy Hayward. (PG. 90 minutes.) Weve seen some audacious product placement in movies before Joe Pesci ordering a Subway sandwich in ""Lethal Weapon 2""; Tom Hanks giving AOL stock a boost in ""Youve Got Mail""; a 119-minute Google advertisement disguised as a feature film called ""The Internship."" But movie audiences have never been sucker-punched by the fist of embedded marketing with the force that we see at the end of ""Free Birds."" Warning After a four-paragraph grace period this review will include a spoiler of the final scene of the movie. And this spoiler (the contents not the revealed plot points) may ruin your day. ""Free Birds"" is the kind of factory-churned animated movie that seems to be multiplying in recent years. It sounds fun and clever in theory featuring a turkey named Reggie who is pardoned by the president then travels back in time to thwart the first Thanksgiving meal presumably saving his species from centuries of slaughter. In execution the film is all sidekicks and sight gags with little story cohesion or purpose. Example Most of ""Free Birds"" takes place after the first year the Pilgrims landed but theres a turkey who sounds like the Taco Bell Chihuahua. Because why? Did Hollywood kid-movie focus-group guidelines deem that a fast-talking Latin-accented character must be included regardless of whether it follows chronological or geographic logic? But thats barely a blip on the horrendousness radar when considering the resolution of ""Free Birds."" Spoilers arrive in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... The first Thanksgiving meal is saved the pilgrims are spared from starvation and peace is achieved between Indians and the settlers. All because a delivery boy from the future arrives bearing boxes of Chuck E. Cheeses pizza. That is what were supposed to accept as a happy ending in ""Free Birds"" Chuck E. Cheese saves America. And following the movies logic every Thanksgiving dinner in the nearly 400 years since has been a turkey-free atrocity consisting of a feast of cardboard-tasting pizza. Cue the uplifting music. End credits. The rage might have been tempered a little if the delivery boy also brought Skee ball a Ms. Pac-Man machine and an animatronic band of vermin programmed ironically to sing Arcade Fire songs. But no. Just the pizza. One of the more pivotal meals in human history rewritten to include one of the worst foods. Great job Reel FX Animation. Looking forward to a cartoon reworking of the Last Supper with catering from the Olive Garden. (Make sure Jesus samples the Crispy Risotto Bites.) Beyond this hideousness ""Free Birds"" is a forgettably mediocre family film. It skews darker than necessary with the pilgrims alternately portrayed as pointlessly savage or vulnerable depending on the plots needs. The writers do contribute some clever moments in the beginning and director Jimmy Hayward rewards short attention spans with a brisk pace. While this film may be spoiled from serious cultural consideration by the unfortunate product placement its definitely not the Chuck E. Cheese of animated family films. ""Enough with Chuck E. Cheese-bashing snob"" you say. ""Its just a kids movie"" Fine. Then you should do this Instead of the deep-fried turkey mashed potatoes delicious canned cranberry cylinder and Aunt Alices homemade stuffing surprise your family on Nov. 25 with some Chuck E.

Credit Relativity Media Some animated films like ""My Neighbor Totoro"" seem nonsensical because they replicate the strange logic of a childs imagination. Others make little sense because the concept is inane and the execution is manic and unoriginal. ""Free Birds"" the new cartoon about time-traveling turkeys is the second kind.Owen Wilson lends his voice to Reggie a purple-plumed free-range turkey who is smart skinny and self-serving. The casting director should be commended for uniting Mr. Wilson with Woody Harrelson in an animated buddy comedy. Yet while Mr. Harrelson is successful precisely because he disappears into the role of the dimwitted and fearless turkey named Jake Mr. Wilson plays a stifled caricature of his persona from his live-action films. The script even recycles a joke from his role in ""Zoolander."" And worse little else in the film is funny.The plot follows the turkeys as they travel back in time to alter the first Thanksgiving menu. It is quite accurately I think as if someone said ""Lets make Bill amp; Teds Excellent Adventure starring turkeys"" Some of the same visuals and plot points from that 1980s classic are copied here without any of its inventiveness and singular tone. It takes a certain brilliance to do dumb well but the makers of ""Free Birds"" have not displayed this quality.Instead the film is stuffed with violence. Some children may be frightened by scenes involving horror-style attack dogs relentless fighting and even the love interests lazy eye. Most disappointing is that the 3-D animation is smooth but visually uninteresting in this first feature from Reel FX an animation studio with a track record in commercials.The movies pro-vegetarian pro-fast-food message is nutritionally dubious -- and notably sponsored by Chuck E. Cheeses. (This might be a good occasion to explain to your child what ""product placement"" means.) The movie subversively suggests not only that we should avoid the traditional foods at Thanksgiving but also that we should have that meal delivered. Never has a holiday film seemed to hate the values of the event its celebrating so much. In the end as after a junk food binge ""Free Birds"" is likely to leave audiences fuzzy-headed and vaguely nauseated instead of nourished and satisfied.""Free Birds"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some action/peril rude humor and exploding waddles.

"Review Free Birds lays an egg - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Free Birds lays an egg Review Free Birds lays an egg Relativity Media Relativity Media Reggie (voiced by Owen Wilson) and Jake (Woody Harrelson) in ""Free Birds."" Reggie (voiced by Owen Wilson) and Jake (Woody Harrelson) in ""Free Birds."" (Relativity Media Relativity Media) Sheri Linden ""Free Birds"" is an odd duck. The animated feature has a nifty premise time-traveling turkeys for starters. Theyre critters on a mission as one would assume their goal nothing less than rewriting American culinary history -- and the fate of their species -- by changing the main course at the first Thanksgiving. Owen Wilson Woody Harrelson and Amy Poehler contribute spirited voice work and the movie renders the Plymouth Colony in a rich autumn palette. But like the ungainly avian creatures at the center of the herky-jerky adventure this toon seldom gets off the ground.With its flat punch lines formulaic action and undercooked melange of messages -- touching on everything from factory farming to genocide -- the film waddles awkwardly. Kids will enjoy the slapstick and overlook the moldy jokes; grown-ups will be slightly amused bored or mildly offended depending on how much energy they choose to invest in the experience. The first feature from Dallas-based animation house Reel FX ""Free Birds"" isnt destined to become a holiday tradition. It is however crafted with expressive characters (who gain nothing from the needless 3-D).PHOTOS Fall movie sneaks 2013 Wilson is dependably anxious and engaging as Reggie a free-range bird whose IQ is off the turkey meter. Understanding whats in store for his corn-fattened flock as Thanksgiving nears he tries to instigate an uprising. It would be a feat just to raise the consciousness of his domesticated doomed brethren who are grateful to be fed and dont want to mess up a good thing.Reggie goes a little brain-dead himself settling in for some pampered downtime at Camp David when he becomes the United States official pardoned turkey. He discovers the wonders of delivery pizza and telenovelas identifying with one shows lone-wolf hero. Its a given that hell learn the errors of his loner ways. Juggling themes the screenplay by Scott Mosier and director Jimmy Hayward revolves around a familiar trope An outsider finds his place in the world.Toward that end Reggie is forcibly recruited by turkey freedom fighter Jake (voiced by vocal vegan Harrelson) for a trip to 1621 Massachusetts where he falls for Jenny (Poehler) one of the smart wild turkeys unspoiled by modern life. The devolution from the 17th century tough birds wisdom and hard work to the dimwitted inertia of Reggies contemporaries is one of several dark undertows to the goofy-earnest proceedings. Theres also the prison-like terrors of an industrial farm and the disconcerting parallel between American Indians and the persecuted Plymouth turkeys with their tribal face paint and rituals. Its an unwieldy mix. The recipes proportions are off -- at the least the vegetarian messaging would be more palatable without the Chuck E. Cheese product placement.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TV As good as Wilson and Harrelson are the buddy shtick doesnt click. Hayward (""Horton Hears a Who"") does get some comic traction however broad from the competitive posturing between Jake and another alpha turkey. Colm Meaneys somewhat deranged Myles Standish and George Takeis wry talking space capsule lend some shadings.But shadings are little consolation when the gags refuse to take flight. Late in the movie a gleeful sendup of time-travel logic suggests the gratifying comic meal that ""Free Birds"" might have been if it had less on its plate.calendarlatimes.com----------------------Free BirdsMPAA rating PG for some action/peril and rude humor.Running time 1 hour 31 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Animation (Movie Genre) Movies Entertainment Thanksgiving Reviews Woody Harrelson Travel On the Set Movies and TV Review Enders Game captures the now in its futuristic tale Review Naomi Watts is extraordinary in the flawed Diana Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-free-birds-20131101,0,4113856.story#axzz2jEyeTTsa",200,freebirds7,freebirds,latimes

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Jake (voiced by Woody Harrelson) left Reggie (Owen Wilson) and Jenny (Amy Poehler) attempt to turn back the clock on Thanksgiving in ""Free Birds."" (Courtesy of Relativity Media) By Stephanie Merry October 31 2013 Follow stephmerry Finally theres a movie vegetarian parents can enjoy with their impressionable offspring. The animated adventure ""Free Birds"" follows a couple of modern-day turkeys who travel back in time to the first Thanksgiving and try to alter history thus saving their brethren for generations to come. With some help from the vocal gifts of Woody Harrelson Amy Poehler and to a lesser extent Owen Wilson the comedy offers even poultry fans a few pleasures. Reggie (Wilson) is a turkey misfit on his free-range farm. Not only does he look different with his cornflower blue head and slender frame but he seems to have a modicum of smarts which his inbred cohabitants seriously lack. The dimwitted birds think the man with the axe is their friend and that Reggies farm-to-table prognostications are the delusions of a misinformed muckraker. Reggie manages to escape his basted fate thanks to a presidential pardon but just as he settles in at Camp David and learns about the pleasures of pizza and fuzzy slippers hes kidnapped by a turkey who talks like an Army sergeant and looks like the wattled version of a CrossFit devotee. Jake (Harrelson) has some crazy tales of his own A mystical being directed him to kidnap Reggie and go back in time to stop the Pilgrims and Native Americans from feasting on the birds forebears. His ravings turn out to be logical too and the pair manage to get to the 17th century where they join a band of wild turkeys -- who happen to be much shrewder than contemporary birds -- and prepare to wage war on the hunters. Catering to both children and their chaperones is a precarious balance. ""Free Birds"" has the colorful palette zippy action and silly story to keep kids giggling but it also delivers a few worthwhile winks to parents. The presidents daughter for example is a narcoleptic pinball who knows way too much about whats going on around her and isnt afraid to share her feelings about ""the girl who likes [her] daddy."" Jake and one of the wild turkeys another alpha male get into an entertaining battle of one-upmanship. And George Takei delivers laughs as the artificially uber-intelligent time machine. But given the heights of the genre ""Free Birds"" at times feels derivative. Jake has a short-term memory problem thats reminiscent of Dory in ""Finding Nemo"" and one of the wild turkeys Jenny (Poehler) has a lazy eye that seems like a cheap bid for quirky individualism. And while the wild turkey chicks are so adorable it hurts a little they also look exactly like earless Furbys. (The popularity of the Minions from ""Despicable Me"" may have ensured that future animated features all contain cute cohorts.) Will ""Free Birds"" have kids opting for tofurkey come Nov. 28? Probably not. But in the meantime it delivers a nice helping of generation-spanning entertainment.   1/2 PG. At area theaters. Contains action and rude humor. 91 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"Free Birds 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Free Birds 2 stars Free BirdsGannett Relativity Media SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED VIDEO ""Free Birds"" trailer By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Oct 31 2013 1144 AM ""Free Birds"" is an undistinguished little movie the would-be cute telling of how a couple of turkeys try to get their kind off the Thanksgiving menu. Note ""would-be cute."" It isnt cute. It isnt really funny. It just kind of is. Actually the first 10 or 15 minutes arent bad. We meet Reggie (Owen Wilson) who tells us up front that turkeys are stupid birds. But hes different. He realizes there is a bigger world out there and that turkeys are meant to be dinner in it. His warnings go unheeded until he wins the turkey version of the lottery He is the chosen turkey in the presidents annual pardoning. So Reggie becomes the Camp David pet of the presidents daughter (Kaitlyn Maher) whose most distinguishing characteristic appears to be narcolepsy. (Maybe its a self-critique on the filmmakers part.) Reggie enjoys the good life watching TV movies and ordering delivery pizza. Then one night Jake (Woody Harrelson) kidnaps him and in effect the movie goes kind of screwy from there. It seems the Great Turkey appeared to Jake in a vision and told him to find a time machine on the grounds of Camp David. Thus begins a time-travel adventure in which Jake and a reluctant Reggie go back in time to a couple of days before the first Thanksgiving where they intend to change history by preventing their ancestors from being served up as the main course. It wont be easy. Director Jimmy Hayward who also co-wrote the screenplay sets up the turkeys as a clumsy metaphor for Native Americans mistreated by the new settlers. (Having the turkeys wear headdresses and war paint is probably the first clue.) On the run from the brutal Miles Standish (Colm Meany) theyve gone underground under the leadership of Chief Broadbeak (Keith David) whose daughter Jenny (Amy Poehler) catches Reggies eye. Its all bright and colorful and the pictures move so if youre 3 years old this is probably a decent time at the movies. For everyone else maybe not so much. Its not the actors -- Wilson is his good-natured slacker self while Harrelsons Jake is a big-talking dope. Poehler is probably the best thing about the movie. And George Takei has some fun as the voice of the time machine. But theres nothing inspired about the movie. Maybe weve become spoiled by animated fare in the wake of Pixars earlier triumphs. Or maybe the writing just isnt up to snuff. Whatever the case the folks behind ""Free Birds"" are trying to entertain us. But they rarely succeed.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com FREE BIRDS Share Comment When it comes to Thanksgiving-themed screen entertainment families have never been looking at a feast exactly. More like slim pickings. ""A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving"" is always a kick but weve seen it so many times that we know Snoopys toast-and-jellybeans menu by heart. ""Miracle on 34th Street"" has its Macys Parade scenes but including it on a Turkey Day list is obviously just glomming onto Christmass cheer. All of which makes the 3-D animated romp ""Free Birds"" a welcome foray into underexploited territory conceptually at least. Cartoon turkeys who go time traveling to get their species off the holiday menu? Sounds fun. Of course if director Jimmy Hayward (""Horton Hears a Who"") could have given us a little story development beyond just the premise that would have been nice too.

Free Birds a turkey of a movie review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFree Birds a turkey of a movie reviewUnfunny Free Birds tries to milk Thanksgiving for seasonal laughs. By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Oct. 31 2013Free BirdsStarring the voices of Owen Wilson Woody Harrelson Amy Poehler and George Takei. Directed by Jimmy Hayward. 91 minutes. Opening Nov. 1 at major theatres. GAre we seen by some filmmakers as popcorn-munching saps content to occupy our eyeballs with anything animated that features the voices of movie and TV stars?Hence Free Birds a seasonally pegged 3D cartoon bore that sets the bar so low it could give a slug a concussion.Article Continued BelowCo-written and directed by Jimmy Hayward (Jonah Hex Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who) Free Birds is a pallid imitation of 2000s superb self-preservation satire Chicken Run.The premise -- that modern turkeys travel back in time to the first Thanksgiving to get their kind off the menu -- is a one-line pitch spun into a 90-minute movie aided by more soggy stuffing than the contents of a Butterball. Scawny and self-aware turkey Reggie (Owen Wilson) has tired of trying to persuade his barnyard flock their Thanksgiving invitation will have permanent results. He gets a stay of execution as the recipient of the official presidential turkey pardon from a square-jawed Bill Clinton sound-alike.Reggie snuggles in for the good life of pizza (cue the product placement for Chuck E. Cheeses) and TV at Camp David. But his good time ends when muscle-bound birdbrained turkey Jake (Woody Harrelson) arrives to haul Reggie off on a mission to travel back in time to the first Thanksgiving to save the worlds turkeys.This is about the point where parents need to think up a very good story for why turkey still plays a central role on many holiday tables while silently giving gratitude that Canadian Thanksgiving was a month ago. Free Birds will have been forgotten by next week let alone next year.A trip in a hijacked top-secret government time machine (a wisecracking egg-shaped contraption voiced by Star Treks George Takei the best part of Free Birds) dumps Reggie and Jake in 1621 New England just as the first Thanksgiving is about to commence.Nasty Englishman Myles Standish (Colm Meaney acting more like Snidely Whiplash than Longfellows romantic fellow) leads the hunting party from the pilgrims fort to top up the larder for the feast. Hes hardly successful. Reggie discovers old-time turkeys were a lot more resourceful than the layabout modern gobblers he knows. Eluding hunters is a turkey trot for them.His lessons about the ways of turkeys past come via Jenny (Amy Poehler) a supersmart pretty bird and potential love interest. Shes the daughter of scowling Chief Broadbeak (Keith David) and sister of Jakes rival Ranger (director Hayward who has at least five onscreen voice roles).Kids will coo over the baby turkeys pastel fluffballs that have Tribble-like effects on Jake. But whats with the Its the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown ripoff?A final battle of turkeys versus pilgrims is the kind of manic ultra-busy explosion-filled effort that is the preferred way to wrap up a kids movie if a huge song-and-dance production number isnt available.With jokes that focus mainly on Jake clenching his buttocks (plus one scowling Native American in a feathered headdress commenting on angry birds) humour is mostly off the menu for Free Birds.As for the big question of what should replace turkey at Thanksgiving the fast-food solution the flick proposes is one parents wont be thankful for either.Read more about ThanksgivingThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Area theaters. Most minor animated movies are so rote that its worth acknowledging a strange bird like this cheerfully gonzo kid flick. Its no masterpiece but if youre hoping for a family film that will keep everyone reasonably entertained this will fly. Owen Wilson deserves much of the credit thanks to his nimble delivery as Reggie the only intelligent turkey on his farm. While the rest of his flock is as dumb as stuffing a panicked Reggie realizes theyre all being fattened up for a feast. But before he can hit somebodys Thanksgiving table hes whisked into a photo op to be officially freed by the President. Much to his delight he gets his own room at Camp David along with cable and all the pizza he can eat. Alas his paradise is ruined when another bird named Jake (Woody Harrelson) kidnaps him. Jake is on a mission to save turkeykind by traveling back to the 17th century in a talking time machine (dryly voiced by George Takei) to redefine Thanksgiving. Jakes plan is to convince the pilgrims and Native Americans that a vegetarian celebration would be ideal. Unfortunately the vicious Myles Standish (Colm Meaney) firmly believes otherwise. So Jake and Reggie have to save their fellow fowl including a cute turkey named Jenny (Amy Poehler) before the Big Day. Between the cheap-looking animation (skip the 3-D ticket) and simplistic plotting no ones going to mistake this modest effort for a Pixar project. But its a nice surprise to realize that the script does have higher aspirations. Reggie (Owen Wilson) and Jake (Woody Harrelson) go back in time in Free Birds. The one-liners are intermittently sharp and unexpectedly offbeat. And the voice cast ably connects with Haywards slightly skewed sensibility which goes a long way when the action starts to falter. After an amusingly weird first half things take a serious turn toward the end with an unnecessarily violent ""Braveheart""-style battle. Haywards handling of the Native Americans plight -- which seems to be represented by the turkeys -- also feels misguided. Children of course wont notice the political subtext. But do be prepared for them to exit the theater demanding that you make only Tofurkey in the future. On a mobile device? Click here to watch video.

Share Tweet In one of the best bits on his breakthrough album Werewolves amp; Lollipops Patton Oswalt describes the punch-up process on computer-animated films as thinking up ""funny jokes that people offscreen can yell over the unfunny uninteresting action to make it a comedy."" That succinctly sums up the experience of watching Free Birds. The best moments are jokes that feel grafted onto a film that was probably close to completion before anyone involved realized they were portraying a fight between turkeys and English settlers as the largest conflict in the European colonization of North America. Reggie (Owen Wilson) the only turkey on his farm to realize that his brethren are bred for the Thanksgiving dinner table becomes the ceremonial bird pardoned by the president of the United States. He lives a charmed life--accompanying the presidents exposition-spouting daughter kicking back and enjoying telenovela marathons--until Jake (Woody Harrelson) an escaped factory-raised turkey kidnaps Reggie to find a secret government time machine. Jakes plan go back to the first Thanksgiving and ""get turkeys off the menu."" Once in colonial times the two birds team up with the underground--tribal wild turkeys led by Jenny (Amy Poehler) yet another love interest for Wilson to stammer at. The film operates under a ""dont ask questions"" mentality with respect to time-travel paradoxes talking animals and American history. No humans can understand the turkey gobble language but Secret Service agents dont bat an eye when one struts down the hall in slippers to pick up a pizza. Jakes plan would eliminate the economic impetus for turkey farming throwing their own existence into question. And the gaggle of wild turkeys has among its members a wholly unnecessary Latino stereotype. When they get lines worth selling Poehler and Harrelson earn their paychecks as the leader-in-waiting and lunkheaded brute respectively. And George Takei has some trifling fun as the voice of the time machine. But Free Birds doesnt just obliterate any semblance of historical sensitivity in its effort to stake a claim on rarely attempted holiday films. (See also 2011s Easter-themed Hop.) It equates turkeys--birds repeatedly referred to as dumb and incapable of fighting for their own lives--to Native Americans. In doing so the film marginalizes the role that culture played in bringing turkeys into the colonial ecosystem while ignoring that the natives were also hunting and killing the birds and thus were not exactly allies in the struggle against the colonists. Director Jimmy Hayward started his career on the computer-animated television series ReBoot and worked as an animator on the first five Pixar features. Outside of the nurturing confines of that studio however Haywards directorial efforts--Horton Hears A Who and Jonah Hex--have been increasingly troubling. Helming a film that reframes the colonial Thanksgiving myth with egregious product placement (for Chuck E. Cheeses notoriously terrible pizza no less) shows mocking contempt for an audience assumed to be as lazy as the unquestioning farm turkeys.

It features the voices of Owen Wilson Amy Poehler and Woody Harrelson. VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT October 30 2013This animated comedy with a soft spot for turkeys and a tendency toward revisionist history is moderately entertaining albeit forgettable holiday fare.Reggie (Owen Wilson) left and Jake (Woody Harrelson) are a pair of time-traveling turkeys in Free Birds.(Photo Relativity Media)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourStars Owen Wilson Woody Harrelson Amy Poehler George TakeiRated PG; Runtime 1 hour 31 minutes; opens Friday nationwideApparently these birds you can change.Unlike the Lynyrd Skynyrd song Free Birds (1/2 out four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) is all about revisionism -- at least from the point of view of a pair of animated turkeys.What theyre looking to alter is Thanksgiving or more specifically the traditional role of the turkey in the holiday celebration.Like the song these birds must be traveling on. Their journey involves going back in time to just before the legendary first Thanksgiving in Plymouth Mass. The goal is to switch up the feast so that turkey is not on the menu.The 3-D animated film the first of the holiday entries is likable and amusing if slight.FIRST LOOK Time-traveling turkeys take on Thanksgiving in Free BirdsREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersReggie is a scrawny gobbler affably voiced by Owen Wilson. He spends his days on a farm surrounded by his own kind though theyre dimmer and less snarky. When selected for slaughter they think theyre going to ""turkey paradise.""Reggie has been trying to tell them that Thanksgiving means carnage but no one listens. Just as they begin to get the picture Reggie gets whisked away by the president of the United States in his annual ceremonial turkey pardoning. Actually its the enthusiastic young first daughter (Kaitlyn Maher) who selects Reggie and drags him onto Air Force One.Soon the bird is living in luxury at Camp David where he develops a taste for pizza and telenovelas.While this may sound forced its actually fairly inventive and funny.Shortly after Reggie settles into his cushy life hes spirited away by a determined -- and remarkably buff -- turkey named Jake (Woody Harrelson). Jake proclaims that the Great Turkey urged him to board a time machine go back to 17th-century Plymouth Colony and stop early settlers from serving up turkey as an expression of gratitude. Somehow his prophecy included Reggie.Conjuring up The Great Turkey is no doubt meant to draw a connection between this and Charlie Browns Great Pumpkin. Or else its not a very imaginative moniker.Initially resistant Reggie eventually joins forces with Jake. His zeal for the mission is spurred on by his attraction to Jenny (Amy Poehler) a friendly female turkey who lives in a gaggle of birds whose lives are threatened by zealous turkey-hunting Myles Standish (Colm Meaney). This real-life historical figure is rather inexplicably woven into this tall tale of turkey triumph.According to this telling colonial turkeys were no empty-headed flappers. Reggie is drawn to these wiser more resourceful precursors who possess a sense of community and focus on young hatchlings.Director Jimmy Hayward is on double duty pulling off a few amusing voices including the president (who sounds astoundingly like Bill Clinton). George Takei gives humorous voice to S.T.E.V.E the time machine.Some jokes are aimed intentionally over the heads of kids. And the story is overlong and has an unnecessarily violent climax.The historical mash-up could confuse young viewers. Its message could turn impressionable children into traumatized vegans -- or at least inspire them to pass on the big bird and head straight for pie.But Free Birds is pleasant enough holiday fare. And kudos to the animators for transforming a rather unattractive -- or at least unappreciated -- species into a cast of endearing characters. 174 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1bDISEe",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/10/30/free-birds-review/2941277/,200,freebirds15,freebirds,usatoday

(Reel FX/Relativity Media) C Free Birds Genre Animation Comedy; Starring Woody Harrelson Amy Poehler Owen Wilson; Director Jimmy Hayward; Release Date Wide 11/01/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 91; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Relativity Media Posted November 7 2013 -- 1200 AM EST The good news The talking turkeys in Free Birds are so unappealing and unfunny that your kids will probably feel guilt-free eating their real-life counterparts this Thanksgiving. The bad news You might have to sit through Free Birds. In the first feature by Dallas-based animation studio Reel FX two very different gobblers join forces to travel back in time to circa 1621 -- the date of the first Thanksgiving feast -- in an effort to take poultry off the menu. Reggie (Owen Wilson) is the only turkey on his farm smart enough to know his days are numbered come November. Luckily for him hes saved from an undignified death when hes pardoned by the president of the United States and flown to Camp David where hes treated to a life of unlimited pizza and cable TV -- until hes kidnapped by a cocky meathead of a turkey named Jake (Woody Harrelson) who pulls him into a scheme to hijack a top-secret government time machine that whisks them back to the era of the early settlers. There Reggie and Jake help a comely she-turkey Jenny (Amy Poehler) and her feathered tribe battle an evil game hunter intent on feeding them to a group of hungry colonists and their Native American ""friends."" This is where a ridiculous potentially amusing premise devolves into a series of hurried (and vaguely offensive) natives-against-musket-wielding-intruders tropes (the 17th-century turkeys even live in a Home Tree of sorts a la Avatar). Often you can point to a middling animated films visuals as its saving grace. But this colonial world which should feel like an expansive autumnal panorama feels oddly inert and two-dimensional. In the end the jokes simply aren?t funny enough to lift these flight-challenged fowl off the ground.

This is a deeply incorrect assumption. ""Free Birds"" is delightfully strange the cinematic equivalent of a holiday potluck packed with the delicious and the inspired coexisting peacefully next to the distasteful and the weird. It is at the very least unexpectedly satisfying. Shunned by his flock of bird-brained turkeys smart cookie Reggie (voice by Owen Wilson) all but accidentally becomes the presidents pardoned turkey thanks to a literal shove out the henhouse door by his supposed family and the presidents own overeager (though possibly narcoleptic) daughter. As the pardoned turkey Reggie takes up residence at Camp David - literally inside the main house - where he spends his days ordering copious amount of pizza delivery and watching brain-rotting telenovelas that he relates to in increasingly more alienating ways (his favorite is about a cast-out orphan who sees himself as a ""solo lobo""). What Reggie really wants (of course) is to be a part of a flock even if that means letting go of his self-styling as his own ""solo lobo"" and so the appearance of the buff and bizarre Jake (voiced by Woody Harrelson) may come as a surprise to Reggie but not to the audience (little about the films plotting should come as any shock actually). Jakes sudden appearance in Reggies life is just the start of a personal quest - egged on by ""The Great Turkey"" a spectral being who appeared to a young Jake the nutty turkey believes he and Reggie are destined to go back in time to the first Thanksgiving to take turkey off the menu. And yes its very convenient that the U.S. government is just about to test a new time machine in the vicinity of Camp David (though perhaps not as convenient as we may initially suspect). While the time travel mechanics of the film are quite questionable - a third act reveal about how it works is actually somewhat smart even though its presented in a very confusing manner thats best left unexamined lest audiences bend their brain into shapes theyll never untangle - it gets the job done and includes the vocal stylings of the very funny George Takei as the actual egg-shaped device that lands the two turkeys back in the seventeenth century. Once in Plymouth Rock the pair encounters both native turkeys and interloping humans and the battle to remove turkey from the menu for good begins. The films styling of the past turkeys as Urban Outfitters versions of Native Americans (theyve got feathers in their hair - uh their feathers? - and war paint on their faces) is an uncomfortable turn but they are otherwise treated respectfully (yes were examining inappropriate cultural traits ascribed to animated turkeys). It doesnt hurt that the film makes a surprisingly understated choice in its second half thats pretty progressive when it comes to equal opportunity leadership (thanks to the work of the chiefs smart daughter Jenny as voiced by Amy Poehler). Unlike Reggie the past flock understands that their future lies with their family - especially their chirping jumping coterie of baby turkeys all of who resemble Furbies both strangely and adorably enough - but will Reggie be able to learn that lesson? And does Jake maybe already secretly know it based on a horribly traumatic event from his own chickhood? Oh come on you already know the answer. ""Free Birds"" obviously cribs from other works - the nods to ""Avatar"" of all things start early and keep on coming - but its so delightfully weird and bizarre that those elements are very nearly forgivable. The film is crammed with very strange and very amusing gags that have the sort of cross-generational appeal that plenty of other animated films aim for (in short can you take little ones to see the film and still be amused as an adult?) and it hits those marks with ease. (It is important to note however that the film is rated PG not G and its scenes of ""action/peril"" are certainly deserving of a tougher rating - this one is not for the littlest kids in your care.) ""Free Birds"" has plenty of jokes about butts but its also got clever little bits about modern culture (it gleefully pokes fun at cinematic tropes even while employing them) and it generally clucks right along thanks to it. The films style of animation makes all of the turkeys appear at turns adorable fuzzy charming proud and (stay with us here) just kind of buff while the humans look far more crude and poorly conceived by comparison a potentially incisive bit of commentary on their actions but one that ultimately comes off as fortuitous happenstance. Voicework suits Wilson especially when it comes to Reggie who seems like the exact sort of character Wilson would play in human form. Harrelson and Poehler both inject charm into their feathered counterparts and the recognizability of such talent goes a long way to up the adult appeal of this one. The gag of the production may wear thin over time but ""Free Birds"" is a more than worthy (and weird) holiday diversion for the whole family. Its turkey time. Gobble gobble.

There it will be presented on a platter its legs splayed in a most ungainly fashion -- lets hope its been spared the further indignity of those ruffled paper anklets -- before its flesh is torn to pieces and ingested by a gang of ravenous humans who will later fall asleep on the couch while watching football. Its the American way. We are after all a nation founded on bloodshed. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Free Birds an animated wingding from director Jimmy Hayward (Horton Hears a Who) offers a vision of a kinder gentler Thanksgiving. Reggie (voiced by Owen Wilson) is a young turkey with a higher-than-average IQ which means he knows his days are numbered. He casts a somber glance around the barnyard at his fellow future oven-stuffers and despairs over their stupidity They stare with delight at their own toes; their eyes gleam with gratitude when the farmer comes around with their daily ration of corn the better to fatten them with. But Reggie sees a way out when the President comes through town to pardon one lucky turkey. (As voiced by Hayward hes a Bill Clinton sound-alike with a cheerful corndog drawl.) Reggie is lucky enough to be the chosen bird and hes whisked off to Camp David where hes introduced to the pleasures of TV and pizza delivery. He even gets his own pair of fuzzy pink bunny slippers shuffling around the Presidential digs as if he owned the place.No turkey ever had it so good. But fate intervenes in the form of a bigger more ambitious turkey named Jake (Woody Harrelson) who urges the reluctant Reggie to travel back in time and alter mankinds holiday-eating habits. Via a giant talking space egg named S.T.E.V.E. (that stands for Space Time Exploration Vehicle Envoy and its voice belongs to George Takei) they whiz back to Plymouth circa 1621 where they try to destroy the gunpowder stash of Myles Standish (Colm Meaney) to keep turkeykind safe from his muskets. Their plan goes awry and theyre saved by a plucky girl-turkey named Jenny (Amy Poehler). She serves as Reggies love interest though shes also destined for great things within her own turkey tribe. Because these days its not enough for cartoon characters to just be cute; they need to be aspirational and inspirational as well.Film Details Free Birds RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time90 More Info Free Birds is so unhinged that it could almost work. It doesnt at least not after Reggie leaves the comfort of Camp David (and those fuzzy pink slippers) behind. Like so many modern animated features Free Birds packs too much in; the picture feels cramped and cluttered and despite its occasionally manic action it moves as slowly as a fattened bird waddling toward its doom.And theres another question Just how charismatic can an animated bird be Foghorn Leghorn and Tweety and Daffy notwithstanding? Peter Lord and Nick Park pulled off a small miracle with their 2000 Chicken Run a retelling of The Great Escape using chickens With their googly eyes and buck teeth their bodies shaped like ginger jars those capon crusaders had style to burn. The result was cockalorum pandemonium.Free Birds Reggie looks anemic in comparison He has Fozzie Bears haunches and a blue head perched on a slender rubbery neck. His expression is eager-to-please vaguely imbecilic -- he has none of the gung-ho determination of those Chicken Run gals. Jake is older more robust with a big macho brown torso but his personality is just as indistinct. It doesnt help that Hayward jams a sort-of robot army and dozens of nondescript 17th-century turkeys into his story.Reggie and Jake do change history persuading human beings -- in this case early settlers and Native Americans alike -- that theres something tastier than turkey flesh. Its a lovely idea -- all those turkeys lives spared But its doubtful Reggies 1621 triumph will change what shows up on most Americans Thanksgiving tables this year.

And then theres ""Free Birds"" which is sort of like that nondescript casserole your second cousin brings that winds up at the back of the table barely picked at and mostly ignored. A comedy that is not funny and an adventure that is not exciting ""Free Birds"" should be forgotten by the time Black Friday sales roll around. Owen Wilson lends his distinctly nasal voice to Reggie a turkey too smart for his own good. He figures out that he and his brethren are being fattened up (free-range style) for the kill but his fellow gobblers are perfectly happy to eat corn and talk about corn all day. When the other fowl figure out whats up they happily sacrifice outsider Reggie but its a stroke of luck since he gets chosen by the president (director Jimmy Hayward channeling Bill Clinton) to be the annual pardoned Thanksgiving turkey. Reggie settles in for a comfy life at Camp David having discovered pizza delivery and telenovelas but hes soon kidnapped by alpha turkey Jake (Woody Harrelson) for a vital mission Together the birds will hijack a secret government time machine (that speaks with the voice of George Takei) travel back to the first Thanksgiving and change the menu thus saving generations of turkeys from slaughter. Also read Woody Harrelson on Jimmy Kimmel I Was Hung Over at Free Birds Premiere Somehow they assume control of the time machine and arrive in 17th-century colonial America where they discover that their fore-turkeys are intelligent brave resourceful and in constant battle with vicious hunter Myles Standish (Colm Meaney). (""Free Birds"" is otherwise forgettable but its probably the only movie that will depict early settler Standish as looking like Al Swearengen from ""Deadwood."") Reggie becomes smitten with Jenny (Amy Poehler) the daughter of Chief Broadbeak (Keith David) and attempts to destroy the colonists weapons but things naturally go more than a bit awry. Even setting aside the films disregard for time-travel paradoxes and genocide metaphors -- trust me you dont want to wade into either of those -- ""Free Birds"" just isnt funny. For long stretches of the press screening the young kids in attendance laughed only sporadically at the broadest gags none of them having to do with Jakes repeated references to his glutes. Also read Fall Movie Preview Hunger Games Thor Shoot for Record-Breaking 2013 at the Box Office And why in a movie where youve already got characters from the present interacting with characters from the past would you have a 1620s turkey making high-five jokes? Strangest of all after loping along as a lame kiddie comedy ""Free Birds"" suddenly goes for unearned poignance with the death of a major character and a ""Braveheart""-inspired big battle sequence at the end. Its a 180-degree turn that even a good movie would have a tough time pulling off; here it just feels like screenwriters Hayward and Scott Mosier working from a story by David I. Stern and John J. Strauss were just throwing giblets at the wall to see what would stick. Thanksgiving deserves to have its own set of movies. But if theyre going to be at the level of ""Free Birds"" its time to start cinematically hibernating between Halloween and Christmas. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Month-old mashed potatoes wouldnt leave behind as questionable an aftertaste as ""Free Birds"" a well-animated but frankly misguided comedy about two turkeys who travel back in time to stop their species from becoming the official national dish of Thanksgiving. In drawing a parallel between these wild birds and 17th-century Native Americans this seemingly innocuous toon fantasy becomes another noxious-but-sanitized exercise in family-friendly cultural insensitivity. Kids wont care naturally but even viewers who dont mind (or dont pick up on) the unfortunate subtext wont be thrilled by the pictures bland storytelling and overly gabby gobblers. Even with an OK opening on the table holiday-perennial status looks unlikely for this fledgling feature effort from Dallas-based Reel FX.This story first appeared in the November 05 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Cribbing some narrative loop-de-loops from ""The Terminator"" and other time-travel adventures the screenplay by Scott Mosier and director Jimmy Hayward (from a story by producers David I. Stern and John J. Strauss) initially seems headed for agreeably daffy territory. Not unlike Remy in ""Ratatouille"" a movie to which ""Free Birds"" otherwise bears zero resemblance Reggie (voiced by Owen Wilson) is introduced as the storys animal-misfit protagonist a farm turkey of above-average intelligence who alone realizes the cruel fate that awaits his flock come November. But its a fate that Reggie manages to avoid when hes chosen by the U.S. president (Hayward channeling a young Bill Clinton) as that years ""pardoned turkey"" benefiting from a White House tradition that some believe dates back to the Lincoln administration. Soon Reggie is living it up at Camp David watching trashy telenovelas and eating delivery pizza only to be suddenly kidnapped by Jake (Woody Harrelson) a bigger tougher kookier bird who fancies himself a spy on a dangerous mission to rewrite history and make sure turkey never makes it onto the Thanksgiving Day menu. And so with the aid of an egg-shaped government-built time machine named Steve (amusingly voiced by George Takei) Reggie and Jake zip back to 1621 just as Plymouth Colony settlers are preparing to round up all the turkeys in the area in preparation for the Harvest Feast. As Reggie and Jake attempt to motivate the generally pacifist birds to fight for their lives ""Free Birds"" plays at least initially like a genial mashup of your average grade-school history lesson and freedom-fighter epics like ""Braveheart"" padded with an obligatory love story between Reggie and Jenny (Amy Poehler) daughter of the local turkey chief and building to a daring raid on the settlers weapons supply. It all feels fanciful yet familiar replete with all the trimmings of so many hard-working but undistinguished animated kidpics A-list actors delivering pushy in-your-face dialogue; dull romantic interludes; and a steady stream of action sequences meant to ensure maximum viewer engagement albeit with none of the sly intelligence or wit of a superior poultry-themed toon like ""Chicken Run."" All of which would make ""Free Birds"" a cute but disposable item were it not for the storys weird racial undertow From the turkeys face paint and feathered headbands to their tribal structure under the leadership of Chief Broadbeak (Keith David) the metaphor could scarcely be less subtle even with the token presence of actual Native Americans in the background. (Presumably these are members of the Wampanoag Nation although thats a matter for the films historical consultants to sort out.) The degree of offense taken will vary of course between those who see a toxic portrayal of Otherness and those whose reflexive attitude is ""Oh lighten up its only a kids movie."" And indeed in the long and inglorious tradition of animated stereotyping ""Free Birds"" is arguably less pernicious than say ""Dumbo"" insofar as it doesnt impute any ethnic mannerisms to the animals in question; it could even be argued that the film in sympathizing with the persecuted party has cleverly packaged Americas ugly legacy of oppression and genocide for kid-friendly consumption. Still the likening of a gravely mistreated ethnic group to a wild animal species cant help but strike an unwelcome note; even more off-putting at least from the standpoint of nutrition-concerned parents is the films cynical suggestion (spoiler alert) that fast food is somehow a preferable alternative to fresh poultry. For director/co-writer/voice actor Hayward (a longtime animator who previously directed 2008s ""Horton Hears a Who"" and 2010s live-action ""Jonah Hex"") ""Free Birds"" represents an obvious labor of love and given its genesis outside the studio system its an appreciably polished product. The use of 3D neither enhances nor detracts from the films pleasing autumn-hued look and the turkeys with their large eyes and diverse array of beaks and wattles are a nicely expressive bunch; the poults in particular which look like fluffy pastel-colored balls are pretty adorable.

Luke says November 3 2013 at 1122 am oh give me a break. lighten up this a childrens movie.... HORRIBLE review... claiming racial undertones made me read the review but finding out (just from your poor examples you stretched to make) it was nothing of the sort will make me be sure to never read this review site again Im truly sorry you feel this way about this movie.... such a cynical and angry way to go through life Reply sdf says November 13 2013 at 1026 pm http//tunemovie.com/movie-free-birds/3810.html Reply Aurther Murry says November 2 2013 at 1001 am Opinions are like belly buttons everyone had one. I found his review horrible and tried to make substance of something he has experienced. To me this is a very trivial review from someone who should not be in his line of work. Maybe he would do better being a politicians speech writer lots of word no substance. Reply C.P. says October 30 2013 at 135 am Wow Justin Chang is really reaching if he sees anything offensive here. Heck they actually try to make a pro-Indian pitch here (or a pro-turkey pitch as the case may be). And I particularly like how he covers his ridiculous foray into cultural insensitivity by suggesting that anyone who might disagree with him just doesnt get it. In fact Chang just doesnt get it. Not all moral messages have to be ladled on with a shovel - give kids some credit. Reply Dave Baxter says October 29 2013 at 604 pm He saw the movie for what it is frivolous and forgettable. A lesser offender than many others in terms of race but not without its own troubling elements. Scwartzman I think you lost your way in trying to comment on YouTube. Please stick to commenting there and lets aim to raise the intelligence and civility of Variety comments. Reply A.S. says October 29 2013 at 411 pm Isnt it possible that the tropes of ""American Indian"" the reviewer sees in the turkeys are simply an acknowledgment that the birds are also ""indigenous""? That is they like the American Indians portrayed in the film were there before the colonists. And if American Indians are portrayed in the film alongside the indigenous turkeys (which the reviewer acknowledges) then how can he claim that the birds are metaphors? The crows in Dumbo are so offensive (among many other reasons) because they stand-in for African Americans. That doesnt seem to be the case here. And even if they were metaphors as the reviewer suggests Im assuming they somehow ""win"" in the end. Couldnt that be seen as a clever anti-colonial message (which the reviewer also acknowledges but gives little credence to)? A moot point since it doesnt seem the reviewer is on the right track with the metaphor logic in either case. I cant speak for the quality of film but this seems like symbolic over-reach and a rather shallow (if not intellectually questionable) critique. Reply Gary says October 29 2013 at 318 pm This review sounds like someone desperately trying to find meaning/subtext in pretty much everything. Its an animated movie about turkeys not Citizen Kane.
