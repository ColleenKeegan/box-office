But in Benjamin Button the director assumes a greater challenge an epic melancholic romance that employs a multi-generational cast and groundbreaking visual effects. Its a testament to Finchers skill as a storyteller that the film actually works albeit sporadically.The script was adapted from a F Scott Fitzgerald story about a man who ages in reverse. Newborn geriatric Benjamin (Brad Pitt) is abandoned on the steps of an old folks home and raised by kindly nurse Queenie (Taraji P Henson). As a septuagenarian on crutches he meets love of his life Daisy (Cate Blanchett); in middle age he woos and wins her; as a young man their life together begins to fall apart.The screenplay was written by Forrest Gump scribe Eric Roth and it shows much of Button takes place in a Southern fantasia populated by brassy women and sassy black folks all of whom pepper their conversation with enough homespun homilies to fill a Readers Digest almanac. But thankfully this is Finchers movie not Roths and his exacting eye for bravura visual spectacle  carries the picture.At times infuriatingly banal at others unexpectedly powerful this is shameless Oscar bait that transcends hokey scripting thanks to a combination of sheer craft and some remarkable performances notably Tilda Swinton whose brief poignant turn crystallises the films timeless themes of love loss and regret.

I was very aware that I was in a dark room with a hundred strangers well I suppose better that than having to listen to this tripe. Worst piece of crap IaEUR(tm)ve seen since my last bad bout of food poisoning. Basically a troll gets younger as each year goes by and believe me that takes just as long as it sounds. Go see it if you want to see and old man pervert a small child get on a small boat live in a small cold country while steadily getting less and less wrinkled. I could see the same thing after getting out of long bath. The only light relief was an old man who was continuously struck by lightning this however was also mercilessly stabbed to death by the time it was shown for the 3rd of 7 times. This ""film"" was void of any interest emotion acting ability engagement and every other aspect that could make any motion picture watchable. To compare it to other movies would be wrong. I prefer to compare it to having my fingernails slowly pulled out while having a fat man sit on my face at least thataEUR(tm)s what Brad Pitt must have been threatened with to accept this role which he carried off without a hint of enthusiasm or display that he had ever acted before.

An exceedingly manipulative film that is filled that never quite gets over its own cleverness. Its been a long time since Ive seen a film that is this self-conscious. And with such a Pedigree behind the Production of it and in front of the Camera its a mystifying result. Perhaps one that smacks of either too much interference from the Money Boys - or not enough. Theres alot of Voice Over in this 2Hour 55 minute Feature and the result is distancing While I was being told what to feel and what to think I just didnt care about the Characters Im watching. While the CGI is an interesting notion I found it impossible to stay in the film while marvelling at Cate Blanchetts head morphed onto a Ballerinas body. Ultimately its an interesting experiment that detracted from the story rather than added to it. The fact that this film has been nominated for so many Oscars says alot about the Culture of Hollywood and what they deem to be a creditable film.. .

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor January 2 2009 Save for later Saved Young at heart Brad Pitt plays Benjamin Button a man who ages backward. Appearing younger as he gets older creates some poignancy in his love life as he only looks the same age as his amour for a brief period. MGM          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is about a man who ages backward. With a running time of almost three slow-going hours the movie definitely makes you feel as though youre aging forward.Based flimsily on a minor F. Scott Fitzgerald story its an anecdote stretched to would-be epic proportions.Brad Pitt plays the title character who is born in New Orleans at the close of World War I with a babys body and an octogenarians face and physiology. Abandoned by his horrified father on the steps of an old-age home little Benjamin whose mother died in childbirth is raised by an adoring black attendant Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? This ancient infant fits right into the crotchety surroundings. As he ages he becomes progressively younger. At 12 looking 70 he becomes infatuated with Daisy a residents red-headed granddaughter who is his own age. This duet is decidedly creepy but director David Fincher and screenwriter Eric Roth dont seem entirely clued into the weirdness. Theyre pushing innocence not gross-outs. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Daisy - whose name of course is meant to summon up the heroine from Fitzgeralds ""The Great Gatsby"" - will grow up to be played rather uncertainly by Cate Blanchett (who in a flashback framing device also gets the octogenarian treatment). Benjamin on the other hand is embodied just about from the start by Pitt. Courtesy of some amazing digital wizardry Pitt looks as wizened as Yoda or as fresh-faced as he was almost 20 years ago in ""Thelma and Louise."" Even as baby Benjamin Pitts heavily made-up head peers out at us. Audiences expecting to see Pitt as he looks today are going to be miffed.Going from old-young to young-old Benjamin sludges through the years. Along the way we get fugitive glimpses of the outside world. As a teenager looking 60 he signs up with the crew of a hard-drinking tugboat captain (Jared Harris) and later is seduced in a Russian hotel by an aristocratic Englishwoman (a sprightly Tilda Swinton). Back in New Orleans he is reunited with Daisy now a dancer and bon vivant bohemian. He follows her to New York then Paris. By this time they both look the same age and a love affair commences but with the sad realization that as she ages hell look ever younger while growing ever older. Got that straight?Despite the constant need to recalibrate just how young-old everybody is all the time there is some poignancy to this aspect of the story. The overhang of mortality is like a brooding presence. But if you bother to think it through this is a cockeyed fable Benjamins passage from old-young to young-old doesnt really mimic the ages of man. Its just a fancy conceit. It takes off from a comment once made by Mark Twain which inspired Fitzgeralds story that its too bad the best parts of life are at the beginning and the worst parts are at the end.This variation on G.B. Shaws ""Youth is wasted on the young"" is good for a laugh or a cry but it doesnt apply very much to this movie in which neither the beginning nor the end of Benjamins life evokes high drama. The unintended consequence of this movie may be that legions of Brad Pitt fans will recoil from the image of what their idol may one day look like. Such are the lessons of mortality Hollywood-style.If this movie is somewhat reminiscent of ""Forrest Gump"" thats because it was also scripted by Eric Roth who once again gets to indulge his dubious talent for simpleton mythmaking. Like Forrest Benjamin is a holy fool to whom everything happens. Except not very much happens. At least ""Forrest Gump"" a movie I disliked mightily brought in the outside world in a big way. ""Benjamin Button"" despite a few references to the world wars and hurricane Katrina is hermetically sealed in its own fatuous neverland. It doesnt even reference the racial struggles in the Old South where so much of the action actual and metaphorical takes place.Of course there are those who will argue that ""Benjamin Button"" isnt about history at all - its really a love story for the ages. Its more like a love story for the aged. By the time the movie finally ends that includes us all. Grade C (Rated PG-13 for brief war violence sexual content language and smoking.)

Scott Fitzgerald story about a man born in the twilight of life and gradually regressing toward dawn that has been adapted into a two-ton Oscar-season white elephant. Directed by David Fincher from a screenplay by Eric Roth Benjamin Button announces its epic intentions right from the start An orchestra tunes up on the soundtrack; two studio logos appear redesigned as button mosaics; and before you can say ""And the winner is . . . "" the movie fades in on a prosthetically aged Cate Blanchett dying in a hospital bed. Unsurprisingly the dying woman who is called Daisy asks her daughter (Julia Ormond) to read to her from a diary--the contents of which even less surprisingly play out as decades-spanning flashbacks.So we return to New Orleans circa 1918 where the merriment attending the end of World War I is interrupted by the arrival of a baby boy (played in a manner of speaking by Brad Pitt) who emerges from the womb looking like a midget Methuselah. His mother having died during his birth and his father terrified by the sight of him the strange infant is swiftly deposited on the doorstep of an old folks home. There the childless gold-hearted Negro proprietress (Taraji P. Henson though it could just as well be Butterfly McQueen) christens the boy ""Benjamin"" and opts to raise him as her own.Were already a long way from Fitzgerald whose Benjamin Button came into the world not only looking like an old man but having the body wizened mind and ornery temperament of one too. But its clear from the start that Roth and Fincher have considerably different aims. Closer in spirit to the Roth-scripted Forrest Gump Benjamin Button is to the first half of the 20th century what Gump was to the second--a panorama of the American experience as seen from the perspective of a wide-eyed Candide.Here as there Roth reduces our complex times to a parade of shockingly straight-faced kitsch A hellfire-and-brimstone tent revivalist imbues Benjamin with the holy spirit; a pygmy lothario serves as his introduction to the outside world; and a drunken Irish tugboat captain shows him how to be a man. But where Gump actively trivialized history Benjamin Button effectively ignores it Although Benjamin briefly exchanges fire with a German submarine during World War II and Hurricane Katrina makes a cameo toward the end this movie about a white baby raised by a black adoptive mother during the inglorious years of the Jim Crow South never so much as addresses race once.The strived-for atmosphere is whimsical and picaresque the results--save for Benjamins brief dalliance with the coolly amused wife (Tilda Swinton) of a British spy in Murmansk--mostly tedious. Very little about the first half of the film invites us in or gives inner life to the characters leaving only the admittedly fascinating spectacle of seeing Pitts computer-aged face digitally grafted on to the several pint-sized performers who help embody Benjamin over the first two decades of his existence. From a technological standpoint this is rivaled only by the later ""reverse aging"" effects that convincingly restore Pitt to his Thelma amp; Louise-era visage and that should if nothing else establish Benjamin Button as a cult film with the Botox crowd.The movie finally gives off a spark or two at exactly the midpoint when Benjamin is reunited with ballet dancer Daisy (Blanchett reverse-aged herself to resemble a twentysomething ingenue) whom he loved from afar as a boy but can now see socially without causing a scandal. The trajectory is obvious although Pitt and Blanchett surrender themselves to it with reasonable conviction Shes getting older while hes getting younger; eventually theyll meet in the middle somewhere but that too can not last. ""Will you still love me when I have acne when I wet the bed when Im afraid of whats under the stairs?"" he asks her. But it speaks to the treacly nature of the entire film that most of the scenarios potential unpleasantries are carefully elided. Unlike Fitzgeralds Button whose adolescence and eventual infancy bring with them a series of public and private humiliations Roth and Finchers Benjamin enters his second senescence in relative comfort attended to by the ever-loyal Daisy and the oppressively emotive stirrings of composer Alexandre Desplats score. No bed-wetting is ever shown.Perhaps its no wonder considering producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall are longtime Steven Spielberg associates that one of Benjamin Buttons closest cinematic precursors is ""Kick the Can"" the Spielberg-directed segment of 1983s Twilight Zone The Movie in which the denizens of a retirement home briefly revert to their childhood selves only to realize that no matter what age you are into every life some heartache must fall. There the folk wisdom took a mere 30 minutes to dispense; here it takes the better part of three hours which is odd indeed for a movie so concerned with the preciousness of time.It was just last year that Fincher delivered a great film also three hours on the subject of time. But whereas in Zodiac the passing years wrap around the characters like a vise catching them up obsessively in a single distended moment in Benjamin Button the ravages of time are trumped by a kind of eternal undying love that mere physics is at a loss to contain. And Fincher try as he might scarcely seems able to buy into Roths brand of Harlequin-romance hokum. In order for Benjamin Button to succeed on its own terms there shouldnt be a dry eye left in the house. Yet when the lights came up mine were like sandpaper.Mostly the film is an orgy of excess in which Fincher armed with a huge budget some of the best technicians in the business and every available brush in the digital paintbox indulges his passion for luxuriant image-making with little regard for whether the story merits (or can withstand) such grandiose treatment. ""All I have is my story"" Benjamin tells us in voiceover early on in the film. The true worth of any story though lies in the telling and some stories arent worth telling in the first place.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post There are movies that claim us in their opening minutes. Down the road we may be able to reconsider the whys and wherefores of how truly madly deeply a particular crush took hold. But we will never betray our original fondness. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is such a film. The love strikes early in director David Finchers fabulist masterpiece starring Brad Pitt. Benjamin has yet to make his arrival. Instead we are guided into the 80-year saga by an old woman in a hospital bed in New Orleans. Outside a storm rages one whose name we know painfully well. The womans name is Daisy and beneath old-person makeup lies Cate Blanchett. Her daughter Caroline attends to her. In a box of keepsakes she finds a notebook in it a first-person accounting of his life by Benjamin Button. ""I was born under unusual circumstances."" Indeed. The film is based on F. Scott Fitzgeralds 1920 short story about a man who ages backward. That story was itself a creative response to a Mark Twain quip ""Life would be infinitely happier if we could only be born at the age of 80 and gradually approach 18."" With its fantastic array of characters its triumphs and tragedies its love found and lost and found again the film follows our protagonist as he makes his way in life in a counter-clockwise fashion. Theres leisure to the storytelling a splendor that captures the movies celebratory but also melancholy ideas about our time on this mortal coil. Reminiscences are rendered in the scratchy jumpy images. Pitt stars but ""stars"" may not be the right verb in a film that uses the amazing trickery of technology and makeup to take the actor from a wrinkled arthritic infant to a man younger than the actor we know today. That said nothing should be taken away from Pitts loving performance. When he is born his father Thomas (Jason Flemyng) reacts badly and leaves him on the staircase of a nursing home in New Orleans. Queenie the caretaker (Taraji P. Henson) raises him as her own. At first theres little hope the frail baby will survive. But he does -- and thrives -- through the jazz age through wars through rock n roll and sexual revolution. And yes he has a love story. Benjamin and Daisy first meet when she is a vivacious child and he looks like a faltering old man. She gets to know him over the years because her grandmother is a resident of the nursing home. At some point the trajectories of his un-aging and her growing up will cross. In the meantime Benjamin has a lovely interlude with the wife of an English spy portrayed with muted warmth and a little frost by Tilda Swinton. Fitzgeralds story really is short all of 52 pages. At 2 1/2 hours ""Benjamin Button"" joins last years adaptation of ""There Will Be Blood"" as a film that takes the seed of a tale and grows it into a wholly other and astounding entity. Screenwriter Eric Roth uses the aging conceit to touch on historical moments (wars) and cultural forces (George Balanchine and The Beatles) all the while keeping it personal. Some may find this strategy too similar to Roths ""Forrest Gump."" But ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is smarter about Americas stories in particular those that refer to race. With touching chemistry Henson and Pitt make a rich argument about Queenie and Benjamins true meaning for each other. Julia Ormond brings the right kind of worried and wary tone to Daisys daughter. The cast is vibrantly warm even amusing from start to finish. Which brings us back to the movies opening moments. Expert clockmaker Monsieur Gateau (Elias Koteas) loses his beloved son during World War I. Commissioned to make a great clock for a train station the grief-stricken craftsman continues with his work delivering a clock that reflects his grief his yearning for a different outcome. Given the movies sweep this anecdote seems minor. Yet it contains the movies aching moral.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 25 2008 1159 p.m. ET If time flowed backward for me as it does for Brad Pitt in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" I would have been almost three hours younger by the time the end credits rolled around. No such luck on that score but David Finchers majestic fantasy left me happier than I could have imagined Id be. Eric Roths screenplay inspired by a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald turns on a single device. A baby is born old -- not just old but downright senescent -- and youthens as he grows. Yet the film which co-stars Cate Blanchett quickly outgrows any sense of gimmickry and matures into a one-of-a-kind meditation on mortality times inexorable passage and the fleeting sweetness of love. Watch a scene from the film ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. Time is of the essence in more ways than one. The production takes its time and uses it wisely in tracking Benjamins development from an ugly incubus through a teenage codger to a middle-aged 26-year-old whos certainly spry but still too old for Ms. Blanchetts Daisy. She is Bens contemporary a friend from their New Orleans childhood whos become an impossibly ravishing ballet dancer. Not until he grows 15 years younger and she grows 15 years older however are they right for each other physically as well as spiritually. ""My God"" Daisy says at one point in their mid-40s ""look at you -- youre perfect."" Its a charming laugh line since he has finally emerged as a fully recognizable Brad Pitt. And what a remarkable presence the actor is not just during that golden era but before and after when he has only his voice and eyes with which to fashion Bens character while the wonders of digital technology and age-confounding makeup provide his body and face. Its a great performance by any measure but let me count some of the other ways that Mr. Finchers film is remarkable. Ms. Blanchetts performance to be sure; shes breathtaking in a long red dress dancing in a fog-shrouded gazebo; otherwise shes simply dazzling and deeply affecting. A supporting cast that includes Tilda Swinton Taraji P. Henson Jason Flemyng and Jared Harris. Alexandre Desplats score as exquisite and evocative as the Scott Joplin concert waltz woven through it. Claudio Mirandas sumptuous cinematography Donald Graham Burts art direction and production design and Jacqueline Wests costumes. ""Benjamin Button"" is all of a visionary piece and its a soul-filling vision. Waltz With Bashir Ari Folmans ""Waltz With Bashir"" is an absolute stunner a feature-length animated documentary from Israel in which the force of moving drawings amplifies eerily powerful accounts of war shaky remembrance and rock-solid repression. See a clip from the film ""Waltz With Bashir."" Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. The film begins with the riveting image of vicious orange-eyed dogs coursing through the blue-black streets of nighttime Tel Aviv. By the time its over those dogs denizens of one ex-soldiers recurrent nightmare have been connected to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and to Israels indirect responsibility for a Christian militias massacre of Palestinian refugees. Connections were what Mr. Folman was after. A veteran of that war he made the film as an experiment in self-therapy after realizing how little he recalled of an experience that should have been as unforgettable as it was terrible. At bottom ""Waltz With Bashir"" -- the title relates to the battle rapture of an Israeli soldier in Beirut -- is a conventional documentary in which the filmmaker tries to elicit information from real-life countrymen who went to war with him. Yet it breaks with convention in two ways. The more obvious one is stylistic -- the testimony we hear often flattened and matter-of-fact is heightened by the sensational sometimes surreal animation. The other break is substantive and shocking. If connections were the goal disconnections are the discovery. Mr. Folmans witnesses dont remember their time in Lebanon any more reliably than he does so his self-therapy proves a failure. But his signal success lies in charting the human minds gift for keeping bad memories at bay. War is hell as everyone claims to know but heres a baleful new perspective on the subject. Wars are fought the film tells us then literally forgotten. Valkyrie Two dramatic arcs intersect in ""Valkyrie"" a big old-fashioned action adventure starring Tom Cruise as Claus von Stauffenberg the aristocratic German army colonel who in 1944 led the July 20 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. In addition to the plot itself theres the arc of Mr. Cruises career from ""Risky Business"" to the riskier business of embodying an authentic German hero in a lavish English-language production with limited suspense; the audience -- at least some of it -- knows that the plot failed. So how does the film work? Well enough in the end. Mr. Cruises performance turns out to be brisk and reasonably plausible though unexceptional while the production as a whole succeeds as an elaborate procedural impressively staged in historical locations. See a clip from the film ""Valkyrie."" Video courtesy of United Artists. The director was Bryan Singer best known for ""The Usual Suspects""; he worked from a script by his writer on that film Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander. Newton Thomas Sigel did the stunning cinematography and Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb collaborated on the splendid production design. Mr. Singer comes as close as anyone could to sustaining the illusion of action when nothing is happening and nothing much happens for quite a while apart from the hatching of Stauffenbergs plot and the exchange of meaningful glances. (My favorite moment of throbbing inertia comes when someone says hes going to lunch and the announcement is met by a tympani roll.) Once the plotters plunge into action though ""Valkyrie"" becomes both an exciting thriller and a useful history lesson. Younger members of the audience may not have known that the Nazi armys officer corps contained nests of determined resistance to Hitlers madness. Revolutionary Road ""Revolutionary Road"" was adapted from Richard Yatess highly regarded novel about stifling conformity in 1950s suburbia. The movie is stifling all right and depressing in the bargain. The road of the title is the address of April and Frank Wheeler the couple played by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio; its also the figurative road that April wants them to follow an escape route from suburban life to the freedom of expatriate life in Paris. The best scene is the opening one when April and Frank first meet at a Manhattan party and he cheerfully admits that he has no idea what he wants to do with his life. In fact Frank is a black hole that sucks up whatever energy the movie musters. (Ms. Winslet has several powerful scenes and Zoe Kazan finds variety and spontaneity in the minor role of Franks sexual playmate at the office.) The pompous direction was inflicted by Sam Mendes who seems to regard the 1950s as a foreign country. Last Chance Harvey ""Last Chance Harvey"" is a good chance to see two superb actors having their way with wafer-thin material. Dustin Hoffmans Harvey and Emma Thompsons Kate meet by chance in London. Chance in this case means the laborious workings of an anti-surprise script; in scene after scene the outcome is clear from the start. The title also refers to Harveys plight. Long divorced and newly jobless he has flown in from New York for the wedding of his almost-estranged daughter and sees Kate as his last shot at a happy life. See a clip from ""Last Chance Harvey."" For a while Joel Hopkinss romantic comedy is little more than bright banter and naked contrivance. Parallel passages follow the equally lonely Harvey and Kate (she works in customer relations at Heathrow airport) as they dont meet again then almost do then do. But the film catches fire when Harvey brings Kate to the wedding reception. Thats where Mr. Hoffman seizes a good moment that the script has given him and turns it into a speech thats worth the price of admission. Suddenly the actors art transforms contrivance into the defining moment of a mans life. Marley amp; Me The Marley of ""Marley amp; Me"" is by his owners account the worlds worst dog. This is far from the worlds worst dog movie -- youd have to be made of granite to resist all the charms of a free-spirited 100-pound Lab. Yet the production manages against heavy odds to make its canine star an incorrigible bore. The problem is bad parenting. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston are John and Jenny Grogan a husband and wife who supposedly learn life lessons from Marley as their family grows through the years. What lessons though? They never seem to grasp the concept that dogs must be trained. Find related TV listings at LocateTV. Bedtime Stories Disneys ""Bedtime Stories"" looks cute in the trailers thanks to a bug-eyed computer-generated guinea pig named Bugsy. Be forewarned though. Bugsy is only a shill for a particularly crude and disjointed Adam Sandler comedy. If you listen carefully to the strains of ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" during the Disney corporate intro you may hear Walt moaning in his grave. See a clip from ""Bedtime Stories."" Mr. Sandler is no stranger to crudity; its intrinsic to his slob esthetic. ""Im like the stink on your feet"" he says in this one ""Ill always be around."" Hes Skeeter Bronson a hotel handyman who tells his niece and nephew bedtime stories that have a magical way of coming true. (Theyre garishly overproduced stories that mimic ""Star Wars"" assorted Westerns and ""Spartacus."") Still the crudity here isnt confined to a few fart jokes. As a PG-rated film opening on Christmas Day under the Disney banner ""Bedtime Stories"" would seem to promise fairly wholesome family entertainment. What it delivers is the glitzy allure of a hotel setting smarmy double entendres Ferrari lust Beverly Hills bling and pneumatic babes -- one of the characters is a surrogate Paris Hilton. The real bug-eyed guinea pigs will be the little kids in the audience.

Photo Merrick Morton AP Movie review Curious Case of Benjamin Button 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Drama. Starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Directed by David Fincher. (PG-13. 167 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The lesson here is never to aim to make a great movie before locking in the framework for a good one. To aim for greatness otherwise invites all kinds of risks - the possibility of reaching high and crashing of mistaking the somber for the serious of creating the form of greatness without the content. In short theres the danger of making something as pretty and vacant as ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" Visually the film from director David Fincher is flawless. The story begins in 1918 and extends into present day and at every point the art direction and clothing meticulously re-create the respective eras. The digital cinematography subtly evokes earlier photography. The stars are major and Oscar ready. In every way the movie looks like somebodys idea of a great movie just as its length - 167 minutes - proclaims its importance. But the proclamation is untrue and all the trappings are in the service of a story thats emotionally false and fundamentally unimportant. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" takes its inspiration from one of F. Scott Fitzgeralds weakest stories a labored attempt at whimsy in the Twain or Bret Harte vein. Screenwriter Eric Roth takes only Fitzgeralds central premise - a man is born old and gets younger as he advances through life - but he drops everything else adopting a tone of sorrow and longing thats actually much more in line with Fitzgeralds other better work. Benjamin is born shriveled and wrinkly with clogged arteries and arthritis and left by his father at the door of an old-age home where hes brought up by Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) the caretaker. Slowly very slowly he gets to the point that he can walk and by the time hes about 12 - with a youthful spirit inside an aging face - he looks a lot like Robert Redford. As a teenager he makes a soul mate connection with a little girl named Daisy and Daisy becomes the emotional pivot and throughline for this episodic tale. Its a very loose throughline however as there are lots of episodes and decades to eat up before Benjamin can land at midlife in the early 1960s looking as breezy and windblown as JFK at Hyannis Port. Until then Brad Pitt spends most of the movie covered in age makeup with his sad eyes staring out quietly like an angel observing the pain of humanity. Half the time he seems on the verge of saying something incredibly true and revealing but whatever it is he never says it. To call Benjamin a passive protagonist is not enough. Hes all but inert and the movie defines him almost exclusively in terms of his aging process. He has no ambition no interests no position save that of an outsider and no desire except for Daisy. He is an uninteresting person to whom something medically interesting has happened. For the screenwriter this is the weakest possible choice. That said its understandable that Benjamin should be a quiet sorrowful person in that he sees more acutely than anyone else the passage of time. Everyone else is just aging together not noticing day-to-day changes but Benjamin is pulling in the opposite direction so the motion is accelerated and his perception is acute. His affliction plugs him right into the sadness of the universe and puts him at a distance from the rest of humanity. Unfortunately that also puts the audience at a distance from the other characters just as Benjamins lack of vividness mutes our concern for his fate. The result of all this is a rather cold piece a series of interludes presented under glass. When Benjamin has an affair with an upper-class Englishwoman (Tilda Swinton) for example we watch as though witnessing a phenomenon not an emotional exchange. And because nothing ever registers much with Benjamin each episode lands without meaning. Anything could have been cut from this script just as anything could have been added. The movies excruciating length is without dramatic or thematic justification. Its merely an assertion of Oscar-worthiness. Ultimately the whole enterprise hangs on the Daisy side of the story. Once Daisy becomes a woman Cate Blanchett takes over the role and through camera wizardry the 39-year-old Blanchett looks 20. Shes less convincing playing a 20-year-old and her flighty impetuousness looks effortful especially with Pitt just standing there like a sensitive zombie. He stays zombie-like and she gradually slows down as they meet periodically over the course of the years. ""Benjamin Button"" is structured around their respective meetings - each time he gets younger and each time she gets older - as we wait for them to get close enough in age to make love without making each other sick. Though ""Benjamin Button"" is soporific throughout most of its second hour its fate and its failure are sealed only in its last third when it resolves the Benjamin-Daisy relationship in a forced and false way. To make matters worse the movie is revealed to have had nothing to say all along - except that time is cruel and the whole mortality thing is just a crying shame. -- Advisory Sexual situations and adult subject matter.

Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Deck the halls with scheming Nazis--and withered arthritic babies and seething suburban housewives. Those are the grim bundles waiting under the Hollywood tree this recessional holiday season. Its somehow appropriate to the economic moment that the three big Christmas-week releases-- Valkyrie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Revolutionary Road--are about grand failures of one kind or another. Theres the failed plot to assassinate Hitler in Valkyrie the failure of the human body (even a backward-aging one) to conquer time in Button and the Titanic-sized failure of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprios marriage in Revolutionary Road. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Advertisement It might be argued that all three movies not only depict failure but enact it. Valkyrie the first film out of United Artists Studios since Tom Cruise became the studios sole head last summer has been something of a cursed production dogged by rumors of reshoots and perpetually changing release dates. Its director Bryan Singer talks big but he has to be anxious about the films reception after the universally shrugged-at Superman Returns (2006). And as Slates Stephen Metcalf suggests in his glorious reading of Tom Cruise-as-market-bubble the notion of the stolidly perky Cruise playing a one-eyed one-handed would-be Hitler assassin is just inherently funny. Given all these obstacles Valkyrie comes off surprisingly well. The first half-hour or so does proffer some unintended chuckles as the script strains unnecessarily to provide its hero Col. Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise) with background character and motivation. Motivation?? We dont need to learn about the source of Stauffenbergs war wounds (he loses an eye and a hand in a North African bombing raid) or his love for his wife (Carice van Houten) to understand that he wants to kill Hitler. We get it. On with the Hitler-killing Once Singer dispenses with the introductory pathos and gets to the nuts and bolts of Stauffenbergs plan Valkyrie becomes an admirably modest and compact suspense thriller. Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators in the German army (played by the plummily British likes of Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp) arrange to smuggle an explosive-laden briefcase into a meeting with the chancellor. They also secretly make changes to a succession plan Hitler has had drawn up in the event of his death (occasioning one of the films few intentionally funny lines ""Now all you have to do is get Hitler to sign it""). For a thriller with a thoroughly foreordained outcome Valkyrie does a pretty good job at making the viewers palms sweat. Especially so soon after the tedious pieties of The Reader Im not sure I want more from my Nazi holiday viewing than that. Revolutionary Road(Dreamworks) Sam Mendes adaptation of the 1961 novel by Richard Yates hasnt a hair out of place. Its a textbook example of a well-crafted movie beautifully shot impeccably acted and structured like an elegant three-act play. (You can almost imagine the red velvet curtain descending at the end of each act.) So why does the movie feel as pleasantly deadening as the midcentury Connecticut suburb where it takes place? It certainly isnt Kates or Leos fault. Winslet is as ever divine as the repressed April Wheeler who gave up her dreams of becoming an actress to marry Frank (DiCaprio). And while DiCaprio lacks Winslets emotional reach as an actor hes perfectly cast as the cocky self-deluded Frank who commutes to an office job he hates in order to support their two children. Bored stiff by their emotionally sterile life April suggests they shake things up by moving the whole family to Paris. This prospect briefly rekindles the Wheelers marriage until ... well lets just say the last scene isnt a happy family picnic atop the Eiffel Tower. Advertisement Maybe this movies curious emptiness has to do precisely with the actors appeal their matinee-scale beauty and charisma. Yates novel used implied interior monologue--what Flaubert called ""free indirect style""--to indicate the vast gulf between how April and Frank thought of themselves (as thwarted bohemians) and what they really were (fearful middle-aged suburbanites). Without that layer of built-in irony the Wheelers protestations that theyre too good for the life theyre trapped in seem straightforwardly true and what should be a bleak social satire instead reads as a banal melodrama. When April miserably informs her husband that for all their aspirations ""Were just like everybody else"" the audience reflexively protests ""No youre not Youre Kate and Leo He gave his life for you at the end of Titanicfor Gods sake"" The couples on-screen history is part of what gives the Wheelers their undeniable chemistry (even if most of Frank and Aprils chemistry is used to formulate the vitriol they hurl at one another). But that same history--Leo proclaiming himself ""king of the world"" Kates arms outstretched at the prow--is a part of what keeps us on the outside of the Wheelers story unable to find the small-time schemers in the faces of these larger-than-life stars. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button(Warner Bros.) adapted by David Fincher from an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story is the lengthiest and most ambitious of all the Christmas releases yet its the one I have the least to say about. Two hours and 55 minutes is a long time to sustain a mood of puckish whimsy especially when the frame-story narrator is a dying old woman (Cate Blanchett in age makeup) lying immobilized on a hospital bed. Fincher is a technical magician He can convincingly (digitally?) create the illusion that Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is aging in reverse; that he--and we--are caught in the middle of a World War II naval battle; and that Cate Blanchett a 39-year-old mother of three is an airborne teenage ballerina. But Finchers magic cant transform him from the coldly dispassionate misanthropist of Se7en Fight Club and Zodiac into a sentimental humanist and it cant turn Brad Pitt into the kind of actor who can carry a movie like this. Dont get me wrong Pitts great in character roles as a comic grotesque or an unrepentant scoundrel. (See Burn After Reading or for that matter Fight Club.) But as a passive introspective leading man like Benjamin hes just dull. Theres not enough going on behind those deep-blue peepers to justify a Forrest Gump-esque jaunt through 80-plus years of American history (though it is amusing to watch that familiar chiseled Pitt face emerge from layers of excellent age makeup). The melancholy final scenes have Blanchett as Benjamins true love Daisy caring for her once-husband as he gradually regresses to babyhood and she approaches old age. This vision of two lives criss-crossing as they ebb finally achieves a profundity the rest of the movie strains for but it comes about two hours and 25 minutes too late.

Sadly I was that third person the one that found it dull and overly conceptual -- missing a chance to do something meaningful at every turn. Does this mean Im right? Does it mean you should skip Benjamin Button and its near three-hour running time? I suppose it depends on your tastes. This is definitely an artsy film (though more in terms of concept than in how its actualized) but its a good chance to see attractive folks act well too. However I think its missing something elemental. What exactly? Lets take the journey together. Brad Pitt plays the title character Benjamin Button a man who ages in reverse (as the trailers have indicated). This is an extremely clever concept no doubt about it. He starts as a little old baby when the story begins and folks weave in and out of his life as he ages and grows backwards. So far so good. Theres definitely enough meat on that bone to make something for the ages. Rarely does a studio film start with as much going for it as Button does. Besides Pitt theres Oscar darling Cate Blanchett. Shes joined by all-star Tilda Swinton plus the movie is directed by David Fincher (Seven Fight Club Zodiac). In fact if you told me I had to give the movie a grade without seeing it knowing only who put it together Id probably just throw it an ""A"" and call it good. Where The Curious Case of Benjamin Button goes wrong is with its overall lack of punch. There simply isnt much going on throughout. In fact it seems like Fincher has gone to great pains to make the whole ""aging backwards"" thing ordinary and relevant to our own lives. Only that method makes the film slow and tedious -- if were not to be amazed by the fantastic if Pitts Button really is just some schmoe with the same problems as us ... then why bother with the storytelling device at all? Button is damaged by its very severe need to be an Oscar nominated film. The music swells at the appropriate places the characters exchange meaningful glances throughout but none of it feels earned. Button fails with the fantastic in a way that a film like The Green Mile doesnt. Benjamin Button never takes the chance to amaze you with anything besides the initial concept and so all the solid character work never really adds up to anything. That said this film will definitely resonate with some movie-goers. It is shot well it does have lovely acting and it certainly has life lessons to impart. I think this film versus Revolutionary Road is a bit like the American Beauty versus Magnolia debate of 1999. My group of friends and I vehemently favored one over the other with little common ground between the two. It comes down to personal taste I suppose. (For the record I was on the side of Magnolia then though I find myself in Mendes corner this time around.) See Benjamin Button. Why not? Its still better than most movies in the world. If you dont love it you can come back later and take refuge in a spot that agrees with you. And if you do love it you can come back and tell me that Im a fool. Ill accept that sort of passionate discourse. In my opinion thats a far better deal than the movie itself will give you ... because its got no heart.

Pegging Brad Pitts age at any point in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button can distract. WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Who would have thought Brad Pitt even aged artificially could bear a resemblance to Yoda? The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (   out of four) is worth seeing just for the superb prosthetic makeup and seamless computer-generated effects in which Pitts head is digitally imposed onto older bodies. The film ambitious if flawed also is lyrical and melancholy as it tells the story of a man aging backward. But the tale though laudably imaginative is overlong and not as emotionally involving as it could be. David Fincher one of the best contemporary directors has made a notable departure from such darker fare as Zodiac and Fight Club. The influence of screenwriter Eric Roth is perhaps even stronger than Finchers capable direction. Roth wrote 1994s Forrest Gump and Button has notable similarities. Benjamin is a passive and reactive character and Pitt is appropriately understated. The long romance between Button and Daisy is less convincing; we never get a full sense of who she is. The film is at its best when spinning fantastic yarns of Benjamins bizarre long life. Afflicted with a rare malady he is born elderly. His father (Jason Flemying) finds the wizened infant repulsive and abandons him on a doorstep. Benjamin is raised by Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) the proprietor of an old folks home where he stands out with his childish antics. When a little girl named Daisy (Elle Fanning) visits her grandmother a friendship is born. Benjamin leaves home at 17 (looking like 60) goes off to sail the world and has his first love affair when he is seduced by a married woman (Tilda Swinton). Soon he sheds his wrinkles and emerges in familiar handsome form. He and Daisy (now played by Cate Blanchett) meet again closer in age and their romance starts and sputters. The backward-aging can be distracting. Trying to determine Benjamins approximate age at various intervals can take you out of the film. Button is a cinematic curiosity. Set in a visually stunning realm of heightened reality it is at times symbolic and enigmatic other times baroque and convoluted and also folksy and predictable. Though it doesnt always work as a parable about life Button is never dull and the conclusion is graceful and poignant. (Rated PG-13 for brief war violence sexual content language and smoking.

"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Moviemaking at its best | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button Moviemaking at its best""You never know whats coming for you"" goes the mantra of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button  but viewers of this exceptional love story need have no doubt.Blanchett teams with Brad Pitt for the second time in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.  (MERRICK MORTON / ASSOCIATED PRESS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Dec. 24 2008Starring Brad Pitt Cate Blanchett Tilda Swinton Julia Ormond and Taraji P. Henson. Directed by David Fincher. 159 minutes. At major theatres. PG ""You never know whats coming for you"" goes the mantra of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button but viewers of this exceptional love story need have no doubt.A magical and moving account of a man living his life resoundingly in reverse very loosely based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short tale from 1922 it delivers top-notch moviemaking in every department.Most impressive of all is the digital breakthrough that allows Brad Pitt to change so convincingly from very old to very young placing his face upon the forms of stand-in actors. The technique is seamless allowing Pitt to be in much more of the film than might otherwise be feasible in a story spanning the decades and events from World War I to Hurricane Katrina. Article Continued BelowIts an uncommon pleasure to behold a movie where computers enhance the creativity rather than overwhelm it. Directed by David Fincher (Zodiac Fight Club) whose command of the medium continues to amaze the film has some of the Everyman appeal of Forrest Gump screenwriter Eric Roths earlier work. But the insights into birth death romance and sadness are deeper than a box of chocolates and more Zen-like.There is no abiding message. Just the wistful observation that life has a way of taking its own path sometimes a backwards one and we do have choices in how we travel it.""You can change or you can stay the same. There are no rules to this thing"" Pitts Benjamin says in voiceover.We are all swept by errant winds which are made manifest through the films framing device of the 2005 arrival of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.As the city prepares to evacuate an elderly woman played by an almost unrecognizable Cate Blanchett lies in a hospital bed facing her own imminent departure. But first she has a story to tell her adult daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) who waits by her side.A battered diary is produced and Caroline commences reading the account of Benjamin Button a man born in New Orleans in 1918 on the night that World War I ends. ""I was born under unusual circumstances..."" the diary begins and thats putting it mildly. The baby is so alarmingly different - he looks like a tiny old man - hes immediately abandoned by his father (Jason Flemyng).The child is taken in by the kindly Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) an attendant at a seniors residence. Its the perfect hideaway for the baby she names Benjamin whose wrinkled visage and poor eyesight and hearing arent deemed unusual by those around him. It slowly dawns upon Queenie and Benjamin that although he was born old he is growing younger. As the days turn to months and months to years he becomes ever more youthful and vigorous allowing the naive but curious Benjamin to fully engage the world in all its joys and disappointments.He becomes a sailor - water is a recurrent symbol as is time - and joins the crew of Captain Mike (Jared Harris) a tugboat captain with a thirst for drink and a taste for trouble. Their travels take them to Murmansk Russia where Benjamin learns about sex from restless socialite Elizabeth (Tilda Swinton). Benjamin and the Captain also see battle during World War II entering waters patrolled by Nazi U-boats where the films most frenzied action occurs.Drifting in and out of Benjamins life during these peripatetic sojourns is Daisy a flaming redhead and talented dancer who is initially many years Benjamins junior yet a kindred spirit nonetheless. Her dancing takes her to New York Paris and back to New Orleans following a timeline where her natural aging will eventually intersect with Benjamins unnatural youthfulness with attendant complications of both heart and mind.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button runs nearly three hours and has few ""wow"" moments in it yet it never drags or wallows in sentiment. Watching Benjamin age in reverse has the curious effect of making you appreciate how your own life runs forward and at a far faster pace once youth has been left behind.The film has been a long-gestating labour of love by all concerned and you see it in the astounding attention to detail. Claudio Mirandas desaturated cinematography Alexandre Desplats melancholic score and Donald Graham Burts golden production design together with Finchers meticulous direction give the film the glow of a painting by Rembrandt or Vermeer. Expect all of these craftsmen to do well in next months Oscar nominations.Less certain and pity for it are kudos for Pitt and Blanchett. They deliver the kind of non-showy performances that rarely win awards. They are more reactive than proactive in the film and they are together in their ""real"" ages and forms for a relatively brief time. Yet the stillness of their acting is the hardest kind to do well and its exactly what the picture requires. Its been said that the unexamined life is not worth living. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button suggests an addendum a life lived backwards can be far more enriching.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

An earnest epic inspired by the F. Scott Fitzgerald story of a man born old who ages backwards this ambitious effort shares more than its screenwriter (Eric Roth) with the Oscar-winning 94 hit Forrest Gump. With a title character who collides with some of the 20th centurys biggest events a setting in a storied Southern city a tale of true love through the decades and even a friendship with a guy on a boat (a tug instead of a shrimp trawler) The Curious Case of Benjamin Button puts a Hollywood sheen on a decidedly eccentric yarn. If you cant see the Forrest for the Bs its probably because Brad Pitts performance as Benjamin Button goes through many more permutations than did Hanks Academy Award-winning portrayal. Remarkable digital imaging paints Pitts twinkly blue-eyed mug onto the shriveled form of a newborn and several smallish stooped-over stand-ins playing Benjamin in his eighties and seventies. When the complete Pitt finally appears the screen magic has already done its work - and a good deal of the actors. The movie star summons up wit grace and a surprising tenderness but for all of Benjamin Buttons scope Pitts work in it is still not particularly deep or nuanced. Its 1918 in New Orleans when Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng) a well-to-do button manufacturer experiences the double trauma of losing his wife in childbirth and gaining a son with the gnarled visage and arthritic symptoms of an advanced octogenarian. Its too much for this Button to bear and so the father in desperate straits abandons his swaddled newborn on the steps of a retirement home. It is here that Queenie (Taraji P. Henson radiating warmth and vitality) the caretaker of Nolan House brings the ""baby"" in adopting it as her own. And so Benjamin grows up - and grows younger - nurtured and loved by this lively black woman in the company of a folksy clutch of senior citizens. And it is at Nolan House where Benjamin meets Daisy. Shes the feisty little granddaughter of one of the residents and she takes a liking to Benjamin - and vice versa. Clearly theres a Big Connection there despite the disparity of years. Several decades later as Daisy matures into a beautiful ballerina (enter Cate Blanchett) and Benjamin becomes a strapping fella doing his Brando impersonation on a vintage Royal Enfield the two fall madly in love. All of this - and theres much more believe me - seems like an odd choice for David Fincher the director who steered Pitt through the fierce and surreal Fight Club and whose most recent feature was the creepy true-life serial-killer drama Zodiac. Within its big themes of age experience wisdom race and love Fincher works in a few kooky motifs - an old coot who recalls the many times hes been struck by lightning - and gets an exceptionally keen supporting turn from Tilda Swinton. Shes an English ambassadors wife who deflowers Benjamin and then meets with him for a series of nightly trysts in a hotel in the snowbound Russian port of Murmansk. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button clocks in at a hefty 2 hours 47 minutes but unlike the insufferable Australia you rarely feel its length. That on its own is a considerable accomplishment. Its too bad that there isnt any real chemistry between Pitt and Blanchett. The two stars - he with his broad forehead she with those cheekbones - look dashing together as they meet and remeet in Paris New York and New Orleans but the pair dont emit much heat. In fact for all its hokey American charm its grand scale and sense of history the same can be said for the film itself - eye-catching clever but lacking any real passion.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (PG-13) Paramount (168 min.) Directed by David Fincher. With Brad Pitt Cate Blanchett. Opens Dec 25 at theaters in New Jersey. TWO STARS Perhaps every generation gets its own ""Forrest Gump"" whether it wants it or not. Certainly ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is ours full of cheap magical realism repurposed history inescapably colorful characters and a passive hero who stands still amidst it all. Its like a box of chocolates but with hollow centers. The parallels are easy to understand -- the story is less an adaption of the F. Scott Fitzgerald tale than an original by ""Gump"" screenwriter Eric Roth. But its originality is pre-owned full of themes (the South boats war fierce mothers lost loves) that the earlier movie already played. All these elements are of course timeless. But Roth puts them in the same framework telling the story through the eyes of a saintly special narrator (a childlike man in ""Gump"" a backwards-aging one in ""Button"") adding a sticky-sweet symbol (a feather there a hummingbird here) and hewing to the same shrugging pseudo-philosophy of ""life happens."" This time the fantasy begins with the end of World War I as a boy is born in New Orleans -- a squalling infant with the wizened features of an old man. (An admitted improvement over Fitzgerald who had Benjamin looking like and sounding like Father Time.) Swiftly abandoned he grows up in an ""old folks home"" where he fits right in. Except as Benjamin grows up he grows young. This provides for some irony in his affair with a haughty English aristocrat (although he looks to be a man of 65 shes really the older woman). And some tragedy too as he finally finds love with a Southern beauty of the ""right"" age -- only to realize that theyre moving in opposite temporal directions. But its real meaning is never brought home. Not that there isnt an actor here trying. Tilda Swinton is striking as the British snob; Cate Blanchett is her usual remarkable self as a beautiful ballerina. And Brad Pitt working hard at the very least masters the peculiarities of the New Orleans accent which mixes a gracious Southern lilt with awkward New York vowels. But in doing him favors the makeup and CGI do him no favors (even when hes supposedly in his 60s Pitt is clearly his handsome self under some gray hair). And Roths script gives him very little to play -- hes an observer of life never a participant in his own. All of this comes as a surprise in a film from director David Fincher whose best movies (""Seven"" ""Fight Club"" ""Zodiac"") have been both dark and driven by action. But Fincher is one of those rare filmmakers who always works from other peoples scripts; hes dependent on other hands for his narratives. And those hands hold nothing here. Not that Fincher a remarkable stylist simply sits back. He uses the wide screen impressively (somewhere a cinema-studies major is writing an appreciation of his use of slashing diagonals -- rivers fences parades). There are painterly seascapes masterful special effects (with Pitts face cut-and-pasted onto different bodies) and an inventive use of film stocks. But it also feels like overkill. The CGI scenery is like similar shots in ""Australia"" too impressionist -- drawing attention to its own artificiality. The photography -- with some flashbacks presented in scratch7ed and faded color -- is too clever by half. (Real memories dont have scratches and real movies from 1918 wouldnt be in Technicolor.) And when all is said and done -- and in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" it takes nearly three hours to say and do it all -- what does Benjamin really stand for? Very little it seems beyond wanderlust and a search for meaning -- a quest which conveniently lets him run away whenever real responsibilities emerge yet keeps him from ever seeing the world through anyones eyes but his own. Its filmmakers may think theyve created a fantasy about a man who is born old and grows young. But what theyve really done is filmed a tragedy about a man who never grows up at all. Rating note The film contains sexual situations and violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Its the stuff of fables and folk tales. An infant is born prematurely old then ages in reverse. Cataracts and arthritic joints heal wizened skin becomes supple and the child moves from decrepitude to vigorous maturity then youth. Meanwhile the people in his life grow wrinkled and brittle. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" follows a character whose life is out of joint detailing his extraordinary journey with breathtaking beauty and technical finesse. That shouldnt surprise fans of director David Fincher whose ""Fight Club"" ""Seven"" and ""Zodiac"" are works of formal virtuosity. The revelation here is that after a career making chilly melodramas Fincher can tell such a human story. The film was adapted from an F. Scott Fitzgerald story by Eric Roth whose script for ""Forrest Gump"" followed a similar picaresque path. In New Orleans in 1918 Benjamin (Brad Pitt) is born prematurely old. His mother expires and his father abandons the freakish infant at a nursing home. Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) an attendant raises the boy as her own while the centers residents accept his condition as an odd illness. Fincher renders the era with a precise eye for atmosphere and physical detail. The photography in the early chapters of the film has a slightly gauzy look as if the pictures were being recorded by a box camera on antique film stock. As the film moves into the more immediate past the haze subtly drops away and hues unobtrusively grow stronger. Fincher nimbly matches the look and the era even mimicking herky-jerky silent films with a running gag about a human lightning rod. Benjamin is aware that his odd gift is also a curse. Time and again he loses the women in his life as they pass like chronological ships in the night. His reverse aging dramatizes that familiar phrase ""they grew apart."" His first affair initiated by the wife of a British diplomat is an arms-length relationship physically tender but with no mention of love. Tilda Swinton plays the aloof Englishwoman as a perplexing blend of passion and emotional reserve. Benjamin learns to withhold himself and Pitts performance is equally reticent. Queenie warned her boy ""You never know whats comin for ya"" but he understands all too well. Reuniting with his childhood sweetheart Daisy (played as a girl by Elle Fanning and later by Cate Blanchett) he knows that a long future together is impossible. Still he opts for whatever time they can share. The film captures his yearning and fatalism with deftly composed images. Staging a key scene between ever-younger Benjamin and fading Daisy in her mirror-lined dance studio deftly reflects the storys themes of loss and transience. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for brief war violence sexual content language and smoking. There is much to praise in the film including a blood-and-thunder naval battle breathtaking effects and sumptuous production design but there are serious problems too. Two clumsy framing devices bookend the story one with elderly Daisy in a hurricane-swept New Orleans hospital one about a blind clockmaker who builds a reverse-time clock as a tribute to soldiers sacrificed in World War I. The script is stuffed with such secondary characters who add Gump-ish incidents but little dramatic oomph. Worse the biggest special effects are piled into the beginning a succession of miraculous images that peel away as the story progresses. Thats a lot like life childhood wonderment eroding as we ossify into humdrum maturity but it gives the yarn an anticlimactic structure. Attractive as Pitt is in the youthful final reels its the images of him as an ugly limping child that haunt the memory.

Brad Pitt went under a huge transformation to play Benjamin Button. Photo Kim Coffman The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 1 / 1 Back to Gallery When Benjamin Button says he was born ""under unusual circumstances"" believe it. Thanks to a blind clockmaker and a backward-running timepiece in a train station he starts out life as a wizened old man roughly the size and shape of a baby. Ugly as sin he is -- his little joints kinked with arthritis his infant face puckered with age. The first sight of this wee geriatric beastie represents Shock No. 1 in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Shock No. 2 Its touching. Lets not mince words. Director David Fincher has turned out an overlong Forrest Gumpian exercise in mannered whimsy. Its sentimental; its episodic; it dawdles. Brad Pitt spends a good length of screen time drinking tea with Tilda Swinton. But its also bewitching. Only the daftest magic can make a clock run backward and only Hollywood sorcery of the finest order can turn a story this long and this unlikely into one of the years most endearing fairy tales. Adapted by Gump screenwriter Eric Roth and Robin Swicord from a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald The Curious Case of Benjamin Button follows a life lived in reverse. Born old he turns younger with age. But only in body -- his mind starts out as a childs and develops on schedule putting him in spectacles and a wheelchair around the time hes learning to read. Otherwise he fits right in with the crowd at the New Orleans old-folks home where hes dumped by his freaked-out father (Jason Flemyng) following the death of his mother in childbirth. There Benjamin is reared by the kind-hearted Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) in the midst of eccentricity and warmth. As the residents around him mark birthdays teach piano and tell tales of being struck by lightning -- multiple times illustrated in flickering sepia -- he grows taller and younger until he begins to resemble ... Brad Pitt. What a wild transformation he undergoes in Benjamin Button. Employing C.G.I. and heroic amounts of makeup (not to mention a collection of pretty swell bald wigs) the movie shrinks and shrivels one of the worlds most recognizable figures into a strangely mummified bobble-head. But the true marvel in these early scenes is the disarming sweetness of Pitts performance the way he projects the stubbornness of a toddler or the venturesome spirit of a boy on a lark after sundown. How uncanny -- or OK curious -- to find such innocence in the face of old age. Hes still just a boy inside when he first spies Daisy (Elle Fanning as a child Cate Blanchett as a woman) a strawberry-haired girl drawn to his oddness and his spunk. Their romance seems as inevitable as it is doomed limited to that brief fertile period when their paths might cross in maturity. The Fincher of Se7en and Zodiac is one morbid filmmaker thoroughly obsessed with the shifting ephemera of life ""You never know whats comin for you"" say Queenie and her beau (Mahershalalhashbaz Ali) repeating their own version of the Forrest Gump chocolate mantra. The one thing comin for sure is death whether it arrives backward or headfirst in a series of hospital framing scenes as Daisy gasps her last. Her middle-aged daughter (Julia Ormond) reads aloud from Benjamins diary -- flashing back to his years on a tugboat and that tea-drinking episode with Tilda Swinton. The latter half of the movie loses some of its magic as Benjamin grows younger and his story winds down. The sight of Brad Pitt airbrushed to Thelma amp; Louise perfection is somehow less enchanting than Brad Pitt digitized into crinkly old man. But its still a feat of lush romantic filmcraft twinkling with Claudio Mirandas cinematography and Alexandre Desplats dreamy score. At the end you might yawn and stretch a bit a natural response to a few hours spent in the company of a really fascinating windbag. He blabs on for too long but he tells a darn good story. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Mini Portable Washer and Spin Dryer for 90 + free shipping Unisex Cushioned Arch Supports for 1 + free shipping Vizio 43"" 4K LED UHD Smart TV 150 Dell GC for 400 + free...

Where others are born unformed and unwrinkled Benjamin comes into the world a decrepit old man; where others wither he dies in a pink and creaseless state of infancy. For Benjamin love is inextricable from loss since his path runs counterclockwise to nature. This unsettling melancholy notion is attached by the thinnest thread to its original literary source a 1922 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. But in the hands of director David Fincher and with Brad Pitt as Benjamin this Button is a curious case indeed an extravagantly ambitious movie thats easy to admire but a challenge to love. Perhaps thats how it ought to be. Eric Roths fanciful screenplay makes use of a cheesy Bridges of Madison County structure to frame the mythic saga -- a grown daughter (Julia Ormond) learns her mothers romantic secrets as the old woman lays dying in a New Orleans hospital bed just as Hurricane Katrina is gathering force. The old woman named Daisy is Cate Blanchett after many hours with make-up artists; the secret is that Daisy met Benjamin in Louisiana a lifetime ago when the two were kids and he was old/young and their love went on and on in its fashion. A different director might have emphasized sentimentality in the manner of a Robin Williams weepy with a message Were all going to die so love while you get a chance Instead Finchers innate astringency -- his hardness even which he has put to such varied effect over the years in Fight Club Seven and Zodiac -- becomes exactly the kind of tonic needed to balance the sweet/tart proportions of so audacious a cinematic project. At any moment in this singular Hollywood spectacle two marvels predominate one technical and the other...Bradical. The movie has been in the works for years pored over by Fincher like a favorite fairytale from his childhood. But only now has computer-driven wizardry matured enough to meet the storys challenges so unobtrusively. Likewise Pitt a comely actor is no longer the golden surprise he was 18 years ago in Thelma amp; Louise. What he is though is a phenomenon of heightened celebrity. And that rarified status combined with good grooming and exquisite digital effects care produces the exact force field of fame needed to take our breath away in that first moment on screen when rid of gray hair Benjamin is bathed in light that honors the movie-star beauty Pitt is. Was. Is. In his transient loveliness the stars character is rewarded with the company of an equally radiant woman. Or three. At first when young/old Benjamin is a grotesque-looking abandoned newborn hes taken in by a kindly New Orleans nursing-home attendant (a tender Taraji P. Henson) who loves him as a son. Later before he and Daisy meet up again in adulthood the hero learns about sex and desire from a wise worldly lady (Tilda Swinton never better). By the time his love affair with Daisy crests the pair are equals and as a couple of blooming lovers Blanchetts limpid performance rises up to meet Pitts petal for petal. Yet Fincher has little time for assuring sweetness or audience caresses not when Daisys future is physical decay while Benjamins is mental regression. Calling forth the flood waters of Katrina as a symbol of the inability to stop time is distracting even presumptuous and brutal. Still the point is made Life is a tide a flood even against which youth beauty and even Brad Pitt have no magical powers.

Not just his case though its curious enough - a man is born old and ages backward - but the film as well. Director David Fincher is known for such edgy dark movies as Se7en and Fight Club. Here hes made a Forrest Gump for grown-ups with Brad Pitt as his Tom Hanks a simple decent fellow who forges ahead in life despite obstacles in his path. An unnecessary framing device opens the film A woman (Julia Ormond) sits at her dying mothers bedside in a New Orleans hospital reading the diary of a former lover - Benjamin Button. Outside the window Hurricane Katrina. No half-measures here. Benjamin is born in New Orleans the day the First World War ends. But because hes born old Benjamin is an odd-looking creature. In a panic his father Thomas (Jason Flemyng) drops him off on the doorstep of an old folks home where he is adopted by Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) who works there. The old-looking but young Benjamin finds easy company in the homes residents. One day he meets the granddaughter of one Daisy who will thread in and out of his life as his one true love. Benjamin goes to sea with a drunken captain (Jared Harris) and - getting younger by the day - he embarks on an affair in Russia with a rich woman (Tilda Swinton) leaving Daisy (now played by Cate Blanchett) behind. But he eventually returns to New Orleans and again meets Daisy who is visiting from New York where she is now a dancer. Her free spirit overwhelms Benjamin. Meanwhile his father who has been visiting him dies and leaves Benjamin the button factory he owns. Benjamin later heads to New York to seek out Daisy a quest that will also take him to Paris. Eventually they unite in the middle of their lives heading in opposite directions each toward lifes inevitable conclusion. Its startling to see Pitt become younger even more impossibly handsome. Thanks to digital technology he plays Benjamin throughout the film; its a credit to Fincher and Pitt that the gimmick doesnt draw attention to itself. But although the end of the film is touching Finchers not quite sure how to get there. A young man in an old mans body is more easily imagined than the opposite. Pitt is good as Benjamin but in reality the role is more about playing an emotionally stagnant man at different ages than anything else. Blanchett has the more rewarding if traditional role because Daisy is far less passive about life. And while there are some astonishing set pieces including the buildup to an accident that befalls Daisy too much of Button doesnt quite add up to a fully satisfying whole. A curiosity you might say.

At a certain point in David Finchers sublime romantic epic ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" I just dropped my pen and waited to see what wondrous thing would happen next. It takes a world-class storyteller and a great yarn to rivet your attention for nearly three hours. This very classy old-school movie - employing cutting-edge technology that will make your eyes pop - did it for me. This is the sort of movie where knowing as little as possible in advance pays off great dividends in the end. Just go see it. Brad Pitt never one of my favorite actors is totally winning as Benjamin Button born in 1919 New Orleans. His mother dies in childbirth and the wizened baby resembles a miniature 85-year-old. His horrified father (Jason Flemyng) who will re-enter his life years later abandons Benjamin on the doorstep of an old-age home where kindly Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) adopts him as her own. Benjamins unique curse is that he will age backward over many decades all the way past middle age adulthood and adolescence to babyhood. It certainly challenges Benjamins romance with Daisy the great love of his love played as an adult by a luminous Cate Blanchett. The two meet when both are chronologically 7 although Benjamin resembles a stooped old man in his late 70s. But they can never grow old together. They can only hope to savor a few years in the middle of their lives when their bodies are relatively in synch. The backward-aging premise and little else is taken from a short story of the same name that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in 1922. It has been gorgeously fleshed out by Fincher screenwriter Eric Roth (""Forrest Gump"") and a platoon of extremely gifted individuals both in front of and behind the camera. As with the Candide-like Mr. Gump Mr. Button has a series of picturesque adventures going to sea on a tugboat in his 20s when he resembles a man in his 60s. On shore leave in Russia he is introduced to sex by an older woman (Tilda Swinton) until World World II catches up with Benjamin and the tugs captain (Jared Harris). There are a couple of missed romantic connections between Benjamin and Daisy until they finally hook up in the early 1960s. Astounding digital effects are employed to allow Pitt and Blanchett to play the characters at widely varying ages - and in some scenes Pitts features are digitally grafted onto other performers. This allows Pitt to give a deeply soulful and affecting performance that plays beautifully off his real-life status as Hollywoods epitome of physical perfection. He is perfectly partnered by Blanchett. This is a movie deeply concerned with physical decay death and loss but also the opportunities and challenges they present. Its no accident that many of its scenes are set in an old-age home. Yes its sentimental especially coming from Fincher but nowhere near the schmaltz-fest you might expect from the writer of ""Forrest Gump"" though there are a few Gump-ish aphorisms. Its a very rare movie whose sheer charm craft and powerful emotional undercurrent disarm critical objections. It doesnt really need two framing stories one of them involving far too many scenes with an elderly woman and her daughter during Hurricane Katrina. It doesnt need to be nearly three hours long either. But you could say the same thing about the even longer ""Titanic"" which I still adore. I was going to give ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" 3 1/2 stars on a purely rational basis. But sometimes you just have to go with your heart. Merry Christmas. lou.lumenicknypost.com THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON Christmas treat. Running time 167 minutes. Rated PG-13 (brief war violence sexuality profanity).

Stars Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett and Julia Ormond and Tilda Swinton The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Thursday December 25 A man born in 1918 New Orleans ages backward into the 21st century. Stars Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett and Julia Ormond and Tilda Swinton (Paramount) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Theres a lot of Gump in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This meandering parable about a man born old who ages into adulthood then youth and finally infancy is a film that meditates on love aging death each to its season. Since it was written by the same fellow (Eric Roth) who adapted Forrest Gump Button has many Gump characteristics.Where Forrest had his wandering muse Jenny Benjamin Button ( Brad Pitt) has high-living Daisy ( Cate Blanchett). Where Gump framed its story within Forrests recollections on a Savanna park bench Button narrates his story from a diary read by a daughter ( Julia Ormond) waiting for her aged mother (Blanchett) to die as Hurricane Katrina roars into New Orleans. And where Forrest found that ""Life is like a box of chocolates you never know what youre gonna get"" Button learns that ""You never know whats coming for you.""But director David Fincher and screenwriter Roth venturing far from the plot of F. Scott Fitzgeralds ""Benjamin Button"" short story still cling to the profundity in Fitzgeralds words. A life lived out of order just might be the secret to happiness. Benjamin is born a decrepit little old man. As he grows from a digitally created mini Brad Pitt his posture straightens his hair gains color and with each passing year he is more vigorous.Benjamin is raised by a nurse in a nursing home. As Queenie his ""mom"" Taraji P. Henson is the heart and life of the films first hour passing wisdom on to the little old man she raises among other little old men and women.""We all going the same way"" she teaches. And Benjamin listens.He meets the fair Daisy when shes entirely too young for him but he carries her flame. Years pass she becomes a ballet dancer and he grows more age appropriate. But both have life experience to gather before their ships can stop passing in the night. Benjamin views World War II from the deck of a tugboat and takes up with an older (emotionally) woman the wife of a British spy in Russia played with sympathy and experience by Tilda Swinton. Benjamin learns that age isnt the barrier to accomplishment that we treat it as that for everything there is a season and ""when it comes to the end you have to let go.""Pitt is quite good in the lead even if it does take close to two hours for him to show up in a matinee idol form weve all come to know. Its an underplayed performance nicely pitched against great actresses who give Queenie life-affirming warmth and Daisy vivacious impatience.The fable unfolds in a series of entertaining beautifully shot and occasionally under-lit episodes (a Fincher trademark). But did they really need two hours and 40 minutes to get across what Fitzgerald chewed over in just a few pages? Plan all you want but we dont know where the joy or pain will be until we pop open that box of chocolates.

"Curious Case of Benjamin Button The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; curious-case-of-benjamin-button-the ) Curious Case of Benjamin Button The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli The premise underlying The Curious Case of Benjamin Button might sound more appropriate for a science fiction tale than a meditative drama. Indeed the concept of a man aging backward has formed the basis for more than one sci-fi tinged story - from novels to an animated Star Trek episode - but the source material for this film is a 1922 short written by acclaimed novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. The original ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" functions as little more than an inspiration for this movie which takes the idea and the name and follows a divergent path from the one mapped out by Fitzgerald. David Finchers film is its own entity and despite some minor flaws it is undeniably engrossing and one of the more intriguing and emotionally resonant features of the 2008 holiday season. Chaos theory - the idea that small perturbations in the natural order in one place can cause ripple effects to be felt far and wide - lies at the heart and soul of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The only constant in life is change and it happens whether driven by fate (or kismet) or chance. One delicious vignette provides an explicit example as a car accident results from a series of small seemingly unrelated interim incidents. Remove any one and that accident would not have happened. And take away the accident and the rest of the movie would have moved on a different path toward a alternate ending. Life is like that. We never know whether any given action will vanish like a stone tossed into a pond or whether the ripples of that toss will build into a tsunami. The film takes us on a tour of the 20th century even though it begins in the 21st. It opens in August 2005 in New Orleans with Hurricane Katrina bearing down on the Louisiana city. Lying on her deathbed is an 80-year woman named Daisy (Cate Blanchett) who is being attended by her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond). To pass the time Caroline reads from the diary of a man named Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) whose life repeatedly intersected with and diverged from that of her mother. When there are gaps in the story Daisy summons enough energy and breath to fill them in. When Benjamin is born in 1918 he is effectively an old man - the size of a baby but afflicted with all of the problems of the aged. The birth kills Benjamins mother and unable to cope with his sons monstrous appearance Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng) abandons him. Benjamin is found and raised by Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). By the time he is five or six he has grown enough to appear like a stooped old man of about 80. And with each passing year he becomes younger. His path first crosses Daisys when he is 13 and he confesses to her that he is younger than he looks. She will become the love of his life but it will be decades before they find each other. If theres a Forrest Gump quality to the movie thats unsurprising considering that the screenwriter Eric Roth was responsible for both scripts. Like Forrest Benjamin is an outcast of society and history marches by him in a series of vignettes. But director David Finchers darker side is in evidence. Benjamin does not share Forrests charmed existence. For him life is not a box of chocolates and Jenny does not lie at the end of the rainbow. The ending of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button may feel a little rushed but it is also elegiac. Many may see this as a more grown-up version of Forrest Gump but it feels to me like something from the pen of Charlie Kaufman who enjoys playing with time and conventions in much the way Fincher and Roth do here. The film is structured to comprise three major segments. The first represents Benjamins childhood when his seemingly failing physical appearance is belied by his increasing mental agility. For someone with his disability he is surprisingly well adjusted but some of that comes from having a loving mother. The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons second act occurs just before during and after World War II. Thats when the main character enters into an affair with a middle-aged British woman (Tilda Swinton) in Russia serves aboard a tugboat during the conflict and returns home looking more hale and healthy than when he left. Finally the third piece of the puzzle follows Benjamin from middle age into his golden years when he learns a few things about sacrifice and redefining life and happiness. For the most part the acting is of the highest quality with supporting performers like Tilda Swinton Jared Harris (as the captain of the tugboat aboard which Benjamin finds service) and Julia Ormond making the most of limited screen time. Cate Blanchett brings vibrancy and spirit to Daisy. Brad Pitt however is marginally less successful. His portrayal is solid but lacks the extra element necessary to catapult it into greatness. When Benjamin looks old Pitt plays him as old not as a young man trapped in a much older body. And when Benjamin looks young Pitt plays him with the verve of a young man not as an ""old soul."" The subtleties are missing and this may be the single element that could make it difficult for some to accept the premise. As far as that is concerned either you believe Benjamins situation or you dont. The screenplay attempts to provide a little grounding for the reverse aging but its not especially convincing. As a result The Curious Case of Benjamin Button must be viewed on its own terms as a fairy tale or it utterly fails. One thing that helps is the movies amazing attention to period detail. During the 1920s it feels like the post-WWI flapper era. The Great Depression World War II and the Cold War times are all effectively reconstructed and special effects are used to enhance the visual experience not to detract from it by overwhelming the viewer. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is every bit as impressive to look at as the summer blockbusters but theres a real story to go along with the pretty images and potent atmosphere. Although the movie is presented as a series of vignettes its full impact is not felt until the whole is absorbed. Even the 2005 scenes with Caroline by her mothers bedside feed into what Fincher and Roth are saying about chaos theory fate and the sometimes unforgiving jolts imparted by change. In the end Benjamins reverse-aging is just a filter that allows us to gain a slightly skewed perception about the process of living and perhaps by looking through that glass darkly a better understanding of human nature. Is that too much for a mainstream movie to achieve? Perhaps and Im not sure The Curious Case of Benjamin Button takes us as far down that path as it might hope to. But theres no denying the films power of compulsion and the sense that when its all over it means something. Most viewers will be entertained and moved and some will find their intellect aroused. The source material may be F. Scott Fitzgerald but The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has come a long way from where it started 86 years ago.

(Photo Francois Duhamel/Courtesy of Dreamworks) The really poetic weirdness though comes in a pair of encounters with Michael Shannon as John the deinstitutionalized son of the Wheelers realtor (Kathy Bates) who bonds with April over her alienation. Shannon is too large for the spaceFrankensteins monster in an ill-fitting suit whose movements (post-electroshock) are out of joint who sees malignancy and self-deceit wherever he looks. The conception is dated By virtue of his mental illness Johnthe nut who comes to dinnerperceives truth more clearly than the sane characters. (Yates doesnt go so far as to suggest like R. D. Laing that madness is the true sanity but theyre in the same ballpark.) Yet theres nothing musty about Shannons performance. In Bug he played (to the hilt) a delusional paranoiac but his John has a different vibeacid wires humming ripping off other peoples scabs to keep from ripping into his own. His scenes are sick-comic showstoppers but not so hilarious you cant see what hes doing torpedoing whats left of the cruise ship. The protagonist of the leisurely romantic fable The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is born old and wrinkled and ages backward which means we spend an hour and a half waiting eagerly for Brad Pitt to look like Brad Pitti.e. superhumanly prettyand the next hour and change thinking Is that all there is? Not much goes on in that face and Pitts resemblance to Robert Redfordpouchy cheeks quizzical half-open mouthtends to underscore whats absent. Redford in his prime was alert and prickly perpetually dissatisfied whereas Pitt exudes complacency. As Benjamin whose heavily symbolic malady has something to do with a supernatural clock designed by a grieving father to move in reverse he gives you no hint what his character makes of the changes. He doesnt bring out the tension between mind and body; he just stares ahead with sad eyes and lets his makeup do the acting. Pitt isnt bad (his noncommittal performance might even appeal to some people who can project on him what they will) but he lets opportunities slide that other physically inventive performers would kill for. The movie directed by David Fincher will probably be a hit anyway because the gimmick (adapted by Eric Roth from an F. Scott Fitzgerald story) is fun to play around with in your head and because its liberating to watch makeup gradually come off an actor instead of getting thicker (and phonier). Fitzgerald spent the later years of his life haunted by the profligacy of his early ones; to reverse time and recover his youthful body and stamina but retain his aged wisdom must have been a blessed pipe dream. Fincher is no humanist (his most vivid film is the clammy clinical Se7en) and he refrains from milking the material for sentimentwhich means the movie isnt mawkish but it isnt especially vivid either. The light is yellowish and diffuse the backdropsthe clock a factory wall the side of a shipoversize. Its a gentle expressionism redolent of death without rattling bones. Fitzgeralds alter-ego finds his Zeldacalled aptly enough Daisywhen she visits the convalescent home where his horrified father abandoned him. She grows up to be Cate Blanchett whose face is uncannily ivory-smooth. When Daisy and Benjamin meet in the middle both at the peak of their physical perfection theyre like two Greek statues basking in each others radiance albeit with dialogue that knocks them down a few pegs I was thinkin that nothing lasts and what a shame that is. As they move toward death one in the direction of infancy and dirty diapers and the other toward old age and osteoporosis The Curious Case of Benjamin Button attains a level of quiet grace. Its too bad that I can barely remember the movie after only a week. Nothing lasts indeed. The remake of that fine old fifties alien-invasion picture The Day the Earth Stood Stilla peacenik rejoinder to all the sci-fi movies in which E.T.s stood in for soul-sapping Commiescomes to a standstill about an hour before the Earth does in the wilds of New Jersey. Trust me folks Jersey turns out to be the ultimate momentum killer The main characters among them renowned scientist Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) and an alien Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) speed toward the Lincoln Tunneland yet as in a bad dream the tunnel seems to get farther and farther away. Just when we think theyre going to make it they pull into a McDonalds. Then they take a detour to talk philosophy with Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese) who lives deep in the Jersey woods. Meanwhile the excellent-looking giant robot Gort seemingly on the brink of going Godzilla on Manhattan transforms into an unphotogenic swarm of CGI bugs and annihilates Giants Stadium. Atop their tanks in the city members of various government forces look at their watches and noisily exhale. Next Doubt Previous 1 2 3 4 5 Next Share this story...

David Finchers haunting and uneven picaresque fable is a radical reimagining of a fanciful minor F. Scott Fitzgerald short story. It tells the tall tale of an infant who is born as an old man--tiny but suffering all the infirmities of an 80-year-old--who lives his life in reverse becoming younger with each passing year until he achieves real infancy at the end of his life.Benjamin (Brad Pitt) gets his last name from his button-manufacturing father (Jason Flemyng) who horrified by the sight of his bizarre baby abandons him on the steps of a New Orleans old-age home where he is raised by the loving black employee Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). He may only be a toddler but he feels right at home among the old folks being a balding child who wears glasses and is confined to a wheelchair. At this stage of the story its only Pitts heavily made-up head were seeing (digitally imposed on other bodies); it will be a while before he begins to resemble the matinee idol we know.Pitts Benjamin with a lazy Southern accent narrates this two-hour-and-40-minute tale. If his ruminations evoke distant echoes of ""Forrest Gump"" its because Eric Roth wrote both screenplays. ""Button"" is among other things a love story but its in no hurry to let you know it. Indeed for more than an hour--from the end of World War I to the outbreak of World War II--Fincher meanders without ever achieving total traction. He keeps returning to the present-day less-than-inspired framing device in which an old woman dying in a New Orleans hospital as Hurricane Katrina approaches listens to her daughter (Julia Ormond) read Benjamins journals. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week And a long and winding tale it is. Along the way one has to put up with some tiresome adventures as the teenage Benjamin (who looks to be in his late 60s) sets sail with a drunken old tugboat captain (a blustery scenery-chewing Jared Harris). But then with the arrival of Tilda Swinton as a married upper-class Englishwoman the movie snaps to life. She seduces Benjamin in a wintry Russian hotel and the movie seems to shift from the elegiac past tense to a vivid present. Not coincidentally its the first time Pitt is fully recognizable he gets to act with his whole body. The great love of Benjamins life however is not Swintons Englishwoman. Its the little girl Alice whom he meets as a child in New Orleans and who grows up to be a headstrong ballet dancer played by Cate Blanchett. Benjamin now looking merely middle-aged re-encounters her in New York where she is hanging with a bohemian crowd and gushing about Agnes de Mille.The poignance of this love story lies in its impossibility. She will grow older as he grows younger; their daughter will grow up as he returns to childhood. Only for one magical moment will these lovers share the same age. Yet for all of Finchers formidable filmmaking--this is one gorgeously shot and designed movie--I was never convinced that the spoiled sometimes abrasive Alice and the gentle philosophical Benjamin were a good romantic fit. As compelling as Blanchett and Pitt are--he gives one of the subtlest most touching performances of his career--their characters dont quite mesh here.In another movie this would be a fatal flaw yet the overall impact of ""Benjamin Button"" is greater than the sum of its parts. The metaphor of a life lived backward is strangely haunting. Benjamins saga is singular yet universal anyone who has contemplated his own mortality will find it hard not to be moved by Finchers evocation of the fickleness of fate. Lyrical original misshapen and deeply felt this is one flawed beauty of a movie.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" represents a richly satisfying serving of deep-dish Hollywood storytelling. This odd epic tale of a man who ages backwards is presented in an impeccable classical manner every detail tended to with fastidious devotion. An example of the most advanced technology placed entirely at the service of story and character this significant change-of-pace from director David Fincher poses some daunting marketing challenges even with Brad Pitt atop the cast. Strong critical support will be needed to swell interest in this absorbing even moving but emotionally cool film which is simultaneously accessible and distinctive enough to catch on with a large public if luck and the zeitgeist are with it. Due to its history-spanning structure blank-page title character and technical sleight of hand the film ""Benjamin Button"" most recalls is ""Forrest Gump"" but in a good way; it is entirely possible to dislike the 1994 smash and embrace this one which resists every opportunity for mawkish and sentimental displays. Still it is no coincidence that Eric Roth wrote both of them and Roth -- who followed many other writers including credited co-story author Robin Swicord in trying to crack the long-gestating project -- has veered far from the specifics of F. Scott Fitzgeralds 1921 short story. Fitzgeralds original was inspired by a Mark Twain observation to the effect that its a pity the best part of life comes at the beginning and the worst part at the end. Yarn began in 1860 Baltimore had Benjamin born looking like a 70-year-old man raised by his father marrying and having a son starring for Harvard in football and ending his life by attending kindergarten with his own grandson. Using precious little of the story save the central aging conceit Roths version ranges from World War I into the 21st century and creatively uses New Orleans as its base with sojourns to distant corners of the globe. Scripter could have chosen to make the central figure a more exceptional active character -- a doer of great things or an intellectual with an acute awareness of his unique condition. Instead Benjamin is a passive sort to whom things happen a trait by no means an impediment to audience involvement. Gump was like that as were Dr. Zhivago and others. Fincher spends 13 minutes short of three hours telling this unique mans life story and the time goes by easily with no sense of dawdling waste or indulgence. The film evinces a sure hand that maintains narrative confidence steadiness of tone and a mature awareness of the temporal nature of lifes opportunities and the fleeting quality of happiness. Death pervades the film and Benjamins life but in a matter-of-fact rather than depressing way; if youre raised among oldsters in a retirement home death is never a stranger. Framing story is set in a modern hospital room where the fading Daisy (a recognizable Cate Blanchett under heavy makeup) has her 40ish daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) read to her from the diary of her late dear friend Benjamin. Benjamin is born of the armistice and is lovingly raised by a black attendant Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) at the rest home. An establishment awash in the gentility of the Old South the place is ideal for a child who with his bald pate cataracts deficient hearing and need for a wheelchair fits right in with the other occupants. When hes 12 and looks about 70 Benjamin meets a residents lovely red-haired granddaughter Daisy. No doubt named in homage to the immortal heroine of Fitzgeralds ""The Great Gatsby"" Daisy will zig-zag in and out of his life from then on and eventually embody his emotional touchstone. With a solicitous stranger he doesnt know is actually his father (Jason Flemyng) as well as with an African pygmy bon vivant (Rampai Mohadi) Benjamin gets a taste of the outside world including the pleasures of the flesh at a bordello. He also befriends hard-drinking tugboat captain Mike (Jared Harris) and in time-honored tradition for a young man goes to sea. In one of the films most bewitching interludes Benjamin who has begun to realize hes looking younger has an affair in Murmansk with the sophisticated Elizabeth (Tilda Swinton) from whom he learns what it is to be loved and desired. Pics action highlight is a startling nocturnal encounter between the tug and a Nazi U-boat that has just sunk a troop transport. Safely back in New Orleans after the war Benjamin becomes reacquainted with Daisy now a rising dancer and unashamed sensualist who comes on a little strong for her old friend. But after his father dies leaving him his button factory and entire estate Benjamin follows Daisy to New York where he sees her dancing the ballet in ""Carousel"" then to Paris only to continue being rejected by the headstrong young woman even after she suffers a terrible tragedy detailed in a suspense montage that by itself reps a dazzling display of directorial savoir faire. Much of the films romantic and philosophical posture hinges on Benjamin and Daisy getting together at the right time and they do so in an entirely satisfying way; by the time of consummation with Brad Pitt now in full physical glory and Blanchett at her womanly peak they -- and the audience -- are more than ready for it. But their passion is all the more pointedly ephemeral due to the consciousness of being headed in opposite physical directions. The necessary acceptance of this fact produces a sincerely and genuinely earned sense of melancholy about the transitive nature of love and life. The extent to which Fincher and his vast team of collaborators have succeeded in their storytelling can be seen by the fact that one comes out of the film thinking about the characters and narrative intent not the admittedly amazing aging effects and other technical achievements. Truly the visions of Benjamin and other central characters at different ages are sights to behold; baby Ben resembling a little E.T. Blanchett appearing a convincing 23. But truly the most unnerving image is Pitt looking more or less the way he did in ""Thelma and Louise"" or at least half the age of the man now playing the character. Clearly anything is possible. In all his physical manifestations Benjamin is a reactor not a perpetrator and Pitt inhabits the role genially gently and sympathetically. Blanchetts Daisy is the more volatile and moody one and after bluntly revealing the selfish impetuousness of Daisys youthful self the thesp fully registers both the passion and insecurity of the mature woman. Henson as Benjamins surrogate mother and Swinton as the calculating adulteress are wonderful and Harris and Mohadi etch particularly colorful supporting turns as two of Benjamins rowdier cohorts. Every scene is crammed with detail from the nooks and crannies of the settings created by production designer Donald Graham Burt and the century-bridging costumes by Jacqueline West to the faces of the main cast and countless extras. Alexandre Desplats score provides lovely and unobtrusive dramatic support. Fincher and lenser Claudio Miranda shoot mostly in deep focus images to maximize the information in every frame and the depth of the blacks they achieve shooting on digital is extraordinary. Still for what is designed as a rich tapestry the picture maintains a slightly remote feel. No matter the power of the image of an old but young-looking Benjamin slumped over a piano and depressed about his fading memory and life; it is possible that the picture might have been warmer and more emotionally accessible had it been shot on film. It has been argued that digital is a cold medium and celluloid a hot one and a case however speculative could be made that a story such as ""Benjamin Button"" with its desired cumulative emotional impact should be shot and screened on film to be fully realized. These are intangibles but nor are they imaginary factors; what technology gives it can also take away. The Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonProductionA Paramount (in U.S.)/Warner Bros.

Susu says December 29 2014 at 1101 am Brad Pitt is not just another handsome guy whos made it big in film. This guy is one hell of an actor wholl walk away with this years Best Actor Oscar as will the movie garner 10 awards. It is simply a masterpiece; no words can aptly decribe the poignancy and beauty of this celluloid Renoir. Kudos to two geniuses who wrote it;Eric Roth and Robin Swicordmasters of imagination. To think of the idea whereby the march of time runs clockwise for the entire world but backwards for Benjamin is in itself masterful. The concept allows for the type of intersection of people and events which has never been shown on the screen previously. I suggest that no one reads anything about the plot because the entire impact of the film will be lost by doing so. See it with an open mind and you will be totally astounded for close to three hours. Every once in a while a film of this brilliance comes along to take the public by storm the last being ""Million Dollar Baby"" therefore get set for another movie treat of a lifetime.
