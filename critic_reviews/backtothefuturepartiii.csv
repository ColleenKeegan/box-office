"1990s Back to the Future III review praises film as a genial tidy finale - LA Times HERO COMPLEX ENTERTAINMENT HERO COMPLEX From the Archives 1990s Back to the Future III review praises film as a genial tidy finale Back to the Future III Universal Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox in a scene from 1990s ""Back to the Future Part III."" Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox in a scene from 1990s ""Back to the Future Part III."" (Universal) Peter Rainer Editors note Celebrate Back to the Future Day with a look back at the conclusion of the ""Back to the Future"" franchise. Los Angeles Times writer Peter Rainer called the third film ""sprightly and inoffensive"" even though it didnt really have a reason to exist at all besides money. Fair. Heres the full review published on May 25 1990 with the headline ""Movie Review Back to the Future Genial Tidy Finale."" Time-travel scenarios almost always work in the movies no matter how clumsily executed. In the case of the 1985 ""Back to the Future"" no excuses were in order. The film was a highly inventive nonstop dither of time-warp confusion and in Marty McFlys rush to unite his parents-to-be it even had a mite of ""heart.""""Back to the Future Part II"" extended the storyline of its predecessor without adding much to its inventiveness. It wasnt as bad as most people said it was at the time--it had pace and wit--but it didnt really need to be made either. The third installment ""Back to the Future Part III"" (citywide) was filmed on the heels of ""Part II"" and it too has no particular reason for being (except of course to complete the series and cash in). Its sprightly and inoffensive though. And for those who care it satisfyingly ties up the various plot strands that were flapping in the breeze from the last installment. ""Back to the Future"" futurists will feel complete.This time around director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriter Robert Gale indulge their love of Westerns. (Its that love that must have kept them interested in the project.) Through a series of blissfully nutty schemes Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels back to the Old West circa 1885 to try and rescue Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) before he is shot in the back by Hill Valleys chief lout Buford (Mad Dog) Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) an ancestor of Martys 20th-Century rival Biff Tannen.Duded up in bargain-bin cowboy attire calling himself ""Clint Eastwood"" Marty reunites with Doc who is posing as a blacksmith. (Doc said in Part II that he always wanted to live in the Old West.) Unlike the first two films this new one once it settles into the past is essentially devoted to Doc. Hes smitten by an equally smitten schoolmarm (Mary Steenburgen) and the question arises Will he be able to leave her and zip back to the future?In its emphasis on Doc ""Part III"" (rated PG) is a bit like an episode of some long-running TV show that gives over an entire segment to one of its character actors. Theres a pleasing humility in the way Fox hands the movie over to Lloyd. Or is it just that Fox has become tired of scampering around like some overage-underage hellion? Martys wind-up-toy athleticism has wound down and thats something of a relief. Fox has grown as an actor since he started this series and it may be that particularly after ""Casualties of War"" he cant quite find it in himself to careen about with the same cartoonish abandon. Christopher Lloyd on the other hand appears to regard his role as a kind of actors redemption. With his great shock of white hair and his rubbery permanently agape features Doc still looks like a Kabuki mad scientist. But his love for Steenburgens Clara humanizes him; when hes alone with her or dancing with her Doc is happily flummoxed by his own capacity for tenderness. He cant quite get a fix on his romantic delirium and he kind of likes the idea that he cant explain his bliss. Its a good joke The mad scientist seeking to explain the unknowable comes face to face with the universes ultimate mystery women.Steenburgen is such an entrancing presence with her own slightly out-of-time spaciness that she keeps Claras scenes with Doc from becoming blubbery. She really is Docs soulmate; their mutual love of Jules Verne is their touchstone. Its regrettable that Zemeckis doesnt give over more of his movie to this couples lyrical clownishness. Marty may have cooled off but Zemeckis is still hot-footed; even though Part III is a more spacious and gentle entertainment than its predecessor it doesnt slow down for the emotional moments. It doesnt quite give these balmy lovers their due.Zemeckis may think hes still working with the cartoon characters from ""Roger Rabbit"" and in a sense he is. But the cartoon inventiveness of his best work doesnt have a chance to function in this Western setting. The filmmakers may love the idea of making a Western--even a mock-satirical one--but they dont provide enough gags at the genres expense. They may be too awed by the form to make a satisfying joke out of it. (Parts of the film were shot in Monument Valley John Ford country.)Foxs pint-size feistiness is used to comic advantage in a barroom brawl scene and he gets to do a funny moon dance when Mad Dog shoots at his feet but too much is made of the Clint Eastwood connection and the overweening chumminess of it is a bit obnoxious. (Eastwood is given a ""thank you"" in the end credits.)Besides the Western is a dead genre for the mostly young audience that will see this film so most of the in-jokes will be exclusionary--private jokes. (Kids who see the film arent likely to clamor for more Westerns.) Then again the entire film (rated PG) is inlaid with in-jokes to the two previous films in the series. Is all this self-congratulation a matter of pride or a sign of creative exhaustion? A little of both I think.

WilsonElisabeth Shue Mary Steenburgen Lea Thompson Thomas F. WilsonUniversal D+ Back to the Future Part III Genre Western Comedy Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Michael J. Fox Christopher Lloyd Elisabeth Shue Mary Steenburgen Lea Thompson Thomas F. Wilson; Director Robert Zemeckis; Author Bob Gale; Producer (person) Steven Spielberg; Runtime (in minutes) 118; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Universal Posted June 1 1990 -- 1200 AM EDT The makers of Back to the Future Part III must have been exhausted by all that hurtling back and forth along the space-time continuum that Michael J. Fox did in Back to the Future Part II. (If only hed been racking up frequent-flier mileage) In Part III they simply plop down Marty McFly (Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in the Old West and leave them there. This last installment in the series is also the first dud. More than anything it recalls those campy 60s sitcoms that always featured an Old West episode -- you know a character would get conked on the head the story would turn into a dream sequence in 10-gallon hats and the whole thing would be filmed on generic Western sets. Back to the Future Part III has that same sort of studio back-lot clunkiness. Only this time its the audience that gets conked -- by the sheer desperation of the whole enterprise. Writer-producer Bob Gale and director Robert Zemeckis trot out all the frontier cliches. Cowboys gallop through Monument Valley to the beat of thumping Ponderosa music. The bullying Biff Tannen (Thomas F.Wilson) shows up as a distant ancestor ""Mad Dog"" Tannen a black-hatted gunslinger who fires bullets at Martys feet to make him dance. The climactic shoot-out is a dim parody of spaghetti Westerns. Meanwhile the plot hinges on how to get the DeLorean time machine back to 1985 without the aid of gasoline. What a hip and funny invention that magical sports car seemed in the first movie and what a laborious device it has become.Part III opens with a 10-minute onslaught of Doc Browns ranting metaphysics. Throughout the film he keeps shouting ""Great Scott"" and launching into another soliloquy. Hes like a speed freak reading from a physics textbook. Its just about impossible to decipher what hes saying or to care. Part II was crammed with so much manic invention that it was like a roller coaster that wouldnt stop. Zemeckis certainly held your attention but in an aggressive pointless way. Gone was the soul the cross-generational emotionalism that made the first movie a pop classic. In Part III Zemeckis continues his transition from moviemaker to glorified mechanic. Theres hardly a spark of life left in this material (its just a compendium of gimmickry now) yet Zemeckis and his executive producer Steven Spielberg seem content to trivialize their own accomplishment. The fact that they shot II and III back-to-back was widely publicized. Now that III has arrived its obvious that they put their passion into the heady money-saving logistics of filming two episodes in rapid-fire succession. Theyve turned the Back to the Future series into a marketing blitzkrieg releasing this installment less than a year after the previous one and bringing Part II out on videocassette a day before Part III hit the theaters. Spielberg and Zemeckis may be marketing geniuses but its hard to believe todays young audiences will want to sit through a blandly synthetic Western parody. Back to the Future Part III might have worked had Zemeckis mixed up the present and the past more injecting futuristic elements into the antiquated setting and turning the whole movie into a delirious sci-fi hodgepodge. On the few occasions he tries this sort of thing -- the flying hoverboard from Part II makes a crucial reappearance -- the results are amusing. But the only true surprise of this movie is how lazy it is. This time Marty is more of a bystander. The story centers on Doc Brown -- a crucial mistake considering that Lloyd a very funny character actor is best in small doses and that Michael J. Foxs crack timing is one of the strongest elements in the series. Doc falls in love with a pretty schoolmarm (Mary Steenburgen) who shares his passion for Jules Verne; its a romance of eggheads. At the same time hes desperately trying to prevent himself from being shot and killed. Marty and Doc you see have stumbled upon a tombstone that features the exact date of Docs death. Unless they can change the course of history Doc has less than a week to live. The time-travel logic seems shakier than ever. After all if Doc (as it stands now) died in 1885 then how could he have invented the time machine that first brought him back to 1885? And how could Marty have joined him? Oh well -- the Planet of the Apes sequels never made much sense either. Here though Zemeckis slipshod plotting results not just from carelessness but from his trying to wrap up the series with an upbeat message. For all its screwball buoyancy the original Back to the Future was rigorously deterministic. It held fast to the idea that one tiny event could alter your destiny for better or worse. Part III is full of sappy homilies about how ""the future is what you make it"" -- i.e. regardless of the past if you just work hard enough to change things everything will turn out fine. At one point Doc exasperated by all the trouble his DeLorean has gotten him into talks about how he wants to ""destroy that infernal machine."" Traveling through time he says ""has become much too painful."" At this point many in the audience may well agree.

Back to the Future Part III recovers the style wit and grandiose fantasy elements of the original. The simplicity of plot and the wide expansiveness of its use of space are a refreshing change from the convoluted visually cramped and cluttered second part. Michael J. Foxs Marty McFly in his time-travelling DeLorean finds himself in the midst of a band of charging Indians in John Ford country Monument Valley 1885. His mission is to bring back Doc (Christopher Lloyd) before he is shot in the back by Thomas F. Wilsons hilariously unhinged Buford Mad Dog Tannen an ancestor of McFlys 20th century nemesis Biff Tannen. Fox steps into the background of the story and lets Lloyd have the chance to play the romantic lead for a change. Docs offbeat romance with Mary Steenburgens Clara Clayton a spinster schoolmarm who shares his passion for Jules Verne is funny touching and exhilarating. Their ultimate journey through time gives the plot trajectory an unexpected and entirely satisfying resolution. The fun of this meta-Western is partly the recognition of elements familiar from genre classics the dance from My Darling Clementine the sobering-up concoction from El Dorado the costume from Fistful of Dollars. Fox reexperiences all this literally flying through the screen (at an incongruous Monument Valley drive-in) into every Western fans dream of being a character in a real Western.

Comments Back to the Future Part III Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd go on their third journey through time this one winding up in the wild west where Lloyd falls in love with schoolteacher Mary Steenburgen. Once again Robert Zemeckis directed from a script he did with Bob Gale and again Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson costar. This is a good deal more likable than part two because the product plugs have been held back and Zemeckis is clearly having fun alluding to his favorite westerns; theres also a certain sweetness and charm in the Lloyd-Steenburgen romance although like most elements in this trilogy these qualities tend to be more conceptual and programmed than felt.

Baggage is always being sent on to the wrong epoch and return tickets are never guaranteed. Doc Browns DeLorean the vehicle of choice in Back to the Future (1985) and Back to the Future Part II released last November has zoomed around from 1985 to 1955 to 2015 and back again. Now in Back to the Future Part III (which might as accurately be called Back to the Future Part II 2) the DeLorean has somehow transported Doc the deliriously manic scientist played by Christopher Lloyd to the slightly Wild West of 1885. Meanwhile his pal Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) who is in 1955 (or is it 1985? Its not always clear) finds a newspaper item reporting Docs death on Sept. 7 1885. The only thing a pal can do is go back to 1885 and warn Doc about his impending demise. Thus possibly Marty can change the future from which he has taken temporary leave. Am I going too fast? Robert Zemeckis the director and Bob Gale the writer clearly relish these compounding conundrums of time though in their new film the conundrums are not as prominently featured as the comic western that the time machine makes possible. The producers swear that Back to the Future Part III is the end of what they modestly call their trilogy but the new movie which was shot back-to-back with Part II looks as if it could be the beginning of a continuing television series. Dont worry that the trusty DeLorean is last seen in Part III in pieces the size of microchips. Total destruction of the monster never fazed the producers of succeeding Frankenstein movies. Considering the possibilities of the era Part III has an astonishingly small story which is supplemented by a number of gags that are more cheerful than laugh-provoking. Its quite nice seeing Hill City the principal location of the two earlier films as it might have looked 105 years ago a frontier town with a Western saloon a courthouse under construction a schoolmarm (Mary Steenburgen) and the first McFlys newly arrived from Ireland. When Marty meets his own great-great-grandfather (also played by Mr. Fox) he avoids confusion by adopting a fake name Clint Eastwood. Martys 20th-century Hill City nemesis Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) turns up as Biffs look-alike forebear nicknamed Mad Dog Tannen because of his temper and tendency to drool. When Marty tries to avoid a shootout with Mad Dog it provides an opportunity for someone to say If you dont go out there everybody will say that Clint Eastwood is the biggest yellow-belly in the West. That line locates the films funnybone. Though Mr. Fox is still the nominal star of Back to the Future Part III the film is fueled mainly by Mr. Lloyd his wild mop of white hair and his intense lunatic optimism. This time around Doc also has a love-interest Clara the schoolteacher played by Miss Steenburgen. The roles arent exactly overwritten but Mr. Lloyd and Miss Steenburgen share a kind of loose-cannon craziness that works well for the movie. Among other things Back to the Future Part III may be the first and last movie in which Miss Steenburgen gets a chance to hang upside down on the side of a speeding steam engine. She does it well. Another key sequence is set in the Monument Valley associated with the cinema of John Ford. The locale is treated with respect. Respect in fact may be what Back to the Future Part III has too much of. Except for Mr. Lloyd the film is so sweet-natured and bland that it is almost instantly forgettable. Back to the Future Part III which has been rated PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) includes some mildly vulgar language.

"Back to the Future Part III Related Item Go to Video Finder Back to the Future Part III By Hal Hinson Washington Post Staff Writer May 25 1990 Director Robert Zemeckis Cast Michael J. Fox; Christopher Lloyd; Mary Steenburgen; Lea Thompson; Thomas F. Wilson; Elisabeth Shue; Charles Fleischer Parental guidance suggested Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa ""Back to the Future Part III"" the third and final installment in the time-travel adventures of Marty McFly is a winge`d thing full of ingenious pop dazzle and jazzy high spirits. From its opening shots the film is like an invigorating elixir a movie pick-me-up that delivers thrills and races your pulse but keeps your head in gear too. Its divinely frivolous nearly perfect fun.The story line -- which director Robert Zemeckis worked out with his partner Bob Gale -- is gorgeously tangled and the director sets it all up as if his pants were on fire. Even before the credits have rolled our heads are spinning. The situation at the outset is this Its 1955 and as the clock approaches the crucial moment Doc (Christopher Lloyd) packs Marty (Michael J. Fox) into his DeLorean and sends him back to the future. BUT ... before the smoke clears Marty trots up claiming that hes back from the future this time with a telegram from the other Doc -- the one stranded in 1885 at the end of ""BTTF II"" -- detailing where the damaged time machine can be found and how it can be repaired.As far as Doc is concerned the machine is to be used once more to take Marty back to 1985; in fact he goes to great pains to insist that no one come to rescue him in 1885 where he is living a happy life as a blacksmith. But when a tombstone is discovered showing that unless something is done Doc will be shot in the back in less than a week Marty is left with no alternative but to fire up the DeLorean and once again head back into the past to rescue him.No one is expected to swallow these mazelike twists and double-back detours all in one gulp. The more you hang on to the pieces of the puzzle though the more pleasurable it is. When Marty crosses the plane of the fourth dimension and moves into the past the picture becomes a kind of surrealistic western. The Hill Valley of 1885 is a woolly Wild West outpost with a saloon (which occupies the same spot as the soda shop and its later incarnations) and a sheriff (played hilariously as a Buffalo Bill look-alike by James Tolkan) and a town bad guy who turns out to be ""Mad Dog"" Tannen the ancient ancestor of the obnoxious Biff (played again by Thomas F. Wilson) from ""I"" and ""II.""The filmmakers work hilarious variations on the cliches of the western genre. Some of the bits come blissfully out of nowhere. The best riffs though are at the expense of Clint Eastwood whose name Marty takes to disguise his true identity from the members of his own McFly clan. (Theres a delightful scene in which Marty gets to hold a tiny infant who is in fact his own great-grandfather.) This brand of droll kinetic humor is a Zemeckis and Gale trademark. The gags in ""BTTF III"" mark a new high for pop inventiveness. The jokes here are intricately constructed and precision-timed like the Rube Goldberg gadget Doc constructs to produce a single ice cube (more precious than gold in the dusty Old West). The filmmakers are movie smart too and because theyre constantly playing around with time -- and with our knowledge of what happened in the earlier movies -- their punch lines almost always work on more than one level.Seamlessly efficient the movie almost never lets up. Because Marty has ruptured the gas line on the DeLorean spilling out all the gas and making it impossible for them to cross time zones Doc is forced to devise an elaborate scheme using a locomotive to push the car up to speed. The film builds up a head of steam too and the momentum is dizzying. The conclusion is basic in design as classic as a silent movie heroine inching toward a buzz saw but its a masterfully executed bit of pure cinema.But headlong velocity for its own sake isnt the filmmakers only concern. The picture isnt nerve-jarring and frenetic the way the previous two were. It doesnt slam forward mindlessly; it pauses occasionally to allow the characters to interact. Theres even a place it seems for a lyrical moment or two for sweetness and romance.As a result this is the most human the most character-based of the ""Back to the Future"" films. Whereas before Marty has been the front man the focus here is more on Lloyds Doc. As an actor Lloyd is an extravagant eccentric an American version of Ralph Richardson but with just the slightest touch of acid damage. Spiritually Lloyd is as close as a living person can come to being a cartoon and in the past Ive felt pushed back against a wall by his aggressively animated style. But here his playing seems more modulated less strained; this time hes left room on screen for the other actors.It would have been inconceivable before for Doc to have fallen in love; it wasnt within the characters range or the movies really. But that he falls in love -- and not only that cuts an almost dashing romantic figure -- is an indication of how much the filmmakers have opened up their premise. His inamorata here is Clara (Mary Steenburgen) a doelike schoolmarm newly arrived in town. From the moment their eyes meet theyre smitten. The romance isnt allowed much screen time but the conversations they have about their love for Jules Verne give the film a science fiction context the other pictures lacked plus a blossoming innocence.Its wonderful to see Steenburgen get this kind of comic showcase. Her presence has a leavening effect; she gives the movie a touch of twitterpated elegance. As for the rest of the regulars everybody is better this time out Fox included. By now Fox must be entirely bored with the series commonplace hero; theres not much in the writing for an actor to latch on to. But theres something about Foxs averageness that takes hold in this installment. Hes such an unspectacular kid so normal and like every other Valley Boy that his lack of stature -- especially when he straightens his Eastwood poncho and hat and heads for his showdown on main street -- is itself heroic.When Verne is evoked you immediately nod. ""BTTF III"" has the expansiveness of a classic fantasy; its a big sprawling adventure full of wonderments and rich surprises. Not only is it junk transformed its junk redeemed.

WilsonElisabeth Shue Mary Steenburgen Lea Thompson Thomas F. WilsonUniversal D+ Back to the Future Part III Genre Western Comedy Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Michael J. Fox Christopher Lloyd Elisabeth Shue Mary Steenburgen Lea Thompson Thomas F. Wilson; Director Robert Zemeckis; Author Bob Gale; Producer (person) Steven Spielberg; Runtime (in minutes) 118; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Universal Posted June 1 1990 -- 1200 AM EDT The makers of Back to the Future Part III must have been exhausted by all that hurtling back and forth along the space-time continuum that Michael J. Fox did in Back to the Future Part II. (If only hed been racking up frequent-flier mileage) In Part III they simply plop down Marty McFly (Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in the Old West and leave them there. This last installment in the series is also the first dud. More than anything it recalls those campy 60s sitcoms that always featured an Old West episode -- you know a character would get conked on the head the story would turn into a dream sequence in 10-gallon hats and the whole thing would be filmed on generic Western sets. Back to the Future Part III has that same sort of studio back-lot clunkiness. Only this time its the audience that gets conked -- by the sheer desperation of the whole enterprise. Writer-producer Bob Gale and director Robert Zemeckis trot out all the frontier cliches. Cowboys gallop through Monument Valley to the beat of thumping Ponderosa music. The bullying Biff Tannen (Thomas F.Wilson) shows up as a distant ancestor ""Mad Dog"" Tannen a black-hatted gunslinger who fires bullets at Martys feet to make him dance. The climactic shoot-out is a dim parody of spaghetti Westerns. Meanwhile the plot hinges on how to get the DeLorean time machine back to 1985 without the aid of gasoline. What a hip and funny invention that magical sports car seemed in the first movie and what a laborious device it has become.Part III opens with a 10-minute onslaught of Doc Browns ranting metaphysics. Throughout the film he keeps shouting ""Great Scott"" and launching into another soliloquy. Hes like a speed freak reading from a physics textbook. Its just about impossible to decipher what hes saying or to care. Part II was crammed with so much manic invention that it was like a roller coaster that wouldnt stop. Zemeckis certainly held your attention but in an aggressive pointless way. Gone was the soul the cross-generational emotionalism that made the first movie a pop classic. In Part III Zemeckis continues his transition from moviemaker to glorified mechanic. Theres hardly a spark of life left in this material (its just a compendium of gimmickry now) yet Zemeckis and his executive producer Steven Spielberg seem content to trivialize their own accomplishment. The fact that they shot II and III back-to-back was widely publicized. Now that III has arrived its obvious that they put their passion into the heady money-saving logistics of filming two episodes in rapid-fire succession. Theyve turned the Back to the Future series into a marketing blitzkrieg releasing this installment less than a year after the previous one and bringing Part II out on videocassette a day before Part III hit the theaters. Spielberg and Zemeckis may be marketing geniuses but its hard to believe todays young audiences will want to sit through a blandly synthetic Western parody. Back to the Future Part III might have worked had Zemeckis mixed up the present and the past more injecting futuristic elements into the antiquated setting and turning the whole movie into a delirious sci-fi hodgepodge. On the few occasions he tries this sort of thing -- the flying hoverboard from Part II makes a crucial reappearance -- the results are amusing. But the only true surprise of this movie is how lazy it is. This time Marty is more of a bystander. The story centers on Doc Brown -- a crucial mistake considering that Lloyd a very funny character actor is best in small doses and that Michael J. Foxs crack timing is one of the strongest elements in the series. Doc falls in love with a pretty schoolmarm (Mary Steenburgen) who shares his passion for Jules Verne; its a romance of eggheads. At the same time hes desperately trying to prevent himself from being shot and killed. Marty and Doc you see have stumbled upon a tombstone that features the exact date of Docs death. Unless they can change the course of history Doc has less than a week to live. The time-travel logic seems shakier than ever. After all if Doc (as it stands now) died in 1885 then how could he have invented the time machine that first brought him back to 1885? And how could Marty have joined him? Oh well -- the Planet of the Apes sequels never made much sense either. Here though Zemeckis slipshod plotting results not just from carelessness but from his trying to wrap up the series with an upbeat message. For all its screwball buoyancy the original Back to the Future was rigorously deterministic. It held fast to the idea that one tiny event could alter your destiny for better or worse. Part III is full of sappy homilies about how ""the future is what you make it"" -- i.e. regardless of the past if you just work hard enough to change things everything will turn out fine. At one point Doc exasperated by all the trouble his DeLorean has gotten him into talks about how he wants to ""destroy that infernal machine."" Traveling through time he says ""has become much too painful."" At this point many in the audience may well agree.
