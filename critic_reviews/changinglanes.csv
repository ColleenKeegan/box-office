The simple desire to do whats right is upended in the morally ambiguous world of ""Changing Lanes"" which combines a knack for storytelling with a rare instinct for exploring ideas within the framework of a major star-driven Hollywood movie. Pic captures the excitement of lightning in a bottle for stars Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson for tyro screenwriter Chap Taylor (who penned the story) and Brit helmer Roger Michell who displays an aggressive punch that couldnt be further from his Blighty outings such as ""Notting Hill."" The fingerprints of co-writer Michael Tolkin also appear throughout particularly as pic develops into a morality tale in which the meanings of justice and revenge become nebulous indeed. Akin to work fashioned by Paddy Chayefsky drama may put off a portion of Afflecks fan base while fully satisfying Jacksons producing likely modest B.O. results. The key to ""Changing Lanes"" lies in a paradox Pacing is that of a propulsive action thriller; yet pic is also notably patient in the manner it establishes and then layers the characters introducing each additional moral problem at the right moment. Pic has all the trappings of high-concept moviemaking without the high concept and with highly flawed heroes which may partly explain the involvement of Michell whose previous films evince a taste for characters whose actions arent always palatable. Script is one of the more intriguing out of Hollywood in awhile since it prompts curiosity about which writer was responsible for what ideas; certainly the dramas obsession with exploring the dark consequences of well-intended behavior would seem to be the mark of Tolkin. In a stunningly swift nine-minute prelude the lives of New Yorkers Gavin Banek (Affleck) and Doyle Gipson (Jackson) are brought together. Banek is a hot rising 29-year-old attorney in the Wall Street firm of Arnell Delano and Strauss whose office walls are adorned by Dufy Rothko and Chagall. Gipson is an insurance company phone rep and an alcoholic whose wife Valerie (Kim Staunton) has divorced him and is planning to take their two young sons to Portland Ore. Baneks assignment on this Good Friday is to handle a pesky probate case involving a trust held by late tycoon Simon Dunne and being disputed by Dunnes angry granddaughter Mina (Jennifer Dundas Lowe). Gipson is on his way to court to show the judge he has just bought a home in Queens for his ex and kids in the hopes that the judge wont let them move to Oregon. Both start the day brimming with confidence Banek hosts a public tribute to Dunnes foundation and Gipson says at an AA meeting that he isnt drinking champagne but that he ""feels like champagne."" Each drives to court in a rush distracted by papers and cell phones and suddenly they ram their cars into each others cars sides while jockeying for a lane. Gipson wants to exchange insurance information but Banek wants instead to write him a blank check for any damages. By rejecting Baneks offer and wanting to ""do the right thing"" Gipson unwittingly sets off an increasingly vicious cycle of tit-for-tat. With a storytelling efficiency that characterizes the whole film and gets it past several narrative question marks drama immediately ratchets up for both men. Banek accidentally leaves a crucial file at the crash scene and is berated in court by the judge; Gipson grabs the file Banek left but arrives at his court hearing late and is unable to plead his case convincingly. Michell with editor Christopher Tellefsen conceives a pattern of cross-cutting to parallel the bereft ill-fated characters lives but the conscious mirroring of circumstances never feels mannered since underneath it all is a keen consideration of the contrasts of class and less overtly race. A less courageous and more politically correct scenario might have tipped aud sympathies in Gipsons favor but as the days events play out its clear that each side is culpable in a cycle of recrimination. Banek quickly sinks into a moral sewer as he lies to his boss and father-in-law Delano (Sydney Pollack) by saying that he won the case; and -- worst of all -- takes the suggestion of his lover who works at the firm Michelle (Toni Collette) to hire a hacker (Dylan Baker) who can wipe out Gipsons credit record and make him bankrupt. This is in reaction to a threatening note Gipson has faxed him concerning the left-behind file. Neither has quite enough time to examine what it is the other or their self is doing. Its up to others in each mans life to force them to reflect. Gipson must deal with both Valerie and his well-meaning AA sponsor (a low-key William Hurt). Banek has to answer to his wife Cynthia (Amanda Peet) who finds out about his affair and secret dealings at the law firm. There may be no doubt that this Hatfield and McCoy will jointly find a way to come to a kind of peace. If the films quite muted happy ending comes off as a tad contrived its largely because of the dangerous extremes to which each man has pushed the others buttons. Still Michells direction concludes the action on a contemplative note that feels right. Though his role at first plays right into a cocky attitude Affleck all too easily and repeatedly adopts as an actor the journey into a moral fog compels him to play more inwardly and thoughtfully than he ever has before. By the time his Banek ironically laughs at the naive certitudes of a law grad applying for a job at the firm Affleck has explored most sides of a young man going through a steep learning curve resulting in his most thoroughly wrought performance since ""Chasing Amy."" Jackson conveys Gipsons astonishment at the events and ultimate disappointment at his own weaknesses through the brilliant quiet form the thesp seems so readily able to muster.Casting is absolute aces up and down the roster with every scene rounded out with distinctly conceived supporting work from (among others) Collette Baker Staunton Hurt Peet Lowe and Pollack whose Delano is a strikingly close cousin to his doctor in ""Eyes Wide Shut.""Elegant production brings forth many moments of unexpected beauty and depth with an underlying Warren Shaw sound design and a nervous techno-style score by David Arnold always keeping things on edge. Production designer Kristi Zea creates some amazing class-conscious interior spaces that teem with city life and wealth with Salvatore Totinos widescreen lensing sensitive to every visual opportunity.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Changing Lanes A Riveting Chain Reaction washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Changing Lanes A Riveting Chain Reaction Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 12 2002 ""CHANGING LANES"" reeks of high-concept tackiness two men (Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Affleck) from different walks of life bump cars on New York Citys FDR Drive. Their ensuing altercation is just the beginning of a cycle of revenge and counter-revenge that lasts for the rest of the movie. Oh puhleez you think. But lo this movie is directed by Roger Michell who also helmed ""Persuasion"" an adaptation of the Jane Austen novel and ""Notting Hill"" the Hugh Grant-Julia Roberts romantic comedy. Not exactly road-rage material. And although co-writer Michael Tolkin wrote ""Deep Impact"" he also created the relatively heady ""The Player"" and ""The Rapture."" Somethings almost fishily promising about this project. Indeed ""Changing Lanes"" is far richer than youd ever think possible. It doesnt completely free itself of Hollywoods conceptual shackles but boy does it come close. Almost all of the movie - except a Stilton-cheesy resolution - is engaging stuff. Its like good television. I say ""good television"" because television dramas are more dependent on dialogue than movies which are usually visual. ""Changing Lanes"" is full of talk - well-wrought talk. And good talk always means good characters. Even the supporting characters (including William Hurt as an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor and Toni Colette as Afflecks office-mate) get deeper than usual about the moral issues. Screenwriters Tolkin and debut-writer Chap Taylor make this protracted clash of two very obstinate wills really matter. Why is that? For one thing we get to know Doyle Gipson (Jackson) and Gavin Banek (Affleck) before the accident. Theyre normal vulnerable beings with foibles and strengths. Doyles a recovering alcoholic whos about to make his case in a custody battle. He loves his two sons but his ex-wife (a stunning Kim Staunton - and incidentally locally born) has other ideas about his ability to be a responsible parent. Gavins a lawyer on his way to fight for a dying mans wishes in a will contestation. Its not just any will. The deceased was the head of a huge charitable foundation. By the time they meet in that unfortunate smash-up on FDR were rooting for both of them. Lawyer Gavin tries (as usual) to fast-forward his way out of trouble by offering to blank-check all Doyles damages. But Doyle is obsessed with doing things the right way. He wants to settle this through the normal channels. Gavin has no choice but to split with the matter still undecided. Hes leaving the scene of an accident. But this will be no clean getaway. Hes left something behind a terribly important document. Doyle keeps that document. Neither one has time for this. ""Changing Lanes"" is an entertaining exercise in audience manipulation and I mean that in the best way. One bad development begets another. But every time Doyle or Gavin tries to make things right things conspire to thwart the gesture. Which gets them madder. So they do something bad again in desperate response. Underscoring this downward spiral is the coulda been Both men are so close to getting things right in their lives if only theyd stop trying to one-up (or maybe one-down) each other. And its this combination of moral potential and never-a-dull-moment action that makes ""Changing Lanes"" a little more than just pulp friction. CHANGING LANES (R 99 minutes) - Contains obscene language some violence and overall intensity. Area theaters.

"A Collision of Wills washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On A Collision of Wills Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday April 12 2002 ""AND GOD saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good."" And then someone screwed it all up by inventing the car. A stretch maybe but not in the universe of ""Changing Lanes"" a smart nervy urban thriller that has its genesis in a run-of-the-mill fender bender. Set in New York on the Friday before Easter ""Changing Lanes"" is many things all of them very good an ideal vehicle for two muscular charismatic and drastically different screen talents; a taut authentic drama of contemporary urban manners; a jittery urban parable; a twisty-turny mind game. But what it does best is wrap as quaint a chestnut as the Golden Rule in chrome corruption and tit-for-tat violence that makes ""The Itchy and Scratchy Show"" from ""The Simpsons"" look like ""Little Women."" Ben Affleck plays Gavin Banek a young lawyer whos just made partner in his father-in-laws firm and is on his way to seal a million-dollar case when he blindsides another driver. That hapless chap happens to be Doyle Gibson (Samuel L. Jackson) whos also on his way to court - to wage one last fight to keep his estranged wife from taking their two young sons to live in Oregon. The sideswipe is the kind you see every day on New Yorks FDR Drive - its all over in a New York minute. Except that Gavin is late and he is after all a young Master of the Universe so he blows off the exchange of insurance cards and dismissively shoves a blank check into Doyles hand. For Doyle a recovering alcoholic who is trying desperately to walk the walk this is tantamount to a slap across the face with a white glove. Worse the delay will have dire consequences for him and for his family. His chance to strike back comes when Gavin leaves behind a crucial file the getting and keeping of which will put into play a series of diabolical parries and thrusts between the two men. (Hint The hit man of the 21st century doesnt piddle around with mere bullets.) But during the long Good Friday during which most of ""Changing Lanes"" takes place the real fights will occur within Gavin and Doyle themselves as each does mortal battle with the best and worst of his nature. Affleck and Jackson are ideally suited to their roles each carefully calibrating his performance to keep viewers guessing as to what is really driving him. Although Affleck is clearly in his element as the callow yuppie the one with more tricks up his sleeve here is Jackson whose Doyle is a bespectacled sad sack almost lost in his shapeless raincoat - until he erupts in a galvanizing show of righteous rage during his second confrontation with Gavin. Its with this pivot point that ""Changing Lanes"" really takes off; from that moment on the movie goes for the throat and keeps squeezing. There are no bad or even okay performances in ""Changing Lanes."" Theyre all terrific from the two leading men to Toni Collette as Gavins former lover (is there another actress who can convey so many contradictory emotions in her face simultaneously?). Sydney Pollack delivers an appropriately oily turn as Gavins ruthless father-in-law and Amanda Peet as the young Mrs. Banek steals one of the movies most powerful scenes during which she proves that shes nothing if not her daddys daughter. Kim Staunton and William Hurt make fine work of two small roles as Doyles ex-wife and AA sponsor respectively. Just as convincing as the cast is the overall look of ""Changing Lanes"" in which production designer Kristi Zea has re-created every echelon of New York with a keen eye for detail The overflowing files and dry cleaning that vie with the odd Rothko and Alex Katz for space in a high-end law firm are just as authentically rendered as the crowded chaos of Manhattan Family Court. The story and screenplay of ""Changing Lanes"" are by Chap Taylor a first-timer who has help from the redoubtable Michael Tolkin. Without knowing who wrote what its tempting to credit Tolkin with the movies acutely intelligent dialogue. As the writer of ""The Player"" ""The New Age"" and ""The Rapture"" hes the proven master of films that reflect exactly what its like to live in a particular place at a particular time. Too there are quite a few Tolkinesque monologues that save for one gratuitous outburst at a church capture with pitch-perfect verisimilitude what smart people sound like when they talk to each other. The British director Roger Michell whos done such a good job with Jane Austen (""Persuasion"") and Julia Roberts (""Notting Hill"") proves his mettle with the many action sequences that drive ""Changing Lanes."" He and cinematographer Salvatore Totino have photographed all of it in a dizzying jumble of constantly moving close-ups. Its usually an off-putting visual style but it works for a movie whose subject is moral uncertainty and the continually shifting tectonics of situational ethics. One of the many felicities of the film is that as sadistic as the mutual vengeance gets Michell always shows the searing afterburn left on the perpetrator. Indeed the only flab in this otherwise lean and uncompromising film comes at the very end with a warm-and-fuzzy cop-out that looks suspiciously tacked on (never underestimate the idiocy of the San Fernando Valley that circle of Hell whence all test audiences are spawned). Still ""Changing Lanes"" is as tough as they come even while its moral is as enduring as the Passion itself Love your neighbor turn the other cheek and for Gods sake use your turn signal.

Jackson Toni Collette Sydney Pollack William Hurt Amanda Peet. Directed by Roger Michell from a screenplay by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin based on a story by Taylor. 99 minutes. Rated R for language. Several theaters. E-mail this article Print this article Related stories The Sweetest Thing takes wing with pure fluff Raunchy silliness or soul-searching revenge drama? Or to put it simply fluff or plot? This weekends two biggest releases are a study in contrasts. You want plot? ""Changing Lanes"" has plot and lots of it a traffic accident two struggling marriages a father trying to re-establish himself with his sons corruption within a Wall Street law firm a potential fraud case involving a dead philanthropist a crucial lost file alcoholism illegal computer hacking bankruptcy a false fire alarm and the basic struggle to be a good person in a world in which goodness is not always rewarded. And hey all this happens in the first half-hour or so. Fasten your seat belts. Thanks to a tight screenplay by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin (""The Player"") and the unflagging pace set by director Roger Michell ""Changing Lanes"" doesnt feel overburdened by all its drama which all stems from one small incident. Young Manhattan attorney Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) on his way to a court hearing has a fender-bender with Doyle Gipson (Samuel L. Jackson) a man struggling to put his life back together. Angry words are exchanged both men are late to their appointments and an intricate revenge plot clicks into place. Like Sam Raimis masterful ""A Simple Plan"" a few years back ""Changing Lanes"" deals with how good people can when pressured by circumstances do very very bad things. Its a rare big-studio movie that seems to operate in a moral universe -- as Gavin and Doyle lash out at each other using whatever weapons are available to them natural and believable consequences ensue. And each man is given not a standard-issue sidekick but a conscience and voice of reason Doyles in the form of his wise AA sponsor (William Hurt); Gavins in his ex-lover and co-worker Michelle (the always affecting Toni Collette with what may be the most hideous movie hairdo of the year). Many good actors flit through this busy movie Dylan Baker his ears glowing red as a devilish hacker; Sydney Pollack as Gavins morally compromised father-in-law; Kim Staunton as Doyles angry wife. But the movie rests on the shoulders of Affleck and Jackson and theyre more than up to the task. Affleck seems to be doing his usual charming frat-boy overachiever then shows in one remarkable scene -- listening to an idealistic law student he suddenly starts to laugh -- that hes something quite different. And Jackson playing the entire movie as a man on the verge of desperation and utter collapse has an aching close-up at the end. He makes us believe despite everything in goodness.

(HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT ROAD RAGE / In noir thriller Changing Lanes a car crash thrusts two flawed men into a spiral of mayhem and revenge 1 / 1 Back to Gallery CHANGING LANES Drama. Starring Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by Roger Michell. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres the world of surfaces and the world underneath it of amorality and chaos. ""Changing Lanes"" gets to that underneath layer. Its a big-budget thriller with a sensibility that sets it apart from the usual Hollywood movie a modern film noir done with flair and commitment. Today when most people think of film noir they think of movies with gullible men taken in by hard bad women like Jane Greer or Barbara Stanwyck. Modern noirs responding to the obvious have mainly focused on the dark side of sex but noir was always about more than that. Noir is really about moral choices -- the difficulty of being a good person in a world whose every motion seems to reinforce corruption and conformity. ""Changing Lanes"" is a successful movie largely because of its willingness to work this deeper side of the noir tradition. Here characters have more to fear from the darkness inside themselves than from the actions of other people. Something Related Stories Car crash leads to mayhem revenge / Changing Lanes true noir thriller happens -- and from there the lives of two men go into a tailspin. Or as one of them puts it in a sentiment worthy of Dick Powell in a fedora ""Sometimes God likes to take two guys put em in a paper bag and let em rip."" Ben Affleck plays Gavin a hotshot lawyer and Samuel Jackson plays Doyle a struggling middle-class man estranged from his family. One morning the two men get into an accident on New Yorks FDR Drive. The lawyer isnt a bad guy but in true noir form he commits a single bad action from which everyones troubles derive. In his haste to get to court he strands Doyle on the highway. As a result Doyle misses a custody hearing and loses the right to see his children. The consequences are also bad for Gavin. He gets to court only to find that he left an all-important file at the accident scene. Unless he recovers the file by the end of the day he could go to jail. And Doyle has it. So thats ""Changing Lanes."" One guy has a file. The other needs it. One guy hates the others guts. The other just wants his file back. The rest of the movie is a study in character and escalating mayhem. The characters make the film compelling and make every misfortune seem inevitable. Its a nice touch that Doyle is a complicated and troubled man not a villain or a mere victim. He is an angry tightly wound recovering alcoholic who with regard to his family has been the author of his own misery. Affleck plays the more traditional noir hero. One mistake leads to another and the next thing he knows hes committing fraud and extortion. He is in the noir spiral spinning out of control circling the moral drain. As is usual in noir theres a woman involved and ""Changing Lanes"" comes up with an interesting one -- Amanda Peet as Gavins demure wife who for all her primness embraces the fundamental immorality of Gavins life as a ""Wall Street lawyer"" and asks her husband to embrace it too. ""Can you live there with me?"" In such moments ""Changing Lanes"" is more chilling than ""The Devils Advocate"" in which Satan ran a law firm. Here the movers and shakers are people like Gavins wife and genial fellows like Sydney Pollack as Gavins boss. The evil is casual and pleasant visible to anyone who can see past the surface. ""Changing Lanes"" was co-written by first-time screenwriter Chap Taylor from his own story but the influence of co-writer Michael Tolkin is unmistakable. Tolkin wrote ""The Player"" and ""The Rapture"" both bleak morality tales. Director Roger Michell (""Notting Hill"") meanwhile lends the film an eeriness thats only made more eerie by the sight of the World Trade Centers twin towers in the background. (The movie was filmed in the first months of 2001.) At its best watching ""Changing Lanes"" is like watching controlled madness. In some scenes the soundtrack quietly plays just a single note underneath the action the sonic equivalent of stretched piano wire -- when will it snap? In the end ""Changing Lanes"" doesnt fully commit itself to its noir sensibility. It doesnt stretch that wire as far as it will go. But for a Ben Affleck movie this is fairly adventurous stuff. Advisory This film contains strong language.

For a road-rage movie released in escapist April it is dark contemplative and always directed to emphasize characterization by Notting Hills Roger Michell (a smart hire and another surprise). If its not conventionally speedy it is almost always gripping as two New Yorkers keep escalating vengeful one-upmanship during the worst day either has ever had. In the ensuing confusion after sideswiping another car on the way to work a Wall Street lawyer (Ben Affleck) loses the file that is his only defense against fraud accusations against his firm and himself. By being delayed in the same incident an alcoholic insurance agent (Samuel L. Jackson) who spots and keeps the file misses his own crucial court date. It is to determine whether his wife who has lost all patience with him will be allowed to uproot their children to Oregon to get away from him. Facing different levels of ruin the two men spend the rest of the day playing for the highest stakes. One nearly kills the other in an act of auto sabotage while the other hires a computer hacker to ruin his new nemesis financially. As Jackson is told late in the movie his boozing may be less of a problem than his lifetime penchant for attracting chaos. At least on this one day Affleck seems to have the same affliction. There are times when both men show signs of saying enough-is-enough and calling a truce but someone is always upping the ante. Even compellingly staged tit-for-tat might grow tiresome if two well-cast leads werent getting help from the supporting players. Cast in strongly written roles (by Chap Taylor and Michael Tolin) are Kim Staunton as Jacksons emotionally shot wife; Toni Collette as Afflecks unhappy colleague and lover; Amanda Peet as his savvy but financially spoiled wife; Dylan Baker as a hacker with his childs crayon artwork on the wall; and filmmaker Sydney Pollack (a variation on his slimy high-roller in Eyes Wide Shut) as a boat-loving law firm honcho and Peets papa who finds it easy to rationalize defrauding a charity. The movie stumbles a little at the end by trying to wrap up the story a tad too neatly as if someone tacked on a 50s ending to an edgy 70s script. But not quite -- and maybe not without justification from an audience point of view. When its midway through a long day of horrors and a sympathetic character has already lost a sure-thing bank loan theres only so much moviegoers can take in spring weather.

Jackson as two men whose lives cross one Good Friday in New York. In a perfectly pitched introduction we get a glimpse into the worlds of both men and witness their flaws and their strengths -- which shows how much the two have to lose if their fragile worlds are challenged and then thrown into chaos. Affleck plays Gavin Banek a hot-shot lawyer whos married to the boss daughter. At 29 hes already a partner in a huge prestigious Manhattan law firm. He lives in the rarefied world of the citys wealthy elite and hes gotten to where he is by displaying a lot of charm -- and by not looking too closely at the illegal inner workings of his father-in-laws legal practice. Jackson portrays Doyal Gipson a middle-aged middle-class recovering alcoholic who is fighting for joint custody of his two sons. He takes his life one paycheck at a time. On the surface these two men have little in common one is on the top of his game and the other is struggling up from rock bottom.
