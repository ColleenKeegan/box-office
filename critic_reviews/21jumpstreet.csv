Every character is a caricature looking to steal their scenes and hold their ground. The film has the trademark rhythm of on-set riff sessions being whittled down to a manageable length and several supporting players would appear to have once had more than a scene or two apiece with which to get their laughs. Of course that would only be a substantial problem if 21 Jump Street didnt turn out to be - for the most part - one damn funny comedy. From the start Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman one scene) dryly explains how ""the guys in charge are out of original ideas and find themselves forced to recycle old programs."" Thus suitably juvenile underachievers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are assigned to the eponymous undercover operation in order to prevent the spread of a new drug H.F.S. through the halls of squeaky-clean Sagan High. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) makes the rules clear dont get expelled dont sleep with anyone infiltrate the dealers and find the supplier. Naturally this is easier said than done. A tubby loser seven years earlier Schmidt dreads returning to the persecution of his adolescence; meanwhile Jenko finds himself facing a redefined social paradigm in which jerky jocks now rank beneath the goody-goody eco-friendly types led by Eric (Dave Franco). Worse yet the wonder cops have confused their own false identities which sees the former tackling track and theater with the cool crowd while relegating the latter to math science and an all-around geekier walk of life. The scenario sees Hill playing to his sarcastic strengths while Tatum gets to tweak and toy with his boy-toy persona. The result is a cheeky inversion of the usual teen movie blueprint in addition to serving as a knowing embrace of the inherent silliness of tossing plainly adult post-graduates into a high school environment and expecting nobody to notice or care all that much. As written by Hill and Michael Bacall (Project X Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) nigh every scene of 21 Jump Street addresses the divide between the past and present with playfulness whether its the flipped dichotomy between the one-time alpha male and the long-time dweeb the goofy notion of updating a straight-faced 80s TV show into an all-out present-day lark or the idea that the high school experience remains the same no matter how its students (and their culture) transform. The tone adapted by directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord (2009s goofy-brilliant Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and the cult cartoon ""Clone High"") is a proudly juvenile one treating the material as something of a post-modern playground without relying solely on winks to inch the film past its requisite conflicts (ex Schmidt can never close the deal with either perps or ladies; Jenko cant even recall his Miranda rights). Its the little touches that go far. When our officers wind up in a highway chase they find themselves continually disappointed by the lack of Big Explosions; when they pull up to prom they let loose their own doves for faux-dramatic effect. Cruder touches only overwhelm the general air of irreverence on occasion with earlier innuendos feeling like easy shots and a climactic gag involving a grisly redefinition of oral endeavors indeed earning a gag itself. While one might feel that Miller and Lord could have used a dose of the discipline essential to their animated projects they fill the frame with tiny touches (mind the off-campus billboards; the worlds worst prom theme is harder to miss) and capable comedians. Rob Riggle as a blustery coach Chris Parnell as a self-important drama teacher Jake Johnson as a fed-up principal Ellie Kemper as a science teacher with the hots and then some for Jenko - theyre all about as hilarious as can be while barely being there. With Jenko falling out with Schmidt Schmidt falling for classmate Molly (the utterly adorable Brie Larson) and Capt. Dickson breathing down both of their necks there are already plenty of hijinks to go around and thats not even mentioning a couple of cameos... The local color is welcome though while the third act pays off in spades and the perfectly bombastic end credits set Eisensteinian film theory figuratively aflame with a lit fart. Without treading too much of the same ground as Hot Fuzz the whole crew makes clear their affections for action cinema trashy television and the YouTube generation alike while having fun at the expense of all three. When raiding the police departments evidence lock-up for party supplies Schmidt suggests that Jenko grab a pound of pot rather than a pound of cocaine clarifying that ""we want to show them a good time not ruin their lives."" Its fair to say that 21 Jump Street not only shares that sentiment but ultimately succeeds in that respect.

"Jump to it Remake of the 80s show delivers laughs if not nostalgia |       NJ.com comments Jump to it Remake of the 80s show delivers laughs if not nostalgia Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 16 2012 at 808 AM View/Post Comments Scott GarfieldChanning Tatum and Jonah Hill in ""21 Jump Street."" Do you remember ""21 Jump Street"" the TV series? The late-80s version of ""The Mod Squad"" that had a fabulously moussed Johnny Depp as an undercover passing-for-underage cop? The filmmakers behind ""21 Jump Street"" the movie do too. But they dont remember it as fondly as you may. They see it as just a title and a hook -- cops in high school -- for a raucous raunchy comedy. And thats pretty much what they deliver mixing gunshots and Jager shots -- ""The Super Cops"" meets ""Superbad."" And they actually do it pretty well. A good part of the credit should probably go to star Jonah Hill who co-wrote the story and also helped produce. Like Hill the film seems aware of both its own cliches and the real world. So on one hand it acknowledges its recycling making jokes about people who have no imagination or originality and staging a car chase so cliched youd think it was out of a Michael Bay film. And on the other it looks at high school with fresh eyes and how quickly the culture changes. Our undercover cops are supposedly only in their mid-20s. But still theyre terminally out of it. Since when did it become totally quaint to use the phone for actually like calling people? When did caring passionately about something -- gay rights the environment drama -- totally replace not caring at all as being cool? Fitting in isnt going to be as easy as these cops figured. Hill and co-star Channing Tatum play nicely off their own images. The slightly slimmed-down Hill is still playing the kid with the kick-me sign here and reveling in it. (A high school flashback -- showing him as a desperate Eminem wannabe -- is particularly nasty fun.) And Tatum a simple slab of beef in more serious movies finds a new freedom in comedy making fun of his dumb-stud persona and partnering nicely with Hill in some back-and-forth comedy. The rest of the quietly excellent cast includes Brie Larson as a quirky drama student Dave Franco (who looks just like older brother James) as a sardonic campus weasel and a tirelessly profane Ice Cube as a blistering police officer. Ice Cubes profanity isnt the raunchiest thing about this movie. Hill almost literally grew up in the Judd Apatow world of comedy so there are endless jokes about penises astoundingly crude insults and far too many jokes where the only punch line seems to be ""gay."" Add to that Hills fondness for stories about underage drinking rampant drug use zipless hookups and assaults on private dignity and personal property and you get a movie many people older than 30 arent going to want to see and no one younger than 17 is allowed to. But you also get a movie with some laughs -- including one huge one right near the end. And sometimes on a Friday night -- and heading into a hard-partying St. Patricks Day weekend -- thats all you want. Ratings note The film contains something to offend everyone twice. 21 Jump Street (R) Columbia (109 min.) Directed by Phil Lord Chris Miller. With Jonah Hill Channing Tatum. Now playing in New Jersey. THREE STARS.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Laugh all you want life never stops being like high school. Never. is an action comedy that holds that truth to be self-evident. It stars Jonah Hill 28 and Channing Tatum 31 as cops who go undercover in high school to bust a drug ring and wind up futilely trying to correct everything they screwed up in their teens. ""How old are you - 40?"" asks a fellow student as Tatum (in a revelatory bust-out comic performance) tries to squeeze into a dainty classroom seat. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Hey wait. Wasnt there a Fox TV series with Johnny Depp that did the same shtick back in the 1980s? Yeah. But 21 Jump Street is no cheeseball reboot. Producer Hill who came up with the story with screenwriter Michael Bacall (Project X) has too much affection for the TV series to reduce it to a spoof. A priceless cameo from Depp in the role he created and about which my lips are sealed confirms it. This bracing new take on 21 Jump Street has a playful spark all its own. Its a blast. Oscar nominee Hill (I love saying that about the Moneyball star) is terrific as Schmidt the brains of the duo since Tatums Jenko barely mustered out of the police academy without his coaching. These dudes hated each other in high school. Check out the hilarious opening flashback with jock Jenko and supernerd Schmidt in braces and dyed-yellow curls like a not-so-Slim Shady emerging as natural-born enemies. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller known for the animated Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs have an instinct to go for giggly farce but Hill and Tatum stay admirably rooted to character. Assigned to the Jump Street unit thats been dead since the 1980s the team takes R-rated orders from hardass Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) who has scant use for the ""Justin Bieber/Miley Cyrus muthafuckas"" under his command. Schmidt and Jenko pose as brothers at the same high school to finger a student pusher. That hes clean-cut vegan Eric (Dave Franco brother of James with a distinctly wicked comic gift) is part of the joke. ""I blame Glee"" says Jenko who cant cut it with the cool crowd. They prefer Schmidt the anti-bully who fearlessly dons tights to star in a musical of Peter Pan and actually has a shot at nailing his Wendy (Brie Larson). 21 Jump Street throws way more balls in the air than it can comfortably juggle. The car chases have a frantic Michael Bay whoosh but the kick comes in watching Schmidt and Jenko steal weed from a police evidence locker to throw a stoner house party and then to prove theyre not narcs get high on a drug that could literally blow their minds. Are we always still in high school in our heads? 21 Jump Street thinks so. And Hill and Tatum are just the crazy-ass comedy team to prove it.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 16 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The earnestly silly TV series 21 Jump Street about young undercover detectives ran from 1987 to 1991 helping the fledgling Fox network reach a youth demographic whilelaunching Johnny Depps career. A quarter century later the title provides an opportunity for a raunchy stoner bro-comedy pairing schlubby misfit Schmidt (Jonah Hill) with handsome but dumb pal Jenko (Channing Tatum) as a couple of inept cops sent to infiltrate a high-school drug ring. Screen grab from the online trailer for the comedy ""21 Jump Street"" starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill movies 21 Jump Street The official trailer AP Video video Video Bromace blossoms for Channing and Jonah The new 21 Jump Street directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (the animated Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) is a try-anything fitfully amusing muddle that wears its mocking cynicism a bit too proudly. After Schmidt and Jenko blow a high-profile case their supervisor (Nick Offerman) assigns them to a new division which exists he explains only because the police have run out of new ideas. All they can do is recycle crap from the eighties ""and expect nobody to notice."" In a similar vein the detective in charge of the program (Ice Cube) is an angry black man who explains that hes an angry black man. ""Embrace your stereotypes"" he bellows. In truth 21 Jump Street is less a copy of the TV series than another Superbad in which Hill also starred an excuse for comic actors to goof on the back-to-school experience. Schmidt and Jenko both 25 pose as brothers who are new to the school. Through a mix-up they end up switching identities. Schmidt the nerd finds himself taking bird courses (drama) and running track while former star athlete Jenko is stuck in advanced chemistry hanging out with the geek squad. Naturally a blowout teen party (the cops steal party supplies from the police lock-up) which allows screenwriter Michael Bacall to offering a 10-minute precis version of Project X (which he co-scripted). Otherwise Johnny Depp makes a cameo and James Francos younger brother Dave Franco makes a brief impression as a wistful eco-friendly anti-bullying drug dealer. Throughout Hill (who shares story credits with screenwriter Bacall) plays it supersafe reprising his usual shtick as the nervously verbose misfit. Tatum though is a pleasant surprise. Too often cast as the wooden dreamboat ( Dear John The Vow) he seems freed up doing comedy like a younger Brendan Fraser with a sweetness that contrasts with his hulking physique. As 21 Jump Street lurches toward its noisy prom-meets-gunfight ending the penis and gay panic jokes proliferate with Superbad intensity. Theyre tedious but a lot less creepy than the romantic heterosexual subplot which sees Schmidt as a supposed misfit 25-year-old cop pretending to be a teenager hitting on a high-school student (Brie Larsen).

Photo (c)Columbia Pictures Back in high school as an undercover cop Jonah Hill may be headed to prom with Brie Larson. Assigning two young cops to go undercover at a high school their boss tells them ""The guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas."" Then he tells them to report to ""37 Jump Street. No that doesnt sound right . . ."" So ""21 Jump Street"" an adaptation of Johnny Depps career-launching 80s TV show is a meta-comedy -- plus its a buddy comedy a physical comedy an action comedy and a nonstop raunchy verbal riff like ""Superbad."" That ought to be enough comedy for anyone and this is the funniest movie Ive seen in more than a year. Jonah Hill as nerdy rookie cop Schmidt and Channing Tatum as Jenko a dumb fellow patrolman who used to torment him in high school make a sensational comic pair meatball meets beefcake. They slip back to high school to pose as brothers and try to break up a drug ring led by an eco-sensitive yearbook editor (James Francos little brother Dave who shows a lot of potential). Psychedelic drugs have killed a kid at the school and as the undercover officers new boss (Ice Cube who has never been funnier) tells them ""This kid was white. That means people actually give a s - - t."" PHOTOS BIG-SCREEN REMAKES Though theyve been warned not to get themselves expelled Schmidt and Jenko find that high school popularity is easy when your fake ID is real your parents (both men move in with Schmidts folks who keep naked-baby pictures of him on the wall) can be made to go away for the weekend and you can also help yourself to whatever weed is in the police evidence room. Each cop gets the others class schedule so pretty-boy Jenko is stuck trying to fake his way through advanced chemistry while the brainy but awkward Schmidt gets stuck in drama club playing Peter Pan alongside his new crush Molly (an adorable Brie Larson). Things have changed in the seven years since these guys were in school; its not OK they discover to punch somebody in the parking lot especially a short gay black student. Hot rods now run on biofuels. ""Crunchy granola kids are now cool"" says Jenko.""Its backwards and unnatural . . . I know the cause Glee F - - k you Glee"" While Schmidt is getting to know Molly (while talking to her on the phone his new fake brother commits perversion upon him with a stuffed giraffe) he is still traumatized by his senior-year shame of being turned down for a prom date. So when she tries to kiss him he goes for the handshake instead. Thats a ""Superbad""-caliber moment painfully awkward and true. But if you like car chases shootings and explosions there are plenty of those all brilliantly thrown into a chaotic ""Lethal Weapon"" spoof by directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who did the kid movie ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs""). A terrifically smart and fresh script by Michael Bacall keeps balancing absurdity against believable human moments notably when the boys rush to grab a drivers ed car for a high-speed chase and the driving teacher after a brief protest says ""Eh who cares?"" That line nails high school more than anything in ""The Breakfast Club."" Hill who shares a story credit with Bacall and contributed I assume a lot of ideas exudes the kind of quick-thinking savvy you cant fake as well as the bug-eyed terror of classic schlemazels from Lou Costello to early Woody Allen. Hes equally funny when praying to a Korean-looking statue of Jesus or running down the street while texting. Tatum who after showing major charisma in ""Step Up"" was oozing steadily toward oblivion thanks to movies like ""The Eagle"" ""G.I. Joe"" and ""Stop-Loss"" got himself back on track with ""The Dilemma"" and ""The Vow."" He now looks ready to rule the multiplex as long as he doesnt try to get serious again. Hes the king of all likable doofuses when after a climax that manages to work in a hilarious twist he tells his new best bud ""I woulda tooken a bullet for you.""

Starring Channing Tatum Jonah Hill Brie Larson Dave Franco Rob Riggle Ice Cube Director Phil Lord Chris Miller Running time 149 Release Opened Mar 16 2012  Editorial Review Doing justice to the 80s originalBy Ann HornadayFriday Mar. 16 2012An unbridled self-aware goofiness propels ""21 Jump Street"" an enterprise that sounded dreadful from well the jump. To take a 1980s television series reboot it into a 21st-century bromance and cast Apatow-comedy alum Jonah Hill and blandly handsome leading man Channing Tatum in the leads sounded to many like the final death knell for a movie industry that has been running on the fumes of remakes and baby-boomer nostalgia for years now. In fact the lack of originality or creative ingenuity that ""21 Jump Street"" symbolizes is addressed head-on early in the film when a surly police captain played by Ice Cube tells two new recruits that the force has resurrected a defunct program from 30 years ago that sent undercover cops into high schools. ""Its all about recycling [stuff] from the past and expecting everyone not to notice"" he explains sourly. The neophytes hes screaming at are Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) a bumbling nerd and good-looking dullard respectively who were arch-opposites in their high school but have become best buds since going through the police academy together. When theyre assigned to a high school to bust a drug ring - a scant seven years after graduating - each seizes on the opportunities - in Schimdts case to heal four years of rejection and self-loathing and in Jenkos to relive his past glory. It doesnt work out that way and what ensues is less a cool action flick reminiscent of Johnny Depps ""21 Jump Street"" than a role-reversal comedy full of good-natured jokes and sight gags which include Schmidts pathetic attempt to imitate Eminem in the movies opening high school flashback and a climactic car chase during which Hill is wearing a Peter Pan costume and Tatum is dressed as a molecule complete with pompoms stuck to his shirt. Its those playful even wholesome moments that stand out in this movie despite the profanity and partying ethic that earned it an R rating. Despite the edginess and vulgarity the production is suffused by an unmistakable sweetness no doubt thanks to the films co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller whose last outing was the family film ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."" Endearing too are Hill and Tatums supporting cast members including Dave Franco as a sleepy-eyed cool kid (his resemblance to James Franco is downright eerie until you realize theyre brothers) and a delightfully naturalistic Brie Larson as Molly the sunny blonde on whom Schmidt develops an instant crush. (Rob Riggle Ellie Kemper and Chris Parnell are also on hand with flawless comic stylings at the ready.) Of course Schmidt begins to call her - not realizing that phone calls are strictly 20th century. Much of the humor in ""21 Jump Street"" derives from how much has changed for teenagers since Schmidt and Jenko were in school. Suddenly Jenko notes liking comic books veganism and tolerance are cool - and not reasons for punching someone out. ""I blame Glee "" he says at one point. ""[Forget] you Glee "" Like Marilyn Monroe and Judy Holliday before him Tatum is sublime at playing dumb (as a dim pretty boy he seems to be channeling Brad Pitt in ""Burn After Reading"") just as Hill shrewdly deploys his body mass for maximum physical comedy (even slimmed down with an Oscar nomination under that tightened belt he carries himself with a fat mans comically elephantine grace). They work joyfully in harness developing a chemistry reminiscent of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg in last years similarly anarchic buddy flick ""The Other Guys."" This is ""The Younger Guys"" with more surreally funny drug trips and amusing cameos (yes thats TV-show alum Holly Robinson Peete as Officer Judy Hoffs). ""21 Jump Street"" might be yet another product of Hollywoods recycling program but it deserves to be noticed.Contains crude and sexual content pervasive profanity drug material teen drinking and some violence.

But who would expect Tatum as the dimwitted officer Jenko to be so comical? More often cast as a standard heartthrob -- most recently in the sappy The Vow-- Tatum holds his own with Hill and every other comic actor in the film. Their chemistry is terrific.The action comedy is based on the 1987-91 crime show known best for launching the career of Johnny Depp. The writers involved in updating it do so with finesse and knowing humor.Schmidt was the awkward brainy kid in high school while Jenko was the cool and brawny jock who failed most classes but got the girls. They couldnt be more mismatched but the two become partners upon graduating from the police academy. Not surprisingly they bungle their first arrest. Their punishment is to go undercover as high school students to investigate a drug ring.About the movie21 Jump Street out of fourStarsChanning Tatum Jonah Hill Ice Cube Ron Riggle Brie Larson Director Phil Lord and Chris MillerDistributor Sony Pictures Rating R for crude and sexual content pervasive language drug material teen drinking and some violence Running time 1 hour 49 minutes Opens Friday nationwideBut high school is nothing like they remember it.A couple of smart moves by the films screenwriters include modifying the high school ethos so that its ""cool to care"" -- about the environment tolerance and grades. The other clever element is an administrative snafu that results in the nerdy Schmidt being thrown into drama class with the popular kids while the anti-intellectual Jenko is thrown into advanced-placement chemistry with the geeks. The dialogue is fast-paced and full of pop-culture references. It all makes for an entertaining blend of buddy-cop action and irreverent teen-comedy satire.

""21 Jump Street"" the latest specimen of this subgenre serves primarily as a vehicle for the oddball pairing of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum playing rookie undercover cops assigned to bust a drug ring in a local high school. Hill in his slimmed-down mode has some choice dweeby moments but Tatum tries too hard to be goofy as does the movie.The basic premise - that these two are supposed to be high school age and siblings - is funny but the joke as is true of many others in this movie is replayed way too often.

"21 Jump Street starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum reviewed Slate Sign In Sign Up 21 Jump Street An Underachieving but Somehow Charming Spoof of the TV Series 21 Jump Street An Underachieving but Somehow Charming Spoof of the TV Series Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 15 2012 710 PM 21 Jump Street It deserves a C but it might charm its way into a B-. By Dana Stevens Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum in 21 Jump Street Sony Pictures 21 Jump Street (Sony Pictures) makes a virtue of low expectations like an underachieving high school burnout coasting on his modest reserves of charm. This spoof of the late-80s/early 90s TV series of the same name--to call it a ""remake"" would imply a more serious relationship to the source material--is earning critical praise chiefly it seems because its not as abysmally bad as it sounds on paper. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as novice cops who are forced to go undercover as high-school students to bust up a drug ring? Come on that movies going to blow right? But 21 Jump Street doesnt blow--which could have been this movies raunchy self-deprecating tagline if it didnt already have several. 21 Jump Street isnt a wild fresh reinvention of the movie-cliche-spoofing genre--this isnt Airplane were talking about--but its also not a drearily overfamiliar retread of it. It doesnt work hard enough to earn much more than a gentlemans C but I might let it sweet-talk me up to a B-. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The movie (written by Michael Bacall who also adapted the graphic novel Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) even makes an overt joke of its own laziness in an early scene. A police captain sending the young officers out on their first big assignment stresses that the only reason the ""Metropolitan City"" police force is trying this crazy plan is because theyre ""completely out of ideas."" The best plan the force can come up with is to send these two unimpressive rookies Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) back to the same high school where as we learn in an flashback they hated each other seven years earlier Jenko was a handsome easygoing jock while Schmidt was a painfully shy geek with an Eminem-wannabe bleached buzzcut. (Never has the song ""The Real Slim Shady"" been used to such poignant dramatic effect.) Jenko and Schmidt must pass themselves off as brothers in order to infiltrate a ring of students who are manufacturing and selling a synthetic designer drug. Advertisement Though the twentysomething Jenko and Schmidt are out of step with current teen fashion (they still use their phones to make phone calls for Gods sake) they slowly manage to worm their way into the circle of kids surrounding the school drug kingpin Eric (played by Dave Franco James lookalike little brother) who in a gentle poke at sincere postmillennial teen-hood is also a committed environmental activist. Erics sort-of girlfriend Molly (Brie Larson) starts a flirtation with Schmidt when hes cast as Peter Pan opposite her Wendy in the school play. As for Jenko who barely graduated from the police academy (asked to recite the Miranda rights he mumbles as much as he can remember from Law amp; Order then trails off) he finds A.P. chemistry such a struggle hes forced to form alliances with the science-geek crowd he once mocked. The action ramps up toward the second half as bigger-time drug dealers try to move in on Erics turf (one of them played in an uncredited surprise cameo by Johnny Depp who got his start on the TV series). Like Pineapple Express--another drug-themed buddy comedy that coasted further than it should have on charm--21 Jump Street starts out stronger than it ends. The movie is at its best when its exploring the Jenko/Schmidt friendship which is a surprisingly substantial one for a movie of this type Theres homosocial bonding aplenty yes but also layers of mutual envy respect and affection. Your tolerance for 21 Jump Street will depend in large part on how you feel about Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill--and if you go in unable to stand both actors its unlikely these performances will change your mind about them. Tatum plays his usual agreeable-meathead type though to his credit he does display a decent sense of comic timing. And Hill is in his naive-dork Moneyball mode rather than his abrasive Superbad one which is always a plus. Many of the smaller roles are nicely played As the superior officer the boys report to Ice Cube proudly embraces his own angry-black-man stereotype in a funny if one-note bit. And Brie Larson who was last seen doing an equally standout job as Woody Harrelsons faux-disaffected older daughter in Rampart is a find of major proportions as Schmidts goofy love interest. Shes not only beautiful but funny with a scratchy contralto voice and unlike the usual female in a buddy movie she comes across as a real person you might actually enjoy knowing. Some of Mollys phone conversations and text exchanges with Schmidt really evoke the stop-and-start rhythms of adolescent flirtation and make you understand why a looker like Molly might be drawn to an emotionally honest dork like Schmidt. (Its also carefully established for the sake of respectability that Molly is 18 and thus legal.) Chris Miller and Phil Lord (whose last directorial collaboration was the inventive animated film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) only occasionally push the gross-out humor too far especially in the late action sequences I would have been fine with a life that didnt include watching a man pick up his own shot-off penis with his teeth while his hands were cuffed behind his back. But if the first two-thirds of 21 Jump Street is anything to go by there may be a renaissance at hand for the dumb buddy-cop comedy. Im just not sure as the wags in 10th grade used to put it if thats a threat or a promise. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

In a random act of kindness the town hairdresser agrees to foster him on weekends. Video courtesy of Sundance Selects. By Joe Morgenstern March 15 2012 613 p.m. ET Some movies capture your interest in the first scene. ""The Kid With a Bike"" in subtitled French grabs you in the first few seconds and never lets go. A boy holds a phone listening intently. Hang up a man standing next to him says the numbers not in service but he refuses. When the man tries to take the phone from him he reacts with the ferocity of a wild animal who has just been cornered. The boy Cyril has been trying to phone his father from a state-run residential facility thats become his permanent home since his father disappeared. Almost instantly we intuit the kids plight. Cyril has been abandoned but he refuses to acknowledge it or to let go of his fervent love for a parent who doesnt deserve him. Thats the way things happen in movies made by the Dardenne brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc. They cut to the quick as well as the chase with surgical skill and unstressed compassion. ENLARGE Cecile de France and Thomas Doret in The Kid With a Bike. Sundance Selects The plain-wrapper title bespeaks a luminous minimalism; the image is familiar but it begs to be filled out. The bike has disappeared too though it soon turns up again both as a symbol of the boys blind faith--he cant believe that his father would have sold it--and the vehicle of Cyrils journey from angry isolation through moral peril to understanding and newfound love. As in all of the Dardennes films theres the sense of a soul at risk and a central performance of exceptional power. I cant imagine how they directed their sweet-faced towheaded young actor Thomas Doret to express such a startling range of emotions. Whats on screen though is a memorable portrait of a tough and tender kid who wont take no for an answer until a local hairdresser Samantha gives him a home and brings him around to saying yes. (Shes played with lovely simplicity by Cecile De France.) But why does Samantha do it? Exactly what in her back story or in the coils of her psyche explains her willingness to take in a kid she hardly knows? Im asking this only to emphasize how Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne choose to work. Its the sort of question that filmmakers must routinely contend with when theyre making big-budget films for movie studios where production executives are obsessed with explaining motivations because they dont trust audiences to understand on their own. The Dardenne brothers shoot small films in their native Belgium on modest budgets and they dont explain they show. Instead of serving up psychological banalities they dramatize pivotal moments--quietly astonishing moments--in which people make decisions often impulsively that change the course of lives. In Samanthas case she decides to be kind just like that although it should be said that Cyril has already decided just like that to let her know that hes open to her attentions. Lest this sound sentimental be assured that it is not; if only a little love were enough to transform the kids life with no further complications. But its very much in keeping with the brothers earlier films many of which are about the possibility of kindness. In my favorite until now the 1996 ""The Promise"" Jeremie Renier is 15-year-old Igor the blank-faced long-haired son of a vile father who traffics in illegal immigrants. When one of them suffers what is clearly a fatal injury on a construction site the dying man implores Igor to take care of his wife and children. The boy listens apparently unmoved but then nods almost imperceptibly and impulsively mumbles a fateful phrase ""I promise you."" That film might have been called ""The Kid With a Conscience."" In ""The Kid With a Bike"" Mr. Renier plays Cyrils father whos not so much vile as obtuse and hopelessly selfish. Its anguishing to see his indifference to the son who needs him desperately but anguish is far outweighed by the rewards of watching a story in which bonds of trust are severed only to be replaced by new ones. Working on a scale thats minuscule by studio standards the Dardenne brothers have made yet another movie that does what Hollywood used to do--keep us rapt and leave us grateful. Boy Five years ago Taika Waititi a New Zealander of mixed Maori-European ancestry made ""Eagle vs. Shark"" an endearingly odd romantic comedy. His new film ""Boy"" is no less odd but its also super-exuberant and super-affecting thanks to the pairing of James Rolleston as the boy of the title and the filmmaker as his father. Watch a clip of ""Boy"". Set on the east coast of New Zealand in the year 1984 Boy an 11-year-old kid and devout Michael Jackson fan gets a chance to know his father who has returned to find a bag of money he buried years ago. Video courtesy of Paladin. The time is 1984 and the setting is a poor Maori community on tribal lands in the unspoiled East Cape region of New Zealands North Island. Its the town where Mr. Waititi grew up and the only trace of another culture in his film comes when a column of white cyclists suddenly whizzes across a bridge and promptly vanishes. Boy an 11-year-old who idolizes Michael Jackson lives in a ramshackle house with his younger brother Rocky and several cousins. (Boys given name which he shares with his father is Alamein a reference to the World War II battle where a Maori battalion fought with allied forces.) The siblings mother is dead their father hasnt been seen for years and the grandmother who cares for them has gone out of town for a funeral. Suddenly Alamein senior shows up with a couple of buddies and an assortment of presents in the trunk of his car. Far from being a repentant parent on the upswing let alone the shining hero of Boys imaginings the father is a goony stoner shameless prevaricator and scuzzy crook who has come home to dig up a bag of money that hed buried years ago in a nearby field. ENLARGE Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu James Rolleston and Taika Waititi in Boy. Unison Films Mr. Waititi a popular standup comic in New Zealand is wonderfully droll and entertaining in this acting role which isnt all that far geography and culture notwithstanding from Steve Zahn at his stoner best. As a director of actors hes exceptionally good with his young star--your heart goes out to Boy when he does awkward approximations of Michael Jackson moves to impress a girl named Chardonnay--and also with Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu who plays the tender and imaginative Rocky. As a filmmaker Mr. Waititi makes good use of a seemingly casual anything-goes style; some scenes are punctuated by spasms of magic realism and studiedly naive animation. And the movie has been beautifully photographed by Adam Clark even though listening to it can be problematic--the accents are strong and the young nonprofessional actors sometimes fall into piping singsong speech patterns. For all its jovial trappings however ""Boy"" is a comedy with a serious core. Its another case of a son having clung to an idealized notion of his father and in a stunning climax and an exquisite coda coming of age as he comes to grips with wounding truths. 21 Jump Street A pair of underachieving cops are sent back to a local high school to blend in and bring down a synthetic drug ring. Video courtesy of Columbia Pictures. ENLARGE Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill in 21 Jump Street. Sony Pictures This cheerfully chaotic gleefully vulgar action-comedy retread of the old television series has box-office success written all over it and wheres the harm? Its irresistibly funny until it isnt. The resistible parts are mainly the action sequences though theres a good running joke about big explosions that dont happen until one does. The most agreeable parts turn on the unlikely affection that grows between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as screw-up cops and reluctant buddies who are manifestly unqualified for the undercover work theyre assigned to do. Their assignment as fans of the series may recall requires them to pass for high-school students; in this version theyre searching the school for users and distributors of a new drug. Mr. Hill might pass on a day without sunshine in a classroom without lights but Mr. Tatum could well be mistaken for a teacher or parent a situation Michael Bacalls clever script addresses frequently by noting its patent absurdity. The script is particularly smart in contrasting what used to be cool back in the day when the two men were bona fide high-school students and whats cool in the more sophisticated here and now. (Johnny Depp who starred in the original series is neither forgotten nor entirely gone.) ""21 Jump Street"" was directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller and is dominated in a pleasantly understated way by Mr. Tatum who has the school smarts--as distinct from street smarts--to underplay his role whenever possible. Ice Cubes nasty police captain on the other hand would be consistently over the top if the movie had a top to be over. Jeff Who Lives at Home Dispatched from his basement room on an errand for his mother slacker Jeff might discover his destiny (finally) when he spends the day with his brother as he tracks his possibly adulterous wife. Video courtesy of Paramount Vantage. Before I say anything nice about this short and semisweet feature by Jay Duplass and Mark Duplass--its a big week for filmmaker brothers--I want to go on record as being highly resistant to fey contrivance glib poignancy and almost all things concerning man-child pothead slackers who pass their days on sofas not growing up. That might seem a perfect description of this film; its very title constitutes a poignancy alert. Surprisingly though most of the material avoids the treacle zone while Jason Segel as the man-child in residence gives a performance that I can only describe as gravely affecting. An obsessive admirer of the M. Night Shyamalan film ""Signs"" Jeff keeps looking for signs to answer the existential question haunting us all What am I supposed to do? The signs he sees however are so inscrutable and his reactions so bizarre that his mother Sharon (Susan Sarandon) and his brother Pat (Ed Helms) have all but written him off as a participant in what passes for real life. Yet they have their problems too the most infuriating being Pats epic insensitivity to the needs of his wife Linda (a fine performance by Judy Greer). Compared with Pat Jeff comes off as only mildly disadvantaged in the clarity department. ""I cant help wonder about my fate"" he says ""my destiny."" I couldnt help caring about him. DVD Focus ENLARGE Rosetta (1999) Much darker than ""The Kid With a Bike this Dardenne brothers drama has for its heroine a stocky girl of Italian extraction; she is played by 18-year-old Emilie Dequenne in a remarkable film debut. Rosetta lives with her drunken mother in a Belgian trailer park suffers terribly from an unspecified internal upset and yearns with all her heart to have a regular job and a normal life. Usually hostile and sometimes rageful Rosetta pursues her narrow goals quite ruthlessly while the movie keeps questioning tacitly the moral choices that she makes to escape from intolerable circumstances. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (2009) Phil Lord and Chris Miller directed this animated feature and adapted the script from the childrens book by Judi and Ron Barrett. The story explores the question of why rainfall in a certain small town has been replaced by foodfall. (Global warming isnt the answer.) Those who dislike the film focus on its ludicrous premise. Those who admire it do so because it remains true to its ludicrous premise. The voice cast includes Bill Hader Anna Faris James Caan Benjamin Bratt Neil Patrick Harris and Al Roker who knows a thing or two about the secrets of the skies. Baghead (2008) Very short and amiably scruffy this comedy-thriller by Jay and Mark Duplass starts with a couple of marginally talented young actors who figure that anyone can make a movie so they will too. The movie they try to make is a horror story about a man with a bag over his head. The movie the Duplass brothers have made is a parody of indie films with special reference to ""The Blair Witch Project"" as well as a horror-ish entertainment with a silly-ish payoff. Among the members of the engaging cast are Steve Zissis Ross Partridge Greta Gerwig and Elise Muller.

Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures 21 Jump Street Directors Phil Lord Chris Miller Genre Comedy Running Time 109 minutes Rated R for crude and sexual content pervasive language drug material teen drinking and some violence With Jonah Hill Channing Tatum Ice Cube Rob Riggle Watch Clips From 21 Jump Street - Miranda Rights Miranda Rights Credit Sony Pictures From 21 Jump Street - Stereotypes Stereotypes Credit Sony Pictures From 21 Jump Street - Fight Fight Credit Sony Pictures It was inevitable that one of Hollywoods many recent reboots would eventually attain sentience. Hence the arrival of 21 Jump Street a film that not only knows its a remake but knows how absurd it has to be to succeed as a remake. This particular edition of ""Hey youve seen this before"" is based on an 80s TV series about cops who posed undercover as high school students -- a show that far fewer people would remember now if it hadnt starred a young Johnny Depp. In fact the impetus for this reawakening is so transparently flimsy that the movie acknowledges as much with a shrug ""They lack creativity"" a deputy (Nick Offerman) tells incompetent cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) when explaining why the police department is reviving ""a canceled program from the 80s."" Any other objections over the premises absurdity? 21 Jump Street will dismiss them too. Tatum looks way too old to pass for 17 -- which his teachers acknowledge. Ice Cube plays a stereotypical angry black police captain -- but dont tell it to his face. Schmidt and Jenko are welcomed as new students only a month before prom -- whatever man. Want to see some explosions? The devil-may-care attitude is what makes 21 Jump Street so entertaining. With no need to feign loyalty to their source material directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller can shove together a bunch of outrageously contrived set pieces just to see what happens. Neither Hill nor Tatum has any interest in channeling a young-Depp smolder so instead they bounce casually off each other with the ease of faded jeans in the spin cycle riffing on everything from Miranda rights to proper car-chase technique. Hill is reliably entertaining here still able to wring laughs from awkward vulgarity even after his serious Oscar-nominated number-crunching in Moneyball. But Tatum is the real surprise Generally better known for pure-muscle roles in films like Step Up and G.I. Joe the former stripper proves he has adept comic chops. When he reveals a long-held prom fantasy (it involves doves) theres a yearning in his eyes that is all the funnier for its believability. Schmidt and Jenko try to convince popular kid -- and suspected drug dealer -- Eric (Dave Franco) that theyre just regular high school students. Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures 21 Jump Street takes special pleasure in subverting expectations. Despite Ice Cubes early instructions to ""embrace your stereotypes"" Schmidt and Jenko end up embracing each others due to a careless mix-up on the first day of school making Hill the cool kid and Tatum the nerd. And as they attempt to reinvent themselves on the fly the duo become amazed to learn how much high school has changed. The drug dealers drive hybrids no one calls each other on the phone anymore and its no longer acceptable to exert your dominance by face-punching the first guy who looks at you funny. Its a premise that cleverly subverts the movies reason for being Just because youve done it before doesnt mean youll know how to do it again. Screenwriter Michael Bacall who shares a story credit with Hill also co-wrote another 2012 teen raunch-com the grotesquely sleazy Project X. How to explain why this one works when that one didnt? 21 Jump Street subverts expectations again by respecting its characters enough to give them motivations and personality instead of simply pumping them full of substances. Though the movie has its fair share of those too In the funniest scene Schmidt and Jenko ingest while at school the very drug theyre supposed to be putting a stop to. Is the film too long? Does it go for the easy laugh a few too many times? Whatever man. If remakes must exist they all should try to jump this high.

Or stop laughing. Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""21 Jump Street"" thrilled me to itsy-bitsy elated pieces. The Reagan-era TV series that inspired this inspired comedy was serious about its laughable premise. A team of young-looking police officers went undercover as high school students to investigate youth-related crimes. In the revival Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play high school antagonists turned police academy grads who find themselves thrown together in an identical back-to-school operation. Their captain (Nick Offerman of NBCs ""Parks and Recreation"") explains the program was revived because ""the people who think these things up have no creativity or imagination. All they do now is recycle [stuff] from the past and expect us not to notice."" Recognizing the shamelessness of its own premise and holding it up to ridicule is one of the reasons this is a model spoof. There are plenty of old jokes and stock situations in the script but the movie hits them from new angles with a gusto thats downright startling. Even when the material isnt fresh its spun in ways that catch us off-guard. Thrills farce flashes of genuine emotion -- this movie really knows how to party. The dual protagonists are ideally mismatched and played to a T. With his high-pitched jabber Hill carries the verbal humor. Tatum the jock lunkhead throws himself into the storys physical comedy with the frenetic zeal of a rodeo clown. Re-enrolled in high school to bust a drug ring they find themselves reliving the insecurities and jealousies that plagued them a decade before. Hill chokes up and stammers around girls; Tatum has his pretty chemistry teacher hyperventilating but hes embarrassed that hes not really you know smart. But the busy well orchestrated script (co-written by Hill) doesnt stop there. The tough-guy posturing that made Tatum high school royalty back in the day is passe. Todays students are hardworking and enlightened and politically correct. Now Hill hangs with the hip crowd while Tatum languishes with the nerds. ""Its because of Glee. Damn you Glee"" he grouses. Tatums heart splinters when he overhears Hill call him ""Rain Man"" without the math skills. The way he makes big sad teddy bear eyes at Hill afterward is plaintive and goofy all at once. Directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"") ""21 Jump Street"" deconstructs itself as it sprints along mining irony from the conventions of romcoms buddy-cop flicks and fish-out-of-water comedies. Theres a triple-layer gag about egregious car-chase explosions. Ice Cube delivers bug-eyed intensity as a short-tempered police captain whos well aware that hes a stereotype incarnate. Hill lands the title role in the schools disastrous production of ""Peter Pan"" a nod to the forever-young premise of the film itself. Then comes a prom-night climax almost as blood-spattered as the one in ""Carrie"" and a whole lot funnier. ""21 Jump Street"" goes to obvious places for cheap laughs and stoops for several giggly gross-outs but more often it zonks us with loopy eccentric ingenuity.

We have lots of terminology for what happens when two male stars appear to have the platonic hots for each other. The genre is called bromance. The feelings are bromantic. The orientation is bromosexuality.What Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have in ""21 Jump Street scrambles transcends and explodes all of that.They play nincompoop cops undercover as brothers named Doug and Brad. Theyre trying to infiltrate and bust up a high school drug ring. To prove theyre not narcs the dealer Eric (Dave Franco) forces them to take the drug an individually wrapped wafer that looks like a Ritz cracker. Its called HFS stands for a hilariously unprintable exclamation and produces a kind of buffet-style all-you-can-tweak high.They swallow race to a bathroom stall and kneel over the same toilet shoving their hands down their throats in an attempt to purge the drug. But they cant. Then one suggests they each try to make the other throw up which results in the ecstatic experience of watching Hill and Tatum frantically jam one hand down the others throat. The comedy of the predicament is a surprise. For one thing the image is chaotic but pleasingly symmetrical with each man on either side of the stall conjoined by extended arms. For another theyve found a way to use the body to make us laugh while both alluding to the hassle of eating disorders and sending up the physical complications of certain types of unconventional sex.So much is going on in that moment and yet the sight of these two going at each other is beyond ready language. What theyre doing to their bodies just does something to yours. Thats good comedy and for an exhausting stretch good comedy is all ""21 Jump Street does.That scene sets the mood for the sequence that follows in which they proceed to freak out. The movie has already shown in a very funny Internet home video all that the drug can do. When Doug and Brad reach a new level of their trip the screen announces the stage in eruptive Day-Glo the way it might when youve reached a new level of a video game. They make their way from class to class increasingly out of their minds. Doug (Hill) blasts into an audition for the school play that minutes before he was too shy to attempt. He magnificently ruins a track meet in part by simulating lewdness with a baton. Meanwhile Brad (Tatum) a strapping idiot stands at the front of his chemistry class and fills the whiteboard with museum-quality gibberish. He arrives in band practice and proceeds to hurl himself through the ring of a gong. Their high is our high. Michael Bacall wrote ""21 Jump Street which the directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have made with both energy and precision. Bacall devised the movie with Hill and its not a remake of the old Fox television show as much as a continuation - at least three of its stars have cameos as older versions of their characters. The movies high school assignment begins by way of apology. Brad and Dougs boss (Nick Offerman) says this narc programs been resurrected because the department is out of ideas. You titter but you worry. Its been 15 minutes and the movie already doesnt think much of itself. But thats throat-clearing for the many things Bacall would like to achieve.One is a conscious joke about high school evolution which doubles as a comment on social progress. Doug and Brads real names are Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko. Seven years ago they went to the same high school. Schmidt was a geek with a ravers flared jeans and Eminems haircut. Jenko was his bully. In the police academy they fall in a kind of love with each other but as Doug and Brad living as roommates in the Schmidt family home Doug worries that Brad will revert to his old self. Actually Schmidt was supposed to be the nerdy Brad and Jenko the athletic matinee idol. But they confused their undercover ruses so on top of the other ideas ""21 Jump Street is also a variation on the body-swap comedy.From the minute Doug and Brad park their car its clear the high school landscape has been redrawn. Brad causes a scandal when reassuming his passe dumb-jock role he punches out a kid (Justin Hires) for listening to ""gay music. The kid is black and actually is gay which means Brad committed a double hate crime. That character is also part of the cool popular smart clique which includes Eric whos the drug dealer but also an environmentalist and Molly (Brie Larson) a theater nerd whos fooling around with Eric but has a crush on Doug. That redistricting extends to the narcs. Doug can now experience the chic of being a geek while Brad spends time bonding with the nerds.These are sophisticated observations that play as cheap gags. Most of the movie tries for that. Not everything in it works. Ice Cube plays the angry-black-captain role and atones for it by demanding that all the characters embrace their stereotypes. But he has the only one and hes so far past his days as an anti-LAPD anarchist that the casting no longer has any irony. Its the opposite of whats smartest about this movie which wants to erase the boundaries of the stereotype. That was the most interesting aspect of the TV show which made Holly Robinson Peete Dustin Nguyen Peter DeLuise and Johnny Depp equal partners in rescuing teens from various moral and social scourges. A lot of remakes would try to find the camp in that achievement to make a ""Brady Bunch movie. This one extends that progress. Not much gets between Hill and Tatum - not the action-movie highway-chase parody nor the support offered by Ellie Kemper Chris Parnell Rob Riggle and the peerless Caroline Aaron as Schmidts mother. The movies have been trying to make Tatum into some kind of leading man but if hes to be a bigger star his best route there runs crooked. Hes neither a convincing romantic hero (not a conventional one anyway) nor a persuasive action figure. Theres a lunatic twinkle in him that in ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints and ""The Dilemma had been demanding to be let loose. He knows about 300 ways to play dumb and this movie lets him try them all.Hill is looking for alternate approaches to comedy. He appears to have outgrown shouting profanities. Now hes backing into adulthood by feeling and emoting. Hes struggling to get control of his lunacy.Neither man has had a better foil. They are literally and figuratively trying to bring something out of each other and they do. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith had this kind of chemistry in the ""Bad Boys movies where Smiths cool seemed to push Lawrence to some new unstable height. With them there never seemed to be a true straight man comedically and to some extent sexually. They were in an undisguised love.The movies Hill has made with Michael Cera and Seth Rogen helped popularize the idea of the so-called bromance. But in those relationships there was a tension about not wanting to seem too gay. ""21 Jump Street says goodbye to all of that. At some point Doug asks Brad to the prom and theres no panic in the invitation or awkwardness in the acceptance only affection and sincerity.The movie may not be consciously exploiting the evolution of male buddydom in Hollywood the way its gone from implicitly gay to uncomfortably and defensively straight from Butch and Sundance to Rogen and Rudd. Its possible that when Tatum leaps onto a bed and pretends to thrust himself into Hill its just an actor having fun with his image. But its also more than that. Its a star releasing decades of man-to-man movie tension by mocking the discomfort in an utterly natural way.Just as the high school movie factions have evolved ""21 Jump Street argues that so too must the cop movie.

Media San Francisco Chronicle 21 Jump Street Comedy. Starring Jonah Hill Channing Tatum and Ice Cube. Directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) From the beginning a ""21 Jump Street"" movie was a collective groan of a concept. Beloved by a generation of teens who didnt know any better the 1980s show was probably one Johnny Depp casting call away from being quickly canceled and forgotten. As far as unnecessary remakes go you could make a stronger argument for ""B.J. and the Bear."" The filmmakers seemed to feel the same way and their open disdain for conventions liberates the movie. This is a consistently funny film which is good. But the true achievement is that it occasionally feels original. ""21 Jump Street"" for anyone whose parents would only let them watch PBS from 1987 to 1991 was a Fox Network TV show about a group of young-looking cops who infiltrated high school crime rings. With a talented and memorably pretty cast including Depp and Holly Robinson it was easy to look past the repetitive story lines and overload of sincerity. The ""21 Jump Street"" movie takes the name and the part about the high schools and then mocks pretty much everything else - with plenty of success. If writers Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill watched the show they never took it seriously. You can almost see them on a couch in college smoking dope and laughing about the fact that co-star Dustin Nguyen was registering for high school when he looked 35 years old.

Photo Scott Garfield Columbia Pictures 21 Jump Street review Mockery liberates remake 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The cops here are strapping Jenko (Channing Tatum) and dorky smart guy Schmidt (Hill). Rivals in high school they develop a nice chemistry in the police academy and get forced into duty at the Jump Street program. From there comedy takes precedence over story cohesion in the tradition of other recommendable narrative messes including ""Pineapple Express"" and ""Anchorman."" Phil Lord and Chris Miller approach the film more like camp counselors than filmmakers directing ""21 Jump Street"" as if they were paid by the tangent and non sequitur. For 10 minutes or so the movie is a pretty good satire of sanctimonious teens in 2012. (Jenko is ostracized for his muscle cars bad mileage; the cool kids have cars that run on french fry oil.) Other scenes take aim at the slow-motion flying doves in John Woo movies and the kinds of vehicles that explode in car chases. Why is there a biker gang in this film? Why not? Tatum will get plenty of credit for holding his own with the comedy; every one of his scenes with a deputized trio of chemistry nerds is excellent. But screenwriter Bacall is the secret weapon here. He also had a hand in ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" and you get the impression that with a little bit of free rein he could make anything funny. A ""T.J. Hooker"" remake? ""Hello Larry The Movie."" If Bacall were attached Id give it a shot. This film is even better if you come in with no spoilers and low expectations so we will build it up no more. Know that it earns its R rating mostly because of language and violence. And staying as cryptic as possible we offer the following advice for fans of the original ""21 Jump Street"" Make sure you take your bathroom break before the prom starts.

It takes the premise of its television forebear - baby-faced cops go undercover as 12th-graders in order to bust high school drug dealers - and turns it inside out. When these rookie policemen go undercover each gets a high school do-over. Back in 2005 when they were seniors brainiac Schmidt (Jonah Hill) dressed like a not-so-Slim-Shady version of Eminem and was way uncool. Brain-baked Jenko (Channing Tatum) resembled Sk8er Boi and was way hot. In police academy the former rivals reconnect. First they are study buddies Schmidt tutors Jenko on written exams while Jenko prods Schmidt to exercise for the physical tests. Whatever their beat the stubby Schmidt and studly Jenko are complementary in their strengths although Jenko wouldnt know his Miranda Rights from Carmen Miranda. Because their first assignment as bicycle patrolmen is less than a success they get assigned to Capt. Dickson (Ice Cube) a self-identified ""angry black man"" who tells his multiracial charges to ""embrace your stereotypes."" In this meta-buddy-cop-movie that religiously observes the conventions of the genre while cheerfully desecrating them Dickson looks at Jenko and observes ""Youre handsome and probably dumb."" Then he looks at Schmidt and says ""Youre probably short insecure and good with money."" Then Dickson dispatches the smart cop and his none-too-swift partner back to high school. Because of a clerical error Schmidt finds himself in the drama department and Jenko with the chemistry nerds. Given the changes in high school culture the qualities that made Schmidt an outsider when he was a senior now admit him to the in crowd. Alas for Jenko meatheadedness is so 2005. Written by Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgrim v. The World) from a story idea by Hill Jump Street wants to be all things to all moviegoers and pretty much succeeds. Its a high school parody a stoner comedy a mismatched-cop yarn trading-places merriment and buddy-buddy action/adventure. Not every director could pull this off but Phil Lord and Chris Miller makers of the enjoyable 2009 animation Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs frame it like a live-action cartoon. They are fortunate in the team of Tatum and Hill as the extreme jock and the exaggerated nerd. They embrace the stereotypes while investing them with actual personalities. See Schmidts poker-faced thrill at running with the cool kids (who include Dave Franco the enigmatic real-life younger brother of the enigmatic James). See Jenko socially marginalized for the first time for the first time understanding what it must have felt like for Schmidt to be ostracized by classmates. That this loud profane drug-infused affair has performances of such empathy makes its comedy all the more hilarious. For all its raunch and noise its endearingly funny.

Comments click to enlarge 21 Jump Street Video Rated R  110 minutes  2012 Loosely based on the TV series this lowbrow comedy looks like it was shot in about a week which would explain why some jokes have an off-the-cuff appeal and others just feel half-assed. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play inept New Orleans cops who pose as high school students to bust a drug operation; much of the humor involves trotting out cliches from cop movies and teen movies then commenting on how dumb they are. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs) seem to be after the gentle irreverence of David Gordon Greens buddy flick Pineapple Express but without his sensitivity and attention to character the movie quickly grows monotonous.

Mine lacked thugs-in-training flirtatious teachers and warring cliques more ferocious than the Crips and the Bloods. I dont recall any ritual humiliations -- you know jocks thumping some shy nerd against a locker. Our school was in what might have been called a rough neighborhood but we werent preyed on by taunting townies. And though some of the kids had started to drink nobody pushed dope in the study hall. The place was less like The Blackboard Jungles North Manual High more like the sedate Hailsham in Never Let Me Go. Watching high-school movies -- almost any high-school movie from Porkys through the John Hughes oeuvre to the genres current apotheosis and parody 21 Jump Street -- makes me wish that student unrest had been part of the curriculum at old St. Joes or at least an extracurricular activity. That way I could see the tropes in these films as sweet or painful personal flashbacks rather than cinematic conventions as remote from my experience as a Western gunfight or a Martian romance. As it is though every teen movie looks to me as if it were set in a school called Fantasy High where the students are all in their mid-20s or older. They must have been left back about 11 times. (MORE The All-TIME 100 TV Shows) One of the appeals of 21 Jump Street -- a rough comic makeover of the 1987 Stephen J. Cannell TV series about young cops working undercover in high schools and whose only justification was that it starred Johnny Depp in his showbiz infancy-- is that it tilts some of the cliches in the general direction of my rosy memories. The girls are nice and the boys are good looking at Sagan High which two raw Officers  -- the dumb jock Jenko (Channing Tatum) and the clever misfit Schmidt (Jonah Hill) -- have just infiltrated to bust a suspected drug lord. Yet the school seems like Eden with studious and socially enlightened kids. ""Environmental awareness being tolerant"" Schmidt says in wonder. ""If only Id been born 10 years later"" Meaning he wouldnt have got beat up so frequently. Of course the students liberal maturity is a joke too one of them pretty-boy Eric (Dave Franco younger brother of actor James but a visual sibling to Tom Cruise or maybe the grandson of Montgomery Clift) is peddling a hellacious hallucinogen known as HFS. Whos the ringmaster? That mild mystery is the only engine of narrative propulsion in the waywardly witty screenplay by teen-film specialist Michael Bacall. Instead of a comic-book rewrite (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) or a found-footage version of American Pie (Project X) Bacall tackles the umpteenth revival of a minor old TV series. Hill a producer and cowriter of the picture takes a protective preemptive strike at the audience whos seen all this a hundred times before by anticipating its restlessness and saying ""All they do is recycle sh-t from the past... and expect us not to notice."" The trick of a genre parody is to set low expectations and then exceed them. That can be considered a breakthrough in a movie age when originality is measured by how many twists can be made within a straitjacket format. So 21 Jump Street gets points for simultaneously inhabiting two over-familiar genres the high-school film and the buddy-cop comedy. Enemies back in their own school days Schmidt and Jenko are forced together when they meet as police recruits. Jenko whose mastery of the Miranda law is a little thin (""You have the right to remain an attorney..."") is discouraged to find that cop school is kind of like high school. ""I really thought this would have more car chases and explosions"" he says ""and less homework."" Schmidt has the same feeling on his first attempted bust he is injured in the line of duty -- an elbow burn. Its like an on-the-job wedgie. (MORE The Top 10 Macho Movie Posses) Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller old Dartmouth classmates from the 90s previously did the animated feature Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. Without much fanfare they managed to make the movie to live-action films with a tad more insouciance than Brad Bird (The Incredibles Ratatouille) brought to Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol and a lot less strenuously than Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo WALLE) in last weeks John Carter. Lord and Miller get the two stars camaraderie clicking and draw twinkly performances from ingenue Brie Larson (who manages to channel Shirley MacLaine and Renee Zellweger in their blooming phases) and Ellie Kemper (Bridesmaids) as a teacher hot for Jenko. An alumnus of Judd Apatow High Hill applies a few lessons that no comedy maven need learn the movie runs closer to two hours than to the ideal running time of 90 mins.; it includes the needless Act 3 in an Apatovian bromance in which the two guys have to break up so they can make up; and it; and it ends with the requisite gross-out joke -- the well-Ive-never-seen-that-before sight gag meant to secure appalled-delighted word-of-mouth. In fact the project loses traction toward the end as the picture strains to become a full-blooded action film -- the very thing it spends the rest of its time mocking. And yet 21 Jump Street earns my genial nod because of its limber 120-IQ take on the whole notion of movie revivals. As Schmidt and Jenkos angry supervisor (Ice Cube) commands ""Embrace your stereotypes."" Theyre not my stereotypes but for a while they had me thinking I should have matriculated at Fantasy High.

Only a relatively small die-hard audience remembers ""21 Jump Street"" the cop drama which aired on the nascent FOX network from 1987 to 1991. But a great many more viewers will have a fondness for ""21 Jump Street"" the new action-comedy movie. Also read Jeff Who Lives at Home Review Funny ... and Surprisingly Surprising The film mildly lampoons the ludicrous premise of the TV show before using it as a jumping-off point for an inspired and wonderfully silly tale of two 20-something pals who would in the final analysis happily trade their guns and badges for another chance to be the popular kids in high school. We first meet Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) as high-school seniors in 2005; Jenko mocks the nerdy Eminem-wannabe Schmidt for being too dorky to get a prom date only to find out moments later that thanks to his terrible grades he wont be attending the big dance either. Cut to seven years later where the two meet again as classmates at the ""Metropolitan City Police Academy."" (The generic location becomes one of the films better running gags down to billboards that read ""Watch a Movie"" or just ""Billboard."") Jenko helps whip Schmidt into shape and Schmidt tutors Jenko through the tests and the two become best pals. When they screw up their first big post-graduate arrest they get assigned to the Jump Street station for an undercover program that hasnt been around since the 80s. (""All they can do is recycle old ideas"" complains their superior officer played by Nick Offerman in an amusing cameo.) Jump Street has the requisite angry African-American police captain (Ice Cube) and the duo gets sent to infiltrate a high school where a new designer drug is making the rounds. Schmidts fake transcripts say hes a science whiz while Jenko gets enrolled in gut classes but since the two cant bother to remember their undercover identities they wind up switching places allowing Schmidt to get his first taste of popularity while Jenko hangs out with the smart geeks. All this plotting merely provides a framework for a series of hilarious set pieces from a wild house party (the screenplay is by Michael Bacall the writer behind teen bacchanal ""Project X"") to a prom-night car chase involving three stretch limos. But ""21 Jump Street"" is also smart about its characters from the cops getting caught up in the idea of a high school do-over to the Class of 2005s cluelessness about things like texting tolerance environmentalism and the increasing amount of fragmented sub-cliques. Coming off the debacle of ""The Sitter"" Hill shows a real comic assuredness here and Tatum delivers on the comic promise he demonstrated as the only funny element of last years ""The Dilemma."" Most of the supporting characters are drawn as broadly as possible but Dave Franco (brother of James) makes an impression as a high-school drug dealer whos also concerned about the environment and his early acceptance to Stanford. The makers of ""21 Jump Street"" clearly understood that almost nobody really wanted a ""21 Jump Street"" movie -- although there are some cameos and inside jokes that fans of the original will appreciate -- and theyve cleverly used a familiar property as a way to get a wildly entertaining new comedy made.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 15 2012 1247 PM Title 21 Jump Street Film Info R Language violence. At area theaters. A movie like ""21 Jump Street"" seems at first glance to be begging to be graded on a curve. Its a big-screen update of the late 80s/early 90s TV series thats mainly remembered for launching Johnny Depps career and a kicky title still connected to the era of big shoulder pads. It stars Channing Tatum who has never seriously been funny before and Jonah Hill whos coming off an Oscar nomination for deliberately being serious. And its co-directors have only made the animated ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."" But big surprise The sometimes chaotic ""Jump Street"" is a lot of ridic fun as the kids say turning predictability on its head. In a brief prelude Tatums Jenko and Hills Schmidt are glimpsed as 2005 high schoolers with clueless dude Jenko laughing as dorky Schmidt tries to ask a girl out and bombs. Flash-forward six years and theyre rookie cops paired up and assigned to the 21 Jump Street unit. Their foul-mouthed captain (a hilarious Ice Cube) berates em hates em and plunks em into a high school going undercover as brothers to find out whos behind a dangerous underground drug. But when they hit the hallways Schmidt and Jenko find teen life has changed. Now the cool kids study. Eco-consciousness and ""two-strapping"" your backpack are in. Diversity is accepted and geeks are hot. When their false IDs get mixed up they get a chance to do things differently attend the senior prom that they both missed -- and blast away the bad guys. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller keep things moving -- theres little of the off-topic riffing that categorizes comedies nowadays -- and turns the movie into a kind of cinematic Red Bull Every time it could get slogged down its amped up again with very funny and often very loud payoffs. The cops have to stay with Schmidts parents? Boom  heres an old lady who needs to be whomped before she blows their cover. Theres a midfilm freeway car chase? Its in a Drivers Ed car which comes equipped with passenger-side brakes. Depp has a cameo -- but he damn sure wont be able to be in a sequel. Through it all Tatum and Hill are totally winning. The latter has had a tough time transitioning from the chunky guy so funny in ""Superbad"" to funny adult which is why ""Moneyball"" was a revelation. Here he makes the leap ironically to grownup comedy. And Tatum ought to only do comedies. Forget the dramas weepy romances and action flicks -- this guy ought to be sitting with the class clowns.

In theaters in March 16 2012. Photo Credit Columbia Pictures/Scott Garfield advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two bumbling cops go back to high school disguised as students. BOTTOM LINE A likable send-up of the teen genre with Hill and Tatum making an effective and even endearing comic team. CAST Jonah Hill Channing Tatum Brie Larson Ice Cube LENGTH 143 Jonah Hill is entering dangerous waters with ""21 Jump Street"" an intentionally comedic spin on the straight-faced late-1980s Fox television series. Starring a 20ish Johnny Depp as an undercover cop improbably blending in with high-schoolers the show was a good example of the hilarity that ensues when show biz oldsters try to speak ""teen."" Hill though a youthful 28 is not only mocking a mockery hes also facing some of the same hokey old traps. But the saving grace of ""21 Jump Street"" co-written and produced by Hill is its obvious affection for teen genres and for teenagers. Though ostensibly an action-comedy with car chases and gunfights the movie works best as a commentary on the ever-changing and always baffling rules of youth culture with Hill and Channing Tatum as the bumbling cops Schmidt and Jenko who are sent back to school to mix mingle and stop crime. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break The best jokes are in the setup Schmidt a former outcast is delighted to find that todays popular kids are sensitive gay-tolerant types while Jenko once a bullying jock is horrified. (He blames ""Glee."") Chubby Schmidt falls in with school-ruler Eric (Dave Franco younger brother of James) and pretty Molly (an appealing Brie Larson) while the strapping Jenko is thrown in with the science geeks -- a subset that apparently never goes away. The movie mocks many a teenage trope such as a new drug with an unprintable acronym and a clear nod to the ""U4EA"" that Jason Priestly ingested in ""90210"" -- but it works better when it takes Schmidt and Jenko at least somewhat seriously. They make an endearingly likable pair and Tatum is quite sweet and funny in a role that finally focuses on more than his pecs. Even in a teen-movie spoof theres always room for sincerity.

Video21 Jump Street stars Back story How stars jumped into Street The idea of remaking ""21 Jump Street"" was pitched to Jonah Hill around the time of his success in ""Superbad."" While he was ""not a massive fan of the show"" his interest sparked when he saw it as a story of adults reverting to the immature behaviors and insecurities they thought theyd outgrown. ""The movie I was interested in creating was like Bad Boys meets a John Hughes movie"" said Hill who co-wrote the screenplay. Co-star Channing Tatum who had never before attempted comedy figured he wouldnt get a better apprenticeship than working alongside Hill. imageCaption ""He promised me hed take care of me and that was really the whole reason of me jumping on to this thing.

(AP Photo/Columbia Pictures - Sony Scott Garfield) Scott Garfield In this film image released by Columbia Pictures from left Ice Cube Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are shown in a scene from ""21 Jump Street."" (AP Photo/Columbia Pictures - Sony Scott Garfield) Channing Tatum has at least four movies slated for release this year including a ""G.I. Joe"" sequel the weepie ""The Vow"" and Steven Soderberghs ""Magic Mike"" which fictionalizes Tatums real-life rise from male stripper to movie star. But the smartest thing that this seemingly dumb hunk has done is to embrace his reputation in this comic remake of an 80s cop show.Hes not in Mark Wahlbergs league and ""21 Jump Street"" isnt quite as funny as ""The Other Guys"" but by lampooning himself here Tatum has bought himself a grace period to grow in.Neither Jenko (Tatum) nor Schmidt (Jonah Hill) have grown much since they were enemies in high school. At the police academy Schmidt is still the physically challenged brain and Jenko is still the intellectually challenged brawn but by banding together they earn their stripes. Streetwise Capt. Dickson (Ice Cube) recruits the rookie cops to go undercover at a suburban high school and break up a drug ring. But through a paperwork mix-up Jenko ends up in the math and science classes while Schmidt ends up on the track team and in the drama club.Like Tatum ""21 Jump Street"" is slightly smarter than it seems. Because the undercover cops are a decade out of step they have to face their fears and preconceptions. Social misfit Schmidt works up the courage to text message his pretty ""Peter Pan"" co-star (Brie Larson) and once-popular jock Jenko is shocked to learn its no longer cool to bully his geeky or gay classmates. But mostly the movie is juiced by crude humor and much of it sticks. Although it was written and directed by the team behind the animated family film ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" this R-rated flick is more salty than sweet. Even if you think youve graduated from genital jokes and violent slapstick the laughing gas around ""21 Jump Street"" may get you hooked.

Share Tweet The film version of 21 Jump Street might as well have ironic quotation marks around its title since damn near everything else in it does. The proudly goofy take-off on the television show that made Johnny Depp a reluctant teen idol is less an adaptation than an ""adaptation"" that delights in highlighting the ridiculous cliches and tropes it lampoons. Like the equally irreverent film version of Starsky amp; Hutch 21 Jump Street is less interested in recycling the conventions of the show its ostensibly adapting for the big screen than in exaggerating them for comic effect. Rather than pretending that 31-year-old Channing Tatum could convincingly pass for a high-school student for example the screenplay has characters repeatedly calling Tatum out for looking like a middle-aged man. 21 Jump Street leans heavily on hyper-self-awareness in ways that can be both refreshing and exhausting. For instance Ice Cube plays a one-note angry black police captain who openly acknowledges that hes a stereotype. Thats where the joke begins and thats where it ends. Jonah Hill (who also co-wrote the story with screenwriter Michael Bacall) and Channing Tatum star as former high-school adversaries who become partners and pals and are subsequently dispatched to go undercover at a high school to stop the dissemination of a powerful new designer drug. Due to a mix-up early in the assignment their classes and personas get switched Hill ends up mixing with the popular drama-class kids and trying out for the track team while Tatums giant slab of beefcake has to assimilate into the shadowy world of science-loving poindexters. In one of the films sharpest gags the previously popular Tatum is flummoxed to discover that in todays teen world his kind of chiseled brawn is out of fashion and the most popular kids are eco-friendly academic overachievers and gay African-Americans. The title and the bare-bones premise arent the only elements of the film redolent of pop cultures recent past. 21 Jump Street combines the half-forgotten conventions of the mismatched buddy-cop movies of the 80s with Clinton-era gags about political correctness. Nick Offerman helps establish a knowing giddily self-referential tone early on by telling Hill and Tatum hes assigning them to a program from the 80s that was discontinued but resurrected because the police department has completely run out of new ideas. 21 Jump Street is appropriately devoid of novel concepts (the first big ironic laugh comes when the logo for the production company ""Original Film"" appears onscreen) but its more consistently amusing and inspired than an adaptation of an 80s TV show has any right to be.

21 Jump Street Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2012) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/21-jump-street-2012,200,21jumpstreet27,21jumpstreet,rogerebert
"21 Jump Street movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 21 Jump Street takes hilarious look back with Jonah Hill Channing Tatum aaaMarch 14 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticChanning Tatum and Jonah Hill star in ""21 Jump Street.""Most of the big laughs in ""21 Jump Street""arrive in the first half but take a moment to consider that phrase ""big laughs."" What was the last stupid Hollywood comedy -- good-stupid not stupid-stupid -- to offer actual audible verifiable big laughs?Heartily raunchy and rather sweet ""21 Jump Street"" comes from the 1987-1991 Fox TV show in which Johnny Depp and his incredible swirly hair led an ensemble of younglings playing barely legal police officers posing as high school students. The movie features Jonah Hill of ""Superbad"" (back when he was a pup) and ""Moneyball"" (for which he was Oscar-nominated) co-starring with Channing Tatum. You can say a lot of things about ""21 Jump Street."" You can say Tatum is luckier than he is talented. You can say the humor isnt for you. You can say youre offended by the poster and advertising tag line which captures the spirit of the thing but which we wont repeat here lest faint hearts and fair Tribune readers get the vapors.But the movie works thanks to its odd-couple chemistry and artfully thrown-together air. Last week while everyone was speculating whether ""WallE"" director Andrew Stanton could successfully deliver his first live-action hit (answer no) with ""John Carter"" absolutely no one was speculating whether ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were up or down to the demands of their live-action feature debut. They were for the record.What puts ""21 Jump Street"" ahead of the ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" movie a few years back for example is a simple matter of modesty and scale. Early on Tatums character Jenko stuck on bike patrol with his friend and partner Schmidt (Hill) mutters ""I really thought this job would have more car chases and explosions."" They come eventually of course. But getting there is well over half the fun because the script by ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World""adapter Michael Bacall charts the shifting landscape of high school cliques and dynamics in very clever ways.Jenko and Schmidt werent friends in high school as we learn in the 2005-set prologue. Jenko was the jock triumphant and a lousy student and Schmidt (sporting an impressive mouthful of braces) spent most of his waking hours being embarrassed by his parents. A few years later graduating from the police academy together theyve become pals leaving enough of their high school selves behind to bridge the former social gap. Theyre ready in other words to test their friendship by going back to high school undercover assigned by their superior (Ice Cube snarling every second) to arrest the dealers and suppliers of a dangerous new synthetic drug.The school yearbook maven played by Dave (brother of James and its obvious) Franco is the connection. Schmidt lands the lead in the school musical (""Peter Pan"") while Jenko struggles to learn basic science concepts no picnic for a guy who never memorized the Miranda rights. ""You have a right to remain an attorney"" he tells a perp at one point.The idea behind Jenko and Schmidts disorientation relates to how much high school life has changed in a short time. ""Environmental awareness being tolerant ... if only Id been born 10 years later"" Schmidt says awe-struck. The movie takes the romance between Schmidt and the dealers sometime girlfriend (Brie Larson a great match for Hills easygoing delivery) more seriously than you expect which is also true of the tetchy friendship between our heroes the cops lost in John Hughesville. Little turns of phrase stick with you as when the drama teacher (Chris Parnell) begins a self-important lecture ""When I was a young actor starting out in New York ... state ... Albany to be exact ...""The drug humor in ""21 Jump Street"" carries its own distinction in that its actually humor. Cornered by the dealer desperate not to have their cover blown Jenko and Schmidt ingest the potentially deadly hallucinogen. Side effect No. 3 is ""over-falsity of confidence"" illustrated by Schmidts riotous acts of competitive sabotage on the track field and by Jenkos hyperviolent drum solo in band class. Were not talking ""The Philadelphia Story"" here. Its too bad ""21 Jump Street"" settles for a familiar mixture of action gore and slack pacing for its final half-hour. But if any of what I have described above sounds amusing to you well ... you have the right to remain an attorney.mjphillipstribune.com21 Jump Street -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for crude and sexual content pervasive language drug material teen drinking and some violence)Running time 149Opens Friday.

Cast Jonah Hill Channing Tatum Ice Cube. Rating R for crude and sexual content pervasive language drug material teen drinking and some violence. This weeks new movie releases There is no denying this nor that it is grossly unfair. It cant be helped. Certain actors directors or titles simply carry the weight of high hopes. And now ""21 Jump Street"" comes along to prove that the opposite can be true as well. Or maybe its just a really fun movie in its own right. When word got out that a big-screen version of one of the Fox networks first original shows was in the works the typical reaction was ""Huh?"" Followed by ""Whatever."" The show was known to the extent that it was known at all as the launching pad for Johnny Depps weird wonderful career in 1987. Now the premise of young cops sent back to high school on undercover assignments has been updated with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as the bumbling officers who need a shot at redemption. It is an idea fraught with peril. Yet directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller get nearly everything -- the tone the self-referential nods to the show and the dead-solid-perfect surprises -- just right. Plus theyve got Hill who also contributed to the story. Hill got an Oscar nomination for ""Moneyball"" of course but he still may be underappreciated. He can bring the raunchy humor of course and always could. But he proves again here that his soft gooey center is genuine and affecting. The film starts in 2005 with Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) in high school for real where Jenko is the popular dumb jock and Schmidt the hopeless fat kid who tries to look like Eminem. (Jenko later refers to him as ""Not So Slim Shady."") They suffer through some typical high-school unhappiness establishing their characters. Fast-forward to the present where the two are stumbling through police-academy training. Out of desperation the two turn to each other for help -- Schmidt has the brains Jenko the brawn -- and they manage to graduate. But even a low-level assignment proves too much for them so they are bounced to Jump Street a precinct in which young-looking cops infiltrate schools looking to solve crimes there. And thats where the self-referential humor begins. To say more would ruin the fun but the fact that this is a remake of an old show is not lost on anyone involved including the audience which is kindly clued in (on the off chance someone didnt know) from time to time. Their boss is Capt. Dickson (a hilariously grumpy Ice Cube). He assigns them to take down a synthetic-drug ring led by Eric (Dave Franco younger brother of James) which means gaining his trust. That is somewhat difficult considering -- this is a running joke -- they look way too old to be in high school. The job is made harder still by the school principal who isnt in on the plan switching their fake identities. So now Schmidt is the athletic dope and Jenko the smart nerd. Nevertheless they dive into the assignment with gusto taking the opportunity that most of us would like reliving their high-school days with the knowledge of an adult (though they dont act very grown up most of the time). And if that means smoking weed from the evidence locker with their new-found friends so be it. It sounds silly because it is. But both Hill and Tatum are surprisingly effective at getting at the regret each has. Hills been showing his sweet side since ""Superbad"" but who knew Tatum had it in him? Lord and Miller who directed ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" hit on just the right tone. Its not too serious -- even the action scenes have funny self-referential bits -- but Hill and Tatums performances make ""21 Jump Street"" way better than youd have imagined it ever could be.

"21 Jump Street | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 21-jump-street ) 21 Jump Street (United States 2012) March 14 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The television series 21 Jump Street like many old shows is a product of its time. Trying to accomplish a ""straight"" remake of something so irrevocably tied to the 80s could not be done in 2012; it wouldnt work. When Michael Mann reworked Miami Vice he discarded much of what made it ""hip"" during its TV run and concentrated on the raw premise. Thats one way to do it. Another way is go about things the way Todd Phillips did with Starsky amp; Hutch transform it into a comedy/parody. With 21 Jump Street a series one would not assume deserved a big-screen resurrection the filmmakers have opted with the latter approach. From start to finish little that happens during the course of this production is intended to be taken seriously. 21 Jump Street sends up action movies. It sends up cop movies. It sends up high school movies. It sends up motion picture conventions. Sometimes its clever. Sometimes its crude. And sometimes it falls into the trap of creating unfunny-just-for-Jonah Hill set pieces. The biggest sin is that its too long. At 90 minutes this might have been breezy and enjoyable. At 109 minutes it drags. 21 Jump Street needs a ninth-inning cameo to keep the audiences attention. Still all things considered the film is funnier than one might expect. The people behind the camera - directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who previously collaborated on Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) and scribes Hill and Michael Bacall - put some effort into transforming 21 Jump Street into something that might appeal to a current audience. This production does not rely solely upon nostalgia to get bodies into theater seats. It starts out as a mismatched buddy movie. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) is the socially inept nerd. He may be a virgin and hes certainly awkward around women. His best friend is Jenko (Channing Tatum) an easygoing handsome dumb guy who has no problems with the opposite sex. He and Schmidt bond while working their way through the police academy then become partners thereafter. When it becomes apparent they are not cut out for conventional cop work they are reassigned to the Jump Street Squad headed by the angry Captain Dickson (Ice Cube). Because they (supposedly) look younger than they are they are ideal candidates to return to high school infiltrate the student body and locate the supplier of a new designer drug. In a reversal of roles Schmidt ends up hooking up with the cool kids while Jenko falls in with the geeks. Still Schmidts unease with women is not cured by his new ""popular"" status as is proven when he interacts with Molly (Brie Larson) his co-star in a school play. But he makes contact with the local pusher Eric (Dave Franco) while Jenko tries to determine whether anyone might be using the chemistry lab to synthesize the drug. 21 Jump Street contains a few ""action scenes"" with a tongue-in-cheek approach that keeps them from becoming too tedious. The movie is ruthless in lampooning the tendency of things to blow up during car chases. This becomes a running gag with an amusing (if predictable) payoff. The script also makes repeated references to the practice of having older actors play teenagers in high school movies. Tatum is 31 pretending to be 19 but at one point hes referred to as ""looking like a 40-year-old guy."" None of the main actors are under 20 with Dave Franco (the younger brother of James) clocking in at 26 and Brie Larson the baby of the group at 21. Some of the funniest scenes belong to Ice Cubes ""angry black captain"" who goes on profane rants that would make Samuel L. Jackson proud. If theres a problem with this character however its that we expect an ironic twist that never materializes. The movie earns its R-rating by packing the script with f-bombs that add little to the proceedings. For the most part this is a PG-13 movie masquerading as something more edgy. In fact the use of profanity makes 21 Jump Street seem more juvenile than adult. The chemistry between the leads is fitful but evident. Thats a key element in even a movie as silly and lightweight as this one. Jonah Hill after having pushed the envelope and shown some acting ability in Moneyball has fallen back into his typecast role as the socially awkward outsider. Channing Tatum is charming and appealing but Im still trying to figure out whether he can act. The two are okay together but no one is going to mistake them for Felix and Oscar or Rick and Louis. They fit the mood of 21 Jump Street which is that of a fitfully entertaining but throwaway re-invention of a hopelessly outdated TV show. Yes there are laughs to be had here but I wonder whether it might be more amusing to watch episodes of the old TV show. Cutting edge drama from 1987 might look like high comedy in 2012. 21 Jump Street (United States 2012) Director Phil Lord Chris Miller Cast Jonah Hill Channing Tatum Brie Larson Dave Franco Rob Riggle DeRay Davis Ice Cube Screenplay Michael Bacall based on a story by Michael Bacall amp; Jonah Hill Cinematography Barry Peterson Music Mark Mothersbaugh U.S. Distributor Columbia Pictures Run Time 149 U.S. Release Date 2012-03-16 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Profanity Sexual Content Violence Drugs) Genre COMEDY/ACTION Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Hot Fuzz (2007) Tropic Thunder (2008) 30 Minutes or Less (2011) worse movies of this genre Hot Pursuit (2015) Date Night (2010) This Means War (2012) Three...better movies of Jonah Hill Wolf of Wall Street The (2013) Knocked Up (2007) Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) worse movies of Jonah Hill Watch The (2012) Sitter The (2011) Funny People (2009) Three...better movies of Channing Tatum Hateful Eight The (2015) Guide to Recognizing Your Saints A (2006) Haywire (2012) worse movies of Channing Tatum Vow The (2012) G.I.

Tatum is Jenko a jock-turned-cop who reluctantly teams up with his high school contemporary brainy misfit Schmidt (Hill). Together they might just last it out in the LAPD - thats if they can stop bungling arrests.One such blunder lands them at 21 Jump Street the resurrected 80s programme that places puppy-faced cops undercover in high school. Posing as brothers Jenko and Schmidt return to the halls. But it turns out times have changed.To Jenkos horror its now cool to be eco-friendly and wear your backpack with both straps. Added to that the high school pecking order puts Schmidt in with the popular kids and jock Jenko with the nerds.This twist ushers in some witty observations of that constantly evolving beast the American teenager. Meanwhile Hill is reliably amusing as the geek in awe of girls and laid-back Tatum builds on the comic chops he showed in The Dilemma. Naturally the pair end up doing everything their boss (Ice Cube) tells them not to and while a drug-taking sequence is predictable its also laugh-out-loud funny.Its a shame that 21 Jump Street falls down both on plot and action - the car chases are a real bore. Save a cameo from a certain A-lister the third act is vastly inferior. But thanks to charming leads and a smattering of laughs this is still worth a punt for fans of light buddy comedies.

The TV show that made Johnny Depp a star is little more than a jumping-off point for the big-screen ""21 Jump Street"" a rowdy raunchy update that aims for laughs over action and delivers them intermittently.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are surprisingly amusing together in a mismatched pairing of newbie cops sent undercover as high school kids to root out a drug ring. A couple of guest appearances from the TV show almost make the movie worth seeing on their own (the identity of the cameo perps has been widely reported but we wont name names here; even if youve read about them the way they pop up will be a nice surprise).The R-rated gross-out humor language and violence dont add up to the ""21 Jump Street"" you might fondly remember. But then other than for Depps presence how many people fondly remember the show anyway?This is not a property requiring respect and devotion to the source material to satisfy longtime fans so the filmmakers wisely make a ""21 Jump Street"" all their own. They dump the idea on its head poke not-so-polite fun at the original and offer a spot-on summation of Hollywoods vapid approach to remakes couching the commentary in cop jabber about reviving LAs moribund program that places youthful-looking police moles in high schools.Two of the recruits are Hills Morton Schmidt and Tatums Greg Jenko. A brisk clever prologue spells out their back-story Schmidt as a high school uber-geek Jenko as a dopey stud with the two becoming unlikely best buddies years later at the police academy.Sent back to school as undercover brothers the two flash back on old teen anxieties and encounter plenty of new ones as they struggle to fit in while tracing the source of a dangerous new hallucinogen that erodes users inhibitions in insanely comical fashion.Hill shares story credit with screenwriter Michael Bacall but what little actual story is here serves only as the setup for an anything-goes approach by the cast and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (making their live-action debut after collaborating on the animated hit ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"").Everything about the movie -- the car chases the shootouts the teen kegger the goofy idiocy of the characters -- is pushed to the extreme. Some of the absurd violence is funny some is pointlessly mean and nasty enough to jar viewers out of the action now and then.Ice Cube pops in occasionally with some foul-mouthed fun as Schmidt and Jenkos perpetually seething police captain while Brie Larson is adorably fetching as the high-school hottie Schmidt might actually have a shot with this time around.Hill and Tatums odd-couple act is the best thing about ""21 Jump Street"" both playing the straight man yet managing to make their partnership much funnier than the hit-and-miss jokes and action really are.The movies nimble pacing also helps sneaking in some slick wily tidbits and powering through the many gags that would fall flat if you had another second or two to think about them.It doesnt work all of the time or even most of the time but it does work enough of the time to make ""21 Jump Street"" more enjoyable than most of Hollywoods unimaginative remakes and updates.""21 Jump Street"" released by Sonys Columbia Pictures is rated R for crude and sexual content pervasive language drug material teen drinking and some violence.

As a sign of the irrefutable progress made since the fearmongering anti-hedonist Reagan-Bush era the mixed-bag big-screen 21 Jump Street mocks that programs lethal earnestness with retrograde raunch packing in more references to dicks and dick-sucking than 20 Manhunt profiles.The series coed mixed-race quartet (sometimes quintet) of baby-faced police officers--whod often appear in post-episode PSAs about AIDS and drug abuse--has been retooled as a white-dude buddy action-comedy that announces its cynicism from the start. After Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) rookie cops who knew each other in high school in the mid 00s botch an arrest their supervisor (Nick Offerman) reassigns them to a new detail headquartered at an abandoned church at the address of the title and described as a project from the 80s now being revamped ""All they do now is recycle shit from the past and expect nobody to notice."" (Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller whose first helming effort was Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs will continue their pop-culture composting in their next high-concept project Lego The Piece of Resistance.)Its own superfluousness readily acknowledged (a similar preemptive strategy was used in A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas last fall) 21 Jump Street tries--and sometimes succeeds--to get laughs from Schmidt and Jenkos redo of senior year as 25-year-olds. Dispatched to infiltrate a high school drug ring by Jump Streets Captain Dickson (Ice Cube whose eruptive delivery--""Theres . . . rumors . . . in the . . . Twitter-sphere . . .""--is hilarious even if the panicky peen obsession extending to character names isnt) Schmidt and Jenko go undercover as transfer students and brothers. But mixing up their aliases Schmidt a member of the Juggling Society and all-around pariah during his real high school years is in 2012 a drama-club star whose self-deprecation makes him tight with todays cool kids; Jenko a thick former varsity footballer must now fake his way through AP chemistry.The lead actors own chemistry works in part thanks to the disparity in their body types. Although radically smaller than he used to be Hill still has an endomorphs awkward carriage--an ungainliness balanced by Tatums ripped physique and taurine strength. Their chub-cop/cut-cop juxtaposition is funniest when theyre suited up in prom-night white tuxes and during a blowout they host at Schmidts parents house now the officers base. (This 10-minute tribute to adolescent debauchery tops the recently released execrable Project X co-scripted by Michael Bacall who also wrote 21 Jump Street.)But though these mismatched cops bounce well off each other Tatum in his first comedic lead role is the better performer both more riotous and affecting. The actor who was such a good sport during his hosting gig on SNL last month (which required him to make fun of his male-stripper past) mines the pathos in his meathead role the once-popular jock now plagued with insecurities seven years after graduation. ""Is this playlist too dancey?"" the slab of muscle frets to Schmidt during the party. Hill on the other hand relies on the same kind of comedic tics that have defined him since 2007s Superbad (another kind of teenage-impersonation movie made when the actor was 23) the nervous verbose overexplaining of the underconfident smart aleck. The outrageous nonsense delivered meekly gets laughs on occasion (particularly when Schmidt must make excuses for his partner during a parking-lot cold-cocking on their first day undercover) but Hill never leaves his comfort zone.The movie also stays firmly within the schizoid parameters of recent American comedy contradicting its own initial above-it-all contemptuousness--toward the source material toward itself--by becoming a sticky bro love-in. ""Make fun of people who care"" is the advice Jenko gives Schmidt as they prepare to go to high school a second time. The jock soon discovers that the disdain that served him well seven years ago no longer applies in an era of eco-conscious teens. 21 Jump Street also drops the sneering after 30 minutes ending with one cop declaring to the other ""I fuckin cherish you.""

In 1987 new-kid-on-the-block Fox attracted a teenage demographic by programming a gritty primetime show about baby-faced cops who go undercover at high schools. A quarter-century later Columbia Pictures targets the over-17 set reviving ""21 Jump Street"" as a raunchy R-rated laffer full of drug and dick jokes -- an odd choice since the radical genre switch seems best suited to those too young to have seen the original series. Still by casting Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as fish-out-of-water buffoons the irreverent result feels fresher than most 80s-show reboots effectively flipping the address Johnny Depp made famous. Hill who pitched the pics producers on attempting ""21 Jump Street"" as an action-comedy was 23 when he shot ""Superbad"" and already he looked too old to pass as a high schooler. Now 28 the star has shed his baby fat and appears undeniably adult. Pair him with Tatum 31 and theres no way teens would mistake the duo as two of their own -- a paradox that sets the tone for the films patently absurdist approach which uses our willing acceptance of ridiculous genre conventions as a clothesline on which to hang its ruthlessly immature sense of humor. High school was hell for Schmidt (Hill) a book-smart outcast with braces and a bad Eminem-style dye job. Jocks like Jenko (Tatum) had it relatively easy though both were forced to sit out prom. Thats why their first big assignment after graduating from police academy -- to infiltrate a high-school drug ring -- feels less like punishment than a chance for a ""do-over."" Older and wiser the mismatched partners plan to apply the lessons learned the first time around to the case only to discover that things have changed since they were in school. Now tolerance is cool bullying is uncouth and the popular kids (headed by Dave Franco) all look like well-coiffed extras from the Disney Channel. ""I totally know the cause Glee"" sneers Tatum who hasnt looked this comfortable onscreen since ""Step Up"" embracing the awkwardness as he attempts to blend in with the science nerds while Hills character fumbles his way through flirting with a student suspect (Brie Larson putting the blah in blonde). The operative idea here is that two guys who would have been rivals in high school have to buddy up to make it as cops. But instead of complementing one another brainy Schmidt and brawny Jenko merely bring each other down botching their first arrest attempt. After that debacle the duo are reassigned to a canceled undercover project from the 80s overseen by a surly captain (Ice Cube). ""All they do now is recycle shit from the past and expect us not to notice"" quips their chief (Nick Offerman) in a line that hints at just how little respect the script by ""Project X"" scribe Michael Bacall shows its source. (Just waitll you see how it treats Depps cameo.) Most of the humor concerns how inappropriate the language behavior and attitudes are for the high-school setting especially coming from grown men expected to act as role models When it comes time to earn the drug dealers trust they steal weed from the evidence lockup and throw the ultimate high-school party. These two may not look like teens but they sure as heck dont behave like cops. Given the cartoonish way co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller approach the premise it should come as no surprise that the two got their start in animation. Together they made the disaster-movie spoof ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" and they apply that same wink-wink sensibility to their live-action debut. Such a flip attitude serves the comedy well (the action feels more clunky) but belies just how insincerely everyone involved feels toward the storys emotional core. Maybe those raised on a diet of ""Family Guy"" dont require the courtesy of a script that cares about its main characters but why bother packaging the story as a male-bonding experience if the plan is merely to undermine it with vulgarities and homophobia? Where ""Superbad"" set the standard for mixing high-school sentimentality with gross-out humor this lesser effort seems content redefining audiences idea of ""dirty cops."" Bringing composer Mark Mothersbaugh along for the high-energy assignment the helmers make slick use of their new live-action collaborators. Considering that hardly anyone was asking for a ""21 Jump Street"" reboot theyve put their own playful stamp on it -- which just goes to show what happens when a bunch of pot-positive cut-ups get their hands on a relic of Reagan-era anti-drug hysteria. 21 Jump StreetProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures presentation in association with Relativity Media of an Original Film/Cannell Studios production.

TWITTER Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Millers comedy co-stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as a pair of cops who go undercover at a high school to bust a drug ring. Under normal circumstances the prospect of an 80s TV crime drama reworked as an R-rated action-comedy helmed by the co-directors of a family-friendly animated movie wouldnt lend itself to high expectations. The fact that the show is legendary for launching Johnny Depps career only raised the stakes. But any preconceived notions are decisively and refreshingly dashed where the feature reboot of 21 Jump Street in concerned. Not since Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg teamed up in The Other Guys has an onscreen pairing proved as comically rewarding as the inspired partnership of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as baby-faced cops who go undercover at a high school to bust a drug ring. PHOTOS 10 Biggest Book-to-Big Screen Adaptations of the Last 25 Years The laugh-out-loud upshot -- based on a story by Hill and screenwriter Michael Bacall and energetically directed by the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs duo of Phil Lord amp; Christopher Miller -- should nab big numbers for Sony. Although it doesnt open until March 16 the picture is looking to jump-start word-of-mouth with a March 12 sneak preview at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin. Setting the promising tone is a prologue taking place back in high school circa 2005 with Hills nerdy Schmidt taking fashion cues from Eminem (with not-so-Slim Shady results) and Tatums cool but clueless Jenko establishing an early adversarial relationship. Cut to the present with both graduating from the police academy and after a botched first arrest being reassigned to the long-dormant Jump Street unit overseen by the intimidating Captain Dickson (Ice Cube specializing in hilarious expletive-laden slow burns). PHOTOS Hollywoods A-List Redefined Posing as siblings () attending the same high school the two undercover cops struggle to convincingly fit in with the student body despite the readily apparent physical maturity issues especially where Tatums muscular Jenko is concerned. While on-a-roll Oscar-nominee Hill is in fine form both comedic and otherwise -- this is the role that prompted him to kick-start that significant weight loss -- its Tatum an introspective actor not thought of as an exuberant funnyman who rises to the occasion with a loose mischievous performance that amusingly plays off of Hills more earnest introvert. Brie Larson holds her own as a theater geek with trust issues and Dave Franco (James younger brother) does well as the schools gregarious drug dealer. And without blowing his cover lets just say that Officer Tom Hanson himself (Depp) manages to maintain a crowd-tickling element of surprise with his previously confirmed cameo. Co-directors Lord and Miller keep the comic pace humming along agreeably with the same sort of animated energy they provided for those raining meatballs. Ironically its during the requisite action sequences that the film loses momentum but even the de rigueur car chases and explosions are given a welcome comic tweak by the directors Bacalls casually irreverent script and Mark Mothersbaughs playful musical cues.

(Photo Christine Plenus/Courtesy of Sundance Selects) The Dardenne brothers of Belgium Jean-Pierre and Luc have moved away from the somewhat formless quality of their early work into the realm of melodrama which would be worrisome if their new films werent as good or betterheightened and purified by stronger narratives. The Kid With a Bike centers on 11-year-old Cyril (Thomas Doret) whose father has deposited him in a state-run school and decamped leaving no address. In the face of all evidence Cyril wont accept this rejection. He runs away to their now-empty flat and pounds on the door. When school counselors come he clings to the legs of a random young woman and screams for his papa and his bike. The woman is a hairdresser named Samantha (Cecile de France) who tracks down the bike (it was sold) locates the father (Seeing him stresses me out. Im starting over) and arranges to take the boy in. Why? Hollywood would demand a backstory but to the Dardennes what does it matter? She defines herself by her moral choices. The boy though is wild un-broken-in apt to lash out like a damaged pup from a shelter that you fear might have to go back. His frightening openness is evident when he falls in with a local delinquent who teaches him to clobber people and take their cash. There are hints of Pinocchio and the tragic A.I. Can Cyril become a real boy? The Dardennes have an exquisite sense of when to let their shots run on A scene in which Cyril pedals furiously away from a crime evokes his state of mind and gives you time to brood on where he has been and might be going. Despite the simplicity of the brothers technique The Kid With a Bike has deep religious underpinnings a relentless drive toward the mythos of death and resurrection. The film is not just in the tradition of Pinocchio and A.I. It is a worthy successor. Centered on youthful cops working undercover in high schools the eighties Fox TV series 21 Jump Street had a gritty vibe (Fox was new and looking to distinguish itself from the big three networks) and scripts that were painfully earnest with Johnny Depp groping his way toward a standard Method juvenile career before cultivating late-Brando-style weirdness. The movie starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum spoofs the series and plays the premise for laughs. It has a bad slapstick first act but by midpoint becomes strangely compelling tapping into the fantasy of reliving ones high-school years (which did a number on us all) and getting it right. After adjusting to the Zeitgeist zigs and zags of the seven years since they graduated fat Jonah earns a place with the popular kids and develops self-esteem while dumb hunk Channing settles in with the science nerds and learns to tap phones. Its an agreeable shambles. The best scenes feature an anti-bullying environmentalist drug dealer played by Dave Franco whos like a cross between his weirdo brother James and fifties Method neurotics like Montgomery Clift. I cant wait for his next movie. Friends With Kids Directed by Jennifer Westfeldt. R. The Kid With a Bike Directed by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne.
