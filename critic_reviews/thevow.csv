Do you take this stranger to be your lawful wedded husband? By Rex Reed  02/14/12 813pm Tatum and McAdams Til death (or mental illness) do us part? The Vow is not exactly a womans picture. Its more about how a man falls in love loses his love and gives up everything in life to focus on regaining his love. Maybe its a womans picture from a male point of view. However you slice it its a welcome loaf--far from perfect but as filling as a home-cooked meal. ""Moments of impact define who we are"" says the sculpted Channing Tatum who used to be a male stripper before he became a movie star and still looks it. Thats the kind of sappy corn syrup that passes for narration and Mr. Tatum is better playing gladiators and hell-raising soldiers than he is saying it. Hes a guy named Leo who owns a recording studio. Luscious Rachel McAdams is Paige a sculptress studying at the Chicago Art Institute. They meet cute and marry even cuter after he spells ""Move In"" with blueberries. Then on a romantic winter night under street lamps that light the snow like candles their car is rear-ended by a truck that sends Paige through the windshield. When she regains consciousness in the hospital brain damaged and wearing a Band-Aid all she remembers is her life before Leo. When he comes to her room she thinks hes her doctor. He vows to floor her with love but she feels like shes sharing space with a stranger. She doesnt even recognize him buck naked. He moves to the couch. Then her parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) take over and her long-term memory includes a vivid romance with an old boyfriend (Canadian heart throb Scott Speedman) who returns wanting his share. She falls into old habits old cocktails old favorite meals (she forgets shes a vegetarian). The most important thing she forgets is the vow she made at her wedding ""Regardless of the challenges that might come between us well always find our way back to each other."" Leo devotes his life to making Paige fall in love all over again and what I forgot is what a sucker I am for so much sincere humanity and heartbreak no matter how corny it seems. The Vow seems extra moving because its sincerity is not contrived. Its a true story and the real-life couple who experienced its trajectory are shown at the end reunited after years of effort and hard work. The writer-director Michael Sucsy is probably not old or smart enough to have seen Greer Garson and Ronald Colman in Random Harvest Mervyn LeRoys 1942 masterpiece about love and amnesia but to a ripe old movie buff like me The Vow brings back warm memories. It is nowhere as elegantly written richly endowed or inescapably human--and God knows it does not have the magic of Greer Garson--but no movie about amnesia that cuts through the hurdles of fate to declare love triumphant should be ignored as easily as some critics have dismissed this one. Chicago has never looked more luminous the actors are all appealing the characters are clean and decent and worth caring about and you go away with a glow in your heart. This movie is not for pessimists who consider sentimentality a subtle form of subversive manipulation but I embraced the feel-good heart it wears on its sleeve. At a time when were surrounded by a surfeit of cinematic pretentiousness depression vulgarity and mean-spirited violence The Vow is a welcome antidote to cynicism and a bracing tonic that proves love hasnt disappeared from the film experience completely. rreedobserver.com THE VOW Running Time 104 minutes Written by Jason Katims and Abby Kohn Directed by Michael Sucsy Starring Rachel McAdams Channing Tatum and Sam Neill 3/4 Comment Filed under Amnesia Channing Tatum love Marriage Michael Sucsy movie Movie Review Rachel McAdams Sam Neill Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2012/02/the-vow-woo-take-two/,200,thevow0,thevow,observer

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr V-DAY SPECIAL Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams in The Vow (Sony Pictures Classics) D The Vow Genre Romance Drama; Starring Rachel McAdams Channing Tatum; Release Date Wide 02/10/2012; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Posted February 21 2012 -- 1200 AM EST In some ways The Vow is just average awful -- the kind of typically gooey sub-Nicholas Sparksy romance that rolls into movie theaters each year around Valentines Day only to be hustled off the screen and forgotten as soon as February 14 has safely passed. In this years glop -- inspired the producers want you to know by true events -- a wife emerges from a coma following a car accident with no recognition of the stranger in front of her who says hes her husband. So the husband works to win her love all over again. For the record Rachel McAdams plays the wife a free spirited artist and Channing Tatum is her adoring husband a free-spirited musician. We know theyre free-spirited because he sometimes wears a straw hipster hat and she lets her hair get messy when shes working in her studio. The two stars look dewy and glossy and unexceptional bound together less by chemistry than by the ministrations of a hard-working costume designer. In an important way though The Vow is very special awful -- which is come to think of it the only reason to talk about the movie at all. Although post-coma Paige (thats the wife) cant remember anything about her marriage and doesnt recognize Leo (thats the husband) Paiges memory isnt entirely gone. She can in fact summon up her past up to about the time she was a sheltered infantilized preppy young woman from a wealthy snobbish family dutifully attending law school (per her daddys wishes) and engaged to an equally self-satisfied yuppie (Scott Speedman). The poor thing just cant remember the years when she shed her square genteel airs got out from under her parents prejudices met Leo and grew a spine. (Sam Neill bullies and coerces as Paiges father; Jessica Lange flutters uselessly a painful sight as Paiges possessive mother.) Its a tragedy really According to the hapless team who made the movie Our Paige is a relatively interesting young liberal who knows her own mind before the accident and a rather tedious girlish conservative who fusses about keeping her hair smooth afterwards. Were The Vow not the Valentines Day sop it is all heartstrings and teardrops and McAdams and Tatum I might believe that the filmmakers were up to mischief. Surely they dont mean to suggest that an embrace of conservative values -- and a fondness for headbands -- is an aftereffect of brain damage?

AMODIO. Special to Newsday + - Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams star in Screen Gems "" The Vow"" directed by Michael Sucsy a Sony Pictures release. In theaters on February102012. Photo Credit Screen Gems/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A young husband must find a way to woo his wife all over again after a car accident leaves her with amnesia. BOTTOM LINE A charming romancer that sometimes ahem hits you over the head. CAST Rachel McAdams Channing Tatum Scott Speedman LENGTH 144 You know something bad is about to happen. In the first few minutes of ""The Vow"" as happy couple Paige and Leo (Rachel McAdams Channing Tatum) exit a theater and see a fresh coat of snow and go through the motions of digging out their car then pulling out onto the road you dont need to see the headlights bearing down on them -- though you will -- to know this drive wont end well. And you certainly dont need to hear the voice-over -- Tatum speaking in solemn tones about lifes unexpected ""moments"" yadda yadda. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? That voice-over -- which pops up (annoyingly) throughout the story -- may be the biggest complaint about this romantic charmer directed by Michael Sucsy. It waters down a story with a rather spicy premise -- what do you do if your partner survives a car crash but wakes up with no memory of the last five years? Or . . . you? Based on a true story ""The Vow"" follows Paige and Leo as they struggle to get to know each other again despite her uptight parents (Jessica Lange Sam Neill) and Jeremy (Scott Speedman) Paiges slick ex-fiance whom she does recall -- lovingly -- with no memory of why they split. Tatum is unusually expressive; Speedman both hiss-worthy and sympathetic. But McAdams is the real draw. Exuding her usual uncanny warmth on-screen she uses that magnetism to fine effect here. You keep rooting for her even when Paige gets well . . . annoying distancing herself from Leo whom you know shes meant to be with. EntertainmentTrailer The Vow Or is she? Sucsy (whose first feature film ""Grey Gardens"" depicted the complex relationship of Long Islands own wacky Beales) poses challenging questions about the inevitability of love and whether wed really make the same choices again if life handed us a do-over. If only hed nix the sappy oh-so-earnest voice-over. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT A young husband must find a way to woo his wife all over again after a car accident leaves her with amnesia.

"The Vow review A film to forget |       NJ.com comments The Vow review A film to forget Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 10 2012 at 707 AM View/Post Comments Vow ProductionsChanning Tatum and Rachel McAdams play a married couple dealing with an unexpected challenge in aThe Vow.a Every year millions of people stand up and pledge ""For better or for worse for richer or poorer in sickness and in health until death do us part."" About half of them will go on to break that promise. Not Leo. He is the hero of ""The Vow"" and although he didnt make his pledge in those words -- hes far too creative for that -- he did swear to always stand by his new wife Paige. So when a car accident puts Paige in a coma hes there sleeping by her side until she wakes up. But then she does wake up with amnesia. And she doesnt remember him at all. So -- now what? Well what happens is Leo just sort of waits around patiently being supportive. Even when Paige makes him sleep on the couch. Even when her snobby parents -- whom she used to be estranged from and hes never met -- show up and whisk her away. Even when her ex-fiance appears -- and an intrigued Paige welcomes him back into her life. Perfect Leo isnt so much a character as a feminine daydream. Which is okay in a female-oriented movie. Most of the women in male-oriented movies would have to go through two or three rewrites to even rise to the level of daydreams. But the rest of the movie is at best just as vague. And at worst? Well at one point our lovely couple is driving along when the heroine accuses our hero of passing gas. He reluctantly admits to it. At which point she rolls up her window to show her unconditional acceptance or something which he proclaims an extraordinarily ""romantic"" gesture. You know myself I think Ill stick to roses. As for the cast Rachel McAdams is spirited and lovely -- she should have been a big star several times over several years ago -- but she cant do much with this character. (Not only does the amnesia return her to who she was before she met Leo who she was before she met Leo seems like a completely different person.) And as Leo -- well as usual Channing Tatum looks sweet and dull and in most scenes slightly confused. Perhaps hes trying to remember where he left his shirt as -- in another nod to daydreams -- he appears bare-chested as often as possible. Director Michael Sucsy meanwhile is competent but seems to think hes making a beer commercial. The film is attractive enough but looks a little like an old ad for Michelob with jingle-jangle music hipsters in hats and lots of cool Chicago apartments no one can afford. If thats all you want for your Valentines Day treat -- well that and Channing Tatum wandering around in low-slung pajama bottoms -- then get ready to call up your girlfriends and go. Its not as if there are a lot of other movie romances out there right now. But if youre meeting the gals for a night out with nachos and margaritas? Be sure to have them before the film. The tequila may help. Oh and on the drive over? Feel free to keep the windows rolled down. Ratings note The film contains brief nudity and violence. The Vow (PG-13) Screen Gems (114 min.) Directed by Michael Sucsy. With Rachel McAdams Channing Tatum. Now playing in New Jersey.

Review Fans hoping to wallow in the same high-class romantic mush as ""The Notebook"" will find themselves stuck in deeper dopier muck The strong stench from ""The Vow"" is likely to overwhelm the smell of popcorn in movie theaters this weekend. This stinker of a romantic drama is ""inspired by"" -- those coverall weasel words so beloved by studio legal departments -- the true story of Kim and Krickett Carpenter. Shortly after marrying the couple was in a car accident in 1993. Krickett suffered a major brain injury that wiped out permanently her memory of Kim and their life together. He had to woo and win her all over again. Fans hoping to wallow again in the same high-class romantic mush they so eagerly embraced in ""2004s"" popular ""The Notebook"" which also starred Rachel McAdams (opposite Ryan Gosling) are going to find themselves in stuck in far deeper dopier muck here. In ""The Vow"" the Carpenters are rechristened as Paige (McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) but the bare outline of their story remains the same (and we see a photo of the real Carpenters at the end of the film). What the movie does and this is where it starts getting odiferous is ham-handedly add a back-story and various pesky obstacles to keep the two from reuniting quickly. Also read Journey 2 Where Else Are You Going to See Michael Caine Riding a Giant Bumblebee? Paige was a free-spirited artist when she and Leo meet and fall in love in Chicago. But upon awakening from her coma she thinks that her husband seemingly a stranger now sitting at her bedside is one of her doctors. She has reverted to an earlier pre-marriage version of herself-one Leo never knew-whos a suburban socialite-in-training complete with wealthy over-protective bourgeoisie parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange). Paige and Leo apparently now have nothing in common and oh look theres that oleaginous former fiance of hers (Scott Speedman) lurking eagerly in the background. All of this plays out ploddingly made worse by dialogue so wooden (""How do you look at the girl you love and tell yourself its time to walk away?"") it practically clunks like blocks thudding against each. The movies idea of wit during their courtship the couple hang out at coffee shop called Cafe Mnemonic-nudge nudge get it? Theres little the cast can do but carry on as if all of this was meaningful. Tatum whose essential galootishness makes him the modern day reincarnation of Aldo Ray (and the polar opposite of Ryan Gosling) lumbers through doing his awkward best to play a sensitive lug. McAdams an actress who cant help but be radiant hits all the right notes but theres an essential uneasy girlishness to the performance that rings irritatingly false. In fairness I should note that several young women seated near me at a screening gasped at every plot revelation -- apparently they hadnt seen it coming from a mile away -- and expressed audible delight every single time and there are several that the muscular Tatum stripped down to his skivvies or less.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 10 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Feb. 09 2012 256PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English While The Vow will give heart palpitations to fans of its charming co-stars Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum this amnesia-themed romance is the kind of featherweight fare that is enjoyed in the moment and forgotten soon after the end credits roll. Director Michael Sucsy (the Emmy-winning 2009 TV movie Grey Gardens) works with cinematographer Rogier Stoffers and production designer Kalina Ivanov to bring a sumptuous visual style to the Chicago-set story - which was also filmed on location in the perfect Windy City stand-in Toronto. From the bohemian Cafe Mnemonic - the aptly named spot where Leo (Tatum) and Paige (McAdams) have their first date - to the funky converted warehouse spaces where the artsy couple live and work The Vow gives us a steady supply of detailed and gorgeous settings. But the films ""McNugget"" structure offers very little character or plot depth to cling to in the dark. In the sparse opening voice-over Leo describes a love relationship - or more specifically the memory of it - as ""moments of impact."" And indeed the film starts with a big one. In dramatic slo-mo Paige (who has just removed her seatbelt) flies head-first through the windshield of their car after its hit by a large truck one snowy evening. As Paige lies in an induced coma to let her brain heal Leo takes us back four years ago to their first moment of impact (they meet at the city parking authority) followed by what amounts to the ""greatest hits"" of their courtship and marriage - first date first fart in the car getting married in the Art Institute without a permit etc. etc. These scenes function more like a fun upbeat love montage as opposed to creating a portrait of a emotional bond that deserves to last. When Paige awakes in the hospital she thinks Leo is her doctor. Memories of her life with him and of her career as a visual artist are completely gone. This is good news for her conservative suburban parents (Jessica Lange and Sam Neill) from whom shes been estranged for several years - much to her surprise. Paige tentatively agrees to go home with Leo and thus follows another series of little scenes engineered for comic effect. Leo barely recognizes this ""sweater-set wearing mojito-sipping"" woman. She seems to have time-travelled back to approximately a year before she met him when she was engaged to Jeremy (Scott Speedman) and enrolled at law school. But Leo believes the real Paige is still in there. With no hope of Paige regaining those lost years Leo must try to make his wife fall in love with him all over again. Not as easy the second time. The Vow which is driven by the appealingly earnest performances of McAdams and Tatum is inspired by the real-life story of Krickitt Carpenter who wrote a book about her experience. But her story is really just a jumping off point for the screenplay - for starters the Carpenters live in New Mexico and their Christian faith is a major part of their story. Revealing the real-life connection just before the end credits does not suddenly transform The Vow into something beyond a mildly pleasing February diversion. If youre looking for a profound romantic story for Valentines Day I suggest Random Harvest the 1942 MGM classic with Ronald Colman as a First World War amnesia victim who falls in love with Greer Garson and then after an accident returns to his upper-class life in Liverpool forgetting all about his old sweetheart. Ah folks they just dont make amnesia romances like they used to.

Photo Screen Gems/Courtesy Everett Co Leo (Channing Tatum) with the dorky straw fedora he first wore when he met Paige (Rachel McAdams) in the pleasing romance ""The Vow."" Its billed as a romance -- but for hipster guys ""The Vow"" may come off as a horror movie. What could be more nightmarish than marrying a sexy free-spirited sculptor who gets a brain injury and wakes up from her coma as ""a sweater-set-wearing mojito-drinking sorority girl""? The bonk-on-the-head amnesia plot is a cobwebby one but in this case its based on a true story -- of much more ordinary-looking folks than Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams. These two stars bring believable chemistry and emotion to a film that might otherwise wilt under the weight of so much melodrama -- similar to what McAdams did with Ryan Gosling in the weepie ""The Notebook."" We meet music producer Leo (Tatum) and artist Paige (McAdams) as they leave Chicagos Music Box movie theater on a snowy night. As the happy couple stops their car at an intersection to make out theyre rear-ended by a truck. Paige goes through the windshield. Flash back four years to love at first sight in their local DMV. How charming is Leo? Enough to pick up Paige in the worlds least romantic locale wearing a dorky straw fedora. Director Michael Sucsy deploys Tatum perfectly A former stripper in real life his meathead looks cloak a stealth sensitivity. You always sort of expect him to be monosyllabic and yet hes surprisingly good with big words. Soon theyre exchanging hasty but heartfelt vows in an illicit wedding in an art museum -- a memory Leo recalls while sitting at Paiges hospital bedside. When she wakes up she thinks hes her doctor. Not a good sign. He must explain who he is and then who she is a successful sculptor whos just gotten a big commission from the city. Her response ""What about my law degree?"" Five years of Paiges memory are gone leaving her pre-Leo and pre-art school back when she was engaged to a business-suited stiff named Jeremy (Scott Speedman looking whittled-down from his ""Felicity"" days). Post-accident Paige is comically un-artsy She puts trashy highlights in her hair She reads James Patterson She hangs out with her bitchy high school friends Leo is justly confused but determined to win her back. Even the new less-literary her. Now a stranger he must wrest his amnesiac bride from the clutches of her domineering parents (Jessica Lange and Sam Neill so clenched-looking you know theyre hiding something) and somehow convince her to love him all over again. Leo fights dirty One morning in their apartment he strolls into the room naked -- ""habit"" he apologizes sheepishly then grins. He knows an eyeful of Tatum is worth 1000 words. Director Sucsy (""Grey Gardens"") works within the trappings of a typical cheesy romance but finds realism in the details and the banter. You believe this couple had a spark worth fighting for. And thats where the moral of ""The Vow"" will get you if youre feeling even a twinge of Valentines Day sentiment Love is wanting to be with someone even when they revert to an earlier embarrassingly lame self. Sort of the way I fell for this movie -- in spite of all its trashy highlights.

Starring Rachel McAdams Channing Tatum Sam Neill Scott Speedman Jessica Lange Jessica McNamee Dillon Casey Rachel Skarsten Brittney Irvin Director Michael Sucsy Running time 144 Release Opened Feb 10 2012  Editorial Review The Vow True-love tug of warBy Stephanie MerryFriday Feb. 10 2012The romantic drama ""The Vow"" looks like the kind of annual Valentines Day staple that arrives just as calls start flooding flower shops and chocolate bonbon displays invade your local CVS. Not only do stars Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams know their way around tearful breakups and torrential reunions (Two words ""The Notebook"") but the plot also follows the familiar path of true love against all odds. But dont be fooled. This is a war movie - a clash between The Bohemians and The WASPs. Tatum plays Leo who runs a recording studio and is married to sculptor Paige (McAdams). The perfectly matched free spirits take late-night dips in Lake Michigan have tickle fights to relieve stress and host a pop-up wedding at the Art Institute of Chicago much to the chagrin of the museums security staff. They write their vows on takeout menus naturally. But after a car accident sends Paige through a windshield she wakes up a different person. She reverts back to her former humorless self - a person Leo never knew. Her memories from the past five years have been Windexed and replaced by a life in which shes a law student engaged to a buttoned-up suit (Scott Speedman) and devoted to her now estranged parents. As for Leo she assumes hes her doctor. (In her defense his green V-neck T-shirt does look scrub-like.) Thus begins the tug of war. Paiges parents urge her to return home to their Lake Forest mansion while Leo begs her to stay in the city in their record-filled one-bedroom. Given the priggish depiction of Paiges parents the audience is clearly supposed to root for the wood-paneled Wagoneer over the Mercedes-Benz. Forget the filet mignon the screenwriters seem to prescribe. Tofurkey is so much tastier. Its a shame things are so black and white because the movie has more promise - and more laughs - than trailers suggest. Tatum while a bit deficient in the dramatic acting department delivers some memorable quips. He and McAdams also have chemistry. Although Leo and Paiges pre-accident relationship is overly schmoopy (picture spontaneous care packages and secret messages written in blueberries) they create a winning couple. If on the spectrum of likability Leo veers toward perfection Paiges tight-lipped mother (Jessica Lange) and bully of a father (Sam Neill) are rooted at the other end of the line. They live in a nuance-free zone for most of the movie a place where smiles go to die. Insights into these characters are delivered more through the carefully chosen inanimate objects that surround them than words or actions. Paiges mother might as well be a string of pearls; her father could have been played by the couples dining room wallpaper featuring fox-hunting scenes. Similarly the pendulum-like change in Paige tests credulity. When she dons a headband shortly after leaving the hospital it seems intended to be a dark harbinger of Lilly Pulitzer dresses and Vera Bradley bags. But the variance between the pre- and post-accident woman transcends wardrobe; she is different in every way imaginable. Indeed people might opt for a different look or trade in blueberry mojitos for craft brews. But aversions to loud music and tickling seem more deeply ingrained as does ones penchant for joining the no-fun brigade. The movies brightest moments come during Leo and Paiges bright-eyed flirtations as when he amusingly serenades his wife with Meatloafs ""Id Do Anything For Love (But I Wont Do That)."" The sum total of those scenes almost creates a good Valentines Day movie. Just be sure to avert your eyes from the nasty carnage of war.

"Vow The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; vow-the ) Vow The (United States 2012) February 09 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The only reason any male could have for seeing The Vow is the hope of getting laid afterwards. The only reason any female could have for seeing The Vow is if she views the plots of Harlequin romance novels as the height of modern storytelling. This film with its would-be crowd-pleasing contrivances and rote adherence to formula offers almost no redeeming characteristics. From beginning to end it is steeped in artifice without a genuine emotion or interaction to be found. This is for young women what Transformers is for young men. Both are equally offensive to lovers of good cinema. The movie opens with the ultimate cheat of bad films claiming to have been ""inspired by true events."" Whenever a filmmaker feels obliged to pull out the old ""based on a true story"" caption its important to examine the wording. The Vow uses the weakest and most ambiguous phraseology somewhere something vaguely like this kind-of sort-of happened to someone. One could arguably make a similar claim about Clash of the Titans although Im not too sure of the flying mechanical owl. Jurassic Park might be stretching it a bit - get back to me in a few years. As The Vow opens Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) are driving home on the snow-covered streets of Chicago. When they stop at an intersection Paige unwisely removes her seatbelt and hints that a little hanky-panky in the car might result in a pregnancy. Thats when theyre rear-ended (no pun intended) by a truck. Both end up in the hospital - Leo in a neck brace and Paige suffering from a traumatic brain injury. She eventually recovers but has lost five years of memory including all her experiences with her husband. Luckily Mom (Jessica Lange) and Dad (Sam Neill) are on hand to provide succor - and she remembers them although not the reason they havent previously met Leo. Rather than seeing his wifes amnesia as a ""get out of jail free"" card to start a new life Leo decides to hang around and fight for her. The 1 rule of romances whether theyre comedies or dramas or something in between is that the audience must fall for the characters as hard as they fall for each other. Filmmakers who succeed in making that happen can top off their stories with all manner of cheese without fear of losing the viewers. Unfortunately director Michael Sucsy making his feature debut doesnt exhibit that quality. Despite an extended flashback intended to invest us in Paige and Leos relationship I never saw these two as anything more than actors reciting (bad) dialogue while trying desperately to convince us they feel something for one another. The distance between them is palpable. Making things worse although there is no evidence of a spark between Tatum and McAdams theres evidence of genuine chemistry between Tatum and the actress playing his assistant (Tatiana Maslany) - enough in fact that we wish Leo would forget about Paige and turn his attention to the woman who keeps his business afloat while he woos back his wife. Once in a while The Vow strays frustratingly close to the single truly intriguing idea evident in the premise the relationship between identity and memory. However perhaps concerned that an incursion into anything substantive might be too deep for the target audience the filmmakers stay shallow. Critics are expected to review the movie they get not the one they might wish for which is fair. Keeping that in mind I can assert that The Vow is a juvenile and unsatisfying jumble of romantic clichA(c)s and contrivances that marches forward in a wearily predictable pattern. You know the ending before you see the beginning. You know the ending just by looking at the poster. You know the ending just by hearing that Rachel McAdams is in it. McAdams has become typecast the way Meg Ryan was typecast in the late 1980s and early 1990s. However where Ryan was the Romantic Comedy Queen McAdams has become synonymous with Movies That Could Have Been Written By Nicholas Sparks. (Based on the credits of The Vow Sparks was not involved.) Channing Tatum is a likeable sort but he was obviously chosen more based on looks and physique than on his acting ability. And he does Taylor Lautner one better - not only does he show off his bare chest but he provides the camera with an uncensored view of his buttocks. The PG-13 rating prevents him from pulling a Michael Fassbender. What a shame. The supporting cast includes veteran actors Sam Neill and Jessica Lange. This may represent a career nadir for both of them and yes I remember that Lange made her debut in King Kong. Consider what it means when I state that her performance opposite a giant ape was superior to her efforts here. Neill has also played opposite oversized creatures although in neither of his Jurassic Park adventures did he have to wrestle with the kind of dialogue hes forced to utter during The Vow. Watching Neill in this movie I felt the same surge of sympathetic embarrassment I suffered while watching Laurence Olivier in The Betsy. Movies like The Vow give me indigestion. They are hard to swallow and harder still to keep down without medication. The lack of chemistry between the leads and the artificiality of the screenplay preclude engagement with anything happening on screen. Those who like romances because of the surety of a happy ending and the attractiveness of the leads may find something salvageable in The Vow which is probably no worse than much of the tripe targeted at Valentines Day crowds. For a motion picture supposedly about the triumph of true love this is a heartless soulless product.

Its generally intended to convey a state of heightened emotions without going entirely over the top as the romantically linked struggle to triumph against steep odds. Melodrama requires a delicate touch; in the hands of a Sirk or a Spielberg it can be a thing of beauty but more often than not the material drifts toward soap opera and yet still turns a handsome profit. As such The Vow is custom-made to be no exception to the rule. After a swoon-worthy night at the movies Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) take off onto the snowy streets of Chicago only to be rear-ended by a truck. Paige falls into a coma and Leo dutifully waits by her side but when she wakes up she doesnt remember her husband or their friends nor can she recall why she dumped fiance Jeremy (Scott Speedman) or what made her so estranged from her parents (an equally sneering Sam Neill and Jessica Lange). Amid the early histrionics we see them meet cute four years earlier; we see them bond over their respective artistic interests (shes a sculptor hes into music); we see the young lovers get married in an art museum surrounded by their laughably bohemian buddies. (Seriously did they fall out of a Gen-X rom-com and into this film instead?) But its all a wash for Leo who has to win Paige back as she gravitates towards those she still recognizes and trusts. Many questions and apologies ensue akin to a Nicholas Sparks movie somehow not based on a Nicholas Sparks novel or 50 First Dates stripped of its awful jokes leaving only corny gestures and sporadically convincing heartache intact. Taking its basis from the true-life story of New Mexicos Kim and Krickitt Carpenter who were forced to start from scratch after a similar accident had identical repercussions its as if the veritable roundtable of (credited) writers - half of whom are responsible for the treacly likes of prior February lay-ups Valentines Day and Hes Just Not That Into You - dared one another to take their pass at making this true-life struggle increasingly dramatic and thus more unbelievable ""So shes forgotten him..."" ""...and shes back to loving her ex-fiance..."" ""...and her familys also hiding a secret from her"" The plot points pile up like so much car debris. In the true spirit of misshapen melodrama the woes of the central characters stem from exaggerated circumstances rather than realistic situations. As for the stars Tatum defies his wooden reputation here - earnest for a change viably compassionate and determined throughout. Oddly enough McAdams is conversely relegated to his angsty-and-slightly-lost expression though strictly because the plot dictates that her mood swings and overall resistance to the familiar serve as a front-and-center hurdle. Ideally the focus would have been from her disoriented perspective and not his mopey standpoint spare us of his narration all about ""moments of impact"" in a film that has little genuine impact to call its own. (It doesnt help matters that every last character trait that Leo cherishes about Paige seems to have come about strictly during her lost years causing her to revert into a WASP-y drone with dreams of law school and old money living.) The occasional touch of tenderness slips through when the couple isnt bonding over chocolates with Gump-like enthusiasm at their favorite spot Cafe Mnemonic (ugh). But for the most part first-time feature director Michael Suscy sticks to the Hollywood routine of unlikely conflicts and maudlin displays of devotion more than willing to comfort anyone with a fuzzy grasp on real-world romance that the pretty people will make it through somehow with no scars too deep.

"The Vow (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Vow (PG-13) Young beautiful in love - and amnesiac. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald2/9/2012 Editor rating 2 First things first If I get in a car accident suffer a traumatic head injury and emerge from a coma to find Channing Tatum telling me that hes my husband Im just going to go with it. Even if I dont recognize him. This is not however the reaction of Paige (Rachel McAdams) in The Vow a romantic drama that tests a young married couple after just such a situation. Paiges reaction is to recoil in horror which puts her at odds with the audience most of which will be female and there willingly and some of which will be male because sometimes you just have to take your girlfriend to a movie she wants to see or shes never going to let you play Call of Duty with your friends. The good news is The Vow is not excruciating; its just a matter of waiting until the couple -- which includes Tatum as good guy Leo -- works out Paiges memory issues. Chicago where the film is set looks gorgeous on film and Tatum (G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra Haywire) who takes a lot of heat from critics for being wooden is actually the saving grace of the movie. His straightforward Leo a man whose happiness has been threatened by a fate he cant control grounds the story; The Vow is ""inspired by true events"" but theres more than a whiff of soap opera here. Take the amnesia for example Paige only remembers her life before she met Leo and Tatum who covered romantic hero ground capably in Dear John must persuade her to love him again. Some of you just got weak in the knees thinking about that swoony set-up but the post-accident Paige is almost too unpleasant to root for. When we first meet her shes a free spirit a sculptor the sort of brash young woman who writes her wedding vows on a menu and gets married surreptitiously in an art museum. After the accident she reverts to an upscale preppy with shallow vapid friends a predatory ex who reeks of money (Scott Speedman) and Lake Forest-dwelling parents (Sam Neill Jessica Lange) whom Leo has never met. Dad and mom want Paige to return to their moneyed fold and her amnesia is the perfect excuse to lure her back. Boy are they going to be mad when they see that hipster tattoo on her back. A current of anti-wealth sentiment runs through The Vow Leo is sincere because he lives in a funky apartment with guitars on the wall cares about real music (not the kind you make on computers) and references Radiohead. Paiges regression to her pre-Leo self is charted through an increasingly expensive conservative wardrobe. You can tell shes turning inauthentic She colors her hair. But The Vow gives us no reason to believe these crazy kids wont overcome their estrangement. Disaster is what makes us human says Leo as he talks a lot in voiceover about impact physical and emotional and its effects on our lives. ""Each of us is the sum total of every moment we have ever experienced"" Leo tells us. Watching The Vow -- forgettable if vaguely pleasant entertainment -- would seem to disprove that theory.

Photo Kerry Hayes Sony Pictures The Vow review In sickness and amnesia 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Vow Romance drama. Starring Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams. Directed by Michael Sucsy. (PG-13. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Arriving for Valentines Day weekend ""The Vow"" is a cinematic box of candy wrapped in bright red cellophane. Like any box of chocolates you have to bite a lot of bad centers to get to the few good ones. Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) are perfectly beautiful sweethearts enjoying perfect marital bliss until a runaway truck sends Paige smashing into a windshield. Paige awakens from a coma to see Leo at her bedside and thinks hes her doctor. The windshield did not so much as blacken Paiges eyes or mar her lovely skin - oh maybe a token scratch - but it erased the last five years of her memory. She cant remember meeting Leo she cant recall leaving law school to become an ever-so-slightly bohemian sculptor and vegetarian and she has completely forgotten a massive falling-out with her overbearing snotty parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange). What she does remember is being engaged to a mildly pallid businessman (Scott Speedman) whom she dumped before meeting Leo (a much cooler music producer). If director Michael Sucsy couldnt wring romantic anxiety and sniffles from that situation he just wouldnt be trying. Even viewers who are an easy touch for romance movies will find this heavy-handed. Unfortunately most of the movie focuses on Leos much less challenging point of view as the hurt and forgotten lover. This includes an absurdly unnecessary narration by Leo filled with gibberish about moments of ""impact."" Eventually the film works its way to what is more intriguing how disorienting and painful it is for Paige to wake up in a completely different personality and world. The movie improves in the last half hour; the secondary characters prove to have more dimensions than expected the serious tone is relieved by some moments of humor mother Lange finally gets a brief meaty scene (and steals the otherwise indifferently acted movie) and the resolution though basically what youll expect proves satisfyingly messier and more believable than anticipated.

"The Vow leaves you wanting more Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-LoveMOVIE REVIEWS Vows promise just cant deliverLove is foggier the second time around for Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum as a married couple who suddenly find themselves marooned on loss-of-memory lane.February 10 2012|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC When a movie calls itself ""The Vow"" you know it takes its love and its relationships seriously. And thats certainly the case with the new romantically and medically challenged weepie starring Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum.Despite the sweet story -- lovely couple car wreck brain injury she forgets him he loves her anyway -- and the beautiful scenery -- cool converted warehouse spaces snowy Chicago streets Lake Michigan in the moonlight and of course Tatum and McAdams -- this is a movie that leaves you wanting more. To care more to cry more to love more.Inspired by a true story it begins with a date night at the movies for young marrieds Paige (McAdams) and Leo (Tatum). Then an accident on the way home capped by a trip to the emergency room that feels like a pale version of ""Greys Anatomy"" changes everything. When Paige wakes up from a medically induced coma her memory has been wiped clean and thus starts Leos bid to help her remember their life and their love and when she doesnt he tries to get her to fall for him again.Because this is very much a before-and-after affair the film expends a lot of effort shifting between the eras filling in the blanks for us as well as Paige in ways that are sometimes artful and sometime so forced its easy to relate to Paiges increasing impatience. Leo never wavers from long-suffering heroic hunk with his voice-over memories used to stitch everything together and patch over the rough spots in the plot as well. For The Record Los Angeles Times Sunday February 12 2012 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 News Desk 1 inches; 46 words Type of Material Correction ""The Vow"" A review of ""The Vow"" in the Feb. 10 Calendar section said that the screenplay credit was split four ways to include Jason Katims Abby Kohn Marc Silverstein and the films director Michael Sucsy. Sucsy does not have a writing credit on the movie.Lange is welcomeDirector Michael Sucsy who brought out all the crazy cobwebs of TVs ""Grey Gardens"" in such an elegant way hasnt got it all wrong. Hes made a good choice in bringing along one of its leads Jessica Lange. She plays Paiges mother and gives the film one of the few moments that feels absolutely real.To help keep things straight there is a distinct visual line drawn between the two times in Paiges life. Far more appealing is the urban-artiste world that Leo and Paige created as a couple -- shes a sculptor he owns a recording studio -- with all of their spaces retro-riffic. In contrast the suburban affluence of mom (Lange) and dad (Sam Neill much better in ""Alcatraz"" at the moment than this) looks pristine well put together and exceedingly bland.Cinematographer Rogier Stoffers and the production design team headed by Kalina Ivanov outdo themselves to make things visually enticing.The problems start with a very lopsided script that keeps the synapse-crossed lovers too unbalanced too much of the time. With the screenplay credit split four ways to include the director Jason Katims Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein you feel their separate sensibilities fighting for control.It all might have been better left in Katims hands. Having written some of the most believably human relationship dramas on TV including ""My So-Called Life"" ""Friday Night Lights"" and the wonderful complications of the current ""Parenthood"" he might have been able to pull this off.Kohn and Silverstein on the other hand have teamed for a string of unsatisfying lite romantic comedies including ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" and last years ""Valentines Day"" mush.""The Vow"" definitely favors Leo with Tatum given much more to work with. Its nice to see the actor dig deeper than he did in 2010s ""Dear John"" which didnt ask much more of his soldier-on-leave than he look good in board shorts.He can emoteNot that the filmmakers here dont make the most of his bod (as did ""Saturday Night Live"" last week playing the ""I started out as a male stripper"" card heavily). But the filmmakers also let him try out actual emotions which he handles in ways that suggest he could do even more.McAdams is left to do what she can with Paiges elusive memory which calls for a lot of smiles and blank stares though she echoes enough of the sweetness of ""The Notebook"" to probably satisfy those fans. But it feels like such wasted spaciness.She is such an appealing actress that its hard not to wish someone could make better use of the kind of smart vulnerable edge she brought to ""The Family Stone"" or her wits-matching sass opposite Robert Downey Jr. in ""Sherlock Holmes.""Sadly Paiges memory isnt the only thing gone missing in ""The Vow."" There are close-up kisses to be sure a nice shot of naked bodies in tangled sheets a nearly naked dip in the lake a wedding video filled with lots of hints at bliss but no heart-racing pulse-pounding passion to speak of.There is a flicker in one of the after-the-wreck moments with Paige and Leo working their way through a box of chocolates trying to recapture the emotions of their first date.If only the filmmakers had found a way to fan that flame.--betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--The VowMPAA rating PG-13 for an accident scene sexual content partial nudity and some languageRunning time 1 hour 29 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESAct of Valor triumphs at box officeFebruary 27 2012Quick Takes Vow tops Valentines box officeFebruary 16 2012The Vow a hit after marketers say I do to Twitter...February 14 2012Movie Projector The Vow to sweep audiences off their feetFebruary 10 2012Hollywood finds romance in travelFebruary 5 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTLoveLeoChanning TatumBrain InjuryCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-the-vow-20120210,0,4999213.story",200,thevow14,thevow,latimes

They marry in a hastily arranged service in Chicagos Art Institute apparently without official sanction. But thats how this cute slightly rebellious couple rolls. They also take dips in icy Lake Michigan in their underwear and eat waffles and chocolate truffles for dinner. In other words theyre Hollywood-quirky.One night while driving in a snowstorm they lean over to kiss and are hit by a truck. Paige is thrown through the windshield and Leo sustains minor injuries.About the movieThe Vow out of fourStars Rachel McAdams Channing Tatum Sam Neill Jessica Lange DirectorMichael SucsyDistributor Sony Pictures Rating PG-13 for an accident scene partial nudity sexual content and some language Running time 1 hour 44 minutes Opens today nationwideWhen Paige regains consciousness -- her thick curly hair and unblemished face intact -- she has no memory of Leo or their life together. Her parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) swoop in to rescue their daughter though they had been estranged from Paige prior to the accident. Theyd never met Leo and are inexplicably determined to wrest their twentysomething daughter from his loving clutches. But these are caricatures of controlling wealthy people and Leo is just the slightest bit boho which to them translates into threatening.Meanwhile Paige reverts to an earlier Stepford-like persona. She dons bland preppy outfits instead of her cool vintage clothing and is shocked when she sees a small tattoo on her back. Her amnesia may have erased five years of her life but its hard to buy how she re-invented herself so thoroughly from straitlaced country-club girl to a free-spirited sculptor in the first place.Leo decides he must woo his wife all over again banking on the hope that shell revert to the arty Paige with whom he fell in love. But their romance is slightly more complicated the second time around. An old fiancee re-appears and family secrets are spilled. Still theres never any doubt whether love will conquer all in this predictable wannabe heart-warmer.Paige and Leos tale is based on the true story of Kim and Krickitt Carpenter. Married in 1993 they were in a car accident 10 weeks later from which Krickitt awoke with no recollection of Kim. They married again in 1996 and wrote a book about their saga also entitled The Vow.When it comes to romances in which an accident figures prominently in the plot 1995s While You were Sleeping did it better. It featured more likable characters heartier wit and more romantic chemistry.For all of Leos voice-over musing about ""moments of impact"" that change lives The Vow makes little cinematic impact and will leave all but the most starry-eyed unmoved.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet If youre going to make an unapologetically cheesy romantic melodrama why not cast Channing Tatum as the male lead? A former model dancer and stripper before he transitioned into acting Tatum has the good looks and cut-granite physique of the sort of men encountered most often in daydreams and the puppy-dog earnestness of a boyfriend who secretly worries he isnt worth your time. The looks come from nature. The latter quality comes from Tatums acting which always seems to be striving not to disappoint. He may not be a natural actor but hes trying so hard its kind of winning. Thats true even in a film that does him no favors like The Vow which casts him as a hopeless romantic whose courtship techniques include spelling out romantic messages with blueberries and giving a new girlfriend a picture of himself strumming a guitar. (Plausible.) His character is also a brilliant music producer who surrounds himself with eccentric porkpie-hat-wearing hipster friends (less plausible) and who narrates the movie in a lyrical voiceover that philosophizes about that nature of love memory and fate. (Ummm...) Still that voiceover is just one silly element in a film that isnt afraid to pile silliness upon silliness in telling the loosely fact-inspired story of a young couple (Tatum and Rachel McAdams) whose marriage is forced into crisis when a car accident leaves her unable to remember anything about her recent life including falling in love and marrying Tatum. (All this in spite of the blueberries.) Whats more she remembers being a drastically different person. A sculptor trained at Chicagos School Of The Art Institute the pre-trauma McAdams fits right into Tatums bohemian milieu but the accident has reverted her to who she was before embarking on a career in art a law student who lives for the approval of her conservative parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) and is still in love with a slimy ex-fiance (Scott Speedman). As for Tatum he seems nice enough but hes not really her type. Cue this line from Tatum setting up the premise of the film ""I need to make my wife fall in love with me again."" For a while Tatum McAdams and director Michael Sucsy make the most of that sweet dumb premise as Tatum tries to win back the woman living under his own roof while she starts discarding her funky clothing to don polo shirts and drifting from the photogenically gritty city to Chicagos moneyed northern suburbs. Everyone plays it straight without taking themselves too seriously. Hes troubled but earnest. Shes confused but appealingly upbeat. Much of the action transpires against lovingly photographed Chicago landmarks. Its unashamedly escapist but a turn for the serious as The Vow nears the finish line only underscores its essential silliness and what a poor job the film has done making it seem like its characters need each other for reasons beyond looking good together. Their love seems based less on fate or brain chemistry than the requirements of formula.

A couple must fall in love all over again. Rachel McAdams is the best thing in a pleasurable rom-com.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune February 9 2012 -- 353pm Screem Gems Star Tribune Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams star in ""The Vow."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint What a difference five years can make. For Paige (Rachel McAdams) it meant a new life free from her rich controlling parents free-spirited new friends a loving marriage to Leo (Channing Tatum) and a promising career as a sculptor. Then she loses her memory after a car crash and without those experiences who is she? In ""The Vow"" Paige tries to piece together her life as characters from her recent and former lives try to pull her back into their orbit. For Leo whos both devoted and supportive of whatever path Paige needs to follow on her recovery the situation is clear ""Ive got to make my wife fall in love with me again."" For Paige who feels freed to move in whichever direction she chooses the way forward is less clear-cut ""I feel like Ive got a do-over on my life."" So will it be a return to sweater sets law school and her conniving former fiance (Scott Speedman) or rediscovering why she fell for the sensitive but far from successful Leo? Nicholas Sparks meet Philip K. Dick. The best thing in the film is McAdams who moves through her post-amnesia scenes with a plausible mix of good humor and wariness. Her character retains our sympathy even when shes making other peoples lives difficult and you can see why Tatums Leo clings to her for dear life. Hes well cast as a burly lug who married far above his station. Despite that ""nobodys home"" air of his he projects an uncomplicated decency and you feel for him when McAdams disapproving parents (the underutilized Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) show him no love. Despite its gimmicky premise ""The Vow"" never teeters over into burlesque. While it wont make you fall out of your chair it is proficient Valentines Day entertainment. Michael Sucsy (of HBOs warmly remembered ""Grey Gardens"") directs with a light touch. The script loosely based on a true story has a fair share of surprises (and several of the cleverest pickup lines in ages). Despite too many on-the-nose moments (Paige and Leos date spot is named Cafe Mnemonic) the screenplay is knowing about the small domestic details that serve as glue or irritants in ongoing relationships. At breakfast with Leo Paige gobbles a bacon strip before he can remind her that shes vegetarian. The old Paige loved being tickled; the new one hates it. The film is aware that for two human beings to be in an emotional and sexual relationship without causing pain to each other demands constant vigilance; in real life the anything-goes spontaneity that propels romantic comedy would wear thin fast. In less skillful hands ""The Vow"" would be a guilty pleasure. Instead its just a pleasure. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

More about The Vow >> Theres no close-up of the marquee or of the posters on the street to indicate what theyve just seen but here are some suggestions Memento Regarding Henry Random Harvest I Love You Again any of the Bournes. Yes The Vow is an amnesia movie a slathered-with-sentiment romance in which the perky Paige goes flying through a car window and awakens from her coma (lots of intercranial hemorrhaging) unable to recognize the man she adored. Theres Leo at the foot of the hospital bed his mouth agape His wife opens her eyes peers uncertainly in his direction and addresses him as ""Doctor."" And so in the impossibly corny The Vow (impossibly corny yes but ""inspired by true events"") Leo has to woo Paige all over again. She doesnt remember the loft they shared or their coffee-making morning ritual. She doesnt remember her art studio or the sculpture shes been commissioned to make. Or the fact that shes a vegetarian and has a tattoo on her back (no its not a dragon). The bigger problem is that the spark between Paige and Leo doesnt seem to be there anymore. (Speaking of sparks both McAdams and Tatum are veterans of similar mush adapted from Nicholas Sparks best sellers She The Notebook. He Dear John.) Paige returns home to her uptight upmarket parents (Sam Neill Jessica Lange) puts unflattering highlights in her hair finds her old preppy clothes and reengages with her pre-Leo beau (Scott Speedman). Shes stuck in ""old me"" mode - theres a patch of near-parodic dialogue in which Paige rambles on about ""the old me"" and ""the new me."" There wasnt an artsy bone in her body back then. She was enrolled in law school. She was Daddys little girl. But Leo who runs a recording studio is not giving up. ""Ive got to make my wife fall in love with me again"" he tells his coterie of chums a genial gang of homogenized hipsters as they shuffle down the street. He takes her back to the wine-and-chocolate spot that was the site of their first date. (Cafe Mnemonic its called - they wrote their wedding vows on its take-out menus.) He drives her to the secluded swatch of lakefront where they used to go skinny-dipping. And he cries man tears. McAdams and Tatum arent exactly thespian heavyweights but even if they were there isnt much they can do with this hokey melodrama beyond playing it straight playing it sincere. It turns out theres a dark secret lurking in Paiges traumatized psyche and its third-act revelation upends ""the full do-over"" Paige feels like shes been granted in life. Ready-made for Valentines Day The Vow is like the offerings at Cafe Mnemonic a total sugar overload. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

The Vow is the rare chick flick thats about brain trauma in addition to being a cause of it. Its what you might get if the eminent neurologist-author Oliver Sacks tried his hand at a True Romance comic and as such its quite watchable date-night cheese - the kind of movie you can simultaneously snort at and enjoy.And it has Channing Tatum who has always seemed like one of those human-shaped wooden building blocks that somehow became a real boy. He co-stars with Rachel McAdams attended by her dimples and the two play Leo and Paige Two pretty people in love. Thats always been one of the fundamental attractions of the movies - that and the melodramatic curveballs we await with sadistic anticipation.Here that curveball is amnesia. Oh my yes. The blissfully married couple are rear-ended by a truck one snowy Chicago evening and when Paige awakes from her coma she has no idea that Leo is her true soul mate. Hes just some guy who looks like a building block.Director Michael Sucsy and a small army of writers have a decent amount of fun with this set-up. For one thing Paige cant remember anything past her immediate post-college years before she became a hip downtown sculptress. When she was to put it kindly a ding-a-ling. So she highlights her hair dresses in Talbots remainders and starts ordering blueberry mojitos. Run Leo runBut Leos a stand-up sort and for an actor who appears to have two and a half facial expressions Tatum wrings our sympathies with ease. Im sure he knows his lines are italicized porridge (""How do you look at the girl you love and tell yourself its time to walk away?) but he delivers them as if they had just occurred to him and he neither sucks up to the genre nor looks down on it. Its an honest performance and an effective one.McAdams gets the showy stuff playing with the shopping mall metaphysics of the plot. What would you do if your last five years were erased? Who would you be? As far as Paige knows shes still in love with a slick lawyer (Scott Speedman acting with his hair gel). Shes still in law school; shes still a daddys girl daddy being a frosty suburban attorney played by Sam Neill. Paiges mother by the way is played by Jessica Lange and if you think thats a career downgrade wait for the short monologue where she wipes the floor with every other actor in the film. (Memo to the people near me who were audibly shocked by Langes appearance Its called aging and it happens to a lot of people outside of Hollywood. In this case very gracefully.)Many of the expected cliches are avoided No second bonk to reset Paiges hard drive no climactic slow-motion swoons. But the filmmakers arent sure what to put in their place and the story drifts sweetly to a halt. By the end ""The Vow has created its own amnesiac force-field. You may come out of the theater with a vague but genuine sense of pleasure and an hour later remember nothing about the movie at all.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

The Vow Bad to fair Director Michael Sucsy. Starring Rachel McAdams Channing Tatum and Sam Neill. Rated PG-13 for an accident scene sexual content partial nudity and some language. This weeks new movie releases That wouldnt suck right? Nevertheless she must reject this foreign existence in her confused state because the plot of ""The Vow"" requires some conflict. This old-fashioned amnesia tale would seem totally implausible and manufactured for maximum melodrama; as it turns out director Michael Sucsys film is indeed based on a true story. But it might have been even more compelling with some different casting. McAdams as the perplexed Paige is her usual likable self and Tatum as Leo once again proves hes an actor of greater depth than his hunky good looks might suggest. But what if Paige woke up and found she was married to someone who looked like say Paul Giamatti? That might have offered an intriguing little wrinkle. He loves her fiercely and madly and deeply and all those intense proclamations meant to make the teen girls in the audience swoon. Hes willing to fight for her to help her retrace how they met and what their life together was like in hopes of jogging her memory. Hes even prepared to withstand the condescension and disapproval of her wealthy parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) who wanted her to become a lawyer and from whom shes been estranged all this time. But he looks like Paul Giamatti. Instead ""The Vow"" serves as a series of precise if obvious moments and emotional cues we must endure en route to the inevitable reconciliation complete with an intrusively heart-tugging score and too much explanatory voiceover from Tatum. This includes flashbacks to Paige and Leos meet-cute at the DMV the chocolates they shared on their first date the wacky eclectic friends and the secret wedding they staged amid the paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago where Paige had been a student. (Leos life by the way isnt nearly so well fleshed-out. His entire purpose seems to be the service of this woman.) Give some credit to screenwriters Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein (""Hes Just Not That Into You"") and Jason Katims They remain faithful to the real-life story and dont magically restore Paiges memories. But the smug parents and the jilted ex-fiance (Scott Speedman) whos all too happy to rekindle their old romance feel more like pat devices than real obstacles to ultimate happiness. (Lange who won an Emmy for starring in Sucsys ""Grey Gardens"" on HBO does have one powerful moment of truth that helps Paige piece together her past.) Its a nice idea experiencing what its like to fall in love all over again for the first time. McAdams and Tatum sometimes make the execution of it more tolerable than it should be but not often enough. ""The Vow"" a Sony Screen Gems release is rated PG-13 for an accident scene sexual content partial nudity and some language. Running time 89 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.

(Kerry Hayes ) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday February 9 2012 1145 AM Title The Vow Film Info PG-13 Sexuality Partial Nudity Language. At area theaters. How perfect is Channing Tatums dedicated husband in ""The Vow""? He attends fancy wedding events without complaint. He makes sugar-dusted French toast. He gets drenched in the rain to deliver a get-well basket. He does everything a dream guy would do short of standing under a window blasting Peter Gabriel from a boombox. He cant do that of course because this isnt that kind of movie. This is a down-the-middle by-the-numbers fantasy in which no one is too quirky or interesting or challenging in any way. Even the circumstances that set the plot in motion -- loosely based on true events -- are presented as blandly as possible by director Michael Sucsy. After a bad car accident Leo (Tatum) and his wife Paige (Rachel McAdams) wake up in a hospital. Hes fine but Paige has suffered severe brain trauma. She remembers nothing from the last five years including Leo. Her estranged parents (Jessica Lange Sam Neill) swiftly move in to take advantage of this situation as does her slick ex (Scott Speedman who should work more). So Leos left on the sidelines desperately trying to convince his own wife that they belong together. As the worlds most chipper recovering coma patient McAdams is a beautiful blank. Theres not a single moment when her character feels real or as if she genuinely has anything at stake. So its a good thing Tatum steps up to add a little depth to this unabashedly lightweight venture. Judging from his (lack of) wardrobe he was hired primarily to look great in (and out of) boxers. But hes a better actor than people often give him credit for and he invests the heartbroken Leo with a touching sincerity. As a result ""The Vow"" delivers more than it ought to given the pedestrian script and direction. Theres no shortage of viewers ready to embrace an old-fashioned guilty-pleasure romance. If youre among them youll find just enough to sigh over here. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Comments click to enlarge The Vow Video Rated PG-13  104 minutes  2012 Two bland materialistic WASPs (Channing Tatum Rachel McAdams) must rebuild their marriage from scratch after the wife loses her memory in an accident. At least one unfunny comedy (the 1940 William Powell-Myrna Loy vehicle I Love You Again) and one unmoving drama (the 1991 Harrison Ford vehicle Regarding Henry) have been built around the premise of amnesia threatening a marriage. This has more in common with the latter than the former but most of the time it plays like the movie adaptation of a Lands End catalog making monogamy seem essential by associating it with high-end interior design.

When a tragic accident erases all memory of a womans marriage from her mind her husband must work overtime to recreate the spark that caused her to fall in love with him in ""The Vow"" a complaisant date-night bauble designed for romantic indelibility right down to its touching true-story roots. Inspired by the case of Kim and Krickitt Carpenter (upgraded to Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams onscreen) ""The Vow"" reps that most welcome kind of Valentines Day offering focusing on the feelings that bring couples closer -- a recipe for big February B.O. and long-lasting ancillary. Leo (Tatum) cant believe his luck. Somehow he managed to wed a woman Paige (McAdams) he thinks is out of his league. Shes an artist; he runs a small recording studio. Together they live a seemingly perfect boho-chic existence ... until a dump truck plows through the back of their scrappy hatchback sending Paige through the windshield and into a coma that leaves her memory partially wiped. When she comes to in the hospital she remembers everything up to law school thinks shes still in love with former fiance Jeremy (Scott Speedman) and cant wrap her mind around the idea that she ever would have traded in such a seemingly perfect life to marry Leo. As if fate isnt a cruel enough adversary in his efforts to win Paige back he also has to contend with her family and pesky ex. Sam Neill and Jessica Lange play Paiges controlling parents who seize the opportunity of their daughters accident to pave over a catastrophic falling-out five years earlier while Jeremy fetching yet flat takes wicked delight in Paiges inability to remember the reason they broke up. Had the incident -- or some variation of it -- not happened to a real couple auds might chalk it up to the worst possible abuse of Hollywoods favorite lazy-screenwriting tool dramatically expedient amnesia. But ""The Vow"" doesnt play by the rules of other selective-memory-loss movies where jagged flashbacks provide glimpses into the protags mysterious past culminating in a well-timed flood of revelation; Paiges best memories are gone never to return. Hence the pic leans on Leos perspective in this seemingly unthinkable situation -- his driving force to win her back is the strength of all the personal moments the two of them shared bundled into a 15-minute greatest-hits reel at the films outset Their meet-cute at the DMV a thoughtful get-well delivery at the restaurant where she works (Cafe Mnemonic -- get it?) etc. As he struggles to win her back the memories continue to motivate him. Take a step back and its impossible not to notice that these flashbacks all share one thing in common They all feature Leo going above and beyond to make Paige happy. If she werent so darn pretty straight male auds might begin to question whats so special about a woman in such constant need of wooing. Everyone else is encouraged to think he loves nothing more than trying to earn her love garnishing scene after scene of superhuman patience with close-ups of Tatums watery eyes and glimpses of body parts typically reserved exclusively for Paige. Her dilemma would be easier to swallow if Tatum were less swoon-inducing as the poor sod stuck trying to win her back. He compensates somewhat by delivering his lines in a sort of Neanderthal stupor downplaying the cockiness of his previous roles. Even so what teenage girl wouldnt trade her best memories to wake up in a hospital bed married to the studly ""Step Up"" star? Coming off HBOs critically acclaimed ""Grey Gardens"" telepic director Michael Sucsy adapts well to a genre dominated in recent years by Nicholas Sparks adaptations (the casting of McAdams star of Alzheimers weepie ""The Notebook"" can be no coincidence). With its stately crane shots and plaintive score ""The Vow"" feels as unabashedly sentimental as those melodramas but resists the cloying impulse to manufacture tragedy for easy tears. Its also wonderfully specific fabricating details about Leo and Paiges relationship against which girls will judge their suitors for decades to come. Still as ""The Vow"" flirts with the fantasy of a woman torn between two handsome and wholly devoted suitors it feels like an ice-cream shopping spree in which you can have any flavor you want so long as its vanilla. Gone is the suspense of a great love-triangle movie replaced with the ultra-romantic notion that if the heavens really wanted Leo and Paige to be together their chemistry would be strong enough to transcend having to start over.

TWITTER Anyone whos previously been exposed to the work of screenwriters Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein will know what to expect from The Vow. Fans who lapped up the prefab boy-girl inanities of Hes Just Not That Into You Valentines Day and Never Been Kissed will likely fall for it while those who suffered through any of the above would rather do latrine duty during a diarrhea outbreak than be subjected to this their blood relation. Screen Gems slow sincere romantic concoction cannot conceal what it is a commodity manufactured to be sold to a very specific audience for Valentines Day. Women supposedly get to call the shots on what film to see on this holiday and enough will pick this to make it click at the box office. But good luck to the young men who get roped into going. The Vow has the benefit of being based on a true story (a postscript shot reveals -- big surprise -- that the couple in question look nothing like Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum) but its melodramatic premise more than anything resembles soapy tearjerkers of the 30s and 40s in which incredibly extreme predicaments prevented lovers from being together or mothers from holding on to their children. Such heart-tuggers have their appeal to some people in any era but earnest hokum of this nature has become increasingly rare. And for a reason. Still if its cast correctly and directed with a straight face you can fool some of the people some of the time and so it will likely be for this cocktail of contrivance. In the lulling opening scene lovebirds Paige (McAdams) and Leo (Tatum) emerge from the beautiful old Chicago cinema the Music Box on an enchanting snowy night get in their car and are promptly rammed from behind by a truck sending Paige flying through the windshield (in extremely slow motion). PHOTOS Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum Shine at The Vow Premiere Cut to four years earlier and the beginning of the Paige-Leo love story which is cute enough particularly when they marry surreptitiously in a gallery of the Art Institute of Chicago (where shes a student). But back in the present trumped-up conflict arrives at the hospital in the form of Paiges long-absent parents (Sam Neill Jessica Lange) rich old prigs who try to use the excuse of their daughters memory loss of her more recent years -- she hasnt a clue who Leo is -- to pry her away from her husband and bring her back to their Lake Forest nest. The key to the film for dreamy-eyed girls ready willing and anxious to capitulate is that Leo is truly in love with Paige. Reluctantly agreeing to return to their (very expensively appointed) downtown loft to see if a reintroduction to her old routine will begin to jar her memory loose Paige isnt even jolted into recognition by the sight of her hunky husband naked (from the rear as far as the audience is concerned). But Leo perseveres and through all manner of rejection trouble from her parents and a downturn at the recording studio he runs he dedicates himself to the proposition that ""Ive got to make my wife fall in love with me again."" VIDEO The Vow Stars Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams Talk Chemistry Romance In due course he asks her out on a ""first date"" gets her to skinny dip (with underwear) in Lake Michigan and accompanies her back to their old haunt the Cafe Mnemonic (ha-ha). She still cant remember Leo who waits patiently and chastely (but often without his shirt on) through it all even when Paige has no trouble remembering her high school amour Jeremy (Scott Speedman) whom she jilted but who wants to take advantage of the unusual situation to snatch his prize back from Leos grasp. In his big-screen feature debut Michael Sucsy who made his name with the HBO dramatization of Grey Gardens directs with computerlike precision; every composition and cut is made with its calculated effect readily evident. Particularly egregious are the countless music cues for the pale pop songs on each one of which you can feel the button being pushed for the desired emotional effect. Its hard to know how a woman is supposed to behave if she has a several-years memory gap but McAdams makes this one pretty spunky if clueless of what to make of this muscled guy who has nothing but great things to say about her and the times they had together. While limited in range to be sure Tatum is actually OK with what he has to do; he never strains to achieve something hes not able to pull off and he does make you believe hes taken with this young lady to the exclusion of all others; hes good to his vow. Chicago gets to show off in a number of shots particularly in the Grant Park lakefront area but most of the film was shot in Toronto.

The only things Paige can recall are that she was engaged to Jeremy (Scott Speedman) and close to her wealthy parents (Sam Neill and a scene-stealing Jessica Lange). But more has changed in five years than Paige can bear to confront.This raises interesting questions how would you feel if you woke up and found yourself living a life you never expected with a haircut wardrobe and social scene you hated? What if the man youre married to is a stranger? But the script rarely digs deep enough to become a serious meditation on change character and circumstance. Much is seen from the point of view of the husband vowing to win back his wife so distancing this story from its target market (women if you hadnt guessed).Still Tatum is charming and both stars make decent use of the scripts gently humorous potential. As a superficial look at a weird situation its reasonably diverting. But the narrative errs on the side of slowness and emotions are kept at arms length - no sign of the heart-wrenching romance key to McAdamss turn in The Notebook and Channing Tatums in Dear John both based on Nicholas Sparks novels. On the one hand this makes The Vow a more sensible realistic film - but it may leave expectant romantics with hankies to spare.
