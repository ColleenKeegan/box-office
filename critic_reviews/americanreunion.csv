Thirteen years later those characters have grown up - but the movies havent. American Reunion sees Jim (Jason Biggs) Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) and their toddler head home for a high-school reunion party inevitably hooking up with the entire cast of the original movie en route. But what could have been a sweet nostalgic reflection on the pitfalls and pleasures of growing up - with added dick jokes - is let down by a feeble script which eschews good-natured humour in favour of crass innuendo and postcard sauce outside of porn there has never been a movie with so many shots of grown men eyeing teenage girls backsides. The result is fitfully amusing but more often just creepy.

Perhaps more than any film in the last fifteen years it has influenced and led to more films than any other. As such this is why this film was such a disappointment. The very best bits were in the trailer so if you dont see the film you wont have missed much. What was bright and funny in the original is reheated and like a day old pizza it leaves rather a bad taste in your mouth. There is too much reliance on nob gags and not enough genuine humour nor enough time spent on the script.

"American Reunion | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; american-reunion ) American Reunion (United States 2012) April 06 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli American Pie remains a touchstone of 90s comedies in particular and raunchy teen sex comedies in general. Viewed today it has retained an element of its initial breezy freshness although a progression of envelope-pushing comedies have made it easy to forget how daring it was in its day. Its popularity led to two inferior theatrical sequels (American Pie 2 in 2001 and American Wedding in 2003) and four direct-to-video spin-offs. American Reunion seeks to reunite the original cast and give them a new story set 13 years beyond American Pie. For the most part however this fourth installment is recycling familiar material only without the chuckles and guffaws. Helmed by the Harold and Kumar guys Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg American Reunion tries to use nudity sex and fecal matter to generate laughter but the jokes are tired and predictable. This is a joyless experience made all the sadder because most viewers still remember the naughty delights delivered by American Pie. The movie intentionally feeds some of the melancholy. By their nature reunions are bittersweet affairs. It can be fun to catch up and show off lifestyle changes but the more time has passed the more evident it becomes how quickly life slips away. The characters in American Reunion are conscious of this and so are we. There are a couple of genuinely touching scenes in which Jim (Jason Biggs) and his father (Eugene Levy) discuss Jims mothers death. It is however a bad sign when a raunchy comedys best moments are dramatic ones. Pretty much everyone is back in East Great Falls for the 13-year reunion of the Class of 1999 either for a cameo or a larger role. Front and center are Jim and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) who arrive with a two-year old in tow. Oz (Chris Klein) has become a popular TV sports personality; his girlfriend is a hot-but-superficial model Mia (Katrina Bowden). Ozs ex Heather (Mena Suvari) has a surgeon boyfriend (Jay Harrington) but still carries a torch for her high school sweetheart. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols) is happily married to someone who is not his old flame Vicky (Tara Reid). While a hook-up between the two is unlikely they remain friendly. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) tells stories of adventures in far-flung places and finds romance with ugly duckling-turned-swan Selena (Diana Ramirez). And of course theres Stifler (Seann William Scott) whose body is 31 but whose emotional maturity has never surpassed 12. On those rare occasions when the movie is funny its probably because the Stifmeister is involved. There is no plot to speak of. American Reunion is about what happens when teenage friends reconnect in their 30s. And if theres little humor to be found here theres some truth Jim and Michelle experiencing marital woes with a kid around the house Oz dissatisfied with his high-profile lifestyle and Finch afraid of having embraced conventionality. Most of the (female) nudity is provided by Ali Cobrin as the hot girl Jim babysat when she was six. Now shes 18 and is eager to lose her virginity. American Reunion is about bringing couples together. Jim and Michelle rediscover the reasons they married Oz and Heather decide to give things another try Finch and Selena choose to take an adventure together Jims Dad and Stiflers Mom (Jennifer Coolidge) find that even old fogies can have hot sex in a movie theater and even Stifler hooks up with someone in an act of Karmic retribution. With so many moving parts its no wonder American Reunion doesnt have time to tell a bigger story or provide more than the obligatory sex jokes. Hurwitz and Schlossberg treat the American Pie characters in much the same way they have handled Harold amp; Kumar - by ramping up the shock/gross-out elements and de-emphasizing character interaction. The problem with this approach is obvious American Pie worked not just because it took chances and had moments of hilarity but because we cared about the protagonists. Jim and his companions felt more like friends than carbon copy teen comedy cut-outs. In American Reunion they are too often props for failed humor. The directors bring along two actors from the Harold amp; Kumar series - Jon Cho (who has had a supporting role throughout the American Pie series) and Neil Patrick Harris (in a cameo). One wonders if Kal Penn was approached. The biggest draw of American Reunion is the chance to revisit familiar characters after a passage of nine years. Unfortunately the movie doesnt offer much beyond that. If a viewers primary purpose is to satisfy a curiosity about how Jim Michelle Oz Kevin Finch and Stifler have evolved entering their fourth decade of life the answer is here. If its to recapture an experience similar to the one delivered along with these characters in 1999 the time machine is broken. Some things should be left in the past and the American Pie ensemble is among them.

At area theaters. Are we surprised that ""American Reunion"" -- the latest in the surprisingly lasting ""American Pie"" series -- starts with a dual masturbatory scene? Are we surprised young women in bikinis lingerie and much less dominate many of the films familiar shots? Or that Stifler (Seann William Scott) rocks a ""Orgasm Donor"" T-shirt throughout a lengthy scene? Or that the film is rated R for crude and sexual content nudity language drug use and teen drinking? Of course we arent. After multiple sequels we know better because weve watched this gang grow up. The embarrassing viral video. The subgenre-defining antics. The testosterone-driven over-the-top parties. And the more grown-up stuff too like getting married. (Remember ""American Wedding""? Didnt think so.) But as formulaic as ""American Reunion"" is -- and as unchanged as its characters remain -- the movie has more value than ""The Hangover Part II."" You know whats going to happen before you buy your popcorn A high school reunion dotted with mishaps ridiculousness old romances and male bonding. But where the ""Hangover"" sequel lost its heart in Thailand this all-""American"" gang finds its footing in the same houses and high schools of its past. Fans of the franchise will remember that Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are married -- and now they have a 2-year-old and the non-existent sex life that comes along with the tyke. As the pals reconvene for the postponed reunion Oz (Chris Klein) is a sportscaster with newfound stardom via a ""Dancing With the Stars""-like show and Stifler is a grunt at a financial powerhouse. There are other characters -- Tara Reids Vicky Thomas Ian Nicholas Kevin Mena Suvaris Heather Eddie Kaye Thomas Finch -- and theyre all here. But lets take this opportunity to talk about Stifler who remains a modern marvel -- and the only reason this franchise ever lasted beyond the second film. Stifler is awful. Hes obnoxious. Hes a horndog. And hes lovable -- the heart and spirit of the series believe it or not. And Scott is in delightful form here from his condescending fake laughs to his devious asides -- never straying all that far from his frenzied ""Dude Wheres My Car"" persona. Yes ""American Reunion"" is a juvenile outing. They steal jet skis and defecate in beer coolers. They cheat on their girlfriends and lie to their best friends. But what did you expect? There is a cringe-inducing sub-plot of a neighbor kid grown up 18-year-old Kara (Ali Cobrin) who wants to lose her virginity to her former babysitter the now-married Jim. She doesnt care about his wife and kid. She wont tell a soul. And when she gets drunk at a party and snags a ride home with Jim she takes off her dress and remains topless for an uncomfortable stint that has her knocked unconscious dragged around (still topless) like a rag doll and eventually deposited safely in her bed. Its an indelicate uncomfortable scene -- one that (surprisingly) barely involves the series primary offender Stifler. Shame on the writers. Not that we expect good taste from them. But certain parts of that sequence stooped lower than expected. Other than that the writing is what youd expect -- with a couple key romantic turns you might not expect. Its not giving away too much to say that the bedroom scenes between Stiflers Mom (Jennifer Coolidge) and Jims Dad (Eugene Levy) are inspired -- and Stiflers revenge at the end of the film is also a fitting well-played twist.

Like Circuit City or the Rocky Mountain News this teen sex franchise has become a poster child for once-popular brands that havent adapted. The market for film comedy has changed since 1999 but ""American Reunion"" plays like an evolutionary throwback to pre-Apatow times. Though audiences now rightly expect a little heart with their raunch the best this film can do is layer maudlin sentimentality atop stale jokes about tube socks and flutes. Thirteen years on the hormonally tormented teens of the original films are grownups but the films point of view remains relentlessly juvenile. Nine years after their marriage Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are raising a toddler and are too pooped to pound the bedsprings. When he thinks the missus is otherwise engaged he fires up his laptop if you get my meaning and I suspect you do. In a bid to revive their relationship and regain the lost spirit of youth they decide to return home for a class reunion. Its unfortunate for this film that it arrives soon after the release of ""21 Jump Street"" which also features an adults-reliving-high-school premise but is 50 times funnier. Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg the screenwriters of the uproarious ""Harold and Kumar"" movies have misplaced their sense of humor on this outing. The film is third-degree boring. In scenes of autopilot exposition we learn that Oz (Chris Klein) is a sportscaster with a wild-thing girlfriend Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a house husband Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is a daredevil explorer and Stifler (Seann William Scott) remains a braying jackass in his new life as an office flunky. Hopper Stone Universal Pictures Jason Biggs Eugene Levy and Seann William Scott reprise their roles in ""American Reunion."" There are mechanical reversals as amiable dull Jim desperately tries to escape the clutches of the lusty young woman he used to babysit. He must awkwardly offer love-life guidance to his now-widowed dad (the priceless Eugene Levy lighting up every scene). Glamorous Oz confesses that living la vida libido in L.A. is more of a grind than he could have imagined. Free spirit Finch whose self-described adventures are suspiciously hard to verify turns out to have a hidden dimension. There is not a polished pithy joke to be found. The script is a flavorless stew of soap opera level romantic humbug. Essentially the young Romeos who saw a couch as a place for a wrestling match have become listless bores whod use it for an afternoon of beer pizza and TV. The movies comic climax comes in a tacked-on end scene with Levy and Jennifer Coolidge as Stiflers bawdy mom. Its a hoot -- these old pros know how to pace build and pay off a gag -- but too little too late. As one often finds at reunions the years have not been kind the jokes are forced and its a relief when its over.

"American Reunion Getting the gang back together |       NJ.com comments American Reunion Getting the gang back together Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 06 2012 at 737 AM View/Post Comments Hopper StoneSeann William Scott left and Jason Biggs reprise their roles in the ""American Pie"" raunchy-comedy series in the new ""American Reunion."" Bye-bye this ""American Pie."" The franchise that started off 13 years ago with five sex-crazed teenagers and one badly treated pastry is back for a third sequel this time a high school reunion movie. And although it ends with hints of more the series should simply end period. Its past its sell-by date. The first movie had a certain novelty for just how hard it was willing to push at that R rating (although ""Theres Something About Mary"" had been dirtier and funnier earlier). At the time it felt a little risky. But after years of movies like ""The Wedding Crashers"" ""Superbad"" ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"" the bar has been raised. (Or seen another way standards have been lowered.) In any case just being dirty is no longer enough. You need characters too. ""American Reunion"" only has punch lines. Yes theres Jason Biggs hapless Jim the (frequently bare) butt of the storys most embarrassing sexual jokes. And Seann William Scotts mad Stifler the id of the group and the wildest character. (Not surprisingly both actors were the first to sign on). But can you remember any two facts about any of the three other guys? Theres nothing to them. Even the actors names -- which one is Thomas Ian Nicholas again and which one is Eddie Kaye Thomas? -- are weirdly interchangeable. Their problems in this film are similar too -- dull jobs problematic relationships a sense of encroaching middle-age. To which of course their answer is Dudes lets party And so they do reuniting in their old hometown and quickly indulging in all sorts of extreme misbehavior. Shots are downed clothes are lost identities are mistaken friendships are endangered -- and Stiflers mom is once again scarily insatiable. None of it makes much of an impression although there are a few nice and surprisingly heartfelt moments around the edges. Alyson Hannigan who has a sweet and mobile face is very good as Jims neglected wife. And for once the Muppet-browed Eugene Levy reels in the overacting for a few good scenes as Jims understanding father (who in his own weird way is one of the nicest dads in movies). But neither character gets much attention as the script works overtime to cram in everyone who was in the first movie. The strategy backfires as too many actors have too little to do. And their constant appearances are distracting evoking no memories (wait John Cho was in the original?) except that of old tacky gossip. (Boy Tara Reid Natasha Lyonne and Chris Klein -- you did keep the tabloids busy back in the day didnt you?) The film ends of course with a big par ty many more misunderstandings lots of crude jokes and the reunion itself. The five friends all have sex (although not with each other) and then meet up for a quick morning meal. ""We should do this once a year"" one pipes up. Somebody hit him. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations nudity strong language and drug and alcohol abuse. American Reunion (R) Universal (113 min.) Directed by Jon Hurwitz Hayden Schlossberg. With Jason Biggs Seann William Scott Chris Klein Thomas Ian Nicholas Eddie Kaye Thomas. Now playing in New Jersey.

Things have sunk to new lowbrow depths to include defecation in a beer cooler a toddler catching his dad watching porn and a raft of oral-sex jokes.Hopper Stone Universal PicturesReuniting and it feels no good American Reunion starring Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan retreads the well-worn ground of crass humor that has defined the series but fails to recapture the magic of the first film.EnlargeCloseHopper Stone Universal PicturesReuniting and it feels no good American Reunion starring Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan retreads the well-worn ground of crass humor that has defined the series but fails to recapture the magic of the first film.Sponsored LinksAn immature obsession with sex at 17 seems understandable. But at 30 its getting cringe-inducing.The 1999 teen sex comedy American Pie wasnt comic genius but it had some laughs as well as a few endearing moments which made its rough edges forgivable. Its latest sequel American Reunion (  out of four rated R opens Friday nationwide) trots out the same cast as they attend their 13th high school reunion. Even the non-superstitious will question the wisdom of this scenario. Their latest antics are a strained relentless quest for gross-out humor and outlandish sexual escapades.VIDEO American Reunion L.A. premiereMORE Shannon Elizabeth talks ReunionWhen we first met them the high school seniors were hellbent on losing their virginity. Obviously virginity has been long lost. But their horny compulsions havent changed much.Romantic coupling and the rekindling of old flames however dont induce the hoped-for nostalgia. A couple of situations generate laughs but whats mostly missing is the youthful spark that brought a sense of silly fun to the first movie.About the movieAmerican Reunion out of fourStars Seann William Scott Jason Biggs Alyson Hannigan Chris Klein Mena Suvari Thomas Ian Nicholas Eddie Kay Thomas Eugene Levy DirectorJon Hurwitz and Hayden SchlossbergDistributor Universal Pictures Rating R for crude and sexual content throughout nudity language brief drug use and teen drinking Running time 1 hours 50 minutes Opens today nationwideThe characters return to their Michigan hometown and the guys seek male bonding away from their wives and girlfriends. But Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) who married Jim (Jason Biggs) is hoping to rekindle their romance because the demands of parenting a 2-year-old have made passion scarce.Jim hangs out with the guys gets absurdly drunk and wakes up in the kitchen sans pants. Because hes now a husband and father the sight of him darting around using cabinets to hide his lack of drawers seems forced.As for the rest of the Pie pack theres Oz (Chris Klein) a slick sportscaster better known for his moves on a reality dance show. His former girlfriend Heather (Mena Suvari) is now a doctor. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a married man struggling to resist his high school sweetheart Vicky (Tara Reid). Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) regales his buddies with tales of globe-trotting. Stifler (Seann William Scott) appears the least changed with a dead-end job and no love interest or signs of maturity. He repeatedly makes crass jokes dusted off from his high school days.Then theres Stiflers randy mom (Jennifer Coolidge) and Jims now-widowed dad (Eugene Levy). Its not hard to figure out where their plotlines might lead. Theres also a new generation of raging hormones chiefly Jims nubile former neighbor Kara (Ali Cobrin) who is seeking deflowering.Jokes from the original are reprised (especially Jims awkward erotic video gone viral). It can be sentimental fun to see the gang back and reassembled. But its an uneven reunion.Given that there have been three other American Pie theatrical releases the cringing is probably going to continue. Who knows? The gang might still be indulging in frisky frolic once they retire in Boca. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 06 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Apr. 05 2012 407PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English More proof you can never go to home room again American Reunion finds the gang from East Great Falls High Class of 99 awkwardly joining together 13 years later. Jim and Michelle are married with a hyperactive toddler who prevents them from enjoying a satisfying sex life. Oz is a glum NFL cable analyst forced to celebrate younger men. Stifler - The Stifmeister - works in an investment office with beautiful women and (presumably) punitive fraternization rules. A scene from American Reunion. Universal Pictures Multimedia American Reunion Trailer American Reunions big joke is that the guys who once pledged to lose their virginity by prom night are after college mortgage and marriage hornier than ever. Thats a good one. But while it was cute watching teenage Jim (Jason Biggs) romance latticed pastry in American Pie; to see him slap a laptop shut on himself during a porn flick when his kid enters the room is just plain creepy. Besides you can only tell the same joke so often. Stifler (Seann William Scott) wanders through American Reunion in an ""Orgasm Donor"" T-shirt. Jim has been caught walking the dog so many times in the American Pie series his top should read ""Hand Solo."" American Pie was a cult hit in 1999 because it reduced the pressures of late adolescence - the challenge of looming adulthood getting into a good college a good job marriage and all that stuff - into a single diverting recreation getting laid. Though the series (eight films including four video spinoffs) has been successful we never really befriended its cast. Other high-school comedies introduced stars. Sean Penn ( Fast Times at Ridgemont High) Keanu Reeves ( Bill amp; Teds Excellent Adventure) and Jason Segel Seth Rogen and James Franco (TVs Freaks and Geeks) are but a few actors who started out as class clowns. Of the American Pie bunch only Scott who has seemingly cornered the market on wide-grinning idiots has made a lasting dent on the public imagination. And so a get-together of the not-so-famous Class of 99 confirms the perception that only losers attend high-school reunions. Sure enough the first half of American Reunion is a stumbling parade of misfired jokes and gross-out skits Jim and his dad (Eugene Levy) discover a stash of stuck-together mens magazines in Jims old room; Stifler gets back at high-school tormentors by fouling their beer cooler. And talk about sloppy storytelling. Once writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg ( Harold amp; Kumar) have wrung the last joke out of Jim and Michelles intrusive two-year-old the kid disappears from the picture. Poof But wait. Just when youre ready to drop out of American Reunion the high-school remedial comedy comes alive. Halfway through everyone starts drinking heavily and the film turns into agreeably sloppy fun. (Isnt that always the way - class reunions often perk up when someone spikes the punch.) Another plus In a couple of memorably funny scenes the filmmakers clear the deck and allow an inebriated Levy loose to romance the stoned Jennifer Coolidge who returns as Stiflers underdressed oversexed mom. It would be too much to suggest that American Pie Reunion is good to the last slice as the promo poster claims. What we can say is that the final post-credit scene a bawdy sequence that has Levy and Coolidge in a movie theatre with the actresss head dipping from sight is a fitting climax to what has been a memorably profane comedy franchise.

In the comedy all the ""American Pie"" characters we met a little more than a decade ago return to East Great Falls for their high-school reunion. Photo Credit Universal Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Thirteen years after ""American Pie"" the guys and gals attend their high school reunion. RATING R (nudity crude humor language) BOTTOM LINE Not as fresh as the original but theres plenty of raunchy fun left in the old gang. CAST Jason Biggs Alyson Hannigan Chris Klein Mena Suvari LENGTH 153 The heart may not be the first organ you think of when it comes to ""American Pie"" but that raunchy 1999 teen comedy did have one. Despite all the jokes about human excretions it understood that sex-crazed teenage boys have a sensitive side and that girls are indeed made of both sugar and spice. All in all a pretty accurate picture of adolescence. Those glimmers of truth may have been missing from the countless ""Pie"" sequels many of them straight-to-video releases with hardly a single original cast member. But ""American Reunion"" reconvenes the old gang in its entirety and as people like to say at high-school reunions they havent changed a bit. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break Theres something bittersweet about seeing so many appealing but largely vanished actors reinhabiting their youthful roles. Jason Biggs as Jim is still so baby-faced that you almost believe that his 18-year-old neighbor (Ali Cobrin) would strip nude to seduce him. Thomas Ian Nicholas as Kevin has the same soulful eyes while Eddie Kay Thomas again plays the slightly dark misfit Finch. As expected Seann William Scott as the tone-deaf party animal Stifler and Eugene Levy as Jims not-so-prudish father walk away with the most laughs. And what ever happened to Chris Klein and Mena Suvari as the likable jock Oz and his first love Heather? They once again provide the films sweetest most tender moments. Grown men reverting to adolescence may not be the freshest concept but writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg make it work partly by toning down the gross-out humor (slightly) and focusing more on memory lane. No spoilers here but nearly everyone from the first film makes an appearance (yes even Tara Reid). In the end ""American Reunion"" even gets away with its sequel-baiting closing line ""Till next time"" PLOT Thirteen years after ""American Pie"" the guys and gals attend their high school reunion. RATING R (nudity crude humor language) VideoTrailer American Reunion CAST Jason Biggs Alyson Hannigan Chris Klein Mena Suvari advertisement | advertise on newsday LENGTH 153 PLAYING AT Area theaters BOTTOM LINE Not as fresh as the original but theres plenty of raunchy fun left in the old gang.

Photo (c)Universal/courtesy Everett / Ev Years after band camp Alyson Hannigan is still turning in the same tired jokes. Harmless if not exactly inspired and rarely hilarious ""American Reunion is the genially smutty third big-screen sequel to the 1999 hit ""American Pie bringing back virtually the entire original cast absent from four lucrative direct-to-DVD prequels. Drawing libidinous inspiration from ""Theres Something About Mary (1998) the original ""Pie reinvented R-rated teenage comedies which had virtually disappeared since their 1980s heyday of ""Porkys and ""Risky Business. What seemed shocking the summer before the turn of the century -- most famously sexual congress with a dessert -- is now relatively tame compared with more recent raunchfests such as ""The Hangover and ""Bridesmaids. PHOTOS THE AMERICAN PIE CAST IN OTHER MOVIES And so are the antics of the guys who return for a 13-year reunion at East Great Falls High Jim (Jason Biggs) Oz (Chris Klein) Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and Stifler (Seann William Scott). This sequel is dominated by horndog Stifler who has resisted growing up more than the others (hes marginally employed as a temp) and is determined to help his more mature buddies still party like its 1999 sharing bongs with scantily clad underage cuties. The problem from a comic point of view is that theres no compellingly hilarious quest like in the first film when four of them were determined to lose their virginity. Jim married high school sweetheart Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) in ""American Wedding nine years ago and theyre now struggling to reignite their dormant sex life after the birth of a baby. Oz a television personality and Kevin have moved on to other relationships but are confronted by their high school flames Vicky (Tara Reid) and Heather (Mena Suvari). And poor Finch is still fixated on Stiflers oversexed mom (Jennifer Coolidge). But shes more interested in Jims dad (played as always by the ever-reliable Eugene Levy who was even in the prequels). Unfortunately these two stalwarts from the Christopher Guest stock company have disappointingly little screen time together. The sad fact -- adding possibly unintended poignancy to the proceedings -- is that Levy and Coolidge have had more lasting screen careers than any of the younger performers who were readily available to return for this sequel including Natasha Lyonne and Shannon Elizabeth. While the 80s have been celebrated endlessly in pop culture the 90s have repeatedly resisted such nostalgic revivals. Really who wants to be reminded of Mario Lopez who gets name checked in this movie? Still those who came of age then may be more inclined to laugh at scenes in which Jim has to sneak an inebriated half-naked teenager (Ali Cobrin) he used to baby-sit past her parents into her bedroom or when he turns up at a party in bondage gear. Somewhat funnier is a flashback to a dance competition featuring Oz. But overall the level of wit and invention from writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg is well below their scripts for the three ""Harold and Kumar"" movies. (That franchises mascot Neil Patrick Harris also has a cameo as himself here.) And then theres Stifler defecating in someone elses beer cooler. ""Youre a dick but youre our dick one of his buddies admiringly tells him. Generation X this buds for you.

I realize this now after sitting through a technical glitch-plagued screening of ""American Reunion"" another sequel to ""American Pie"" whose sense of humor is typified by a scene in which a grown man - Seann William Scott reprising his role as that virtuoso of vulgarity Steven Stifler - makes number two in a beer cooler. A malfunctioning audio system had accidentally removed all background music from the film (although the sound effect of Stiflers bowel movement unfortunately came through loud and clear). So imagine my delight when I was offered less than 24 hours later a second chance to see the film as it was originally meant to be seen - and heard - by the writing-directing team of Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg the auteurs behind ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay."" It was apparent that there were several jokes in ""American Reunion"" that relied heavily on the soundtrack of music from the 90s and beyond such as a scene in which a middle-aged mom does a pelvis-grinding dance with a shocked young man (Chris Klein as Chris ""Oz"" Ostreicher) to the tune of ""My First Kiss"" by 3OH3. Without the music it was just a bizarre pantomime. After two almost back-to-back screenings I can report that the songs add a certain something to the proceedings which are set during the high-school reunion of the characters from ""American Pie"" and depend on a sense of nostalgia for the 1999 film. The music is however like icing on an over-baked cake. With or without the tunes ""American Reunion"" is an aggressively crass - and not especially funny - trip down memory lane an attempt to recapture the sweetly ribald magic of the earlier film. As anyone whos ever attended a class reunion can tell you it almost never works. But dont take my word for it. Listen to Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) - the hero of the ""Pie"" movies who now has a wife and kid - as he scolds his ever-immature friend ""You are so trapped in the past Stifler. When are you going to realize that things are never going to be the way they used to be?"" Like Stifler ""American Reunion"" simply refuses to grow up. It may even have regressed. Certainly the obsession with sex has not changed. Almost all the characters from the first film have returned with their libidos intact and its a mild pleasure to see them especially Jims dad (Eugene Levy) whos now widowed and lonely. The subject of coupling uncoupling and re-coupling with exes - along with the de rigueur self-pleasuring - is almost the sole subject of conversation at this reunion despite a few moments of small talk about what people have done with their lives. Its a missed opportunity. Theres precious little comedy mined from the fact that people change. It is least-common-denominator humor. In fact it pushes R-rated movie boundaries If youve ever wondered what a nude Biggs looks like smooshed up against glass your prayers will be answered. At times however it goes beyond tweaking taboos to the downright inappropriate. A subplot about a neighborhood girl (Ali Cobrin) - shes turning 18 and has the hots for Jim her former babysitter - borders on the pedophiliac. Watching Stifler leer at her naked body as she lies passed out drunk isnt just unfunny. Its slightly creepy. No amount of music would cover that up. Contains Contains obscenity nudity comic violence drug references and a constant drumbeat of raunchy humor.

Directors Jon Hurwitz Hayden Schlossberg. (152) R Nudity language. At area theaters. They may seem like theyre thrown together like a last-minute dish but theres a formula to the ""American Pie"" movies Two long scenes at a party; add gross-out humor; dab a heart-to-heart in there; stir until overdone. ""American Reunion"" the latest and reputedly last in the series that began in 1999 sticks to the plan but spikes the punch just enough so that the tired but genial shenanigans come and go fast. This time as with the third entry 2003s ""American Wedding"" it focuses on Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) the ""perv"" and the ""band camp nympho"" who found love marriage and now an infant son since graduating from Michigans East Great Falls high 13 years ago. Alas real life ruins their bliss Parenthood Jims unspecified work in Chicago and Michelles mom duties at home have turned them into sexless dullards. Theyre hoping their high school reunion will spark some passion. Also arriving back in Michigan is Oz (Chris Klein) now a celebrity sportscaster in L.A.; Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) a happy househusband and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who says hes a globe-hopping adventurer. They of course wind up at a house party and find that at 30 theyre too old for house parties. While there Oz meets up with old flame Heather (Mena Suvari) while Kevin reconnects with his first love Vicky (Tara Reid). Jim meanwhile has to fend off the advances of the 18-year-old neighbor he used to babysit for. The fact that the whole gang has returned for the big reunion -- Natasha Lyonne and Shannon Elizabeth found time in their busy schedules to drop by -- doesnt provide the generational high producers thought it would; this isnt exactly the cast of ""American Graffiti."" The guys mostly fake-laugh at their pals ribbing as the girls look peeved at all the immaturity. (Reids squawky last-bar-call bleating is especially grating.) There are exceptions though. Eugene Levy has an amusing scene in which he gets unexpectedly buzzed and John Cho who went on to ""Harold amp; Kumar"" and J.J. Abrams ""Star Trek reboot reprises his ""guy who said Milf"" character in a Milf-speaking cameo (""Milf Milf? Milllf. "") What keeps the movie afloat though is Seann William Scott as Steve Stifler. Over four features Stiflers gone from annoying hanger-on to pet psycho blooming again as the arrival of Jim and Co. bring back his wacko side. In a franchise supposedly about ""letting it hang out Scott is its id embodying a pissed-off anarchy his milquetoast pals ""American Reunion"" and the ""Pie"" films as a whole can only dream about. Magic Moment Stifler proves his worth when a jackass needs to be coldcocked.

Starring Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott. Directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) What happens when horny teenagers grow up? They become horny grown-ups. Tough business getting older. If you doubt this I direct your attention to the carnally obsessed lads at the heart of ""American Reunion."" Anyone who saw ""American Pie"" or either of its sequels will recognize them nice kid Jim (Jason Biggs) slime-bucket Stifler (Seann William Scott) lacrosse jock Oz (Chris Klein) sensitive boyfriend Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and hipster-aesthete Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). When we first met this crew back in 1999 they were making a pact to pop their cherry. Now theyre reconvening at East Great Falls High School for their 10th reunion which gives them an excuse to party pass out defecate in unusual places obsess over sex ogle adolescent chicks riff on the pie-boinking scene from the first movie - and otherwise backslide psychosexually at every possible juncture. Jim and his wife the band-camp stunt-flutist Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) have an adorable 2-year-old and with him an obstacle to mutual marital satisfaction. Oz is a shiny celebrity sportscaster with a bubbleheaded girlfriend (Katrina Bowden) he appears to loathe and Kev now faithfully married to Ellie (Charlene Amoia) is feeling a tad emasculated in the kitchen. Finch ever the hepcat roars in on a red motorbike and talks of his adventures in South America. And Stifler? Hes a boot-licking temp at a securities firm. But dont be fooled by the leering bravado because deep down he suffers dude. This is a mistake. The Stifmeister should have nothing raging within but a gurgling concoction of stupidity and hormones. Then again the entire film is a mistake. Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (""Harold amp; Kumar"") direct with a bluntness witlessness and sloppiness that only brings out the chasmal vacancy of the script in which nothing happens and no one seems to be having any fun. ""American Reunion"" isnt a total wash. Its one saving grace is Eugene Levy as Jims dad. You can get him drunk get him high pair him off with a buxom lady friend take him to the movies and bounce popcorn on his ... lap and hes still the cutest pair of eyebrows in the business.

Everyone at East Great Falls High apparently missed their 10-year reunion but theyre all coming back for their 13th a bit bruised by their experiences in the real world which have apparently lacked the wacky shenanigans of their youth. Also read American Reunion On-the-Set Pics Offer Wholesome Prelude to Raunchy Hilarity Now that Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) are parents to a toddler theyre suffering marital-bed death and pursuing their orgasms separately. (Jim  online Michelle with the shower nozzle.) Oz (Chris Klein) is now a big-time sportscaster but hes saddled with a nympho-shrew girlfriend (Katrina Bowden) who forced him into a humiliating stint on a ""Dancing with the Stars""-ish show. Work-at-home architect Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) has become something of a henpecked husband while former nerd Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) breezes into town with tales of world travel and adventure. And then theres Stifler (Seann William Scott) whos a put-upon temp at work but still rude and crude in his off hours. And what about the women you ask? Well ""American Reunion"" doesnt seem to be particularly interested in them which is a pity since one of the bolder aspects of the ""American Pie"" series is its acknowledgment that teen girls can be just as horny as teen boys without being dirty dirty sluts. This time however theyre mostly plot-device set dressing for the fellas Did Oz make a mistake not settling down with Heather (Mena Suvari)? Can Kevins marriage survive the torch he still carries for Vicky (Tara Reid)? And if you were hoping that Natasha Lyonnes sardonic Jessica would inject some much-needed comedy into this dreary and sophomoric catastrophe shes relegated to just one scene towards the end during which the fading embers of ""American Reunion"" emit one last flash of light before completely dying out. The sex jokes of ""American Pie"" were raunchy yes but they were also kind of daring (13 years later were still talking about that titular baked good) and the films naughty content was balanced out by the sweetness of the characters. Thats a notion completely missed by ""Reunion"" writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (the guys behind the ""Harold amp; Kumar"" movies) who give the movie a misogynist streak a mile wide. Bad enough that the film is smutty and that most of the female characters are either bores or bitches but there are almost no laughs save what Scott valiantly squeezes out of Stiflers antics. Even old pros Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge (as Jims dad and Stiflers mom respectively) are given so little to do that I found myself thinking about how long its been since Christopher Guest made a movie. Some memories are best left in the past -- re-watch the first two ""American Pie"" movies if youre feeling nostalgia for these characters but avoid ""American Reunion."" Its the kind of get-together that makes you wonder if you ever liked these people in the first place. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Hopper Stone/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Hopper Stone/Universal Pictures American Reunion Director Jon Hurwitz Hayden Schlossberg Genre Comedy Running Time 128 minutes Rated R for crude and sexual content throughout nudity language brief drug use and teen drinking With Jason Biggs Alyson Hannigan Seann William Scott Chris Klein It was really too bad about the audio. Our press screening of American Reunion here in Washington was saddled with a muted soundtrack which is unfortunate for any movie let alone one that revolves around 90s music loud parties and a school dance. The audience laughed louder at ""I love this song"" than at any of Eugene Levys improv. So my take on Reunion is necessarily incomplete. But since I still had the privilege of watching Seann William Scott relieve himself in a beer cooler I think I got the gist of what the film has to offer and what the series as a whole has become. The takeaway Still funny but now with a much bleaker outlook. Forget about that pie for a minute. Gross-out gags were never the true hallmarks of the American movies. Theres a bigger reason this demented franchise has endeared itself to a demented generation emotional consistency. The Michiganders at its center grew up with the mindset that sex is the single most important thing in the world and all thats happened over the course of four movies and 13 years has for better or worse adhered to that principle. It sounds all fun and frivolous and maybe it was back in 1999 when four teens were willing to do just about anything to lose their virginity -- that scourge of high school. But those insecurities and those hormones burn just as strongly as ever in 2012. That One Time Credit Universal Pictures As American Reunion opens married-with-child protagonists Jim (Jason Biggs) and Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) confront this darkly comic reality headlong. Each half of the couple voracious bedroom appetites no longer satisfied by the other has independently elected to go solo. Whatever the opposite of a big chill is thats what it feels like to attend East Great Falls Highs 13-year reunion which most of the time feels like it could have just as easily been a one-year reunion. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Oz (Chris Klein) are still hung up on high school flames (Tara Reid and Mena Suvari) while the supposedly worldly Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) throws up tales of derring-do to score with the girl who got hot (Dania Ramirez new to the franchise). Now that these guys and girls are in their 30s with jobs and (in Jim and Michelles case) a family their constant quest for fulfillment has morphed from adolescent angst to hardened melancholy and suddenly things are more Shame than Stifler. Live by the tube sock die by the tube sock. Should we have expected the cast to finally find release? Of course not. If they werent still easily excitable thered be no point to the film. But the sands of time still shift for the Class of 99 just as they shift for the generation they represent. (Not my own; Im holding out for Superbad Reunion). The fact that the characters feel so real to those who grew up watching them is both a blessing and a curse because it makes all the gleeful immaturity glare in a peculiar way. Stifler Wisdom Credit Universal Pictures Consider that high school and college are usually our formative years and with luck people generally emerge on the other side a little stronger and wiser. You arent supposed to turn 30 acting like you just got home from prom. But the circumstances of the American franchise dont allow for natural maturation. The paradox is that in order to justify why we should still care about their lives these people need to assure us theyre all still as hopelessly horny as ever. A Jim who doesnt get caught pleasuring himself isnt really Jim at all. Its not all frozen assets. Writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg the duo who gave the world Harold and Kumar do make some valiant efforts to depict the shifting eras as when a Stifler scheme falls apart due to the existence of cellphones. Were also aware were dealing with different times because the filmmakers favor attractive yet dull new faces over gifted performers like Hannigan and Thomas. (And nauseatingly there are two separate sequences in which substance-addled girls throw themselves upon unwilling guys.) But mostly the gangs-all-here spirit causes Reunion to do a sort of reverse moonwalk looking backward while moving forward. Make no mistake its a thrill to see everyone again. Yet our inclination after nine years is to also look for progress -- and when redemption for the characters finally arrives it feels static (and silent too but that wasnt their fault). Its kind of sad in a way. To so many these Americans stand for something grander than sex -- and yet there was no way they could ever stand for anything but sex.

Pie launched two lame legit sequels and four direct-to video abominations. But dont despair. American Reunion reminds us what we liked about the original which featured four desperate-to-be-devirginized Michigan high school seniors - Jim (Jason Biggs) Oz (Chris Klein) Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Im not talking about the sight of Jim sticking his dick in Moms prize apple confection though the image is iconic and the reaction of Jims dad (the priceless Eugene Levy) even more so. Im referring to the way the movie sweetened its raunch to build a rooting interest in these characters even the obnoxious Stifler (Seann William Scott) a smutmeister with no lid on his libido. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The guys and the all-suffering babes who love and (hopefully) blow them are all back for this high school reunion. And its damn good to see them even when writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg of Harold amp; Kumar legend cant quite stop the movie from spinning out of control. No need to worry that these Peter Pans actually grow up. American Reunion is dedicated to the proposition that no matter how old you get you can stay immature forever. Hey Jim is actually married to Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) from band camp and they have a kid. Oz now an L.A. sportscaster and dance-show contestant (Kleins hip-hop moves are a thing of comic beauty) is long split from Heather (Mena Suvari) and happy with a new hottie (30 Rocks Katrina Bowden) until the school reunion ignites old fires. Kevin and Vicky (Tara Reid) have a less-successful rekindling. And Finch is forced to table his lust for Stiflers mom (the ever-amazing Jennifer Coolidge) when she takes a shine to Jims dad. Meanwhile Stiflers rage to get laid continues unabated - hell fake an interest in Twilight to tap high school girls. All the boundaries of good taste are crossed. Biggs gives it his comic all including a penis cameo. Scott is a hoot. And Klein in the films most nuanced performance shows how Oz grows a conscience. The laughs that do achieve liftoff are killer.

Hell Yeah The Class of 99 reconvenes to prove that turning 30 means embracing your inner teen idiot By Richard Corliss April 05 2012 Share Read Later Universal PicturesJason Biggs American Reunion Year 2012 Director Jon Hurwitz Hayden Schlossberg Studio Universal Pictures Actors Jason Biggs Alyson Hannigan Seann William Scott RelatedAmerican Reunion rounds up Pie cast again San Francisco ChronicleThis American Reunion saves the best for last Chicago Tribute Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The weeks big film news is the YouTube premiere of David Lynchs first public ""movie"" in six years Crazy Clown Time. This seven-minute video brings the lyrics of a song off the directors first solo album to lurid life. At a backyard party spinning of control one guy ""screamed so loud he spit""; another sets his lavish Mohawk on fire; a ripe blond ""ripped her shirt off completely"" -- all filmed in jittery hell-scape tableaux intercut with shots of the 66-year-old auteur wailing in the voice of piglet just before slaughter time. Its a deranged take on youthful bravura stoked by alcohol and anarchy and a way-more telling artful vision than this weeks other entry in post-teen misbehavior American Reunion. In 1999 American Pie wormed its way into the low-movie Pantheon with its depiction of East Great Falls High School seniors in various degrees of teen heat. Managing to blend in a single scene those two national icons masturbation and moms apple pie the movie became a big hit hatched one indelible character -- the manic cocksman Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott) -- and shepherded horny kids through puberty as National Lampoons Animal House and Porkys had done for their parents. Two sequels American Pie 2 and American Wedding were nearly as popular all topping the 100-million mark at the domestic box office but the series quickly devolved into direct-to-video spinoffs. (SEE Top 10 Movie Franchises That Wont Die) Now in a meager Stimulus Act for its underremembered cast American Reunion reconvenes the actors and many of the old jokes for a slapdash essay on the perils of hitting 30 -- which the movie suggests is like falling out of bed and landing on barbed wire. Gone is the priapic innocence of high school when one boy could write in his yearbook that he ""hopes to have the sex life of Ricky Martin."" As they prepare for their 13th-year reunion Jim (Jason Biggs) is mired in a sexless marriage with his teen sweetheart Michelle (Alyson Hannigan); the jock Oz (Chris Klein) is a minor celebrity still wincing from a loss to Gilbert Gottfried on a Dancing With the Stars-type show; Stifler is working as a temp for a ruthless boss; and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas)... well their problem is that nobody cares what their problems are. In one of Reunions vagrant lurches into truth-telling Jim asks Stifler ""When are you gonna realize that things are never gonna be like they used to be?"" Yet the recipe used by writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg who did the Harold amp; Kumar movies ordains that everything should be exactly the way it once worked. Jim the kid who seduced the pie is again caught in a compromising position in the kitchen. (Penis alert) Guys and gals from the first film now thicker and with incipient crow lines pair up in more or less the same permutations as when they were young and shiny. The movies message is that the way to face impeding maturity is to embrace your inner teen idiot. (SEE Our toke -- sorry take -- on A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas) Hurwitz and Schlossberg do run a few variations on the wages of sin post-graduate division. Stifler finally hooks up with a girl he fondly recalls as ""the mouth that got away""; when he agrees to be the donor not the receiver in a session of oral sex he gets a tart lesson in growing up. Jim always a figure of repressed sexual panic has become the dream beau of Kara (the preternaturally luscious Ali Cobrin) a child he used to babysit for and who is just turning a hot 18. For other 30-year-old men the availability of a gorgeous drunk naked besotted teen who hungers for deflowering might be an enticement; for Jim its a test of marital fidelity and not even mildly tempting. The films only inspired unfraught coupling involves Jims dad and Stiflers mom (Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge otherwise partnered in three of Christopher Guests improv comedies) -- but to see that youll have to stay for the closing credits. The movie keeps bursting into comic situations whose implications it then tiptoes away from. The scene of Jim and the randy inebriated Kara in a car summons the memory of the oral-sex chapter in John Irvings The World According to Garp; that encounter ended in castration this in mere embarrassment. Another segment has Karas creepy boyfriend swiping bikini tops from beach bunnies with Stifler and his pals in angry pursuit. But it never occurs to our heroes that they should liberate the stolen bras and return them to their grateful owners. The guys are just revenging a slur on their collective manhood which Stifler caps by taking a crap in the bad guys beer cooler. Ah 30 As Houston Astros pitcher Larry Anderson sagely remarked ""Youre only young once but you can be immature forever."" (SEE Top 10 Movie Parties) How many more times can the American posse be immature for our tentative pleasure? Another much more elevated movie series -- Michael Apteds landmark documentary chronicle that began in 1963 with Seven Up -- has traced the lives of a dozen or so English people from childhood through early and late middle-age with a new episode every seven years. (56 Up is due later this year.) I wouldnt encourage it but the East Great Falls High class of 99 could return every decade to face new challenges while displaying the same case of arrested development. Or they could be really ballsy and let David Lynch direct the next sequel. Jim screams so loud he spits. Stifler sets his hair on fire. Oh thatd be Crazy Clown Time for sure.

Slideshow Guard your pies; the guys are back Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about American Reunion >> And youre married now and you have a little kid whos developing a rash. Yes adulthood - of a sort - figures into the equation in American Reunion a Generation Y raunchfest that reteams the principals of the 1999 R-rated smash American Pie (and its most distinguished sequels) for a 13-years-on high school get-together. Jim (Jason Biggs) Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) Oz (Chris Klein) and Stifler (Seann William Scott) reassemble in East Green Falls for their Class of 99 celebration. Its a reunion that finds the old friends grappling with new dilemmas. For Jim the problem is how to keep the marriage fresh. (And how to get people to stop cracking Adam Sandler look-alike jokes.) American Reunion opens with our hero on his laptop navigating a porn site and Jims highschool-sweetheart-turned-wife Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) in the bathtub navigating with a showerhead. Both are caught in the act - onanism interruptus. But at least they talk about it and vow to spend some serious time over the weekend getting physical - with each other. However a party-hearty agenda - not to mention the ""smokin hot 18-year-old"" Kara (Ali Cobrin) with the fond memories of her babysitter - threatens to torpedo Jim and Michelles plans. Speaking of torpedoes there is Stifler a relentless lout who encourages Jim to philander with the birthday girl and ""take what you learn from Kara bring it home and apply it to Michelle."" What Stifler does to a cooler of beer in another scene - its an act of revenge - is similarly ill-advised. In some ways American Reunion is the Charlize Theron indie Young Adult all over again In both a small-town high school reunion is the setting for a lot of nostalgia and narcissism and nasty behavior. Jason Reitman directed Young Adult and got Theron to bare her soul; Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg direct American Reunion and get a bevy of actresses to bare their breasts. And get Biggs to go full frontal. While the focus is still on the guys (Finch is living a pseudo-sophisticate lie Ozs sex bomb of a girlfriend isnt bringing happiness into his life etc.) American Reunion does take some effort to show how the girls are making out so to speak. In addition to American Pie veterans Vicky (Tara Reid) and Heather (Mena Suvari) there is newcomer Selena (Dania Ramirez) whom nobody paid attention to back in school and who now fixes drinks - and transfixes the male clientele - at the local bar. In addition to Levy playing Jims advice-doling dad and Jennifer Coolidge as Stiflers legendary mom Rebecca DeMornay makes an (uncredited) appearance as another of the American Pie/American Reunion parentals. I suppose its a spoiler to say who ends up out on the football field in the middle of the night clinching with Finchs mom. But somebody does. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

For anyone wondering where actors like Jason Biggs Mena Suvari Chris Klein and Tara Reid have been hiding this third ""American Pie"" sequel is like lifting a rock and discovering theyve just been pretty much waiting for this. ""American Reunion"" is the first of these movies in nine years (ignoring the straight-to-DVD spinoffs) and its a sign of its desperation to exist that the high school reunion in the title is the ""big 13th."" Perhaps the thinking was that had the filmmakers waited for 15 or 20 no one would care. But just to be clear 13 is how many years have passed since the first film. Its also a number thats such bad news that elevators skip it all together.Nonetheless ""American Reunion"" is a prematurely disinterred time capsule that enlists the cast of the previous films to reconvene in their Southern California hamlet for adventures in horniness. Imagine cartons of expired milk drinking and ogling and falling down. The characters are now in their 30s. But that number no longer has any real cultural meaning (there are lots of 30-year-old teenagers). Alyson Hannigan whos 38 has played Michelle -- the dirty nerdy flutist - in every movie and looks as if she could still be on her way to band camp.But Michelle and Jim (Jason Biggs) who once were terminally horny now have a son which means any sex they have they have solo. The movie tries two or three times to rekindle whatever was once special or fun in seeing Biggs humiliated in behalf of Jims hormones and culminates with him on a lawn in Samp;M attire. All it did rekindle for me were grim memories of Rosie ODonnell and Dan Aykroyd in ""Exit to Eden.""In other news Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is married. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) rides a motorcycle and wears a scarf. Oz (Klein) is a TV celebrity. And Stifler (Seann William Scott) is the only reason to considering enduring any of this. The character began the series as an amusing sideshow - this wild walking one-man party - but wound up as the centerpiece of the sequels.His eventual prominence might have had something to do with the writing which for ""American Reunion"" has shrunk to nothing. But really its that Scotts vulgar relentlessness remains funny. He should be tired of having to scrunch his face and exclaim obscenities. Yet when given the opportunity say to defecate into a cooler while chugging a beer or expressing implosive bafflement over the pending nuptials of two gay lacrosse buddies Scott does so with gusto. Not even a T-shirt Stifler wears that reads ""orgasm donor"" upstages Scott.Hes not the only comedian here. John Cho isnt bad as a creepy voyeur. Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge have two good scenes together as Jims dad and Stiflers mom. (One scene with a bobbing tub of popcorn occurs during the closing credits; Im not saying to stick around but its well done.) They and Scott dont elevate the movie so much as dash some seasoning that momentarily dispels the blandness. Additional old cast members - Shannon Elizabeth Natasha Lyonne - are carted out in a way that confirms only that theyre still alive.The same cannot be said for the movie. Thats a shame since the writer-directors Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have either written or directed three smart sharp ""Harold amp; Kumar"" comedies. Their sweet spot is farce which they dont even try for here. ""American Reunion"" runs on misunderstandings breakups and makeups many of which are simply remembered or recycled from the original movie. The directors dont know how to make this new plot funny or infectious. Most promises of comedic pleasure go as unfulfilled Stiflers T-shirt. This movie hasnt a clue where to begin the donation process.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

American Reunion Fair Directors Jon Hurwitz Hayden Schlossberg. Cast Jason Biggs Alyson Hannigan Seann William Scott. Rating R for crude and sexual content throughout nudity language brief drug use and teen drinking. Sure. What else explains Kiss still selling enough tickets to tour continuously? The people behind ""American Reunion"" which reunites the original cast of ""American Pie"" are counting on just such a feeling of fondness for the past of good memories for a film that was dirtier than it was good (though that doesnt mean it wasnt funny). Of course many folks are more devoted to ""American Pie"" than I am. The 1999 film a surprise hit helped kick off a revival of R-rated comedies and for that it should be saluted. ""American Reunion"" written and directed by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg catches up with the characters 13 years later and its sort of like visiting your hometown and running into that kid you kind of sort of knew in high school. You werent asking for an update but its pleasant enough to get one. The gangs all here and descending on East Great Falls for a 13th high-school reunion. (Why 13? Who knows? If thats the kind of detail you get hung up on this is probably not the movie for you.) Jim and Michelle (Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan) are now married with a son and while Jims raunchy exploits from the first film are in the movies universe the stuff of viral YouTube legend the seemingly happy couples relationship has lost its romance -- which again in this movies universe means they no longer have sex. Meanwhile Oz (Chris Klein) is an anchor for an ESPN-like network and a former contestant on a ""Dancing With the Stars""-like competition. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is a househusband Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) a bohemian world traveler Heather (Mena Suvari) a doctor Vicky (Tara Reid) a businesswoman and Stifler (Seann William Scott) ... well hes still Stifler profane and insane. Like Jim and Michelle everyones lives are not as happy as they seem and as must happen in all reunion movies their problems will be smoothed out by the end of the weekend but not before being exacerbated first. Trouble arrives in many forms most notably in the admirable form of Kara (Ali Corbin) the formerly little girl who lives next door to Jims dad (Eugene Levy) for whom Jim baby-sat and is now all grown up. Or almost; shes turning 18 and looking to lose her virginity identifying Jim as a prime candidate for the job. This echoes of course the first film in which Jim Finch Oz and Kevin seek to lose their virginity and is just one of many callbacks to the original. Stiflers mom (Jennifer Coolidge) is still around for instance and there is an amusing twist on what happened with her the first time around. There are in fact a few amusing bits if not a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. And there is also a sweetness. Theres nothing new here -- ""American Reunion"" really is at heart a pat take on the high-school reunion movie -- but the characters genuinely like each other and welcome a chance to get together again. Some like Jim and Michelle are likable (Hannigan remains especially game). Some arent particularly (sorry Tara Reid though her character is sorely underwritten). And Stifler ... well again hes still Stifler. Scott brings a certain unhinged quality to his roles and its welcome here. But if ""American Pie"" rekindled our love for R-rated comedy Judd Apatows stable of films like ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" and all the rest raised the bar for them. The raunch-with-heart stories have been told many times since the original and told better. ""American Reunion"" depends more on the audiences feelings for recognizable characters than telling an original story so adjust your expectations accordingly.

American Reunion (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review American Reunion (R) The fourth installment in the popular R-rated comedy franchise is showing its age. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/5/2012 Editor rating 2 Nearly 10 years after American Wedding the third -- and it once seemed last -- installment in the popular American Pie franchise the gangs all back for a fourth go-around. The actors many of them now in their mid-30s look understandably fuller in the face and thicker around the waist. The jokes too are starting to show their age They wobble and limp where they once sprinted. American Reunion has all of the ingredients that made the previous Pies so popular outrageous bits of explicit sexual comedy; sudden in-your-face shots of nude body parts; incredibly inappropriate (but sweet and funny) situations; some revolting gross-out gags; and a prevailing affection for this large cast of characters who never quite imprinted the popular culture as deeply as the Animal House or The Hangover crew did but are still likable and fun and a perfectly fine gang to hang with for a couple of hours. The problem with American Reunion which was written and directed by Jon Hurvitz and Hayden Schlossberg ( Harold amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay) is that the movie never overcomes the feeling that it is -- above all else -- an attempt to wring a few more dollars out from a once-profitable franchise. Although the actors are game -- Jason Biggs remains as fearless as ever to humiliate himself for the sake of a laugh and Seann William Scott has elevated Stiflers man-child antics to John Belushi heights -- theres a draggy by-the-numbers feel to the picture There isnt a single surprise in it. The movie is just more of the same only now the characters are adults which makes their horny-adolescent antics less funny. You keep wanting to tell them to grow the hell up. The premise of American Reunion in which everyone flies home for their 12th high school reunion and catches up with each other is that no matter what paths their lives and careers took everyone reverts to his old self the moment hes back in the adolescent milieu. The directors have managed to round up nearly every single actor who ever made an appearance in the films which means some are going to get a lot more time than others. Chris Klein is funny as a TV news reporter who because famous after a controversial stint on a Dancing with the Stars-type TV show Tara Reid whose face has been Botoxed to the point of immobility is wisely relegated to a couple of brief scenes. Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge steal the film outright from their younger co-stars showing them how its done. American Reunion makes a half-hearted attempt to explore how to juggle marriage and parenthood without losing track of your inner child. But that forces what should have been a rambunctious no-holds-barred comedy to pause for scenes involving heart-to-heart conversations and other mature grown-up nonsense. The script is also lazy Whenever theres a scene in which Biggs and Alyson Hannigan need to be somewhere without their baby they conveniently just drop him off at her grandmothers house eliminating the dilemma of parents who want to have fun without ignoring their child. The movie wont seem nearly as funny if you havent seen the first three American Pies -- for one thing you will miss a lot of in-jokes -- but the kids who grew up watching those pictures are probably too old to enjoy the tomfoolery of the new film. American Reunion has its moments and there are a couple of great raunchy bits here but it also reminds you that sometimes skipping that high school class reunion isnt necessarily a bad thing. Cast Jason Biggs Alyson Hannigan Chris Klein Thomas Ian Nicholas Seann William Scott Tara Reid Mena Suvari Eugene Levy Jennifer Coolidge. Writers-directors Jon Hurvitz Hayden Schlossberg. Producers Chris Moore Craig Perry Chris Weitz. A Universal Pictures release. Running time 113 minutes. Vulgar language considerable nudity sexual situations drug use and other naughty behavior.

"American Reunion Review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs This American Reunion saves the best for last ??April 05 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticSweeping aside the films weirdest unasked question -- who goes to their 13th high school reunion? -- the characters created by Adam Herz for the 1999 hit ""American Pie"" return for a rather tired sequel called ""American Reunion"" in which poor desperate Jim Levensteins genitals once again get their ears boxed (metaphorically speaking) and Stiflers way with nubile 17-year-olds doesnt seem quite as obnoxiously sprightly as it once did given that Stifler is now supposed to be in his early 30s and the actor Seann William Scott is 35.The movie acknowledges this queasy disconnect though acknowledging it doesnt make it much funnier. Everyone in the ensemble keeps pushing the woebegone nostalgia angle pining for lost youth eager to reactivate now-dormant sex lives. Every other line it seems refers to ""back in the day"" or ""wasnt this more fun when we were younger?"" or how ""old"" theyre feeling. Youd think this was a remake of ""Cocoon.""""American Pie"" and the better parts of the second one proved that the right combination of hard-R-rated raunch and occasional sincerity was golden. Those films were followed by ""American Wedding"" and four direct-to-DVD spinoffs.The through-line linking all eight including ""American Reunion"" has been Eugene Levy as Noah Levenstein now a widower still dispensing awkward advice to his son played by Jason Biggs.The plot you know even if you dont. The East Great Falls Mich. reunion weekend brings together Jim Stifler haute poseur Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas adroitly treading the line between ""deadpan"" and ""bored"") sportscaster Oz (Chris Klein) and the other guy Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) now bearded and married. Jim and his band-camp-derived wife Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) have fallen into a nonsexual rut since the birth of their son. The opening scene in the sequel from writers-directors and ""Harold amp; Kumar"" alums Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg presents dueling-masturbation scenarios under the same exhausted-spouse roof.Now and then the movie rouses itself to deliver. If you go to ""American Reunion"" -- and many will if they harbor fond memories of the first one and if they can find a sitter -- you should stay through the end credits. Levy and Jennifer Coolidge (Stiflers mom) are on a date at a movie theater and while the ensuing joke is as old as time the way Levy finesses it you wonder if the ""American Pie"" franchise wouldve gotten half as far as it has without him.For the record the movies cinematography and editing are pure hack work drab and jumpy and jammed with full-face close-ups. Not good for comedy.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Hopper Stone) Hopper Stone In this image released by Universal Pictures Jason Biggs is shown in a scene from ""American Reunion"". (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Hopper Stone) Remember your 13th high school reunion? Of course not because such things dont exist. But if you graduated from high school circa 1999 you probably remember ""American Pie"" as a breakthrough comedy and so do the producers of ""American Reunion"" the umpteenth sequel in the series.When last we partied with the dudes from East Falls High School sex-obsessed Everyman Jim (Jason Biggs) was marrying Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) the seemingly wholesome redhead who learned some naughty tricks at band camp. Eight years later the couple are in a rut and their toddler son is putting a crimp on Jims private Web browsing.Have no fear -- this installment is front-loaded with the gimmicks that worked in the previous movies genital-trauma and bodily-fluid humor. But its also filled with secondary characters who were never that interesting to begin with. Alongside guilty-pleasure gags involving belligerent horndog Stifler (Seann William Scott) and Jims square but sexually frank dad (Eugene Levy) we get cursory subplots about married Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and free-bird Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) reuniting with sympathetic classmates (Tara Reid and Dania Ramirez respectively). Returning to the fold is Oz (Chris Klein) who missed the wedding while he worked at a TV sports network. During the reunion weekend hes towing a model named Mia (skimpily clad scene-stealer Katrina Bowden) but pining for lost love Heather (Mena Suvari) whose boyfriend (Jay Harrington) is a cardiologist -- and an admirer of Ozs swinging lifestyle.For added sexual tension there is Kara (Ali Cobrin) the neighbor that Jim used to baby-sit who celebrates her 18th birthday at a bikini party that the 30-ish dad crashes. Although the ""American Pie"" series is no longer baked by the Weitz brothers who opened a franchise between sensitive John Hughes and salacious Judd Apatow their recipe is intact. The split of hormonal sleaze to cornball sap is still about 50/50 yet like a chance meeting with an old love it doesnt produce the expected magic. Theres some laughing gas left in the cupboard but this series may require an infusion of new blood to last until ""American Funeral.""""America Reunion""Two and a half stars (out of four)  Rating R  Run time 153  Content Crude sexual humor nudity strong language and substance abuse Videos Watch a trailer for American Reunion Apr 4 2012 (...)

But it was also a sweet slice of teenage B-movie nostalgia that brought off the neat trick of looking forward and back at the same time. The picture paid affectionate homage to Porkys (1982) and all the other harmlessly scurrilous virgins-getting-laid farces of the 80s. Yet it also took a generational leap The famous scene in which Jason Biggs slapped his ass as he did a hilariously embarrassing strip dance only to learn his antics had been beamed all over the Internet advertised the new technology and the new attitude that went with it -- one in which boys like girls were now going to see themselves as sex objects. The joke of American Pie was that the peepers would now be peeped on. After the flavorless American Pie 2 (2001) and the downright stale American Wedding (2003) the joke it seemed was squeezed dry. So why would anyone want to see American Reunion which reassembles those sexually hapless boys 13 years later? As it turns out the recipe has been updated and what once seemed like fatally warmed-over Pie tastes new again. Biggs Jim Levenstein now the beleaguered dad of a toddler has been reduced to sneaking in glimpses at porn sites while his wife Michelle (the ever-adorable Alyson Hannigan) pleasures herself in the bathtub. The frustration of two parents trapped in a dead zone of masturbation may well be rote comedy fodder. But when Jim gets together with his old pals on the eve of a high school reunion and we learn that most of them are in steady relationships that cant keep up with their libidos the films theme comes to the fore. American Reunion is about the comedy of middle-class men who cant be satisfied with sex until it looks like porn. And so it is that Jim is set upon by Kara a high school girl he used to babysit and the temptation keeps generating laughs. Ali Cobrin who plays her has the slightly dazed sparkle of the young Liz Taylor and Biggs with his awkward frown-smile turns his face into a rubbery billboard of pain and desire. Chris Kleins Oz hasnt aged as well Hes now a leathery sportscaster with a trophy-shrew girlfriend (Katrina Bowden) and the dubious claim to fame of an appearance on Celebrity Dance-Off and Klein never alters his look of stoic abashment. Thomas Ian Nicholas and Eddie Kaye Thomas give off even more of a were-happy-to-have-this-paycheck vibe but Seann William Scott grabs the film like a sex toy he wont let go of. He makes Stifler who has never grown up into more than just the movies id -- hes its violently arrested soul. Then theres the great Eugene Levy. As Jims widowed father so uptight hes a Talmudic dweeb of pleasure he gets to let loose in ways that are just dirty enough to make him feel like hes being punished. When his initiation into the ways of raunch is complete he announces ""I honestly think I had fun."" After American Reunion I can say the same thing.

You probably havent been lying awake in bed at night wondering whatever became of Stifler and Oz and the rest of the horny kids from the original ""American Pie"" movie.Yet here they are after 13 years and a couple of sequels in ""American Reunion."" And theyre more bland than bawdy these days.Thats part of the joke that they (and we) arent in high school anymore that we all have to grow up and function as adults with responsibilities and whatnot. We cant spend all our time thinking lascivious thoughts about pastry. Thats just adolescent.But that doesnt make for a very fun or funny movie; instead ""American Reunion"" relies on cliches about nostalgia forced tension over strained friendships and melodrama about the rekindling of first loves.Jim and Michelle (Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan) are now married with a 2-year-old son and zero sex life. But they return to their Michigan hometown for a 10-year high school reunion thats being staged three years late because supposedly no one could get their act together on time. Its a plot contrivance leave it at that.There they run into the old gang including Chris Klein as Oz whos now a slick sports anchor Eddie Kaye Thomas as the sophisticated Finch and Seann William Scott as Stifler whos still ... Stifler. Tara Reid and Mena Suvari show up as personality-free blonde robots Vicky and Heather respectively. And really the women get short shrift here. Theyre either boring good girls or sexually aggressive nymphets with no shadings of substance or complexity in between.""Harold amp; Kumar"" creators Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg take over as writers and directors but the sense of unpredictability that infused their own franchise never surfaces here. Plus this kind of raunchy hard-R comedy has been done -- and done better -- countless times since ""American Pie"" debuted and seemed fresh in 1999. Movies like ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and even the recent hockey flick ""Goon"" (which also stars Scott) have found a way to push boundaries more daringly while simultaneously finding an unexpected resonant sweetness.""American Reunion"" achieves neither of these extremes and playing intrusive cloying music to signal that certain moments are supposed to be special isnt terribly persuasive. The few moments the film gets right -- which is true of the whole series -- involve Eugene Levy as Jims awkward but well-intentioned dad. A grieving widower he misses his son and longs for the companionship of a woman once more.He has a couple of moments with Stifler and even with the notorious Stiflers mom (Jennifer Coolidge brash as ever) which bring a temporary loveliness to the proceedings. Then again he also has to go through the obligatory trying-on-clothes montage as he prepares to take a photo for his online dating profile -- yet another cliche.""American Reunion"" a Universal Pictures release is R for crude and sexual content throughout nudity language brief drug use and teen drinking. Running time 105 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.------Motion Picture Association of America rating definitionsG -- General audiences. All ages admitted.PG -- Parental guidance suggested.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet When the U.S. made American Pie a hit 13 years ago did we realize we were signing up for a decade-spanning commitment? Its not like the characters in the by-turns vulgar and sweet original demanded we check in with them every couple of years to see how they were doing. In fact once the central quartet of Thomas Ian Nicholas Jason Biggs Chris Klein and Eddie Kaye Thomas succeeded in losing their virginity in the first film their stories didnt really have anywhere to go. And yet go they went through two previous sequels (in 2001 and 2003). The franchise then carried on through a series of direct-to-DVD movies keeping only Eugene Levy--who plays the father of Biggs character--as connective tissue. But now its apparently time to check back in with the original gang including those like Klein Mena Suvari and Tara Reid who exited the series for potentially greener cinematic pastures earlier in the decade. The occasion the Class Of 1999s 13th-anniversary reunion. (Why didnt they have a 10-year anniversary? Its glossed over in a line of dialogue.) So whats everyone up to? Pretty much variations on what they were up to in the other three American Pie movies. Now married to Alyson Hannigans former band-camp debauchee Biggs has transitioned from the sexual humiliations of teendom to the sexual disappointment of married-with-kids adulthood. Klein has become a famous sportscaster who cant fully live up to his own reputation and the lifestyle of his hard-partying girlfriend (30 Rocks Katrina Bowden) Nicholas finds new ways to anger his ex (Reid) and Thomas continues to act worldlier than his small-town Michigan upbringing allows. Meanwhile group outlier Seann William Scott behaves like a malevolent puppy testing the limits of his friends patience and steering them toward the nudity- and feces-heavy antics fans of the films have come to expect. And in spite of the new writing and directing team--Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg of the Harold And Kumar movies--American Reunion delivers exactly whats expected and at the come-what-may pace the earlier entries established. Filled with more characters and subplots than Middlemarch American Reunion has a lot of business to attend to and takes its time getting it done working through a checklist of items from previous films in the process. Levys heart-to-heart talks with Biggs provide the comic highlights just as they did before. The film alternates sloppily executed sex gags with sentiment as did its predecessors. And its all just slightly more endearing and amusing than it has any right to be. Theres no real reason to revisit these characters but the cast makes it pleasant enough. While Reid Klein and Suvari never relax into their old roles everyone else is game enough to commit to the teen-sex-comedy equivalent of a deathless band playing the hits you remember just like you remember them.

"Review American Reunion not nearly enough fun - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview American Reunion not nearly enough funBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury NewsPosted 04/04/2012 120000 PM PDTUpdated 04/05/2012 063129 AM PDTClick photo to enlarge In this image released by Universal Pictures Thomas Ian Nicholas left and Tara Reid are shown in a scene from ""American Reunion"". (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Hopper Stone) <<1234>> In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers American Reunion Free Men The Island President The ""American Pie"" franchise shows some unflattering wrinkles with ""American Reunion"" a mediocre and all-too obvious sequel that utterly fails to recapture the youthful spark of its original. And what a disappointment that is. The 1999 gut-buster remains one of our funniest raunchy comedies and its antics remain seared into our collective pop-culture consciousness. Who can forget the seemingly virtuous Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) recounting her exploits in ""band camp"" or Jim (Jason Biggs) and his encounter with a warm apple pie? Nothing in ""Reunion"" -- which gathers original cast mates now as early thirtysomethings for this installment -- remotely approaches those wild high jinks. ""Reunions"" failure could be attributed to its own success. ""Pie"" which was followed by two sequels -- ""American Pie 2"" and ""American Wedding"" -- could be partially credited for paving the way for edgy go-for-broke recent fare such as ""The Hangover"" ""Bridesmaids"" even ""21 Jump Street."" But compared to those belles of the comic ball ""American Reunion"" is simply a wallflower.Directors and screenwriters Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg (creators of ""Harold and Kumar"") tease out a few chortles but theyre sporadic and dont have much zing. In fact one of the biggest laughs comes at the films end -- so dont dash out of the theaters assuming you make it that far. Advertisement The biggest disappointment is the lack of oh-my-God-are-they-really-going-to-do-that comedic shockers which are pretty much the hallmark of this series. We get a full-on gander at scrunched-up male genitals but its silly not outright hilarious.Gross-out humor gets sprinkled in here and there yet it all seems stale juvenile and much too icky. Even the reunion scenario fails to live up to expectations with the actual event generating muted laughter at best while clumsily wrapping up all the relationship melodrama.The actors give it their all but the characters like the film itself remain stuck in a 1999 rut. Jim is still pleasuring himself but he is now fending off the ludicrous advances of an 18-year-old he used to baby-sit while trying to mend a sexless marriage to Michelle. Stifler (Seann William Scott) remains the sociopath resorting to dumb and dumber tricks to avoid being an adult. ""Oz"" (Chris Klein -- good to have you back) is a sportscaster and former reality TV contestant involved with a vapid model (Katrina Bowden) but still toying with an old flame Heather (Mena Suvari). Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is tempted by Vicky (Tara Reid). And Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) talks about an exciting and adventurous life while romancing Selena (Dania Ramirez).None of the problems these characters encounter is nearly as interesting as what the parents are up to. Eugene Levy as Jims nerdy dad and Jennifer Coolidge as Stiflers sexpot mom show the kids up with Levy tapping into some tender emotions as a still grieving husband.But theyre only side notes in a sequel that seems an awful lot like an Adam Sandler comedy.""American Reunion"" isnt nearly as bad but thats not much of a compliment. After three films ""Reunion"" should have graduated up to bigger and better things.American Reunion   Rating R (for crude and sexual content throughout nudity language brief drug use and teen drinking)Cast Jason Biggs Seann William Scott Alyson Hannigan Tara Reid Chris Klein Mena Suvari Eugene Levy Jennifer CoolidgeDirectors Jon Hurwitz Hayden SchlossbergRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Nearly every scene in ""American Reunion"" is slathered in something warm and gooey -- namely nostalgia. Thirteen years out of high school the ""Pie"" guys are hitting their 30s in a mellower more reflective mood with plenty of downtime between horny hijinks to remember the good ol days. But while its poignant seeing the whole gang again the tired gross-out antics and limp romantic reprisals keep this hapless if heartfelt effort from qualifying as a decent comedy let alone a generational classic. Sans big laughs or even mild outrage the pic has sentimental value but wont score as aggressively as its predecessors. Having tied the knot in 2003s ""American Wedding"" Jim and Michelle Levenstein (Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan) now have a toddler son and a reasonably stable life together. But their sex life has fallen into a rut as seen in a prologue that begins with one of the franchises signature self-gratification gags and unexpectedly morphs into a ruefully honest look at marital frustration. Its a promising start for a movie that as written and directed by series newcomers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg means to examine its characters various stages of discontent as they head home for their high-school reunion. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) sporting a hipster goatee is happily wed but finds his thoughts drifting on occasion to his ex Vicky (Tara Reid). Chris Ostreicher aka Oz (Chris Klein) is a TV personality with a wildly sexy g.f. (Katrina Bowden) but hes starting to realize the downsides of fame and fortune. Cultured adventurous Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) shows up on a badass motorcycle with tales of crazy bohemian travels abroad. Last and never least Stifler (Seann William Scott) is stuck in a lowly temp job though a suit and tie havent curbed his juvenile horndog tendencies one bit. And so old friends are reunited familiar stomping grounds revisited and past relationships promisingly rekindled particularly in the case of Oz and high-school sweetheart Heather (Mena Suvari). Along the way the guys keep running into teenagers who seem far more immature and sexually voracious than they did at that age or so theyd like to think. At times the pic evokes the sense of social disorientation that arises when tail-end Gen Xers realize Gen Y has passed them by In an era when kids think nothing of swapping nude self-portraits online that naughty video encounter between Jim and Czech exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) in ""American Pie"" mentioned several times here seems almost quaint by comparison. Given that the 1999 original worked as a crude-but-endearing corrective to the likes of ""Porkys"" the gently bittersweet tone suffusing this labor-of-love project (Biggs and Scott exec produced) is neither inappropriate nor unwelcome. There are modest delights to be had in ""American Reunion"" not least the sight of these still-winning but no longer fresh-faced actors many of whom have been absent from the bigscreen for lengthy stretches gamely returning for duty. From moment to moment its easy enough to tune out the forgettable plot turns and simply groove on the soundtracks numerous 90s soft-rock touchstones like the Verve Pipes ""The Freshmen"" and Supersonics ""Closing Time"" which prove immediately transporting. But these are glancing incidental pleasures and theyre almost completely divorced from a repetitive overworked screenplay that proves rather less mature and evolved than its characters. With the singular exception of Stifler these blandly likable guys are thinking adults who have long since realized life isnt a teen sex comedy something the pic itself sometimes acknowledges when its not piling on gags involving public defecation and fetish gear. As always the perpetually horny but dependably virtuous Jim must be subjected to all manner of strained humiliations this time involving a nubile girl-next-door (Ali Cobrin) he used to babysit. In accordance with recent lowbrow-comedy trends Biggs after years of consistently dropping his drawers goes fearlessly full-frontal in a scene that will likely provide a major selling point. On a duller note the relational complications between Kevin and Vicky Oz and Heather and Finch and band-nerd-turned-hottie Selena (Dania Ramirez) play out at snooze-inducing length during the reunion-night climax. Indeed at 112 minutes ""Reunion"" is easily the series longest entry largely because it feels the need to cross-reference and embellish anything even remotely memorable from the prior three films. Scenes with Eugene Levy as Jims lovably squirm-inducing dad or Jennifer Coolidge as Stiflers randy mom represent time well spent; a shot of some guys repeatedly screaming ""MILF"" on a football field not so much. Helmers Hurwitz and Schlossberg dont impose much personal stamp on the proceedings apart from making a few ""Harold amp; Kumar"" in-jokes mainly by giving John Cho a few more lines and reaction shots this time around. Despite the pics ""Save the best piece for last"" tagline the ending does not dismiss the possibility of future sequels.

TWITTER Jason Biggs Sean William Scott and Chris Klein lead the first complete gathering of the old gang since 2001s ""American Pie 2."" Can eight movies really have sprung from the lewd meeting of a horny teenager and a fresh-baked desert? The unthinkable is true in American Reunion the first complete gathering of the American Pie gang since 2001s American Pie 2. Assuming producers havent completely killed the brand with four straight-to-vid spinoffs and that some nostalgia for the original exists the good-natured pic should please those fans who havent quite outgrown the pairing of body-fluid gags with dewy-eyed romantic sentiment. That formula remains firmly in place despite the recruitment of writing-directing team Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg whose Harold amp; Kumar films mightve suggested a more psychedelic bent. The title really says it all Having individually decided that the 13th class reunion is the one to attend the Class of 99 reconvenes to find that grown-up compromises notwithstanding everything their hearts knew in high school turned out to be true. PHOTOS American Reunion Premiere Arrivals The movie devotes much energy to submitting Jason Biggs Jim to the same kind of over-the-top humiliation he suffered in chapter one. But being pantsless in the kitchen isnt quite as endearing for a thirtysomething dad and kicking the joke up a notch with frontal nudity -- updating it for the Apatow age -- just emphasizes how old this franchise is. The script finds a more appropriate hazard in Jims neighbor Kara (Ali Cobrin) who is now turning 18 and has a crush on her old babysitter. Through Kara Jim and his pals encounter high school girls who never knew a world without online porn; their lack of inhibition makes the young men feel old while a more aggressive breed of teen dudes further challenges their manliness. The wild card in all this remains Seann William Scotts Steve Stifler the rampaging id whose indignation at his peers maturity provides most of the films real laughs. While his co-stars work to incorporate a decades worth of grown-up backstory into their characters without altering the group dynamic (Chris Klein is most successful here selling some terribly contrived plot points with dopily lovable sincerity) Scott careens through the film confident that its impossible to take things too far. Predictably Eugene Levy steals scenes as Jims now-widowed dad whose re-entry into the dating world puts a nice spin on the originals father-son sex talks. Jims mother (Molly Cheek) is the only major character who doesnt reappear -- some in a line of cameos that feel increasingly forced as we near the end.

Shortly into the running time our now-married hero Jim (Biggs) fondles an old magazine that warns of Y2K; jokes about Chumbawamba and Terminator 2 Judgment Day only partially detonate; and the whole enterprise lurches bizarrely toward sentimental self-pity. Arent we supposed to be getting intimate with pastries already? American Reunion is unavoidably about aging and decay (thats not a veiled reference to Tara Reid); as a decade-since-high-school romp the movie was always going to serve as a reminder of lost youth. Call it a strange and unintended benefit then that many of these generic characters work better as awkward adults than as teens. Seann William Scotts obnoxious Stifler now plays--entertainingly--as a desperate denier squirming as hes hugged by his old lacrosse bros. (""I thought they were wrestling"" says Stifler of the proudly out couple through tears.) Subplots involving cooled passions and the ""mouth that got away"" are tired; better is the films savage portrayal of the younger generation as sex-and-drug-crazed banshees who have never heard of pants. Last months nihilistic Project X is a far more revealing document; American Reunion meanwhile is for an audience that wants to turn its trash into treasure. Like a 90s-era Baby Bottle Pop its way too sweet but might be confused for mothers milk.

Now Titanic has bobbed to the surface yet again in a 3-D re-release making a play for an audience that its original viewers baby-sat.Rewatching the affair between Kate Winslets rebellious haute-monde refugee Rose and Leonardo DiCaprios free-spirited steerage passenger Jack (as in London) its hard to find a line that might resonate across generations like a ""Frankly my dear I dont give a damn."" But the power of Titanic didnt come from originality; it came from punching cliches across with a seldom-seen directness and sincerity that seemed pure of heart ""old-fashioned"" or plain corny depending on your perspective.""Lifes a gift"" Jack says in a typical homily. ""You never know what hand youre gonna get dealt next."" The people who release movies however like to stack the deck. The ostensible reason for the re-release of Camerons Titanic is the centennial of the RMS Titanics abridged voyage. The real reason is that some studio panjandrums have decided that now is the moment in the green-lighting circle of life that this franchise is ready to be taken out of mothballs and relaunched for the key teen-to-35 demographic ideally appealing to one end of that spread through novelty the other through nostalgia.Once a very real 200 million gamble Titanics sequel-resistant story offered the particular combination of technophilia and technophobia that Cameron now tweeting from the ocean floor adores as author of movies (The Terminators Avatar) that warn against the hubris of technological arrogance through vanguard special effects.But CGI spectacle doesnt age gracefully not even with a 3-D facelift. Today Titanic must float or sink on the enduring charisma of its young stars. Winslets Rose flipping an anachronistic bird at the patriarchy suffers from the ""feminist"" pandering of Camerons script which seems today even more over-deliberate in a pop culture glutted with matter-of-fact warrior-women. What is most remarkable viewed with the hindsight of nearly 15 interceding years is the sight of DiCaprio famous bangs bounding as he runs through the ships endless corridors flashing a sharp little triangle of a mouth and actually smiling. It was Titanic that properly launched ""Leo-Mania"" which the actor would spend his subsequent career distancing himself from finding torturous roles to seam his baby face with worry lines making the leap from matinee idol to Our Serious Actor. DiCaprio has been unusually successful in this aim but rewatching Titanic you wish that his growing gravitas had not completely smothered his ability wonderfully evident here to convey simple joy.The French New Wave director Jacques Rivette analyzed the Titanic phenomenon incisively when it first blew up. Citing Winslet as a placeholder for ""inhibited slightly plump American girls who see the film over and over as if they were on a pilgrimage"" Rivette concluded that ""they recognize themselves in her and dream of falling into the arms of the gorgeous Leonardo."" Taking a less weightist view of things Titanic also offered an immersion in the classical romantic Hollywood cinema--yearning worshipful close-ups; a transporting score; seismic sentiments--to a multiplex-bred generation that had little familiarity with this idiom and the experience was intoxicating.Will a contemporary 16-year-old be able to swoon quite the same way for Leo knowing that Jack has become the burly and brooding DiCaprio of latter years caked with old-age makeup in J. Edgar as Robert Pattinson stays eternally young? As for the viewer like myself who saw Titanic as a teenager on the first go-round it is certainly a difficult movie to grow up with for it has so little use for adulthood. As Kurt Vonnegut noted of A Farewell to Arms Titanic elides all of the messy stuff of marriage nipping off the bloom of Rose and Jacks affair while it is still young and perfect--before wilting Rose actually feels the bite of poverty or catches syphilis from one of Jacks Montmartre models. The tragedy of their doomed romance is then a Happily Ever After in disguise.Another defining coming-of-age love story of the Clinton era 1999s American Pie has expanded into a saga far more epic--and rather more adult and complex--than Titanic. American Reunion will be the fourth installment of the Pie series not counting the straight-to-DVD spin-offs which continued the race-to-the-bottom stakes of gross-out comedy.American Pie adapted the teen-sex farce a la Porkys to the enormously successful admixture of shame-based bodily-function-and-dysfunction humor and sentimentality exemplified by 1998s Theres Something About Mary. A motley patchwork of high school stereotypes who were for some strange reason friends--catastrophe-prone putz Jim (Jason Biggs) sweet stud Oz (Chris Klein) and keg-party satyr Stifler (Seann William Scott)--fought a losing frequently embarrassing battle with their hormones.Sequels followed the East Great Falls High kids to college (American Pie 2) and into training-wheels adulthood (American Wedding). This latest episode handled by the Harold amp; Kumar writer-director team of Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg brings together the full original cast at the 13-year EGFH reunion as the anticlimactic disappointments of the thirties have begun to sink in. Jims sex life with onetime band-camp nymphomaniac Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) has gone dry since having kids; B-list talking-head celebrity Oz is mismatched with a party girl a mistake that becomes glaring when confronted with old flame Heather (Mena Suvari); Stifler is in white-collar clip-on-tie purgatory still pining to party like its 1999.As in any reunion the idea is to recapture a bygone feeling that is to echo the Pie films that came before. Jim will engage in awkward birds-and-bees chat with his father (Eugene Levy) and be summarily subjected to public humiliation. Stifler will stay on the shots-and-tits hamster wheel acting exactly like Stifler. Basic truths about sex and intimacy will be rediscovered and reinforced. Boobs will make an appearance. The character of Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) will continue to be dead weight.After some strained ""Remember the time . . ."" callbacks to 13-year-old gags American Reunion gets comfortable and funny as Hurwitz and Schlossberg hit familiar marks from unexpected angles while the ensemble interplay is ""routine"" in the best sense of the word. Taken altogether the Pie movies offer a cohesive worldview showing each of lifes stages as the setting for fresh-yet-familiar catastrophes relieved by a belief in sex however ridiculous it might look as a restorative force. The recipe is so durable and the sustained character work so second-skin by now one can imagine the Pie films keeping with the dramatis personae through middle age and into the problems of geriatric love a raunch-comic version of Britains documentary Up series.
