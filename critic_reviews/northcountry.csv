Which is presumably why New Zealander Caros (Whale Rider) first Hollywood film is only inspired by Jenson vs Evelenth Taconite Co the first class-action sexual harassment case - a convoluted crowded affair that lasted from 1975 to 1998. The movie covers the inaugural details dramatically and plausibly. Single mom-of-two Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron slumming it again if not quite in her Monster make-up this time) joins a small clutch of women including feisty Frances McDormand (sounding Fargo-like) working in the unremittingly misogynist environment of a Minnesotan iron-ore mine. They suffer shocking abuses from their troglodyte colleagues theyre groped and attacked on a daily basis and find dildos in their lunch boxes shit-smeared insults on their walls and cum on their clothes. Aimes complains but it only serves to alienate her from her female co-workers and family especially her miner father and stroppy teenage son. So its off solo to the courtroom to sort things out which is where the film breaks down. Theres a textbook shout-off between lawyer Woody Harrelson and a key witness but more gobsmackingly ruinous is a revelation about Aimes sexual history that turns the whole case. Add a muddled timescale - her kids barely age a day so exactly how truncated are the 23-year-long events? - and your faith in this retelling of a US legal watershed starts to wane.

"In North Country A Deep Vein Of Outrage washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On In North Country A Deep Vein Of Outrage Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 21 2005 ""North Country"" opens with a scene of Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron) escaping a violent marriage with two kids in tow. As she packs them into an old pickup truck she could be the blue-collar twin of Mary Tyler Moores career girl setting off down a wintry Minnesota road toward an uncertain future. And like the spunky Mary Richards of the iconic sitcom Josey becomes a sort of unwitting feminist symbol here as the first woman to file a sexual harassment lawsuit in the United States. As the fictionalized version of that landmark event ""North Country"" is an engrossing well-crafted story of a grave injustice avenged hitting all the right notes of sympathy outrage and finally relief. Based on a real-life 1984 case in which Lois Jenson sued her employer a Minnesota mining company ""North Country"" picks up the story of Josey as she arrives on her parents doorstep in Minnesotas bleak Mesabi Iron Range. At the encouragement of a friend named Glory (Frances McDormand) Josey gets a well-paid job at one of the mines which have only recently begun to hire women. Despised by their male colleagues the women are routinely groped and verbally abused culminating in Joseys case in a near-rape on a pile of taconite. ""A sense of humor ladies"" one co-worker intones. ""Rule numero uno ."" A sense of humor for example about discovering a sex toy in your lunchbox or seeing all manner of organic substances smeared across your locker or clothing. ""North Country"" is too grim too harrowing too nobly aggrieved to be described as a fun night at the movies. But as an example of what used to be described as a ""social problem"" picture it holds its own with such classics as ""Norma Rae"" ""The Accused"" and ""Erin Brockovich."" Like those films ""North Country"" does a good job in ratcheting up the tension and unfairness until the audience is brought to the breaking point along with the long-suffering Josey who takes so many hits -- to her body her psyche and her reputation -- that she begins to resemble a feminist Saint Sebastian. (Joseys sexual past including a teenage pregnancy is viciously invoked to punish her for fighting back.) Theron who won an Oscar last year for completely transforming herself to play the prostitute Aileen Wuornos once again proves to be a remarkable character actress submerging her almost superhuman beauty to become a typical blond pretty Minnesota girl. (Shes also mastered the accent which is just south of ""Fargo."") Although ""North Country"" is framed by Joseys emerging consciousness and eleventh-hour courtroom saves the real drama of the movie is found in director Niki Caros observant even elegant depiction of the unspoken tribal codes that hold an insular community together and the severe price of transgressing them. (Its the same talent she brought to her debut film ""Whale Rider."") The complexity of the story lies not with the piggish men and their brothers who serve as silent witnesses but with Joseys female co-workers none of whom at first supports her fight. Glory the only female union representative at the plant embodies a particular type the ""one of the boys"" whose go-along-to-get-along tactics teeter precariously between survival and collaboration. Its that ambiguity that Caro and screenwriter Michael Seitzman (working from a 2003 book by Washington authors Clara Bingham and Laura Leedy Gansler) have captured with economy and precision. Whats more the filmmakers let pictures and sound tell an otherwise didactic story with panoramic shots of denuded hills and belching steam pipes suggesting the enormity of what Josey is facing as well as a soundtrack dominated by the Iron Ranges most famous son Bob Dylan. As Josey sets off down the highway to the strains of ""Sweetheart Like You"" the audience is left with an ending that while not hat-in-the-air happy suggests that shes going to make it after all. North Country (130 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity and for disturbing sequences involving sexual harassment including violence and dialogue.

FRANCES McDORMAND also stars. Photo - Image 2 of 2 Charlize Theron and Frances MacDormand in ""North Country"" Ran on 10-16-2005 Charlize Theron and Frances MacDormand in ""North Country"" Ran on 10-16-2005 Photo Handout One stunning miner manages to extract emotion from a dismal situation 1 / 2 Back to Gallery North Country Drama. Starring Charlize Theron Frances McDormand Woody Harrelson Sissy Spacek and Richard Jenkins. Directed by Niki Caro. (R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Flush with her biggest paycheck ever single mom Josey Aimes -- who rises to heroine status in ""North Country"" much like Erin Brockovich in the movie named for her -- splurges on a restaurant meal. The kick Josey obviously gets from treating her two kids is enhanced when the owner of the mine where shes started working stops by to introduce himself telling her ""I remember your face."" Well thats understandable. Such an exquisite face its every feature nearly perfect would stand out even encased in soot from the quarries. Charlize Therons beauty initially makes her not terribly believable as a woman forced to blast ore and haul rocks for a living. But Therons performance gains both credibility and force as Joseys looks turn out to be germane in this compelling if occasionally unnecessarily convoluted movie. Loosely based on a true incident ""North Country"" is set in 1989 in a small northern Minnesota town dependent on its mines for employment. When a small number of women are hired the male miners feel threatened and make things extremely unpleasant for their new co-workers. For Josey who has a history of attracting men with bad intentions this means unwanted sexual advances bordering on rape. With Anita Hill as an inspiration -- the family television is turned to her testimony at Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings -- Josey spearheads a sexual harassment class-action suit against the mining company. Related Stories North Country Thats a lot of story to tell and it takes a while for director Niki Caro to find a way into it. The New Zealand filmmaker was hired based on her success with ""Whale Rider"" a minuscule undertaking compared with this one. Caro was handed a cast of heavy-hitters including Oscar winners Theron Sissy Spacek as Joseys wise mother and Frances McDormand as a veteran of the mines. The first 15 minutes or so of ""North Country"" are a mess. Caro attempts the same technique Fernando Meirelles used in ""The Constant Gardener"" of switching back and forth in time. But she lacks his prescience in being able to tell how much the audience can process before becoming terminally baffled. So we get a close-up of a badly bruised Josey victimized by a wife-beater followed by shots of her as a voluptuous teen. One moment Josey is being examined by the mining companys doctor to make sure she isnt pregnant; the next shes testifying in court about the indignity of the procedure. Fortunately ""North Country"" calms down and becomes extremely engrossing especially in the courtroom battles where Josey discovers her strength. Legal professionals might scoff that the proceedings are allowed to become so raucous. But its all carefully calculated for dramatic effect and succeeds brilliantly in drawing you in and eliciting tears in the process. Theron fast becoming one of the best actresses of her generation exhibits impressive range in a scene where Josey insists on addressing union members vehemently opposed to her lawsuit. Boiling with anger she stares down the crowd and her silence speaks volumes. Oddly in a movie about womens rights the other actresses arent given much to do. Spaceks role is seriously underwritten and McDormands character disappears for long stretches. The men fare far better. Woody Harrelson is at his jaunty best as a onetime hockey star still fantasizing about his past glory. He returns to his hometown from New York where he practiced law just in time to let Josey talk him into representing her. Harrelson gets to deliver the films few stabs at humor as when he rejects a hot young things invitation to dance by informing her ""Im wearing underwear older than you."" Richard Jenkins gives the standout supporting performance worthy of Oscar consideration as Joseys father a miner unable to conceal his anger at his daughter for having a child out of wedlock and now creating dissension at his workplace. Among the most difficult acting assignments is to show confusion -- its what makes Hamlet such a bear. Jenkins an unsung character actor best known as the dad on ""Six Feet Under"" who returns from the dead delves into the heart of a man trying to do the right thing -- if only he can figure out what it is. ""North Country"" would have benefited from crisper editing. It runs at least 15 minutes longer than necessary. How many overview shots of the mines do we need before getting the idea that theyre dismal? For all its flaws ""North Country"" delivers an emotional wallop and a couple of performances worthy of recognition come award time. -- Advisory This film contains violent scenes some of a sexual nature and strong language.

Theres nothing inviting about this landscape just as theres nothing welcoming about the iron mine where Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron) a single mother newly returned to her hometown gets a new job. Shes one of very few women to work there and the men make no secret of their contempt for these interlopers. ""Gotta get a gator skin on"" says Joseys friend Glory (Frances McDormand). But Josey whos just fled an abusive marriage wont silently tolerate humiliation. Shes taken this job to raise herself in the world -- earning a previously unthinkable salary -- and she wont give it up easily. Therons Josey has a flat voice and a tough no-nonsense expression that cracks only a few times tellingly. After she gets the job she takes her children out for a meal in a no-frills diner. ""Its our first time in a nice restaurant"" she tells them and her voice trembles just a bit Shes glimpsing a different life for her family and shell walk through hell to get it. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""North Country"" with Charlize Theron Frances McDormand Sean Bean Richard Jenkins Woody Harrelson Sissy Spacek. Directed by Niki Caro from a screenplay by Michael Seitzman inspired by the book ""Class Action The Landmark Case that Changed Sexual Harassment Law"" by Clara Bingham and Laura Leedy Gansler. 126 minutes. Rated R for sequences involving sexual harassment including violence and dialogue and for language. Several theaters. And hell is what that workplace becomes for Josey as comments and innuendo escalate into physical violence and a climate of fear. Except for the laconic Glory Josey stands alone The other female employees an appealing group of raunchy women with raucous laughs (look among them for former Seattleite Jillian Armenante) dont want to make trouble. When Josey and her lawyer (Woody Harrelson) form a class-action lawsuit for sexual harassment -- the nations first -- no one else will join her. Caro whose last film was the beautiful coming-of-age tale ""Whale Rider"" falters a bit in her first big-studio outing. ""North Country"" is too often melodramatic with a major characters illness a few too many last-minute transformations (including a courtroom scene that weve seen before) and a soundtrack filled with inspirational-movie cliches. But shes got a good story to tell (based loosely on a real-life case) and a marvelous cast to help her tell it. Richard Jenkins as Joseys miner father finds a gentleness buried deep within his character; likewise Sissy Spacek as Joseys mother gives her role unexpected steel. McDormand brings her welcome dryness to a role that could easily have become syrupy. And Theron proves that all the accolades she received for ""Monster"" werent a fluke. Shes a character actress hiding behind movie-star cheekbones and here she movingly creates a brave smart woman who transforms fear into action -- and transforms her life.

"Theron fares well up yonder but movie dad runs the country - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Harassment Theron fares well up yonder but movie dad runs the countrymovies - reviewOctober 21 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticThe Iron Range of northern Minnesota is a barren tundra a snowscape gouged by gaping wounds in the land open pit mines worked by men as hard as their surroundings.Its conservative polka-listening hockey-playing country. And its a very strange place to set a national precedent for sexual-harassment law. But thats just what happened there in the 1980s.Lois Jensen had a job where she wasnt wanted. The good ol boys who worked with her had ways of letting her know that. When she had had enough she went to court and changed the American workplace forever.North Country is a Norma Rae-styled fictional version of that true story a harrowing and depressing but in the end uplifting account of someone who needed a job so badly she was willing to endure things one cant describe in a family newspaper just to work alongside people who wished her dead.Charlize Theron finally cashes in some of that Monster-Oscar capital as Josey Aimes. Shes a single mom with a colorful sexual history and an abusive relationship shes fleeing when we meet her. She has just brought her two kids back home to the range where she grew up.But her hopes of getting on her feet and making a life for them are dashed by the lack of opportunity there. Only her friend Glory (Frances McDormand) seems to be able to make it and shes a miner. Only the mine the big local employer pays enough to finance their version of the American Dream.Joseys dad played by veteran character actor Richard Jenkins is a manager who doesnt want to see her in the mine ""taking jobs"" away from men. Her mom (Sissy Spacek) tries to mediate the growing rift between them.And Josey needs her dad. The men in the mine are barely worthy of being called ""men."" They harass taunt and assault the few women there.""Work hard keep your mouth shut and take it like a man"" the women are told. And they do.But the guys push Josey too far farther than you can imagine. When Josey tries to fight the company the harassers and the culture that protects them she finds out just how few friends she has. Glory is little help. Her female colleagues are scared into silence. Her own family wont stick up for her. Shes left with only a struggling lawyer (Woody Harrelson) at her side.Niki Caro director of Whale Rider has made a classic underdog-vs.-the-system story rendered in the harsh blue-grays of a Minnesota winter. The only visual relief from the films hellish mine and drab colorless houses is its brown courtroom. Everything about the film even the tunes selected for the soundtrack (Bob Dylans ""Girl of the North Country"" is one) reinforce that.Theres lots of melodrama -- Joseys son is furious at her for bringing this down on the family Glory gets sick and her crippled husband (Sean Bean) tries to prop her up.But Theron commits to the part the way she did for Monster letting the dirt blood and fear show. Her Minnesota accent pales next to McDormand but McDormand (Fargo) has had a lot more practice.Harrelson has his first decent part in ages but Spacek is merely stoic and symbolic. Shes barely in the film.The big turn is by Jenkins a bit player with some 60 film and TV-movie appearances behind him. His character has the longest journey to take from intolerance to understanding. And his big moment at a union meeting a place where hes respected and she is loathed is eloquent simple and moving.Yes this is Oscar bait for Theron and shes wonderful in this sort of transformative role. But its Jenkins who is the soul of this piece and of the country that has changed as the laws have changed. And Jenkins is the one who should get a nomination.

FACT BOXNorth Country Starring Charlize Theron Frances McDormand Sissy Spacek Woody Harrelson Directed by Niki Caro Written by Michael Seitzman Studio Warner Bros. YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Sexual Harassment Movies or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- Around this time of year -- like a visit from the flu bug -- Hollywood is bitten by a severe case of B.O.B ""Blatant Oscar Bid."" ""North Country"" is one of this years first full-blown cases.Three Oscar winners are in the cast just to help make the point. Charlize Theron stars as Josey Aimes a poverty-ridden single mother escaping an abusive relationship who becomes an unlikely activist against a male dominated mining company.Sissy Spacek plays her emotionally conflicted mother and Frances McDormand gives a great turn as her friend Glory another female miner who is responsible for helping Josey get her job in the first place.Attempting to follow in the steps of ""Silkwood"" Norma Rae"" and ""Erin Brockovich"" ""North Country"" carries its importance like a tattered flag. It never lets you forget that this is a meaningful film about an important subject.This movie -- very very very loosely based on a true story -- tells the tale of a group women of who broke the status quo by working as iron miners in the remote male-dominated world of northern Minnesotas Iron Range.The movie is framed by scenes in a courtroom as Josey brings a class action suit against the mine for sexual harassment. The story then returns to the courtroom throughout the film in order to underscore what is happening at the mine.HarassmentIts the 1980s and Josey her young daughter and adolescent son have fled from her abusive husband. They end up at her parents house in the town where she grew up.Her father played by Richard Jenkins (""Six Feet Under"") works at the local mine and is less than pleased to see his daughter. Her mother played by Spacek is more supportive.Josey is working a dead-end job in a beauty parlor when shes convinced by Glory -- over her parents strong objections -- to take a job at the local iron mine. The sexual harassment begins immediately ranging from adolescent locker room pranks to attempted rape.Soon Josey seeks out the help of a local man Bill White (Woody Harrelson) a lawyer who has given up practicing law after a successful but unfulfilling career in New York City.He takes her case not because of its merits but for the challenge (and notoriety) It would be the first sexual harassment class action suit in history against a major corporation and would therefore change the course of how women are treated in the workplace.But in order to have a class action suit there must be three complaints and none of the other women -- including Glory -- are willing to rock the boat. They desperately want Josey to go along to get along and therefore leave her hanging out to dry.Now the film degenerates into one overwrought and poorly written scene after another. The harassment increases. The courtroom scenes become longer and longer. The mining companys lawyer -- a single token woman without another attorney in sight for the defense -- constantly reminds the companys CEO that if any one else joins the case all is lost.Finally the movie gets to its dramatic courtroom showdown -- and loses whatever credibility it had. Without revealing too much a sudden left-field revelation changes the entire case and the once-alone Josey now has a cheering section. The turn of events is so patently false and trite I wanted to throw my notebook at the screen. Even Frank Capra would have been embarrassed.Yes the acting is excellent (despite Michael Seitzmans cliched dialogue) and Niki Caros direction straightforwardly captures the bleakness of the living and working conditions suffered by the miners. The talent offered by the film is obvious.But all the talent in the world is no excuse for a movie essentially designed as Oscar bait. If you want to see a fine film about working-class laborers taking on the big boys try ""Norma Rae."" If you want to see good performances and cinematography wasted in a mediocre movie that would be ""North Country.""

It even says a little something about the refuge and sanctity of a neighborhood tavern. Trouble in the iron mines Jeremy Renner and Charlize Theron who goes up against some powerful people. Warner Bros. Pictures Moldy bars at least are in out of the cold and this is a movie in which a frigid locale is important. Based on a landmark sexual-harassment class-action suit Country deals with female workers who take much much worse than sass in a Minnesota iron mine. And when they exit the plant after a terrible day at work what do they see? Snow and their breath. This is Charlize Therons first major big-screen role since winning an Oscar for Monster. And though the actress is again deglamorized this time shes recognizable. About the movie North Country    (out of four) Stars Charlize Theron Frances McDormand Woody Harrelson Sissy Spacek Richard Jenkins Sean Bean Director Niki Caro Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for sequences involving sexual harassment including violence and dialogue and for language Running time 2 hours 6 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Critics might argue that however emotionally invested her performance is Theron is still too pretty to play someone who is ground down by life. Yet looks are an issue in this movie. Is her character sleeping around or coming on to male co-workers who outnumber women in the mine 30-1? No but many locals are trying to discredit her on this level. As in 1983s superior Silkwood Countrys most resonant scenes are work-related oppressed women grousing (but taking it) in the changing room; a lone female union rep (crusty Frances McDormand) trading barbs with ""the boys""; scatological graffiti and we mean literally; a heart-tugger at the union hall when Therons long-estranged father and mine employee (Richard Jenkins) pulls a surprise. But much of the movie deals with Therons rebellious adolescent son. This subplot bogs down the film as does director Niki Caros inability to put a fresh spin on courtroom scenes. And this is despite a smart subtle performance by Linda Emond as the mines defense attorney plus the pleasure of seeing Woody Harrelson in a nice-guy role as Therons lawyer. The finale reduces Country to ""a movie"" which is kind of a rude surprise. Otherwise much of the setup is worthy of Caro who did the memorable Whale Rider another film in which setting is important. The milieu here is unforgiving which makes fighting for basic rights important. You get a sense of why Bob Dylan -- who performs on this soundtrack -- wanted to bolt this frigid part of the map.

"Niki Caros North Country. Slate Sign In Sign Up Niki Caros North Country. Niki Caros North Country. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 20 2005 610 PM Charlize and the Chauvinist Factory North Country a harassment drama from Niki Caro. By David Edelstein Dont ""little lady"" her North Country (Warner Bros.) opens with Charlize Theron as Josey Aimes a housewife and mother getting beaten by her spouse and driving the kids to the home of her parents (Sissy Spacek and Richard Jenkins) who wonder what she did to make her husband so mad--sleep with another guy maybe? It mustve been something. Her dad doesnt take kindly to Josey when in an attempt to be self-sufficient she applies for a job at the local iron-ore mine. The Supreme Court did say women can do anything men can do but the mine aint no place for girls and anyway jobs are scarce enough without females in the workplace. The first thing Josey hears at orientation is a muttered epithet beginning with ""c""; this is however positively collegial compared to having it scrawled in fecal matter on the walls of the womens locker room. The company doctor puts Josey in stirrups and fills the fellas in on the state of her privates. Then comes the innuendo and outright slander the gazes both leering and baleful more ""c"" and ""b"" utterances sexual menacing--and to add insult to injury theres Anita Hill getting grilled by males on TV while her mother tsk-tsks and says think of that poor mans family. Even her son calls her a whore. And then there are the flashbacks to when Josey was a teenager and if you think shes getting sexually harassed now ... In interviews Theron and her director Niki Caro have said that the original screenplay (by Michael Seitzman) was a little too black-and-white and that they tried to introduce ""shades of gray."" I can only infer that said shades are moments when some of the men--after hissing the c-word and pushing over a Port-A-Potty with one of Joseys co-workers (Michelle Monaghan) in it who emerges screaming and sobbing and covered in liquid shit--are shown for a second or two with a look of shame. But those looks are fleeting. There is after all harassment to be done. Advertisement North Country is powerful and then some. I came out shaking dabbing at my eyes and vowing never again to write the c-word in shit on the walls of a womens room. Joseys plight would make Oliver Twist say ""What a rough life."" The template is similar to Caros Whale Rider remote setting; strong-willed female in conflict with an entrenched masculine culture; and much that rests on the (belated) endorsement of a deeply threatened patriarch. But theres no escape--not even a friendly whale on which to hop. Even Joseys fellow harassees wish shed shut up and live with it. The theme isnt just sexism but the changing American economy--the blue-collar towns slowly dying their hangers-on living a dog-eat-dog life with the bitches the first to go. The movie is based on the book Class Action The Landmark Case That Changed Sexual Harassment Law by Clara Bingham and Laura Leedy Gansler. No make that ""inspired by"" meaning nothing happened the way its presented but the authors got a big check for the film rights. And for all my male snark there is much here to inspire women entering the workplace. After all few experiences could be worse than Joseys. Pubic hair on a Coke can--bring it on. Chris Menges cinematography--with its customary emphasis on landscape (stark) the texture of buildings (rust peeling paint) and even the air (or airlessness)--undercuts the melodrama and Caro coaxes exquisitely nuanced performances from her actors. Theron remains a fascinating actress with those soft blue eyes and cheeks and that hard unfussy delivery. She sobs a lot in this picture but the tears never seem forced--they almost erupt from her eyes in spite of her resolve with flashes of anger in their wake. The films most enlivening scenes are between Theron and the even harder Frances McDormand as a co-worker (and union rep) who steadies Josey advises her to develop ""gator skin"" and gives it back to the harassers--although the part calls for her to be weakened by illness as if what men cant do a misogynistic universe can. Just as superb is Spacek soft-spoken with little glasses on a chain around her neck the repressed as agent of repression--but increasingly alert to the schism. There is a marvelous shot of Monaghan tipsily sashaying her way towards a newcomer (Woody Harrelson) in the local watering hole savoring her power in this one arena. (Gently if wryly rebuffed--""I have underwear older than you""--she has no comeback except to call him a homo.) As Joseys timorous suitor and the lawyer who finally takes her case for sexual harassment Harrelson serves up an amusing (if incredible) blend of solicitousness and opportunism sensitivity and (when shredding a witness) machismo. In North Country men do have their uses especially if women can arouse their Superman instincts and let them save the day. You can imagine those men saying ""Im proud of you for your bold empowering feminism little lady.""

She joins a small cadre of women who have been allowed in the mines due to Supreme Court-mandated quotas.Soon the sexual intimidation begins obscenities are scrawled in changing rooms or shouted in public port-a-potties are overturned while the women are inside and much worse. Josie is no standard-bearer - she just wants to make enough money to care for her children - but the relentlessness of the harassment forces her to fight back. For a time shes just about the only one who does. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Critics have been comparing this film to ""Norma Rae"" and ""Silkwood"" but a more apt comparison might be to ""High Noon."" Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The best parts of ""North Country"" are the scenes between the female miners as they banter and let off steam. Director Niki Caro (""Whale Rider"") working from a script by Michael Seitzman has a strong feeling for how women band together - and break apart. Her depiction of these women is far from doctrinaire. Some of them are as hostile to Josies entreaties as any man. And not all the men are ogres. For starters Josies lawyer (Woody Harrelson) is an ex-hockey star turned Sensitive Guy while the company lawyer is a female turncoat.But overall ""North Country"" is too self-consciously scaled as an anthem for the human spirit. We can spot where this movie is headed right from the beginning and not just because Caro employs a tricky time structure that keeps flashing back from the courtroom trial. We know when we first see Josie that she is being primed for sainthood. That smudge of iron dust on her cheek is her red (make that gray) badge of courage. And we know when we meet her upstanding company boss that he will turn out to be a worm just as we know that her disapproving father a lifelong miner or her angry uncomprehending son will eventually rally to her cause. Theres even the obligatory ""I am Spartacus"" sequence where the workers one by one stand up to support their martyr. If it were not for Chris Mengess gravely powerful cinematography which turns the iron mine into a living breathing landscape the movie would seem a lot stagier than it is. (Theres a lot of Hollywood in this neck of the woods.)As a union rep Frances McDormand (who still has her Minnesota vowels in place from ""Fargo"") periodically helps relieve the righteousness although this is the kind of movie where the character with the funniest lines is obliged to acquire a terminal illness. Harrelson does his considerable best to redeem the hackneyed role of the dreamboat do-gooder. No matter how conventional his roles may be he always gives them a feral quality an eccentricity that lifts them out of the ordinary.Theron has her best role since her Oscar-winning Monster which isnt saying much if youve seen some of her intervening efforts like ""Head in the Clouds"" (which prompted some people to call for an Oscar recall vote). Without the prosthetic makeup from ""Monster"" Therons blond prettiness shines forth as usual and Caro plays up the incongruity between the actresss runway model looks and her grimy surroundings. Perhaps she plays it up too much - Josie is transformed almost literally into a beacon of hope. Grade B- Rated R for sequences involving sexual harassment including violence and dialogue and for language.

Penney socks it to the big guys on behalf of working women everywhere. I suspect the reasons for this go beyond the fact that absent Lindsay Lohans name on the marquee only women of a certain age will pay money to see such passe -- and essential -- fare. Class and gender wars are or ought to be as urgent today as they ever were but in public discourse theyre neatly hidden behind those politically paralyzing media-stoked terrors of random weather flu pandemics and terrorism. Good on Warner Bros. then for backing Niki Caros North Country though I doubt whether this fact-based yarn about a Minnesota miner who slaps a sexual-harassment suit on her corporate employer would ever have gotten off the ground without Charlize Theron attached. Sophisticates will sniff at North Country. Inspired by a book by Clara Bingham and Laura Leedy Gansler about a landmark 1980s class-action lawsuit the movie is a slice of prime-cut populist theatrics and none the worse for being headlined by Theron even if she looks about as much like a Minnesota iron miner as I look like Charlize Theron. Short of the several pounds of makeup and serial-killer scowl she labored under for Monster theres no tamping down Therons radiant alabaster beauty or her physical grace. But for someone accustomed to kicking up her shapely heels for the Joffrey Ballet or swaying down a runway in Prada Theron looks pretty damn persuasive in flannel shirts a hardhat and liberal facial bruising (courtesy of a former husband who cant keep his fists to himself). Like many a female Oscar winner Theron seems to have gotten better offers from perfume companies than from film studios since winning the Best Actress Oscar for Monster but along with Julia Roberts when cast in the right role shes one of the most earthy forthright actresses working today. Which makes her a canny choice to play Josey Aimes a single parent with a checkered romantic history who nevertheless works up the guts to take on male-dominated unions and a giant corporation.Given the trowel with which Caro and screenwriter Michael Seitzman pile on the grief for Josey Im guessing that her trials have been liberally fictionalized though theyre hardly implausible. In addition to her own shaky self-esteem and a shop floor full of threatened men who find it amusing to write ""Cunt"" on the bathroom walls in their own feces or slip rubber penises into lunch pails Josey must contend with a stubbornly unsupportive father (the always dependable Richard Jenkins) a painfully submissive mother (Sissy Spacek) a teenage son (Thomas Curtis) whos furious at her for attracting negative attention and perhaps worst of all her fellow woman workers among them her friend Glory (played by Frances McDormand who in another kind of movie business would have been cast as Josey) who fear that Joseys activism will cost them the queasy status quo theyve carved out for themselves rubber dicks and all.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Caro who made the handsomely mounted Whale Rider was smart enough to hire legendary cinematographer Chris Menges whose naturalistic lighting brings an aching majestic beauty to the frozen Northern Minnesota backdrop. Still theres a TV-movie stiffness to North Country which is conventionally structured by a courtroom drama that frames flashbacks to Joseys early life and her struggles with a former boyfriend (Jeremy Renner) who singles her out for particularly vicious reprisal. The temper of the times with its virulent antifeminist backlash is glaringly (if fittingly) flagged by television footage of Anita Hills testimony against Clarence Thomas.North Country is more Norma Rae than Erin Brockovich You cant imagine Caro evoking the sheer giddy fun of political combat the way Steven Soderbergh does although Woody Harrelson is mischievously cast against type as Joseys hesitant has-been of a lawyer while Sean Bean moves out of villain mode to give a quietly impressive performance as Glorys supportive husband. But North Country isnt reductive either; it doesnt divide neatly into beastly men and intrepid woman warriors and Theron invests Joseys growth from a downtrodden loser into a fighter with a delicate vulnerability; you understand theres as much at stake in her fight with herself and her family as there is in her institutional battles. Without having read the book on which North Country is based I find it difficult to believe that such an epic victory was won by one woman alone. Yet the movies old-school feminism is true to its subject and Theron proves charismatic enough to stand alone as an emblematic working-class heroine doing what she has to do without benefit of feminist theory. Im even willing to forgive this rousing drama its coy flirty ending if only because its heroine has the grace not to drive her pickup truck off a cliff.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (NORTH COUNTRY Richard Foreman) B North Country Genre Drama; Starring Frances McDormand Charlize Theron Woody Harrelson Jeremy Renner Sissy Spacek; Director Niki Caro; Author Michael Seitzman; Release Date Limited 10/21/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 123; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted October 19 2005 -- 1200 AM EDT In the freedom-fighting movie culture of the 1970s populist muckrakers like Norma Rae The China Syndrome and All the Presidents Men drew us into the everyday urgency of injustice. They ignited passions because they connected to the zeitgeist and audiences felt the relevance of those films in their guts hearts and bones. Im not sure if theyll feel that same kick of relevance during North Country a grimly earnest sexual harassment rabble-rouser that begins in 1989 even though the landmark case its based on is rooted in events that started in the mid-70s. The films spirit of outrage is genuine but also more than a bit secondhand. At the beginning Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron) rangy and sharp-boned with a semi-shag haircut that hangs like a half-lowered curtain over her serious pretty features grabs her kids and flees her abusive husband returning to her hometown in the wintry desolation of northern Minnesota. Its a stern devout community where high school hockey is a religion and people speak in a charmingly eccentric pidgin-ethnic twang and where everyone more or less works at the same place the local iron mines a hellhole of smelting danger. Unskilled and in dire need of cash Josey encouraged by her old friend a union rep named Glory Dodge (Frances McDormand doing a variation on her chipper moonstruck den-mother act from Fargo) goes to work at the mines. Shes prepared to face the grueling conditions the acrid smells the splatters of iron ore. What she isnt as ready for is her male co-workers who see the women miners -- at this point a tiny minority -- as feminist interlopers who have no right to be taking their jobs. The mens fury is couched in their belief that hard labor wasnt meant to be womens work. Even Joseys father (Richard Jenkins) a lifelong miner views her as an invader. North Country packs a solid familiar punch. An orientation supervisor addresses the women miners with smug derision and a sex toy gets planted in one of their lunch boxes. One of Joseys bosses a former high school flame (Jeremy Renner) assumes he can treat her as his personal concubine; he makes lecherous comments then a slobby pass then worse. Directing her first Hollywood feature Niki Caro the New Zealand filmmaker who debuted with the righteous if gauzy girl-power fairy tale Whale Rider stages all of this with grimly sinister matter-of-fact skill like something out of a prison film in which the new inmates are ritually hazed and abused. At one point the women find obscene messages smeared onto the walls with excrement. When Josey meets with the president of the mining company to protest this pattern of abuse the meeting is a sham -- a cover-up spiked with threats. Trapped by a conspiracy of male rage Josey teaming up with a courtly lawyer (Woody Harrelson) strikes back against the mine by initiating the first class-action sexual harassment suit in U.S. history. Compared to say Erin Brockovich North Country takes more than its share of factual liberties. The transposing of eras results in a kind of sociological fuzziness and Josey herself is a composite character complete with a lurid backstory of victimization. I wouldnt mind the fictionalization though if the film had made her a more vivid personality. Theron plays Josey with an honorable slow-burn weariness as if fed up with the effect she has on men but its a performance of workaday nobility one thats a shade too anonymous to be exciting. The limitation of North Country isnt that it overhypes the evil that men do. Its that the film as sincere and watchable as it is never succeeds in portraying Josey and her struggle as more than a hermetic tale of injustice. At key points we see images of Anita Hills testimony at the Clarence Thomas hearings. That watershed event helps to inspire Joseys crusade but the audience may well have less of a clear-cut reaction to those clips. In a weird way North Country is the right movie at the wrong time. It mythologizes the struggle of women to do the most dangerous rough-and-tumble jobs imaginable just at the moment when a counterrevolution is taking place as more and more women reconsider whether to sacrifice the workplace in favor of home. Caro touches on the ambivalence of the other female miners toward Josey but North Country might have been richer tougher more honestly liberal if it had revealed a few more shades of gray among the men -- perhaps daring to show for instance that at least a few of those fighting to keep women out of the mines could have had chivalrous motives a belief system rooted in the urge to protect. Nothing though ever gets in the way of the movies advertisement for valor. 2006 Oscar Nominations Best Actress (Charlize Theron); Best Supporting Actress (Frances McDormand) Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories Fast and Furious 8 Dwayne Johnson dives for cover in new set video Kanye West on Apples talks with Tidal Let the kids have the music A Chorus Line kicks up the classics at the Hollywood Bowl Sarah Jessica Parker New HBO show isnt Sex and the City The Larry Sanders Show reruns returning to HBO this fall Stranger Things cast and fans scared with even Stranger prank HBO chief spars with critics over rape scenes Photo Galleries 50Scoops50Days The Latest in Fall TV News The Biggest Moments From the 2016 Conventions Crazy Stupid Love Before They Were Stars The Most 2000s Fashion From John Tucker Must Die Exclusive Photos of The Walking Dead Season 7 27 Great Revenge Movies Alice in Wonderland Witticisms and Wisdom From the Disney Classic From Our Partners From Our Partners Contact UsCustomer ServiceAbout UsJobs at Time Inc.AdvertisePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAd ChoicesNewslettersSubscribeTerms of ServiceSite Map Copyright (c) 2016 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

"North Country | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; north-country ) North Country (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli In the tradition of Norma Rae and Silkwood North Country is the story of one womans struggle against an inflexible corporation. Despite some third-act flaws that weaken the conclusion North Country does what it sets out to do inspire and uplift. It also provides a stark reminder of the inequities faced by women as they attempted (and continue to attempt) to achieve equal footing with their male counterparts in the workforce. 1989 (the year in which the bulk of the film transpires) isnt that long ago. Many things have changed since then; sadly the cultural shift has not penetrated into the darkest recesses of some areas of employment. North Country states that it is ""inspired by true events."" ""Inspired"" is probably as good as any description since the films relationship to the real world is thin. Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron) is a fictionalized version of Lois Jensen. While some of the facts of the case and the general setting mirror those of the historical account most of what ended up in Michael Seitzmans screenplay is fictional. I have no problem with that - it makes for a better story - but this is a cautionary note to those who believe they are watching a docu-drama. (I really wish movie studios would cease-and-desist with ""based on true story"" captions - they do nothing to strengthen the narrative and often spark debates about the ""accuracy"" of the screenplay when thats usually a red herring.) Its 1989 in the North Country of Northern Minnesota where iron mining represents the lifeblood of many communities. Fleeing an abusive relationship Josey Aimes (Charlize Theron) returns to her childhood community with her two kids Sammy (Thomas Curtis) and Karen (Elle Peterson) in tow. Her mother Alice (Sissy Spacek) is delighted to see her but her father Hank (Richard Jenkins) is not about to kill the fatted calf. After spending some time scraping together a few dollars working at a local hair salon Josey is persuaded by her friend Glory (Frances McDormand) to apply at the iron mine. Although the ratio of men-to-women is 301 and the men are at times openly hostile to their female co-workers (they believe the women are ""taking away"" mens jobs) the pay is six times better than what Josey can make styling hair. The conditions Josey encounters are beyond what she is capable of quietly bearing (although that is the advice she gets from more than one corner). She takes charges of harassment to her boss and is told to return when she has a real problem. The company CEO tells her to resign advice which she eventually takes but only after hiring a lawyer Bill White (Woody Harrelson). Bills idea is to pursue the first class action lawsuit for sexual harassment. But will any of the other women working at the mine stand alongside Josey? On a dramatic level North Country works for most of its running length. Joseys story is compelling. Shes the classic underdog fighting against the implacable corporation. Shes on the side of right and the forces of evil are aligned against her. Bolstered by a solid performance from Academy Award winner Charlize Theron Josey is a three-dimensional woman - a single mother fighting to provide for her children and a daughter trying to earn her fathers approval. To the extent that we have all been underdogs at one time or another in the workplace we identify with Josey. Director Niki Caro (Whale Rider) does not attempt an evenhanded portrayal of events. The story is presented unapologetically from Joseys vantage point. The mining company and the men are the bad guys. (Not all of the men of course but a sizeable percentage of them.) Some of the things they do to Josey and her friend Shelly (Michelle Monaghan) are reprehensible. One of the most effective and touching aspects of the story is the way Joseys father Hank finds himself caught in the middle - and eventually must choose sides. His emotional speech in front of a union meeting is one of North Countrys high points both emotionally and dramatically. There are weaknesses. A key scene late in the movie between Sammy and Glorys husband Kyle (Sean Bean) doesnt ring true. I didnt believe anything in this scene; every action and line of dialogue is contrived. The court proceedings - to the extent that we see them - are generic and unsatisfying. And of course we have the Big Dramatic Moment in which the tide turns. The last scene is odd with the court case left unresolved (a closing caption tells us what happened). Instead we get a ""domestic"" moment that would have worked better if it hadnt been used to close the film. Its as if someone recognized that the running time was north of two hours and the proceedings had to be stopped immediately before viewers became restless. Solid acting abounds but one would expect no less with a cast of this caliber. For the most part the accents are well done as well. (Sean Bean has a few problems; for Frances McDormand its piece of cake taking her back into Fargo territory.) Charlize Theron may get an Oscar nomination for her work here although the performance is not as intense or memorable as the one she gave in Monster. McDormand and Woody Harrelson provide solid support. Sissy Spacek is underused and doesnt add much. But the one I want to single out is character actor Richard Jenkins who is superb. Jenkins portrayal of Joseys conflicted father is believable and powerful. Jenkins is one of those actors whose face is more familiar than his name. He has appeared in more than 60 movies and TV productions and is probably best known for a supporting role in Flirting with Disaster and as a member of the ensemble cast for Six Feet Under. He deserves official recognition for his work in North Country. Director Caro is a woman with a social conscience. Like Whale Rider North Country is a personal drama with strong political overtones. Because of the flawed ending I would judge North Country to be the weaker of the two movies but its refreshing to see a foreign director come to Hollywood and not cave in to pressure to make something sub-par just to get a product ""out there."" North Country is not a perfect motion picture but it is stirring and emotionally forceful and while that may not make it an Oscar contender it makes it worth a trip to the multiplex.

While the magical folkloric elements of ""Whale Rider"" may be its most immediately striking factor the depth of feeling invested by Niki Caro in the bonds between characters holds the movie together. Finely etched bonds -- linking couples family community -- also supply the heart of the New Zealand directors first American feature ""North Country."" A stirring drama about a groundbreaking class action sexual harassment suit pic indulges in movie-ish manipulation in its climactic courtroom scenes. But it remains an emotionally potent story told with great dignity to which women especially will respond giving Warner very solid footing among the fourth-quarter quality releases. In addition to Caros graceful transition from a modestly scaled locally made feature to larger-canvas work and to a highly specific American environment the film represents a confident next step for lead Charlize Theron. Though the challenges of following a career-redefining Oscar role have stymied actresses Theron segues from ""Monster"" to a performance in many ways more accomplished. While the role again calls for the thesp to be deglamorized it has none of the attention-getting physical assists of her transforming turn as Aileen Wuornos. Instead Theron gives a measured deeply felt characterization of a good woman scarred by injustices and inequalities who wants simply to take charge of her life and provide for her children. The strength of both the performance and character anchor the film firmly in the tradition of other dramas about working-class women leading the fight over industrial workplace issues such as ""Norma Rae"" or ""Silkwood."" Inspired by facts lifted from the book ""Class Action The Landmark Case That Changed Sexual Harassment Law"" Michael Seitzmans screenplay moves dexterously between past and present. Beginning in court the drama retraces the grievances that led Josie Aimes (Theron) there the factors that prompted her to seek work in the mans world of a northern Minnesota iron mine and a dark formative episode from her past dredged up in the mining companys standard ""nuts and sluts"" defense. Fresh out of a bad marriage Josie moves back home with her parents Alice (Sissy Spacek) and Hank (Richard Jenkins) both of whom encourage her to overlook her husbands violent tendencies and patch up the marriage. With two kids by different fathers Josie already is the cause of local gossip but her rigid fathers sense of shame intensifies to resentment when she responds to the suggestion of her friend Glory (Frances McDormand) that she seek work at the mine. A veteran pit man Hanks bitterness is minor however compared to the aggression of other miners who respond to the Supreme Courts enforced quotas for women in the sectors shrinking job market with open scorn and sexual intimidation. Present at every level this hostility is amplified with each attempt by Josie to draw attention to the transgressions. Her protests earn her the contempt of the men responsible and also of the women who are the victims. Caro is a humanistic filmmaker her work more satisfying and delicate in sketching the good guys than the bad. The camaraderie between the small group of women miners is observed with a gentle economical touch while the bullying men seem perhaps too collectively irredeemable a presence. When during the turning point in the court hearings a number of people of both genders stand in support of Josie the invisibility of these representatives of good conscience during the earlier misdemeanors underlines a slightly nagging suggestion of heavy-handedness. But the movies genuinely affecting strengths more than overcome this. Aided immeasurably by the gritty unvarnished textures of Chris Menges widescreen camera work which gives the film both physical and emotional majesty Caro creates a vivid sense of the womens isolation and powerlessness. This climate of fear and wariness is achieved not only through scenes depicting the indignities they suffer but also in the sheer brute presence of the mine itself a big clanking industrial monster squatting in the middle of a vast landscape blanketed in snow. The descriptive aerial shots are especially eloquent. The cast too is in top form. Theres no grandstanding in Therons lovely performance just a quiet understanding and sensitivity to the ways in which a woman of average intellect and limited experience can summon the instinctive will to fight. (Without hammering the point the script has Josies articulation of sexual harassment issues fueled by TV coverage of the Anita Hill hearings.) While the drama perhaps doesnt need Glorys devastating illness McDormand as always creates a memorable character whose straight-up savvy manner has made her the only respected woman in the mining company. And ""Fargo"" fans will get a kick out of hearing her mouth those Minnesotan vowels again. Sean Bean gets a welcome break from playing Euro villains bringing gentle nuances to Glorys supportive husband. Woody Harrelson also plays well against type as a former ice hockey star-turned-lawyer who takes on Josies case as he inches hesitantly toward deeper involvement with her. Jenkins and Spacek supply complex shadings to Josies conflicted parents with Hanks unbending anger crumbling as family loyalty and personal morality take hold while Alices traditional religious views of spousal compliance are outweighed by her clear sense of whats right. Seitzmans script maintains a judicious balance between Josies quest for justice and her dealings with family in particular her troubled teenage son (Thomas Curtis). Its this depth of attention to the personal details beyond the dramas frontline agenda that successfully offset the programmatic developments in the later stages of the hearings. The film makes fine use of a lilting score laced with strumming guitars and other strings. In addition to his contributions to ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" Gustavo Santaolallas skill at creating a subtle distinctive musical mood makes him one of the most interesting film composers to emerge in recent years.
