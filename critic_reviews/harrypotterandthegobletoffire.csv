Rowlings fourth book is considered a critical turning point. Its the first novel in which Harry fails to vanquish foes the first to kill off a significant character the first to chronicle the initial blush of Harrys interest in girls and the first to note Rons metamorphosis into (as Harry might say) a right foul git. But most of all Harry Potter and the Gobletof Fire begins that black descent into a terrifying world order -- not simply for Harry and his pals at Hogwarts but for everyone wizards and Muggles all. It is a big sloppy slab of fiction a meandering tonally spastic beast of 734 pages that should have been cut by 200. But by its end when evil has risen from the dust and Harry is facing unimagined horrors it is irresistible fantastically tragic storytelling. And so by its end is the movie. This newest film -- from Donnie Brasco director Mike Newell the series first bona-fide Brit at the helm -- is neither the best nor worst in the canon and its neither the most nor least faithful to its source. Steven Kloves screenplay toys with new elements and fanatics should know that whole subplots are absent (dont go looking for the Society for the Protection of Elvish Welfare) along with 99.9 percent of the Quidditch World Cup. No sexpot Veelas either. The spine of the tale remains the Triwizard Tournament a harrowing magical competition that chucks Harry and three fellow students into the fray with dragons mermaids and other necromantic obstacles designed to challenge their wizardly knowledge and wandly skills. We know that the satanic Lord Voldemort is still after Harry and we know that somebody -- nobody nice probably one of You-Know-Whos slimy minions -- entered an unwitting Harry in the competition perhaps to get him killed. Life turns stormy for the poor kid forcing Radcliffe to follow suit After years of relying on his undeniable dewy cuteness he rolls up his sleeves and acts. Beyond that the film preserves much of what made the book both problematic and absorbing. It still rambles. It still feels like a tussle between multiple personalities -- between adolescent primping and apocalyptic combat between hormones and war. (Then again hormones are war.) Muddling things further are its overcooked under-imagined action set pieces. Yet in its last third The Goblet of Fire builds to a climax of such overpowering dread that you might just forget the rest. Harry grows up in an instant and the film does too. Before the final credits roll the Potter saga has transformed into a fully matured allegory of elemental struggle a knock-down drag-out between opposing forces. Harry good Voldemort evil. Any questions? One more thing This is nightmare material. I wouldnt bring my 5-year-old and neither should you. The Harry Potter epic may have started out as childrens fare but it certainly isnt kids stuff any longer. Todays Deals Wide-Ruled 70-Sheet Spiral-Bound Notebook for 17 cents +...

Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is now 14 and hes one of four contestants competing in the dangerous Tri-Wizard Tournament. The first event requires him to capture a golden egg thats guarded by a ferocious Hungarian flying dragon. Terrifying as this is it pales in comparison with having to ask the beguiling Cho Chang (Katie Leung) to Hogwartss Yule Ball. Now that takes courage.The hormonal confusions of adolescence threaten the camaraderie of Harry Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson). But if the teenagers are experiencing growing pains the movie series has come into its own. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" may not reach the lyrical heights of Alfonso Cuarons stylish ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" but this fourth installment directed by Mike Newell has a stronger tale to tell. And the storytelling is so assured that its 144-minute running time feels half that--unlike the first two movies which felt twice as long as they actually were.Newell (""Donnie Brasco"" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") and screenwriter Steve Kloves have made the funniest the scariest and possibly the most human of the series. It also offers our first up-close-and-personal glimpse of Harrys great antagonist Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). There will be debate among Potter fans whether Fienness archvillain matches their direst expectations. At worst his scene is a near miss. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The uncontestable triumph of ""Goblet of Fire"" however is Brendan Gleesons Alastor (Mad-Eye) Moody the grizzled new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. With a face like cracked pottery and a manner both menacing and mentoring he becomes Harrys protector as he faces life-threatening tests. Gleeson one of the screens greatest character actors steals every scene hes in--no small feat when youre up against Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman.Kloves has streamlined J. K. Rowlings 700-plus-page opus into cinematic fighting form. And the special effects which threatened to overwhelm the first two movies are seamlessly integrated. The question now becomes can the next two episodes be finished before Radcliffe Grint and Watson literally outgrow their roles?Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

This ""Potter"" earns its PG-13 rating _ a first for the previously PG series about the boy wizard _ as Harry grows into adolescence and learns more about his powers and his past. Of course young fans have already devoured the J.K. Rowling books that provide the basis for the films so they know whats coming. (The author is up to No. 6 out of seven planned.) But reading it on the page and seeing it on the screen can be two entirely different experiences and several scenes will be disturbing to viewers regardless of age. ""Goblet of Fire"" features the return of the dreaded Lord Voldemort _ He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named _ the dark warlock who killed Harrys parents and tried to kill him too when he was just an infant. (Having survived the attack is what gives Harry a certain mystique among his professors and classmates at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry; it also gave him his trademark lightning-bolt scar on his forehead.) As played by an unrecognizable Ralph Fiennes Voldemort appears hairless and noseless hissing and threatening in the moonlight _ a smooth almost effeminate incarnation of the Devil surrounded by cloaked minions. Even scarier though is the maze Harry must navigate as a competitor in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament. The giant hedges that serve as the maze walls arent just tall and the pathways arent just narrow _ theyre also predatory collapsing violently on their inhabitants sensing and feeding on their fears trying to swallow them whole. (Bet Stanley Kubrick wishes hed thought of that when he made ""The Shining."") While these are the most extreme examples of the movies intensity theyre also the ones that are the most emotionally powerful. Director Mike Newell has crafted a film full of images that are vast and wondrous but strangely detached and obviously artificial similar to the look of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. You can appreciate the enormity of the visuals but they seem so distant its difficult to feel engaged by them. But with Newell at the helm _ the first English director following American Chris Columbus who did the first two parts and Mexican Alfonso Cuaron who did the third and best thus far _ ""Goblet of Fire"" seems more in touch with the innate Britishness of Rowlings books both in its sense of humor and in its boarding-school setting. Newell (working from a script by Steve Kloves who has adapted all of Rowlings books and had his work cut out for him with the 734-page ""Goblet of Fire"") seems less interested in the whimsical magicality of Hogwarts halls _ thankfully since were all over the moving staircases and talking portraits by now _ and focuses more on Harry and his friends as they come of age. ""Goblet of Fire"" is more effective in these smaller more intimate moments than in the bloated bombast of its larger set pieces. One of Newells best-known and loved films is ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and he applies that same keen sense of romantic comedy timing here. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe more confident than ever) Hermione (Emma Watson more vibrant than ever) and Ron (Rupert Grint whos well still a little goofy) are beginning to figure out who they are and struggling to understand the opposite sex something theyre forced to do upon the unexpected arrival of students from two other schools. The sophisticated young women of the Beauxbatons Academy and the virile vaguely Eastern European young men from the Durmstrang Institute are visiting Hogwarts for the year to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. As headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) explains it this is an opportunity to foster relations in the wizarding community; its also the first time for us to see that there is indeed a world outside Hogwarts and England. The Goblet of Fire spits out the name of one student from each school to participate in this grueling challenge Hogwarts BMOC Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson); Beauxbatons glamour girl Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy); and Durmstrangs Quidditch star Viktor Krum (Staniskav Ianevski). Then it offers a fourth name _ you guessed it _ Harry Potter even though the rules state that hes too young to compete at age 14. Surely darker forces are behind his selection which hell have to confront in the films overlong climax. But first hell have to dance at the Yule Ball _ awkwardly of course since he and his classmates have received only cursory uncomfortable lessons from Maggie Smiths Professor McGonagall. (Brendan Gleeson a fantastic new addition to the cast as the schools bad-boy Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher just stands in the corner with his flask and his one fake eye which has a mind of its own.) The whole scene is like something out of a John Hughes movie _ funny relatable and loaded with misunderstandings with everyone in attendance wishing they were there with someone else or not at all. In its realism its one of the most magical moments of all. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" a Warner Bros.

Everything you need to know about the whole can be found in the climactic scene when Johnny proposes to a resistant June during their legendary performance in Ontario in 1968. Before then its been one convention piled (mostly enjoyably) on another -- his pill-popping and boozing his generally loutish behavior divorce and downfall then his regeneration at the hands of a loving woman and his comeback concert at Folsom Prison. But proposing on stage? Well seeing and hearing are believing. The music is marvelous (the proposal grows out of a duet of ""Jackson"") the vocal work is spirited (both stars do their own singing amazingly well) and the feeling is intimate. In the midst of Cashs grand gesture the camera brings us close to two people negotiating their future in urgent whispers. ENLARGE James Mangold directed this superior biographical film from an adaptation that he and Gill Dennis based on two Johnny Cash books ""Man In Black"" and ""Cash The Autobiography."" The productions concern with detail is obvious despite a smoothing of harsh surfaces -- the film is rated PG-13 -- and a dulling repetitiveness to Cashs bouts with addiction. (His music was original but as in last years biopic ""Ray"" his demons were not.) The film opens in 1968 with what sounds like an incipient prison riot and proves to be an audience of Folsom prisoners waiting for Cash to make his entrance. Its an impressive prelude to a flashback structure that follows the singer from his boyhood on an Arkansas cotton farm through his slow tentative emergence as a force in country music. The glowing cinematography by Phedon Papamichael contrasts beautifully with the heros bleak exterior (and black wardrobe); Joaquin Phoenix plays his character with a plainness and reserve that border on austerity. Reese Witherspoon on the other hand holds nothing in reserve and shes nothing less than sensational. With boundless zest plus a wondrously piercing onstage voice she portrays June as a lusty kewpie doll who cant stop cutting up long enough to give her fine singing voice a chance. The moment Ms. Witherspoon comes on screen the movie gets a jolt of star juice that is stunning to behold. Her performance will surely provoke debates over who steals the film from whom but the truth is that she and Joaquin Phoenix are perfectly complementary. His Cash is often childlike and earnest though vibrating with repressed anger and violence while her Carter is a clown -- a transplanted radio comic really a sort of cornpone Gracie Allen -- yet readily capable of great warmth and tenderness. ""Walk the Line"" doesnt transcend all the simplifications of the genre. Johnnys ups and downs are provoked entirely by his relationship with June. When she rejects him he becomes a dissolute monster onstage and off. When her resistance weakens his ego strengthens. Ginnifer Goodwin does what she can -- quite a lot -- with the generic role of Johnnys jealous and unhappy first wife. In almost every scene though the director James Mangold manages to find unexpected life and emotional if not always biographical truth. (In one such scene a painfully tentative gospel-singing Cash is challenged fatefully by Sam Phillips the fabled founder of Memphiss Sun Records.) The very strong supporting cast includes Dallas Roberts as Phillips; Robert Patrick as Cashs rigid punishing father; Shelby Lynne as his long-suffering mother and Waylon Payne as a more-than-sufficiently high-voltage version of Jerry Lee Lewis. David J. Bomba designed the handsome production Arianne Phillips did the costumes and T-Bone Burnett supervised the music which thanks to the co-stars live performances is even better than it needed to be. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" the fourth screen adaptation of J.K. Rowlings books Harry must pass a series of life-threatening tests on his way to wizardly maturity. Although coming of age can be hard for anyone this kid really has it rough -- terrifying apparitions including nubile girls confront him at every turn. The production also represented a test for Warner Bros. the studio that not only milks but must nurture one of the greatest cash cows in movie history. The previous Harry Potter directed by Alfonso Cuaron from a script by Steve Kloves (who has done all the adaptations thus far) was flat-out wonderful and hard to top; a lesser achievement this time could have weakened the franchises future. But the studio like plucky Harry passes with flying colors. The new one directed by Mike Newell from another astute script by Mr. Kloves is even richer and fuller as well as dramatically darker. Its downright scary how good this movie is. (Too scary for very young children which is why the rating is PG-13.) And its particularly scary for actors who arent of the British (or Irish) persuasion. Watching the remarkable cast in action youd think they owned the exclusive rights to the language of Shakespeare. This is not to suggest the Bard of Hogwarts is up there with the Bard of Avon only that her words turn into music coming out of the mouths of such performers as Maggie Smith Michael Gambon Brendan Gleeson Ralph Fiennes Gary Oldman Alan Rickman Robbie Coltrane and Miranda Richardson. Mr. Gleeson and Ms. Richardson are new additions to the group. He plays ever so lustily Mad-Eye Moody Hogwarts latest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who wears an eye patch with an eerily roving eye set into the patch. She plays Rita Skeeter a nitwit journalist who gets everything wrong. (Thats the only false note.) Daniel Radcliffe has grown in the title role not just chronologically while Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermione are spunkier and funnier than ever. Given that the book runs more than 700 pages the screen adaptation is a model of concision even though the movie runs 154 minutes inevitably compressing some elements and leaving others out. The main set pieces however are intact and visualized majestically The Quidditch World Cup the campsite of which is invaded by the Death Eaters who look like Klansmen and signal the return of the evil Lord Voldemort; the Triwizard Tournament in which Harry who never asked to compete must deal with dragons do deep-lake diving and make his way through a maze that wants to eat him; and the Yule Ball a sumptuous affair as devised by the production designer Stuart Craig at which Hermione whos becoming a great beauty makes a radiant entrance worthy of Cinderella. (Part of the radiance comes from Roger Pratts superb cinematography.) Becoming is at the movies heart. Yes the digital effects are phenomenal -- midget dragons oversize dragons a flying coach drawn by seven white birds a fully rigged ship rising from beneath a lake aerial shots of the Hogwarts campus that truly put the fanciful buildings on the map -- but theyre so skillfully interwoven with the main action that you take them for granted as casual magic. The most rewarding spectacle is that of Harry Ron and Hermione becoming creatures who can almost pass for grownups. Its perfectly charming that Harry can handle dragons but not the terrifying task of inviting a pretty classmate to the ball. Its delicious when Maggie Smiths tart Professor McGonagall trying to teach Ron the rudiments of ballroom dancing tells him to put his right hand on her waist and he says ""What?"" with bottomless horror. After the calm confident pace of the first half the second half feels relatively rushed (though here I am suggesting that 154 minutes might not be long enough). The Triwizard Tournament entrants from rival schools are merely props. I especially wish theyd done more with Clemence Poesy and her teammates from the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic who make their entrance in svelte Armani-esque uniforms like a corps de ballet from an MGM musical. But these are small matters when measured against the sweep of Harry Potters new adventure. A good boy on his way to being a man Harry deserves the best and he gets it.    DVD TIP Reese Witherspoon lights up the Harvard Yard and everything else in ""Legally Blonde."" This 2001 film directed by Robert Luketic from a script by Karen McCullah Lutz is sometimes described sniffily as ""Clueless Goes to Harvard."" Dont let that fool you. Its as smart as can be and Ms. Witherspoons Elle a supposedly dumb blonde from California who gains admission to Harvard Law School is one of the most joyous comic creations of modern American movies. (The sequel wouldnt you know is awful.)

Comments Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Free Rated PG-13  157 minutes A marked disappointment after Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) this fourth installment in the franchise is a 157-minute holding pattern in which neither of the ongoing stories--Harrys conflict with the evil sorcerer Voldemort the young schoolmates coming-of-age at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft--progresses much. The rangy plot centers on a magic decathlon between rival schools allowing for the usual splendid special effects but I was more charmed by a brief centerpiece in which the kids prepare for and attend their first prom--with the chronically embarrassed Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) being tutored in dance by the prim Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith). Mike Newell (Mona Lisa Smile) directed; with Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Miranda Richardson Michael Gambon Robbie Coltrane and far too little of Alan Rickman. By J.R.

"Get ready for Goblet - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Get ready for GobletHarry Potter saga takes spellbinding new turn toward darker maturityNovember 17 2005|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic`HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE(star)(star)(star)1/2Unlike Peter Pan that other magical airborne boy of British literature and film J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter just keeps growing up. So do the Potter movies in size in ambition and in visual splendor -- and with increasingly stunning results.""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is the latest film adventure of the bespectacled student sorcerer of Rowlings amazingly well-imagined Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And it may be the best filmed Potter of them all -- though last years Potter No. 3 ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" already took a quantum leap forward in quality and sophistication.Yet this new picture raises the stakes again. Crammed with dragons and wizards mad-eyed watchdogs and will-o-the-wisp charms -- but also with a surprising new dark maturity that embraces real death and the nature of evil -- ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" the first PG-13-rated film in the series is the most adult of all the four Potter movies to date. Following Harry (Daniel Radcliffe now 16) through his fourth year at Hogwarts and his 14th year of life the movie once again shows him learning the wizard profession with his chums spunky Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and sometimes jealous Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and its pretty much a constant marvel.Technological marvels dont always make for good movies of course. The first two ""Harrys"" struck me as a little over-confectionary and overloud. But ""Goblet"" has enough sense of real kids maturing and believably facing problems to cast some genuine spells.Most important this is the story that finally puts Harry face to (not-quite) face with Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) the evil nemesis who killed his parents. Producer David Heyman cinematographer Roger Pratt and new director Mike Newell help flood the screen with the usual technological amazements incredibly believable phantoms flying submersible sailing ships dragons golden eggs living paintings and lively stained-glass windows a rollickingly opulent kids costume ball and a vast forest maze that suggests a jacked-up version of the climax of ""The Shining.""Then theres the Goblet itself a magical vessel filled with blue flame from which magisterial head Hogwartian Professor Dumbledore (played by that matchless ""Singing Detective"" Michael Gambon) pulls the names of the young wizard-school champions who will compete in the suitably spectacular Triwizard Tournament.One of them of course is Harry -- unexpectedly since hes technically too young to get it on with his over-17 fellow contestants scowling Bulgarian Victor Krum of Durmstrang (Stanlislav Zaneski) heartstopping French Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy) of Beauxbatons Academy and the actual Hogwarts champion and B.W.O.C. (Best Wizard on Campus) stalwart young Brit Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson).Yet the goblet somehow also coughs up Potters name to the consternation of both Harrys friend (Ron) and foe (Tom Felton as spoiled rat-brat Draco Malfoy). Soon the chosen quartet are off on a series of mind-bending contests which leads to a surprisingly grief-stricken semi-inspiring resolution.Newells ""Goblet"" isnt a perfect coup. Its not quite as fancifully funny and smashingly inventive as director Alfonso Cuarons ""Azkaban"" nor as smooth and seamless a piece of storytelling. Writer Kloves scenario is cleverly compressed but it still seems a little crammed and overstuffed. And of course it is 734 pages of novel jammed into 157 minutes of screen time.That crammed quality is most evident in the movies first half hour or so. Immediately after the titles the filmmakers hurl us into a dark sweaty kiddie-noir nightmare starring the unseen Voldemort and insidious little ratfink Wormtail (played by that magnificently mole-faced ""Secrets amp; Lies"" guy Timothy Spall) then shuttle us through Hogwarts halls and zip us off to the Olympian spectacle of the Quidditch World Cup a super-sports match in a gargantuan multimedia stadium packed with roaring throngs and rainbow teams.Then right in mid-Quidditch they cut to a torrent of campsite devastation wreaked by the Death Eaters followers of the corpselike ""Seventh Seal""-faced Voldemort.That whole stretch may be fairly confusing if you havent read the book. But the rest of the movie is crystal-ball clear. Knowing the devotion of mainline Potter fans producer Heyman and writer Steve Kloves stick as faithfully to Rowling as possible. And just as ""Azkaban"" surprised with its wild wit and fantasy ""Goblet"" has some spells up its sleeve plus a breadth most of the other films lacked a deeper sense of character and a really wonderful British cast.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesHarry his movie grow up go deeper and darkerNovember 18 2005For Emma Watson the holidays mean time for serious studyingDecember 20 2005Director brings fresh approachJune 3 2004ABC will give viewers Potter sneak peekApril 26 2005Find More Stories AboutHarry PotterEmma WatsonGobletTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-11-17/features/0511180380_1_harry-potter-new-director-mike-newell-goblet,200,harrypotterandthegobletoffire5,harrypotterandthegobletoffire,chicagotribune

Brit helmsman Mike Newells made a fine fist of Steven Kloves screenplay injecting even more Angloisms into JK Rowlings quintessentially British fantasy tale. If theres a problem its with the length of Rowlings source material; its simply too long to fit into 160 minutes without having large chunks of storyline left on the cutting room floor. Consequently those who havent read any of the Harry Potter books may find this latest episode particularly confusing characters flit in and out without explanation and scenes change without warning (indeed the first 100 pages or so - dealing with the Quidditch World Cup - are dispensed with in less than two minutes).As a spectacle though Goblet is deliciously dark wickedly funny and superbly mounted; it also sports some fine turns especially Ralph Fiennes evil Lord Voldemort and Brendan Gleesons cockeyed wizard Alastor Moody. Newell keeps the action centred on two key events from the book the Hogwarts Yule Ball and the Triwizard Tournament (a distinctly dangerous trio of tasks involving stupendously rendered CGI dragons scary mermaid-like octopuses called Grindylows and an ominous maze). Along the way loyalties are tested as Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) falls out of favour with his misguided chums most notably Rupert Grints Ron Weasley (whos grown into a strapping longhair who says bloody hell a lot) and Emma Watsons Hermione Granger (whos pissed off because neither Harry nor Ron have asked her to the ball). The ten-year-olds I took along loved every minute of it despite the creepy opening and violent climax. Stroll on number five then.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Faced with the challenge of adapting an immensely popular 700-page-plus book to film knowing full well that virtually every cut would be greeted with wails from the books millions of fans worldwide director Mike Newell and screenwriter Steven Kloves made an entirely reasonable decision They cut virtually everything from Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire that would be redundant with the previous three movie adaptations of J.K. Rowlings record-breaking bestsellers. Gone from the story the usual intro featuring Harry Potters obnoxious relatives any scenes of the boy wizard learning or experimenting with magic most of the conflict between him and his rival Draco Malfoy and so forth. Whats left isnt quite lean and propulsive At over two and a half hours its still bulky and a handful of scenes drag dubiously while the opening and closing both feel rushed. But whenever it hits its stride its a well-acted vividly executed full-speed-ahead special-effects extravaganza that puts as much bang as possible into every remaining scene. The fourth installment in Rowlings Harry Potter series catches up with the returning cast of the first three movies as they enter their fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where a traditional three-school wizarding competition is about to be held. Against his will and against the rules Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) gets dragged into the competition though not before a great deal of setup involving portentous dreams the Quidditch World Cup and the inevitable arrival of Hogwarts new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher (Brendan Gleeson). Much of the movie is devoted to the contest which lends itself to explosive setpieces involving dragons mermaids and a malevolent hedge maze but Newell and Kloves manage to wedge in a great deal of economical setup and fulfillment with foreshadowing backstory and intercharacter conflict all pared down to essentials but still given room to breathe. By this point in the story its unlikely that the Harry Potter movies are going to win many new converts; to their credit Newell and Kloves dont really try. With its slam-bang-whoosh-giggle-gasp mentality Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire could be a halfway decent thrill ride for newbies to the series. But its less-explanation more-momentum mentality is really aimed squarely at the fans whod likely rather see more well-timed business from their favorite characters than a pile of dreary exposition and reminders about the story to date. For all its length Goblet Of Fire speeds past all too quickly. But the real accomplishment may be that for all its brevity it still feels like it tells the important parts of Rowlings story.

By Anthony Lane Of the many virtues that unite Harvard Princeton and the University of Illinois the most compelling is the fact that the library of each institution contains a manuscript version of the following poem. It is called ""The Wish"" and I quote it in full Oh that I could by any chemic art To sperm convert my spirit and my heart That at one thrust I might my soul translate And in the womb myself regenerate There steeped in lust nine months I would remain Then boldly fuck my passage back again. Four aspects of this work immediately spring to mind. First and most obvious it renders the lifelong labors of Sigmund Freud almost entirely superfluous. Second it has been credited to the pen of John Wilmot second Earl of Rochester although scholarly doubt surrounds the attribution. Third if Rochester did write the poem he must have done so at the age of fourteen. And fourth he is now the subject of a film. Sadly the movie in question is not a dramatic adaptation of ""The Wish"" which is surely crying out for the digital talents of Pixar but a bio-pic entitled ""The Libertine."" Written by Stephen Jeffreys and directed by Laurence Dunmore it stars Johnny Depp as Rochester. If you threw together a beefy blend of Depps other roles--a shot of Hunter S. Thompson a slice of Jack the pirate a mouthful of Willy Wonka--you could scarcely hope to concoct anything as highly seasoned as His Lordship. ""You will not like me"" he declares at the start with more than a touch of the imperative. He peers at us from a backdrop so rich in gloom that it might as well be the nether depths of Hell--which for anyone wishing to pinpoint Rochesters current location remains the most plausible place to begin. His reluctant emergence from the womb took place in 1647 and he went to his grave in 1680 hurried along by the pox. The wonder is not that he expired so young but that he endured so long having packed more transgressions into one of his lazier evenings than most of us rack up in a decade. To say that Rochester was a philanderer is like suggesting that Dean Martin was fond of a tipple. Mind you the poets own leaning toward the bottle was close to Martinesque. He was double trouble Cupid and Bacchus my saints are. May drink and love still reign With wine I wash away my cares And then to cunt again. What matters about Rochester is that unlike the majority of sex addicts he never allowed his addiction to shrink him into a bore. Instead his curiosity swelled to encompass the rest of the population whom he cheerfully imagined--with a scabrous presumption not heard since the Rome of Juvenal--to be every bit as addicted as he. Hence ""A Ramble in St. Jamess Park"" with its democratic overview of lust Car-men divines great lords and tailors Prentices pimps poets and jailers Footmen fine fops do here arrive And here promiscuously they swive. That is one of the quieter moments in the poem. Other passages stream past in which the only vaguely respectable noun is ""sluice."" The result is not just polluted but also crisp and funny although you would never know that from the film in which Depp recites a few lines in a morose incantation and wandering through the park in a mist finds himself besieged by visions of writhing orgiasts. They resemble one of the more unfortunate dream sequences from an old Ken Russell picture whereas the actual Rochester was laying out with unblinking eyes the map of a well-known world. As for the mist it never clears; most of ""The Libertine"" unfurls in a soup of brown light. It cannot be smog because Rochester predated the industrial revolution so I conclude that the director who plainly fancies himself a symbolist is bent on moral miasma. One gets the point but again it muddies the clarity and verve with which Rochester confronted his times. Wisely Dunmore makes no attempt to cover the poets entire life; it may have been short but then so is a mortar attack. We see nothing of Rochesters Grand Tour through Europe say or his reported courage in two naval battles. We see his patient wife (Rosamund Pike) whom he feels up in the back of a jolting carriage but not their four children. Instead the movie plunges into the mid-sixteen-seventies with Charles II (John Malkovich) long since restored to the throne and an elegant raillery unloosed upon the stage. A bored and boozy Rochester himself restored after a period of disgrace--he was forever getting thrown out of court for doing or writing the wrong thing--hangs around with friends like Sir George Etherege (Tom Hollander). It was Etherege who immortalized him in his play ""The Man of Mode"" ""I know he is a Devil but he has something of the Angel yet undefacd in him."" What pricks the poets interest and vice versa is the presence of a new actress Elizabeth Barry (Samantha Morton) to whom he becomes a mentor. This is no cinematic fancy. She was indeed the leading lady of her day and the correspondence between them is a stately procession of pain affection envy reproach and workaday desire ""Dear Madam"" one letter begins ""You are stark mad and therefore the fitter for me to love."" There is one overriding reason to watch ""The Libertine"" and that is the scene in which the hero instructs the heroine in the passionate possibilities of her art. She stands on the stage with candles burning hazily like underwater flares and as the camera swims around her she melts. It is one long seduction and yet no clothes are removed; rather her theatrical awkwardness is stripped away. Depp and Morton are really flying here and they leave the rest of the film looking heavy on its feet. The second half especially grows dour and maundering and by the end the movie seems to flail in desperation more like a work in progress than like a finished piece. It was shot a while ago and the makers evidently struggled to bring it to fruition; if so they missed a trick. I counted four actors in ""The Libertine"" who also appear in the new ""Pride amp; Prejudice""; so why not go the whole hog combine the two period dramas and thereby halve the budget? Who wouldnt want to watch five Bennet girls unleashed on Charles II? Rochester had a ball in St. Jamess Park but believe me if you havent seen Darcy on the loose or the sluice you dont know what swiving is. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is now fourteen and while he gives little sign of doing what Lord Rochester planned to do at the same age there are nonetheless changes afoot. Harrys voice like that of his best friend Ron (Rupert Grint) sounds like the mating cry of an oboe and worse still the two cease to be best friends. Meanwhile at Hogwarts all is set for the Triwizard Tournament. This involves three chosen students each from a different school meeting three herculean challenges; the victor receives a cup wrought of rarest crystal the kind that you get for winning a pro-celebrity tennis fest in Palm Springs. Such is the setting for ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" the thirty-seventh--or ""fourth"" as Warner Bros. amusingly claims--installment in the Potterite saga. It is directed by Mike Newell who does a more coherent job than his predecessors; they tended to linger over the early setups and then scramble toward a confusing climax whereas Newell measures out the magic with some aplomb. Still he cannot do much about the slightly tired sadism that is creeping into the cracks of the Potter franchise. The tournament for instance is hailed with rah-rah enthusiasm like any other sporting event yet it basically entails putting a bunch of young people through dragonish perils and mortifying fear all for the edification of the youthful masses and their freaky overlords. Caligula would have liked it. By a pleasing irony the parts of the film that stay with you are concerned not with the dark arts but with something far more unstoppable teen-agers. There is a fine scene in which Harry Ron and the scarily poised Hermione (Emma Watson) are sitting in study hall and talking under their breath about the imminent school dance--who will go with whom which sad student has yet to be asked and so on. In short they behave like humans (or Muggles as we must call ourselves) and their chatter comes as a relief after the relentlessness of their enchanted lives. The unspoken apartheid of the J. K. Rowling world where wizards look down often literally on the subspecies of regular folk has meant that the movies dwell exclusively among wizards and follow wizard rules; might it not be however that the superhuman will retain its meaning and its comic torque only when entwined with aspects of the human? That is why Hermione observing Ron and Harry in their galumphing efforts to make up exclaims not ""Wizards"" but in exasperation ""Boys."" The film closes with yet another clash of good and evil--the most elemental to date with Lord Voldemort himself (Ralph Fiennes) putting in a guest appearance and looking like the English Patient on steroids. What matters in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" though and what will allow the remaining films to prosper is the words that we hear at the start from an elderly caretaker ""Bloody kids.""

"The new scarier Harry Potter. Slate Sign In Sign Up The new scarier Harry Potter. The new scarier Harry Potter. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 18 2005 606 AM Scary Harry A more sinister Potter. By David Edelstein Leave your kids at home for this one? Having grumbled about the twinkly inexpressive family-movie ambiance of the first (Chris Columbus-helmed) Harry Potter adaptation I can only give thanks that each subsequent installment has been darker and creepier; that the last Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban directed by Alfonso Cuaron seemed organically rendered--from the inside out--instead of storyboarded from on high by neutered elves; and that the newest Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Warner Bros.) is a ghoulish PG-13 horror picture from its first scene--one of those caretaker-investigating-a-strange-light-in-an-old-dark-house numbers. No I couldnt be more pleased with what the screenwriter Steven Kloves and the director Mike Newell have wrought this time. That said I stood my ground and left my 7-year-old (who devoured the book) at home. Weak-willed parents of similarly aged children should prepare for night sweats and bed-wetting. Its scary kids. Goblet of Fire has little in the way of niceties no blithe schoolboy (or -girl) mischief-making no wisecracking portraits no bizarre but lovable pets and barely a frame of Quidditch. (A murderous army of Death Eaters interrupts the World Cup festivities.) More terrifying puberty has finished its work and dating is now neck-and-neck with Voldemort as Harrys most soul-wrenching preoccupation. At this point in J.K. Rowlings series its clear that he and Hermione are not destined to fall into each others arms. While Hermione and Ron resort to traditional British bickering in the face of their undeclared attraction Harry stews over a fetching classmate named Cho Chang (Katie Leung) who turns out to have a Scottish brogue--how adorable--and no personality. Advertisement Daniel Radcliffes Harry is aging to look like Elijah Woods dour pinched brother--but Ive never minded his lack of color. Too much acting might interfere with our ability to project ourselves into his head and vicariously experience the fruits of his celebrity. Radcliffe does need all the help he can get from Rupert Grints Ron his red hair in a Beatles shag and Emma Watsons Hermione who continues to demonstrate that humorless know-it-all valedictorian grinds can be madly attractive provided you have the right casting director. Speaking of casting its always a treat to see what big-studio-franchise cash can produce in the way of top-flight British (and Irish) actors. The islands have been swept for great thespians; this movie must have closed the theaters for months. Along with the peerlessly bitchy Alan Rickman Maggie Smith Robbie Coltrane (smitten with a visiting giantess who looks like an elongated Judith Miller--only nicer) and Michael Gambon (who has found his Dumbledore injecting a dose of irony into his lines) we get more Gary Oldman (albeit only as a smoke-and-ash face in a fireplace) more Timothy Spall (vermin with a pedigree) and best of all more of the delicious Shirley Henderson as Moaning Myrtle (now sneaking peeks at Harrys privates). There are three additions Miranda Richardson--regrettably one-note--as a journalist who has made up her mind about Harry well in advance of their interview (i.e. the normal-sized Judith Miller); the amusing glowerer Brendan Gleeson as the latest Defense Against the Dark Arts professor; and Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. Fiennes rises from a cauldron of what looks like primordial slime--and proves worthy of it. The Dark Wizards frame is all there but his features arent filled in Hes like a statue sculpted from pus a raging infection on legs. The scariest thing is Fiennes voice. While Voldemort moves jerkily not quite at home in his body his diction is supple and edged with cold steel. All form and sterling elocution he is every inch the English public-school-bred bogeyman.

Many perhaps millions of them were six or eight when the first wallop of Harrymania struck the U.S. in the summer of 1999. They are tweeners or a little older now within cracking-voice shouting distance of the young wizards 16 years -- in the sixth book The Half-Blood Prince published this summer -- or 14 years his age in the new movie version of the fourth installment Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Kids pick up a thing or two as they grow up; they may have learned a bit from the J.K. Rowling books and the films. The tone of the first two movies The Sorcerers Stone (2001) and The Chamber of Secrets (2002) may have appealed to a fascination with the capricious machinery of meta-natural laws at Hogwarts school. The movies spookiness was a Halloween trick (or if they liked it treat) -- the equivalent of a mischievous uncle shouting Boo on the other side of the door. Just what youd expect from director Chris Columbus whose notion of childhood stretches from funny-scary (he directed Home Alone) to scary-funny (he scripted the evil-kids-on-the-rampage Gremlins). As the Potter sagas proceed through the canon they have turned darker more fraught; and the older wiser kids can sense the difference like a sepulchral chill in their bones. They know the change is not from a childs reality to a adolescents nightmares but from daydreams to the convulsive world of adolescence. Maturity is realizing that the thing we fear most is not what haunts us in our sleep but what we awake to. Everybody reading this is familiar with the outlines of the Goblet plot -- Hogwarts hosting of a Tri-Wizard Tournament in which Harry is mysteriously chosen as a fourth contestant -- so well cut quickly through the maze and say that this is the first Potter film to improve on the book. One reason is that this was the first episode in Rowlings series to feel too long; I suspect that the unique popularity of the earlier novels had intimidated her editors and petrified their blue pencils. Whatever the reason Goblet consumed 734 pages more than the length of the first two books combined. It was a challenge for kids not just to read the book but to lift it. (Isometric exercises for fifth graders?) Rowling took the first 100 pages to describe just two main scenes a fleeting glimpse of arch-villain Voldemort and his abettors and the Quidditch World Cup disrupted by Vs shrouded hooligans. The story continues at this languid pace which could frustrate even hard-core admirers. I could name two and will. A while back I read the first three books aloud at bedtime to a young female of my acquaintance and we sailed through them in a month. But no resolve could keep her awake through Goblet. That was six years ago and she didnt know how the story came out until she saw the film last week. The Goblet movie gets bustling straight off; those two scenes are dramatized (nicely) and dispensed with in 15-20 minutes. The movie is dense -- every millimeter of screen space is art-directed up the wazoo -- but not congested Terry Gilliam-style. Each of the thousand elements knows its place in the background ceding eye-focus to the story and its increasingly plausible and compelling characters. Columbus helmed the first two Potter chapters and Alfonso Cuaron did wonders with Book Three The Prisoner of Azkaban. This time Producer John Heyman and screenwriter Steve Kloves who have worked on the whole series handed the job to Mike Newell a Brit who has directed a few good tense melodramas (Dance With a Stranger Donnie Brasco) and some engaging sentimental fare (Enchanted April Four Weddings and a Funeral) as well as the ninth-worst movie ever made (his last one Mona Lisa Smile). What does a new director do on a sustained enterprise like the Potter films (or the James Bonds)? My guess is that while the series more or less permanent team keeps the furniture moving so to speak the man-for-hire attends to the films pace and the care and feeding of the actors. Newell did an exemplary job here encouraging and eliciting a community of performance. Daniel Radcliffe is coming along nicely as the young hero though its up for grabs whether the teen actor will have the chest hair to face the horrors in store for Harry. Im getting quite fond of Emma Watson as Harrys pal Hermione. Only Rupert Grints Ron Weasley the whiny ginger kid who represents the working class at Hogwarts tries my patience. The films one unneeded plot strand concerns an estrangement between Ron and Harry. Why bother sundering them when we know theyll get back together? In his second session replacing the late Richard Harris as Hogwarts principal Dumbledore Michael Gambon has a ponderous aristocratic humanism. Gary Oldmans Sirius the human-canine from the third film has a bright cameo as a face in the fireplace. The movie strikes black gold with Alistair Mad-Eye Moody Hogwarts new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Played by Brendan Gleeson with a swagger and spume not seen since Robert Newtons Long John Silver (another charming dastard) Mad-Eye has a globular left orb that stares skeptically maniacally at all it surveys. He seems both amiable and deranged as when he gestures to a steamer trunk whose contents are frantically rattling and says I wont even tell you whats in there. (Well find out later.) Gleeson commandeers acting honors until the very late arrival of Ralph Fiennes as You Know Who ... He Who Must Not Be Named ... The Noseless Wonder ... Voldemort The Tri-Wizard games that expertly filled most of the films time vanish from our minds when His Satanic Majesty appears to retrieve Harry for his purposes. Everythings going to change now isnt it? the boy-king asks later. It will. It has. In the Potter movie series for the better. This first Harry Potter film clocked in at a logorrheic 2hr33 nearly twice the length of a Disney cartoon feature. If The Sorcerers Stone has any merit it was to demonstrate the elasticity of childrens attention spans; it proved that kids could sit still enrapt for ages. Goblet of Fire which is not just an efficient babysitter but a wizard of a movie will prove that adults can too.

Only as ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" begins the brand left by Lord Voldemort murderer of Harrys parents pulses with news more disturbing than a change in climate. A malevolent storm gathers. Voldemorts acolytes are making way for his return. Although Harrys saga no longer begins with the orphans annual escape from the crass grasp of his unpleasant aunt and uncle a hapless muggle still takes a hit. In a cameo appearance an elderly caretaker overhears Voldemort and two of his minions plotting. Just as the codger is ratted out by a serpent Harry awakes. Harry Potter - the boy and the big- screen franchise based on J.K. Rowlings novels - continues to grow up. Its a maturation well worth watching. Directed by Mike Newell (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ) the fourth installment coincides with Harrys fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Expansion abounds in Harrys world. Harry Ron and Hermione face the challenges of puberty. One subplot Who to ask to the Yule Ball? And Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) has decided to host the Triwizard Tournament. Three students from three European academies must compete in a series of daunting even dangerous challenges. When the movies fiery goblet spits out his name Harry becomes the unexpected fourth. Hes much too young and Hogwarts beloved Cedric Diggory has already been selected. His selection leads to peer resentment but also anxiety. Harry hadnt entered the competition so what does it mean that the goblet drafted the 14-year-old? The globes favorite wizard still looks every bit the innocent. Daniel Radcliffe remains the least magnetic of the actors yet is oddly suited for Harrys awkward but honorable demeanor. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint who portray Hermione and Ron do a fine job playing hormone-challenged characters. The ship-smart Hermione is emerging into adult loveliness; Ron embodies that endearing teen-boy collision of soft and lank. At the start of Newells dark and lively film Harry and his chums head to the Quidditch World Cup. Its a sporting event but with its mad encampments and multicultural conjurers it resembles a cross between Burning Man and your local Renaissance Faire. After a wild match masked Death Eaters rain terror down on the gathering. Its a first strike that makes soccer hooligans seem like pranksters. Indeed the fiery mayhem and ensuing panic make plain that the PG-13 ""Goblet"" while not as shocking as the final installment of ""Star Wars"" is not suitable for the wee-est among us. Not that ""Goblet"" is all shadow and menace. Newell deftly mixes in sweet teenage angst and lighter moments of physical humor. The latter comes in the form of the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Alastor ""Madeye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson). As students from two other schools of wizardry arrive at Hogwarts for the Twiwizard Newell does Ray Harryhausen proud. The khaki-clad lads of Durmstrang Institute sail in a ship that surges from beneath the water. The young ladies of Beauxbaton Academy wearing robins-egg blue soar in on a carriage pulled by winged horses. Fantasy films fulfill their destinies when they give children - in this case young adults - ample material to ponder how they might fulfill their own ethically magically honorably or with the tools of bad magic. Evil has had a name since the first Harry Potter novel. Now it has a kind of uncomfortable heft. Theres something timely about the clouds amassing in ""Goblet."" They speak not merely to the weight of Harrys world but our own. And why shouldnt films for young adults resonate not just with the frets and joys they experience with their peers but the mess of the world at large? That Dumbledore doesnt hold all the answers adds another layer of realism to the fantasy. Wars unexpected loss and grief rub against childhood crushes and the quandaries of friendship here - much of it for the better.  | ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images|2 hours 37 minutes |FANTASY| Directed by Mike Newell; written by Steve Kloves; photography by Roger Pratt; starring Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint Emma Watson Robbie Coltrane Ralph Fiennes Michael Gambon Brendan Gleeson Jason Isaacs Gary Oldman Alan Rickman Maggie Smith and Timothy Spall |Opens today at area theaters.

RELATED Gallery A guide to Harry Potter  Gallery Harry Potter characters  Interactive Think you know Harry?  Stars get help handling fame YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- I have enjoyed the magical charms of the Harry Potter franchise since the highly anticipated (and highly hyped) first film ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" cast its spell upon the big screen in November 2001.My love affair with the residents of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry continued with ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" in 2002 and was sustained with ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" in 2004. I not only loved the films; I read the books too.Now in the spirit of full disclosure I did not read ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" (life somehow just got in the way) the fourth in the series. Perhaps that is one reason that the new film based on the book didnt work its wizardry on this reviewer. Frankly the entire film felt like the cinematic version of Hamburger Helper -- too little meat trying to do too much.Im sure that the movie is true to J.K. Rowlings book -- she (or her fans) would allow nothing less. And I am aware that ""Goblet of Fire"" was darker and more sinister then the previous wildly successful books -- this is the first ""Potter"" film with a PG-13 rating -- but still I was a bit underwhelmed. (Watch a look at Harrys darker side -- 158)Im not saying the magic is gone but Ive lost that loving feeling. Director Mike Newell and screenwriter Steve Kloves have attempted to make a movie that is part thriller part action flick and part budding love story. None of the themes mesh together very well. The result feels somewhat clunky and disjointed.""Goblets"" basic plot involves a competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry Hogwarts Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. The contest called the Triwizard Tournament is being hosted at Hogwarts; the prize is the highly coveted Triwizard Cup.The boys from Durmstrang all look like throwbacks from a Hitler youth group and the girls from Beauxbatons devoid of expression float around like butterflies trying to escape a net.At the outset the Goblet of Fire selects one student from each school to compete in three life-threatening tasks; all candidates must be 17 years or older. But after one name from each school is picked the Goblet spits out one more nomination that of 14-year-old Harry. Against his will -- and better judgment -- he resigns himself to playing the game thereby risking his life. Not even Hogwarts headmaster the beloved Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) can save him from taking part.Love and Death EatersBut Harry has other problems working up the nerve to ask his beautiful classmate Cho Chang (Katie Leung) to the annual Yule Ball. Yep the kids are growing up and the hormones are kicking in. Adolescent romance is in the air -- and so is adolescent clumsiness. Ron Weasley is totally oblivious to the growing feelings of Hermione (Emma Watson) as she tries in vain to get him to ask her to the social event of the year.Even Hagrid is not immune to the love bug as he falls under the spell of the flamboyant Madame Maxime (Frances De La Tour) the Headmistress of Beauxbatons. I dont want to be nasty and say this character is amazingly unattractive; lets just say shes perfect for Hagrid.Hovering over all these events is the return of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) who after 13 years is once again appearing in public and has unleashed his followers the Death Eaters to do his dirty work.The cast of Hogwarts instructors has mostly stayed the same but theres one new -- and really interesting character -- in the mix. That would be Mad-Eye Moody played by the excellent Irish character actor Brendan Gleeson (""Gangs of New York"" ""Cold Mountain""). Hes asked by Dumbledore to keep his bright blue eye on Harry and help in any way he can during the tournament.But Mad-Eye is one of the rare sparks in ""Goblet of Fire."" Indeed I guess my biggest beef with the film is that many of the other characters we have grown to love and hate -- Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) his evil father Lucius (Jason Isaacs) Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) Professor Minerva McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) and Hogwarts Academy itself (which has become a character just as much as the human cast) -- are all given short shrift. Even the interaction between Harry Ron and Hermione has been trimmed down to almost nothing.Newell best known for directing ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Pushing Tin"" is not necessarily the go-to guy for projects with computer-generated images but he proves here that hes fast learner and does a commendable job of pulling off all the action needed to make a ""Potter"" film work. Its just that it would have been nice to give him more to work with.So Im less than thrilled. No matter. Seeing a ""Potter"" film is generally worth it. Theres much to appreciate here and there will be many people to appreciate it. And now theres always that fifth film to look forward to.What does Entertainment Weekly think?

Rowling turns out the ""Harry Potter"" novels and like clockwork the movies follow. Notice I didnt say churns out - Rowling is a real writer. But the movie adaptations have been highly variable in quality.The first two - ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" and ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" - were both directed by Chris Columbus. Therein lies the rub. Columbus is a journeyman entertainer but the material called for a magician. Rowlings novels are far richer even as a visual experience than those movies. One reason the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy so easily overshadowed the Columbus films is because Peter Jackson for all his fetishizing of ghouls and glop had a genuine feeling for the fantastical.Things picked up considerably with the film version of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" because its director Alfonso Cuaron had a direct pipeline to childhood imaginings. (His 1995 ""A Little Princess"" is one of the finest of all childrens films - which is another way of saying that everyone who sees it is left enchanted.) Although it doesnt often scale the visionary heights of Cuarons film at its best ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" which was directed by Mike Newell is a worthy successor. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? For one thing Newell is the first Englishman to direct a Potter film and he understands in his bones the rigors and snobbishness of a place like Hogwarts where Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is now in his fourth year. Whatever else the novels are they are also marvelous metaphors for the English class system. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 But as in the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" ""Goblet of Fire"" reveals that system through a glass darkly. Rowlings novel ran to more than 700 pages and screenwriter Steve Kloves who has written all of the films does his usual admirable job of paring the story to its essentials. (That means that S.P.E.W. - a subplot about the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare - had to go.) The new Potter movie has the tension and velocity of a good thriller.Fans of Quidditch may regret that ""Goblet of Fire"" cuts back on the usual aerial whoop-de-do but there is more than enough of the dreaded Triwizard Tournament a competition for which Harry is mysteriously made a participant even though at age 14 he is technically too young to be an entrant. Whoever is responsible for Harrys qualification is up to no good and so Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) enlists ""Mad Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson) the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor to keep his all-seeing blue peeper fixed squarely on Harry.A poignant subtext here is that for the first time Dumbledore is genuinely perplexed by all the evil at work. Hes scared which injects a note of humanity into the proceedings although it does nothing to reassure Harry who must undergo his trials alone and unguided. The Triwizard tasks - which include evading a ferocious dragon diving deep into a great lake and combating a malevolent maze - are increasingly harrowing.Equally harrowing in some respects is the students Yule Ball where for the first time we are made thunderously aware that Harry and the carrot-topped Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are well adolescents. What could be more terrifying?Actually its been apparent for some time that these kids were becoming little men and women and never more so than in that splendiferously comic moment in ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" when Hermione who has gone back in time with Harry sees the back of herself and wails ""Does my hair really look like that?""I wish ""Goblet of Fire"" had a few grace notes of levity to match that one. Just because Maggie Smiths Professor Minerva McGonagall has banned frivolity from Hogwarts doesnt mean the filmmakers should follow suit. But theres ample reason to stay with this series. When Harry says ""I love magic"" you believe it. Grade A- Rated PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images.

Starring Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint Miranda Richardson Brendan Gleeson Michael Gambon and Ralph Fiennes. Directed by Mike Newell. (PG-13. 157 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Isnt that just like kids? One minute theyre mounting broomsticks and lifting off into the wild blue yonder vanishing inside invisible cloaks ministering to werewolf bites and making objects fly with a swish and flick of their wrists. Then -- without so much as an abracadabra -- they reach puberty and become hot and bothered by the opposite sex. The truly magical moments in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" illuminate the transition of Harry and chums Ron and Hermione into adolescence made no less bumpy by powers attained at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A magic wand cant shoo away butterflies in your tummy. Although unable to duplicate that perfect blend of grandeur edginess and pure fantasy achieved in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" -- still the gold standard of the ""Potter"" franchise -- ""Goblet"" offers its own brew of wondrous chimera combined with the wonders of human nature. To take J.K. Rowlings sprawling 734-page opus and shape it into a single movie -- even one clocking in at 2 1/2 hours -- is a difficult task. Avid fans of the novel are sure to be upset by whats missing like the giant squid and all but a passing glimpse of the ever-popular Sirius Harrys protective godfather. Classroom scenes inside Hogwarts have been virtually eliminated; to learn how to handle the pent-up energy of a blast-ended skrewt youll have to read Rowling. Instead Mike Newell the first Brit to direct these distinctly British adventures focuses on the characters humanity as much if not more than their wizardry. Its hardly surprising that the director of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" would fancy ""Goblets"" budding romances. Ron (Rupert Grint) offers the first hint that something other than sorcery is occupying his young mind. At a grand party to celebrate the Triwizard tournament hosted at Hogwarts he watches sexy French girls from the competing Beauxbatons Academy strut by. ""I always like looking at them from behind"" confesses Ron whose thoughts tend to tumble out directly from his id. The dress-up event is just the venue to show what splendid-looking teenagers Grint Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson have grown into. Tweeners are likely to find Radcliffes Harry quite a hunk in a cerebral kind of way accentuated by his trademark glasses. Watson has an Audrey Hepburn moment out of ""Sabrina"" when Hermione makes a late appearance at the ball in a violet dress showing a hint of cleavage. Although Harry and Ron assumed Hermione was lying about having a date shes on the arm of the handsomest competitor representing the Bulgarian team. Grints face instantly reflects Rons torn feelings about Hermione -- is she just a gal pal and if so why is he so clearly jealous? Theres a subliminal suggestion that Harrys fierceness competing for the Triwizard cup the equivalent of going for the gold could be motivated by impressing Hermione or another Hogwarts girl hes taken a shine to. Even more than a wand winning could transform them into his first groupies. Technically too young to qualify for the tournament Harry is shocked to see his name spit out by a magic goblet the final arbiter in such matters. How he came to be the second Hogwarts student to be picked when the competitors are limited to one per school is skimmed over in the movie. But as readers of the book know malevolent forces are at work in Harrys selection. Of the three trials that make up this triathlon for wizards the one where they navigate a maze is the most visually striking. It appears to stretch on forever broken up by mist so thick you can practically feel the dampness. Harry Potter doesnt go over to the dark side. But ""The Goblet of Fire"" sure does. Even the outdoor scenes take place on cloudy days. The first ray of sunshine doesnt filter through until almost the end glimpsed through the rooftop of the great hall Hogwarts magnificent assembly room. Badly in need of some lightening up the movie gets it from several comic characters led by tabloid reporter Rita Skeeter. When Rowling conceived Skeeter book critics speculated that she was lashing back at the press for being so intrusive. The marvelous Miranda Richardson tears into the role forcing herself upon Harry after hes the surprise winner of the first round. Rita already has her angle The lad is motivated by the long-ago murder of his parents. Scribbling furiously with a quill pen she twists Harrys words to conform to the story in her head. The following day Harry reads with dismay about how ""his eyes were swimming with the ghosts of his past."" Brendan Gleeson also is quite funny as Alastor Moody a new Hogwarts professor shown continually imbibing from a flask of whisky. Hes asked to keep an eye on Harry the joke being that Moodys eye roams all over the place. He looks like Marty Feldman in ""Young Frankenstein."" The rest of the grown-ups in the cast the cream of British actors arent given nearly enough to do. Michael Gambon continues as Professor Dumbledore having taken over the role from the late Richard Harris. As the evil Voldemort Ralph Fiennes appears even less often. ""Goblet of Fire"" fills the screen and keeps you riveted to your seat throughout with the complexity and wit of the story which despite necessary trims stays true to the arc of the book. Its grand filmmaking aided as all spectacle movies are these days by computer-generated effects. The CGI is not always 100 percent the way you came to expect in ""Lord of the Rings."" When the Bulgarian team arrives at Hogwarts on a ship no ripples can be seen disturbing the water pattern. But there are ripples of another nature which will surely turn into waves when ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is brought to the screen. Toward the end of ""Goblet"" Hermione asks Harry ""Everything is going to change isnt it"" concern registering in her voice. ""Yes"" he replies with the broadest of grins. -- Advisory This film contains scary scenes and extremely mild sexual references.

The movie also opens in IMAX format Friday at Pacific Science Centers Boeing IMAX Theater; see www.pacsci.org for more information. Coming up Kids reviews The six winners of our ""Harry Potter"" contest chime in with their reviews of ""Goblet of Fire"" on Saturday in Northwest Life and here online. The new ""Harry Potter"" movie begins with the franchises familiar music theme played in a chilling minor key and ends with the camera panning into a rather cloudy and ominous sky. These are indeed dark days at Hogwarts where being 14 isnt just giggles and pimples -- for young Harry Potter it means risking his life in the Triwizarding Tournament only to ultimately face his demonic nemesis Voldemort. Perhaps kids in the real world who will flock to this film like wizards to a Quidditch tournament might think of Harrys plight when next tempted to complain about homework. As were quickly learning throughout this series life is tough when youre a famous kid wizard. Not so tough though for an audience member -- the ""Harry Potter"" franchise now on its fourth film and third director continues in ripping good form. (Directing these films its turning out is kind of like being a Hogwarts Defense Against the Dark Arts professor -- a high-profile yet mysteriously brief gig.) Mike Newell at the helm this time is this very British series first British director following Chris Columbus and Alfonso Cuaron and he takes to it like a duck to water. Theres a to-the-manor-born poshness to this film that feels just right from the newly upgraded Gryffindor Common Room (drenched in red velvet it looks like a Pottery Barn version of Buckingham Palace) to the endless rows of toast racks at the Hogwarts breakfast table. For this crowded film the now-familiar regulars are joined by a host of newcomers. Hogwarts here plays host to a pair of rival schools both of whom make spectacular entrances into the schools now-familiar Great Hall. The all-girls Beauxbatons Academy whose pretty members wear sky-blue costumes and huffy expressions look like leggy 30s-movie chorines; the manly fellows of Durmstrang Institute punch a rhythm with their walking sticks and turn random cartwheels like a road company of ""Stomp."" From these ranks come Beauxbatons Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy) and Durmstrangs Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) who join Hogwarts Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) to battle dragons evil mermaids and a vast mist-shrouded maze in which as the august Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) warns ""people can change."" Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" with Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint Emma Watson Ralph Fiennes Michael Gambon Brendan Gleeson Robbie Coltrane Alan Rickman Maggie Smith. Directed by Mike Newell from a screenplay by Steve Kloves based on the novel by J.K. Rowling. 157 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images. Several theaters. The tournament combined with some comic relief in the form of the angst-ridden Yule Ball takes up much of the fourth year at Hogwarts for Harry Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson). And some new faces haunt the Hogwarts halls. Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher skulks around taking slugs from a flask gazing at Harry with a tethered eye that clearly has a life of its own. Muckraking reporter Rita Skeeter (a very funny Miranda Richardson) stalks Harry in search of fodder for her column licking her teeth like a satisfied cat when she finally corners him. While much of this is comic overall ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" takes a tone even darker than its somber predecessor ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."" Much has been made of the films PG-13 rating -- the first in the series -- and its well-deserved. Parents should think carefully before bringing young or easily frightened children. The ultimate appearance of Voldemort (played by an especially reptilian Ralph Fiennes) is quite terrifying and the meticulous realism of the dragons in a gray gladiatorlike pit makes you genuinely fear for poor Harrys life. But this is as it should be as J.K. Rowlings series marches resolutely to its ultimate showdown between good and evil. The audience is growing older as are the young stars Radcliffe Grint and Watson (who gets a lovely Cinderella-on-a-staircase scene at the Yule Ball) are more confident than ever in front of the camera. Radcliffe in particular now has the chops to carry a movie. Steve Kloves screenplay sometimes feels a bit too lickety-split (though hes made some wise cuts particularly the tiresome house-elf subplot) but Radcliffe now seems able to take his time to let an emotion develop. Hes a boy who holds the weight of the world and an actor who holds the weight of a franchise and he carries both with a reluctant ease. Though the special effects in this film are often breathtaking the real drama is here is exactly where it should be in a young mans frightened but resolute eyes.

Warner Bros. So do the legions of readers of J.K. Rowlings clever books and hordes of movie audiences. And they will probably love it as much as ever after seeing this film which opens in many markets late tonight and nationwide Friday. Its hard to beat the last movie Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and this film is not better but it has much to recommend it. It was a more ambitious book to condense into a movie given its 734 pages and dense plot. Its scarier than the previous three movies and more poignant. The young characters are becoming more complex having aged from 11 to 14. Hence there is more humor and opportunity for intriguing interpersonal dynamics (read teen angst and romantic yearnings). But its still a Harry Potter movie with plenty of eye-popping special effects and edge-of-your-seat action especially because the story centers on the Triwizard Tournament a competition among magical teens from around the world. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is chosen to vie against two foreign competitors and a fellow Hogwarts student Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson). They face horned dragons ominous lake creatures and a mind-bending maze. Portions of the tasks drag and could have used additional editing. When the action isnt focused on tournament face-offs Harry and his pals are facing other demons their own insecurities and fears about the opposite sex. The Yule Ball is a funny and welcome respite from the perilous tournament. The wizarding students dance to the live music of rockers from Radiohead and Pulp. The veteran cast remains strong. Brendan Gleeson does a fine job as the enigmatic ""Mad Eye"" Moody and Miranda Richardson is appropriately eccentric as journalist Rita Skeeter. Ralph Fiennes is a terrifying Lord Voldemort the evil wizard who killed Harrys parents and commands the fearsome Death Eaters. It is his first appearance in adult humanized form and the metamorphosis is chilling. The climactic scene where Harry duels with Voldemort packs an emotional wallop as does Harry sobbing over the body of a competitor. The film is the first directed by a Brit Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral). It doesnt have the rich look of the third film directed by Alfonso Cuaron but the series continues to captivate. The worlds favorite magical trio may be going through an awkward stage but the movie franchise is maturing smoothly. (Rating PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images. Running time 2 hours 34 minutes.)

"Truly magical at last - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | MOVIE REVIEW Truly magical at lastWith the fantasy kicked up a notch and a new director Harry Potter catches Fire.November 18 2005|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer ITS taken them long enough but the movies have finally gotten Harry Potter right. Despite the reported 2.7 billion earned by the series three previous attempts its not until ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" that a film has successfully re-created the sense of stirring magical adventure and engaged edge-of-your-seat excitement that has made the books such an international phenomenon.Viewed as a whole the Potter movies are shaping up to be a fascinating experiment in big-budget filmmaking. Using the same J.K. Rowling source material the same screenwriter (the excellent Steve Kloves) largely the same cast but a variety of directors the Potter pictures have ended up reflecting the sensibility of their filmmaker more than that of the author.With the reliably commercial Chris Columbus in charge the first two Potters were soulless but safe-as-houses copies of the books.The gifted Alfonso Cuaron attempted to escape the bonds of the conventional in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" but succeeded only in part.It has fallen to the veteran Mike Newell eager in his own words ""to break out of this goody-two-shoes feel"" to make the first Harry Potter film to be wire-to-wire satisfying.Newell is an impeccable craftsman with four decades of cinematic experience a veteran less concerned with projecting a lofty auteur sensibility than giving the best of his films from the chilling ""Dance With a Stranger"" to the comic ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" what they need from a practical point of view.The first thing the Hertfordshire-born Newell has added to the mix is a welcome sense of ownership of the books setting. Having been a boarding school boy himself Newell the series first British director displays a comfort level with the world of Hogwarts that comes with knowing it in his bones.Newell works equally well with the preexisting cast and the films new British actors principally a convincing Ralph Fiennes as the dread Lord Voldemort a comic Miranda Richardson as weaselly journalist Rita Skeeter and best of all Brendan Gleeson as the irrepressible Mad-Eye Moody the latest in Hogwarts notably eccentric series of Defense Against the Dark Arts instructors.The presence of Voldemort in the creepy-crawly flesh signals that this is the first Potter movie to have a PG-13 rating for ""sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images."" Fortunately ""Goblet"" is not an R-rated movie trying to pass as something tamer but a genuine PG-13 pleasantly shivery but in no way savage or sadistic.Newell also proves to be adept at bringing a feeling of page-turning propulsion to a grittier than usual narrative that courtesy of one of the series better plots is rife with convincing jeopardy situations.The danger starts at the Quidditch World Cup where the festivities are marred by rioting by Voldemorts Death Eaters and the appearance of his Dark Mark in the sky.That Quidditch match the 422nd to be exact is also the first tipoff as to how special ""Goblets"" special effects are going to be. The enormous stadium where the match is held seems appropriately both in and out of this world and it sets the stage for a series of magical moments -- including the magnificent Durmstrang sailing ship rising out of the lake and the dozen winged horses drawing the gigantic Beauxbatons carriage -- that are to come.When Harry says ""I love magic"" we can see just what hes talking about.The wizarding schools arriving by ship and coach have come to Hogwarts for the legendary Triwizard Tournament -- ""eternal glory awaits the winner"" promises headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) -- that is the spine of ""Goblets"" plot and the excuse for considerable amounts of magic and excitement.Through a series of unlikely events Harry gets to participate in the tournament and has to contend with a trio of exceptionally daunting tasks. The young wizard has to perform heroically underwater deal with a claustrophobic mind-altering maze and evade a terrifying Hungarian Horntail dragon so realistic that the films ""No dragons were harmed in the making of this film"" disclaimer in the closing credits seems more valid than tongue-in-cheek.""Goblet of Fire"" was the first Potter novel to weigh in at the whopping 600-page-plus length that has become standard and though many events have been eliminated including those always irritating house elves ""Goblet"" the film is still longer than it should be at two hours and 34 minutes.Ripe for cutting is the pictures weakest element its exploration of the agonies of early teen dating and friendship. The films heart simply is not in questions like how long Ron (Rupert Grint) and Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) will stay mad at each other and a little romantic awkwardness among 14-year-olds goes an awfully long way.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESHarrys back and children must be braveJuly 16 2005Harry Potter No. 5 preview is on the blockNovember 22 2002Mattel Wins Contract for Harry Potter ToysFebruary 11 2000Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/18/entertainment/et-harrypotter18,200,harrypotterandthegobletoffire21,harrypotterandthegobletoffire,latimes

Liam Lacey From Thursdays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Nov. 17 2005 1200AM EST Last updated Tuesday Mar. 17 2009 550PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Directed by Mike Newell Written by Steve Cloves Starring Daniel Radcliffe Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes Classification PG Rating 1/2 Death torture humour and even budding eroticism -- now this is more like it. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire the fourth instalment of the hyper-lucrative Harry Potter franchise (2.6-billion and counting) and the first with a Parental Guidance rating is easily the most involving of the movies so far. If the first three movies adapted from J. K. Rowlings culture-rocking childrens series felt in various ways like grandiose pop-up-book accompaniments to the novels heres an emotionally realistic core and a playfulness to balance the borderline bombastic spectacular scenarios. Now 14 Harry is in his fourth year at Hogwarts Academy a teenager with real teenage worries romantic feelings and peer ostracism all exaggerated by his status as a messianic wizard of unusual potential and vulnerability. In keeping with its chronicle of adolescent experience the narrative is both more intense and more deliriously scattered than ever. Radically condensed from Rowlings 734-page opus the movie jumps from climax to climax with scarcely a pause for breath from a night attack on a wizards camp to a cathedral rooftop battle to an underwater rescue. At the same time English director Mike Newell ( Four Weddings and a Funeral) has found a way to hold the series of disparate spectacles together with scenes of real-life teen anxiety and tart humour. Fighting a ferocious mother dragon pales when compared with asking a girl to the Christmas dance. Screenwriter Steve Kloves dispatches the first couple of hundred pages of Rowlings novel in a brief eventful prologue to the main story The movie begins with a dream-vision of Harrys involving a meeting in a dark house and a snake. He wakes and is soon on his way with Hermione (Emma Watson) and the Weasley family to attend the Quidditch World Cup in a vast modern stadium. That night the wizards tent city is attacked by a gang of ""Death Eaters"" (in Ku Klux Klan-style robes and pointed hats) who havent been seen since Lord Voldemorts disappearance. Voldemorts signature skull and snake emblem appear lit up in the night sky. The main action begins back at Hogwarts Academy at one of the familiar school assemblies. There Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) announces the revival of the long-dormant Triwizard Competition which involves three academies of magic arts. A fire-breathing cauldron spits out the names of the exemplary competitors from each school to engage in three life-threatening tasks From the French team comes the soignee Fleur Delacour from the Bulgarian team the strutting Quidditch ace Viktor Krum and from Hogwarts the handsome upperclassman Cedric Diggory. Then unexpectedly the goblet spits out another name Harry Potter who although underage and unwilling is obliged to participate. The tasks themselves are generic heroic-journey material (dragon-fighting submerging for a rescue a quest in a bewildering maze). They culminate fittingly in a graveyard where Harry is confronted by his nemesis Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes without a nose but in high Shakespearean flight). While these tasks run the gamut of physical terrors -- vertigo drowning disorientation torture -- they bring the adolescent Harry to the edge of adulthood. Whats best is how the archetypal material is integrated with Harrys more mundane teenage problems the ""Harry Potter stinks"" buttons that flourish around the school when hes accused of cheating; his difficulty in asking a girl on a date never mind having Myrtle the ghost climb into the bath with him when hes stark naked. Among the other cruelties at Hogwarts boys are required to bring dates to the annual Yule Ball. Harry is smitten with pretty Cho Chang (Katie Leung with a honeyed Scottish accent) but by the time he has struggled to ask her on a date she has agreed to go to the dance with Cedric Diggory. Ron Weasley pines for Hermione but is too clumsy to ask her out properly. She in turn becomes smitten with Krum the Bulgarian champion. The school dance where Ron and Harry go and ignore their dates represents Harrys most significant failure at any task major or not. The quickness with which his classmates attack Harry seems appropriate in a sense The character is a vessel of destiny more than a person though Daniel Radcliffe has grown as a well-rounded reactive actor. Among the younger group Watson as Hermione is the standout an actress who should continue to make the transition to an adult career. As for the rest of the cast what movie series has had deeper bench strength? Such major actors as Maggie Smith Robbie Coltrane Gambon and Alan Rickman are reduced to a scene or two here. Above all Brendan Gleeson comes close to stealing the movie. As the new Defence against the Dark Arts professor Alastor ""Mad Eye"" Moody with his scarred countenance amputated leg and giant bulging eye he incarnates the macabre humour that lifts Harry Potter IV from a movie for children to a movie that children can also enjoy.

"Movie 4 -- Goblet of Fire Magical realism - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Chandra Levy Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeMovie 4 -- Goblet of Fire Magical realismWizards in training face teen tensions in latest Potter flickBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 11/18/2005 120000 AM PSTUpdated 06/16/2011 022241 PM PDTClick photo to enlargeDaniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson star in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.""<<1>>Of all the terrors that Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) must face in his latest screen adventure -- slithering snakes destructive dragons a hissy Lord Voldemort -- the worst by far is puberty. At 14 he acts much more like a loathsome teenager than the excessively solemn young bloke he often seemed to be in the first three movies of the series. In ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire the young wizard is so often sullen tormented or both that they might just as well have called it ``Goblet of Hormones. Harry even comes with his first more restrictive PG-13 rating which reflects the darker tone of this adaptation of J.K. Rowlings book. None of the four movies in the series is meant to stand apart from the others and because each one is a piece of a much longer more complex narrative they never feel satisfyingly complete. ``Goblet of Fire is no exception although like director Alfonso Cuarons last installment ``The Prisoner of Azkaban the visual magic of the story as well as some enormously welcome glimmerings of humor gives it the solid feel of a well-tended franchise. Its a McMovie meant to serve up the cinematic equivalent of fast food to billions of customers. And if it all seems a little familiar well thats the idea.Advertisement Director Mike Newell (``Four Weddings and a Funeral) deserves credit for continuing the work Cuaron started in overcoming the leaden start the series got under director Chris Columbus who never aimed beyond the books hard-core fans. Newells ``Goblet has the pacing of a good thriller and on top of this is a creamy head of comedy. The director pauses periodically to allow the adult actors a great frothy blow. Thus Miranda Richardson (as gossip reporter Rita Skeeter) Maggie Smith (as Professor McGonagall) and Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) have only about one scene each and yet each manages to make a lasting impression. Best of all is Brendan Gleeson whose Alastor ``Mad-Eye Moody is the schools new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. To say that Moody a kind of personal trainer preparing Harry for the tournament is a man of many parts understates the case considerably. His mechanical eye is a sight to behold as it gyrates through the movie like a hurdy-gurdy dancer. The movie opens with a dream sequence in which Harry sees a snake slither up to Lord Voldemort from behind. A villain so dastardly and so feared that young wizards dare not even say his name aloud Voldemort has not been seen for 13 years since he killed the infant Harrys parents. Now hes back hissing to one of his henchmen ``The boy is everything. The dream leaves Harrys lightning bolt scar -- to say nothing of his imagination -- throbbing. An ominous sign Before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his fourth year he attends the Quidditch World Cup which looks like one of those Renaissance Faires except with jet-powered brooms. But Voldemorts followers the Death Eaters emblazon the night sky with his Dark Mark -- a skull that looks strikingly like the logo for Raider Nation -- an ominous foreshadowing of the trouble still to come. Once Harry is reunited with his classmates Dumbledore the Hogwarts headmaster (played by Michael Gambon) announces that the school will host the Triwizards Tournament. At this the procession of visiting students into Hogwarts Great Hall begins as if it were the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games. The lovely ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy shimmer through the hall on a cloud of sighs from the admiring schoolboys wearing blue uniforms that make them look like 14-year-old flight attendants. They are followed by the brooding boys of Durmstrang Institute and then the names of each schools champion are drawn from the fiery chalice. Harry wants no part of the competition and the Ministry of Magic seems to give him his wish by requiring the competitors to be at least 17. But for some reason Harrys name is spat out of the goblet and he is told he must participate because ``the Goblet of Fire constitutes a binding magical contract. The rest of the movie revolves around the action of the Triwizards Tournament and its social counterpoint the Yule Ball. Harry becomes the rival of Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) in both events vying with the hunky Ced for the affections of Cho Chang (Katie Leung) a Chinese-born Ravenclaw with whose adorable Scottish burr Harry has become besotted. Parental guidance? Much has been made of the PG-13 rating which was not so much forced on the filmmakers as eagerly embraced probably so ``Goblet of Fire could be more aggressively marketed to a teenage audience. There is very little in the movie that the average 8-year-old wont have heard or seen on television or on a game console; in any case Rowlings book was released with no rating of any kind and her millions of under-13 readers seem to have come through it without having their little minds warped. The most notably grown-up thing about the movie is the entrance of Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) at the Yule Ball during which it becomes apparent shes got cleavage. It is one more torment for Harry Potter who probably knows what Dumbledore means when he says ``Soon we must face the choice between what is right and what is easy. `Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Rated PG-13 (sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images) Cast Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint Emma Watson Brendan Gleeson Michael Gambon Director Mike Newell Writer Steve Kloves (based on the novel by J.K.

The wizards-in-training are so caught up with competition on the playing field and dance floor that their minds arent on Potions. Then again they might be thinking about the formula for Love Potion No. 9.Two demons plague Harry in Goblet of Fire - the nefarious Lord Voldemort and puberty. Director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) makes both look equally daunting.Truth be told Harry looks calmer battling the murderer of his parents than he does asking the fetching Cho Chang to be his date for the Yule Ball the Hogwarts prom.With impressive concision screenwriter Steve Kloves condenses J.K. Rowlings brick of a book so that the first 100 pages zip by in 10 minutes of screen time.Harry and friends travel via Portkey (the terrestrial version of a wormhole) to an international Quidditch tourney an event that through Newells eyes resembles a cross between Woodstock and the World Cup with a little Renaissance Faire thrown in for good measure.The first Brit to helm an episode of the series (after American Chris Columbus and Mexican Alfonso CuarAn) Newell builds his story not through ominous set pieces but rather through texture and detail. His enchanted medievalism suffuses cold and forbidding Gothic stone buildings with the comforting warmth and scent of hot mulled cider. He is the guy you want to usher the saga and its stars through the awkward age.Newells film is darker metaphorically and literally than the previous three with fantasy violence and suspense that earned it a deserved PG-13 rating. It is too intense for those under 8.Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) seems to age three years during the course of this 2 1/2-hour film which works to the storys advantage.In the films opening Harry thrashes with a violent nightmare that portends the resurrection of Voldemort. In the next sequence Lord V evidently reanimated scathes the sky with his Dark Mark a chilling prologue to Harrys fourth year at Hogwarts.Although only 14 Harry is chosen by the flaming chalice of the films title to compete in a Triwizard Tournament restricted to students 17 and older. Meeting a challenge thats difficult even for those more mature than you is the theme of the film. Harrys labors which include spiriting a golden egg away from the nest of a horned dragon and rescuing beloved ones from the bottom of a seaweed-strangled lake would make Hercules age a decade.Radcliffe looks the part even if he does not bring much emotion to it. For the human factor Newell relies on the vibrant Emma Watson whose Hermione is emerging as the real actor of this teen wild bunch as poised and focused as her hair is flyaway. Of all the younger actors only she delivers something to Newells in-your-face close-ups.Replacing the late incomparable Richard Harris Michael Gambon makes a credible Dumbledore impersonator though he lacks Harris mirth and twinkle.Sure-footed in its buildup Goblet of Fire stumbles in its climax. What we cant see scares us more than what we can see. Too bad Newell details Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) in all his hairlessness and noselessness. He is reptilian but not repulsive less resembling the repository of evil than a casualty of plastic surgery who overdid the depilation and rhinoplasty.Fortunately the film recovers from this anticlimax enough to hope that Newell returns for another episode of the remaining three.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Harry Potter Movies Entertainment News Mike Newells ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" the fourth film based on J.K. Rowlings popular but not easily categorized series of novels may be likely to inspire admiration rather than warm affection at least while youre watching it. There are stretches where Newells picture even as it radiates thoughtfulness and integrity feels more methodical than magical. He and screenwriter Steve Kloves (who also adapted the first three Harry Potter pictures) have taken great care in streamlining the complicated fbplot of Rowlings novel but even so you can almost hear the gears turning from scene to scene. But I now think ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" may be more like a drug that slips into your bloodstream and takes a few hours to get to work. I didnt sleep well the night after I saw ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" In my dreams the picture reshaped itself into a somber shuddering gray mosaic a solemn reassurance that just as Ive always feared everything is not quite right with the world. ""Goblet of Fire"" nobly faithful to its source material is an end-of-childhood picture Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) now 14 has returned to Hogwarts for his fourth year. The school is to host the Triwizard Tournament an international competition so dangerous its been put on hold for many years. Students from two other wizard schools -- their fancifully descriptive faux-French and bogus-Bulgarian names are Beauxbatons Academy and the Durmstrang Institute -- will visit Hogwarts for the year; one student from each school will be chosen after putting his or her name into the mystical Goblet of Fire to compete in the games. No student under 17 is allowed to even enter. But somehow when the goblet spits forth the names of the chosen contestants Harrys name is among them inciting rancor and resentment among his classmates especially Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) who with Emma Watsons Hermione Granger is one of his two closest friends. Ron is convinced that Harry put his own name into the cup and his jealousy is so great that he refuses to speak to Harry at one point withholding crucial information that could keep Harry from harm. But before long it becomes clear that someone at the school -- we dont learn who until the very end -- put Harrys name into the goblet in the hope that hell be killed during the dangerous proceedings (which include outwitting a vicious dragon to procure a golden Faberge-type egg that contains the clue to the next task). And although were never told as much its obvious that whoever dunked Harrys name in the goblet is a servant of the venomous Lord Voldemort who wants to see Harry killed. ""Goblet of Fire"" is neither as garishly dumb as Christopher Columbus first two Harry Potter pictures ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone"" and ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" nor as lyrical as Alfonso Cuarons beautifully tuned ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."" Cuarons picture was a great romantic fantasy grounded in naturalism and the first Potter adaptation to show any real understanding of its source material. Newells movie is equally faithful to the fourth books tone but its poetry has a completely different texture. This is a brooding somber story a metaphor for the painful segue from childhood to adolescence. It balances the exhilaration of independence -- one of the great joys of growing up -- with the sobering realization that being a grown-up means theres no one around to protect you. Newell begins building that sense of dread in the first scene We see an old man climbing a shadowy flight of stairs and peering into a firelit room where we get a glimpse of a small pale pinched embryo of evil -- Lord Voldemort in his current weakened form -- giving instructions to two of his henchmen his voice a cross between a hiss and a purr. Later Lord Voldemorts mark -- a skull with a swerving snake issuing from its lipless leering mouth -- appears in the night sky tattooed in bold plumes of smoke a signal to his followers that hes preparing for his reemergence into the world stronger than he was before. But none of this is adequate preparation for what happens at the end of ""Goblet of Fire."" To describe the unsettling form Lord Voldemort ultimately assumes -- a shape that Ralph Fiennes with the cunning of a demon himself has poured himself into -- would be tantamount to giving away the end of a thriller. (And ""Goblet of Fire"" is in essence a thriller.) The last moments of ""Goblet of Fire"" also contain a mourning scene thats operatic in scale. Its intensity is overwhelming and it reaffirms the strengths of Rowlings books Like all great childrens literature the Harry Potter novels are really explorations of the ghosts that haunt adults long after theyve grown up and left home -- feelings of longing and loss of vulnerability and the desire for transcendence. Shot in misty gray tones by Roger Pratt (also the D.P. on ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"") ""Goblet of Fire"" has the hushed glow of old silver like a weird treasure thats been locked away in a chest for decades. Its not a particularly pretty movie and leaving the screening I heard one moviegoer grumbling about its being ""in black-and-white."" But its look has the same grudging beauty that once you get used to it English weather does Its so defiant in its grayness that you come to appreciate its conviction. Newell is the first English director to make a Harry Potter movie and if Cuarons vision of Potters world was a dream England Newells is one that vibrates with realism -- nostalgic realism maybe since so much of the pictures imagery has a late 60s vibe. Early in the movie we see a small city of tents set up by the sports fans who have come to see the Quidditch World Cup a scene of pseudo-hippie resourcefulness and bonhomie lifted straight from the 1969 Isle of Wight rock festival. (And then there are the movies small sly rock n roll touches like the psychedelic-looking anti-Harry Potter badges worn by the more resentful students and the Betsey Johnson-style fur-trimmed rock-star coats favored by the statuesque Beauxbatons headmistress Madame Maxime played by English stage actress Frances de la Tour. Theres also a fleeting cameo by Jarvis Cocker the most English of English rock stars since Ray Davies.) You Might Also Like One of the pleasures of the ""Harry Potter"" series is reconnecting with familiar characters and seeing how new ones fit into the mix. ""Goblet of Fire"" brings us Cho the Hogwarts classmate on whom Harry has a crush played with great charm by young Scotswoman Katie Leung She has only a few scenes but theyre lovely. And Brendan Gleeson is Mad-Eye Moody a roughed-up curmudgeonly newcomer to the Hogwarts faculty whos fitted with a fake metal leg and a false eye that rolls around crazily in its artificial socket like a cue ball with a mind of its own. Another of the series pleasures has been watching the actors who play the three leads Radcliffe Grint and Watson grow out of their childish mugging and develop a greater range of subtle emotions. Newell is especially sensitive as Rowling is to that strange underwater period in which girls and boys begin to realize what they want out of life coupled with the miserable recognition that other girls and boys -- sexually elusive maddening creatures that they are -- hold the key. This adolescent bewilderment manifests itself differently in each character Harry like a doofus dribbles water from his mouth when he catches Cho looking at him across the dinner hall; Rons jaw drops when he gets a gander at the twitching bottoms of the Beauxbatons girls (""Bloody hell"" he mutters the only appropriate response); and Hermione most heartbreaking of all can barely contain her frustration that it never even occurs to Ron to ask her to the big Yule Ball. (She ends up going with Durmstrangs star athlete the sullen-sexy Viktor Krum played by Stanislav Ianevski.) The scenes leading up to the dance as well as the event itself may not be the most dramatic scenes in the picture but theyre its emotional center. In spirit theyre a twin to Alex Chiltons great Big Star song ""Thirteen"" which begins ""Wont you let me walk you home from school?/ Wont you let me meet you at the pool?"" before winding its way to ""Wont you tell me what youre thinking of?/ Would you be an outlaw for my love?"" -- as devastating an encapsulation as any of the way in retrospect our first youthful attachments only appear to have been weightless; at the time theyre happening they mean the world. Ron and Harry both rejected by their first choices ask girls they dont really know (very pretty ones at that) and then in their cluelessness ignore them the whole evening. Hermione who makes an entrance in a jaw-dropping satiny evening dress -- a triumph of Jany Temimes costuming the dress makes her look like neither a dumb ingenue nor a tarted-up performer in a dance recital -- conducts herself far more gracefully but at the end of the night frustrated by Rons inattentiveness (and probably by the fact that she wants his attention at all) she plunks herself down on a set of stairs and removes her shoes probably her first grown-up pair which are clearly hurting her feet. Ralph Fiennes Lord Voldemort may be the most deeply disturbing image from ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."" But the movies overall aura of impending change is unsettling in itself. At the end of the picture as Ron Hermione and Harry are about to part for the summer Hermione -- usually so brisk and matter-of-fact -- seems unusually troubled by something. She looks at Harry and blurts out ""Everythings going to change now isnt it?"" Harry reaches out to her and with a little laugh of resignation says ""Yes."" Because everything is going to change. Voldemort is back which is horrible enough by itself. But Hermione earlier than the others have has latched onto a disquieting truth. Shes just realized theyre all on the other side of childhood looking back. Theres nowhere to go but forward. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment.

In the end someone even dies. Yes true to the prerelease hype Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is most definitely not kids stuff -- the film and the lives of its characters have graduated to a PG-13 rating -- and as one who has never read so much as one page of one Potter novel I can only imagine where it all goes from here. (Specifically I imagine a Part 5 in which an antiestablishment Harry blasts gangsta rap out of his iPod and starts referring to Dobby the house elf as ""Shorty."") Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire traces the events leading up to and constituting the storied ""Triwizard Tournament"" a sort of triathlon for magic people pitting Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry against two rival academies -- one consisting entirely of sashaying French schoolgirls the stuff of many a schoolboy fantasy; the other an army of burly grunting Eastern European bodybuilder types (also the stuff of schoolboy fantasies). As for the titular burning chalice it will magically select the names of the three wizards -- one from each school -- worthiest of the Triwizard competition. Theres just one catch Competitors must be at least 17 years of age which makes 14-year-old Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) ineligible. The End. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Well not exactly. Believe it or not by the time Goblet of Fire reaches the terminus of its two-and-a-half-hour running time Harry hasnt just turned the Triwizard Tournament into a four-way affair hes performed beyond all reasonable expectation. Someone you see has a vested interest (and hardly a benevolent one) in making sure young Harry survives this arsenal of fearsome challenges.The Tournament itself makes for an engaging spectacle sure to rekindle fond audience memories of childhood intramural athletics Harry does battle with a fire-breathing dragon at one point nimbly chasing it around a steep shingle roof then later navigates his way through a shape-shifting hedge maze that can turn entrants nearly psychotic with championship lust. The versatile director Mike Newell (Dance With a Stranger Pushing Tin) whos actually the first native Brit to take a crack at a Potter picture pulls off these effects-intensive sequences with aplomb if admittedly none of the transcendent imagination that Alfonso Cuaron brought to last summers Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban -- still the series best effort. But before the games begin were subjected to a litany of tedious pre-show entertainments including the Quidditch World Cup (which Im told takes up more than 100 pages of Rowlings book) the Yule Ball (Hogwarts version of a homecoming dance) and a tentative romance between the giant Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and the equally formidable Madame Olympe Maxime (West End grande dame Frances de la Tour) headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy. All of which while reasonably amusing feels like something that the Potter films have thus far been free of -- a marking of time.And Goblet of Fire is disappointing on other counts too. For the second in their series of obstacles the Triwizard contestants must rescue from the icy Black Lake a close friend (in Harrys case Hermione) who has been abducted rendered unconscious and deposited in the boggy depths by the tournament coordinators. Its a scenario whose unfathomable cruelty neither Newell nor veteran series screenwriter Steve Kloves seems fully prepared to confront. Nor do they seem any surer what to make of the weirdly jealous behavior shown toward Harry by his best mate Ron (Rupert Grint) in the wake of Harrys ascendant celebrity. (By the time Ron stops speaking to Harry out of wounded pride adolescents in the audience may wonder if theyre watching an adaptation of not J.K. Rowling but rather that staple of every middlebrow middle school education John Knowles.)I suppose what Im getting at is that adolescence is no less sticky a situation for multibillion-dollar movie franchises than it is for young witches and wizards and what is a Part 4 if not the cinematic equivalent of those awkward tween years? More often than not at this point in a series novelty wears thin and reinvention abounds -- Jason Voorhes bites the dust Jar Jar Binks takes center stage and the crew of the Starship Enterprise plops down in San Francisco Bay -- to varying degrees of success. So why not a little teen angst for Harry and company especially when the actors own gangly growth spurts (particularly Grints) have caused them to resemble oversize Alices traipsing through toy-box wonderlands? Purists of course will point out that this is all derived verbatim from Rowlings 700-page tome -- and far be it from me to suggest that a movie should succeed on its own terms.For this viewer Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire came alive only in the presence of a supposed dead man -- specifically the nefarious Lord Voldemort who brought the lives of Harrys parents to their untimely ends some 13 years ago left Harrys forehead emblazoned with its distinctive lightning-bolt scar and now guides his young archnemesis toward a fateful showdown. Resurrected here in the form of a nearly unrecognizable Ralph Fiennes ashen of complexion and devoid of hair and nose Voldemort is like a primeval poltergeist loosed from the deepest recesses of childhood paranoia. From the moment he appears onscreen three-quarters of the way into the picture I was as if a child again shivering under my bed covers from some gruesome night terror; then the lights came up and like the teenage Harry I found myself all too abruptly returned to a world where there are things far graver than nocturnal phantoms.

With Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint Emma Watson Brendan Gleeson Ralph Fiennes Michael Gambon. Director Mike Newell (237). PG-13 Fantasy violence and frightening images. 3.5 Stars. Theres a delicious chill in the air at Hogwarts this semester. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is the darkest most thrilling entry yet in the movie franchise based on novelist J.K. Rowlings magical creation - the boy wizard from whom so much is expected. In his fourth year at Hogwarts a time when Nazi-like ""Death Eaters"" are on the march Harry is forced to fight gladiator-style in a deadly intramural competition the Triwizard Tournament. A dragon breathes fire down his neck while a dragon of a different sort - the evil presumably vanquished Lord Voldemort - makes Harrys lightning-shaped scar pulse with foreboding. Theres plenty of humor but the primary mood in ""Goblet"" is one of terror with a dense intense story and dazzling action sequences - an airborne dragon fight an eerie underwater rescue. Just as Harry has grown the series has graduated to a PG-13 rating one that parents should heed - this movie is giving me nightmares. Theres something else bothering Harry and his pals Ron and Hermione something more unpredictable than shape-shifting mazes possibly more frightening than the resurrection of He Who Shall Not Be Named The stirrings of puberty. Thats some serious magic. The power of hormones is pretty clear. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) look mighty mature for 14-year-olds. Grints growth spurt will have him towering over the giant Hagrid pretty soon - hes already speaking in a manly rumble that threatens to crack the schools foundations. Meanwhile Hermione puts the boing back in bookworm. Expertly directed by Mike Newell this ""Harry"" is a worthy successor to last years installment by Alfonso Cuaron. ""Goblet"" shifts effortlessly from dark to light to dark again. Ralph Fiennes plays a newly invigorated but nostril-challenged Voldemort and Gary Oldmans face appears in the ferocious embers of a fire as Harrys confidant Sirius Black. Even the light is a bit dark. Harry gets his best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher yet - Alastor (Mad Eye) Moody played by a fabulously cranky Brendan Gleeson with a scowl for the record books and a fake eyeball that rolls restlessly like a dog pulling at its masters leash. Just when things are looking mighty hairy for Harry the movie takes a comic breather in the trenches of young love. Harry is poetry in motion on the Quidditch field but when the girl he likes catches his eye he does a spit-take worthy of the Three Stooges. The simple act of asking a girl to the school dance causes sweat to pool and friendships to rupture. Director Newell decorates the Hogwarts Yule Ball with the romantic-comedy tinsel he perfected in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" There are also some wonderful bits with Miranda Richardson as a purring gossip columnist with a poison pen and the usual delightful crew of Alan Rickman Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane. Rowlings books have kept pace with Harrys journey from an adorable misunderstood orphan with special abilities to a teenager who feels the heavy burden his abilities entail. Hogwarts teaches magic but the aim of the curriculum - and the books and the movies - is to teach young minds how to wield knowledge and power responsibly. As the wise headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) says life is ""a choice between what is right and what is easy."" This new Harry Potter movie makes things right even if - as Harry and pals nervously acknowledge at the end - everything will be different from now on.

By Rex Reed  11/21/05 1200am The story goes that when he was being wheeled into the brain surgery that led to his death the legendary jazz drummer and big-band icon Buddy Rich was asked by the attending nurses if he was allergic to anything. ""Yes"" he barked rising from his gurney ""country music"" Since I pretty much feel the same way its difficult to appreciate all of the thumping twang that pours out of Walk the Line the new biopic about the troubled songs and hardscrabble times of Nashvilles man in black Johnny Cash. But its not the music that disappoints. Its the curious fact that for a man so revered a movie about his life should be so unexceptional. After it premiered at this years Toronto International Film Festival one wag called it ""a perfect example of how to make genius look mundane."" Too bad weve seen what marvels can be distilled from using real people as thematic material in movies like Ray Capote and Kinsey to name a trio of recent triumphs in the biopic genre. The trouble with Walk the Line is that it lacks the drama to keep us riveted and involved. It comes alive only when Joaquin Phoenix (as Johnny Cash) and the delectable Reese Witherspoon (as his second wife June Carter) dump their scripts grab their guitars and belt out the Johnny Cash songbook. Theyre both excellent and do some mighty fine singing too. But where is the conflict that makes us care if they win or lose? The rags-to-riches saga of country-blues-rock star Johnny Cash follows a predictable pattern poor childhood abusive father struggles with insecurity and substance abuse and the long pursuit of perky June who resisted him for years. He was a womanizing pill-popping drunk and so what? That just makes him a stock character. Not so different in fact from Ray Charles but director Taylor Hackford and star Jamie Foxx did so much more to bring that story into focus than director James Mangold has done here. We get the rough Arkansas adolescence in 1944 the long days of picking cotton in 104-degree heat the guilt over the accidental death of his brother the escape that came with a stretch in the U.S. Air Force in Germany in 1952 the miserable first marriage in Memphis while working as a door-to-door salesman to support his wife and baby the first music gigs in Texas (sponsored by Purina poultry and livestock feed) the early concerts with Elvis Roy Orbison and Jerry Lee Lewis. By 1958 Cashs emotional and financial troubles found him lost in a dissipated haze of girls and drugs fueled by an unrequited obsession with June Carter already a country star with two failed marriages behind her and no intention of getting involved with another loser. Flirting with each other while hiding their growing feelings offstage then exploding with chemistry in the spotlight their love story was a tortured one and Im sorry to say not entirely cliche-resistant. The crux of the film is Cashs downfall and then the way he pulled his life together and found redemption with Junes help. In 1968 they were married and they played and loved together for the next 35 years. (The woman who saved his life died in 2003.) According to the film contrary to the publicity that overshadowed his life Cash was arrested only once for hiding drugs in his guitar. He never did time in Folsom Prison although the famous ""live"" concert he recorded there against the wishes of Columbia Records is briefly shown. Mr. Phoenix shows some of Cashs dark dangerous appeal but hes saddled with a disjointed simplistic script that reins him in every time he plunges out of the starting gate. Ms. Witherspoon as the vivacious daughter of country musics First Family is larky touching and vibrant. Unfortunately every time the two stars come close to communicating the film cuts to Cashs unstable distractions with barbiturates amphetamines and groupies. Settling for a polished shine instead of the gritty edge that would have given it more substance the film fails to explain why Johnny Cash was considered the pioneer outlaw of country music. He seems neurotic but tame to me and strikes no new chords in Walk the Line. Goblets of Ire First sentence of the press notes at the critics screening ""Difficult times lie ahead for Harry Potter"" You can say that again. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire the fourth and most boring entry in the franchise Harry and pals battle not only the dark side but the horny side. As Harry turns 14 16-year-old Daniel Radcliffe is pushing the envelope. With hairy legs a bulge in his pants an Adams apple and some odd makeup that proves even wizards get acne the evidence indicates that as Harry and his pals start a new year at Hogwarts they have become hormonally challenged before their time. Thats not all. For one thing the new movie runs over two hours and 30 minutes which is entirely too long for adults and out of the question for children. It is also so pretentious convoluted and confusing that grown men were standing around in groups after it ended asking ""Did you understand it?"" and more bluntly ""What the f-- was that?"" Worst of all this movie is so violent youd have to be a sadist to send children off to watch the ghastly things that Harry is subjected to here. Stabbed burned beaten and tortured with corpses piling up around him in every scene Harry never sustains a bruise and never breaks his glasses but still. Of course Harrys never-ending search for the monstrous Lord Voldemort continues. This evil villain has been killed off so many times there is nothing left but Swiss cheese but he returns surrounded by henchmen chanting like the Ku Klux Klan. Hes also been played by so many actors we wouldnt know him if he rang the bell pretending to be the welcome wagon. (This time the thankless job goes to Ralph Fiennes.) But Im getting ahead of myself. Still suffering from blinding migraines that produce nightmares of the future Harry and his fellow witches Ron (Rupert Grint who finds out girls can do more than turn boys into mice) and Hermione (who sports cleavage already) are temporarily distracted by the Quidditch World Cup a cross between Disney World and a Renaissance fair with a magic show on flying broomsticks. The party is ruined by a fire set by the maniacal Death Eaters Lord Voldemorts conehead slaves who havent been seen since the night he murdered Harrys parents 13 years ago. Back at school safety is in short supply when Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) announces that Hogwarts will host the Triwizard Tournament a series of dangerous life-threatening magic competitions that will determine the greatest student champion in the world over the age of 17. From the imposing goblet of fire in the title three names will spew forth determined by the gods. Although Harry never entered his name and is too young to compete anyway his name mysteriously belches out of the flames breaking all the rules and making four contestants instead of the traditional three. His own resentful classmates turn against him accusing him of arrogance and vanity. Ron passes out badges that say ""Potter Stinks"" Terrified Harry has no choice but to compete. (By this time I was looking at my watch--another hour and a half to go.) Whoever put Harrys name in the goblet wants him dead and the rest of the movie spends an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out who did it. Yawn. Bring on the tasks. First Harry must face a fire-breathing flesh-eating dragon and steal its golden egg without being chomped or burned alive. Next Harry must strip down to his bikini and save his friends from becoming underwater bait for killer mermaids and giant calamari. The third challenge is a horrifying maze in which everything changes shape and Harry is ripped shredded and torn spurting enough blood to give children screaming nightmares. But this movie threatens never to end Lord Voldemort returns from Hell in a cemetery surrounded by coneheads Harrys one-eyed mentor (Brendan Gleeson) is taken over by the Death Eaters and somehow everyone miraculously shows up fresh as daisies for Graduation Day. Here at last is a spark of hope graduation Does this mean the end of all this twaddle? Get real. Not while theres all that weekly allowance money just waiting to be forked out of all those adolescent pockets into J.K. Rowlings bank account. O.K. I confess Im too old to properly assess any more adventures of Harry and his computerized enemies. None of it would make much logical sense even to Margaret Hamilton. Ive grown weary of all the jack-o-lantern grins and Halloween costumes. And although Steven Kloves a fine writer who is trashing his talent all the way to the bank is still turning out the scripts the directors just get worse. Chris Columbus directed the first two and Alfonso Cuaron hopelessly misguided the third. Goblet of Fire is in the calloused hands of Mike Newell (Enchanted April Four Weddings and a Funeral) who may have a unique way with adult comedy but who seems to positively hate children. There is precious little humor here and no sense of timing cohesion or control. The attempts to give everyone a love interest including Hagrid the hairy troll just squirm with embarrassment. Id like to put one of Maggie Smiths spells on whoever decided romance was the antidote to trick or treat. ""Dark and difficult times lie ahead"" Professor Dumbledore announces ominously at the end with a promise in his voice of things to come that sounds more like a threat. This is where I came in. And exactly where I want to get off. Mother-Son Act Real talent subtlety grace and craft are in such short supply in todays music that when all four qualities are found in one cabaret act I am tempted to genuflect. Thats why I urge you to experience the abundance of riches in the Algonquins Oak Room this week where veteran vocal stylist Sandy Stewart and the brilliant jazz pianist Bill Charlap are creating an ambiance very close to ecstasy. Laid-back but never sleepy this marvelous duo swings on Valium on ""Taking a Chance on Love"" then rocks with finger-snapping rhythmic fury on a cornucopia of Gershwin classics that take your breath away. Her voice and his piano are the best cold-weather autumnal combination since hot cocoa and melted marshmallows. Her throaty whisper and his elegant keys talk to each other. Well why not? Shes his mom and theyve been communicating since he was in diapers. A singers singer Ms. Stewart delicately bends notes with exquisite phrasing--cautious careful but never remotely tentative. Sipping each stanza like a hot drink she acts out the subtext of ""It Might as Well Be Spring"" with the moment-to-moment technique of a Method actress. When she leaves the stage momentarily Mr. Charlaps piano wizardry is a show in itself--changing chords with humor building each line in the Rodgers and Hart classic ""The Blue Room"" with a quiet progressive climb to a stunning final chord then blending Cole Porters ""Its All Right with Me"" with Rimsky-Korsakov. From Jerome Kerns ""Remind Me"" to Alan and Marilyn Bergmans ""Where Do You Start?"" the thrilling control of Ms. Stewarts instrument--without any show-off pyrotechnics--is an education in how to break a listeners heart. Separately theyre as good as it gets. Together this rapturous team offers the kind of through-the-keyhole musical intimacy that is unsurpassed in the New York cabaret world. This is profound. This is magic. This is your homework assignment. Rush to the Algonquin and learn something you wont forget.

And as in the book ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" on which this latest and happily satisfying film adaptation is based childhood ends with screams and a final shudder in a graveyard crowded with tombstones and evil.

K. Rowling Harry Potter Explained By POLLY SHULMANDid the first three Harry Potter movies leave you feeling like a Muggle in a world of wizards? (PDF Format 12MB) View Graphic Readers Opinions Forum Movies Enlarge This Image Murray Close/Warner Brothers Rupert Grint left Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe at Hogwarts. This is the second time that Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) now 14 has experienced childhoods end of course as Ms. Rowling and the directors of all four films have reminded us. Orphaned at 1 by the malevolent wizard Lord Voldemort Harry has developed over the years books and films from a sentimental Dickensian figure into a prickly adolescent for whom girls now present almost as serious a problem as the Dark Lord. As those who have cracked the spines of the books know their genius rests as much in Harrys dual identity as in Ms. Rowlings grasp on the fantastic at once susceptibly human and wholly alien a geeky outsider and an awesomely cool kid Harry holds up a mirror to those who curl up with books and congregate in theaters taking flight in their imaginations. As did the last film ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" the new one opens and ends on an ominous note. In ""Azkaban"" a giant tree whacks a bird out of the air both at the start and at the close; in ""Goblet of Fire"" its people who get whacked. These poor creatures are not in the novel but they cleverly bookend ""Azbakan"" setting the stage for the scarier more dire and serious story immediately to follow as well as for the darker stories yet to come. If the world of the first two installments ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" and ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" both directed by the aggressively upbeat Chris Columbus represented some kind of paradise for the boy wizard it was a paradise that we come to see would soon be lost. The slithering snake and shivering caretaker who inaugurate ""The Goblet of Fire"" make it clear that the PG action has been ratcheted up to PG-13. Like his predecessor Alfonso Cuaron who brought new beauty and depth to the series the director Mike Newell embraces the sagas dark side with flair. This time the story pivots on the Triwizard Tournament a competition that finds Harry risking life and limb against three young challengers and a litany of more menacing foes. In between feats of derring-do with digitally enhanced dragons there are dining-room flirtations schoolyard confrontations and a gaggle of visiting girls who line up like so many Madelines only to break ranks like La Femme Nikita. There are also the usual growing pains and somewhat less thrillingly no small amount of teenage angst. Now 16 Mr. Radcliffe pouts reasonably well but has yet to develop the skill to make that pouting feel emotionally substantive. This might pose a serious obstacle for the films but it hasnt yet largely because watching him and his young co-stars - the excellent Rupert Grint as Ron the touchingly earnest Emma Watson as Hermione - grow up onscreen has its dividends. Cinema doesnt just immortalize actors locking them into youth it also solicits our love in a way that books do not since it isnt just the characters we fall for but the actors playing them too. Mr. Radcliffe isnt an acting titan or even one of the Culkins but you root for him nonetheless partly because you want Harry to triumph and partly because there is something poignant about how this actor struggles alongside his character. If the lead attraction remains somewhat unsteady on his feet one of the constant pleasures of the films and one of the benefits of the big Hollywood money behind them has been their pedigreed talent. Among the British sirs dames and quality hams returning to the series are Michael Gambon Alan Rickman Robbie Coltrane Maggie Smith Timothy Spall and Gary Oldman whose brief appearance is sadly little more than a tease. New to the scene are Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter a snoopy journalist who is mainly on hand to remind us that Harry is no longer a child and Brendan Gleeson as the latest addition to the Hogwarts staff Mad-Eye Moody. A man of garrulous temperament and removable parts including a googly eye that he wears like a pirates patch Mad-Eye is a pip. As good as these actors are nothing prepares you for the malevolent force that is Lord Voldemort and the brilliance of the actor playing him Ralph Fiennes. Dressed in a flowing black robe that seems to float off his body rather than hang Mr. Fiennes moves with lissome grace his smooth white head bobbing like a cork on a sea his fluttery hands and feet as pale and bright as beacons. For years the movies have tried to transform this delicate beauty into a heartthrob but as ""Schindlers List"" proved Mr. Fiennes is an actor for whom a walk on the darker side is not just a pleasure but liberation. His Voldemort may be the greatest screen performance ever delivered without the benefit of a nose; certainly its a performance of sublime villainy. Mr. Fiennes enters the film spectacularly if regrettably late whooshing into that crowded graveyard like a Butoh dancer from hell. He brings the film to an unsettling close one that doesnt so much polish off the story as leave it in tatters. Thats to the good of the film and the series since each new story has to satisfy on its own terms as well as prime us for the next installment. If Mr. Cuaron raised the series to a new level with ""Azbakan"" Mr. Newell best known for ingratiating mainstream fare like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and best remembered for the bracing likes of ""Donnie Brasco"" manages to keep his contribution at a similarly high level of enthrallment. The gloom and doom may be less poetically realized but the combination of British eccentricity fatalism and steady-on pluck remains irresistibly intact.""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Appreciably more violent than the first three films this chapter includes two human deaths including that of a teenager.

"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; harry-potter-and-the-goblet-of-fire ) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (United States/United Kingdom 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli The best thing to happen to the Harry Potter movie franchise was for journeyman director Chris Columbus to step down. After turning out adequate adaptations of J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Columbus was replaced by Alfonso CuarA3n for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. With the third movie the Harry Potter saga began to take on a legitimate cinematic life of its own. No longer was it content to regurgitate to content of the source novels. Now with Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) at the helm Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire proves to be the darkest and most ambitious Harry Potter outing to-date. To trim the books massive content down to a reasonable size (the movie is about 2 1/2 hours long sans credits) screenwriter Steve Kloves (who has adapted all four novels) had to do a lot of compression. The resulting production is faithful to its source novel in broad strokes but varies greatly when it comes to the details. The ""regulars"" are all back - a year older and a little wiser. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is having strange dreams and he worries that his arch-enemy Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) may be planning a corporeal return. His friend Hermione (Emma Watson) is turning into a beautiful young woman and attracting a fair amount of male attention - a fact that has not escaped the green-eyed notice of Harrys other buddy Ron (Rupert Grint). This year the trios fourth at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry there is to be a ""Tri Wizard Tournament"" in which champion wizards one representing each of three different schools compete against each other for victory. The champions are Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) Fleur Delacour (ClA(c)mence PoA(c)sy) and Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski). Unexpectedly a ""wild card"" is added Harry Potter. The tournament challenges prove to be as potentially deadly as they are difficult and Harry wonders if there are forces aligned against him in a conspiracy. The sides appear to be clearly defined those who stand with Harry - Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) Prof. McGonagall (Maggie Smith) Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher Prof. Moody (Brendan Gleeson) - and those who stand against him a Prof. Snape (Alan Rickman) Draco and Lucius Malfoy (Tom Felton and Jason Issacs) Wormtail (Timothy Spall) and Barry Crouch Jr. (David Tennant). Yet all may not be as it initially seems. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire contains good qualities and not-so-good ones although the former greatly outnumber the latter. This is the best of the quartet of Harry Potter features but it is not without flaws. This movie is more action-oriented than its predecessors with several exciting sequences (most notably a battle with a dragon and an underwater skirmish with pissed-off mermaids) but I will admit to being let-down by the way in which the film culminates. As high points go this one is anticlimactic. (This is a case of something working much better on the written page than on the screen.) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a dark stylish motion picture. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is not as stylish but is darker. Unlike the previous installment this movie focuses primarily on the students allowing many of the adults little more than walk-on cameos. (Alan Rickmans Professor Snape for example has only a handful of lines and is largely MIA.) The PG-13 rating is warranted. This is the movie in which the series transitions from something for kids to something for teenagers and young adults. In developing the storyline Kloves walked a tightrope. Certain apparent irrelevancies were retained in order to keep readers (who make up the majority of the film-going audience) happy. Additional cuts might have made for a tighter better-paced movie but a compromise had to be struck. The resulting movie occasionally drags but its not so protracted that the non-reader will become impatient. Some familiarity with the world of Harry Potter is necessary either through the books or movies. As befits the fourth chapter of a longer saga this is not a stand-alone episode. With the exceptions of a Quiddich stadium and a dragon the film is lean on splashy special effects. Thats not to say CGI is used sparingly but the films look is less ostentatious than that of its predecessors. Its more intimate and real and that enhances the immediacy of the menace. The black cloud hanging over Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has darkened and lowered for this installment. No doubt the storm will break in about two years when Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix reaches multiplexes. For actors Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson and Rupert Grint this is an awkward time. Like their characters they are struggling through the transition from childhood to young adulthood. None of these three is seasoned and there are times when their performances betray their lack of experience. Nevertheless acting limitations aside Radcliffe Watson and Grint have become Harry Hermione and Ron and it would be a shame to replace them for any reason even if the replacements were more talented and skilled. If they are willing let them stay until 2010 or 2011 when the final Harry Potter movie will reach the screen. Of the returning adults only Michael Gambon has too many lines to count. The others show up in a few scenes but are used primarily as background dressing. Brendan Gleeson plays Professor Alastor Moody a new teacher. He has plenty of screen time which allows us opportunities to stare at his free-floating left eyeball. Another newcomer is David Tennant (who recently landed the lead role in the BBC-TV revived series Doctor Who) who gets to imitate a rabid dog in human form. Finally theres Ralph Fiennes whose Voldemort is surprisingly low key. I was disappointed by the way in which Fiennes chose to portray the evil wizard. Voldemort doesnt seem all that ominous. In fact he seems a little boring. This may be the case of the henchmen being more sinister than the master. Four down three to go. With each new Harry Potter movie the stakes are elevated. Director Mike Newell has given the series a fresh look without undoing the ground work established by his predecessors. In the realm of fantasy adventure Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a strong entry. Although the series as a whole falls short of what Peter Jackson achieved with The Lord of the Rings it creeps closer with each new entry (of the four Harry Potter pictures there hasnt yet been a weak one). And it wont be possible to assess the series as whole until all seven movies are available. Until then let me write that Harry Potter has become a rare cinematic constant - something to be anticipated every year or two. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is imperfect but magical nonetheless.

Hermione breathlessly asks Harry near the end of their fourth adventure ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."" Really? Because not much has changed so far. Theres always a new prof an elaborately staged sporting contest that doesnt really have much to do with anything a scary climactic journey through a life-sized puzzle and finally a big revelation that all has not been what it seemed. Harry Potter is a Dickensian orphan in a Scooby-Doobious plot. Count me among those just mild about Harry. The all-out cuteness of the Hogwartsians with their Pufnstufs and Whiffenpoofs is fine for people of developing minds but the story so often stops its forward motion to take us on long detours into the land of CGI effects that it amounts to a 150 million magic show. Still Harry IV - the first to get a PG-13 - is exactly what fans are looking for offering eye-boggling spectacle and lots of well-executed action scenes. The long-awaited appearance of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) creates a satisfying sizzle of evil and there is a startling image of Harry on an underwater chase being confronted with the lifeless bodies of his friends while evil sprites - Sea Monkeys gone bad - try to drag him to his doom. When he negotiates a hedge maze like the one in ""The Shining"" the shrubs turn nasty and aggressive payback time for all that pruning. Perhaps the most charming interlude investigates the dark arts behind conjuring up a first date. Harry is under the spell of Cho Chang (Katie Leung who won the part at an open audition) and listening to her soft Scottish accent who wouldnt be? Though underage Harry is nevertheless selected by the Goblet of Fire - a sort of Big Gulp of Sterno - to join three older kid magicians in a series of bizarre and punishing tasks from which he can barely hope to emerge alive. Ladies and gentlemen I have ridden Amtrak on a holiday weekend so I know how he feels. Meanwhile Harrys pal Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint and its a dead heat as to which of those names is more Dickensian) continues his own alarming journey He is morphing into Danny Bonaduce. When he puts on a wine-red robe accented by a white lacy 18th-century fops cravat it amounts to an audition for ""The Partridge Family The Next Generation."" As if there wasnt enough creepy stuff - a campground scene bears a shivery resemblance to one of those Renaissance Faires held off the Garden State Parkway - the new Hogwarts professor is played by Brendan Gleeson a reliable giver or taker of human shish kebabbing in ""Troy"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" who brings the same qualities to the screen that George ""The Animal"" Steele once brought to professional wrestling. This is one of his more human roles; as Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody Gleeson merely has a strapped-on mechanical eye that whirs crazily around his head and a pet flying spider with which he attacks his class. Other new characters include a love interest for Hagrid - a French schoolmistress with a pageboy do who appears to have been modeled on Anna Wintour -and a murderous scaly fire-breathing dragon also modeled on Wintour. There are some nice throwaway lines but otherwise the humor is several degrees short of tepid. When Harry is harassed by a broadsheet journalist - younger readers may not be aware tabloids were once considered the disreputable papers back before the Times started firing its top reporters - her major shtick is to keep calling him 12 when hes 14. In a season that has given us an award-winning ex-""60 Minutes"" producers admission that she saw no need to authenticate the magical National Guard documents she got from a shadowy necromancer just as the muggles were preparing to cast ballots into the national Goblet of Fire your satire has to be a bit sharper than that. The big news is that Fiennes - who as Voldemort emerges nude in a sort of Rodin/Terminator pose - looks like the ferocious offspring of one of the ""Close Encounters"" aliens and an Orc. His black magic gets an extra jolt from a kickline of supporting henchmen. They look like Goth Klansmen who would kill anyone who stands between them and a Marilyn Manson concert. But in an effort to zip through the 75000-page book director Mike Newell shorts us on Fienness screen time. Since nine hours of saga have been leading up to this we want more. Those who secretly root for Slytherin - an underdog if there ever was one - will leave the theater saying ""Thats it?"" -- HARRY POTTER ANDTHE GOBLET OF FIRE [] (Three stars) Fans will gobble it. Running time 157 minutes. Rated PG-13 (fantasy violence frightening images). At the Lincoln Square IMAX the E-Walk the Kips Bay others.

In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" the budding teenage wizards-in-training grapple with incipient romance jealousy and mortality.

This factor alone will prompt another modest dip in franchise B.O. performance. No more kids stuff at Hogwarts. In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" the budding teenage wizards-in-training grapple with incipient romance jealousy and mortality. Last years ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" seemed dark but this excellent fourth film derived from J.K. Rowlings books is the darkest ""Potter"" yet intense enough to warrant a PG-13 rating. This factor alone will prompt another modest dip in franchise B.O. performance as some younger viewers will steer clear at least until homevid release. But pics excitement and quality bode well for sustained fan interest and confidence through the enterprises remaining three installments. Worldwide theatrical gross for the three features stands at a staggering 2.6 billion although totals have dropped with each subsequent film from 974 million for ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" to 879 million for ""The Chamber of Secrets"" to 749 million for ""Azkaban."" After Mexican helmer Alfonso Cuaron elevated the series so considerably last year producer David Heyman gave a second chance to Mike Newell who turned down ""Sorcerers Stone."" Newell becomes the first English director to have a go at Harry and he doesnt let the home team down. The books millions of readers youthful and otherwise will know whats coming the emergence of Lord Voldemort the ubervillain who killed Harrys parents was later sapped of his powers by the tyke but has now concocted an ingenious plan to trap his nemesis at the conclusion of the interschool Triwizard Tournament. Screenwriter Steve Kloves faced with the task of boiling the 734-page book down to manageable length (157-minute running time makes it the second-longest ""Potter"" picture after ""Chamber"") makes short work of Rowlings bloated 157-page prologue devoted to the Quidditch World Cup. In economical fashion pic reels off Harrys nightmare about Voldemorts return his journey to the White Cliffs with Hermione and the Weasleys to attend the match (in an astonishing modern stadium) the fiery assault on the wizards massive tent city by the Voldemorts Death Eaters (outfitted in pointy Klan-style hats) and the threatening apparition of Voldemorts Dark Mark -- a ghostly skull and snake -- in the night sky. After just 14 minutes were back on the Hogwarts Express with the Fourth Years all noticeably taller older and more mature than in the last installment. That this year will be different from all previous years is announced by the arrival of a flying-horse-drawn carriage bearing the French female students of Beauxbatons and the emergence from under the lake of a vintage sailing ship carrying the Middle European boys from Durmstrang. As Dumbledore explains this exercise in international cooperation among wizarding schools is meant to foster the age-old tradition of the Triwizard Tournament a trio of daunting tasks to be undertaken by an exemplary representative from each institution. General acclamation greets the selection of the representatives of the three schools rangy Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts foxy Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons and macho Quidditch ace Viktor Krum from Durmstrang. But the selection of a surprise fourth contestant -- none other than Harry Potter -- creates tremendous consternation as hes underage and seemingly unprepared for the arduous tasks. Even Harry and Dumbledore are upset as no one has a clue who submitted Harrys name for the competition. With so much ground to cover Kloves has had to eliminate many story elements readers may be expecting. Absent or significantly reduced are many of the early films cutesier motifs such as the animated paintings and ghostly inhabitants (with the delightful exception of Shirley Hendersons Moaning Myrtle). The yarn has been streamlined so that even such significant developments as Harry and Rons falling out are compressed. The upside is that the filmmakers keep the narrative screws fastened tight which gives ""The Goblet of Fire"" an intensity that rarely flags. From the creepy desaturated rural opening that recalls David Leans Dickens films to the exceptionally credible integration of effects into the live action Newell tries to find the emotional reality in material that until now has been used more to showcase fantasy and wonder. Altered emphasis requires more of Daniel Radcliffe and he rises to the occasion with a more dimensional and nuanced performance as Harry. Having now passed decisively into adolescence he suggests for the first time there actually may be an actor in him as he seems more aware of and responsive to everything going on around him. Rupert Grints Ron is another matter as the thesp seems caught at an unappealingly awkward stage and must spend much of the time sulking over Harrys and Hermiones perceived slights. And why do Ron and even Harry wear their hair so uncommonly long? Rons flowing red locks in particular all but obscure his face at times and make him look like a ruddy sheepdog. Emma Watsons studious Hermione comes into her own at the fabulous Christmas ball which provides a breather after the first task in which Harry does battle with a fearsome Hungarian Horntail dragon in a gripping sequence that will have small fry ducking for cover. The cross-currents running up to the ball make for a mini teen melodrama with Harry keen on Asian student Cho Ron into Hermione and the latter coy about the identity of her date until she resplendently turns up on the arm of Quidditch ace Krum. Second task is an underwater affair with bizarre creatures that dont measure up to the others on hand while the third is a massive maze that leads Harry to a long-awaited showdown with the renascent Voldemort. Pale hairless and noseless save for nostril slits Ralph Fiennes makes the series villain-of-villains a distinctive monster remorseless and cunning in a climactic scene that does not disappoint and will like the dragon prove frightening to impressionable youngsters. The other memorable addition here is Brendan Gleesons ""Mad-Eye"" Moody this years Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. Brandishing large scars a detachable leg an ever-ready flask an all-seeing zoom-lens false eye and an irascible attitude Moody is one of Rowlings most colorful creations and Gleeson makes him all the more so. Except for Michael Gambons Dumbledore who becomes more central than ever some of the other delightful regulars get reduced screen time including Maggie Smiths McGonagall Alan Rickmans Snape and Robbie Coltranes Hagrid who enjoys a romance with Frances de la Tours Madame Maxime the head of Beauxbaton whos even taller than he. A semblance of Gary Oldmans Sirius Black appears in a scene among burning embers in a fireplace. Miranda Richardson hits mostly obvious notes as the scandal-hungry journalist Rita Skeeter while Roger Lloyd Packs Barty Crouch is a superbly drawn figure a Ministry of Magic official who conjures up an astonishing combination of Neville Chamberlain and -- due to the moustache -- Hitler. David Tennant is fierce as the renegade Barty junior. Technical aspects are of the expected high standard with many hands including production designer Stuart Craig cinematographer Roger Pratt costume designer Jany Temime creature and makeup effects designer Nick Dudman visual effects supervisor Jimmy Mitchell and special effects supervisor John Richardson returning from previous ""Potter"" duties. New to the team are editor Mick Audsley and most conspicuously composer Patrick Doyle who briefly works in themes from previous John Williams scores albeit in a minor dissonant mode but otherwise employs rich strings and a more classical frame of reference to endow this installment with fresh emotional amplification and disturbing undercurrents. Very slowly unspooling end credits run 13 minutes surely somewhere near the record. Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireProductionA Warner Bros. release of a Heyday Films production.
