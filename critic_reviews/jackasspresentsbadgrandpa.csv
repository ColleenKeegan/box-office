"New Country for Old Men On Last Vegas The Counselor All Is Lost and Bad Grandpa << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com New Country for Old Men On Last Vegas The Counselor All Is Lost and Bad Grandpa Courtesy of CBS Films Brad Pitt November 1 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Last Vegas directed by Jon Turteltaub Its easy to forget that nerds and teenagers arent the only moviegoers who want their fantasies indulged. I thought about that watching Morgan Freeman in Last Vegas. As Archie a twice-married Air Force retiree who recently suffered a stroke all Freeman does for his first two or three scenes is sit in an armchair watching television. Hes surrounded by bottles of pills. He looks comfortable. But when a life-long friend Billy (Michael Douglas) puts him on a three-way call with Sam (Kevin Kline) and tells them that hes getting married Archie springs into action. He gets to go to Wonderland. The plan is that theyll fetch their pal Paddy (Robert De Niro) and join Billy in Las Vegas for a bachelor weekend. Archie tells his worrywart son (Michael Ealy) hes going to a church retreat which is a nice irony. Morgan Freeman doesnt go to church. He is church. You go to him. And thats the real pleasure of watching Freeman in this amusing smart-enough comedy He finally has something fun to do. He has played so many totems of virtue cool wisdom and assistance that its almost shocking to hear him bust Douglass balls with such exasperation and goodwill. Veteran director Jon Turteltaub (While You Were Sleeping both National Treasure movies) turns in another commercial contraption here and this one hums along just as efficiently as his others. Hes a specialist in the sort of movies that are more easy than they are good -- easy to watch easy to skip. I saw Last Vegas while sitting next to a guy who seemed to grow more physically ill as the minutes passed. Its far from that bad. For one thing Dan Fogelmans script avoids a lot of what you dread with a movie like this -- that itll pull a fast one and turn Grumpy Old Men into Amour. But no one in Last Vegas dies. No one even grabs his chest in pain. Its a celebration of something the movies never celebrate anymore being old. Some of it is silly. Sam for instance is given a little blue pill and a condom by his wife (Joanna Gleason) and is instructed to rediscover the man she married. Some of the movie is weirdly complicated. Billy and Paddy wind up fighting over the same lounge singer played by an impossibly well-preserved Mary Steenburgen with a knowing ditzy slur. Paddy is mad at Billy for missing his wifes funeral and would seem to have the moral imperative with the singer over his soon-to-be-married friend. But Douglas has been given a golden tan alabaster teeth and hair Moses could part. He has the cosmetic imperative. If Freeman is church Douglas is chintz. Every once in a while the comedy ebbs and a mortal rue shows up. Douglas for instance gets a line or two about what it means to be on the far side of middle age and why old men chase younger people. (He doesnt mention surgical glamour enhancements but he doesnt have to.) It sounds like it hurts Douglas to say these words. But the cheer of this movie will make it a hit. Its silly not dumb. You want to see Morgan Freeman in a perfectly tailored scarlet suit dancing with women and drag queens. Its a spry alive side of him we rarely see and we should savor it. Who knows when hell get to Wonderland again? The Counselor directed by Ridley Scott These are boom times for geezers at the movies. The no. 1 film in the country stars Johnny Knoxville pretending to be a dirty old man and people appear to be interested in experiencing Robert Redford imperiled at sea. Meanwhile the no. 4 movie was written by an 80-year-old and directed by a man whos 75. But The Counselor has the heartless verve of filmmakers half their ages. Its filthy nasty sexy absurd appalling and exhilarating and it succeeds as a musky union of novelist Cormac McCarthys bleakness and Ridley Scotts sense of chic. It opens with sex between Michael Fassbender and Penelope Cruz. Hes a lawyer. Shes his girlfriend. Actually The Counselor opens with them talking about the sex shed like to have. He wants her to tell him what she wants. ""I want you to touch me"" she says bashfully ""down there."" You hear her say that and you say to yourself ""Thats all the old man has? Down there?"" Then she grows specific. Fassbender makes her wish his command. And as he went to town I tried to fasten a seat belt that wasnt there. Loosely what follows is the story of the lawyers punishment for being foolish enough to enter the drug business. Everyone calls him ""Counselor"" but he spends a lot of the film being counseled -- by an elegant Bruno Ganz an exhausted Javier Bardem a smooth Brad Pitt a raw-looking Rosie Perez and a calculating Ruben Blades. They all speak in that insinuating roughhouse poetry of McCarthys. Its a threat and a seduction at the same time. Most of these people are at one end of the drug trade or another. Perez is in prison. Bardem hides himself in nightlife development. His character Reiner provides the Counselor with a semblance of friendship. He fears the intensity of his attraction to his girlfriend (Cameron Diaz) and frets about the vast unknowableness of certain women. But no one here seems trustworthy and it doesnt take long for the Southwestern dirt beneath the Counselors loafers to turn to quicksand. You knew that would happen but the movie ripples out far enough to show a brewing storm that involves strange ruthless secondary characters whose strings are pulled by unseen puppeteers. The prevailing sense of preordained hopelessness death and doom are standard McCarthy. He and Scott are not afraid of the ridiculous the symbolic the telegraphed or the literal. The movie is shockingly hilariously all of these things. I can imagine McCarthy has seen the tastefulness of The Road and the geometrical precision of No Country for Old Men and wanted something lewder and messier for his writing. This is how for example a car windshield gets a hot wax from Diaz while Bardem watches amazed in the passenger seat. That scene makes Tawny Kitaen look like Jessica Tandy. Bardems amazement was mine. The menagerie on display is remarkable. Bardem wears loud prints and big tinted bug glasses and looks as if he survived a nuclear meltdown at the Versace plant. Pitt looks like he sells used Cadillacs in 1986. And then theres Diaz. She finally gets to bring her athletic bimbo powers to bear on a part good enough to show us a welcome hardness and wisdom. The plastic surgeons havent gotten to Diaz yet. Unlike some of the older women in Last Vegas that face of hers can still tell a story. So do her clothes. All the jungle prints and snake skins she wears all the jewels and accoutrements make her exactly what certain men fear in certain women a predator. (Never mind that shes also the loving owner of two fearsome cheetahs a blatancy that would be appalling in a different film.) But you dont watch her flirt and splay herself and fear youre in the hands of misogynists. Its the opposite. The characters here might fear this woman. McCarthy and Scott kneel before her. All Is Lost directed by J.C. Chandor At 77 Robert Redford is still blonde but its an ashen sort of yellow like straw thats been drying for decades in the sun. But the creases and lines in his face havent diminished his handsomeness. Hes still something to see which is a good thing since hes all there is to watch in All Is Lost. He plays a yachtsman who awakens with a start to the sound of a small crash and the sight of water streaming through a gash in his boat. It has hit a wayward shipping container. He spends the movie trying to survive using only his nautical instincts. There are no pirates or aliens. A shark steals his lunch but the foes here are simply weather and time. This is an uncommonly absorbing movie. The director is J.C. Chandor whose previous film the stock market drama Margin Call was notable for a handful of well-wrought speeches. Aside from an apologetic letter Redfords character writes there are about two words in the film ""help"" and ""fuuuuuuuck."" Like Alfonso Cuarons Gravity and Paul Greengrasss Captain Phillips theres a kind of movie magic in play here. Chandor works with equal parts manual rigor existential wonder and circumstantial dread (the score by Alex Ebert gently sounds notes of all three). Of course it doesnt work without Redford. You need a star who doesnt seem ridiculous still slipping into cable knits and other yachtwear in a moment of crisis. You need a star who in doing and saying little gets a lot done. You need a star whose presence compensates for a screenplays narrative economy. Redford goes about the business of keeping himself alive with serious stoicism. You realize youre watching a dying breed of American masculinity. There are no tears. Theres no sentimentality. Theres no Vegas no self-pity. In rooting for this man to endure you arent hoping for the survival of a single star. Youre praying for something greater to last for an entire mode of being in the movies to persist. When Redford and Douglas and Clint Eastwood go all wont be lost. But something great and crucial to the pleasures of the movies will be. Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa directed by Jeff Tremaine Theres a quiet depressing strain that runs through each of these films. Just because no one keels over in Last Vegas for instance doesnt mean you cant sense the defensiveness. Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa on the other hand is a joke on the concept of death. OK its a Jackass production so its a joke on everything. But even by those standards its tenuous as a movie. Johnny Knoxville builds an hour and a half around public pranks involving his old-man character Irving Zisman. The makeup used to transform him is state-of-the-art -- as a moviegoer youre always aware youre watching a young person pretend to be old but you also believe that people on the street have no idea whats going on. All they see is a rude vaguely handsome seventyish man. Freshly widowed Irving is saddled with an estranged grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) a spiky butterball who can curse on command. They drive from Ohio to St. Louis to Tennessee and finally Raleigh where the boy is to be left with a father he doesnt know. Along the way they seemingly spontaneously concoct scenarios to ensure the shock and embarrassment of strangers. Knoxville gets a prosthetic penis stuck in a vending machine and begs for help removing it. The little boy calls random men daddy and a busty woman a tramp. Caskets are knocked over walls stained with exploded excrement and wedding cakes flown into. The problem with the film which was shot in part with hidden cameras is that Irv and Billy flee the scene before any consequences can be suffered. The movie is operating in the spirit of Sacha Baron Cohens road farces but those movies were prepared to stick around for the post-prank awkwardness because that was often where the good comedy was. Knoxville? He just wants to do Jackass stunts. And director Jeff Tremaine doesnt have any visual amazements to show us like he did in the great Jackass 3D. Bad Grandpa looks proudly cruddy. But you can feel Tremaine Knoxville and their frequent Jackass co-conspirators trying to subvert narrative comedies. Their subversion is funny only when theres tension between the old man the kid and the people who dont know theyre being fooled. The most hilarious sequence involves dressing Billy as a girl and entering him in a child beauty pageant. The wrongs pile up and theres a clear object of satire. That feels new for the Jackass experience a target that isnt a crotch. Id like to see Irv try to strike again with braver gags. Id like to see him in Vegas. Id like to see him try to write The Counselor.

Comments click to enlarge Bad Grandpa Video Rated R  92 minutes  2013 A foot-long scrotum hanging out of an old mans briefs turns out to be the enduring image from this anemic bad-taste comedy starring Johnny Knoxville in octogenarian disguise and directed by Jackass veteran Jeff Tremaine. Conceptually its a cross between Borat (embarrassing situations created in public and captured on hidden camera) and Bad Santa (with Jackson Nicoll as the old mans eight-year-old grandson and fellow troublemaker). Theres one great sight gag--seated on a childrens ride outside a discount store Knoxville is catapulted through a plate-glass window--but most of the others are painfully trite (a corpse knocked out of a casket at a funeral a mechanical bed that goes crazy). Onlookers occasionally glance into the camera a pretty good sign that people are hip to these prankster movies now and just play along. By J.R.

His wife has died meaning Zisman is free to chase ""tail."" Too bad hes saddled with his eight-year-old grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) whom he has to drive cross-country to bring him to his deadbeat dad now that Billys mom is in jail again. In this Nov. 2 2010 photo U.S reality television personality and daredevil Ryan Dunn attends the Jackass 3D UK Premiere at a central London cinema. Police say Dunn and a passenger in his 2007 Porsche died early Monday June 20 2011 of injuries sustained in a car crash in suburban Philadelphia. Jorge Herrera/AP video Video Jackass star Ryan Dunn killed video Jackass 3D rules box office Along the way the two play out such tired pranks from the Jackass repertoire as brazenly shop lifting flatulating in public and destroying property.Between stunts Irving and Billy sit in the car for long boring stretches of banter. Billy wants to go fishing and Irving likes to dance to music on the radio. Why keep up the ruse? Does anyone who buys a ticket to a Jackass movie care to see Knoxville emote over the growing love for a grandchild?There are a few funny set pieces such as when he and Billy crash a childrens pageant. But for the most part the gags are older than Zisman and more juvenile than Billy attempting to flirt with women by using crude sexual vulgarities or sitting at a picnic table more or less begging passersby to admonish Irving for letting Billy drink beer.At least when Sacha Baron Cohen took a similar road trip across the U.S. in Borat his shenanigans had a satirical edge exposing the homophobia xenophobia and ignorance of many of the people he encountered. Here the antics come off as gags for the sake of cheap laughs.In large part thats because the crew from the earlier Jackass movies - Steve-O Bam Margera Jason ""Wee Man"" Acuna and the rest of the gang - arent here to join in the revelry. And watching this gaggle of moronic manchildrens gleeful camaraderie is what made previous Jackass films so much fun. And because they were all voluntarily in on it together whether going at each other with hair clippers or zapping one another with stun guns it made it easy - and fun - to laugh at them if not always with them. But when Billy and his bad grandpa prank unsuspecting strangers its simply mean-spirited.Its been 11 years since Jackass The Movie and three since Jackass 3D although it feels a lot longer than that. Johnny Knoxville is now 42 and hes clearly torn. He still wants to be a Jackass but in a movie with an actual story that offers something even slightly more substantive than cringing at other peoples self-inflicted pain and humiliation.I suppose he deserves credit for trying but like Zismans wife it might be time to stuff the franchise into the trunk of an old car and put it to rest.

"Bad Grandpa packs a plot. But hes still a Jackass review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBad Grandpa packs a plot. But hes still a Jackass reviewJackass comedy Bad Grandpa starring Johnny Knoxville and Jackson Nicoll adds a plot to the gross-out mixBy Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Oct. 24 2013Bad GrandpaStarring Johnny Knoxville and Jackson Nicoll. Directed by Jeff Tremaine. 90 minutes. Opening Oct. 25 at major theatres. 14ATheres an unexpected guest along for Jackass-branded gross-out comedy Bad Grandpa a plot.The usual penis-mulching and projectile-pooping shenanigans captured on hidden cameras the better to share the looks of horrified disbelief from unsuspecting observers remain.Article Continued BelowBut for the fourth Jackass movie Johnny Knoxville and his band of pranking yahoos have ventured into new territory by hanging typically random comic bits and half-baked sketches on a flimsy story. Theyve also swapped the franchises trademark stunts designed to test the pain threshold of the cast for situational send-ups and various examples of grossity.Knoxville unrecognizable in heavy makeup stars as 86-year-old Irving Zisman a horny curmudgeon reluctantly tasked with taking 8-year-old grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) on a cross-country road trip to deposit him with his absentee dad.Also along for the ride -- albeit in the trunk -- are the remains of Irvings late wife Ellie.The earliest gags are the best including a laugh-out-loud bit involving a funeral home and a traumatized choir. And the outtakes over the closing credits are worth sticking around for if you have nothing better to do.The remaining hour or so is a lowbrow pastiche of gags some of which creakily date back to Candid Camera days -- among them trying to ship a kid in a wardrobe box and trashing the champagne pyramid at a wedding reception.The bulk of the rest is more the stuff of Sacha Baron Cohens Borat and Bruno revolving around Irvings failed attempts to make time with women including crashing a black all-male strip review that ends with plenty of screen time for grandpas droopy prosthetic scrotum. Young Nicoll (Fun Size The Fighter) with his cherubic chubby cheeks and deadpan delivery is a budding comic talent who may regret agreeing to appear in drag for a romp at a kiddie beauty pageant (think Little Miss Sunshine on acid).But hes a game foil for Knoxvilles grandpa working some of the movies best lines while showing a talent for delivery especially in a series of waiting-room encounters where he confides in one woman that his mommys breath is bad because ""she smokes so much crack.""The filmmakers would have us believe were watching unscripted reactions to surprise situations but on several occasions it all appears as phony as the stretchy rubber penis grandpa gets stuck in a vending machine. A scene involving menacing child-protecting bikers is the most obvious of the lot.Fans of the MTV series and related flicks will be quite entertained by this latest extrusion from the Jackass factory. But like the lime-green bingo dabber contents Irving drinks down to the horror of his seatmates its an acquired taste.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Hey works for me. It may not work for you of course and I worry about that. I can imagine people looking for three-star-and-better reviews finding capsules for this and ""Blue Jasmine"" and saying ""Hmm which one? Oh lets see Grandpa it starts in 10 minutes"" Because not all three-star movies are created equal. But what good movies share at least in my mind is a simple honesty. They know what theyre about and what they want to accomplish and how they want to do it. They set out to deliver a certain kind of entertainment and they do that. Sometimes its a delicate comedy-drama with Oscar-worthy performances and touches of ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" And sometimes its a kind of foul-mouthed ""Candid Camera"" full of poop jokes and Johnny Knoxville in old-man makeup. The latter of course is the movie under discussion here built -- very flimsily -- around an elderly but still disreputable character who sometimes showed up in various ""Jackass"" films and TV shows. He engaged in the same real-life mayhem as the rest of the characters but his age put a twist on it; hiding behind those latex wrinkles he could dare more (and incite more too) and yet maybe even get away with it. For this movie hes been given a grandson and a mission to get him crosscountry to his deadbeat dad. Its basically like some half-forgotten Walter Matthau movie from 1984 but with explosive diarrhea and a lot of rubbery old-man body parts you dont want to see. Also an iffy performance by Knoxville -- hes a little too spry for a drunken octogenarian -- and thanks to the hidden cameras some truly awful photography which is sometimes grainy or out-of-focus. The honest embarrassing truth though is that a lot of this is funny. Not maybe the bathroom jokes or grandpas arguments with his son-in-law (there are real actors sprinkled throughout the film and their scenes are often the weakest). But the real-life stuff? The hidden-camera footage of two women who seem -- however briefly -- to at least consider mailing a child parcel post? Or the crashing of a kiddie beauty pageant? Or the unnamed gentleman with the East Coast attitude who definitely gotta problem with dis joker knocking over dat penguin? Pretty terrific. Of course the whole things a bit of a stunt and I just dont mean the various car crashes Knoxville subjects himself to; the scenes with real people are all funnier because we know theyre real people. Yet because theyre real people the scenes trail off; either the folks walk away or the shot is abruptly cut. As actual scenes they build to nothing; theyre no more fully dramatically realized than a joy-buzzer handshake. But you know sometimes joy buzzers -- and pratfalls and funny costumes -- are really all you need for a laugh or two. Or even a three-star comedy. Just dont say -- if you have a low tolerance for crude rude and lewd -- that I didnt warn you. Ratings note The film contains strong language nudity sexual situations substance abuse violence and way-underage drinking. Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa (R) Paramount (92 min.)

Bad Grandpa The Jackass Boys Embrace Narrative Complexity and Human Emotion. Sorta. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 25 2013 808 AM Bad Grandpa The Jackass boys embrace narrative complexity and genuine human emotion. Well kinda. By Dan Kois Johnny Knoxville and Jackson Nicoll star in Bad Grandpa. Photo by Sean Cliver/Paramount Pictures Corporation Its the rare movie whose credit-sequence outtakes are more satisfying than the movie itself. But thats the case with Bad Grandpa the fourth film from Jackass jokesters Jeff Tremaine Johnny Knoxville and Spike Jonze. As the credits roll we get to see some of the complicated mechanics behind this reality/fiction hybrid camera operators hidden inside Dumpsters makeup artists turning Knoxville into his 86-year-old character Irving Zisman and unsuspecting dupes being informed that the bizarre scene they just witnessed was in fact part of a movie. Its totally engaging and makes me want to buy the Bad Grandpa DVD when it comes out provided it comes with an hourlong making-of doc. Dan Kois Dan Kois is Slates culture editor and co-host of Mom and Dad Are Fighting and a contributing writer to the New York Times Magazine. He is writing a book called How to Be a Family. The movie itself is not unsatisfying though its less fun than previous Jackass films and has a worse title. Bad Grandpa is certainly a fascinating experiment; this time rather than a plotless assemblage of outrageous stunts and bizarre pranks Tremaine and co. tell a story featuring ""characters"" and ""scenes"" and even a bit of ""dialogue."" The point of the movie remains the pranks and stunts but holding them all together just barely is a half-assed narrative about a grandpa delivering his grandson from his mother in Lincoln Neb. to his father in Raleigh N.C. The movies biggest shock isnt Johnny Knoxville getting his penis stuck in things. (Though he does never fear.) Its that this half-assed narrative embraces heartfelt emotion in its final act--and to some degree succeeds. But first the tomfoolery. This movie is light on the stunts that made previous Jackass movies so disgustingly watchable--no one for example plays pantsless tetherball with a beehive. Instead most of the scenes involve public pranks Irving or his grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) doing something mortifying in a funeral home or bingo parlor while innocent spectators/victims try to cope. At one point Grandpa tries to ship Billy across the country in a big cardboard box and the poor shipping-services employees must figure out what to do with this old man handing them a carton that keeps saying ""Grandpa Im hungry."" It really takes a lot to get someone mad at you in America. Advertisement What impressed me again and again is how unflappably polite Americans can be. It really takes a lot to get someone mad at you in America Over and over again Irving says and does horrible things and the kind people of Knoxville or Charlotte or Raleigh just chuckle uncomfortably at him. (In this respect the old-man costume does help; more than one prank victim clearly believes Irving must simply be senile and a lot of his targets seem less threatened by an elderly gentleman making obscene gestures in their direction than they would by say an appropriately aged Johnny Knoxville.) The result though is that a surprising number of scenes fall flat. Its funny-ish to watch a drunken Irving pushed in a shopping cart by Billy order ""poontang"" at the drive-thru window of Chapel Hill restaurant treasure Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen; its less funny to watch the manager steer him into the parking lot kindly ask if hes OK and then pass along his request to the drive-thru clerk--who wisely answers that shes not interested because ""hes 80 years old in a shopping cart."" The scenes that work best--that had me and everyone in the audience shrieking with laughter while also averting our eyes--are the ones in which Knoxville as Irving pushes things further and further until he finally encounters some resistance. Im thinking here of a particular tour de force at ladies night in a St. Louis lounge which has hired male strippers for the evening. The scene continues past the point of discomfort into pure comedic agony as everyone in the club becomes more and more enraged by Irvings behavior. Like many scenes in the movie the sequence stops only at what I assume is the exact moment when the crew must have dashed through the doors making it rain fifties and legal releases on everyone in the club. Needless to say Billy and Grandpa bond over the course of the trip and Grandpa begins questioning the wisdom of delivering Billy to his burnout father. Thats when the decency of everyday Americans pays off for the movie in a jaw-dropping sequence involving the bikers in the Gastonia N.C. chapter of Guardians of the Children. Thats all Ill say lest I spoil it for you but I do not exaggerate when I say that I teared up a little bit during this scene. Not because I was really worried about fictional-kid-in-the-real-world Billy but because when real people see real trouble--not the baloney make-believe of Johnny Knoxville pretending to poop on a wall but deep trouble of the sort that makes your heart hurt--they still sometimes step up to the plate. I didnt expect to get that message from Bad Grandpa. I dont even think the goofball filmmakers of Bad Grandpa expected to deliver it. But it was beautiful nonetheless.

The prosthetic geriatric is back this time on a road trip with his equally ill-socialized grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll). Thats about the long and the short of the plot which is merely a perfunctory frame around a messy string of hidden-camera gags--the most audacious of which finds Irving unwittingly bellying up to the bar of a male strip club where he tries to best the dancers at their own buffed and waxed game. But whereas the previous Jackass films made Knoxville and his masochistic comrades the bee-stung butts of the joke here the laughs come at the expense of unwitting subjects who are usually poor nonwhite or both. The dynamic plays out again and again Knoxville seamlessly made up as an elderly man says or does something horrible--say fighting at his wifes funeral until her the casket is knocked off its stand--and the cameras record the shocked and offended faces of unlucky suckers (at least those who could be convinced to sign a release form). Apart from a handful of physical stunts and the penultimate biker-bar setup Knoxville never puts himself at risk and the imbalance of power curdles the imperative to laugh at the rubes. There are a handful of brilliant set pieces including a scorched-earth attack on child beauty pageants. But this exercise in wink-nudge bad taste simply leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

Take the funeral scene for instance. The onlookers are people who are waiting to be paid they are the caterers etc. The power imbalance both forces them to take part in the shenanigans and makes them the brunt of the joke. This is the power imbalance the reviewer is talking about. Admittedly Im not all the way through the movie yet but so far the targets for mockery have largely been those from disadvantaged backgrounds. I dont think this is a shallow observation as there is much to say about the design choice of these set pieces what does this say about our tolerance of mockery? Are you telling me there were no upper-class whites in america that could have been marks? I highly doubt that. I question whether this choice was to minimize the legal backlash that could occur from these stunts (see the stories about Borats filming particularly the upper-class lawsuits that came down the pipe after it was released). FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 4 2014BeccaFeaturedIm still trying to understand what relevance mentioning ""poor"" people and ""non-whites"" have to do with the tone of the movie.

How idiotic Who cares what color the victims of the jokes are? That has nothing to do with anything.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 30 2013AngelaFeaturedI always thought when you write a review you would actually research the things you believe are true before proposing a final ""piece"". This was absurd. First of all the fact that Johnny ""never takes risks"" how many times do you see an elderly man jumping off bridges just to take risks? None I hope. So the level of risks were for plot based reasons so people wouldnt immediately assume hes playing a prank. To get an authentic reaction it has to be BELIEVABLE. Second I KNOW that Johnny has taken numerous risks. Think of all the damages and possibilities he could have gotten hurt or sued by someone. Also since you didnt do your research AT ALL you wouldnt understand how many times he injured himself. This I know because I READ INTERVIEWS. Maybe develop a sense of legitimacy before writing. He also took a big risk into shooting this idea just like any director does when they make a film it can either make or break them. Johnny Noxville has put an extreme amount of risk into his many productions I commend him for this.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/us/film/jackass-presents-bad-grandpa-movie-review,200,jackasspresentsbadgrandpa9,jackasspresentsbadgrandpa,timeout

Johnny Knoxville hidden under a deftly authentic senior-citizen makeup job (liver spots salty mustache thinning white hair combed back) pretends to be a cantankerous old coot named Irving who after the death of his wife (a happy event in his eyes) drives across America with his grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) going into bars and bingo parlors and supermarkets saying the most rudely inappropriate things he can. He propositions women with raunchy bluntness or has Billy do it for him. He gets his member stuck in a soda machine stops a car wash when an airbag goes off in his face and generally behaves like someone who has just escaped from the senior center and has lost his marbles (though not his testicles; they or at least an outrageous prosthetic version of them are on full display). Knoxville fires off some good lines (""I might be too old to stir the gravy but I can still lick the spoon"" he tells one female ""prospect""). But the character once you get used to him (which takes about two minutes) isnt some wildly inspired comic creation. Knoxville doesnt have enough fun with the voice and the truth is hes not really a very convincing old man. The one consistent joke of Bad Grandpa -- ""consistent"" in this case being a nice word for ""repetitive"" -- are the looks on the faces of the innocents hes punking. Their reactions are obviously genuine and they tend to be mildly pop-eyed but polite and even on occasion openly amused (as with the woman who cracks up every time Irving takes another greedy swig of liquid blue bingo-board paste). Occasionally someone gets truly steamed like the lunk in a parking lot who screams at Irving after he destroys a giant plastic chicken mascot. But mostly hes shrugged off as harmless. In the Jackass films the outraged looks tended to be on the faces of the audience. It was impossible to guess what depraved nauseating or infantile body-mauling ritual Knoxille and his boys were going to spring on you next and that gave the movies like the MTV series a creatively funny one-atrocity-after-another quality. Bad Grandpa by contrast has a same-thing-over-and-over quality even though that one thing is amusing enough. The film presents itself as a comedy of danger but thinking back on the sorts of button-pushing antics that Sacha Baron Cohen sprung in Borat and Bruno he goaded and manipulated the victims of his pranks with a lot more abusive daring. Bad Grandpa does have a handful of hilarious set pieces. A corpse falling out of a casket is always good for a big laugh and when Irving stages his own private farting contest in the back booth of a diner the explosive climax is as shocking to us as it is to the patrons (the rare moment in the movie when thats true). One of the high points has Irving going into a bar thats been turned for an evening into an impromptu female strip joint (yes he gets up and performs). And at the end when the grandson in drag enters a little-girl beauty contest the movie far outdoes the crowning moment of Little Miss Sunshine. But most of Bad Grandpa lacks that delirious mad kick of surprise. Youll occasionally laugh out loud but the heart of the movie is safe enough to chuckle at.

"Review Johnny Knoxvilles Bad Grandpa is higher-brow lowbrow - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Johnny Knoxvilles Bad Grandpa is higher-brow lowbrow Bad Grandpa movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Bad Grandpa starring Johnny Knoxville and Jackson T Nicoll. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews Bad Grandpa starring Johnny Knoxville and Jackson T Nicoll. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Words I thought Id never write ""Jackass"" Johnny Knoxville has made an actual movie.I dont mean the occasional part the actor takes in someone elses film notably Luke Duke in 2005s ""The Dukes of Hazzard."" Or the string of stunts that migrated pretty much intact to the big screen from MTVs ""Jackass"" reality series with ""Jackass The Movie"" in 2002 followed by ""Jackass Number Two"" and ""Jackass 3D."" All lowbrow low-budget and lucrative. What I do mean is that ""Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa"" is an evolution. The film has a story complete with a beginning middle and end. It has some acting and emotion. And most shocking of all -- it has empathy.Which may make hard-core ""Jackass"" fans -- the highly coveted young adult male demo that throws good money at bad entertainment all the time -- shudder. PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsRest easy boys; there is still much for our man Johnny to fear. And waiting for you is that quintessential ""Jackass"" moment when you ask the friend or stranger next to you -- between howls of laughter it should be noted -- ""Is that really his ...? Are those really his ...?""In ""Bad Grandpa"" Knoxville now 42 and certifiably middle-aged crazy stays very much in the danger zone. In the grand ""Jackass"" tradition ""Grandpas"" antics are as politically incorrect as ever -- racist sexist and salacious. Unsuspecting citizens are ""caught on tape"" as they are exposed to the insanity another ""Jackass"" trademark. And most important the movie is hysterical in the worst possible ways; ones that make you feel as if a public apology is due ""So sorry everyone.""Knoxvilles brand of anarchy has been dismissed as everything from total nonsense to a real danger for those who try to replicate the pranks (all the films carry a warning label). But hes actually playing with an extreme form of performance art framed by a frat-boy locker-room keg-party mentality. In all that running amok that so often involves (and I dont know why) alligators subversive social jabs can be found. Case in point You could argue there was a subtle message to ""think before you ink"" in the classic ""Off-Road Tattoo"" bit in one of the earlier films. PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesSadly there are no alligators in ""Bad Grandpa"" at least that I recall but everything else is there including a few thoughts on the current state of our growing geriatric nation and broken families that too often leave grandparents to raise the little ones.""Grandpas"" various bad influences have been cooked up by the original ""Jackass"" creative team which in addition to Knoxville includes Jeff Tremaine and ""Being John Malkovich"" filmmaker Spike Jonze. The trio share screenplay credit for this docu-comedy-drama hybrid and Tremaine as he has from the beginning directs.The story is grounded in Knoxvilles old-guy character Irving Zisman whos been used for odd scams here and there in the past. Now hes got an entire backstory.PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie clubAs ""Grandpa"" opens Zisman is 86 and newly widowed. To get the central gag going there is a funeral for his late wife Ellie (basically a coffin cameo by Catherine Keener aged beyond recognition and as silent as the grave) with an unsuspecting choir in attendance. Zisman is thanking them for their time making apologies for his absent daughter (Georgina Cates) and grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) when like a bad penny they turn up.The action from this point on is driven by what where and how to handle Grandma Ellies dead body and by Billys disposal as well. Hes been dumped with Grandpa while mom heads to prison and deadbeat dad (Zia Harris) lives thousands of miles away.A road trip and many indelicate encounters follow as the pair make their way to Billys dad for the big handoff. The patience of many will be tested including any female of any age many fast food and convenience store owners some kiddie beauty pageant contestants a few strip-club patrons and countless random people on the street.PHOTOS Fall movie sneaks 2013  Some forgive the old guy or the kid -- Nicoll is a chip off the Knoxville block and I mean that with all due respect. Some do not. One 45-year-old guy threatens to ""tune Grandpa up"" over a penguin debacle.There are also a surprising number of serious and sweet moments between Billy and Grandpa. Actual family bonding takes place in the open for anyone to see.Now I dont mean to suggest that ""Bad Grandpa"" has gone highbrow -- the ""Jackass"" brow is just as arched as ever. And to be clear the plot is slight. The dialogue goes from not bad to not too bad.Still its amazing what a little story and a little substance add to a movie. It might not be a giant leap for mankind but it is a small step for one old man.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com ----------------------------Jackass Presents Bad GrandpaMPAA rating R for strong crude and sexual content throughout language some graphic nudity and brief drug use.Running time 1 hour 32 minutes Playing In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Johnny Knoxville Bad Grandpa Reviews Entertainment Jackson Nicoll MTV Spike Jonze ""Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa"" Stars who turned down or were turned down for ultimately famous roles Review The Counselor a bleak waste of A-list talent Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-bad-grandpa-review-20131025,0,4373458.story#axzz2ig5NxZ3G",200,jackasspresentsbadgrandpa11,jackasspresentsbadgrandpa,latimes

Along the way they stage ""Jackass""-style pranks and stunts capturing the reactions of unsuspecting civilians as earlier installments in the endless franchise did.The weird-sounding mix of scripted narrative and found footage works better than it seems it might. The bits feature fewer life-threatening stunts than when this franchise and Mr. Knoxville were young and more sight gags many with a high gross-out factor.Its hard to score big laughs with hidden-camera material these days because there has been so much of it since the ""Jackass"" TV show but Mr. Knoxville and his young sidekick still land a few jaw-droppers. Certainly the contestants at a kiddie beauty pageant they visit near the films end will need therapy for years.""Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for crudeness of all sorts.

Photo MTV Films MOVIE REVIEW Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa Running time 92 minutes. Rated R (crude and sexual humor profanity nudity drug use). At the E-Walk the Kips Bay the Magic Johnson others So the five professional writers of ""Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa"" sat down to think up ways for Johnny Knoxville in the guise of an 86-year-old man with an 8-year-old boy by his side to outrage America. They came up with Invading the floor of a strip club and letting a rubber dingle-dangle fall out of his shorts. Stuffing a loaf of bread down his pants at a grocery store. Volcanically emptying his colon on the wall of a diner. Fellas You could have saved a lot of money by asking some fifth-graders to name the funniest things they could imagine. This whole movie is pretty much a mental colon blow. Knoxville as "" Irving Zisman"" tries to hold together this series of candid-camera sketches about a grandfather on a road trip through the middle of the country to return his grandson (Jackson Nicoll) to the boys daddy. The movie is interesting only by accident such as when Irving wanders into a bar packed with a sexagenarian biker gang of toughs wearing ""G.O.C."" gear. ""G.O.C.""? ""Guardians of the Children"" a hulking man-bear replies. ""Were a biker organization and we help abused kids man."" The G.O.C. sounds a lot more compelling than Johnny Knoxville in the dairy aisle drinking a bottle of chocolate milk he hasnt paid for. Theres a problem with the spectacle of a Hollywood zillionaire coming down from the mountain trying to get a rise out of working-class America. The Jackass boys picked an amazingly good-humored and tolerant country. About the worst they can get out of people is restrained gasps. Nobody orders Knoxville whipped with a flame-broiled piece of barbed wire. Only once or twice does he even get yelled at. Johnny needs to raise the stakes a little. How about some Jackassery in a place notable for its lack of a sense of humor like Saudia Arabia? Sudden-onset diarrhea on a Koran in a public square in downtown Riyadh Now that would be inappropriate. It might even be edgy.

Scott Bowles USA TODAY 1038 a.m. EDT October 25 2013Jackson Nicoll 8 is the Jackass films secret weapon.Bad Grandpa with Jackson Nicoll and Johnny Knoxville is an extended Jackass gag.(Photo Sean Cliver)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourStars Johnny Knoxville Jackson Nicoll Spike JonzeRated R; Runtime 1 hour 32 minutes; Opens nationwide FridayMove over Borat. Theres a new class clown valedictorian.Rude wrong and laugh-till-you-snort funny Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa ( out of four rated R opens nationwide Friday) not only stands as the best installment (by bounds) of Johnny Knoxvilles hidden-camera franchise; its one of the sharpest comedies of the year.Part feature part stand-up road act Grandpa tamps down the raunch of the MTV series to find something unexpected a little story a lot of heart and a treasure of an 8-year-old actor.Like Borat creator Sacha Baron Cohen Knoxville has become too recognizable for his candid cameras to capture the public unawares now. So he undergoes a prosthetic makeover to become 86-year-old Irving Zisman a crotchety geezer obsessed with crotches -- his own and the unsuspecting public foils he cant help but harangue.STORY The wedgies pop-culture pull proves irresistibleVIDEO Johnny Knoxville would date this Golden GirlREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersBy itself the joke would barely support a 22-minute Jackass TV episode. But longtime Jackass director Jeff Tremaine working with a script co-written by auteur filmmaker Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich Adaptation) takes a daring approach to the public gags overlaying them with the template of a plot.As we learn through Grandpas account to horrified passersby the old man is ready to party like its 1899 after the death of his henpecking wife Ellie (Catherine Keener). Problem is Irvings daughter is headed to jail for drugs forcing him to take a cross-country trip to drop 8-year-old Billy (Jackson Nicoll) off with his neer-do-well toker son-in-law Chuck (Zia Harris). That still could be fodder for a collection of random sketches the format of the previous three Jackass films. Yet Knoxville and Nicoll stay so in character throughout Grandpa that by films end our heroes have mustered some dramatic tension.Of course laughs still rule Knoxvilles world and he finds doozies here beginning with his wifes memorial service before a handful of funeral home employees and onlookers suckered into the program.As youd expect Grandpa cant help but stir trouble leading to the caskets collapse. What you might not expect is Knoxvilles crass charm in convincing attendees to join in a rousing chorus of Ive Got the Joy Joy Joy Joy -- while the corpse rests on the floor. If Candid Camera creator Allen Funt was TVs practical joke king Knoxville has become cinemas. He sees humor not in the punchline but the reaction to it.And what reactions he gets. While 2006s Borat skewered U.S. racism and xenophobia Grandpa takes a broader look at Americans for better or worse. Knoxville finds the usual cadre of huckleberries employees at a mail center debating whether its legal to ship a child cross-country; a 45-year-old muscle-bound dimwit who threatens to ""tune up"" a man he thinks is twice his age; beauty show contestant parents who could be extras from Little Miss Sunshine.Yet its Grandpas heartwarming scenes that make it shine Strangers who berate Grandpa for giving the kid a six-pack for breakfast dropping f-bombs in front of the boy and leaving a child downtown while he hits the strip clubs. As Billy Nicoll is terrific remaining doe-eyed (even while Knoxville cracks up) as he queries grown-ups about strippers or why his moms breath smells like crack cocaine. Nicoll who made his debut as Christian Bales son in The Fighter is comedic gold.Still the movies best moment is sincere not snarky. Near the finale as the actors converge on a seedy bar for the custody handoff we meet Guardians of the Children a real biker gang dedicated to assisting abused youths. Knoxville clearly meant to rile the gang but he could not have expected the group to not only feed the kid but threaten the boys miscreant father that if he harmed the boy hed be facing ""the angel of death.""Not all the comedy works. Grandpas lecherous advances to women are funny when they put Knoxville in his place but not when they bristle uncomfortably. Knoxville remains in love with body parts and scatological humor.But the movie is having so much fun the trespasses are forgivable and the final credits -- featuring a grinning Knoxville pointing out the hidden cameras to his dupes -- capture a kid with one hand in the cookie jar and the other with a hand buzzer. Smile. Youre on grandpas prank list. 353 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1bjF76LFall Movies Calendar OctoberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this October.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint If you live in a binary world where experiences are either stupid or brilliant with a firm dividing line in between you have my condolences. Youll never appreciate the sublime idiocy of ""Bad Grandpa"" my contender for funniest movie of the year. I didnt say best comedy because a better film might try to touch the heart or mind in ways that ""Bad Grandpa"" never attempts. But in terms of explosive laugh-the-shingles-off the-theater-roof hilarity I havent seen a movie this good in ages. The setup is a clever hybrid of scripted story and the ""Jackass"" teams improv-heavy hidden-camera stunt comedy. Encrusted in old age makeup. Johnny Knoxville plays 86-year-old Irving Zisman. Recently widowed and randy as a rooster the old coot finds himself saddled with having to deliver grandson Billy (deadpan delightfully guileless Jackson Nicoll) to his father a thousand miles away. Their road trip is the excuse for a cavalcade of elaborately choreographed pranks on unsuspecting bystanders with Irving as the instigator and Billy as his sidekick. Upbeat grinning and lewd Grandpa puts the moves on the ladies at a bingo hall gets his dangly bits entangled with a soda machine and makes the boy his accomplice on a takedown of a little-miss beauty pageant. The film explores realms of anatomically explicit politically incorrect exuberantly dirty-minded comedy that are indefensible by any known standard of decency. And also hilarious. The movie is scurrilous and scuzzy but theres dedicated craftsmanship behind it. The physical humor is explosive yet precise. Theres a version of the old motorized-bed-run-amok gag here. It takes that premise further than anything Ive ever witnessed. Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong crude and sexual content throughout language some graphic nudity and brief drug use. Knoxvilles naughty-pensioner riffs are endlessly inventive and the tone is carefully controlled. The gags are never at the onlookers expense. Its all about capturing their gobsmacked reactions to Knoxville and Nicolls shenanigans. ""Bad Grandpa"" has the thrill of a dirty joke brilliantly told. This film is emphatically not for everyone but if its not for you too bad. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

But somewhere in that crude transgressive movie lay the makings of a crude R-rated gross-out comedy. Director Jeff Tremaine comedian Johnny Knoxville and other members of the team behind the MTV show ""Jackass"" and its three movie incarnations have taken Korines basic concept minus the nihilism and added pratfalls scatological stunts a touch of sentimentality and the unwitting participation of innocent bystanders shot with hidden cameras. Though at times it grows predictable and more inane than outrageous ""Bad Grandpa"" gets more than its share of cheap laughs. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

Photo Sean Cliver Paramount Pictures Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa review 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa Comedy. Starring Johnny Knoxville and Jackson Nicoll. Directed by Jeff Tremaine. (R. 92 minutes.) The Jackass franchise is growing old gracefully - as much as any movie that begins with an elderly man getting his penis caught in a soda machine can be considered a maturation. ""Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa"" takes the old man-prosthetic-makeup pranking antics from the previous three movies to feature-length extremes with Johnny Knoxville unleashing his 86-year-old Irving Zisman character on unsuspecting crowds. The uneven result is definitely not for prudish moviegoers definitely funny for everyone else and even approaches poignancy in one or two scenes. The biggest shock This time theres actually a plot. Granted its a plot that includes a prosthetic hanging scrotum and explosive diarrhea gags. Still ""Jackass"" is so much closer to ""On Golden Pond"" than anyone could have imagined when the MTV show debuted 13 years ago ... Knoxville returns mostly as a solo act with longtime director Jeff Tremaine and co-conspirator Spike Jonze working behind the scenes. The production feels diluted in the beginning like a 1970s rock band thats touring with only one of the original members. Adding to the shaky foundation is a new format which mixes ""Borat""-style hidden camera infiltrations with scripted interludes - following an 86-year-old horny old coot (Knoxville buried in convincing prosthetics) on a road trip to deliver his equally profane grandson to a no-good father. Making up for the loss of the rest of the Jackass crew is 9-year-old sidekick Jackson Nicoll who stays clear of the higher profile stunts - Knoxville gets catapulted through a plate glass window - while holding his own interacting with the public. Nicolls comic timing is impressive especially during a series where he asks strange men if theyll be his dad. The powerhouse finish involves Nicolls participation in drag in a little miss beauty pageant in North Carolina. The ""Jackass"" filmmakers once again push of comfort boundaries for moviegoers this time with a child involved. The language coming out of the 9-year-olds mouth on its own would earn the film an R rating. But ""Bad Grandpa"" feels less depraved than the previous entries. For one thing they appear to use fake excrement in their pranks instead of the real thing. (Baby steps ...) Later as Knoxville and Nicoll continue to do the wrong thing the people they encounter in rural pockets of the Midwest and South obey their moral compasses at almost every turn. The third act includes a drop-off with a group of bikers who act as guardian angels for abused children. Their tenderness toward the neglected child they think has entered their bar is actually kind of moving. Some of the pranks are masterfully executed; the beauty pageant and a disastrous funeral near the beginning stand out. But on the whole ""Bad Grandpa"" cant locate a consistent groove. Even as Knoxville stays in character the filmmakers never find the right pacing between the prank-driven scenes and often awkward narrative elements. Meanwhile curiosity builds for moviegoers who are left wondering how did the ""victims"" react after each prank was revealed. Knoxville Tremaine and Jones give us that pleasure in one big dump during the final credits which show that Nicolls parents were indeed on the set and the bikers in particular took the joke really well. Your faith in humanity will be restored even as they clean the fake poo off the wall. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Johnny Knoxville left plays an irresponsible oldster who takes a road trip with his young grandson played by Jackson Nicoll in ""Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa."" (Sean Cliver/ Associated Press) By Michael OSullivan October 24 2013 If you liked the ""Jackass"" television series and its movie spinoffs youll probably love ""Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa."" Starring Johnny Knoxville the chief perpetrator of many of the disgusting and/or painful-looking stunts featured in those reality shows and films ""Bad Grandpa"" is a loose sequence of hidden-camera pranks centered on the outrageous antics of a fictional octogenarian. Some of them are quite funny but only to the degree that you are able be amused by explosive diarrhea and the effects of age and gravity on certain parts of the male anatomy. Yes I laughed. That is to say the 13-year-old-boy who lives inside me -- and who sometimes comes out despite my best efforts to shackle him in the attic of my psyche where he is denied food and water -- laughed. Consider this I also gave ""Movie 43"" 31 / 2 stars. ""Bad Grandpa"" has only the most superficial of plots. Irving a lecherous foul-mouthed and wildly irresponsible old coot created by Knoxville during the last season of his television show is driving his 8-year-old grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) across the country. Knoxvilles old-age makeup looks strikingly real and most of the people he encounters take him for exactly what he appears to be an elderly idiot who has no business taking care of himself let alone a minor. In structure and concept the film resembles the faux-documentary ""Borat"" with the distinction that the cameras here are all hidden. And that is where the film falls down and cant get up. Unlike in Sacha Baron Cohens 2006 punking of middle America the reactions of the people who are fooled by Knoxvilles ""Candid Camera""-style stunts just arent all that funny. Yes there are some hilarious setups. Irving hires unsuspecting movers to help him load his late wifes corpse (played by co-producer Spike Jonze in drag) into the trunk of his car; Billy also in drag enters a child beauty pageant performing a raunchy striptease to Warrants ""Cherry Pie"" before an audience of shocked parents; Irving soils himself flamboyantly in a diner. But most of the folks caught on camera seem stuck somewhere between bemusement and mild alarm. Only a grocery store owner who catches Irving and Billy shoplifting musters anything close to real outrage. Part of the subversive thrill of ""Jackass"" always lay in the fact that there was real danger whether Knoxville was tumbling around inside a filthy porta-potty or one of his cohorts was stapling his privates to his thigh. In ""Bad Grandpa"" on the other hand the stakes seem weirdly low. Even the moving men who help Irving with the disposal of his wifes ""corpse"" seem strangely unconcerned by the acts illegality despite their clients repeated (and vocal) reminders. When Irving sprays feces on the wall of a restaurant the expressions on the onlookers faces suggest that theyve just witnessed someone sneaking an unauthorized soda refill. Another problem with the film is its episodic structure. Although were allowed the perverse pleasure of watching Irving commit one inappropriate act after another our sense of horror/delight dissipates after each one. That is largely the result of interstitial scenes that while scripted feel like filler. On a side note Billys fake beauty pageant performance while naughty pales in comparison with the gyrations of one of his competitors who grinds like a prepubescent Miley Cyrus. That just goes to show that despite ""Grandpas"" best efforts to shock us truth really is stranger than fiction.   R. At area theaters.

Hes got the charisma of a natural-born star the intelligence to find a niche worth developing and the nerve to do anything necessary to exploit it. But with ""Bad Grandpa"" he just doesnt go far enough . Granted the concept is appropriately distasteful. Knoxville plays 86-year-old Irving Zisman a randy widower who inherits his dirty-mouthed 8-year-old grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll) from his crack-addicted daughter. Irvings wife (a very game Catherine Keener) has just died so he stuffs her in his car trunk and sets off across the country with Billy. With the help of lots of hidden cameras the two actors do their best to appall real-life bystanders. This being a ""Jackass"" production a pair of confused furniture movers are asked to dispose of Irvings dead wife. Male strippers find their patience tested when Irving crashes a club and tries to join in. Passersby see Billy getting drunk or begging for a new dad or helping Irving remove his private parts from a soda machine. (Some movies budget for great effects. This one went all out on prosthetics.) Some concepts in the film -- written in part by Knoxville and Spike Jonze -- are pretty funny and Knoxville and the perfectly cast Nicoll have great chemistry throughout. But longtime ""Jackass"" director Jeff Tremaine consistently cuts away too quickly undermining each joke in order to rush on to the next. The best of the written scenes finds Billy entering an actual beauty pageant dressed as a little girl. When he starts acting like a pint-sized stripper the satire finally hits a ""Borat""-level peak. But where Sacha Baron Cohen always has the daring to stand his ground Tremaine and Knoxville fold. And they do so before we learn how the judges -- who are after all used to seeing children presented as miniature adults -- might have responded. Its no surprise then that the movies real highlights come after the credits when Knoxville admits his trickery to a range of stunned victims. These candid confessions have an energy and confessionary liveliness thats lacking in the rest of the film. Any ""Jackass"" fan will tell you that the best part of any really memorable stunt isnt the setup. Its the crash that comes after. On a mobile device? Click here to watch the movie trailer.

Behold Bad Grandpa in which a widower and an 8-year-old drive across the country hitting on chicks farting in diners and getting Granddads manhood stuck in a vending machine before sending the boy out in drag to perform a striptease at a kiddie beauty pageant. The stars Johnny Knoxville and Jackson Nicoll are comedians; the extras are unsuspecting victims just going about their day in a park when the Jackass creator tootles up in convincing liver spots to land then fellate a 4-foot fish. Like Borat the joke is on the American need-to-please. How long will these real-life bingo players funeral singers and male strippers tolerate Knoxvilles antics? Very long. No one even calls the cops when he and the kid perch on a picnic bench and chug a six-pack of beer. But the joke is really on Knoxville who despite flinging himself through a glass wall and rigging up a fake poo-sprayer in his pants gets fewer laughs than his boy sidekick. An unknown child actor Nicoll has soulful eyes and an almost frightening deadpan composure. When he begs strangers to be his new dad theyre legitimately unnerved (but they still abandon him on the street). By Jackass standards Bad Grandpa is benign--its neither as fun nor as thrilling as watching Knoxville play tetherball with a beehive. But Nicoll deserves as much applause as Sunshines Abigail Breslin. Put him in a remake of The Bicycle Thief and the kid could win an Oscar.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Nearly a dozen years since the MTV show went off the air Jackass has continued its stubborn improbable run through three films and the death of a cast member (Ryan Dunn). Although the 3-D craze extended the franchise for another installment the well seemed to dry. There are only so many stunts/pranks/shenanigans the Jackass crew could pull especially as they all near middle age. Ringleader Johnny Knoxville is 42 and the stunts he could shake off in his 20s probably hurt a lot more in his 40s. Enter Irving Zisman a character Knoxville debuted in the final season of Jackass. Donning latex old-man makeup Knoxville hit the streets for hidden-camera bits with unsuspecting people who reacted to Zismans off-color jokes sexual innuendos and grotesquely stretched scrotum with horror amusement and the occasional threat. The bits became a staple of the Jackass movies so it was perhaps inevitable that he get his own movie now that the franchise has seemingly run its course. Presumably titled to take advantage of alphabetical proximity to hits like Bad Santa and Bad Teacher Bad Grandpa also borrows heavily from Borat by sending Zisman on a cross-country trip. Charged with taking his 8-year-old grandson Billy (a perfectly cast Jackson Nicoll) from Nebraska to live with the boys deadbeat father in North Carolina Zisman makes frequent stops to do things like hit on women (at a male strip club at one point) play bingo shoplift and generally get in trouble. Billy is his eager accomplice and wingman and Nicoll brings a surprising amount of sweet vulnerability to scenes that are little more than interstitials between pranks. That narrative thread connects everything so Bad Grandpa has a much more linear flow than other Jackass films but the real attraction is watching an actor in old-man makeup whip out his balls in public. Thats an exceedingly low bar to clear for success and Bad Grandpa mostly succeeds in its very modest goal. Its Borat without the satirical edge with Knoxville and longtime Jackass director Jeff Tremaine taking the most outrageous parts of that film and escalating them dramatically. Where Sasha Baron Cohens high jinks often made an uncomfortable point Bad Grandpa simply aims for outrageousness. That produces some laughs (Zismans visit to the strip club ends in a melee) but more often it feels like Tremaine and Knoxville winking to the audience to say ""Can you believe we did this?"" (In an early set piece Zisman gets his inhumanly elastic penis caught in a vending machine.) No one will ever mistake the Jackass franchise for good cinema but it never aspired to that. It was always about allowing the gleeful anarchy of the TV series to escape the constraints of television--to be more outrageous gross and profane than the FCC would ever allow. The theater setting serves these movies well because a large rowdy audience feeds off the films energy. Again its a low bar to clear but all of the Jackass films have succeeded in that regard. Bad Grandpa ostensibly evolves the series by adding a storyline which has the potential to breathe life into a franchise that had otherwise run its course--at least for an inevitable sequel. Beyond that Jackass will need another reboot but it shouldnt surprise anyone if it finds a way to persist.

Daily Edition Login to download Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa Film Review 508 PM PDT 10/23/2013 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Plenty of laughs from the first ""Jackass"" pic with an actual plot. TWITTER Johnny Knoxville puts on the geriatric makeup once more for a feature-length adventure with Irving Zisman. Jackass meets Borat in Bad Grandpa a road trip of staged real-world embarrassments that gives Johnny Knoxvilles 80-something Irving Zisman character custody of an eight-year-old grandson and watches as he introduces the boy to a range of vices. Hatching a story however slim to contain this batch of gross-out gags and ""can he get away with this?"" hidden-camera outrages is a novelty for the band of happy miscreants whove gotten so much mileage out of the Jackass franchise. It also focuses the general air of collegial numbskullery into a buddy-pic bond between Knoxville and the very well-cast Jackson Nicoll. Though the story goes slack eventually the change-up should be well received by some fans; the lack of nonstop action however limits this features chances of rivaling the surprising success of the three full-team outings that precede it. We meet Irving and grandson Billy in two separate waiting rooms In a lawyers office unsuspecting clients go wide-eyed at Billys revelation that his ""moms breath is so bad because she smokes so much crack""; across town Irving is told that his wife has passed away and responds by crowing that he might finally get laid again now that shes gone. VIDEO Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa Trailer Unfortunately for Irvings libido his daughter shows up at his wifes funeral informing him that hell have to care for Billy because shes going to jail. Eager to get the ""cock blocker"" off his hands the old man decides to take him cross-country to live with his deadbeat dad. The two set off in Irvings decaying Lincoln with Grandmas corpse swaddled in the trunk (dont ask); in-car scenes of the two actors supply some conventional getting-to-know-you tissue to connect set pieces pitting them against the public. More often than not the scenes feature Irvings genially offensive attempts to pick up ladies -- regardless of their age race or appearance. The most extreme encounter takes him to a nightclub full of black women whove come to see male strippers; people are surprisingly tolerant of Irv until he starts joining the buff dancers exposing the more pendulous parts of his (prosthetic) anatomy. STORY Johnny Knoxville on Bad Grandpa We Were Probably Crazy to Do It Some of these gags are hilarious; others offer little more than the first few beats of confusion and indignation a normal person might experience upon seeing for instance an eight-year-old puking up beer at a picnic table. Reaction shots are strung together to suggest that the old mans public negligence as a caretaker (and outright criminality as in a long shoplifting scene) goes unreported to police. But of course the filmmakers were on hand to keep concerned citizens from dialing 911. ""Gotcha"" moments that play during credits show participants relief after being let in on the joke but an edgier film might have shown what happened in between setup and relief How often did people physically try to rescue this boy who sometimes openly begs for their assistance? When not asking strangers to be his new father Nicoll offers an entertainingly deadpan acceptance of his sleazy family heritage. Knoxville keeps from running him over letting his sidekick direct some encounters even as he seems to be ignoring or belittling him. The improvised antics dont develop the pairs chemistry with the finesse of a good buddy movie though; as a result the tales lets-stay-together resolution feels pretty flimsy and contrived. Fortunately one presumes that narrative cohesion is not the highest criterion by which fans will judge it.

If the ""Jackass"" movies have always spit exuberantly in the face of age and mortality its fitting that co-creators Johnny Knoxville Spike Jonze and Jeff Tremaine have now given us one devoted to Knoxvilles octogenarian alter ego Irving Zisman. Strangely touching too given that the ""Jackass"" boys are all in their 40s now and still throwing caution to the wind. Strapping a loose narrative framework onto the series patented stunts and candid-camera gags ""Jackass Presents Bad Grandpa"" shows theres still comic life in this decade-old franchise -- provided of course the sight of a senior citizen getting his penis caught in a vending machine is the kind of thing that brings a smile to your face. Minus its full band of merry pranksters this fourth ""Jackass"" outing wont equal its predecessors hearty box office hauls but should easily recoup its negligible production costs en route to a long life in ancillary.This story first appeared in the October 29 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Originally introduced during the final season of ""Jackass"" on MTV the Zisman character has been a mainstay ever since sometimes paired with Jonzes nonagenarian prostitute character Gloria for maximum elder-care chaos. In ""Bad Grandpa"" Irvings family is fleshed out to include a crack-addict daughter (Georgina Kates) who on the verge of returning to prison tasks Irving with transporting his 8-year-old grandson (Jackson Nicoll) to the boys deadbeat father (Greg Harris) in North Carolina. Thats the ""plot"" as far as it goes which is really just a device for putting Knoxville and the cherubic foul-mouthed Nicoll (who played the son of the Christian Bale character in ""The Fighter"") in a car together and letting them wreak their inspired havoc across state lines. A couple of the movies best and most outrageous payoffs come right upfront however when Irving enlists a couple of unwitting furniture movers to help him load the corpse of the late Mrs. Zisman (Catherine Keener) into his car then tries to circumvent the road trip by simply UPS-ing little Billy all the way to Raleigh. The m.o. of ""Jackass"" has always been the comedy of physical pain -- a ""Three Stooges"" for the X-Games era -- married to a kind of anarchic street theater. Knoxville and company delight at finding ways to make life veer off its neatly ordered path and in capturing the flummoxed reactions of those who bear witness. (Sometimes Knoxvilles own reactions are even more aghast as when he finds himself still in one piece after some particularly hair-raising stunt gone awry.) Here they take an added glee in playing off social mores concerning children and the elderly -- how they should be treated and when they shouldnt be held responsible for their actions (as when Irving and Billy eat their way through a mini-mart then make a run for it). Even with Knoxville buried under layers of latex his willingness to do anything for a laugh is a gift that keeps on giving whether hes getting smashed between the jaws of a spring-loaded adjustable bed or hurled through a plate-glass window by a malfunctioning strip-mall kiddie ride. But the most talked-about sequence from ""Bad Grandpa"" seems likely to be Irvings impromptu bootie shaking (complete with low-hanging elastic scrotum) on the floor of an all-black male strip club. ""Bad Grandpa"" isnt as sustained a piece of work as the earlier ""Jackass"" pics and it can even seem tame in light of the more outrageous bits in ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"" -- perhaps a sign that Knoxville et al. are ever so slightly maturing over time. Too much of the 90-minute running time gets bogged down in Irving making lewd passes at uninterested younger women (and one possibly interested drive-thru attendant) but even at its low ebb the movie effuses an infectious mischief-making joy. After spending most of the movie as the relative straight man Nicoll proves himself every bit as fearless as his battle-scarred mentor during a drag-kiddie-pageant finale thats like tobacco juice in the eye of ""Little Miss Sunshine."" End credits feature an array of outtakes and hidden-camera reveals well worth sticking around for. Film Review Jackass Presents Bad GrandpaReviewed at Regal E-Walk New York Oct. 22 2013.

Watching a jockstrap-clad Johnny Knoxville dangle over an alligator pit with chicken parts between his legs or Steve-O intentionally give himself paper cuts or the late Ryan Dunn inserting a toy car into his own nether regions gave the shows fans a distinct kind of pleasure causing them to erupt in sounds that were somewhere between laughing and shrieking in horror. Theres not so much of that shock of the new in the latest ""Jackass"" entry ""Bad Grandpa"" but even if the film feels like the shows old stunts thrown into a blender with ""Borat"" ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and some sketches from MTVs post-""Jackass"" shock-comedy ""Wonder Showzen"" the laughs are still there even if the shrieks have died down. Also read Ryan Dunn Remembered Tributes and Criticism for the Late Jackass Star Knoxville whos earned the right to mellow out a little after breaking most if not all of his bones for his art stars (in heavy effects makeup) as senior citizen Irving Zisman whos ready to party after the death of his wife Ellie (Catherine Keener). Since Irvings daughter is going to jail on a drug charge however Irving gets stuck driving cross-country to deliver his young grandson Billy (Jackson Nicoll ""Fun Size"") to the kids neer-do-well dad. At first it seems like the movie is giving us these characters just as a framework for Knoxville and Nicoll to do outrageous things in front of unknowing passersby. That happens -- Irving shakes his saggy body for the horrified female patrons at a male-stripper bar Billy asks random people to be his new dad -- but the bare-bones structure isnt just here as a foundation for the jokes. See video Johnny Knoxville Has Sex With a Soda Machine in Bad Grandpa Redband Trailer ""Bad Grandpa"" actually expects us to be interested in the plot to the extent that Knoxville and Nicoll interact as Irving and Billy even theyre the only ones on camera. (Theyre like the hero of ""Holy Motors"" who stays in character even when hes not sure if hes being filmed.) The earlier ""Jackass"" movies worked just fine as assemblages of sketches; this time out were supposed to invest in this meager story and its a bit distracting. Still when the three-act structure gets shoved to the side for fun and games ""Bad Grandpa"" delivers some of the heartiest laughs Ive had all year. People who always found ""Jackass"" to be distasteful and cruel wont change their minds but fans will find themselves gasping over what Knoxville and the very game Nicoll can do with an air bag a bingo parlor a funeral a wedding a grocery store and a child beauty pageant. See video Johnny Knoxville and His Grandson Take on Toddlers amp; Tiaras in Bad Grandpa Trailer If the ""Jackass"" movies are to continue with Knoxville and his cohorts playing characters and pulling hidden-camera stunts on the unsuspecting then great. But if five credited writers cant figure out a way for them to blow up their cake and eat it too then maybe 90 minutes of unrelated sketches isnt such a bad thing. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The plot which sees Zisman tasked with transporting his young grandson cross-country to hand him over to his deadbeat father is little more than an excuse to string together a series of one-note sex-themed set pieces punctuated with the Borat-lite reactions of understandably bemused (and secretly filmed) bystanders. The appeal of the Jackass TV series - and its three spin-off films - was the narrative-free anarchy of grown men doing unspeakable things to themselves. In Bad Grandpa theres no shock value the physical comedy is down to a minimum replaced by a creaking humour almost as dated as Zisman himself. There are a couple of bawdy sight gags that hit the mark although the outtakes in the end credits provide the films funniest moments. The cast and crew appear to have had a ball making it at least.
