"Stranger in My House Idris Elba Is a Malignant Narcissist in No Good Deed << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Stranger in My House Idris Elba Is a Malignant Narcissist in No Good Deed Movies September 17 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print The no. 1 movie in America stars Idris Elba as Colin Evans an escaped prisoner who spends his ill-gotten freedom showing up at strangers front doors. Ordinarily the sight of this man through your peephole would be like hitting the sexy-house-call lottery. By the time Colin pays his first visit in No Good Deed however weve already heard a member of the Georgia parole board label him a malignant narcissist. Translation He loses control when he doesnt get what he wants. Colin was locked up for involuntary manslaughter but hes guilty of far worse crimes mostly against women. By the time he arrives at the vast suburban home of Terri Granger (Taraji P. Henson) Colins already racked up a body count. Why he doesnt just snap her neck is a matter of lousy screenwriting (courtesy of Aimee Lagos; the director is Sam Miller). He arrives in the middle of a storm and tells Terri his trucks been ""crashed."" Terri invites him inside while he waits for a tow even though he was standing 10 feet from the bell with his back to her looking shady when she opened the door. After she serves him tea and gives him dry clothes she reveals that she used to be a prosecutor of domestic abusers. When she says she doesnt like being a housewife the attorney shes married to (Henry Simmons) reminds her that staying at home was her choice. He does so as hes headed out for his fathers birthday -- by himself. Credulity strains not for the first time. Wouldnt grandpa like to celebrate with his daughter-in-law and his two little grandbabies? And what kind of husband leaves his family in the middle of such a storm for just a birthday party? And whats with the car alarm that goes off whenever it wants? In a movie like this youre left thinking Seriously? Some of these are actually questions Terris best friend Meg (Leslie Bibb) asks. She stops by and starts drinking (in glasses from the Olivia Pope stemware collection) and flirting with Colin. But it takes too long for her to distinguish red flags from red wine. The movie lasts 84 minutes so it wastes only a little time endangering Terri (and Meg and Terris kids). This is one of those Blank From Hell thrillers the most iconic of which is The Hand That Rocks the Cradle with Rebecca De Mornay as the nanny from hell. Its a perfect formula. The blanks insane relentlessness plus the victims naive stupidity plus the victims sassily clued-in and therefore doomed friend plus the resonance of the setting (babysitting adultery having a roommate having a temp having a fan) plus The Moment The Victim Figures It All Out equals a sick good time. Excellence is relative here. A Blank From Hell movie can stink for 84 minutes as long as the victim sends the blank through a window. No Good Deed manages to check most of those boxes (Meg you shouldve ducked) while also being dumb by the very low loose standards of the genre. We know Elba is playing a nutcase. But its possible Henson is playing two or three different women too. How does a former Atlanta prosecutor get herself in a mess like this? And when she does Figure It All Out her soft caution turns jagged and obscene. Henson is too smart a star not to know that to finish Colin off shell need more than keys and fire extinguishers and that rack thing that holds the wood in a fireplace. But here I am blaming the victim.  Last week Screen Gemss No Good Deed canceled its media screenings at the last minute. Officially the studio didnt want the plot surprise spoiled as if the press couldnt handle a plot twist. This one makes you gasp but it loses its flavor almost instantly. Again Seriously? Its also possible the studio canceled those screenings because the movies timing is bad. Is this the week for a movie about a dangerous black man and his female victims? This movie is innocent of whatevers happening in the NFL regarding violence against women and children. Its not well made enough to let you think about something other than its bad black men (Terris husband kind of sucks too). The producer is Will Packer who in the last five years has become a force in mainstream entertainment starring black actors. Obsessed the Think Like a Man movies Ride Along and About Last Night are all hits and theyre all his. Hes not filling the void the way Tyler Perry did making movies for starving black audiences. Packer is testing the boundaries of what a black movie in 2014 even is. Can we handle Idris Elba embodying murderous evil? Can we handle him beating a woman with a lamp? Its also useful to wonder whether No Good Deed can be just pop garbage with evil Elba or should Packer (and Elba) know better? Are the images of Colin with a shovel or a fist too close to that video of Ray Rice in the elevator? Maybe not for the audiences who made this movie no. 1 by a wide margin. The movie tries to be as much from Terris point of view as Colins. But her side of the movie is weak until the closing minutes when she rediscovers the woman she feels she lost. There should be something more exhilarating about the violent and hopeful epilogue finale than there is. People disturbed by Janay Rice standing by Ray might feel some catharsis in Terris fighting back but its uneasy relief. Some of the letdown really is a matter of bad pseudo-psychological moviemaking. Some of it is a matter of fatigue. Its great to see Elba playing a monster without apology. But right now it would also be nice to see a black man and black woman be more than an aggressor and his victim.

"Review No Good Deed Idris Elba Taraji P. Henson and B-movie mayhem - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review No Good Deed Idris Elba Taraji P. Henson and B-movie mayhem No Good Deed trailer ""No Good Deed"" trailer ""No Good Deed"" trailer Gary Goldstein No Good Deed Idris Elba Taraji P. Henson take B-movie material and run (scared) with it Its a little dumb (OK maybe more than a little) but ""No Good Deed"" is an otherwise brisk efficient thriller that wont punish audiences who drop in.Anchored by a pair of compelling performances by Idris Elba and Taraji P. Henson who squeeze the most out of their archetypal roles ""Deed"" makes no bones about its standard issue woman-in-jeopardy engine. That the movie is as watchable as it is even with its share of telegraphed bits and predictable moves says much about the certain grasp director Sam Miller (BBCs ""Luther"" which also starred Elba) and writer Aimee Lagos have on the unabashedly B-movie material. Elba plays Colin a violent murderer denied parole who escapes from his post-hearing transport steals a car kills again and then crashes said vehicle in a woodsy upscale Atlanta neighborhood. Handsome charming and manipulative (hes dubbed a malignant narcissist -- and for good reason) Colin works his way into the home of Terry (Henson) a former D.A. turned beleaguered mom whose caddish husband (Henry Simmons) has conveniently just left town. She also has a flirty BFF (Leslie Bibb) who has ""movie victim"" written all over her pretty face.Terry initially seems far too trusting for the tough gal shell soon become. To wit she goes from chatting up Colin and serving him tea to trying to waste the guy once it hits her hes not the phone-forgetting neighbor with car trouble hes claimed. A deadly game of cat-and-mouse ensues -- one that includes a sexy-scary shower scene and a brutal use of household items -- thats easy enough to get swept up in if you dont think too deeply. (Doesnt anyone ever turn on the news? And isnt Terrys toddler daughter astonishingly collected under such fraught circumstances?) Photos The 2014 Fall Movie Preview is a broad snapshot of films opening through Oct. 31. Release dates and other details as compiled here by Oliver Gettell are subject to change. As for the plot twist that supposedly caused Sony Pictures to at the 11th hour cancel the films one advance screening lest any previewer spill the beans (really?) its a pretty decent bombshell. Still you may guess it seconds before its revealed.calendarlatimes.com-----------------------------""No Good Deed""MPAA rating PG-13 for violence terror languageRunning time 1 hour 23 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Idris Elba Leslie Bibb Henry Simmons Read more movie reviews gt;gt; Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-no-good-deed-movie-review-20140913-story.html,200,nogooddeed1,nogooddeed,latimes
"No Good Deed - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire No Good Deed Posted by Christy Lemire on September 14 2014 6 Comments Sony Screen Gems Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence terror menace and for language. Running time 84 minutes. One star out of four. ""Do you want me to just tell you what the twist is?"" I asked my husband after going by myself to a Sunday-morning matinee of ""No Good Deed."" ""Cause youre never gonna see it."" ""Sure"" he said. The twist you see is supposedly such a crucial and startling thing that Sony decided critics couldnt possibly be trusted with it. Thats the official reason that media screenings nationwide were cancelled at the last minute this past week to preserve the element of surprise. This has got to be something truly groundbreaking along the lines of Bruce Willis being dead the whole time or Jaye Davidson having a penis or Rosebud being the name of a sled right? Not so much. I wouldnt dream of spoiling it for you guys. That just wouldnt be cool. But after laying it all out for Chris his response was ""Thats not a twist. Thats a plot point."" And hes right -- its not much of a twist. Its barely even a curve. Its more likely that Sony didnt want to be in the awkward position of promoting a film that features violence against women as a source of thrills given the release this week of a video clip showing Baltimore Ravens star running back Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee in the face in an elevator. (Not that the studios possible concern over bad PR mattered ""No Good Deed"" opened at No. 1 at the box office this weekend with 24.3 million.) Still director Sam Millers film is uncomfortable to watch (for a number of reasons) which would have been true regardless of timing. The blending of sex and violence is by no means a new phenomenon. The second a pretty young woman strips down and steps into the shower in a horror movie you know shes a goner. But ""No Good Deed"" practically fetishizes the brutality Idris Elbas character inflicts on a number of women. It sexualizes him as a killing machine. It wants us to salivate over him and tremble before him simultaneously. Because lets face it Hes Idris Elba. Miller working from a script by Aimee Lagos paints Elbas Colin Evans as a charismatic figure. Hes a cunning seducer -- although ""malignant narcissist"" is the official psychological label placed on the character. Colin is handsome and muscular charming and quick-witted -- but hes also a clever and has a taste for pain which makes him extremely dangerous. His victims and potential victims (the ones we see on screen at least) are all gorgeous too beautiful women with a variety of pleasing figures but a similar preference for tight suggestive clothing. Flirting often precedes the fury. Again were meant to be titllated and aghast in a single breath. In execution though ""No Good Deed"" is a rather standard home-invasion thriller. It telegraphs its scares and signals how were supposed to feel through a smothering intrusive score and rather obvious sound design (a thunderstorm a car alarm a window breaking). While its often more stomach-turning that frightening it also might not be crazy enough. Sure some of the characters make incredibly stupid choices but full-blown Tyler Perry-style wackiness would have been welcome. Instead the results are often just boring despite the best efforts of overqualified stars Elba and Taraji P. Henson. At the films start Colin is on the verge of being paroled from a Tennessee prison after serving five years for manslaughter. Were told in a lengthy and expository TV news voiceover that hed also been the suspect in the disappearances of five women although hed never been charged. On the way back to prison after his hearing Colin wipes out his guards and escapes. His destination is Atlanta where he pays a surprise visit to his ex-fiancee (Kate del Castillo) and learns that shes been involved with someone else in his absence. The beating he gives her is savage and bloody complete with an audible neck snap. ""No Good Deed"" returns to this moment in repeated flashbacks as if we needed a reminder of the rage that lurks within him. After crashing a stolen truck into a tree during a thunderstorm and suffering a bad cut on his forehead Colin knocks on the door of a beautiful home in an affluent suburb seeking help. Hensons Terri answers. Although shes busy with the bedtime routine for her young daughter and infant son she opens the door and graciously agrees to let him use her phone. Then she does something mind-blowingly idiotic especially given that her husband (Henry Simmons) is out of town for the weekend on a golf trip She invites this stranger inside. Ostensibly shes just a kindhearted woman but shes also been feeling lonely and unloved lately. Plus as we mentioned earlier Hes Idris Elba. And so Terri treats Colins cut. She gives him a dry shirt. She makes him tea. She listens to the sad tale of his broken engagement. When her sexually aggressive best friend (Leslie Bibb) comes over with a bottle of wine for a much-needed girls night she pours him a glass. She should know better and protect herself especially since she was a prosecutor specializing in crimes against women before choosing to be a stay-at-home mother. In no time Colin will show her his true colors and make her realize the enormous mistake she made by tormenting her and endangering her children (which is also difficult to watch). At its most sickening ""No Good Deed"" features Colin forcing Terri into the shower with him and then hovering over her wet and naked as he steps back into his jeans and makes her change clothes too. He is a specimen to behold -- hulking and chiseled -- but the sexually predatory nature of this act is inescapable. ""No Good Deed"" ultimately tries to be an inspiring movie about a woman rediscovering her power and protecting her family but by then its too late. The damage already has been done. Tweet Category Reviews Tags Henry Simmons Idris Elba Kate del Castillo Leslie Bibb Sam Miller Taraji P. Henson thriller violence 6 Comments on ""No Good Deed"" September 15 2014  by  Christin     Honestly this review is really reaching to find something bad to say; as all the pointS made about why is was bad arent even all the way true. It was oversexuallized? How? There was no sex in the entire film and idris character didnt even ATTEMPT to rape the main character or anyone else for that matter. The fact that they are ""sexualixing"" the brutality of women because idris looks good?? Come on. You said it yourself its idris. And that was the whole point. She would have never let a crazy looking person in the house. He was an attractive normal looking guy. Finally the fact that the women were wearing revealing clothing? I guess if you think t shirts and tank tops are revealing then sure. Might I add that youre wearing a tank top in the banner. Must be trying to titilate your readers. I really think this review was biased for whatever reason you must have a vendetta against either production or the actors because this review was outrageous. Reply September 28 2014  by  Michelle     Ditto Reply September 16 2014  by  Christy Lemire     Actually its not a tank top. Its a dress. Reply September 17 2014  by  observer     the stupidity of ""christins"" comment is too depressing to even merit a response. someone that dumb is not worth a reply. Im only commenting to point out that I seriously doubt you are ""christin"" more likely christopher or any other jackass male name. Reply September 30 2014  by  Martin McDonough     Christy makes a good point about the uncomfortable dicotomy of Elbas character being an attractive predator though I doubt the filmmakers were looking that deep into it. This is a glorified Lifetime movie. Reply Pingback No Good Deed-First he gets into your house.

Rating PG-13 (violence language) BOTTOM LINE Two fine actors wasted in a plodding thriller. CAST Idris Elba Taraji P. Henson LENGTH 130 Idris Elba a Golden Globe winner and Taraji P. Henson an Oscar nominee have somehow landed themselves in a pretty bad movie called ""No Good Deed."" How bad is it? The studio Screen Gems scheduled a screening for critics earlier this week and then thought better of it abruptly canceling the night before. The official reason given was a concern that the thrillers final plot-twist might leak out before the films release. What could it be? Elba plays Colin Evans a convicted killer who escapes from a Tennessee prison and makes his way to Atlanta. There on a dark and stormy night he seeks shelter at 17 Crescent Lane where Terry (Henson) is home alone with her grade-school daughter and newborn son. Posing as a stranded motorist Colin uses charm and flattery to get through Terrys door but it wont be long before things turn ugly. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Perhaps theres more to this situation than meets the eye. After all its an odd coincidence that Terry was once a prosecutor; her absent husband Jeffrey (Henry Simmons) is also a lawyer. After a glass or two of wine Colin mysteriously claims that hes met Terry before. Even Terrys neighbor Meg (Leslie Bibb) suspects a connection between them. Is it possible that Colin didnt commit the crimes hes been accused of? And is there any meaning to this movies portentous title? Director Sam Miller tries to liven up this ""Cape Fear"" knock-off with some shadowy lighting and a bit of sexual frisson between his two stars but there isnt much to be done about Aimee Lagos barely-there script. Elba spends a lot of time showing off his physique but rarely gets to flex his acting muscles while Hensons Terry is little more than a stick figure in distress. Cast and crew alike feel as though theyre limping along toward the movies end. Speaking of which the final plot twist is about as fiendishly clever as an episode of ""General Hospital.""

Henson and Idris Elba (Quantrell Colbert) C No Good Deed Genre Thriller; Starring Leslie Bibb Kate del Castillo Idris Elba Taraji P. Henson; Director Sam Miller; Release Date Wide 09/12/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 84; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted September 22 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT In No Good Deed a former lawyer who specialized in cases of violence against women unwittingly welcomes into her home an escaped convict with a history of terrorizing female victims. By the time this ex-con named Colin (Idris Elba) charms his way into Terris (Taraji P. Henson) Pottery Barn catalog of a home the audience is already well aware of his brutality. On the eve of his parole hearing at the beginning of the movie a Tennessee newscaster informs us that hes basically the most notorious criminal in the country suspected of abducting five women but convicted of an unrelated manslaughter. Hes denied parole escapes soon after and heads to Georgia to take care of some business which ultimately puts him on Terris doorstep. Why isnt she hip to the news that theres a criminal on the loose just one state away? Beats us. Still theres an intriguing premise buried in there that could have resulted in a smart look inside the mind of a malignant narcissist (which the movie reminds us over and over again was Jeffrey Dahmers diagnosis too). But No Good Deed chooses instead to operate as a fairly conventional home-invasion thriller. Much of the indulgent second act consists of making us wait--sometimes in true suspense but mostly in boredom--for Terri to figure out that this hulking man is actually a psychopath. Thats not to say Deed isnt gripping at times and the fact that Hensons character has to protect not only herself but an infant and kid too adds some interesting stakes to the final showdown. But with performers as strong as Henson and Elba and the guidance of director Sam Miller whos worked with Elba in a handful of Luther episodes it should have yielded more. The trite third act reveal only further sours the wasted potential.

Henson) and Colin (Idris Elba) in No Good Deed is expected. (Quantrell Colbert/Sony Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday September 12 2014 600 PM Title No Good Deed Film Info With Idris Elba Taraji P. Henson. A man terrorizes a mother. Director Sam Miller (124). PG-13 Violent images language sexuality children put in peril brutality. Area theaters. ""No Good Deed"" is an example of the worst kind of exploitative thriller -- and its being released during the worst possible week. This violent crass insulting movie is filled with images of domestic violence (albeit not between a married couple) just days after the world watched in horror as Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice was caught on surveillance camera hitting his then-fiancee now wife in an elevator. The courts decision and renewed scrutiny in the Oscar Pistorius case also helps cast the film in a bad light. The filmmakers of ""No Good Deed"" -- British director Sam Miller screenwriter Aimee Lagos and low-rent distributor Screen Gems -- certainly didnt intend a connection with their film which was of course made long before the Rice incident. But it makes it even tougher to watch this kind of offensive schlock which would still get zero stars no matter what was going on in the real world. Taraji P. Henson does the best she can with the weak role. (Quantrell Colbert/Sony Pictures) Taraji P. Henson stars as Terry an Atlanta attorney whos given up her career to raise her preschooler daughter and newborn son. Shortly after her husband has left town on a trip a stranger Colin (Idris Elba) knocks on her door on a stormy night claiming his car broke down and that he left his cell at home -- could she help? She tries to but of course various narrative roadblocks keep her in the house with Colin (he does after all fix her cars erratic alarm system a plot device destined to come up again later). As Colin prowls about the house scoping out family pictures and scowling menacingly Terrys friend Meg (Leslie Bibb) comes over an obvious sacrificial lamb to the storys slasher-flick tendencies. But then the preschool daughter and infant baby are also used as fodder for this disgusting movies notion of tension. The final-act ""twist"" is banal and expected not at all a mystery considering Colins early flashbacks to an earlier violent encounter. The performers of course deserve better. Elba - who worked with director Miller on the BBC series ""Luther"" - was a terrific Nelson Mandela in last years ""Mandela Long Walk to Freedom"" and was riveting on HBOs ""The Wire."" Here though Elba is required to do little beyond lurk in doorways and use his formidable size as a threat. Idris Elba is required to do little beyond lurk in doorways in the film. (Quantrell Colbert/Sony Pictures) Henson an Oscar nominee for ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and a delight in the ""Think Like a Man"" films is required to open her eyes wide in fear revulsion or shock. She has to shiver in showers and when Colin makes her turn around undressed plead with him that he ""doesnt have to do this."" few actresses could bring anything to a role like this; its amazing Henson is able to connect us to Terrys inner life at all. Theres no surprise to the ultimate victim-strikes-back final-act reversal. Henson and Elba wind up standing around looking bored as murkily-filmed wind rain and tree branches slam the windows lightning flashes and the audiences inner gross-out alarm - this still passes for ""entertainment""? Really? - goes off repeatedly. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE TRAILER.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jen Chaney September 12 2014 Follow chaneyj Screen Gems wants moviegoers to believe that ""No Good Deed"" contains a narrative twist so shocking that it will redefine the very notion of surprise itself. ""Get ready for the twist of a lifetime"" the studio announced in a tweet sent earlier this week shortly after all previously scheduled nationwide press screenings of the film were abruptly canceled in order to (allegedly) keep potential ticket buyers spoiler-free. Well heres a spoiler of sorts Yes there is a major twist in ""No Good Deed"" a thriller that stars Taraji P. Henson as a wife and mother terrorized relentlessly by a monstrous Idris Elba. But while some audience members may be blindsided by one particular third-act reveal its hardly the sort of ingenious storytelling trick that warrants J.J. Abrams-level secrecy. This review wont reveal what happens because to once again quote a Screen Gems tweet ""NoSpoilers."" But lets just say that you can easily find a more jaw-dropping twist by randomly viewing virtually any chapter of R. Kellys ""Trapped in the Closet."" The real truth about ""No Good Deed"" is that its just another stalker mystery in which impending danger is too obviously telegraphed by thunder claps and malfunctioning car alarms. The characters only vaguely resemble actual people and even charismatic actors such as Elba and Henson an Academy Award nominee and Howard University alum cant elevate the material into anything worth taking seriously. A few scenes succeed in generating legitimate tension but this movie isnt so much a nail-biter as a very occasional hangnail-chewer. An exposition-heavy news report that opens the film quickly dispenses with the full back story on Colin Evans (Elba). Hes a suspect in the disappearance of five women but was never charged. Hes in prison serving time for voluntary manslaughter after beating a man to death in a bar fight over Colins girlfriend. And hes determined to get out of prison an ambition thwarted when a parole board turns down his request for early release. After that disappointing hearing Colin takes matters (and guns) into his own hands killing two guards and escaping from the vehicle meant to transport him back to jail. His first post-escape stop the home of the girlfriend (Kate del Castillo) whose presence led to that bar fight. His second stop the home of Terri (Henson) an unhappily married mother of two who used to be a prosecutor specializing in cases involving violence against women. After Colin intentionally wrecks his car on a stormy night he shows up at Terris door explaining that he doesnt have his cell phone and needs to call for a tow truck. Terri home alone with her kids loans the handsome stranger her phone and eventually invites him in which seems like a pretty stupid move for a woman who surely saw her share of shady homicidal men during her career. But in her defense It was Idris Elba. And he was right there on her porch. There are three key questions that take center stage from that point forward 1. How long will it take for some serious you-know-what to start hitting some fans? (Not very.) 2. Why does Colin decide to target Terri? (Again NoSpoilers.) 3. Is it possible to watch Colin repeatedly and brutally attack several women including Terri without being reminded of the horrifying video of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking his then-fiancee unconscious? Given the degree of attention that video received this week particularly during ESPN broadcasts that often cut to commercials for ""No Good Deed"" the answer to that last one is a great big ""uh-uh"" which may explain why Screen Gems was actually so wary of screening this in advance. Clearly what happens in ""No Good Deed"" is fiction and is completely unrelated to the very real and upsetting events involving Rice. But after a week of hearing about a man who punched a woman in the face the last thing some people want to see on a weekend night is a man onscreen doing the exact same thing even when the woman he strikes has no qualms about striking back.

Share Tweet ""Theres a storm coming"" a minor character informs stay-at-home mom Terri (Taraji P. Henson) towards the beginning of the home-invasion thriller No Good Deed. Its a clunky bit of portent but barely registers as such because the movie has spent its opening minutes annihilating the very concept of portent. As coiled prisoner Colin Evans (Idris Elba) rides to his parole hearing a newscaster breathlessly reports on his weirdly specific criminal circumstances before the parole hearing scene offers even more expository detail. The movie is hell-bent on not just hinting that something might be slightly amiss with the charismatic Colin but specifically diagnosing him as a ""malignant narcissist"" on par with Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer. When he shows up at Terris door in the middle of the awkwardly teased thunderstorm asking to use her phone theres no room for suspicion This is a bad man whether Terri knows it or not. In theory explaining upfront (and then swiftly luridly illustrating) that Colin is a dangerous psychopath could adhere to the oft-cited Hitchcock principle of showing two characters at a table unaware that theres a ticking timebomb underneath it--only in this case Elba plays the bomb Henson plays the table and there arent really any characters at least none with any traits beyond ""good"" and ""bad."" Elba and Henson could of course do more if given the chance. When she first cautiously invites Colin into her home Terri--vaguely annoyed at her stiff of a husband (Henry Simmons) for leaving on a golf trip--talks to her guest like they just met at a bar. Its foolhardy but Elbas cool authority and a few gestures from Henson (the way she quickly adjusts her hair in the mirror) sell the flirtation at least momentarily.A shame then that the movie insists on conveying Colins shaky grasp on his sanity with shock edits that flash back to Colins misdeeds and interrupt the actors flow. Even in simple dialogue exchanges the movies strategy of leaving almost no mystery to Elbas character undermines any accumulation of suspense. (It also undermines the screenplays early assertions about Colins seductive ability to appear rational and calm because he seems unable to stay calm for more than a few minutes before flying into a homicidal rage.) What might have been seductive scenes with an undercurrent of menace become an exercise in time-killing.That sense of menace never arrives even when No Good Deed punches into hardcore thriller mode; it has no patience for anything but the most obvious jolts. Elba can be scary but there arent any layers to his madness. Henson at least gets to be a craftier and more physically aggressive version of the woman in distress but the movie isnt really interested in its characters just their boilerplate circumstances. Director Sam Miller who worked with Elba on the TV series Luther seems to think that a hasty cobbling together of creaking floorboards surprise stabbings and baby endangerment will be enough to tighten up the suspense in the final stretch. Its not. By its end No Good Deed becomes troublingly easy to read as a parable about the untrustworthiness of black men. The filmmakers may not have intended it that way but the movie is so bereft of anything else that its forays into moralistic paranoia stick out. Share Tweet Filed Under Film Idris Elba Taraji P.

Daily Edition Login to download No Good Deed Film Review 1056 AM PDT 9/12/2014 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Sony Pictures This one certainly doesnt go unpunished at least for the audience TWITTER Idris Elba and Taraji P. Henson play a cat and mouse game in this home invasion thriller Earlier this week the press screenings of No Good Deed were canceled with a mere 12 hours notice the cited reason being that the film contains a ""plot twist that we do not want to reveal as it will affect the audiences experience when they see the film in theaters."" So if you do plan on seeing the film spoiler alert because the plot twist is... Just kidding. Actually the explanation seems a bit disingenuous regarding this formulaic home invasion thriller because the plot twist is no big deal. The more likely reason for the sudden change of heart is that the film isnt very good or possibly because its repeated scenes of a strapping man brutally beating various women have an unfortunate resonance in light of a recent well-publicized news story. Said man is Colin (Idris Elba) whose backstory is helpfully explained in the opening moments via a breathless news reporters commentary. A suspected serial killer of five women he instead wound up in prison for five years on a manslaughter charge after a barroom brawl that resulted in the death of his opponent. Denied parole on the grounds that hes a ""malignant narcissist"" he quickly engineers a breakout while being transferred back to prison. His first stop is the home of his ex-girlfriend (Kate Del Castillo) with the reunion not at all going well for her. After crashing his car and gashing his head during a violent rainstorm Colin winds up on the doorstep of Terry (Taraji P. Henson) alone at home with her two young children while her inattentive husband (Henry Simmons) is away on a golfing trip. Although Terry is revealed to be a former prosecuting attorney specializing in cases involving violence toward women she nonetheless soon agrees to let the wet and bleeding man in. But then again this is Idris Elba were talking about. Cue the resulting tension as the initially gentlemanly and considerate Colin begins demonstrating an off-kilter intensity. The arrival of Terrys best friend and randy neighbor Meg (Leslie Bibb) briefly alleviates the uneasiness with the trio sitting down to glasses of red wine and sexual tension permeating the atmosphere. But it isnt long before Colin reveals his true sociopathic colors and all hell breaks loose. With the film conveniently set on a dark and stormy night director Sam Miller ups the anxiety quotient with such fake scares as car alarms repeatedly going off and a tree branch suddenly breaking a window. More interestingly the obvious sexual attraction between Colin and Terry is accentuated when he forces her into the shower with him although she remains fully clothed while he casually gets naked. Aimee Lagos screenplay is otherwise devoid of interesting elements with its endless scenes of Terry turning the tables on her tormentor and inflicting physical punishments on him before he quickly recovers and gains control. While Henson is obviously in prime physical shape the sight of her repeatedly getting the jump on the strapping Elba becomes increasingly ridiculous especially since his characters formidableness has been established from the beginning. Elba who recruited his former Luther director Miller into the project gives the film more dignity than it deserves and Henson delivers a performance of complex emotional shadings. But their fine work is utterly wasted in this B-movie exploitation thriller that would barely make for passable viewing on late-night cable television.

Henson in this routine thriller. ""No Good Deed"" is a mediocre thriller starring Idris Elba as an escaped con terrorizing a housewife (Taraji P. Henson) on the proverbial dark and stormy night. Opened in the U.S. and Canada by Sony without press previews and reportedly shot more than two years ago this uninspired effort has nonetheless performed above expectations and is projected to gross as high as 25 million by the end of its Sept. 12 opening weekend. Colin Evans (Elba) was strongly suspected of guilt in the disappearance and presumed deaths of five young women but evidence could only be found to convict him on one barroom-brawl manslaughter charge. Five years later hes up for parole but when the board reviewing his case denies his release he violently escapes from the van taking him back to prison. After paying a visit to a former g.f. (Kate del Castillo) whos understandably not at all pleased to see him he crashes his stolen car and lands on the suburban Georgia doorstep of Hensons Terri. Shes a former state prosecutor turned unhappy stay-at-home mom to two young children particularly since her lawyer husband (Henry Simmons) neglects them all. As hes taken off for a golfing weekend shes alone with the kids when Colin shows up pretending to be an innocent crash victim who just needs to call a tow truck. After a long buildup in which Terris flirtatious BFF Alexis (Leslie Bibb) stops by for a predictably ill-fated ""girls night"" our heroine begins to grasp shes dealing with one very dangerous ""malignant narcissist"" (as a court expert put it) at around the 50-minute mark. The ensuing action is tamely PG-13 in terms of graphic violence and despite competent performances and packaging the dialogue and situations in Aimee Lagos script are too routine to create much excitement. Nor does Brit TV veteran Sam Miller (making his first theatrical feature in 15 years) contribute much in the way of notable style atmosphere or suspense. With tech/design contributions equally pro but undistinguished the overall effect is dullish and forgettable. Film Review No Good DeedReviewed at Rainbow Market Square Cinemas Toronto Sept. 12 2014.

This movie was good suspensful and intense. It wont win an Oscar but come on...critics never seem to enjoy what the audience enjoys. Moments in the movie the ENTIRE audience was screaming or rooting. It was a very good movie. I recommend it Reply douglass says September 13 2014 at 941 am The movie was great must be some movie politics in motion for anyone giving this movie a bad review. LOVED IT....and I normally dnt love movies. Reply Quinton says September 13 2014 at 233 am To be honest I thought the movie was quite good. Kept me on the edge of my seat literally until the end. Idris played crazy very well. Taraji showed me a different layer of her acting. Overall I really enjoyed NGD. Reply Ive seen worse.......... says September 12 2014 at 146 pm No Good Deed is certainly not the best movie ever made and it probably will not win any awards or be nominated for Oscars but I personally enjoyed seeing two extremely talented and notably qualified actors on the big screen at a movie theater in my city. Regrettably seeing Taraji P. Henson and Idris Elba was a marvelous exception rather than a normal occurrence since Hollywood is neither known for or prone to extend the same opportunities to actors of all races and persuasions. Henson and Elba together as bonus were more refreshing with substandard material and direction than a lot of other garbarge Hollywood produces for the masses. No Good Deed was remarkable for all the wrong reasons attributed to years and years of exclusion and injustice. I hope the box office receipts for the movie are profitable in spite of negative reviews. It was good to see movie about black people who are not slaves.

Henson. 153 Shares Share 126 Tweet 26 Share 1 Share Email Print Share Photo Screen Gems Productions Allow me briefly to engage in some critical inside baseball. Two days ago reviewers across the country received an email saying that the press screening of the home-invasion thriller No Good Deed had been canceled because the studio was concerned that a big twist in the film would be revealed. Since plenty of films with big twists have successfully screened to critics without being ruined this seemed to many of us like nonsense -- a lame excuse to keep press from seeing what was probably a terrible film. So as I and many other critics trudged our way to midnight screenings of No Good Deed last night there were two questions on our minds (1) How bad is it? and (2) Whats the twist? Dont worry I wont tell you what the twist is other than to say that its not particularly noteworthy and actually has precious little to do with the plot. As for the film Well its certainly not good. But its not entirely dire. It stars Idris Elba (The Wire Mandela Pacific Rim) as Colin Evans a suspected serial killer who was imprisoned for the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter (he accidentally killed a guy in a bar fight). We open on Colins parole hearing where he tries to claim that hes been rehabilitated and feels deep shame at the fact that he took another mans life ""Ive been in the correctional system for five years and that is exactly what I am -- corrected"" he tells them. Alas there are plenty of people convinced that Colin did in fact abduct and kill those young women so his parole is denied. But on the way back to the prison he manages to grab ahold of his guards and escapes. After briefly dispensing with his ex-girlfriend (""I just want you to forgive me"" he says right before strangling her and then bashing her head in with a lamp) he winds up one cold and stormy night at the home of Terri (Taraji P. Henson) an overworked mother of two whose somewhat distracted husband is away on a golf trip. Pretending to have car trouble and asking for a phone Colin manages to gain Terris trust and works his way into the house. Elba and Henson are both wonderful actors and they do what they can with what little psychological back and forth theyve been provided. He has remarkably kind eyes which make you want to believe him even when you know the worst is true but the way he casually dominates the spaces of Terris McMansion also speaks to a slowly gathering alpha-male menace. Even so both actors are being curiously wasted. I dont know anything about this films history and yet I couldnt help but wonder if at some point during production Colins guilt was left uncertain Why give us a parole hearing otherwise? Why assert that he was never convicted of the murders otherwise? Why go to the trouble of showing him having an actual car accident otherwise? Why cast Idris Elba in the part otherwise? Why even bother having the movie otherwise? But by making it clear very early on that Colin is a ruthless murderer the film shoots itself in the foot It makes Hensons character look like a trusting fool. The alternative would have been more interesting more alive with possibility. What if the film kept us guessing as to Colins true motives and his guilt even as we ourselves were pulled towards him -- mirroring Terris own attraction to him? What if it bothered to actually make us wonder what was going to happen next instead of telegraphing everything? I realize that Im doing that thing one should never do imagining a different movie instead of the one before us. But I wouldnt be surprised if that imaginary movie didnt exist at some point instead of the sadistic mess that is No Good Deed.

Henson Dont Embarrass Themselves or Their Studio in a Perfectly Serviceable Thriller Movies | By    Inkoo Kang on September 12 2014  902 am Email Print Related Idris Elba in Talks to Star in Guy Ritchies Knights of the Roundtable King Arthur Idris Elba Goes to War in First Look at Cary Fukunagas Beasts of No Nation (Photo) Idris Elba to Voice Killer Tiger in Jon Favreaus Jungle Book for Disney Henson makes for a sexy and tragic protagonist in this women-empowerment thriller about domestic violence but Elba plays a troubling stereotype in this film that Screen Gems decided at the last minute not to screen for critics Like this summers ""Lets Be Cops"" and 2012s ""The Watch"" two high-concept comedies that lost their allure after Ferguson and the killing of Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman respectively the home-invasion thriller ""No Good Deed"" arrives at an inopportune time. Press screenings for the film were canceled at the eleventh hour citing concerns that critics might spoil a major plot twist but its hard not to wonder whether it was the parallels between the thriller and the recently emerged Ray Rice video that made Sony fearful of early reviews. ""No Good Deed"" is a film distrustful of men and for good reason. Its wicked villain is serial killer Colin Evans (Idris Elba) a narcissistic neo-Othello with a vicious need to control every woman around him and an automatic disinterest in any conversation that tries to pass the Bechdel test since theyre not about him. (Hes so vain he probably thinks this film is about him.) Also read Dolphin Tale 2 Should Dunk No Good Deed and Guardians at Box Office This Weekend Colins quickness to violence renders him a problematic character. Hes a stereotype of the brutally misogynistic black man a fact that makes both the character and the physical aggression on screen difficult to watch. An early scene in which strangles his ex-girlfriend then batters her corpse in unwaning anger borders on sickening. To the films credit that act doesnt feel gratuitous but rather part of a larger commentary about domestic violence as when a prison guard friendly to Colin dismisses the allegations that he has murdered five women by shrugging it off as the convicts ""women trouble."" Also read Taraji P. Henson Says Her Oscar-Nominated Fat Ass Can Get a Table But Not Hollywoods Respect Elba is never quite seductive or menacing enough to make Colin compelling but ""No Good Deed"" doesnt really care about evil just about battling it. Good Samaritan Terri (Taraji P. Henson) is the sucker who invites an injured Colin into her home and its entirely because of Hensons innate likability and charm that this film works at all. A frazzled unhappy stay-at-home mother of two very young children Terri is an everywoman who stays with a man she should leave. Her lawyer husband (Henry Simmons) away on an out-of-town trip isnt a monster like Colin but there are clear similarities between Terri and her guests other victims. Sam Millers direction is exploitative of both genders theres sexual tension as Colin and Terri furtively appreciate each others physiques giving way to the tragedy that hes primarily attracted to her because shes lonely and insecure. Miller directed six episodes of Elbas lurid BBC detective series ""Luther"" but little of that shows sensationalistic style -- or any visual style -- is on display here. Also read Idris Elba Thriller No Good Deed Launches Unique Social Media Campaign Screenwriter Aimee Lagos knows the way mapping out a throughline of femme-powerment but doesnt have very many landmarks to show us between Points A and B. Much of the scant 84-minute running time is wasted on loud noises a crash here a car alarm there. The arrival of Terris independent and successful best friend Meg (Leslie Bibb) adroitly turns a break in the tension into one of the films darkest scenes by illustrating just how close to the surface Colins cruelty and sadism lie. When he guzzles red wine while the women politely sip you can almost see him turning into a vampire. As for that mysterious plot twist? If Im thinking of the right one its nothing thatll  be remembered by the end of this perfectly serviceable thriller. And if nothing else ""No Good Deed"" is a great preview for what Henson might bring to a much more interesting role as a hip-hop matriarch in TVs ""Empire."" Breaking News To Your Inbox.
