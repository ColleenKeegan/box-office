Emily Blunt as an evil snow queen a shameless grown-up knock-off of Elsa from Frozen two years after she was cool. Chris Hemsworth as an axe-wielding huntsman and Jessica Chastain as his bow-wielding ex-wife both sporting hammy Scottish brogues. On the surface The Huntsman Winters War a bizarre fantasy epic hitting theaters this weekend had all the trappings of a camp classic but as the film quickly reveals it has none of the fun. Related Story Snow White and the Huntsman The Visuals Dazzle the Performances Dont Why the movie which seeks to continue the (very much concluded) tale of Snow Whites triumph over her mirror-obsessed stepmother exists at all is one of those big Hollywood quandaries. It nominally follows Snow White and the Huntsman the 2012 surprise hit that turned the classic fairy tale into a CGI-laden military brouhaha but its title character (played by Kristen Stewart) is absent. Without Stewart its pretty unlikely this entry will turn much of a profit; beyond that it struggles to justify its own existence from the most basic story perspective. Franchises may be Hollywoods current obsession but youd be hard-pressed to find a viewer desperate to learn the origin story of Snow Whites helpful Huntsman.But learn it you do The Huntsman Winters War is not only a sequel but also a sort of prequel filling in the backstory of Hemsworths titular character who spent most of the first movie toting two hand-axes and flashing the camera with an occasional wicked grin. It turns out he was a child soldier enlisted to the cause of the wicked ice queen Freya (Blunt) sister to Ravenna (Theron) the evil queen who eventually met her end at Snow Whites blade. Confused? You should be. The ice queens inclusion seems like a lame gimmick and a misuse of Blunts extensive talents on a role thats both familiar to audiences (thanks to Disneys Frozen) and firmly in the public domain (Hans Christian Andersens ""The Snow Queen"").The Huntsman also known as Eric falls for a salty warrior named Sara (Chastain). But Freya her heart hardened by her own personal tragedies splits them up and exiles Eric who thinks Saras dead. The film clunkily written by Craig Mazin and Evan Spiliotopoulos then endeavors to remind viewers of the last entrys story as it cuts several years ahead reuniting Eric and Sara as they seek to take down Freya and reclaim her sisters magic mirror which still holds her vicious essence. The plot should really be beside the point--whatever audience this film has is watching for the loopy visuals and surprisingly stacked cast not the hodgepodge remixed fairy tale being told.But this strange prequel/sequel approach is so belabored it continually grinds the film to a halt trying to explain just who everyone is and what theyre doing there. Many questions go unanswered--why are Chastain and Hemsworth Scottish? Why do we get only four dwarves (two played by the excellent British comic actors Nick Frost and Rob Brydon utterly wasted) this time around? Just why does this film take so long to bring Theron back into the mix when shes clearly its ace card the only one who knows how to have any fun amidst all the boring action sequences? Like its predecessor The Huntsman Winters War is a cartoonish creation set in no particular time or place but its CGI embellishments do nothing to lend it any real character.Snow White and the Huntsman was goofy but it had its charms mostly hinging on Stewarts strange brand of superstar stoicism Therons amped-up supervillainy and some nicely surreal visuals (the magic mirror was an anthropomorphic pile of golden glop that would spill out onto the Queens lush carpet). The Huntsman Winters War is directed by the last films visual-effects supervisor Cedric Nicolas-Troyan. As a VFX master hes clearly a top-notch hire but this is his first directing gig and it shows ... painfully. Blunt is a tremendous actress but she seems lost at sea amid the green screen. Chastain and Hemsworth two of Hollywoods most charming performers have all the romantic chemistry of two people who literally just met.Perhaps The Huntsman Winters War was intended to start a new franchise one that smashed together every available childrens story into a complicated universe of Oscar nominees cashing big paychecks. It fails not even providing satisfying action or arresting visualizations of magic in its nearly two-hour running time; beyond that it doesnt give its talented cast much to work with. When people gripe about Hollywoods reliance on sequels and cheap franchise cash-ins this is the kind of movie they mean no Grimms Fairy Tale but a grim tale nonetheless.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

"Huntsman The Winters War | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; huntsman-the-winter-s-war ) Huntsman The Winters War (United States 2016) April 22 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli When Snow White and the Huntsman was released four years ago it successfully transformed one of movie-doms beloved fairy tales (known primarily through the Disney animated classic) into a fantasy adventure. The Huntsman Winters War a part-prequel/part-sequel ventures deeper into Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter territory without considering one basic rule of epic fantasy length is a prerequisite to properly tell a story of this sort. Character arcs and plot points need to unfold over the course of hours not minutes.  Theres a reason Peter Jacksons adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkiens trilogy spanned nine hours and it took eight films to bring J.K. Rowlings vision to the screen. By cramming far too much material into 114 minutes The Huntsman Winters War feels rushed and incomplete. It doesnt help that the screenplay is at times awful forcing accomplished actors to recite excruciatingly bad dialogue while maintaining a straight face. To be fair its not all bad. Many elements of an effective fantasy adventure are in place although theyre hampered by questionable execution. Individual scenes are effectively choreographed but the need to rush robs them of their capacity to thrill and excite. There are also some odd casting choices. Due to the decision not to bring back Kristin Stewart Snow White doesnt appear (except in a brief cameo where her face isnt shown). And only one dwarf Nion (Nick Frost) joins this movies quest. Based on his antics hes either ""Dopey"" or ""Grumpy."" The first third of The Huntsman Winters War transpires prior to the 2012 movie and provides background about how The Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) became The Huntsman and how Queen Revenna (Charlize Theron) stole the throne and turned her loving mild-mannered sister Freya (Emily Blunt) into the Ice Queen of the North. Were also introduced to The Huntsmans wife Sara (Jessica Chastain) who at least according to Snow White and the Huntsman was dead by the time that film took place. About 40 minutes into The Huntsman Winters War events jump ahead seven years and were into the sequel portion of the narrative. The magic mirror has been stolen and The Huntsman must retrieve it before it falls into Freyas hands. Joining him on this quest are a quartet of dwarves including the aforementioned Nion and the back-from-the-dead (sort-of) Sara. The Huntsmans objectives are (1) retrieve the mirror (2) defeat Freya before she becomes all-powerful and grinds Snow Whites kingdom underfoot and (3) reawaken the spark of ""true love"" in Saras heart. The female component of the cast is nothing if not accomplished.  Among them Charlize Theron Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain have accumulated four Oscar nominations twelve Golden Globe nominations and four BAFTA nominations (winning quite a few along the way). The Huntsman Winters War isnt going to increase the number. Therons over-the-top approach to Ravenna matches her performance from Snow White and the Huntsman. Emily Blunt is more restrained and succeeds at least to a degree in making Freya a quasi-tragic figure. Jessica Chastain manages not to appear bored. Chris Hemsworth is as invested as he needs to be for a stopgap between Thor movies. The production design appears to have been influenced more by Maleficent than The Lord of the Rings. The arguing dwarves are on hand to provide the obligatory ""comedic"" moments that are supposed to lighten the apocalyptic implications of Freyas plans. That might work if their banter was less inane and more genuinely humorous. As it is they are irritating encumbrances whose superfluous nature becomes apparent with the approach of the climax. By incorporating indirect references to Frozen and making ""true love"" an important theme The Huntsman Winters War hopes to win the hearts of younger female viewers. Its a desperate ploy and the awkwardness with which it pursues this aim compromises the films structure. Its possible to show love in ways other than having characters talk incessantly about it. It would be unfair to argue that there was no room for a sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman. The problem with The Huntsman Winters War isnt a lack of ideas but an inability to fuse them into a compelling story that draws on the strengths of its predecessor rather than incorporating tropes into an unsatisfying mass of fantasy adventure mediocrity.

Entertainment Charlize Theron Basically Eats ""The Huntsman Winters War"" And Then The World But theres not enough of her in this prequel/sequel which ditches Kristen Stewart to focus on Chris Hemsworths Huntsman. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron in The Hunstman Winters War. Universal Pictures ID 8500716 Kristen Stewart has left the building -- the castle the kingdom the whole damn fantasy world.The actor was one of the two stars of 2012s Snow White and the Huntsman but she doesnt appear in The Huntsman Winters War. Nor does her character Snow White save for a single scene in which another actor with hands over her face appears as a wordless stand-in. Neither Stewart nor Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders was brought back for the combination prequel/sequel opening a decision that when initially announced was seen as an attempt to distance the movie from the pairs extracurricular scandal.But now that The Huntsman Winters War which is centered on the first films male lead Chris Hemsworth is hitting theaters the decision to dump Stewart aligns all too neatly with TVs recent similar shucking off of ""troublesome"" female leads while retaining the men. Thats how discardable women continue to be regarded as -- a gal can get booted from her own goddamn fairy tale. Or maybe ""interchangeable"" is the better word since Jessica Chastain steps into the requisite formfitting body armor to be the movies replacement warrior chick.Well weep not for K. Stew whos gone on to far more interesting (if less profitable) roles in the years since Snow White and the Huntsman. Maybe spare a tear for screenwriters Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazin whove crafted an awkward write-around in which Snow White gives out orders while being ""too sick"" to show up onscreen in anything but that aforementioned momentary flashback. The Huntsman Winters War is the directorial debut of Snow White and the Huntsmans VFX supervisor Cedric Nicolas-Troyan and it marries the first movies dark twist on Snow White with a loose twist on The Snow Queen. Its a move so nakedly calculating that its kind of endearing because what follows is effectively a gritty take on Frozen in which the sisters are the villains. In addition to Charlize Theron back as Queen Ravenna Emily Blunt is introduced as her sibling Freya whose wintry powers manifest after she loses her paramour and child in one night and as all magical ice queens must heads north to spread snow everywhere and build a crystalline spire in the mountains. She unfortunately doesnt get to enjoy a musical number in which she literally lets her hair down but she does have a spy-owl. View this image > Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain. Universal Pictures ID 8500847 Freya in her chilly retreat also kidnaps -- or in her words saves -- children from their families and forces them to be part of her army which is where Hemsworths Huntsman whos been given a name (Eric) has his forbidden romance with Sara (Chastain) whos his equal on the battlefield. Then theres a tragic death -- or is there? -- and the movie skips ahead to after Snow White and the Huntsmans happy ending when Eric is told that Ravennas malevolent magic mirror has gone missing and must be retrieved and disposed of One Ring-style. Hes accompanied on the mission by a pair of male dwarves (Nick Frost and Rob Brydon) and then a pair of female dwarves (Alexandra Roach and Sheridan Smith) join up and they fight a bunch of goblins who look like gorillas with horns. Multiple characters come back from the dead and Freya shows up riding some sort of snow leopard-polar bear hybrid and makes the whole mission pointless.But none of that really matters because the great delight of The Huntsman Winters War is Charlize Theron who as Ravenna seems damn near ready to eat the entire movie as an amuse-bouche before devouring the world. Ravenna in her golden finery and gilded makeup appears to have wandered out of the most evil Dior perfume ad ever. She throws her head back when she cackles wears finger claws around the house and plays games of chess in which the penalty for losing is death. She later goes full-on T-1000 except she forms herself out of liquid gold -- no cool-toned metal for her. She and Freya seem to go around acquiring kingdoms out of compulsive habit because what else are wicked queens supposed to do with their time?Also her backstory has been hand-waved away. In Snow White and the Huntsman like Maleficent there were traces of a rape-revenge history to Ravenna who used her magically enhanced vampiric beauty as a weapon against the type of powerful men who ""ruined"" her and killed her mother. In The Huntsman Winters War those traces of intriguing if warped psychology have been traded in for a distasteful suggestion that these women have both been driven mad by the absence of lovers and children in their lives two sorceress spinsters embittered by envy or grief. View this image > Emily Blunt and her snow leopard-polar bear hybrid. Universal Pictures ID 8500870 The sourness of that characterization is still more compelling than the romance between Eric and Sara which its contrasted with. The impediments to the two Huntspeople getting together seem like they could be resolved by a 30-second conversation but instead are stretched over an interminable Charlize-less middle section filled with much trekking through fields and forests.Hemsworth is brawnily charismatic and Chastain makes for a tersely no-nonsense action heroine but theirs is no star-crossed love story -- their characters are too boring too trapped into exasperating choices. Eric and Saras stretches of bickery flirting have nothing on the delicious campiness of the moment in which Freya and Ravenna tiff over whose territory theyre currently occupying (""This is my kingdom"" Freya snaps). If everyones expendable in this franchise but also no one stays dead heres hoping that any future installment ditches the Huntsman the way that Snow White was shunted aside because the evil queens are where its at.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 22 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 22 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan Written by Evan Spiliotopoulos Craig Mazin and Evan Daugherty Starring Chris Hemsworth Charlize Theron Jessica Chastain and Emily Blunt Classification 14A Country USA Language English Pity the little children who venture out to the movies these days; their cheery fables and simple tales have been turned into dark sagas for young adults. Jungle Book has gone all grown-up the stories of Snow White and the Snow Queen are rated PG-13 and Game of Thrones has a lot to answer for.The Huntsman Winters War is being billed as the prequel to 2012s Snow White and the Huntsman although it is also and primarily a sequel. The first was a baroque retelling of the Snow White myth that rejoiced in a scenery-chewing performance from Charlize Theron as the wicked queen Ravenna. The critics didnt think much of Kristen Stewarts blandly activist Snow White but the box office was solid and so this brazen retread simply banishes Stewart from the action while also ditching director Rupert Sanders (who had a notorious on-set affair with Stewart for which she later publicly apologized). New writers working from the characters created by Evan Daugherty spend a tight first act explaining the antecedents of the huntsman who rescued Snow White but most of the movie follows his adventures seven years later after Ravennas death. Knowing a good thing when they see it the movies producers bring Theron roaring back from the dead and the script throws in a slightly less evil sister Freya played by a gracious if less than fully engaged Emily Blunt.As the writers turn from Snow White to Hans Christian Andersens Snow Queen story (or perhaps Disneys Frozen) a jilted Freya creates perpetual winter in an icy kingdom where she rules over kidnapped children who she trains to become hardened soldiers forbidden to feel love. Of course one of them is our hunstman (Chris Hemsworth) who predictably falls head over heels for a colleague the steely archer Sara (Jessica Chastain).Yes this is a very crowded place and although filled with willful women and powered by three female leads viewers must rely on Hemsworths winsome huntsman to lead us. Thankfully he is matched with a woman off whom he can actually raise some sparks in the person of a fiery Chastain - and accompanied by four moderately amusing dwarfs played by full-sized British character actors once again made small through digital trickery.Villainy now a distractingly two-headed beast is less satisfactorily presented as Therons routine grows stale yet still manages to eclipse Blunt in a final scene where director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan loses his previously firm grip on the story and its emotions. Meanwhile the special effects - walls of ice and rivers of gold - are impressive but there is nothing here to match Therons fantastical transformation into a flock of crows in the previous movie.Unlike the smarter Maleficent a revisionist Sleeping Beauty created by the same producers what The Huntsman series lacks is any intriguing psychology. Freya is given the barest veil of a backstory while Ravenna just oozes ribbons of black bile (literally) for her own evil reasons. These women may be strong but they are never deep.

Or maybe its a slog around them as Snow White is talked about plenty on screen but Kristen Stewart is nowhere to be seen. (Perhaps her mirror offered her some sound career advice.)Here we catch up with Charlize Theron as evil queen Raveena and her sister Queen Freya (Emily Blunt) whose ability to manipulate ice and snow will be familiar to anyone who has seen ""Frozen.""Freya is vehemently anti-love and forbids it in her kingdom. So when Eric (Chris Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain) -- two soldiers she has raised since childhood to be her loyal army -- fall in love Freya chases them from her kingdom.Hemsworth only showing glimpses of his self-effacing charm has no spark with Chastain and theyre locked in a forced tug-of-war most of the film. Theyre joined on their journey back to the kingdom by two dwarves (Nick Frost and Rob Brydon) who are to comic relief what Theron is to most of the film noticeably absent.Director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan working with special effects that barely would have passed muster 20 years ago cant mask the movies nagging lack of necessity.

That these lads and lasses were given swords and staffs instructed in martial arts (gleaned by repeat viewings of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon?) and dispatched to slay the enemy and expand the realm? Heres the best bit In the magic land of sprites and goblins depicted in this over-the-top prequel to 2012s Snow White and the Huntsman the kids with the killer skill-sets grow up to become Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain. They are Eric and Sara they speak in the thickest of brogues and when they kickbox leg-lock and head-butt their sorry army of opponents their long tresses whip poetically in the forest mist. Aye its a beautiful thing - her red braids his Thor-y locks. Hairdresser heaven There are actually two maniacal monarchs in The Hunstman Winters War. One is familiar from Snow White and the Huntsman Ravenna queen of the dark arts played with regal looniness by Charlize Theron. She would eat her young. She would eat the scenery too - and does. The other is new Ravennas sister Freya (Emily Blunt) who is with child - a child the Magic Mirror informs Ravenna who will grow to be more beautiful than she. That simply wont do. Infanticide is in order. The death of Freyas baby turns her heart to stone or rather to ice. ""Consumed by grief and anger"" (thanks Liam Neeson uncredited narrator) she makes a kingdom or a queendom of her own. If she cannot raise a child Freya will raise an army. Hence Eric and Sara and all the other wee younguns who will grow up to bow before Her Frosty Majesty. Jump ahead a few years. Its unclear at this point if The Huntsman Winters War has shifted from prequel to sequel. The name of Snow White is invoked but apart from a momentary glimpse in the Magic Mirror at the beginning of the film Kristen Stewart who starred in the 2012 hit and who ran off with Hemsworth does not appear. Here Eric the Huntsman has eyes only for Sara the Huntswoman and it is their mission to retrieve the Magic Mirror which has been stolen. Complications a quartet of dwarfs and various battles and betrayals follow forthwith. Despite its title The Huntsman Winters War is decidedly femme-centric. Theron and Blunt (who gets her own signature line of silvery gowns) are the dueling representatives of evil and power lust. Chastain proves herself an adept fighter and wearer of Game of Thrones-like leather wear. And along with the comic relief provided by the male dwarfs Gryff and Nion (CGI-stunted Rob Brydon and Nick Frost) comes that of the female dwarfs Bromwyn and Doreena (Sheridan Smith and Alexandra Roach). Doreena in particular will not be pushed around - she boldly puts the moves on Hemsworths Eric. Whats to lose? Sampling Tolkien Disney and Grimm The Huntsman Winters War lays on the pastiche in slabs but no one is slouching here. Theron proves the master of operatic hissy fits Blunt lets the pain show beneath the glacial cool Chastain brings her usual Juilliard-schooled commitment to the occasion and Hemsworth is Hemsworthian if oft-times incomprehensible delivering his lines in a gorse-y whorl of vowels and consonants. But whatever it was he was saying Sara seems to understand. ""Youre a right galoot"" she tells her huntsman. ""So are you"" is his snappy retort. sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629 The Huntsman Winters WarDirected by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan. With Emily Blunt Jessica Chastain Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron.

"The Huntsman Winters War is a fairy tale in search of a tale to tell - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Huntsman Winters War is a fairy tale in search of a tale to tell Review The Huntsman Winters War is a fairy tale in search of a tale to tell Giles Keyte Eric the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) and warrior Sara (Jessica Chastain) lie in wait in ""The Huntsman Winters War."" Eric the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) and warrior Sara (Jessica Chastain) lie in wait in ""The Huntsman Winters War."" (Giles Keyte) Rebecca KeeganContact Reporter One trick of great fantasy storytelling is establishing the rules of the world -- in ""The Lord of the Rings"" hobbits fear adventure; in ""Harry Potter"" Muggles cant perform magic; in ""Avatar"" humans cant breathe on Pandora. From those limitations come sympathetic characters and a story with a real sense of peril.There are no discernible rules in the world of ""The Huntsman Winters War"" a dreadful sequel to 2012s darkly appealing ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" In the pale update nearly every major character dies and comes back to life at least once and a convoluted narrative yields not a single palpable moment of drama. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Not even the considerable charm of Chris Hemsworth who plays the seemingly immortal ax-wielding title hero or Emily Blunt as an ice queen with head-scratching motives can save this dull mash-up of fantasy genre cliches which wastes its A-list actors stunning costumes and computer-generated artistry on a fatuous story with zero stakes.The 2012 film directed by Rupert Sanders mostly succeeded as a visually rich retelling of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale with Kristen Stewart playing Snow White as a brave warrior princess and Charlize Theron delivering a deliciously over-the-top evil Queen Ravenna. The new movie written by Craig Mazin and Evan Spiliotopoulos and directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan leaves out Stewarts role. Really its a Snow White movie without Snow White -- can you imagine Iron Man putting up with that?Set both before and after the events of the first film ""The Huntsman Winters War"" stars Blunt and Theron as Freya and Ravenna a pair of rivalrous royal sisters -- think ""Frozens"" Anna and Elsa with better eye makeup and worse attitudes. Ravenna mostly stares in the mirror and makes malevolent declarations. Freya who starts the film in love and quickly suffers a trauma begins shooting ice out of her hands wearing metallic headpieces and training an army of child soldiers.

Speaking in muddled Scottish accents and wearing cute leather hunting outfits (perhaps theyre hunting for the plot?) Eric and Sara fall in love and try unsuccessfully to escape Freyas icy grasp.Over the next hour Hemsworth swashbuckles through six or seven plot reversals and multiple inscrutable fight scenes. He is joined by some bickering dwarves Nion (Nick Frost) and Gryff (Rob Brydon) and becomes determined to capture Ravennas magic mirror. Wait is Ravenna dead? Whos alive? Who knows? Who cares? Its raining and cellos are playing so something bad must be happening. Though the cast are all pros who do their darndest to deliver the bewilderingly bad dialogue with conviction even an Oscar winner like Theron cant sell lines like ""A humble pawn can bring down kingdoms.""Nicolas-Troyan who had been the visual effects supervisor on ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is making his directorial debut here and there are moments that help explain how he got the job. When Eric and his merry band end up in a computer-generated forest its a gorgeous magical place where giant moss-covered tortoises roam and butterflies flutter.

"The Huntsman Winters War review Sequel misses its target - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Huntsman Winters War review Sequel misses its target The Huntsman Winters War trailer ""The Huntsman Winters War"" trailer (YouTube) ""The Huntsman Winters War"" trailer (YouTube) Katie WalshTribune News Service How do you solve a problem like Kristen (Stewart)? If youre the filmmakers of ""The Huntsman Winters War"" you write Snow White entirely out of the sequel to ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" The films clearly a valuable property so its no wonder that Universal would return to that well with a sequel this time directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan the visual effects supervisor on the first film. But the script acrobatics result in a bizarre prequel/sequel mash up where Snow White doesnt show up in her own fairy tale. The film focuses on two of the best elements from the first film Charlize Therons wickedly beautiful and scheming Ravenna a queen who desires power and to be the fairest of them all and Chris Hemsworths ruggedly hunky ax-throwing huntsman Eric. Added to the mix is Ravennas sister Freya (Emily Blunt) a literal ice queen; and Sara (Jessica Chastain) a fellow huntsman and Erics true love. RELATED MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOURIn the prequel portion Freya suffers a devastating loss at the hands of her lover which causes her to spontaneously transform into ice. She retreats to the North to rule as the Ice Queen where she wears fabulously glittery gowns and builds an army by kidnapping children and forcing them to become her huntsmen (and women). Eric and Sara fall in love there but Freya jaded has only one rule no love. In the sequel part heralded by a ""7 years later"" title Eric and Sara have been driven apart Ravennas been dispatched and Freya is on a kingdom-conquering kid-snatching roll. The tricky mirror-mirror has gone missing too and Erics got to get his hands on it before Freya does. The film feels disjointed and lackluster for the majority. The scenes and character introductions feel random the time jump implausible and no one is all that compelling especially the lone male lead Hemsworth. The huntsman in ""The Huntsman"" is the least interesting part of this movie though theres some entertainment to be found in Hemsworths accent his best impression of Gerard Butler. It also seems as if the writers of ""The Huntsman Winters War"" have been catching up on ""Game of Thrones"" because there are a few uncanny similarities Chastains arrow slinging Sara sports a ridiculous Scottish accent to match Jon Snows girlfriend Ygritte and the stormy lovers have to scale ice walls. Worthy of George R.R. Martin? Nah queen. One bright spot in the film are the dwarves used for comic relief. Once you get past the digital shrinking of the actors and the low-brow humor they inject a much-needed levity and Sheridan Smith almost steals the whole show as the sassy Mrs. Bromwyn. The visual effects naturally are truly amazing particularly the shape-shifting liquid gold of the mirror. Every time Charlize Theron is on screen the movie gets crazy campy and therefore at least somewhat interesting. Ultimately the film presents a message that emotional vulnerability can be a source of strength. Its a bit self-help-y but by the end it feels somewhat earned. Shockingly its not through the relationship of Eric and Sara but through the feuding sister queens. Even though theyre battling with ice crystals and stabby tentacles the resentments and revelations between them feel authentic. However and despite all the talent involved this ""Huntsman"" wildly misses its target. ""THE HUNTSMAN WINTERS WAR"" - 2 stars MPAA Rating PG-13 for fantasy action violence and some sensuality.

The movie is also as vacuous silly and boring as Hemsworth is awkward and awful in the title role. Stating the obvious gorgeous visuals are pointless if the story is as stupid and the characters are as lame as they are here. So there is no way to recommend this prequel/sequel to the 2012 fairytale fantasy adventure Snow White and the Huntsman. As everyone knows already Kristen Stewart did not reprise her role as Snow White because of an on-set scandal. The original director Rupert Sanders was also discarded. He was replaced by another first-timer Cedric Nicolas-Troyan the Oscar-nominated special effects supervisor on the 2012 movie. He also apprenticed as a second unit director on Maleficent in 2014. With Nicolas-Troyan in charge of Winters War it is little wonder that the visuals are splendid except when he and his team cheaped out on the troupe of trolls who attack Hemsworth and company at a key point in the so-called plot (which is narrated by an uncredited Liam Neeson to make it all sound more self-important). Despite the reported 115 million budget little seems to have been spent on making trolls credible; instead plenty was devoted to an ice palace and its arctic environs as well as cool special effects involving liquid gold the legendary Magic Mirror Queen Ravennas transformations and her sister Queen Freyas icy finger spells. Like the first movie this prequel/sequel freely mines fairytales for its characters its medieval fantasy milieu and its reliance on sorcery and fantastical creatures. Specifically there are references to the Brothers Grimm tales on Snow White; in addition Hans Christian Andersens The Snow Queen is invoked although in dramatically different and darker ways than Walt Disney Studios did in Frozen. The prequel part of Winters War charts how Queen Freya (Emily Blunt) lost her first-born but gained her evil sorceress powers and became the Ice Queen. She spends years establishing her army of ruthless warriors by murdering peasants kidnapping their children and training them in the loveless ways of the sword bow and battle axe. Regardless of gender they grow up as hardened Huntsmen. Eric is one of these warrior slaves. We see him develop from puberty (when he is played by Conrad Khan) to restless adulthood (Hemsworth wise-cracking and head-smashing with wild abandon). Similarly Sara develops from shy young girl (Niamh Walter) into a fiercely independent fighter (Jessica Chastain talking in a heavy phoney brogue). Eric and Sara go rogue from the Ice Queens grim rule when they fall in love and marry. Tragedy ensues. That is when the prequel leaps seven years and goes past Snow White and the Huntsman as a sequel involving the resurrection of Ravenna (Charlize Theron) and the fate of Freya (Emily Blunt). Hemsworth gets four dwarfs as comic sidekicks Nick Frost returns as Nion; Sam Claflin shows up as his half-brother Gryff; while Sheridan Smith and Alexandra Roach appear as tiny imperfect love interests. There are a torrent of tasteless little-people jokes. With dwarfs trolls sorcery a gloomy tavern fight and an ice palace that looks eerily like a snowbound Mordor Winters War borrows heavily from The Lord of the Rings. But this movie steals only visual references without the majesty complex dialogue and compelling characters of Peter Jacksons trilogy. It reminds us how storytelling trumps special effects every time -- a bitter tea to swallow for the filmmakers who hacked out The Huntsman Winters War. Twitter Bruce_Kirkland BKirklandpostmedia.com Sponsored Links See All Sponsored Links The Huntsman Winters War review Pointless sequel bound to bore By Bruce Kirkland Postmedia Network First posted Thursday April 21 2016 1209 PM EDT | Updated Thursday April 21 2016 0258 PM EDT The Huntsman Winters War is as beautiful as its macho lead actor Chris Hemsworth is handsome. The movie is also as vacuous silly and boring as Hemsworth is awkward and awful in the title role. Stating the obvious gorgeous visuals are pointless if the story is as stupid and the characters are as lame as they are here. So there is no way to recommend this prequel/sequel to the 2012 fairytale fantasy adventure Snow White and the Huntsman. As everyone knows already Kristen Stewart did not reprise her role as Snow White because of an on-set scandal. The original director Rupert Sanders was also discarded. He was replaced by another first-timer Cedric Nicolas-Troyan the Oscar-nominated special effects supervisor on the 2012 movie. He also apprenticed as a second unit director on Maleficent in 2014. With Nicolas-Troyan in charge of Winters War it is little wonder that the visuals are splendid except when he and his team cheaped out on the troupe of trol Also in this article The Huntsman Winters War trailer Top stories Popular Latest Videos Mayor John Tory kicks off the dancing at start of Caribbean Carnival parade Police ID man killed in rooming house No winning ticket for Friday nights 60 million Lotto Max jackpot Ottawa Pokemon Go player among first to catch all North American Pokemon Kanye West drops Wolves music video Police ID man killed in rooming house Bullets fly at Christie Pits park boot camp Osheaga 2016 Live coverage Mayor John Tory kicks off the dancing at start of Caribbean Carnival parade Ottawa Pokemon Go player among first to catch all North American Pokemon Forcillo Sentencing TTC Surveillance Footage of Sammy Yatim Shooting Woman calls out sexual harassment on subway Long Plain First Nations chief addresses band following tornado on reserve Ford back at city hall More from Movies Suicide Squad Who are the villains populating DCs next hit?

Giles Keyte/Courtesy of Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Giles Keyte/Courtesy of Universal Pictures Queen Freya (Emily Blunt) and Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) in the story that came before Snow White The Huntsman Winters War. Giles Keyte/Courtesy of Universal Pictures A Snow White tale without Snow White is like an apple without its core. Yet here we are four years after the minor financial success of the Kristen Stewart-led Snow White and the Huntsman gazing into the mirror without the dark-haired beauty. The first film had somewhat grand ambitions in trying to reclaim Disneyfied fairy tales for older Grimm fans. But this sequel has a different motivation one which becomes apparent as soon as Emily Blunt unleashes ice from her lungs and dons a wardrobe of bright blue scaly dresses. Yes The Huntsman Winters War is here for the Frozen assets that have suddenly made Hans Christian Andersens two-century-old tale The Snow Queen look like very lucrative property. In their bid to ape a rivals success Universal Studios seems to have chosen the closest available wicked queen with whom they could defrost this new mythology. Thus Charlize Therons gold-plated evil empress Ravenna now has a sister in Blunts fragile ice Midas Queen Freya. In the films opening third set before the events of the first movie Freya discovers her cold hands after a personal tragedy and flees to a kingdom in the North. If the phrase ""kingdom in the North"" conjures up images of a certain Wall perhaps one guarded by a ragtag team of warriors with shifting allegiances rest assured this movie knows something of that parallel just as its aware of the other one. The desire to prompt a Pavlovian response from Game of Thrones fans extends even to the casting of a leather-bound Jessica Chastain as ""Sara"" a fiery redhead warrior whos gifted with a bow and enjoys making love in the hot springs. Like the other soldiers in Freyas huntsmen army Sara was an orphan trained from childhood to serve the queen though the film provides zero sense of what life was like growing up in a year-round winter boot camp. (Did they ever get sick of snowball fights?) Chastain is a powerhouse of an actress and shes brought added depth to supernatural roles when called to as in her terrifying performance in last years Crimson Peak. But how many ways are there to play a character fairy-tale or not whos written as an unlicensed copy? About all she can do is break Freyas one ironclad rule of the North No one is permitted to love. When Sara falls for the strapping Eric (a returning Chris Hemsworth still charming and rugged and wielding an axe as though it were a certain hammer) theres frozen-over hell to pay. We are then thrust forward in the timeline seven years so that Eric can go on the hunt for Freya and reconnect with his one true love after all that other Snow White stuff has happened to him. He gets assistance once again from the local dwarf population with Nick Frost making a return alongside three new faces all superimposed onto smaller bodies for our mild amusement. The script by two credited writers bears all the hallmarks of a rush job especially when you take a gander at co-headliner Ravenna and realize she serves no narrative purpose (which might be why Theron has so little screentime that she hardly gets to snarl). First-time feature director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan was a special effects supervisor on the first Huntsman film yet theres no visual splendor to be found in the kingdom this go-around. At one point Erics party gets menaced by some brown goblins who look like theyre fresh from a mud bath. At least Nicolas-Troyan doesnt try to cover up the films lack of Stewart We see ""Snow White"" once from the back and the rest of the time she is only alluded to in passing since it is still technically her reign. Its too bad someone with the name ""Snow"" would probably get along swimmingly with the Snow Queen. There would be use for a properly dark Frozen retelling more in line with the original tale where the afflicted actually uses her power for malfeasance. But Freya is a snow day late and a dollar short. By the time we learn just how deep her abilities run its too late to do anything with them. Her lack of true gumption in a land of supposedly unhinged magic people prompts another question Whats the point of all the blood sexy costumes and PG-13 sensuality when the theme of the movie (Love Conquers All) is so childish? If youre going to murder a baby in the first act and hint at the possibility of actual black magic at work to then handle the rest of the narrative with the same kid gloves as the cartoons do is insulting -- and the Thrones comparison this film wants to prompt looks even more embarrassing. Heck the Frozen comparison is embarrassing too. At least that version knew it was for children.

"The Huntsman Winters War is like Frozen without the fun review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Huntsman Winters War is like Frozen without the fun reviewThe producers who brought you Maleficent desperately wish they could have done so again. Instead of another good Sleeping Beauty spinoff theyve settled for a bad Snow White one.Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron star in The Huntsman Winters War.  (Universal Pictures / TNS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 21 2016The Huntsman Winters WarStarring Emily Blunt Charlize Theron Chris Hemsworth Jessica Chastain Rob Brydon and Nick Frost. Directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan. At GTA theatres. 114 minutes. PGThe producers who brought you Maleficent desperately wish they could have done so again. Instead of another good Sleeping Beauty spinoff theyve settled for a bad Snow White one.The Huntsman Winters War is the regrettable outcome. More a collection of gaudily violent set pieces than an actual movie directed by excitable effects man Cedric Nicolas-Troyan it serves as both a talent-squandering prequel and sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman while doing nothing more than name-check Snow White.Article Continued BelowYes Kristen Stewarts central character isnt in the movie arguably the smartest thing shes done in her career. Its not so great for the film mind you which is a bit like buying a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert and finding Taylors off on vacation leaving her backing band to serenade the audience.There is plenty of snow courtesy of Emily Blunts ice queen Freya who responds to shocking betrayal by turning people into vanilla Popsicles and decorating her northern lair with giant ice crystals. She has also outlawed happiness and love leaving a sense of desolation that will be familiar to anyone forced to sit through this mess which has been filmed in the dismal gray-green colours beloved by CGI boffins. Its Frozen without the fun. Freya has been egged-on into icy disdain by her nastier sister Ravenna (Charlize Theron) who spews out a dark lethal substance resembling chocolate sauce. (These two together should be called the Dairy Queens; I kept thinking of sundaes all through the movie.)Ravennas rage is due to the Magic Mirror a device shaped like a giant golden serving dish that is even less subtle than Botox. If the darned thing would only learn to lie to the ""Whos the fairest of them all?"" question a whole lot of blood chocolate sauce and snow would cease to flow and fall.Which brings us to Eric the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) a grinning dullard with an axe who falls for feisty warrior Sara (Jessica Chastain) defying Freyas anti-love edict. These two bond over their Scottish accents which are atrocious. A group of dwarves -- played by Rob Brydon Nick Frost Alexandra Roach and Sheridan Smith -- enter the film and try to turn to liven up the proceedings. Theyre good for a few laughs but theyre three dwarves short of a Snow White picnic and thats the least of this pictures problems.

Also starring Jessica Chasten and Emily Blunt. Directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan (""Snow White and the Huntsman""). In theaters April 22. (Credit Universal Pictures) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In the years before the tale of Snow White Eric the Huntsman battles the Ice Queen Freya.CAST Chris Hemsworth Jessica Chastain Charlize TheronRATED PG-13 (strong action and violence)LENGTH 154BOTTOM LINE A surprise improvement over 2012s turgid ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" the 2012 fantasy-adventure starring Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth in the title roles was a bit like this years box-office hit ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" Nobody really liked it but everybody saw it anyway. Does that make ""The Huntsman Winters War"" one of this years most anticipated sequels or one of the least? At any rate here it is -- its technically a prequel -- and its an improvement over the first film. (Is that a surprise or is that not saying much? So many questions.) ""The Huntsman"" tells a new story tethered to an old fairy tale that was tweaked to begin with which means this overstuffed movie constantly struggles to make any thematic or narrative sense. That it even barely succeeds is impressive. advertisement | advertise on newsday Theres enough happening in ""The Huntsman"" to sustain several movies. In addition to the familiar evil Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron hamming it up beautifully) there is her emotionally wounded sister the Ice Queen Freya (a very good Emily Blunt). Freyas army of Huntsmen obey a single law ""Do not love"" Ah but the law is broken by young Eric (Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain). Flash forward seven years and the banished Eric undertakes a noble task To find Ravennas stolen mirror. Wait what? When? Why? Pay no attention to the screenwriters behind the curtain Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazin were hired to thread all these elements together a futile task they perform heroically. Their distractions include four double-dating dwarves (Nick Frost and Sheridan Smith are the standouts) a menacing Goblin king and many opportunities for Hemsworth to work his charm and for Chastain to show her physical prowess. When the cracks in this movie show which is often the gorgeous special effects serve as glue. Debut director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan is an Oscar-nominated effects man who worked on ""Snow White"" and he may have learned from that experience to keep the pacing quick and to lighten up on the Goth-rock attitude. Overall ""The Huntsman Winters War"" feels like a movie that didnt need making but at least it justifies it existence. MoviesMovies with the most sequels Snow White-inspired filmsThough Snow White doesnt appear in ""The Huntsman Winters War"" her presence is felt throughout the movie which has its roots in the classic fairy tale. Here are four other films in which Snow Whites inspiration is evident even though her names never mentioned. BALL OF FIRE (1941) -- In this hip spin on ""Snow White"" Barbara Stanwyck played a pure-as-the-driven-slush nightclub singer who takes refuge from the police in the home of seven stuffy professors. She finds her Prince Charming in the form of a naive linguist (Gary Cooper).NINE TO FIVE (1980) -- Lily Tomlin took Snow White down a lethal path when she imagined herself as the fairy-tale princess during a marijuana-induced hallucination about poisoning her male-chauvinist pig boss (Dabney Coleman).SYDNEY WHITE (2007) -- A freshman (Amanda Bynes) gets schooled in the college of hard knocks by a snooty sorority. Coming to the rescue is a group of seven misfits who take her in. The movies alternate title is ""Sydney White and the Seven Dorks.""ENCHANTED (2007) -- Amy Adams played a Snow White-ish princess named Giselle who gets exiled to New York City by an evil queen (Susan Sarandon). There she warbles while she works with some city critters and falls for a handsome lawyer (Patrick Dempsey).-- Daniel Bubbeo Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Am I right parents? ""The Huntsman Winters War"" is here to remedy that giving us an ice queen (Emily Blunt) who prefers enslaving children to belting out musical numbers. Her sister (Charlize Theron) is the wicked queen of this films predecessor 2012s so-so ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" and shes around this time just long enough to outshine everyone else -- literally as shes so swathed in gold that she looks like a malevolent Oscar statuette. The entirely unnecessary ""Huntsman"" from debut feature director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan functions as both prequel and sequel. Blunts Freya is introduced as the nicer homebody sister of Ravenna (Theron); shes thrilled to be having a child with an illicit boyfriend until her baby is murdered in its crib releasing her inner Evil Elsa and sending her north to raise her own icy kingdom. (The cold never bothered her anyway.) Freyas mission to abduct children and turn them into an army. Her one rule Nobody should go falling in love with anybody else because love is for suckers. Unfortunately two of her abductees grow up to be Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain as champion warriors Eric and Sara who cant keep their hands off each other and are banished each led to believe the other is gone for good. This incoherent screenplay seems to have been written by a roomful of the gorilla-like trolls who show up in the movie at one point. It flails along in odd arrhythmic tangents about how that famous magical mirror has gone rogue after Ravennas defeat by Snow White -- it seems to be touring around the countryside on its own -- and how Eric and Sara must reunite and get it before Freya does but without looking at it (because as everyone knows the way to trap a Hemsworth is by compelling him to look at his own reflection). Minor comic relief is provided by the team of British comics Nick Frost and Rob Brydon as two snarky dwarves whom I would very much have liked to follow off on an entirely different adventure -- preferably one that involves fine dining and impressions. Its unclear who exactly this film is aimed at Its too violent for younger kids while older ones will likely roll their eyes. And its hard to imagine adults eagerly awaiting the new season of ""Game of Thrones"" will consider this an acceptable placeholder despite its similar million-shades-of-gray palette and medieval getups. Whats a real drag here is the waste of three formidable actresses in first-rate Comic-Con gear -- Chastain is channeling a kind of high-couture ""Xena Warrior Princess"" look -- obscured behind underwhelming CGI dull dialogue and a title that only gives credence to the man in the story.

With ""The Huntsman Winters War"" thought we kind of get both a sequel and a prequel in this less-than-satisfying if occasionally entertaining fantasy romp that does feature some of the more talented actors on the planet. On the positive side ""Winters War"" showcases slickly produced special effects and often heart-pounding action sequences. The exquisite costumes created by three-time Academy Award-winning designer Colleen Atwood -- especially those gowns flounced about in by Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt -- are worthy of garnering Ms. Atwood a fourth Oscar to add to her jam-packed trophy shelves. If a review has to begin by lauding the costumes as among a films best qualities doesnt that mean were in for a bit of a negative ride? Yes that is the case with ""The Huntsman Winters War."" While the visuals for this movie are often first-rate in watching it I continuously felt the storyline -- or really the frequently confusing multiple storylines -- left me as cold as the chilly demeanor that comes to define Blunts Freya the Ice Queen. The screenplay officially penned by Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazin comes across as emotionally stark and without the depth of feeling that one wants to experience from a fairy tale. More importantly one doesnt feel much empathy for the heroes here despite yeoman-like performances by Chris Hemsworth as Eric the title character Huntsman or Jessica Chastain as his lady love Sara. Besides as indicated above this tale launches us off in a new direction then provides a seven-year gap (while we metaphorically go backward so the events of the original film can play out) and then bolts us ahead in a contorted journey that involves the once-gentle Freya turning icy after her infant daughter is burned alive by her lover (Robert Wilfort) to avoid marrying her. Freya heads to the north establishing her romance-killing kingdom supported by an army of abducted child warriors. Some of the best moments in this film are when Blunts Freya and Therons Evil Queen Ravenna face off against each other -- providing some pretty delicious diva-esque banter that adds the kind of spice we relish from scenes such as these. The mishmash of filmmaking makes it clear this was a movie made by committee -- and clearly that committee was composed of folks who were not all on the same page when it came to spinning what could have been a much more engaging piece of fantasy storytelling.  Universal Pictures presents a film directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan and written by Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazin. Running time 114 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for fantasy action violence and some sensuality). Opens Friday at local theaters.

(Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures) Mirror mirror on the wall -- did anyone ask for this sequel at all? Billed as ""the story before Snow White"" (and the sequel to the 400-million global box office hit ""Snow White and the Huntsman"") ""The Huntsman Winters War"" is a serviceable sometimes funny often visually beautiful film that is both harmless and unnecessary. The first act of the movie assumes that you havent seen the original film relying heavily on narrator Liam Neeson for exposition. We are reminded how Snow White (Kristen Stewart) and the huntsman previously defeated the bloodthirsty Ravenna (Charlize Theron) granting Snow White rightful control of her kingdom. We then dive into the prequel portion of the film where we discover that Ravennas sweeter sister Freya (Emily Blunt) has not yet realized her powers. When Ravenna learns from her magical mirror that Freyas daughter will one day threaten her title -- ""fairest of them all"" -- she hatches a murderous plan. The rest of the movies plot can be gleaned from the trailer ""To escape the pain of her loss the good queen built a fortress of ice around her heart. If she could not raise a child she would raise an army."" The titular huntsman Eric (Chris Hemsworth) grows up under Freyas rule as a child soldier. Though love is expressly forbidden here a man as charming and goofy as Hemsworth cannot go unwanted for long and he soon falls for Sara (a tough Scottish-accented Jessica Chastain) his comrade in arms with a deadly accurate bow and arrow. When Freya in her fabulous chain-mail capes and generally stunning costuming (thanks to designer Colleen Atwood) discovers that two of her warriors are in love she sends Eric away. According to Neeson thats when the events of ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" transpire and so we jump forward by seven years. (L to R) Queen Freya (Emily Blunt) and her sister Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron). (Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures) Ravennas mirror continues to haunt Snow White who tries to get rid of it; she sends it away under armed guard but it is stolen en route. Tasked with finding the mirror before it reaches Freya and bestows unlimited power on her Eric sets off on an adventure filled with magical mishaps and newfound friends. The quest for the mirror represents a complete tonal shift in the film but its for the better. Erics chemistry with Sara is rivaled by his banter with a band of dwarves (all of whom notably are played by CGI versions of tall actors). Comedic lines are delightfully self-aware and range from an attempt by a she-dwarf (played by the hilarious Sheridan Smith) to get Eric to take his shirt off to the huntsmans catastrophic fall down a series of roofs.""This is the worst plan ever"" he remarks to himself. While the funny action-packed sequences are the best parts they are indicative of the films main problems an inability to focus and an overly complicated plot. The first third of the film shows children learning to murder indiscriminately while the second third is an adventure-comedy. Blunt plays her part believably -- shes both heartbroken and vengeful -- while Theron outright chews the scenery. ""Winters War"" ultimately treads a line between a slightly funnier version of ""The Hunger Games"" and a half-Gothic ""Frozen."" When Freya discovers her ice powers and her hair turns white you almost expect her to break into ""Let It Go."" The film seems a bit unsure of itself and its direction leading to an ending that -- while ambiguous -- signals a certain confidence about one thing another sequel. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains fantasy action violence and some sensuality. 114 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

First off theres no Kristen Stewart in this one so tick that off the list. You dont need to see it for the half-Game of Thrones half-Middle Earth production design an extravagant mingling of depressive forests and frosty ice-migraine landscapes. You wont be missing much if you forego the ""I love you I hate you I love you"" romance between career fairytale-gothic warriors Eric and Sara (Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain) who toss one another about brutally before succumbing to the dull inevitability of romance. You dont even really need to see it for Nick Frost and Rob Brydons turn as randy wisecracking dwarves though you wonder if given just a bit more latitude they might have subverted the movies deadening squareness. No theres only one reason to see The Huntsman Winters War Gowns Insane off-the-hook gowns. Gowns trimmed with netting grommets and spikes. Gowns with enormous winged gilt-feathered collars gowns that pour from the shoulder like liquid steel gowns whose bodices look to have been made from pleated metal. Embroidery chain mail jewels metallic paillettes You name it these gowns have it further augmented by crowns as jagged as murder weapons towering hairweaves that would make Marie Antoinette weep and more dangly earrings than youd find at three shopping malls worth of Claires. Did I mention the heavy-metal prosthetic talons? These outlandish creations courtesy of veteran costume designer Colleen Atwood nearly upstage the actresses who wear them Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt who star as royal sisters dueling for power. (Chastain because shes a warrior gets no gowns and instead must wear drab practical forest-worthy leather jumpsuits.) The Huntsman Winters War tells the pre-Snow White backstory Long before Snow came on the scene Therons Queen Ravenna was using her wicked wiles to grab kingdoms by the handful. In an early scene we see her playing a lethal game of chess with an aged king while wearing nothing but a tiara and a sequin-trimmed mini-robe. Clearly hes toast. Ravennas greed and ambition ultimately alienate her from her sweeter more straight-shooting sister Blunts Freya. After the quintessential betrayal Freya turns into an ice queen who can freeze stuff with her eyes. She also has a mask of ice-feathers that turns her into an all-seeing all-hearing owl and she gets to ride a fearsome creature that looks like a cross between a polar bear and a tiger. I guess youd call it a polar biger. All of that makes The Huntsman Winters War sound like more fun than it is. Gowns aside this things a snooze Events unfold tediously and there are many scenes in which extras with dirty faces playing demoralized townsfolk mill about in a desultory fashion. In the end this is your stock boring fairytale fable about the battle between good and evil between the haves and the have-nots. No wonder Blunt and Therons gown-wearing sisters--definitely in the ""have"" camp--are the hands-down winners. Would you rather be them or the actor playing Uncredited Yurt Villager? I rest my case.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Last month his glum reaction to terrible reviews of ""Batman v Superman"" made a video meme sensation out of Sad Ben Affleck. What trending image of celebrity gloom can we expect from ""The Huntsman Winters War""? Joyless Jessica Chastain? Bleak Emily Blunt? Resume-ripping Charlize Theron? I hope not. They are excellent actresses ensnared in a ferociously bad movie. Their online melancholy would be ingrained in our consciousness far past memories of the film which should evaporate in the opening weekend. Forget the subtitle right now It doesnt even deliver a war The film is a ludicrous prequel/sequel to 2012s ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" which was itself a fractured fairy tale that needed extensive troubleshooting. The new film is also a shameless rip-off of ""Frozen"" featuring rival royal sisters in a squabble one a magical ice queen capable of throwing endless chunks of permafrost. It shoplifts characters themes physics-defying stunts visual images and ideas from the Disney childrens hit. For extra fun it uses them in a fairy realm where children are either born out of wedlock beaten kidnapped turned into lethal child soldiers or killed themselves -- or all of the above. The characters do not burst into song with ""Let It Go"" though audiences will feel that way. This shamelessly illogical story begins as a long prelude before the first films tale abruptly time-machines forward seven years at the halfway mark then limps ahead until 123 minutes and countless wristwatch checks have passed. Chris Hemsworth returns to his title role and his awful ""Aye lassie"" approximation of a Scottish drawl as well. Theron reappears as evil queen Ravenna launching an emotional feud with her magic-princess sister Freya (Blunt) who has engaged in forbidden love. When Ravenna ends Freyas relationship in a deeply villainous way -- the arch-cynic insists love is a delusion -- the younger woman becomes exceptionally wicked herself. She jealously spies on lovebirds through a mechanical owl transmitting its sight to her magical bird mask. And she creates a sort of evil Hogwarts academy snatching tykes and turning them into ax-swinging anti-romance gladiators. Feed Loader Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron. Naturally the child who will become Hemsworths character falls for Sara a little scrapper growing up into action heroine Jessica Chastain. She has a brogue even more daft than his and an ability to leap in the air capture an enemys neck between her thighs and head-scissor him to the ground in a way that a Marvel superheroine would applaud; clearly theyre kindred spirits. As you might expect their hidden love does not have Freya planning a wedding shower. Blunts character is mostly dignified drawn to destruction and death because she is heartbroken about her own long lost love. Against her woe-is-me sadness (perhaps triggered by her tedious dialogue) stands Therons serious-as-a-CAT-scan rottenness. While Blunt plays a semi-shy wallflower Theron is a particularly carnivorous Venus fly trap. The scripts time-lapse structure means that although Snow White causes the diabolical Ravenna to wither and die off-screen she is on hand here and there pre- and post-fatality shooting shards of sharp black glass out of her gown when shes cross. There are also actors playing dwarfs through computer-generated shrinkage and here the film showcases its only genuinely entertaining asset. The remarkable Sheridan Smith makes a surprisingly good character-driven role out a throwaway part turning the petite mercenary into a scene-driving 50-amp jolt of energy every time she appears on the screen. Shes edgy belligerent vulgar powerful and appealing at the same time smarter than the guys in ways that make her the strongest female in the cast. She delivers a put-down like ""I expect you to stand there and look ugly and not much else"" with battle-ax impact. Heres hoping the industry recognizes what she delivers here and forgets the rest. This is a film that doesnt even obtain mediocrity. This is the industrial-grade level of bad that only can be enjoyed by fans who watch films ironically for hipster laughs. For the rest of us viewing it is like snacking on popcorn you found on the floor. At one point Hemsworths character battered by his clumsy attempt to storm an enemy village groans ""This is the worst plan ever."" I think what he meant was ""film.""

The story borrows from Frozen -- semi-close sisters one of whom has a chilly heart and abilities to match -- and Lord of the Rings -- the wicked mirror corrupts those who carry it -- but still manages to sell its central conceit the way personal tragedy can color the whole world especially when youre strong enough to make everyone share your heartbreak. (Paint it...white?) It turns out wicked queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron dripping venom from every syllable) had a sister named Freya (Emily Blunt muted by pain) and the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth mugging) had a wife (Jessica Chastain glowering). It also turns out that dwarves can be used for comic relief even when theyre feeling amorous. But even the good bits lack zip and verve and the bad bits leave you wondering why director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan (who did visual effects on the first entry) isnt doing more with the super-powered sibling rivalry that clearly and rightly sparks his interest. 2016. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

The film is a sequel and prequel to ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" but the story is disjointed and ultimately unnecessary.In ""The Huntsman Winters War"" Sara (Jessica Chastain) and Eric (Chris Hemsworth) are forbidden to love. Of course they would be.(Photo Giles Keyte)Story HighlightsCritics rating 2 out of 5 stars""The Huntsman Winters War"" is both a prequel and a sequel to ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" and if that sounds confusing and unnecessary well welcome to the movie.Snow White (Kristen Stewart in the 2012 film) is gone from both the title and the film but the evil queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) is back (and back again which will make sense once youve seen the film). The Huntsman also known as Eric (Chris Hemsworth) returns as well. New additions include Emily Blunt as Queen Freya and Jessica Chastain as Sara a huntswoman as it were.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Long before Snow White was in the picture the evil queen had another worthy rival her sister. The Huntsman Winters War stars Charlize Theron Chris Hemsworth Jessica Chastain and Emily Blunt. VPC""There is another story one you have not yet seen"" a narrator explains (threatens?) at the outset. (Its an uncredited Liam Neeson.) This one involves more treachery from Ravenna who kills off yet another royal husband and takes over another kingdom (this is before the Snow White story takes place). Her sister Freya is on hand but doesnt seem to have the cutthroat ambition -- literal youd assume if need be -- of Ravenna. Freya is more romantic and finds herself pregnant.Unspeakable tragedy ensues and she grows cold. Like Queen Elsa in ""Frozen"" cold. She freezes things with her newfound supernatural powers which evidently run in the family. She heads north to run her own kingdom and sets about conquering others. Freya likes to steal children from villages train them to be great warriors and forbid them from showing or feeling love. Its not exactly Disneyland over at her place.RELATED How movie The Huntsman got its nameTwo of these children grow up to be Eric and Sara the best fighters and not for nothing the ones with movie-star good looks. They fall for each other but Freya cant abide that. She punishes them each in their own way and seven years pass during which time Ravenna meets her fate at the hands of Snow White.In ""The Huntsman Winters War"" Freya (Emily Blunt left) and Ravenna (Charlize Theron) are sisters with a bad case of sibling rivalry. Thats so Marcia and Jan Brady isnt it? (Photo Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures)Meanwhile the magic mirror goes missing and everyone knows that if Freya gets her hands on it thats the end of life as we know it or something. Eric is the best tracker in Snow Whites kingdom where hes now living in hiding so hes called in to find the mirror. He gets help mostly of a comical nature from dwarf brothers Nion (Nick Frost) and Gryff (Rob Brydon). Along the way they pick up two more dwarves Mrs. Bromwyn (Sheridan Smith) and Doreena (Alexandra Roach). The back-and-forth banter from these four is a highlight.Help also arrives from an unexpected source - well not really unexpected but Ill play along with the surprise. The ultimate Big Bad is maybe supposed to be surprising too though you usually dont throw a bunch of big names into the opening credits without getting your moneys worth from them.Its all too much without ever turning into much at all. Were girding for a fight we know this. The rest is nice-looking preparation.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestCedric Nicolas-Troyan nominated for an Oscar for visual effects in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" takes over as director his first feature in that capacity. He has trouble making the disjointed pieces of Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazins script fit together neatly though that would have been a tough job even for a seasoned veteran. But like the first film the visuals are gorgeous and the costumes extravagant.As befits the modern fairy tale there isnt so much a happily ever after as there is the promise of another sequel. Or prequel. Or whatever they come up with to take the Snow White concept to the bank one ... more ... time.

The Huntsman Winters War stars Charlize Theron Chris Hemsworth Jessica Chastain and Emily Blunt. VPCEmily Blunt and Charlize Theron are powerful sisters in The Huntsman Winters War.(Photo Giles Keyte)Around the time Emily Blunt is riding a chubby polar tiger/bear one can imagine Kristen Stewart being glad shes sitting out The Huntsman The Winters War.The fantasy adventure (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) acts as both prequel and sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman as it expands the faux fairy-tale world by upping the ridiculousness adding some A-listers and jacking plot points from Frozen. Its a dunderheaded follow-up for sure but its at least buoyed by Chris Hemsworths charisma and the few times where Winters War embraces complete camp.The title is a misnomer for those expecting lots of big-time battlefield action -- instead director Cedric Nicolas-Troyans effort could have been called The Huntsman Going Snowhere since Snow White is pretty much AWOL (except for one scene where someone probably an extra is seen going mad facing the infamous magic mirror).USA TODAYHuntsman Winters War A look at the (stunning) costumesThis film instead is anchored on Freya (Blunt) the relatively nice sister of evil Queen Ravenna (a returning Charlize Theron). She has her heart broken the tragic incident unlocks some crazy ice powers and she leaves in a huff to build an ice kingdom up north. (The only thing missing? A rousing kid-friendly musical number. But well let it go for now.)To take over various lands -- for no apparent reason other than being constantly irked -- Freya recruits and trains an army of huntsmen including young warrior lovebirds Eric (Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain). But because romance doesnt fly in this icy wonderland Freya deceives and separates them. Seven years later after Eric has helped Snow get her kingdom and kill Ravenna (see the first movie) he and Sara meet again and with the help of some quippy dwarves try to keep Freya from getting the magic mirror and ruling everything.Eric (Chris Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain) rekindle a romance in The Huntsman Winters War. (Photo Giles Keyte)The plot is a jumble that boasts more goblins and fairies than incidents of decent character motivation but at least it looks cool Nicolas-Troyan who didnt direct the first movie but snagged an Oscar nod for its visual effects brings back the neato liquid metal of the mirror and adds in Freyas cold crib (which resembles something out of a Flash Gordon movie) and ever-changing wardrobe.Its really hard to buy Blunt in bad-girl mode and Chastain is mostly one-dimensionally stoic as the only woman who has found tight black leather pants in this magical landscape. She does have sizzle with Hemsworth and while its a change of pace from the manly Thor he finds some success playing Eric with a certain Indiana Jones-y ""This is the worst plan ever"" vibe.USA TODAYJessica Chastain joins Huntsman goes to WarTheron for as much as she stars in the marketing materials is hardly in the movie -- not that surprising since Ravenna was dead when the last film ended. Thanks to some wizardry however she comes back and Theron hams it up mightily. Winters War doesnt lean into its inherent kitschiness nearly enough yet at least she is a riot as a screaming-mad villainess.Is she the fairest of them all? Sorry but no ones worthy of that title in this fantastical farce. 14 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1SvxQbb",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/04/21/review-the-huntsman-winters-war-movie/83267158/,200,thehuntsmanwinter'swar22,thehuntsmanwinter'swar,usatoday

(Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures via AP) Photo Giles Keyte Associated Press The Huntsman Winters War completely misses the mark 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""The Huntsman Winters War"" is a resoundingly unlovable movie that almost resists being watched. It is difficult to imagine anyone liking it or anyone ever watching it more than once. Yet it might take two viewings or more to figure out precisely what went wrong here because many of its elements are not bad at all. The movie has characters with strong drives and needs in collision with other characters of equal strength and interest and theyre played by people who have done great work elsewhere and who are just fine here Chris Hemsworth Jessica Chastain Emily Blunt Charlize Theron. ... But nothing they do -- no acting moments they have -- can compensate for the movies overall atmosphere of exhaustion and futility. This is not just a film that didnt need to be made but one that feels as if no one wanted to make it as if no one really believed in it. They just hoped you would. Perhaps the fault is with the director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan a visual effects specialist who until now has never made a feature film. Perhaps a more seasoned director wouldnt have settled for such a sluggish edit or for sound effects in the sword fights that are so obviously overlaid and unvarying that they become almost funny Clang clang grunt. Clang clang grunt. ... Perhaps another director wouldnt have kept cutting to close-ups of Hemsworths smile as the definition of all that is warm and winning in the world. The strange thing is the problem doesnt seem to be the script. Or rather the problem doesnt seem to be the execution of the script which has some good ideas. Rather the problem may be the existence of the script in that this is something the world didnt need didnt ask for and really doesnt want -- a sequel to a movie that was pretty bad the first time around ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" Actually its not exactly a sequel but its not exactly a prequel either. It begins before ""Snow White"" begins but it ends years after ""Snow White"" ends. There may be some illogic in this if we study the trajectory of the Huntsman played by Hemsworth who is in both movies. But at least its unusual. Theron reprises her role as the wicked queen Ravenna who didnt fare well in the last installment. We meet her this time just as evil but before the whole Snow White unpleasantness. She has a mild and gentle sister Freya (Blunt) whose horrible disappointment in love scars and transforms her into becoming a wicked queen in her own right ruling over another land. Actually she is an ice queen with a capacity to freeze anything with a wave of her hand. I know what youre thinking. Youre either thinking ""Who cares?"" or you anticipated thinking ""Who cares?"" and skipped the last paragraph. Yet Blunt does something with the role. She turns Freya into a study in psychological damage. She outlaws the emotion of love and commits acts of cruelty while telling herself that shes helping people. She is like a dangerously neurotic parent who insists on affection and approval from her own victims and she is almost frightening because her self-delusion is unbreakable. In another context in another story in another movie in another artistic universe this would be an interesting character. So would Sara the warrior played by Chastain in her ongoing series of portraits in fierceness. Sara grows up with the Huntsman and is in love with the Huntsman but she finds herself tormented by inner conflict. Being a woman of action she can express this only in action and again this is almost interesting. That is Chastain is interesting and the character is interesting but only as something to think about outside the movie. Within the movie everything and everybody is just something to be endured. Of course we know how it all must end. With action movies as with romantic comedies we always know where things are heading. The trick is in making it a pleasure to get there that there should not only be surprises but surprises that delight or excite and fascinate. But theres nothing like that here. Everyone here is punching a clock or punching a blue screen and everyones glad when its over. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. Email mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Share Tweet ""You may be surprised by how things turn out"" says one superpowered impeccably costumed fairy-tale queen to another during the opening section of The Huntsman Winters War. In strict plot terms her suggestion does not come to pass. But logistically speaking shes on to something. It turns out for example that the negligible 2012 fantasy film Snow White And The Huntsman was considered popular enough to forge a cinematic universe and to such an extent that Universal Pictures deemed it prudent to move forward without the participation of Snow White (Kristen Stewart). Further anyone who enters into Winters War expecting either a sequel or a prequel may be surprised by how it turns out to be both.The decision to set the first 20 or so minutes of Winters War before the momentous yet largely forgotten events of the first film then jump ahead years later to complete the story seems like an ungainly compromise. Yet the way the movie sweeps the corners on the stories of Eric (Chris Hemsworth) and Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) does deepen its imaginary world--or at least makes that world a more entertaining place to explore.In its opening moments the new movie introduces Freya (Emily Blunt) sister of Ravenna whose supernatural powers are awakened by a personal tragedy; shes basically an angrier Elsa from Frozen. Once she powers up Freya forms a new kingdom and raises an army by capturing the children of her (somewhat inexplicable) enemies and raising them into well-trained Huntsmen warriors with little discernible purpose. Eric is one such Huntsman and grows close to another Sara (Jessica Chastain). Sensing their bond Freya separates the two. Years later following the events of Snow White a forest-wandering Eric is recruited to destroy Ravennas magic mirror which has been cast as a heavier more unwieldy version of the One Ring. To destroy it requires the strength of a hero as well as a professional furniture mover.Thats the basic outline of a movie thats busy with deaths resurrections side-switching and unconvincing fake-outs. Its all pretty silly but it compensates for a lack of emotional weight with star power. The movies formidable and female-heavy cast is made up of some of the most talented Hollywood actress yet to a succumb to a comic book movie. Perhaps they are hoping to log their big-budget fantasy time quickly painlessly and in the company of other talented performers; whatever the reason might be that a goofy Snow White follow-up should retain Theron and also recruit both Blunt and Chastain their mere presence helps immeasurably. This is especially true for the fantasy-of-remarriage material between a spirited Chastain and a knocked-around Hemsworth still sporting a mumbly Scottish accent and still great at taking imaginary punches. (He also trades barbs with a smaller but more engaging group of dwarves including the first films Nick Frost.) Their physical sparring relationship configures a more modern fairy-tale romance close to what the previous Snow White movie seemed to be stumbling around in search of. Really Winters War is superior to its predecessor in almost every way with better pacing funnier dwarves a less overcast tone and vastly more goblins.The movie is enjoyable enough then to feel like both a course correction and a missed opportunity. Snow White And The Huntsman was hampered by a first-time feature director with experience in effects-heavy commercials. Naturally when given the opportunity to replace him the producers have simply hired the visual effects supervisor of Snow White And The Huntsman Cedric Nicolas-Troyan another first-time director who often shoots fantastical sights in a square borderline mundane style. When Eric and Sara are given the chance to fight their way through two groups of soldiers to reunite Nicolas-Troyan doesnt bother figuring out an inventive way of putting both of their fight scenes into the frame together. He just cuts back and forth with a listless paucity of imagination. Like too many blockbuster-level directors he settles for directing effects-heavy traffic. The filmmakers may have built in an excuse for dumbing down their technique Winters War is in the end more fairy tale than swashbuckler even though it works better as the latter. (Neither Huntsman movie is as sprightly a fairy tale as Tarsem Singhs underappreciated Snow White picture Mirror Mirror.) The real auteur here is costume designer Colleen Atwood allowed to run wild with liquid flowing dresses webbed ice gowns and stylish leather battle gear. Though its filled with CG effects enough of Winters War feels enough like an old-fashioned production--stars costumes sets--to forgive cornball narration thematically wrought games of chess and lame intimations of further sequels. Its inarguably a waste of time; both its stars and its audience probably deserve better. But sometimes wasting time can be fun in the right company.

EntertainmentMovies Huntsman Winters War -- another sequel with no reason to exist Originally published April 21 2016 at 1200 am Updated April 22 2016 at 1043 am Emily Blunt left stars as Queen Freya and Charlize Theron as Queen Ravenna in ""The Huntsman Winters War."" (Credit Giles Keyte) ""The Huntsman Winters War"" Even Charlize Therons deliciously evil Queen Ravenna and the hunky Chris Hemsworth cant save this ""Snow White"" sequel. 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic If you buy a ticket to ""The Huntsman Winters War"" in the hopes of seeing Charlize Therons deliciously evil Queen Ravenna again (previously spotted devouring virgins and dead birds in 2012s ""Snow White and the Huntsman"") make sure you get a comfortable seat. After a few brief opening scenes involving a chess-related murder() and some tiresome dialogue with her sister Freya (Emily Blunt) Therons Ravenna flounces out of the movie not to return until its final act more than an hour later. Watching this films endless middle section youll wish you could join her. Directed by first-timer Cedric Nicolas-Troyan ""The Huntsman"" is a flabby mess -- yet another sequel with no reason to exist. Actually its both prequel and sequel with a fast-forwarded chunk of time in the middle in which Kristen Stewart the Snow White of the original resides unseen. At its center are two evil queens with the mournful and much-less-fun-than-her-sister Freya getting most of the screen time. (Nicolas-Troyan heroically proves that its possible to get a dull performance from Blunt who spends the movie looking sad confused and as if shed like to find the exit door Theron sashayed through.) Movie Review 1/2   The Huntsman Winters War with Chris Hemsworth Charlize Theron Emily Blunt Jessica Chastain Nick Frost Rob Brydon Sam Claflin. Directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan from a screenplay by Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazin. 114 minutes. Rated PG-13 for fantasy action violence and some sensuality. Several theaters. Opposite the wicked monarchs are two warriors played by Chris Hemsworth grinningly reprising his I-know-Im-cute role from the original and Jessica Chastain who has virtually nothing to do except fling weapons about and act cranky. This couple who are supposedly in love -- though its hard to tell -- is terribly dull. Also on hand are four dwarves apparently because nobody wanted to spend the budget to hire seven.

Once Ravenna finally shows up again the movie perks up a bit thanks to Colleen Atwoods dazzling costumes (particularly a shining high-collared cape that cleverly turns into a flock of golden birds and which I suspect might be useful in my wardrobe) and Therons gloriously biting way of making bad dialogue sound like Shakespeare. (Sample ""Love doesnt save your life. I should know. Ive been dead before."" Seriously she sells it.) The movie ends with a veiled threat of another sequel something about how ""no fairy tale truly ends"" which is really just cruel taunting at this point. Just give Ravenna her own movie already -- or hand over that cape and well say no more. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

Oscar-winning costume designer Colleen Atwood tells EW all about the drop-dead looks she created for the film. (Giles Keyte) C+ The Huntsman Winters War Genre Fantasy; Starring Chris Hemsworth Jessica Chastain Emily Blunt Charlize Theron; Release Date 04/22/2016; Runtime (in minutes) 123; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted April 20 2016 -- 547 PM EDT See also See the new trailer for The Huntsman Winters War WATCH The Huntsman Winters War exclusive clip At Oscar time every year below-the-line departments like make-up costumes and production design tend to get lumped together in whats called ""the technical categories"".  They tend to be underappreciated but they shouldnt be. Each can be critically important in casting a spell over the audience. But they cant do all of the work. Which is more or less what theyre asked to do in the sumptuous-but-ultimately-hollow fairy tale campfest The Huntsman Winters War. Technically a prequel to 2012s also-lavishly flimsy box-office hit Snow White and the Huntsman the film looks absolutely stunning (especially Colleen Atwoods lusciously medieval costumes which feel like Game of Thrones by way of Christian Dior).  But theres nothing dramatically interesting or original beneath all of the spectacle. Its the movie equivalent of a cake thats all frosting. With the absence of Kristen Stewarts Snow White this time around what were left with is a quartet of scenery-chewing performances that are broad enough to be Kabuki theater. Charlize Theron who makes Maleficent look like a wallflower oozes insidious venom as the jealous bitch queen Ravenna. Emily Blunt matches her Freudian frostiness icicle-for-icicle as her scorned sister and rival Freya. And Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain get to brawl clinch and try on ill-fitting Scottish accents as the love-struck huntsman and huntress out to prove that love leather chaps and presumably haggis conquer all. The story takes place years before the Snow White saga with Therons wicked Ravenna betraying her sister thereby unleashing Freyas Snowmiser ability to transform everything she touches to ice including her own heart. Exiled to a snowy kingdom Freya kidnaps and trains an army of warrior children - two of whom grow up to become Hemsworths Eric and Chastains Sara. Their love for one another so offends Freya that she separates them. (If shes unlucky in love everyone else will be too.) But years later they reunite while looking for the fables enchanted mirror. Erics odyssey is only slightly more interesting thanks to a pair of diminutive comic-relief dwarves (Rob Brydon and Nick Frost). Winters War was directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan the man behind Snow White and the Huntsmans Oscar-nominated special effects. And even if you didnt know that you could have guessed it. Because thats exactly how he approaches the movie doubling down on style over substance. (Did I mention the movie looks spectacular?) Too bad the story which is commercially savvy enough to strip Disneys Frozen for parts is such a giant shrug of the shoulders. Theres a certain place on every movie lovers menu for big-budget eye-candy costume-a-paloozas - films that are all about over-the-top divas in dazzlingly ornate frocks going cheekbone-to-cheekbone as broadly as the sirens of the silent era. But there also needs to be more to them than just technical-category magic. It needs to touch your heart not just your retinas. There needs to be urgency shape and emotional investment. In a word a script. Otherwise its just a two-hour Vogue fashion shoot highlighted by Emily Blunt riding bareback on a polar bear.

Universal Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Careful what you wish for. When it was announced that Jessica Chastain and Emily Blunt would be joining Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth for the follow-up to 2012s humdrum action-fairytale Snow White and the Huntsman many filmgoers myself included got unduly excited. The original film while a hit had not been memorable; its main claim to fame was probably the public discovery of an affair between star Kristen Stewart and very married director Rupert Sanders. The second one sans Stewart or Sanders and featuring an entirely new story seemed to presage a new beginning. And the idea of three of our finest actresses -- performers who can truly go broad like the finest onscreen divas -- hissing and bellowing and making those wavy-magic-hand-gesture thingies at each other while decked out in elaborate medieval fantasy regalia...well it seemed like it might be something special. Campy perhaps but special. Something you might want to yell ""YAASS QUEEN"" at.Funny story It appears that the makers of The Huntsman Winters War had the same idea because the film absolutely delivers on the scenery-chewing front. And yet the movie is still hollow and joyless.Film Details The Huntsman Winters War RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time123 min. More Info Trailer EXPAND Giles Keyte The story is both prequel and sequel. It begins years before the events of the first film opening on the beautiful Ravenna (Theron) seducing and killing her way to the throne of a new kingdom. Her sister Freya (Blunt) however isnt quite as ruthless; at the coronation Ravenna sees her making doe eyes at a handsome young vassal. Soon enough the new queen engineers a harrowing heartbreak for her sister. This both puts Freya in touch with her secret power -- she can instantly transform the people and things around her into ice -- and turns her against the very idea of love. She seizes a kingdom in the north and begins raising an army of stolen children. Among them are young warriors Eric and Sarah who will grow up to be Hemsworth and Chastain. Very illegally in love the two fall afoul of Freya and lets just say it doesnt end well for them.At this point the film actually jumps forward seven years to a period following the events of Snow White and the Huntsman -- a misstep since Im not sure anyone actually remembers what happened in that movie. Ravenna has allegedly been vanquished and killed. (Yeah right.) Eric is enlisted by Snow White now the queen to find Ravennas magic mirror which possesses an evil seductive power -- and which has gone mysteriously missing. (We dont actually see Snow White mind. Stewarts not in the film.) He sets off on his quest accompanied by a small coterie of dwarves (dont ask). Meanwhile Freya also has her sights set on her sisters mirror and shes raising an army to invade the kingdom of Snow White. Anyway its like Frozen meets Tolkien meets Brian De Palmas Sisters but not nearly as good as that sounds. EXPAND Giles Keyte Winters War was directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan who worked on the special effects for the first film. He has a facility with the storybook-like visuals and a nice handle on the actors. Even pitching their performances at an absurdly high level the cast mostly fare well. Hemsworth and Chastains physicality makes up for their unfortunate pseudo-Scottish accents. Theron sneers and sniffs and slithers with abandon. Blunt is brittle vulnerable angry -- and when she breaks it can be glorious. The costumes are ornate imaginative and ravishing and the uncommonly beautiful cast look great in them.So whats the problem? Nothing seems to have any weight or consequence. Stewarts absence shouldnt be a problem; shes an entirely different type of performer and would be totally out of place in this heated histrionic atmosphere. But I missed her or at least the idea of her. We keep hearing of Snow Whites kingdom her armies and whats going on with her -- but we never really see any of it which really becomes a problem in the climax which is all about saving that kingdom. EXPAND Giles Keyte Meanwhile Freyas backstory about how she became an ice queen and learned to despise love never has much bearing on the actual tale. In Frozen Queen Elsas inability to control her powers led to her exiling herself to an ice palace of solitude and regret; the movie turned on her sisters belief in her fundamental goodness. Here Freyas heartbreak is dropped in at the beginning and the end; in between shes mostly just a standard-issue villain with unclear aims.Theres nothing in Huntsman to hold its pieces together. Everybodys acting up a storm but nobody expresses any urgency or aspiration or desire -- and whats worse none of those great actors have been given any memorable lines. Its a quest narrative where nobody cares about the quest. Its a war movie where nobody cares about the war. Its a fantasy where nobody cares about magic. And sadly the more they all snarl and shake and shout the more we notice that theres very little for anyone to get worked up about.Huntsman Winters WarDirected by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan Universal Pictures Opens April 22 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Bilge Ebiri Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Another fractured fairy tale with Chris Hemsworth taking up arms. Director Cedric Nicholas-Troyan. (154). PG-13 Strong language violence sexual situations. Area theaters. Two royal and royally feuding sisters one with the power to turn the world to ice? After ""Frozen"" the familiar ""The Huntsman Winters War"" feels like twice upon a time. It steals from even better sagas too. There are rowdy dwarves and a cursed object right out of ""The Lord of the Rings."" Theres a pale wintry queen and a castle full of frozen statues straight from ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe."" This picture even nicks that last movies Aslan dragging in Liam Neeson to give the patient narration. KRISTEN STEWART RUPERT SANDERS OUT OF SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN UPCOMING PREQUEL The film borrows plenty but it brings nothing new. The sequel doesnt even bring back Kristen Stewart the star of ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" (and the survivor of a gossipy romantic drama with that first films director off screen). The character is on hand sure but only mentioned a couple of times and seen once from the back. Did they think audiences wouldnt notice the franchises star magically disappeared? Wicked sisters Freya (Emily Blunt) and Queen Ravenna (Charlize Theron) channel a little Frozen for The Huntsman Winters War. (Photo Credit Giles Keyte) This awkward installment directed by Cedric Nicholas-Troyan is both a prequel and a sequel. First it shows us the early unhappy life of the first films wicked queen Ravenna and her cold sister Freya. Then it splits them up and sends the icy Freya away. KRISTEN STEWART NOT EXPECTED TO RETURN FOR SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN 2 Finally it skips years ahead for a new adventure that reintroduces the Huntsman from the first movie but gives him a tragic love and a new adventure - find the missing magic mirror from the first film and destroy it. Chris Hemsworth is probably the fairest of them all in the sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman (Credit Giles Keyte) Like its predecessor ""The Huntsman Winters War"" piles on more crazy costumes and elaborate dos than Fashion Week. And yes with her sterling silver dresses and Emmylou Harris hair Emily Blunts Freya is particularly fetching. She gives the film its (mostly) icy heart. But the movies special effects arent just unconvincing theyre silly. No matter how much ice Freya creates it still looks like Lucite. And why is that chess set suddenly dripping blood or Ravenna oozing tar? Certainly every role is well cast. Chris Hemsworth remains an absurdly perfect hunk and Charlize Theron is the most beautiful of them all as Ravenna. Blunt provides some complex conflicts and Jessica Chastain is surprisingly kick-butt as Hemsworths ex-love and comrade-in-arms. The arrow is pointed up on new addition Sara played by Jessica Chastain. (Credit Giles Keyte) Plus with all those strong actresses onboard this is not the standard please-rescue-me fairy tale. These princesses rule in every way. Still weve seen this all before. ""Maleficent"" ""Mirror Mirror"" ""Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters"" ""Red Riding Hood"" - its hard to keep track of how many edgy new versions of fairy tales weve been given lately. This isnt even the worst of the bunch. But I know if the trend stopped now I could live happily ever after.

Played by Kristen Stewart in the 2012 franchise originator ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" the apple enthusiast doesnt even turn up in flashback (or forward); we merely hear about how things are going well in her happy kingdom. Seems she was just too boring to bother about. Instead this film concentrates on the blossoming of the butch Huntsman himself (a returning Chris Hemsworth) necessitating a lot of backstory/prologue nudged along by a portentously rich voice over telling us that this story ""came long before the Happy Ever After."" Its also a tale of two sisters thus taking an early stab at that live-action remake of ""Frozen."" See Video Emily Blunt Gets Dangerous in New Huntsman Winters War Trailer Charlize Theron once again plays the evil Queen Ravenna -- we know shes evil because she plays chess in an off-the-shoulder gown split to the thigh. She doesnt like the idea of her happy sister Freya (Emily Blunt) falling in love and having a child so she cruelly scuppers that relationship; heartbroken Freya turns all Ice Queen and retreats to her own kingdom far to the north. So far north is it in fact that people there are forced to do a Scottish accent. (Ill let Jessica Chastain have the benefit of that doubt anyway.) For it is in this freezing realm that Chastain as Sara and Hemsworths Eric are taken as child soldiers and trained to join Freyas elite squad of Huntsmen. Also Read David Fincher Charlize Therons Mindhunter Goes to Netflix Freya ice queen that she is with her chain-mail dress grief-white hair and wolf-like pale eyes has forbidden all love in her kingdom. Bad news for hormonally aroused lead warriors Eric and Sara whose illicit passions in what looks like the lands only hot tub enrage Queen Freya. She builds an ice wall between them to freeze them asunder. Or something. Cramming in so much setup and new fairy tale ""origin"" isnt easy and to their credit writers Evan Spiliotopoulos (the Brett Ratner ""Hercules"") and Craig Mazin (the second and third ""Hangover"" entries) achieve it with economy leaving the effects and design teams to splash the cash with handsome palaces killer dresses and raging goblins. The film eventually settles into a quest movie (complete with a wobbly rope-bridge scene) as Hemsworths Eric joins up with some comedy sidekick dwarves -- yes there be dwarves -- played by British comedians Rob Brydon (""The Trip"") and Nick Frost. Theyre off to find Ravennas Magic Mirror (its more a cross between the Rank gong and the Wimbledon ladies tennis trophy if you ask me) which has been sent away from her kingdom so that no one should look into its evil powers. Turns out it was hijacked and stolen en route to a place called the Sanctuary. (Was it going for a spa weekend?) See Photos Chris Hemsworth Nerds Out in New Ghostbusters Photos There are more fairy tale realms to cross a sylvan glade with red squirrels and hedgehogs with flowers on their spikes as well as goblin lairs and yes more ice with just enough time for Emily Blunt to ride in on a Polar Bear. ""The Huntsman Winters War"" is all fairly silly but unfortunately the filmmakers dont quite realize it -- along with banning love decent gags seem to have been outlawed too. Still there are a lot of fights involving sticks and axes and good old bows and arrows and the climax brings about a hefty dollop of star power and CGI magic as the themes of love betrayal sisters and dwarves slip and slide over the slushy floor of the Ice Palace. It is here that debut director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan flexes his Oscar-nominated (for ""Snow White and the Huntsman"") visual effects credentials. Hemsworth carries off Eric with his customary beefy swagger even employing a bit of compatriot Mel Gibsons ""Braveheart"" accent. Chastain is clearly not at her most comfortable in this nonsense yet she hurls herself into the ninja archery with gusto game face squarely set to on. Perhaps because shes too busy concentrating on her swordplay and Scottish-ish accent theres no real spark between Chastain and Hemsworth reducing this to a competent-enough fantasy fairy tale that tries to appeal to a young ""Game of Thrones"" crowd alongside fans of the Disney cartoon universe and their current live-action reboots. It mostly succeeds. And if all else fails at least its a movie smart enough to know that frankly you cant beat Charlize Theron covered in gold shooting lethal spiky tentacles out of her midriff.

Tough youve got one. Mirror mirror on the wall whats the fairest sequel of them all? Not this follow-up to Snow White and the Huntsman which starred Kristen Stewart as Snow White and Charlize Theron as her hot evil stepmother. Winters War is hammily entertaining but at points feels like a Russian oligarch has thrown a Game of Thrones party and bunged his favourite Hollywood actors a few million quid each to come in fancy dress. Kristen Stewart is gone. So this time the story - it gets pretty messy - begins as a prequel with the queens heartbroken sister (Emily Blunt) fleeing to a frozen wasteland. Curdled by grief she transforms into the Ice Queen kidnapping children to grow an army of heartless killers. The one rule in her kingdom is that nobody can fall in love. But two of her fighters (Jessica Chastain and Chris Hemsworth back as the Huntsman) cant help it. Blunt outclasses everyone cold as steel and creepily unhinged. Chastain does a decent Katniss. But chirpy-chappy Chris Hemsworth looks like hes in a different movie. And like the original we get the ritual humiliation of British actors digitally shrunken to dwarf-size (Nick Frost Rob Brydon). All told Winters War is not the fairest sequel but its not so terrible that it deserves to be taken out to the forest and finished off.

TWITTER 4/22/2016 Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron are back for the follow-up to 2012s Snow White and the Huntsman joined by Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain but sans Kristen Stewart. In many respects The Huntsman Winters War producer Joe Roths follow-up to 2012s Snow White and the Huntsman is a slicker more accessible possibly more commercial film than its predecessor. And yet theres something ineffably dispiriting about it. Derided before anyone saw a still as the sequel-prequel-whatever that nobody really wanted its passably entertaining and like the last one breathtakingly crafted especially Colleen Atwoods microscopically detailed costumes. But it still carries the sulfuric whiff of a changeling creature a serviceable vehicle bolted together from remnants if you can say that of an expensive package that includes Chris Hemsworth Charlize Theron Emily Blunt and Jessica Chastain in its cast. Although literally brighter and more sunlit than Snow White the absence of key talents casts shadows over its surface. Snow Whites original director Rupert Sanders currently filming Ghost in the Shell was replaced by writer-director Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead). Creative differences saw off the latter and so the director credit now goes to Cedric Nicolas-Troyan (he was the VFX supervisor on Snow White and the Huntsman and second-unit director on Maleficent). Obviously the most palpable absence is that of Kristen Stewarts Snow White gone probably not because of her much-hyped extramarital affair with Sanders but because the actor would have been perhaps too expensive for this installment according to some sources. Its not hard to figure out how Universal and Roth did the math to work out they didnt need Stewart especially now that Hemsworth barely a blip on the tracking data in 2012 is such a huge deal on the back of his work in the Marvel universe. Whichever way you add it up its not just a significant loss but an ironic one Isnt part of the appeal of fairy tale rejigs like Snow White and the Huntsman Maleficent Into the Woods the TV series Once Upon a Time and going back to a cornerstone work Angela Carters short stories in The Blood Chamber that they offer a feminist or at least female-centric twist on traditional (and often traditionally misogynistic) material? So in 2016 after all the debates about disparate pay the Bechdel test the paucity of female filmmakers and female lead characters in mainstream filmmaking AskHerMore and all the rest isnt it kind of depressing that one of the few big-budget franchises of the last five years to feature a woman protagonist has literally written her out of her own eponymous story in order to make some guy the star of the show? Its as if Lionsgate and Co. had decided to get rid of Katniss after the first The Hunger Games movie in order to focus on Liam Hemsworths Gale instead because Jennifer Lawrence was too expensive. The excision must have not sat right with someone on the team because as if to ""right"" the gender imbalance and make up for the absence of Snow White herself The Huntsman Winters War borrows from the Disney/Once Upon a Time playbook of mix-and-match storytelling to introduce a character from a completely different fairy tale the Ice Queen that iconic figure from Frozen... sorry Hans Christian Andersen. It turns out that Ravenna the evil queen played by Theron in Snow White had a sister named Freya (Emily Blunt) as well as a brother whose existence wasnt mentioned in the first film. In the extended prequel portion of the story we learn how originally gentle Freya along for the ride while Ravenna rehearsed her black widow routine on previous kings got her magic frosty freak on after her nobleman lover (Robert Wilfort) seemingly burnt their infant daughter alive in order to get out of marrying her. Having developed post-traumatic ice-generating power Freya sets herself up in a kingdom in the north determined to use her army of abducted child soldiers to wipe out romantic love everywhere. Two of her early conscripts are Scots-accented Eric (Conrad Khan later Hemsworth) and Sara (Niamh Walter who like Khan to Hemsworth is exceptionally well cast or made up to look like someone who would grow up to be Jessica Chastain). Despite the brutal conditions of Freyas army called the Huntsmen the two fall in love. However when their passion for one another is discovered Freya separates them with a wall of enchanted ice through which Eric sees Sara being killed by their friend and fellow soldier Tull (Sope Dirisu) -- hence Erics identification of himself as a widower in the first film. Seven years pass according to the subtitles and by implication in that time all the events of the previous movie happen. In The Huntsmans present Snow White (only her back is seen) now married to William (a briefly returning Sam Claflin) is disturbed by the malign influence of Ravennas magic golden mirror around the castle. It falls into the hands of CGI goblins (pleasingly gorilla-like) and Eric is dispatched to retrieve and destroy it. Assisting him in this endeavor will be Nion (Nick Frost) one of the seven-to-eight dwarves met in the earlier installment and Gryff (Rob Brydon) who supposedly are brothers even though they have completely different regional British accents. Gender parity is achieved when Eric meets someone from his past and the troupe is joined by Mrs. Bromwyn (Sheridan Smith) and Doreena (Alexandra Roach) two female dwarves whose snappy caustic banter with Nion and Gryff provides credibly entertaining comic relief thanks especially to Smith and Brydons piquant timing and easy chemistry with each other. They at least look like theyre having a bit of a laugh but that doesnt feel like its the case for the actors playing the non-dwarf characters. Hemsworth and Chastain -- who incidentally have absolutely zero chemistry as a couple -- both seem defeated and miserable and dont even get to have the fun Theron and Blunt enjoy goggling their eyes while looking villainous at various points throughout. Plus the latter two get to model some of the very best creations to come out of Colleen Atwoods atelier proper exhibition-worthy works of art that are the stuff of costume fans wildest dreams. Like her work for the many Tim Burton films she has costumed for as well as the film musicals for Rob Marshall (Chicago Nine Into the Woods) these gowns are insanely detailed and 4K-ready down to the tiniest sequin and fake headdress feather set off beautifully by Luca Vannellas fittingly intricate make-up and hair designs (which will in themselves launch a thousand how-to YouTube clips on braidwork). When the knives are drawn at the end and CGI lets rip with the climactic destruction its like a cross between Kinji Fukasakus Battle Royale and RuPauls Drag Race. But surely something has gone very wrong with a film when viewers feels more invested in the costumes than the characters.

Spare a thought for Snow White So casually has she been written out of ""The Huntsman Winters War"" that even Queen Ravennas all-knowing mirror when called upon to name the fairest of them all omits her as a contender. Vague excuses are made for her absence from a film that awkwardly positions itself as both prequel and sequel to the Goth-lite derring-do of 2012s ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" though perhaps Snow skimmed Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazins perfunctory script and reasonably decided she couldnt be bothered. In her (and Kristen Stewarts) place a Katniss Everdeen-styled Jessica Chastain steps into the breach fighting for good alongside Chris Hemsworths eponymous hero -- this time against two wicked-queen combatants in Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt whose glittery sisterly feud would have made for an adequate spinoff vehicle on its own. Even their doubled-up diva-tude however cant ignite a rhythmically flat seemingly committee-helmed franchise outing that never decides on its dramatic center. ""There is another story -- one you have not yet seen"" a po-faced (and excessively employed) narrator informs viewers at the outset of ""The Huntsman Winters War."" Hes speaking somewhat optimistically it turns out since Spiliotopoulos and Mazins hastily cobbled-together mythos cribs liberally from existing fairy-tale lore with a not-inconsiderable side scoop of Disneys ubiquitous smash ""Frozen."" What the narrator doesnt tell us is precisely which story hes referring to At least two are jostling for space here each one stepping conspicuously around the events of the previous film though not maintaining complete continuity with it. (The intermediate backstory of Chastains virtuous warrior Sara for example appears to shift at least once in the course of the new pics screenplay alone.) ""The Huntsmans"" opening act chronologically preceding the timeline of ""Snow White"" by a couple of decades is dedicated to matters of queenly corruption reintroducing Therons vixenish Ravenna as she adds another royal scalp to her growing list of kills via a black magic-abetted chess match. She assumes power as her pure-hearted younger sister Freya (Blunt) looks on; professing to have no political or supernatural aspirations Freya instead dreams of courtly bliss with the young Duke (Colin Morgan) whose child she is to bear. When her plan is foiled in grisly fashion however her witchy powers -- chiefly a touch of frost markedly similar to Queen Elsas -- belatedly emerge. She defects to her own wintry Ice Queendom fostering her own army and banning human affection from her domain ""Love is nothing more than a fairy tale"" she hisses coolly oblivious to her own generic surroundings. Among the child soldiers she rears are prodigious huntspeople Eric and Sara who eventually take the strapping mutually amorous forms of Hemsworth and Chastain. Their romance prompts an arctic intervention from Freya; Eric is banished believing Sara dead. Its here that the tale of ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" slots in in its entirety necessitating an ungainly timeline leap of seven years War is indistinctly looming reigning monarch Snow White is indistinctly indisposed and the vanquished Ravennas missing mirror is now a vital quarry sought by Snow Whites and Freyas palaces alike. Huntsman Eric is enlisted to retrieve it for the former as faces from the past are resurrected along the way. Its a straightforward enough quest though the doom-laden stakes attached to it arent most urgently felt. As if anticipating auds lack of investment in Erics rather colorless presence much of his ostensible screen time is given over to the ""Lord of the Rings""-aping comic relief of sidekick dwarves Nion (Nick Frost returning from the previous film) and Gryff (Rob Brydon providing his patented Welsh-neurotic shtick). Its a dynamic that itself doesnt quite click until Sheridan Smith as assertive she-dwarf Bromwyn arrives on the scene. Regrettably dispensable to the larger narrative Smith (whose firecracker skills are already familiar to British TV auds) nonetheless proves the liveliest element in these dour proceedings. She certainly has more voluble chemistry with Hemsworth than a muted uncertainly Scots-accented Chastain -- formidable in medieval archery chic but otherwise (not unlike Stewart before her) finding little to grapple with in a character strictly shaped with the Hollywood screenwriters favored tough-cookie cutter. The silly-stern sportsmanship she brought to last years ""Crimson Peak"" would have been most welcome here. Also opting not to camp things up -- at least minimally so relative to Therons gilded bitchery is Blunt who maintains a shrill brittle sense of vulnerability in Freya even as she crosses over to the dark side though the film is considerably less interested in such character detailing than in giving her the glitziest brand of digital sorcery money can buy. No prizes for guessing that first-time feature helmer Cedric Nicolas-Troyan taking the reins from Rupert Sanders after Frank Darabonts abortive involvement was the Oscar-nominated visual effects supervisor on ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" Every frame here is expensively embellished with racing icicle formations arbitrary light beams or glistening synthetic sprites though he seems to have a less decisive hold on the films lurching to-and-fro storytelling. If then the pic seems to rush through the murkier adventures of the Huntsman to hasten a palace-set finale that may as well be subtitled ""Slay Queen"" its because the posher of its twin story arcs simply affords more fabulous spectacle -- in the effects department certainly but also in the form of Colleen Atwoods unapologetically over-designed royal gowns veritably cantilevered constructions of metal feathers and flesh. (Even Hemsworths fetching leather work garb has taken on a slightly impractical showiness; its barely a few rips away from fetish gear.) The sheer abundance of on-screen ornamentation isnt quite enough to make ""The Huntsman Winters War"" a beautiful film -- in contrast to the Indian-ink-and-gold contrasts of Greig Frasers work on its predecessor theres a milky glare to Phedon Papamichaels lensing that isnt quite seductive. Still its one that has been exhaustively designed by many hands -- which only further shows up its inelegant patchwork in the writing department. ""While fairy tales do come true none ever truly ends"" that same tireless narrator intones before the credits roll -- inevitably threatening a further contortion of this heavily stretched story material but inadvertently copping to the shapelessness of what weve just seen.

Not Tellin says May 2 2016 at 407 pm I cant agree until I actually see the movie. Even then I might(will probably) disagree with you. I believe youre upset because Kristen Stewart wont be in it. Me on the other hand am actually glad and hope they replace her as Snow White because she was never Snow White in the first place except for her dark hair. She tried to pull it off but she really didnt seem to know how to act as a lady of hat time period. I thought she did a very poor job as Snow White. If they decide to bring Snow White back in a third movie I hope they take their time and find someone who could actually play the part of Snow White. As a matter of fact I have a few suggestions they could try Jennifer Lawrence Emma Watson Dakota Fanning Hayden Panetierre Odeya Rush (Goosebumps movie) all of which might be able to take on this part I believe. Dakota Fanning might be able to as well but I fear with dark hair she might look sickly. They might be able to do something to help her with that though if shes able to play that part. Oh and Alexandra Daddario from what Ive always called California Dreaming because of the preview (LOL) but is really called San Andreas. All of these I believe from what Ive seen of their acting might be able to be Snow White but they should all have try outs first. Reply Corey says April 19 2016 at 911 pm I agree with much of the actual criticism here but this is an overwritten article if Ive ever seen one. Although the writing is obviously intelligent all the hyphenated adverbs adjectives and interjections distract from the arguments. I found myself counting the hyphens instead of following the writing. Reply Silvafox says April 12 2016 at 248 am Give us a break from the cut and paste powerful warrior women yet again inflicted into an action Movie. Its vaguely titled The Huntsman Winters War yet they have done everything to eliminate him as a lead character. The silly use of an accent to downplay his commanding booming voice as well he seems to spend most of his action scenes being beaten-up despite the reality that he could snap many of the combatants like a dry twig. Im not sure why the huntsman was actually in the movie. They may as well have had a cardboard cut-out figure on wheels and towed it around. Dont get me wrong Im not against powerful warrior women but please spare us from the social agendas and the cookie cutter scripts. Nor am I anti-special effects but please spend more time money and effort more on developing a semi-plausible storyline. Reply Simon says April 4 2016 at 444 pm Im sure this isnt the sequel Joe Roth had in mind when he cast Kristen Stewart as Snow White in the hopes that she would bring the Twilight audience. You cant blame Universal for cutting her loose after she had an affair in pubic with the SWATH director. Big budget films require a lead actress who can be trusted not a loose canon. Chastain and Blunt are reason enough to see this if you like the genre. Charlize was the best part of the original movie and she again looks strong. From the trailer I like the production design and costumes so despite this review I will happily plunk my money down. Reply Lulu says April 4 2016 at 718 pm Your comments shows your misogyny. If Kristen Stewart was a man no one would care. ""Loose cannon?"" Are you effing serious? Shes never been arrested or strung out on drugs. She was barely 22 year old young woman employee when some 44 year old married man her boss goes after her. How is she the loose cannon when the grown ass man should have known better thinking about his family? Which btw Universal had no problem signing him onto a project immediately while Stewart was taking a beating at the same time for what her did as well. Again men get away with everything. And for the record Kristen had Sony back her for an Oscar campaign for critically acclaimed performance in Still Alice. She won almost every critic award along with the French Oscar Cesar for her role in Clouds of Sils Maria. Got more critical acclaim for her performances in Camp X-ray Anesthesia and American Ultra. She highly anticipated movies coming out this year from Oscar winning directors Woody Allen and Ang Lee Certain Women Equals and Personal Shopper. SHE DOESNT NEED THE HUNTSMAN. This prequel and not a sequel because Snow White Id not involved and will bust. There is no interest and the critics are tearing it to shreds. Chri Hemsworth couldnt carry this movie on his own if he tried and the title is about his character. If Universal wants to continue this franchise they need Kristen Stewar to return. Im not seeing it. Reply Amy says April 9 2016 at 1115 pm Kristen Stewart smokes weed. Thats it. Like many other entertainers. That doesnt mean shes ""strung out"" on drugs. Give it a rest. me says April 5 2016 at 246 am Shes never been strung out on drugs? Ahem. OK. And dont be naive if the movie had made a bazillion dollars they wouldnt care what the star did. me says April 4 2016 at 233 pm Not to be gross but perfectly serious seeing a picture of Hemsworth with the word ""-cum"" right below it reminds me of the only type of movie I would see him in. Reply Simon says April 4 2016 at 802 pm LOL no. You are very misinformed. To start t the end Sony did not mount an Oscar campaign for her in Still Alice the complete focus was on Julianne Moore. Second Sony didnt hire her for Still Alice it was an indie production that they picked up distribution rights on. No studio has hired her since her cheating scandal was exposed. Studios have stockholders they have to answer to and doing some irresponsible like hiring an actress who put the future of two different franchises in jeopardy is not something they want to explain to stockholders. Kristen Stewart and Rupert Sanders are equally responsible for their tawdry affair. She was 22 not 12 and she knew right from wrong she just didnt care. She knew his wife and kids-you have to be really cold and calculating to cheat with a man when youve sat at his wifes dinner table. Who says Rupert Sanders got off unscathed? Universal also fired him and I dont think hes directed anything significant since. His wife divorced him and hes paying more than the 50% the state of CA requires in a no fault divorce state. Make of that what you will. All the critical acclaim in the world will never erase her cheating scandal. She was out of work for 18 months and has been taking small supporting roles in little indies for which she should be grateful. If she hadnt been in the business since she was a child and had so many contacts and all that Twilight money to spend on PR she probably never would have been able to come back. Reply Amy says April 9 2016 at 1112 pm Sony didnt hire anyone who we worked in Still Alice. What are you taking about? Complete utter nonsense. Lionsgate is a big studio. It distributed American Ultra. Kristen Stewart made a YOUTHFUL mistake. She messed up. We get it. Get a life. Seriously. Gabe says April 4 2016 at 223 pm live action frozen vibe anyone Reply Jane says April 16 2016 at 1231 pm lets be real about Kristen Stewart. She got very lucky getting cast in Twilight because shes a boring screen presence who sucks all the energy out of the scene. Shes maybe not a bad actress sometimes but shes not a movie star. She doesnt seem to want to be one anyway given how she acted during all the Twilight mayhem. She and Pattinson could have embraced their celebrity and run with it but they rejected it and seem to only want to do indie films from now on which is perfect - they are both pretty dull. In a few years when shes barely getting cast in Sundance movies because her name means nothing any more Stewart will regret being so difficult. She was the worst thing about the first Huntsman movie - but getting rid of her character definitely made no sense -- there is no reason for this ridiculous prequel/sequel. It is cynical film-making at its worst. Reply Jess Hurley says April 4 2016 at 1123 am Cant wait to see this thing. The last movie so called critics panned just made over 500 Million. Reply Benn says April 4 2016 at 1220 pm True but BVS is still deeply in rivers of red ink. 500 million is really great IF you did not invest 400 million in production and A/M Reply Benn says April 4 2016 at 814 am Can we declare Chris Hemsworths career dead yet? Reply me says April 4 2016 at 231 pm Well in order for it to be dead it would have had to be alive at some point wouldnt it? Reply EricJ says April 4 2016 at 1140 am No the Ghostbusters movie hasnt come out yet. Reply Benn says April 4 2016 at 1221 pm So we can declare it dead soon after that? Victor Field says April 4 2016 at 443 am Has a movie directed by an FX person EVER been any good? Reply Benn says April 4 2016 at 751 am I think you have a point. Although the closest one ever came was Douglas Trumbull depending on how you feel about Silent Running and Brainstorm. I would not call them great movies but ""good"" they flaws in those movies are caused by too much ambition so I forgive that and Trumbull is a truly brilliant guy. Other than that movies are littered with bad formerly effects guy - wanna be film directors. Reply EricJ says April 4 2016 at 1145 am James Cameron was FX techie on some 80s New World Roger Corman pictures before he did the first Terminator so.....no. ;) And in keeping with Jesss BvS joke lets just say that thinking there was still enough fairytale-fangirl momentum to do a Huntsman sequel even -without- Snow White to pull them in emphasizes WHY you should never green light sequels on Monday morning. Anything can happen on Tuesday. See All 21 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO Boss Talks True Detective Season 3 Deadwood Movie...
