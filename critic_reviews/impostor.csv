Scientist Spencer Olham (Sinise) has the dome-shielded alien-threatened Earth of 2079 sussed. Hes happily married to beautiful doctor Maya (Stowe) who administers to the poor outer-worlders while his own work has defence implications that could be world-saving. On the eve of an important meeting with a senior chancellor however hes whisked away for interrogation as a suspected alien replicant by a security major (DOnofrio). The design and execution of the movie is aimed at the MTV generation rather than the sci-fi aficionado but beneath the cinematographic murk and trickery Fleder quickly establishes a discernible whiff of Jacobean intrigue and Machiavellian politics. Sadly this evaporates as the subsequent escape-and-quest formula takes over. On the plus side the performances are solid with Sinises sobriety and lack of histrionics especially making him an anchoring and sympathetic presence.

Nearly every moment in this frenzied mess of a techno-wasteland chase thriller looks as if it was shot inside a cave of neon. The entire movie has the meaninglessly burnished sunglasses-at-midnight glow of an early-90s car commercial - a visual scheme guaranteed to leave the audience squinting between yawns. If you squint hard enough you may just catch a glimpse of Gary Sinise transforming his facial expression from earnest to stoic and then back again. He plays an elite military scientist in the paranoid war-torn earth of 2079 who suddenly finds himself accused of being an alien replicant with a suicide bomb implanted in his heart. (Talk about geek metaphors.) Is he or isnt he? And why should you care? Impostor was adapted from a 1953 short story by Philip K. Dick but it feels less like a cousin to Blade Runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the Escape From New York series.

""Imposter"" is a penny-pinched ""Blade Runner"" a stubbornly unexciting ride into the near future fronted by superb thesps in slumming mode. Built on a mood of paranoia and the theme of the uncertainty of appearances ""Impostor"" is based on a Philip K. Dicks short story and like so much of the sci-fi masters work this is fundamentally a detective thriller that strives to consider the realm of personal identity. Despite extremely resourceful uses of existing locales to depict a besieged America 75 years hence pics futuristic setting only partially convinces and helmer Gary Fleders indifferent handling gives the whole enterprise a generic feel that wont be enough to provide action fans the early January fix theyre desperate for right now. On Dimensions shelf since it was shot two years ago before Fleders similarly uninteresting contempo thriller ""Dont Say a Word"" production is hardly the kind of embarrassment that such dust-collectors usually portend. Indeed it reflects the upfront involvement of star Gary Sinise -- in one of his rare lead outings -- also serving as producer alongside Fleder. In the end alas the obvious interests of an actor of Sinises range and depth are subsumed to the blunt demands of a standardized chase movie. A brief prologue establishes weapons designer Spence Olham (Sinise) as the son of a father who died in the human races battle against theCentauri a highly developed and aggressive alien force intent on controlling Earth. Something like the invading beings in ""Independence Day"" but without the apparent instinct for overwhelming force the Centauri remain unseen throughout pic but their power is felt through their ability to kill people and replace them ""Body Snatcher""-like in an identical form only with a ticking nuclear bomb encased in the heart chamber. In the year 2079 Spence is happily married to Maya (Madeleine Stowe) a doctor at the Veterans Hospital in the center of an unnamed city that looks as if it was designed by an architect geek who read too many illustrated science fiction tomes. Spence and Mayas home is replete with voice-activated creature comforts while the outside world is under a giant shield to ward off invading Centauri. The wars latest weapon a Spence creation for which he has trepidation a la Robert Oppenheimer and his nuke is about to be presented to the ruling chancellor (Lindsay Crouse) and Spence and pal Nelson (Tony Shalhoub) are feeling the pressure. But things suddenly turn upside down in pics most startling scene as security chief Hathaway (Vincent DOnofrio) suddenly zaps and drugs Spence and arrests him. The charge Spence is Spence no more -- hes an alien replicant who believes that hes Spence. DOnofrio delivers the grimness with enough brio to convince Nelson and probably most of the audience. But Spence wont be put down and escapes death on a surgical table. Checking in with Maya via videophone he realizes that even she has her doubts about him. The dogged Hathaway is Javert to the desperate Spences Jean Valjean but without ""Les Miserables"" -- or most especially author Dicks -- acute social critique and psychological layering. Things are as chase-movie basic as can be and with just enough convenient plot gaps to extend the chase as far as it gets. Spence runs through picturesque wasteland hides in alleys and tenements  and has the kind of kill-me-or-help-me relationship with a young man Cale (Mekhi Phifer) that every movie fugitive hero requires. Spence can get proof of his true identity at Mayas hospital where he can also get Cale the medicine he needs for the quasi-underground hospital he helps run in the boondocks -- but only if Cale helps get him back into the city. ""Impostor"" plods along somewhat efficiently if uninterestingly until a crucial moment in the hospital over an hour into the running time gives the game away as far as Spences true identity is concerned. Its a moment that the filmmakers perhaps felt was ambiguous enough to keep us guessing but is actually so obvious that it utterly saps the final sequencesof any suspense or impact. Sinises rather intense performance is in retrospect quite an act since there is so little for him to build on and so much yardage for him to run from the unflappable growling DOnofrio. It does suggest though what interesting work Sinise could do in a finely made thriller grounded in ideas and character. Stowes gifts for emotional acuity are underused and unlike a much more developed role in sci-fi thriller ""Twelve Monkeys"" she isnt allowed to get out of the starting gate this time. The fine Shalhoub is disposed of early on but Phifer keeps the movies momentum going as a guy just as hard-pressed as Spence. Pics frequent droopiness is hardly helped by dim light levels; entire scenes are nearly lost in the dark. Even with the esteemed Industrial Light amp; Magic as main effects designer pics futurist look is least convincing in its digitals cityscape views and larger effects. Recalling George Lucas ""THX 1138"" Fleder and crew hunt down a marvelous range of actual locations that powerfully render the storys paranoid atmosphere amidst bunker-like architecture.

"USATODAY.com - This Sci-fi flick is an Impostor Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 01/04/2002 - Updated 0824 AM ET This Sci-fi flick is an Impostor By Mike Clark USA TODAY Imposter (out of four) Stars Gary Sinise Madeleine Stowe Tony Shalhoub Vincent DOnofrio Mekhi Phifer Elizabeth Pena Director Gary Fleder Distributor Dimension Films Rating R for strong violence and some language Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction Impostor is opening today at a theater near you. This chase film adapted from a Philip K. Dick story takes place in 2079 a handful of years within the time frame of John Carpenters Ghosts of Mars the last sci-fi movie that was worth so little bother. The cast here is better -- Gary Sinise Madeleine Stowe and Tony Shalhoub -- making the result even more depressing. If Stowe and Shalhoub got paid more than a case of Bud for their very small roles Dimension Films got taken. Sinise however earns his keep; hes all over the place as a guy suspected of being an alien spy impersonating a government scientist married to Stowe. Nothing is as interesting as their home appliances in the early scenes voice-activated showers music players and wall-screen TVs that shut off on command. We should be so lucky when this movie quickly ends up on cable. Vincent DOnofrio (another good actor wasted) who plays Sinises Fugitive-like pursuer is complimented in the studio press release for his ""intense persona"" but this is a kinder way of saying hes overbearing. Of course DOnofrios character is under pressure There could be a massive alien attack and a drugged half-naked Sinise has escaped through his buildings vents into civilization. At least I think that was civilization. The photography by Robert Elswit (who has done impressive-looking movies from The River Wild to Hard Eight) is so dark its tough to tell. The only good thing about Impostor is the appropriateness of its title for a film posing as the first 2002 release. The picture was originally supposed to open in August 2000 around the time DOnofrio was playing Abbie Hoffman in Steal This Movie.

PLEASE VERIFY RIGHTS. Mekhi Phifer left and Gary Sinise in IMPOSTER THIS IS A HANDOUT IMAGE. PLEASE VERIFY RIGHTS. Mekhi Phifer left and Gary Sinise in IMPOSTER Photo HANDOUT The end almost justifies the middle / P.K. Dicks Impostor began life with smaller pretensions 1 / 1 Back to Gallery IMPOSTOR Sci-fi. Starring Gary Sinese. With Madeleine Stowe Vincent DOnofrio and Mekhi Phifer. Directed by Gary Fleder. (PG-13. At Bay Area theaters. 96 minutes.) If this latest sci-fi exercise in paranoia based on a Philip K. Dick story were a short subject instead of a full-length feature it might have really been something. The last 15 minutes finally get it together for what passes as a movie experience with a considerable ""gotcha"" quotient. Until then however this movie is something of an impostor itself stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work apparently intended to hide how thin much of it is. (By all accounts ""Impostor"" was originally intended as one shorter segment of an anthology film not as the stand-alone feature it grew into which may explain the rubbery midsection.) The funny thing is the home stretch shows how good the movie might have been. It could almost stand on its own. Heres my suggestion When the DVD comes out play the beginning setup and then jump ahead to the finale. Save the hour of your life that would have been in between and put it to better use. Gary Sinese plays a weapons engineer in the year 2079 who begins to doubt his own identity. He may be a replicant taken over by alien forces and his ticking heart turned into a ticking bomb -- a kind of unwilling suicide bomber if thats not a contradiction in terms. The one thing that keeps Spence Olham (Sinese) going is his devotion to his wife Maya a physician. Shes played by Madeleine Stowe so the reason for his devotion is easy to see except she doesnt have enough screen time and too much of that is spent talking to him on a video phone or otherwise dutifully reminding us that she is still there. Sinese and Vincent DOnofrio are both good actors whose reputations are starting to seem better than the movies in which they appear. Here theres far too much of DOnofrio as the head of the Earth Security Agency caught in a swirl of hyperactive images that substitute for real action. Hes more in his element in moments of ingratiating menace. Olham ends up on the run and a mysterious figure played by Mekhi Phifer may or may not be a bounty hunter who is after the replicant -- a familiar theme for fans of Dicks books or movies based on them (""Blade Runner""). But dont fall for an attempt to pass off some confusing filmmaking as audience identification with the main characters own confusion about his identity. ""Memento"" this aint. The art direction is one place where from time to time this movie stands out. Earth has been covered by a protective dome and periodically video ""posters"" are thrown against it. Other videos of desirable vistas replace pictures on utilitarian office walls. Glimpses of cityscapes have the look of a future under siege and claustrophobic. Most striking of all a medical ""octopus"" scans Sineses body with lasers and produces holograms of an eerie likeness that fade into X-ray cross-sections. . Contains violence and surgical procedures.
