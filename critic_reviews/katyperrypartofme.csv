By Dana Stevens Katy Perry in Katy Perry Part of Me. Still from Katy Perry Part of Me(c) Paramount Pictures. All rights reserved. Heres the totality of my experience of Katy Perry before walking into her new self-produced concert documentary Katy Perry Part of Me I knew her as a tabloid item the pop star who recently ended her marriage to the English comedian Russell Brand. I was familiar with the assaultively cute style of her music videos--candy-colored cartoonish blending the childlike with the coyly sexual. (The one thats stuck with me the longest unfortunately was the ""California Gurls"" video where she sprays jets of whipped cream out of her bra in slow motion.) And I had heard a good friends 6-year-old daughter belt out ""Firework"" Perrys self-esteem-boosting megahit a few dozen times in impromptu atop-the-couch performances. My own 6-year-old to my relief decided after a brief period of co-""Firework""-belting that ""Katy Perry is too girly."" That pretty much sums up my resistance to Perry too--without knowing much about her music I felt an instinctive aversion to the brand of femininity she peddled. In 2008 she turned the heterosexual party trick of girl-on-girl kissing into her first No. 1 single with ""I Kissed a Girl."" Perrys ode to Sapphic osculation unlike Jill Sobules 1995 song of the same title doesnt celebrate the excitement of sexual self-discovery but the thrill of rebellion of getting away with something titillatingly naughty. Similarly ""Ur So Gay"" approaches straight-up homophobia with its teasing chorus addressed to an effete boyfriend ""Youre so gay/ And you dont even like boys""). In Part of Me much is made of what a rebel Perry is how she inspires her tween- and teenage fans to have the courage to be themselves. But though I left the film with a slightly higher opinion of Perry as a singer and songwriter she continues to strike me as desperately ingratiating A nice pretty Christian girl who just wants as much of the world as possible to love her. The ""nice"" part may well be engineered by the documentary of course All of Perrys on-screen interactions with intimates especially a painfully stiff visit to her grandmother feel as phony and staged as the post-show meet-and-greets with her fans and were left with zero sense of what shes really like as a granddaughter sister boss or friend. As for the ""Christian"" part it matters to Perrys career in a way I hadnt realized before The daughter of traveling Pentecostal ministers she began singing in church and put out a gospel album at the age of 16. (In a few clips of Perry from this period playing acoustic guitar you can hear what her voice sounded like before it was accompanied by a wall of in-studio production sound--its sweet tuneful but not particularly distinctive.) Perrys parents appear briefly to lament their daughters often-revealing costumes and risque persona but they also seem proud of her success. And as for ""pretty"" Well the good Lord has endowed Perry with porcelain skin raven locks and a pair of huge blue eyes that rival Zooey Deschanel in their sheer Japanimation cuteness. She also has a Barbie body at once lithe and voluptuous perfect for the retro-fairy-tale-princess costumes shes known for sporting on stage (one whole number revolves around spectacular costume changes with one ice-cream-hued creation succeeding the next in seemingly endless layers). But as easy on the eye as Perry is moving gracefully on stage is not her forte; in front of her crew of professional backup dancers her modest gifts as a dancer are starkly apparent. I found myself looking forward to the rare moments when she would just stand at the microphone and sing. Advertisement Theres no denying that Perry has a hell of a work ethic and if you like bubbles and dancers in lavender kitten suits and backdrops that recall an 80s-vintage Lisa Frank spiral notebook Im sure she puts on a hell of a show. The 2011 world tour this documentary chronicles was a grueling one with an elaborate two-hour stage show nearly every night of the week for months on end and rare days off spent flying around the world in an attempt to save her crumbling marriage. If youre interested in the details behind the Brand/Perry breakup--well a) get a life but b) you will be sadly disappointed by the dirt on offer here. Brand appears only in the briefest glimpses never sits down for an interview and is rendered in only two harshly contrasting lights First the teddy-bear hubby affectionately snogging with his wife backstage then the cold distant ""One That Got Away"" (to quote Perrys confessional ballad of the same title which we hear in its entirety in teary close-up). Theres no mention of Brands well-documented struggles as an alcoholic and drug addict--in fact there are no unwholesome substances anywhere on view in Part of Me with the exception of the you-go-girl blackout drinking Perry espouses in her mega-hit ""Last Friday Night."" About ""Last Friday Night."" Not to sound like a scold but I agree entirely with the comedian Rob Delaneys brilliant line-by-line breakdown of this song in which he takes the unnamed protagonist (and by association Perry) to task for glamorizing a nightlife that includes unprotected sex with strangers drinking to the point of amnesia and possibly sexual assault. Why do I care whether a pop singer I never voluntarily listen to hits it big with a cute ditty about how awesome it is to spend your Friday nights doing stupid dangerous shit? Maybe because I have a daughter whos a born ham someone who like the younger Katy Perry we see in old home video footage in Part of Me has dreams of standing on a stage one day doing something--singing dancing playing an instrument--in front of a cheering crowd. If and when that time comes I want her to know she has options besides spraying whipped cream out of her bra. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

Starring Katy Perry Director Dan Cutforth Jane Lipsitz Running time 135 Release Opened Jul 5 2012  Editorial Review Peeling back Katys candied coatingBy Stephanie MerryThursday July 5 2012If the 3-D documentary ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" can be trusted the record-setting pop star is not just a blue-haired doll-person but also a goofy sweet and spacey-yet-savvy singer whose main concern is turning average people into candy-coated smile flowers. As a piece of pro-Perry propaganda the entertaining and disarmingly poignant movie from directors and reality television vets Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz is a startling success. Although there are moments when the filmmakers fingerprints are nearly visible on the manipulated putty of an audience the scenes arent enough to break the fruit-flavored spell. The main thread of the movie follows the ""Firework"" singer during 2011. It was a particularly eventful year for Perry who globe-trotted for her sold-out California Dreams Tour and also ended her 14-month marriage to scraggly British comedian Russell Brand. Backstage footage shares screen time with concert numbers old home movies and interviews that chronicle Perrys relatively slow rise to success. Its a compelling story that mixes onstage moments -- including the terrifying spectacle of screaming crying fans -- and behind-the-scenes glances such as Perrys visit to her brassy grandmother who is humorously less sugary sweet than her progeny. Perrys back story as the gospel-crooning daughter of Pentecostal ministers makes for a diverting plot especially considering her first smash hit ""I Kissed a Girl."" The singers thwarted attempts at fame after moving to Los Angeles are equally absorbing. She comes across as smiley yet scrappy the little engine that could write enough rousing hits to soundtrack a super-size spinning class. Most noteworthy is the films ability to summon emotion. In a bit of dramatic irony thanks to People magazine and Us Weekly the audience knows Perrys marriage is over while shes still murmuring on-screen over having found the love of her life. Celebrity marriages with their orchestrations and short life spans can seem trivial but the breakup actually causes a palpable sorrow. Of course discussions of the divorce feel awfully one-sided. There are frequent mentions of Perrys long-haul trips to visit her husband although he purportedly didnt return the favor. Its just one example of the filmmakers more overt machinations which tend to distract raising questions about whats real and whats hyperbole. Speaking of drawbacks the use of 3-D doesnt add much to anything but ticket prices. A few moments during the concerts when lasers or a spray of whipped cream make a convincing entry into the audience arent enough to warrant wearing special glasses for 90 minutes. Besides Perry doesnt need any help popping off the screen whether shes wearing a costume with a pair of eye-catching spinning peppermints or headgear to embody her dorky alter ego Kathy Beth Terry. She isnt afraid to look like a goofball which might be why her army of devotees adores her. But fan or not its hard not to give in to Perrys endearing charms. The filmmakers clearly want the audience to like the singer -- and is that such a bad thing? She is after all cute as a cotton-candy-pink button.

How unpleasant could it be to sit in an air-conditioned theater and gaze upon a cartoonishly curvy pop star prance around in cotton-candy colors? But even that becomes a bit of a chore by the end -- actually by the middle -- of ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" an overlong movie which presents the singer of ""I Kissed a Girl"" (and a slew of other mindless confections) as a savvy and resilient young woman but a remarkably underwhelming performer. Take away the teal wig and the pinwheel pasties and you discover this girl really cant dance. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Part documentary part concert film ""Part of Me"" is drawn from Perrys 2011 ""California Dreams"" tour -- a time were told of ""tremendous success and personal heartbreak"" for the singer whose marriage to hirsute comedian Russell Brand was falling apart as she crisscrossed continents playing to swarms of screaming fans. (We glimpse Brand only briefly and hes given no opportunity to defend himself when the relationship finally collapses.) Advertisement - Continue Reading Below If the movie feels like a feature-length reality TV show -- and it does -- thats because Magical Elves the production team behind ""Top Chef"" and ""Project Runway"" had a hand in its creation. (""Part of Me"" was directed by Magical Elves founders Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz producers of ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never."") Perry of course is the star of this show but theres a cast of reasonably compelling characters who help tell her story including her mother and father a pair of Pentecostal preachers who seem oddly nonplussed by their daughters enormous success. (Perrys mom in particular is an icy presence on screen.) Its Perrys interactions with her fans -- not the Candy Land-inspired stage set -- that gives the movie its real sweetness. Although worn out from the road shes always able to muster a smile for her adoring acolytes at pre-show meet-and-greets and I dare you not to tear up at the tender backstage moment she shares with a young Make-A-Wish admirer. Its also gratifying to see the singer occasionally unmasked stripped of the Day-Glo wigs and sexy corsets. (Is there a pop star who needs 3-D less than Perry?) She is not Jessica Rabbit nor is she a generic knockoff of Avril Lavigne Kelly Clarkson or Lady Gaga with whom she has an amusing encounter at an awards ceremony. But what is she? Just like it says ""Part of Me"" is one aspect of Perry but her fans may leave the movie wanting more. Mark Shanahan can be reached atshanahanglobe.com.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures)By David Hiltbrand Inquirer Staff WriterPosted July 04 2012Katy Perry Part of Me is not a concert film (although there is ample performance footage); it is not a chronicle of this Candy Land Gagas life (although you do learn a great deal about her prefame years).Part of Me is Perrys visually spectacular testimonial to her own indomitable determination to follow her dreams. The fact that the film lends itself to some really colorful Pinterest pages is merely a bonus.The image that will stick with you is of Perry setting the spangled pinwheels on her chest spinning striking a pose holding up her sparkly microphone and smiling to beat the bandwagon as the elevator platform she is standing on raises her up to stage level to face her adoring fans. ShowtimeIts how Perry began every stop on her yearlong globe-girdling ""California Dreams"" Tour just before breaking into her first song ""Teenage Dream."" Because we have already seen all the behind-the-scenes work that goes into producing a super-splashy arena tour like this (seven tour buses 16 trucks) were continually stoked by the plucky professionalism of Katys opening. The first few times.Round about Day 214 fatigue has set in a for the viewers. But even more so for Katy. Because in addition to the notorious grind of touring whenever theres a down minute shes jetting off to spend time with her new hubby Russell Brand (theyve since split).He is as Warren Beatty was in Madonnas similar on-the-road documentary Truth or Dare a rather ghostly figure in the documentary a rare presence in the dressing room and clearly annoyed when he is caught on camera.Katy spends far more time in the film with her friends Mia Moretti and Shannon Woodward (of the Fox sitcom Raising Hope) in settings like the Cat Cafe in Tokyo where one spends a mint to drink tea in a frilly room filled with pampered cats adorned in human fashions.A large Part of Me is devoted to Katys origin story a how she grew up in a strict Pentecostal household. Her younger brother notes ""We werent allowed to eat Lucky Charms growing up because luck was of Lucifer.""Thanks to a superabundance of home video we watch Katy grow from saucer-eyed teen gospel singer to an angry Alanis-wannabe who was dumped by her first label. Its a long and so-familiar-its-almost-tiresome hike to ""I Kissed a Girl"" and pop success a trek that is not all that interesting except to Perrys fans who presumably would go to any movie she made.What is worth seeing a and shelling out the 3-D premium for a is Perrys eye-popping showmanship. The wigs the makeup the costumes. She has for instance a white onesie designed to look like vintage candy buttons on tape.Theres a definite Land of Lollipops fantasia going on in her show. For the encore ""California Gurls"" she puts on a Hersheys Kisses top and sprays the crowd with a whipped cream cannon. Sweet or suggestive? You decide.Talk about a quick-change artist. Perrys miraculous serial costume changes on ""Hot N Cold"" would have Harry Houdini doing a double take.All of this performance footage is splendidly shot and edited. Where you get shortchanged is on the music. Surely it wouldnt hurt to hear a few songs in their entirety even if we had to give up some of the endless meet-and-greets with fans we have to sit through.Part of Me is most intent on pulling back the curtain to show you how hard Katy worked to get where she is and what a trouper she is a setting the pinwheels turning in Brazil only hours after Brand shattered her heart long distance.Unless youre already a Perry fan you may come away from Part of Me feeling taken advantage of. Like you just paid someone to talk about herself for two hours.Contact David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com or follow on Twitter daveondemand_tv.

Shes focused thoughtful and human. Shes not afraid to show herself sans a stroke of makeup or let us see the turmoil of her failed fairy-tale marriage.When I walked into the Katy Perry Part of Me movie screening I was dreading spending the next 95 minutes watching cutesy color overload -- on superfluous 3-D no less. I still dont care for her music which is essentially disposable busily produced radio pop of the day.But I gained respect for Perry her work ethic and personal rediscovery. Framed around the mammoth ""California Dreams Tour 2011"" supporting 2010s Teenage Dream which has sold 5.5 million copies worldwide (2.2 million in the United States) the documentary delves into her family background and her career.As the daughter of pastors Keith and Mary Hudson Perry spent much of her formative years in church singing gospel songs and mingling with fellow worshippers. As evidenced by film footage of Perry at 18 though she clearly had other ideas for her life. At 17 fueled by a game-altering hearing of Alanis Morissettes 1995 blockbuster Jagged Little Pill she recorded an edgy contemporary Christian album titled Katy Hudson. It was a commercial bomb.She sought out record producer and songwriter Glen Ballard (who helmed Pill) and embarked on a seven-year journey to find a record label that grasped her artistic vision. Deals with Island Def Jam and Columbia Records proved fruitless. Capitol finally got it.Perry turned heads with the chart-topping debut single ""I Kissed a Girl"" an irreverent yet quirky sweet number that polarized critics as it thrilled audiences. She has since enjoyed a slew of hit singles including a record-breaking five No. 1 smashes from Teenage Dream.Teenage Dream and similarly 2008s One of the Boys taps into Perrys fascination with fairy tales. Elements of Alice in Wonderland The Wizard of Oz Barbie dolls Sesame Street The Smurfs and even Cirque du Soleil define her songs and stage show. Shes a creative dichotomy a combination of sexed-up adult yet poignant lyrics manifested in dance-pop musical styles and fantasy-land visuals.Her fairy-tale idealism slammed into harsh everyday realities when she met and fell deeply in love with comedic actor Russell Brand. By the time they married in late 2010 Perry was a star and about to embark on the most ambitious trek of her life. The nuptials didnt survive the separation. Brand makes brief almost afterthought appearances in the documentary. The pain in Perrys face is palpable. Her humongous September 2011 concert in Sao Paulo Brazil was near cancellation. As fans hollered outside Perry was in a crying stupor.The show must go on. Life must go on. How bittersweet it was when Perry accompanied her big sister Angela who is her personal assistant to a wedding-dress fitting. Perry whose marriage had just crumbled was about to celebrate her sisters big day. That moment when Perry casually wiped a tear from her eye proved more revelatory than any of her million-selling songs. The pop-star confections are merely window dressing.Katy Perry Part of Me (B)Directed by Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz.

Is she a populist performance artist? A feminist icon? Or just a singer striking a chord at the right cultural moment? After seeing ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" Im still not sure mainly because this self-promotional concert film never gave me a moment to form my own opinion. It opens with fan testimonials from people I dont trust (children teenagers) and continues a blitzkrieg of accolades from people Id call less than objective (managers publicists). None of it feels patently false but nothing in this highly manipulative movie feels entirely true either. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Filmed during Perrys 2011 world tour a triumph marred by a split from her husband actor-comedian Russell Brand ""Part of Me"" is a documentary in style only. Perrys biographical timeline -- from young Christian singer to hardworking megastar -- is interspersed with interviews (""Its like working with a friend"" says Perrys assistant) and concert footage focusing on Perrys elaborate wardrobe. Perrys 2010 album ""Teenage Dream"" became the first ever to generate five No. 1 singles and all are included. ""Part of Me"" directed by reality-show veterans Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz (""Project Runway"" ""Top Chef"") feels mostly harmless except when the subject turns to Brand. Its one thing to scissor him out of the picture -- youll see him maybe thrice -- but ""Part of Me"" carefully builds a case against him portraying Perry as a self-sacrificing wife unceremoniously dumped. (""Shes running herself ragged"" her manager Bradford Cobb testifies laying the groundwork.) The scenes of Perry openly weeping sometimes seem less candid in context. Im willing to believe Perry is everything ""Part of Me"" says she is kind smart talented hardworking deserving of success. I just wish the movie trusted me to decide for myself.

The magic of Katy Perry by contrast is that shell show up to perform in a shiny blue wig with Bettie Page bangs wearing oversize spinning lollipops pinned to her breasts...and damned if she still doesnt look like the girl next door. In the thrilling 3-D concert film Katy Perry Part of Me there are a lot of things to love about Perry from her sweetly sexy and pert beauty to her full-throated voice to the outrageous hookiness of songs like ""Teenage Dream"" and ""Last Friday Night"" (to me her greatest track). Yet you could talk about every one of those things without capturing whats most special about Perry the joy that beams out of her like a holy light. Part of Me works hard to prove its more than a glorified infomercial and one reason it is more is that Perry has a startling story to tell. The daughter of Pentecostal ministers she grew up in a Christian bubble sheltered from pop. But once she embraced pop she did so with an almost religious zeal. The film also documents the breakup of her marriage to Russell Brand and though its glimpsed from the sidelines Perrys despair is on full display. Part of Me demonstrates why feeling the sorrow may help to project the joy.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures) HOEP This film image released by Paramount Pictures shows Katy Perry in a scene from her 3D film ""Katy Perry Part of Me."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures) Candy-coated pop singer Katy Perry reveals the pain behind the lollipops and cupcakes in ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" her new concert documentary that looks at her on and off the stage.And its all in 3-D though its hard to see why unless seeing balloons float off the movie screen does something for you.Many of us already know Perrys history. The singers career exploded like fireworks thanks to hit after hit from her 2010 album ""Teenage Dream"" including her record-breaking ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)."" Meanwhile her personal life took off as well with her marriage to British actor Russell Brand. This doesnt lend itself to obvious documentary fodder and surely there are more interesting subjects but Perry pulls it off coming off as likable and real.Captured on her successful ""California Dreams"" tour (it played Scottrade Center in August) ""Part of Me"" opens with fans testimonials. Katy Cats lovingly speak about how Perry has inspired them. Lady Gaga Justin Bieber and Rihanna are on hand later.While its not quite a warts-and-all story pimples emerge. Clips from concert performances are cannily placed to help tell the story; ""Who Am I Living For"" for example illustrates how the music industry didnt know what to do with her. A teenage Perry is shown strumming along quite terribly it seems as a Christian pop performer under the tutelage of her traveling Pentecostal minister parents. She broke away to do her own thing to much rejection and theres a funny bit where she reacts to the suggestion that she should be the next Avril Lavigne.Though Brand doesnt directly address the camera we see them cuddling during happy times then he disappears from the film. Their separate lives take a heavy toll on the marriage and Perry can barely take the stage in Hartford Conn. depressed over her crumbling relationship. Things are worse at a stop in Brazil where she breaks down backstage. References to her stint on the Vans Warped tour and any mention of her well-chronicled romance with Travis McCoy are missing omissions that make ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" live up to its name.Katy Perry Part of MeThree stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 140  Content Suggestive content language thematic elements and brief smoking Kevin C.

"Katy Perry She made a movie and he liked it ... kinda |       NJ.com comments Katy Perry She made a movie and he liked it ... kinda Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 05 2012 at 600 AM View/Post Comments Paramount PicturesKaty Perry in her movie ""Katy Perry Part of Me."" Here are a couple of things even the most untutored audience can learn from ""Katy Perry Part of Me."" She is not what you would call old for her years. (""A baby cant have a baby"" she announces talking about her reluctance to start a family. ""And Im still a baby."" Note Shes 27.) She is not a terribly complicated lyricist (""I wanna see your peacock"" goes one chorus endlessly) although her entourage disagrees. ""Shes speaks for her generation"" announces one. (Like OMG) She is not particularly wise in the ways of love. (Which we dont need to go into at all beyond repeating two words ""Russell Brand."" Okay three more ""She married him."") But heres what this new film does reveal about Perry. She has a good relationship with her family -- including her preaching Pentecostal parents who you can figure were not thrilled with ""I Kissed a Girl."" She works extremely hard at everything -- her relationship with fans her concerts even for awhile her marriage. And she is incredibly easy to like. ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" is one of those products -- like ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" or ""Hannah Montana amp; Miley Cyrus Best of Both Worlds"" -- that mixes concert footage with ""exclusive"" backstage content. Theyre long-form commercials marketed as movies. But as directed by Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz -- veterans of TV programs like ""Project Runway"" -- real reality sometimes intrudes here. In one scene a clearly exhausted Perry comes close to cancelling a major outdoor concert (but goes on anyway). In another realizing her marriage is ending she breaks down in tears. That goes a bit beyond the usual music documentaries which rarely document anything beyond how beloved their stars are. The movie doesnt push it -- we never get an actual interview for example with Brand. But it remains refreshingly frank particularly when it covers Perrys early days in the business when one label tried to turn her into ""the new Avril Lavigne"" (footage of the naturally sunny Perry trying to fake angst is particularly funny). The concert footage isnt quite as interesting not because Perrys pop isnt perfect in its way but because its too perfect. Everything is so rehearsed so note-for-note from night to night that theres no room for surprise. Sao Paulo or Hartford the show remains the same. Its an occasionally strange show too. With her black-banged wigs and giant prop lollypops Perrys a wild weird combination of pinup girl and grade-schooler -- a Bettie Page lost in Candyland. Its a sometimes queasy mix of Playboy and pubescence and if tweens arent aware of that their parents should be. But Perrys no dope. Songs such as ""Waking up in Vegas"" ""California Gurls"" and ""Teenage Dream"" are singalong hook-heavy hits. And whether its Brazil or Connecticut her arena concerts sell out with thousands of young girls (and quite a number of quirky boys) happily singing along. ""How can you be too cartoony?"" Perry wonders early on. In her case clearly you cant. Ratings note The film contains some suggestive lyrics. Katy Perry Part of Me (PG) Paramount (97 min.) Directed by Dan Cutforth Jane Lipsitz.

Photo Everett Collection I always thought of Katy Perry as sort of the Disney version of Lady Gaga -- similarly over the top but in a really cheery accessible way. The 3-D concert documentary ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" confirms this 100 percent. But it also sheds light on her rather unique path to stardom chronicling the exhaustive level of ambition a young woman must have to achieve what shes done in just a few short years which includes becoming the only female artist to have five chart-topping singles from one album. Deploying a briskly effective humanizing strategy similar to last years ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" directors Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz intersperse immersively three-dimensional footage from Perrys world tour last year with backstage scenes home videos and interviews with her nearest and dearest (the notable exception being the singers then-husband Russell Brand whom she divorced while the movie was being shot). Anyone looking for an explanation for Perrys obsession with fantastical cartoonish trappings will find it in her and her siblings description of their upbringing traveling with their Pentecostal-minister parents. Girlhood-staple stories like ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" were prohibited for being ""satanic"" -- as was the consumption of Lucky Charms (the most pagan of the breakfast cereals apparently). This being the most extensively documented generation yet theres no shortage of video to showcase Perrys progress from gospel crooner to floundering acoustic singer to megastar. So its a little confounding that theres time taken away from her engaging back story and spectacular stage show for interviews with costume and makeup people who while seemingly nice folks dont have anything particularly insightful to add. But Perrys multitudes of devoted fans -- the majority female and tween or teenage but certainly not all -- will feel a vicarious thrill as the singer confides that ""this moment is my childhood dream come true"" as she rises through a hole in the stage clad in a glittery pinwheel dress to perform her songs for a packed stadium. And boy does she give it her all both onstage and off. Effervescent renditions of hits like ""I Kissed a Girl"" -- the torch-song version -- and ""Firework"" and ""Peacock"" make use of the very latest technology to create a concertgoing experience that in a way far surpasses what youd see if you were there in person especially in the cheap seats. Backstage Perry tirelessly works her way through the de rigueur meet-and-greets giving each star-struck child her undivided if brief attention and hammers her team about making sure she gets days off to go see her husband. Brand a sometimes-working actor ""should"" fly out to meet her at various locations on tour Perry admits. ""But he wont."" The marriage crumbles illustrated sparsely but wrenchingly as Perry sobs in her dressing room before a show surrounded by her well-intentioned but puzzled handlers. Ever the professional the pop star has surrounded herself with people who know how to make a tour work -- but none of them seem well-equipped to give a heartbroken 27-year-old girl a much needed hug.

Katy Perry Part of Me Fair to good Directors Dan Cutforth Jane Lipsitz. Cast Katy Perry Shannon Woodward Lucas Kerr. Rating PG-13 for some suggestive content language thematic elements and brief smoking. The documentary directed by Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz follows the massively popular pop star on her 2011 tour and uses old footage some of it home movies to chronicle her rise to stardom. In some respects its one big Katy Perry commercial. But she is so engaging and accessible and just so decent that its hard not to get caught up in the fuss. Her breakup with husband Russell Brand and her reaction to it is included here certainly something she didnt have to agree to include. Interview Katy Perry It doesnt make her music any better but it will give you a different perspective while youre listening to it. And yes you can just feel the last remaining bit of street cred seeping from your body as you acknowledge this -- I saw the Clash live -- but who cares? Of course its not an unbiased perspective but above all ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" makes its star out to be someone deserving of the fame and fortune thats come her way. The film begins with Perrys massive California Dreams tour which would go on for nearly a year. Its an impressive production as we see the now-standard time-lapse montage of the crew building the stage at whatever arena she and the band are playing that night. Of course with Perry her look is as important as her music so there are costume folks makeup artists and more in tow. Whats impressive here is that most of them were with Perry before she got famous. Her loyalty to the people shes known for a long time is a recurring theme in the film and one of her more-attractive qualities. We see old footage of her father a Pentecostal minister preaching and learn from Perry and her sister that their upbringing was strictly religious -- her sister never heard of Michael Jackson until she was 14 -- and somewhat stifling. Perry began writing and signing Christian songs and made an album. But she also heard an Alanis Morissette album and realized that this was more in line with what she wanted to do. She left home for Los Angeles when she was 17. The typical music-business struggles followed though in Perrys case it seems more cruel than most with labels signing her and trying to shape her into the latest pop-tart sensation. Perry writes songs so she resisted getting dropped and resigned. We get a good sense of how hard she worked before anyone knew who she was. Her first big hit was ""I Kissed a Girl"" and one of the movies highlights is watching the filmmakers discuss the song with her parents. (Perrys father by the way seems by the looks of it to have changed his affiliation to the Church of the Aging Hipsters.) Her mother doesnt much approve of the song but she clearly is proud of her daughter and her success. We see Brand from time to time backstage and throughout the grueling tour whenever she has a few days off Perry flies to wherever he is to be with him. The disintegration of their relationship appears to happen somewhat suddenly though her manager says it was a shock to everyone that Perry hid it. This is when we see Perry at her most vulnerable barely able to go onstage at one point before rallying to the occasion. Again in a film like this we see what the artist wants us to see (or will allow us to) but she shows a lot of resilience. None of this -- including the elaborate 3-D concert footage -- is going to make you like such songs as ""California Gurls"" ""Teenage Dream"" and ""Firework"" any more or any less. Perry is an unapologetic pop star and her music reflects that -- its not for everyone. ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" probably isnt either. But it presents Perry as a likable hard-working artist someone you root for even if shes not on your iPod. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Photo Paramount Pictures Katy Perry Part of Me review Pitfalls to fame 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Katy Perry Part of Me  Documentary. Starring Katy Perry. Directed by Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Any self-produced documentary about oneself is bound to be a propaganda film but ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" is a good one and a persuasive one. It may even be a true one. Who knows? Certainly audiences will come away admiring Perrys long struggle for stardom marveling at the stresses of a concert tour and liking and maybe even respecting her music. ""Part of Me"" is an onstage and backstage look at Perrys 2011 tour which was worldwide and went on for a year and sounds a lot more glamorous than the workaday reality. On the plus side this was her lifes dream. She had five No. 1 hits off the same album and at 26 she was making enough money to take her through the next dozen lifetimes in style. On the other hand it was a matter of give give give around the clock every day for months on end. We see her at the beginning of the tour fresh and ready and by the end completely exhausted and nerve-shattered crying for no reason and basically doing an imitation of herself just to get through routine social encounters. Perry became an overnight success with the song ""I Kissed a Girl"" but the documentary shows that years and years of struggle preceded that breakthrough. Her frustration must have been overwhelming Twice she came within inches of stardom. In the first case she signed with a hit-making producer but nothing happened. Then she signed with Columbia which had no idea what to do with her - but were reluctant to let her go. Perry endured five years of hope doubt and disappointment during which she was perceived as ""damaged goods"" within the industry. Until she was somebody she was absolutely nobody. Her friends and employees - some are both - all speak well of her but its easy to speak well of your boss on camera especially in your boss movie. What does stand out is that Perry once she did make it brought along her hairstylist and her clothes designer who were at the time complete unknowns. She also appears to be on good terms with her parents who are evangelical preachers and even with her nasty old grandmother who doesnt have a nice thing to say about anything at least not on camera. According to ""Part of Me"" Perry arranged her tour so that she would work two weeks at a time - at one point she does 18 concerts in a row - with three-day breaks so that she could fly to see her (now ex) husband Russell Brand. Just thinking about that kind of schedule is tiring. Imagine doing it. Brand himself shows up on the tour only once or at least only once that we see. So were left with the impression (which may or may not be true) of a devoted and overworked wife repeatedly flying off to see this rather weird and under-appreciative husband. In between the life details we get the music and the concert footage and these scenes are fun sometimes exhilarating. Personally I dont gravitate to pop extravaganzas that have dancers and mimes and set choreography but that seems to be the standard these days. But the songs are good. Perry is not an intellectual like Lady Gaga. Her songs dont get better the more you hear them. But they address what its like to be a young person in this decade and Im pretty sure that if I were 16 Id see Perry as some kind of goddess. As it stands her music gets under your skin and makes you feel good - and the movie makes you feel good about Katy Perry.   Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Katy Perry Part of Me peeks behind the veneer Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview Katy Perry Part of Me peeks behind the veneerThe Katy Perry Part of Me 3-D concert film shows theres more to the pop star than meets the eye.July 04 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Katy Perry in a scene from her 3-D film ""Katy Perry Part of Me."" (Paramount Pictures )In the glittery new 3-D concert film ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" the pop star asks with sweet conviction ""How could you ever be too cartoony?""On one level the movies answer is that you cant a and lots of rock star highs Russell Brand lows and a whole lot of bubbly music fill up this frothy bit of show and tell. (Its delivered through special bubble-gum pink and cotton-candy blue 3-D glasses to boot.) But directors Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz have gotten past the cartoonish veneer to discover there is more to Perry than meets the eye. ""Part of Me"" does a solid job of filling in the good stuff though if there is any dirt to be uncovered you wont find it here.Cutforth and Lipsitz producers on last years""Justin Bieber Never Say Never""have created a backstage / back story pass to Perryland that is good summer fun. The film sweeps in her early years with her Pentecostal pastor parents getting her first guitar at 13 the dues-paying time on the club circuit and the fame she has today. Her conservative mom and dad may not have let Perry watch""The Smurfs""when she was a kid but praise the Lord they took a lot of home movies. In the shots of 5-year-old Katy performing gospel songs there are glimmers of the moves that are iconic today a the wink-and-a-nod way she plays to the audience those Betty Boop eyes that perfectly timed smile.VIDEOA Katy Perry wants to go into a cave after movie premiereFor serious fans a and they are legion a the film will probably serve as more a celebration of all things Katy than a revelation. From the snippets of interviews with the hopelessly devoted that are woven through the film it certainly seems that they already know her as well as a pop star can be known a every lyric every fashion choice every tweet.For the rest of the collective consciousness the film fills in the before and after of the star who was basically born when she ""kissed a girl"" and she liked it. That was 2008 when the track ""I Kissed a Girl"" propelled Perry out of relative obscurity and sent her on her way to become the first woman to have five No. 1 singles from a single album.That music is the medium here. The film shadows her on her yearlong ""California Dreams"" tour in 2011. Her Candyland / Alice in Wonderland staging and style is a natural for big 3-D treatment. A cacophony of primary colors balloons confetti sequins and glitter keep bursting across the screen.The theme if there is one is that whatever success has brought her she is and always was a good girl at heart a more nice than naughty. Family still surrounds Perry a sister Angela works for her grandma goes to concerts and mom dad and brother arent far. She makes time for her fans. She is loyal to her friends. Before it starts to feel too saintly 2011 was also the year her marriage to British rock comic Brand crumbled. Her frustration is visible as she searches her calendar for her ""relationship days"" a alone time with Brand that she religiously scheduled. And the tears are definitely real ones when it becomes clear the union is over just as she is about to take the stage in Sao Paulo. But the show does go on.It would be easy to dismiss Perry as just another manufactured pop star a in the right light she even looks like Disneys Snow White come to life. So the film does her a service piecing together via footage and interviews the years when she was searching to find the artist she would become. Clips of her around 13 show her struggle to channel raw emotions into music. There are funny shots of Perry trying out some Avril Lavigne rock rage which one of her ex-advisors thought might make her a star.As one record executive put it for too long the industry tried to make Katy Perry into something or someone else. The secret which ""Part of Me"" captures quite nicely was to just let her be.--Katy Perry Part of MeMPAA ratingA PG for some suggestive content language thematic elements and brief smokingRunning timeA 1 hour 40 minutesPlayingA In general releasebetsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESKaty Perry discusses Kristen Stewart-Robert Pattinson John...July 30 2013Katy Perry Russell Brand told me about divorce via text...June 18 2013Katy Perry wants to go into a cave after movie premiere...June 27 2012Katy Perry Part of Me shows all Russell Brand split...May 22 2012Katy Perry Russell Brand buy home in Sunset Strip areaJune 27 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesBusinessFilmKaty PerryCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-katy-perry-part-of-me-20120705,0,1992212.story",200,katyperrypartofme15,katyperrypartofme,latimes

And thats generally what you get. Theres a lot of that stereotypical material in Katy Perrys new tour doc ""Part of Me"" but hers has something Justin Biebers didnt During her ""California Dreams"" tour Perry also was juggling a marriage (to Russell Brand) that would fall apart while she was on the road. The cameras are there not only when Perrys on top of the world giddily trying on lavish costumes and performing for thousands of avid fans but also while shes sobbing right before taking the stage in Brazil. Its heartbreaking to watch. Even if you find Perrys music vapid and candy-coated the girl watched five singles off the ""Teenage Dream"" album go to No. 1 which not even the Beatles could say they did. Like Lady Gaga her slick pop music and kittenish persona appeal to the ""weird kids"" and the masses alike so her megastardom cant come as a complete surprise. ""Part of Me"" details her rise from Pentecostal childhood to teen gospel singer to behemoth touring machine with pinwheels on her boobs spliced with 3-D footage from her shows. (In this instance 3-D is more pleasurable than headache-inducing; you feel like youre in the audience.) It appeals to our voyeuristic nature giving us plenty of backstage passes to see the naturally pretty Perry turn into a lush lacquered doll pre-show sing her heart out and then drag herself to do countless meet-and-greets with fans. Shes an old-fashioned workhorse performer with irresistible charisma. She is constantly surrounded by Team Katy a coterie of old friends from her days as a struggling pop star in Los Angeles. Her traveling-minister parents are supportive; her sex appeal is always tongue-in-cheek. Perry says that although her faith has strayed from the strict guidelines of her childhood she retains a personal relationship with God. Perry comes across as aggressively likable especially when she takes off the electric blue wig and gets ""real."" You root for her. ""This tour is my childhood dream ... to wear sparkly costumes and have people listen to me sing"" she says. KATY PERRY PART OF ME  out of 4 stars Rating PG for some suggestive content language thematic elements and brief smoking. Its the struggle of career vs. love that is most interesting; Perry makes sure to take ""relationship days"" during her tour to fly to Brand. It doesnt work out. In the midst of her painful divorce she watches her sister try on wedding gowns and the devastation on her face is evident. ""Part of Me"" succeeds because its not afraid to let its big star be vulnerable. Her post-divorce interview feels real. ""Im a romantic. ... I still believe in the fairy tale"" Perry says. Thats why it hurts to see Perry standing beneath the stage of her circus tour trying to pull herself together to perform for a massive Sao Paulo crowd. You feel Team Katy members in the wings holding their collective breath as she fights back tears and paints on a smile. For Katy Perry the show must (and does) go on.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a scene toward the end of Katy Perry Part Of Me where the singer is faced with the decision to cancel her show in Sao Paulo Brazil or go onstage in spite of the fact that her short-lived marriage to comedian Russell Brand has just imploded. The Perry of this scene stands in stark contrast to the figure the film has touted up to this point a neon-hued goofball just oozing charisma and charm who asks without irony ""How can you ever be too cartoony?"" Her faded pink hair half-tucked beneath a wig cap she sobs wordlessly while curled in the fetal position removing her Brand-gifted jewelry one piece at a time as her handlers look on and mutter in worried voices. A few moments later shes made her way to the platform beneath the stage and in full concert regalia--a peppermint-swirl-themed bustier with spinning breastplates--chokes back sobs as she struggles to plaster on a smile before ascending to a sea of chanting fans. Its an instance of genuine emotion in a film thats chock-full of manufactured artifice (and proud of it) and it sets up a spontaneous moment where Perrys fans fortify her at a crucial point a legitimately poignant experience thats worth more than all the films various platitudes combined. And boy are there platitudes. Part Of Me comes from the same studio and distributer as 2011s Justin Bieber Never Say Never and its a nearly note-for-note re-creation of that films mix of inflated origin story fan-service montage and sparkly 3-D concert footage. It hits all the same rising-pop-phenomenon beats ""It Gets Better""-style webcam confessionals from fans praising the Power Of Perry; old videos recounting Perrys early days as the God-fearing daughter of Pentecostal ministers; and various managers and family members gravely recounting Perrys struggle to ascend from the Christian-music ghetto through a quagmire of major-label jumping and into the warm welcoming bosom of Capitol Records. Presented as a combination of talking-head interviews and home video interspersed with concert footage and occasional moments of staged fan interaction Part Of Me often feels like the offspring of E True Hollywood Story and an infomercial for Katy Perry Inc. But then theres Brand lurking in the background during the early performances of Perrys 11-month California Dreams world tour a reminder that Perry has at least one more big leather-pantsed speed bump ahead on her whirlwind victory lap. Part Of Me makes an effort to transition from the Brand fiasco to an uplifting conclusion but its half-hearted at best as Perry continues to visibly struggle against tears as she talks about moving on and helps her sister pick out a wedding dress while making maudlin jokes about putting one on hold for herself. There are interesting themes to be gleaned from the whole marriage debacle especially combined with the artifice-as-true-self ideals that make up the Perry mythology; but they have little room to develop within the docu-concert format and are quickly shooed away to make room for more eye-popping 3-D live footage. Were it a pure concert film Part Of Me would be an exhilarating if somewhat cheap movie-going experience There are few live performances better-suited to the 3-D format than Perrys what with its numerous mid-song costume changes army of dancers and aerialists and barrage of 3-D-friendly accoutrements like bubbles lasers and foam cannons. Its pure eye candy and proud of it; hell Perry herself dresses as literal candy more often than not. But the songs are rarely presented in full serving instead to comment upon and transition between the documentary elements. Although there are strong elements on both sides of the films documentary-concert film hyphenate Part Of Mes hybrid format ultimately proves an uneasy marriage and does a disservice to Perry as both a performer and a human being by never reconciling what happens in the space between those two lives.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures) By Jake Coyle AP Entertainment Writer / July 3 2012 E-mail| Print| Text size - + E-mail E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. Its a good thing the makers of ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" arent in politics. Theyd probably steal the election.""Part of Me"" and its forerunner ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" are mesmerizing pieces of pop propaganda. Both 3-D concert films give a reality TV-style portrait of a young star scrubbed clean at the pinnacle of pop touring sold-out arenas while making Herculean sacrifices always finding time for their fans and goofing around with their entourages of stylists and assistants.Theyre unabashedly commercial movies made about unabashedly commercial enterprises. And yet theyre kind of fascinating.Thats because ""Part of Me"" is as good a document youre likely to find of modern pop stardom how its packaged how its sold and what kind of power it holds over screaming `tween girls.The film directed by reality show veterans Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz (the pair produced ""Never Say Never"" as well as shows like ""Top Chef"" and ""Project Runway"") follows Perrys 2011 California Dreams world tour. The 124-concert extravaganza came on the heels of her hit album ""Teenage Dream"" the only album to chart five No. 1 hits for a female performer.A large chunk of the film is made up of 3-D footage of the concerts (songs like ""Firework"" and ""California Gurls"") performed on candy-colored stages that look like Willy Wonka threw up on. (All of the footage was shot by other filmmakers and later assembled by Cutforth and Lipsitz who came aboard only to stitch the film together in editing.)But much of the documentary is spent telling ""Katys story"" and certainly the blue-haired dinner-plate eyed 27-year-old makes for a compelling character. Raised by traveling Pentecostal ministers Perry first tried Christian songwriting as a 13-year-old and later in Los Angeles went through various incarnations before emerging as a star with ""I Kissed a Girl.""As artificial as much of the apparatus surrounding Perry may be none of it works without her charisma at the center. That comes through in ""Part of Me"" as does her intense drive to succeed after early failures. Many of those who helped along the way are here to sing her praises and take credit for their foresight of her talent like her slick manager Bradford Cobb.""Part of Me"" though doesnt succeed as a full picture of Perry. A less PG-friendly more complicated version of the star surely exists off-screen. The film often feels like a tease showing only well part of Perry.The ""money shot"" of the film is when cameras catch Perry crying in her dressing room following her split from husband Russell Brand (whos seen fleetingly backstage).Its an honest moment. The finest shot of ""Part of Me"" is Perry seconds before she goes on stage that night in Sao Paulo Brazil bent over sobbing and then seconds later -- with the professionalism of a true performer -- papering over the heartbreak with a broad smile while chants for ""Kay-Tee"" roar and the peppermint-colored wheels on her dress start to spin.The moment would mean more if it was accompanied by more context of Perrys emotional life rather than served up as evidence of her humility. But thats the sleight of hand of ""Part of Me"" which can even use genuine sorrow to feign depth.Watching ""Part of Me"" through aqua- and pink-colored 3-D glasses in a crowd of girls singing along Perrys songs dont feel vapid but rather like anthems of self-empowerment. The pop experience -- exuberant superficial fun crass -- could hardly be mirrored better.""Katy Perry Part of Me"" a Paramount Pictures release is rated PG for some suggestive content language thematic elements and brief smoking. Running time 97 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.------Motion Picture Association of America rating definitionsG -- General audiences. All ages admitted.PG -- Parental guidance suggested.

Or ""Celine Through the Eyes of the World."" Or any number of other label-endorsed infomercials for globally adored pop phenoms. Breathless teary-eyed testimonials from super-fans? Check. Grueling exhausting tour? Check. Weary performer still making time to visit with trembling audience members? Check. Third-act will-the-show-go-on-oh-yes-it-will drama? Check. Substitute ""divorce from Russell Brand"" for ""throat nodule"" and ""California Gurls"" for ""Baby"" or ""I Drove All Night"" and these movies are pretty much indistinguishable. The trudging devotion to formula would be more forgivable if ""Part of Me"" did a better job at capturing whats ostensibly the point of the documentary Katy Perrys music. As it is there isnt a single song here thats performed in its entirety or performed start to finish without an interview or a backstage happening or something else interrupting the proceedings. Thats disappointing because Perrys touring show incorporates a staggering amount of stagecraft from the sets (imagine Willy Wonka managing a Club Libby Lu franchise) to the costumes (during ""Hot and Cold"" Perry does costume quick-changes that any magician would admire) to the extraordinary efforts of her backup dancers. Granted shes the commodity being sold here but Perry herself comes off as charismatic and energetic an evangelists daughter whos preaching her own gospel of self-expression and non-conformity albeit a mass-market-friendly candy-colored brand of rebellion. The movie goes out of its way to paint her as a hard worker who gives it all for her fans to the point where in Sao Paulo Brazil she rouses herself from a crying jag brought on by the dissolution of her high-profile marriage to Brand literally paints on a smile and knocks the socks off the largest crowd for whom shes ever performed. Documentaries like this operate almost like political campaigns -- the faithful are already sold the haters wont be won over no matter what and then there are the folks in the middle that might or might not be swayed. Its hard to imagine anyone escaping the onslaught of Perrys hugely successful album which made her the first woman to rank five No. 1 hits from the same record but ""Part of Me"" doesnt showcase those singles to their advantage. Perry is one of the modern masters of those earworm pop ditties that bore their way into your brain and refuse to let go and as much fun as it is to watch her belt out ""Firework"" or ""Teenage Dream"" ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" never trusts its audience to have attention span enough to hear the songs all the way through and without truncation. Perhaps a better title would have been ""Katy Perry Parts of My Songs."" Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Her hits are powerful stuff coming from an artist who was raised by Pentecostal preachers who declared most contemporary culture and anything involving fairy-tale-style magic off-limits. In Katy Perry Part of Me those parents gush with support for the daughter who penned the chorus ""I wanna see your peacock cock cock."" The film (presented in never-less-necessary 3-D) documents Perrys 2011 world concert tour to support her massive Teenage Dream record and weaves together onstage and backstage footage with interviews with Perry and her team while home movies and video diaries dating back a decade suggest Perry has been calculatedly filming herself in preparation for this moment.An advertisement of a product targeted at people who are already consuming it Part of Me is completely uninterested in the contradictions that propel Perrys persona. Instead directors Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz track Perrys odyssey from failed teenage gospel singer to Alanis Morissette wannabe to world-beating superstar who learns while on tour that she has broken the record for most number-one singles off a single album for any female star ever. But fame it comes at a priceThe filmmakers seem primarily interested in the tour itself as a source of b-roll illustration (the hyper-cutty pace means numbers are rarely shown from beginning to end) and so the failure of Perrys marriage to Russell Brand gives Part of Me its only semblance of a narrative arc. Brand is a peripheral figure in the film and the movie insists in his then-wifes life. Much is made of Perrys insistence on using her few days off to jet around the world to visit Brand rather than rest. Notable for a movie about a woman who makes a living selling a drag exaggeration of female sexuality stripped of actual sex for consumption by children the films most potent statements on gender come in the section describing how the show almost did not go on like once or twice because Perry was so worn out from ""trying to keep my marriage alive.""An early shot of a pre-celebrity Perry posing with Judy Garlands star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame turns out to be Chekhovian Part of Me later takes a cue from Garlands great A Star Is Born depicting Perrys ability to snap out of a marriage-sparked crying jag when its time to go onstage to sing ""The One That Got Away"" (the song title itself an echo of Garlands Star ballad ""The Man That Got Away""). Like Garlands character Perrys character (and it is a character) turns personal loss into professional power sacrificing herself to the crowd to be resurrected by their devotion.This blatantly patched-together strain suggests that Part of Mes commercial purpose is in part to assimilate the tabloid narrative about Perrys offscreen life which she presumably doesnt fully control into the on-screen narrative of her onstage life over which her control is total. But her savvy for self-presentation though admirable from a business standpoint makes for a more boring movie. You never get the sense that the camera was ever allowed to see anything that Perry didnt want it to see.Or hear. The film is threaded through with hagiographic assessments from Perrys hangers-on regarding her talent her cultural importance and most laughably her authenticity. In insisting that Perry is as one member of the team puts it ""like a real girl""--a simile that has a range of connotations from Pinocchio to porn--theyre willfully misrepresenting Perrys appeal. Were talking about a pop star who invented a headgear-rocking-nerd alter-ego for the video for ""Last Friday Night"" a song about binge drinking and threesomes; she has to know shes selling a blown-out fantasy of party-girl invincibility to an audience too young to recognize the gulf between a living cartoon singing ingeniously insipid lyrics and an actual adult womans reality. ""Thank you so much for believing in my weirdness"" Perry tells one crowd. Its maybe the most honest moment in the movie--an acknowledgement that Katy Perrys brand depends on a suspension of disbelief.

Except in Katy Perrys case its a story of a good girl done good. Her parents - travelling ministers - havent disowned her for strutting on stage half-naked singing about kissing girls and asking in a song to see your peacock cock cock. Grandma Perry just grins that Perry is a show-off and Dad is happy that the ministry hasnt given him the heave-ho.Part of Me offers charming insights into Perrys rise to fame. Filmed during 2011 it captures the highs lows flamboyant costumes rigorous routines and madness of Perrys touring life. When she becomes the first woman to bag five Number One singles from one album youll feel genuinely pleased for her and when Russell Brand files for divorce youll well up as Perry has a teary wobble before showtime. Surprisingly whats most involving is the 3D. I ducked Perrys whipped-cream gun and jolted when I thought a cinemagoer was climbing on stage during a concert. You may go for the story but the performances and quirks leave you with an experience.

Chronicling her California Dreams Tour Part of Me relentlessly pushes Perry as both cartoonish and family-friendly then piles on footage of teens singing along to her breakout ode to bisexual experimentation ""I Kissed a Girl""--a reminder that her current public identity is a well-honed trial-and-error construction. The 3-D performance footage is impressively lavish though the films unending idolization of the amiable singer will quickly exhaust all but the most devoted fans.

Area theaters. Obviously self-produced concert documentaries are just another element in a pop stars publicity effort. But examples in recent years from the likes of Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber have been unusually good-natured. The goal is not to enlighten but to entertain. So while parents buy tickets with the understanding that theyre contributing to a marketing machine kids come away awed and delighted by such an up-close-and-personal experience. ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" fits neatly into this genre offering a superstar who could be the viewers ultra-cool big sister. Naturally we have no way of knowing whether Perry is really as down to earth as the movie suggests despite all the relatives and employees who attest to her awesomeness. Still theres no faking fun. For audiences the most valuable aspect of concert movies like these isnt the stars carefully crafted personal promotion. Its the chance at relatively cheap front-row seats for a show you never got to see live (or loved so much you want to see again). And Perrys stage presence is undeniably irresistible. Candy-coated cartoon meta-sex kitten secret geek Perry plays every angle with impressive ease both onstage and off. Directors Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz (who also worked on the Bieber doc) cannily intercut the personal and professional. A high-energy ""Teenage Dream"" represents her exciting rise to the top ""Not Like the Movies"" reflects her troubles with (now ex-) husband Russell Brand and a heartfelt ""The One That Got Away"" comes as she deals with their divorce. That breakup actually serves as the films emotional centerpiece guaranteeing an even deeper connection between a vulnerable Perry and the girls (and boys) who love her. One might wonder what Brand thinks about such a one-sided account of their relationship but dont expect to hear any complaints from her fan base. Adults will see an impressively savvy businesswoman; tweens will notice nothing but the fireworks (which would have been impressive enough without the overpriced 3-D ticket). ""My goal is super-simple"" Perry coyly insists even as she helms an exceedingly complex back-breaking tour around the globe. ""Its just to make people smile."" Mission accomplished. Perry may be the worlds most high-profile tease but she sure knows how to show us a good time.

"Review Katy Perry Part of Me - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Katy Perry Part of Me If you see only one 3-D concert film this summer ... 1/2 Katy Perry Part of Me Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Paramount Pictures does not lie The chipper no-warts-and-all tour chronicle ""Katy Perry Part of Me"" is indeed the 3-D movie music event of the summer. The only one I believe. Unless Christopher Nolans""The Dark Knight Rises"" turns out to be in 3-D featuring duets sung by men in peculiar facial accessories.The Perry film which never lingers long on any one number or mood or faaaabulous outfit was shot last year when the pop star and wide-eyed emblem of sexy (but not too) Southern California kookdom (never enough never enough kook) crisscrossed the world on her ""California Dreams Tour."" A brief marriage to comedian and actor Russell Brand provoked the eventual heartbreak all megastar divas must suffer if not necessarily with Russell Brand en route to shining even more brightly on stage smiling through tears. The one true moment of poetry in ""Part of Me"" which was directed by ""Top Chef"" and ""Project Runway"" alums Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz finds Perry below an arena stage standing alone on a little elevator platform ready for her entrance. She looks crestfallen unsure a global phenomenon temporarily lost. Then the crowds chants of ""Kay-Tee KAY-TEE"" begin and the twirly top thingies shes wearing on her breasts seem to pick up speed as if propelled not by hand-held remote but by the very love of the crowd. Im not sure what this moment says other than ""Look at em go"" But all great art contains some essential ambiguity that cannot be diagramed.Brand is glimpsed briefly backstage in what might be called the Warren Beatty ""Truth or Dare"" cameo appearance. What do we learn from the film other than the only thing that looks cool in this pointless 3-D context is laser stage lights shooting at your face? We learn that Perry eternal gurl-woman has a grandma in Vegas. We learn that her father wears black eyeglasses resembling Irving ""Swifty"" Lazars. She works hard probably too hard. She always wanted to be a star and the bi-curiouser and curiouser ""I Kissed a Girl"" did the trick followed by many other tricks. Twitter should be thrilled with the on-screen exposure it receives here as Perrys clearly logoed tweets (along with those of others) appear as pop-up punctuation amid the general well-manicured tumult. I find Perry likable in her camera-friendliness. Shes one of these characters who for all we know came out of the womb holding a 1984-model video camera filming away She has that Jenny McCarthy-but-raised-a-Pentacostal-Christian shamelessness and drive and a great smile. The movie whatever. But when you see and hear so many fans of so many backgrounds expounding on what ""Firework"" means to them you realize that while a song may or may not be for you it most certainly is for others.mjphillipstribune.comKaty Perry Part of Me -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG (for some suggestive content language thematic elements and brief smoking)Running time 135Opens Thursday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Music Katy Perry Movies Russell Brand Christopher Nolan Paramount Pictures 10 movies to see this summer Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0703-katy-perry-20120704,0,7801092.column",200,katyperrypartofme26,katyperrypartofme,chicagotribune

TWITTER The movie more of an adulatory artist profile than a bona fide concert doc features a mix of interviews reality TV-style behind-the-scenes footage and 3D concert scenes. Mega-pop stardom doesnt always translate well to film with more than a few musicians proving just too unmarketable on camera for any number of reasons. Singer-songwriter Katy Perry could turn out to be just the opposite however; if the new documentary featuring the multiplatinum star gets major traction fans could develop a decided preference for her onscreen image rather than simply settling for her music. Although Katy Perry Part of Me might not convert legions of new admirers that hardly matters with the well-proven scope of her following. Regardless this is still powerhouse counterprogramming opposite the Amazing Spider-Man onslaught and should pay healthy dividends over the Fourth of July holiday weekend and on through the summer as it accumulates substantial repeat business. Whether Mondays sneak previews in 100 cities specifically for Perrys Twitter followers will boost attendance depends on converting online adherents to actual ticket buyers a major unknown. PHOTOS Katy Perry Pops Candy-Colored Princess By now the details of Perrys life and career are perhaps too well known Raised in a Pentecostal Christian family in Santa Barbara Calif. she recorded a religious-themed album as a teenager and then headed for the bright lights of Los Angeles where she struggled as a singer-songwriter bouncing between a couple of labels before settling at Capitol Records which released her 2008 major-label debut One of the Boys. Several tracks from that release co-produced by Glen Ballard (who guided Perrys professional role model Alanis Morissette) subsequently blew up including the boyfriend-bashing ""UR So Gay"" anthemic ""Hot N Cold"" and breakout hit ""I Kissed a Girl."" The albums mix of confessional -- if rather superficial -- introspection and sexed-up sassiness set the stage for 2010s Teenage Dream Perrys follow-up that made her the only female performer to chart five No. 1 hits on a single album -- tying all-time record-holder Michael Jackson with the likes of ""California Gurls""  ""Firework"" and the title track. By the time her totally sold-out 22-country California Dreams tour came around in 2011 Perry 27 already was a major star with a sizable entourage whimsically produced high-tech stage shows and a celebrity-actor boyfriend British comedian Russell Brand. Launching a yearlong 124-show tour across Europe South America and Asia before returning to the U.S. Perry seems determined to show shes the hardest-working chick in showbiz even if she makes clear she has a platoon of handlers stylists and backup singer-dancers supporting her. VIDEO Behind the Scenes of THRs Katy Perry Cover Shoot An amalgam of angsty singer-songwriters and celebrity starlets -- including Morissette Liz Phair and bad-girl-phase Britney Spears not to mention Marilyn Monroe and Rita Hayworth -- Perrys carefully crafted persona is pitched to appeal to (mostly) female enthusiasts of nearly any age but quite a few boys and men are onboard with her sexy self-empowerment pop message as well. With lavishly applied makeup outrageously colored hairstyles and eye-popping costumes emphasizing her bust- and waistlines Perry sometimes impresses as a dress-up doll with attitude. Aggressively promoting the movies tagline ""Be yourself and you can be anything"" her on-camera interviews and archival footage from her childhood position Perry as a driven artist inspired by a personal dream that she has pursued relentlessly. And her musical talent is considerable She writes or co-writes her songs; performs with powerful alternately sweet and raspy vocals; and accompanies herself on acoustic and electric guitar. Her pop-powered songwriting is distinctly pitched to appeal to a broad demographic consisting primarily of white middle-class fans attracted to catchy tunes and sassy lyrics. The filmmakers go to significant lengths to establish the behind-the-scenes tone of the production giving notable on-camera time to Perrys manager Bradford Cobb; her personal assistant Perrys sister Angela a tour co-producer; and even her stylist and makeup artist. While the filmmakers dont attempt to hide the slightly scandalous details of her shift away from her strict Christian upbringing and brief disastrous marriage to Brand whether any of these scenes are actually scripted is perhaps debatable but more than a few appear set to capitalize on the inherent drama of the tour and Perrys outsized personal life. Perrys parents still traveling Pentecostal ministers as well as her older sister younger brother and sprightly grandmother lend a more intimate perspective to the project. The performer features in almost all of these scenes too reinforcing the impression that the film is as much about Perry the brand as it is about the music. THR Cover Katy Perry on Russell Brand the Media and Conversations With God I Still Believe ""Katy Kats"" followers are equally devoted to both Perry the performer and Perry the musician. The sex-kitten alternative to Lady Gagas perplexing chameleon persona her charisma with concertgoers is impressive as she chats them up at carefully managed backstage meet-and-greets or pulls them out of the crowd to dance ecstatically with her entourage onstage. ""I feel a bit like I live in a fairytale"" she says at one point and seems determined to deliver the same experience at her concerts. Perrys live shows are spectacles of excess with massive candy-colored sets theatrical stage lighting and flashy pyrotechnics. Although interviews absorb a significant amount of the total running time the live performance footage delivers in an equally visceral way with Perry parading out hits like ""E.T."" ""Part of Me"" ""Hot N Cold"" ""Teenage Dream"" ""Peacock"" and a stripped-down version of ""I Kissed a Girl"" then wrapping up the movie with two of her biggest hits. Released by Paramounts Insurge Pictures label and directed by Magical Elves Productions duo Dan Cutforth and Jane Lipsitz (the studio-filmmaker team behind Justin Bieber Never Say Never) Part of Me is a slickly produced entertainment package crafted to appeal directly to Perrys core following -- 22.4 million of them on Twitter alone. (Twitter is pairing with the star and Insurge to promote the film which features frequent onscreen tweets from Perrys fans.) EXCLUSIVE Katy Perry to Launch Her Own Record Label A mix of interviews reality TV-style behind-the-scenes footage and 3D concert scenes the movie is attractively if conventionally assembled. The live performances in particular feature an energized sheen sometimes missing from Perrys music videos featuring the very same songs. Although arguably more of an adulatory artist profile than a bona fide concert doc the movie is still likely to surpass even Perrys personal aspiration -- ""My goal is simple to make people smile.""
