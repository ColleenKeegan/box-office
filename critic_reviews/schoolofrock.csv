Watch a clip from the film ""Headhunters."" Video courtesy of Magnolia Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern April 26 2012 500 p.m. ET Height matters. Thats the short and long of it for the charming sometimes bumbling hero of this one-of-a-kind thriller. At 5 feet 6 inches Roger Brown looks up to his gorgeous statuesque wife with anxiety. ""You dont need a Ph.D."" he tells us early on ""to realize that I overcompensate for my height."" Nor do you need one to realize that Roger Norways leading corporate headhunter and an avocational art thief is over his head when his heist of a priceless Rubens goes fearfully wrong. ""Headhunters"" in Norwegian with English subtitles was directed by Morten Tyldum and was based on a novel by the Norwegian crime writer Jo Nesbo. A transgenre thriller that glides effortlessly from crisp social commentary through off-kilter comedy to paranoid terror its on my short list of the most enjoyable movies in recent memory. ENLARGE Aksel Hennie in Headhunters. Magnet Releasing The enjoyment starts with the cast. Aksel Hennies fair complexion and his open face with its finely chiseled yet mobile features give Roger an air of amused expectancy that slowly turns into a taut stare of terror. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is fiercely focused as a former commando and would-be CEO Clas Greven who knows more than a model executive should about the dark arts of corporate espionage and GPS tracking. Between them stands--or towers--Synnove Macody Lund as the aptly named Diana Rogers goddess of a spouse who might be relegated to the status of decoration in a lesser film. In this one its affecting for us and revelatory for Roger when she asks him toward the end ""Who do you think I am?"" GPS technology is pivotal to what is essentially a trackdown plot. In that sense ""Headhunters"" is a digital update of Francis Ford Coppolas 1974 classic ""The Conversation"" with Rogers head--whats on it rather than whats in it--as an analog to the apartment that Gene Hackmans surveillance expert tears apart in a frantic attempt to find a bug. The intricacies of the book as adapted by Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryberg track lucidly enough with Roger going through all sorts of hell for reasons he cant comprehend. Still there comes a point when the movie must be taken at its word that everything is working out as its supposed to. Character development is essential to effective drama and this reluctant hero a late arrival to the realm of deadly weapons develops impressively. From the standpoint of craftsmanship the most impressive development is the directors gift for negotiating changes of tone with perfect aplomb. ""Headhunters"" is smart funny scary and surprising so its hardly any wonder that an American version is in the works. The big question is whether the remake can measure up. Bernie Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) is a small town mortician who befriends wealthy widow Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine) but when its discovered Marjorie is dead Bernie is charged with her murder. Watch a clip from ""Bernie."" Video courtesy of Millennium Entertainment. Movies can teach you the damnedest things. In Richard Linklaters ""Bernie"" the title character an assistant funeral director played by Jack Black explains the concept of lip drift. Its when a corpses sealed lips come apart in what seems to be a smile. Lip drift is bad--""You cannot have grief tragically becoming comedy"" Bernie notes--so the solution is to reseal the lips with superglue. The movie itself a partly true and cheerfully embellished account of a Texas murder case presents a case of narrative drift. Its when the story is taken over by townspeople talking about it. This is neither bad nor accidental but a deliberate structural choice with an unintended consequence--the picturesque locals become more entertaining than Bernie himself. ENLARGE Jack Black in Bernie Millennium Entertainment The real-life character Bernie Tiede was one of the most beloved residents of Carthage a tiny town in rural East Texas. His belovedness diminished little if at all after the discovery in the late 1990s that he had murdered his constant companion a wealthy and notoriously sour-souled widow named Marjorie Nugent. (Mr. Tiede is currently serving a life sentence and will be eligible for parole in 2027.) The fictional Bernie is a comic character fey and prim for whom grief is a funeral-parlor abstraction. Mr. Black plays him with restraint apart from brief spasms of self-enchantment and has great fun in the process. (One of the best of Bernies bits is his rendition of ""76 Trombones"" in an amateur production of ""The Music Man."") Shirley MacLaine however makes a remote and unfunny Marjorie. Here again her taciturn characterization is clearly a choice just not an interesting one. Matthew McConaugheys district attorney Danny Buck Davidson flirts with self-parody but mostly resists the flirtation. Where the movie is at its best is in the comically laconic straight-to-the-camera remarks offered by Carthages residents. (Theyre played by a mix of local actors and real townspeople doing partially scripted versions of themselves.) Mr. Linklater is no stranger to such techniques. Ever since his 1991 ""Slacker"" he has enjoyed meandering down twisted paths with characters encountered or invented along the way. But this element of ""Bernie"" isnt so much a meander as a pungent meditation on the hero and the importance of being nice. Its the lean steak that sells the stylized sizzle. Sounds of My Voice The film ""Sound of My Voice"" follows two documentary filmmakers as they investigate a cult leader who claims to have traveled back from the future. Watch a clip from ""Sound of My Voice."" Video courtesy of Fox Searchlight. Less than a year ago Brit Marling made an indelible impression as the star of ""Another Earth"" a small-scale drama with an eerie sci-fi dimension that she wrote with the director Mike Cahill. Now shes back as the star and co-writer--with first-time director Zal Batmanglij--of a smaller-scale drama with an intentionally creepy spiritual dimension. Smaller overstates the scale. ""Sound of My Voice"" is a chamber piece shot digitally on a frayed shoestring with Ms. Marling as Maggie an enigmatic beauty who could be as she claims a time-traveler from the future or is less mysteriously the cynical priestess of a crackpot cult in the San Fernando Valley. The film is thin and mannered even though many of the mannerisms are intrinsic to its shrewd vision of cult behavior. Theres no arguing though--and who would want to?--Ms. Marlings extraordinary gift for taking the camera and weaving a spell. ENLARGE Christopher Denham and Brit Marling in Sound of My Voice. Fox Searchlight If Maggie is a fraud shes an alluring fraud. If shes a drop-in from 2054 shes as remarkable for her anger and truculence as she is for her blissed-out empathy. One of the highlights of ""Another Earth"" was a scene in which Ms. Marlings Rhoda a former student with a heavy cargo of guilt tells a mesmerizing story about a Russian cosmonaut. The strongest sequence here has Maggie attacking berating breaking down and finally breaking through to Peter (Christopher Denham) an unpleasant documentary filmmaker who has infiltrated Maggies inner circle in order to expose it. ""Sound of My Voice"" has other strengths that speak well for the people who made it warm and intimate cinematography by Rachel Morrison; evocative music by the directors brother Rostam Batmanglij and the resourceful work of the director who isnt from the future but has a future thats conspicuously bright. The Five-Year Engagement Jason Segel and Emily Blunt star in the comedy ""The Five Year Engagement"" about a couples long journey to get down the isle. Watch a clip from ""The Five Year Engagement."" Video courtesy of Universal Pictures. Sometime around what I guessed to be the one-hour mark in ""The Five-Year Engagement"" I checked my watch and honestly thought the battery had given out. Five years doesnt begin to tell the interminable tale. This mirthless romcom from the Judd Apatow laugh factory stars Jason Segel and Emily Blunt as Tom and Violet a couple who you guessed it keep failing to tie the knot. (Mr. Segel wrote the script with the director Nicholas Stoller.) Tom is a San Francisco sous chef who cant assert himself. Violet goes off to Michigan to pursue a job in academic psychology. He pursues her keeps trying to please her and finally finds his anger. I found mine long before he did. Whatever tied these two excellent performers to such a dim script? The question is rhetorical the answer is hope and contracts. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Happy Happy (2011) This casually daring debut feature by the Norwegian director Anne Sewitsky had a theatrical run in a handful of U.S. theaters seven months ago but memories are short and the run was shorter. The movie mixes and purposely mismatches light and dark moods to tell the story of Kaja a rural wife and mother looking for happiness in the wrong places and finally in the right one. Vulnerable in ways we can only intuit at first Kaja is played with unsettling good cheer by Agnes Kittelsen. Joachim Rafaelsen is Eirik her prickly husband. The script was written by Ragnhild Tronvoll. The School of Rock (2003) Jack Black found his mojo in a movie that gives the lie to Norma Desmonds deathless remark about the pictures having gotten small. This joyous farce is a big deal and its star is nothing less than majestic as a scruffy irreverent rocker passing himself off as a pedagogue in a private school. Mike Whites dazzling script and Richard Linklaters ebullient direction are fully equal to the challenge of morphing Mr. Blacks Dewey Finn from a dissolute mooch into a madcap Mr. Chips who turns a bunch of rigid preteens into a rock band for the ages. The Muppets (2011) Jason Segel was a co-star (with Amy Adams and Chris Cooper) and the co-writer (with Nicholas Stoller) of this endearing revival of the Muppet mythos. But why you may ask am I recommending a movie that was hugely successful last year and has not been forgotten in the interim? Because it allows me to make amends for not running a review. In advance of last years opening a devoted Disney publicist kept telling me ""The Muppets"" was really good and I would like it. She was right of course but I was dubious and managed to miss all the screenings. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com 2 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

The giggles start coming right at the get-go when Jack Black as the fiercely committed but less than inspired rock-and-roller Dewey Finn howls his way through a song then hurls himself shirtless and triumphant into the mosh pit... where the horrified crowd declines to catch him.It takes much more than the worlds indifference to dampen Deweys passion. ""I serve society by rocking"" this unreconstructed slacker announces--shortly before hes dumped by his band. Meanwhile his nerdy substitute-teacher roommate Ned (screenwriter Mike White) egged on by his nagging girlfriend (Sarah Silverman) threatens to evict him unless he forks over the rent. Desperate for cash he steals Neds name and his gig subbing at a prestigious prep school where he instructs his startled students to take recess all day. But when he discovers the kids have musical skills his great idea is born hell turn the uptight preppy grinds into a down-and-dirty rock-and-roll band.Richard Linklater director of ""Slacker"" and ""Before Sunrise"" is not a filmmaker youd expect to be making a studio movie that sounds on paper as formulaic as ""The Bad News Bears."" But ""Bad News Bears"" lets not forget was a terrific formula movie and so is ""School of Rock."" Linklater was an inspired choice on the part of producer Scott Rudin for hes naturally resistant to cutesiness and sentimentality and his comic timing proves pitch perfect. If this is ""selling out"" it should happen more often. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The casting of the kids is spot on from the prissy grade-grubber (Miranda Cosgrove) who becomes the bands super-efficient manager (having rejected the assignment of ""groupie"") to the painfully uncool piano-playing Chinese-American kid (Robert Tsai) who has no idea what his teacher means by ""sticking it to The Man."" The kids in essence play group straight man to Black and Black gives back everything hes got. Its a bravura all-stops-out inexhaustibly inventive performance. I dont know how much was improvised and how much comes from Whites sharp screenplay but Black may never again get a part that displays his mad-dog comic ferocity to such brilliant effect. He and the movie kick ass.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"School of Rock rocks. Slate Sign In Sign Up School of Rock rocks. School of Rock rocks. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 3 2003 1123 AM Reading Writing and Rocking In School of Rock Jack Black helps kids find their inner headbanger. By David Edelstein What stars Black and White and rocks all over? The new comedy School of Rock (Paramount) is uncut bliss It had me buzzing bopping up and down in my seat practically pogoing out of the theater playing air guitar. I scribbled superlatives in my notebook; I heard myself tell a colleague ""Dude that movie rocked."" I wonder now that the ecstasy has dissipated a bit (but only a bit) how a formulaic farce-heart-warmer about a fake teacher and a bunch of 10-year-olds could be such a mystical experience--one of the biggest highs Ive had at the movies in years. Advertisement It must be the confluence of three weird but mighty forces writer Mike White of Chuck amp; Buck (2000) and The Good Girl (2002); director Richard Linklater of Dazed and Confused (1993) and Before Sunrise (1995); and actor Jack Black of High Fidelity (2000) and Shallow Hal (2001). Theyre polished craftsmen all yet each in a different ways on intimate terms with his inner child--especially his naughty inner child the kind whod make a movie with a montage of frolicking kids set to the Ramones ""Bonzo Goes to Bitburg."" Black plays Dewey Finn an unemployed slacker who lives for hard-core rock n roll (""I serve society by rocking"") but cant get others to share his dream. In the first scene on stage with his band hes carried away by the emotion of the music He finishes a number and then leaps into the arms of the crowd--except the crowd gets the hell out of his way (hes a big guy) and he lands on his face hard. After this disaster his fellow musicians finally give him the heave-ho and his milquetoast roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White) a substitute teacher threatens to evict him by order of his bossy girlfriend (Sarah Silverman). Thats when Dewey takes a phone call meant for his roommate from a posh private academy called Horace Green and for 650 a week decides to pass himself off as an elementary-school teacher. At first Dewey doesnt rise to the occasion He tells the kids to shut up and go to recess. Then he wanders by a music class and realizes with a start that hes found his back-up band for an upcoming Battle of the Bands competition hes desperate to enter. School of Rock is about how Dewey takes these unformed 10-year-olds and makes them hard-core--that is hard-core minus the drugs and sex and self-abuse. He goads and exhorts them drills them in the history of metal and punk and passionately affirms their coolness. As he teaches them to ""stick it to the man"" you realize youre watching something miraculous a joyous uplifting go-for-it family picture that takes you back to the primal rock n roll impulse with its Dionysian rage. The impish Black who in real life has own his own tongue-in-cheek band Tenacious D is right on the line between mocker and rocker With those leering asymmetrical eyebrows he poised to parody (""Raise the goblet of rock"") yet he is transfigured as he sings into a heavy-metal messiah. This is a barnstorming performance as wry as Bill Murrays in Meatballs (1979) but without the protective irony He knows hes reaching out to a panoply of younger awkward selves. The school kids are all types nerdy cool bossy fat gay. But they have no sitcom glibness. As they work through their numbers they seem to be finding their inner Deweys. If youve heard Jack Black being interviewed you know that despite his outrageous onscreen persona he isnt a blowhard; in real life hes painfully tentative. And part of whats so touching about School of Rock is that its clearly from the work of shy people Its a rock-n-roll anthem for the timid. Its about kids--and grown-ups--who need to rev themselves up to transcend their own self-doubt. Rock--or dreaming about rock--is how they get out of themselves and connect with the cosmic oneness. School of Rock is totally formulaic There are stuffy killjoy parents and a stuck-up stick insect of a principal--even though shes played with delicious fidgety self-consciousness by Joan Cusack. Youve seen this Battle of the Bands climax a thousand times. But there are rare formula pictures--the bicycle movie Breaking Away (1979) was another--that seem to be arriving at the formula from the inside with a kind of naive hopefulness that seems as much a product of movie-love as it is of a desire to reach a mass audience. For all its slickness School of Rock has a lets-put-on-a-show quality that touches you in the most direct way a movie can. Its as if the filmmakers had said ""Id like to teach the world to kick butt--in perfect harmony."" David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

Starring Jack Black Joan Cusack Mike White and Sarah Silverman. Directed by Richard Linklater. (PG-13. 110 minutes.) Resting the success of a movie squarely on Jack Blacks shoulders is a risky endeavor kind of like putting a junkie in charge of your collection plate. Black (""Orange County"" ""High Fidelity"") doesnt just act in movies the portly spaz spikes them as if hes a shot of Bacardi 151 in a punch bowl -- contributing 10 or 15 minutes of manic comic energy while straight men such as John Cusack pick up the pieces and prevent an overdose. ""School of Rock"" is all Black all the time and could easily have been an exhausting mess. But the movie is coherent hilarious and surprisingly sweet -- with director Richard Linklater harnessing the actor by confining his chaos to an otherwise formulaic story. Black plays Dewey Finn who sleeps by day and rocks hard by night. The 30ish slob has failed in his efforts to become a hair-band guitar hero is several months behind on the rent and drives a pollution- spewing death-mobile of a van -- but still has a self-righteous attitude toward everyone he comes in contact with. ""I serve the society by rocking"" Finn explains to the girlfriend of his roommate when she suggests he get a real job. Finn gets kicked out of his band and through a series of coincidences ends up posing as a substitute teacher in a posh prep school. When Finn finds out that some of the kids are accomplished classical musicians he turns them into rock apostles who will help him seek revenge in a local battle of the bands. The plot points follow ""Revenge of the Nerds"" closely but theres a subversive streak in Black who is a real-life member of the humor-infused rock band Tenacious D. Black and screenwriter Mike White (who plays the pushover roommate) expertly turn the films cliches into comic opportunity. In the ""Dangerous Minds"" and ""Wildcats"" world of filmmaking screwed-up kids haze shell-shocked teachers who think about quitting before gutting out the job and earning trust. In ""School of Rock"" screwed-up Black berates the otherwise lovely children calling them names stealing their food and discouraging the learning process until they convince the slacking teacher that theyre worth his time. Its hard to come up with a more enjoyable recent movie moment than the ""School of Rock"" scene where Black explains to the uniformed class what it means to ""stick it to the man."" Despite the inevitable dorky-kids-become-cool story line the film never loses its edge -- even when the script calls for Cosbyesque exchanges between Black and the excellent group of young actors. Actress Joan Cusack contributes to the mayhem in several scenes as an uptight principal who in reality is just as crazy as her new substitute. Linklaters distinct style by contrast seems to have been sucked into the Jack Black hole which allows no other artistic vision to escape. Theres little sign of the director who made ""Waking Life"" and ""Dazed and Confused"" but Linklater still makes a significant contribution. ""School of Rock"" asks viewers to take several leaps of faith and occasionally sinks into ridiculousness but the lapses are never distracting enough to ruin the fun. -- Advisory This film contains a few scenes with adult language.

Jack Black stars in School of Rock. Big buzz is all but a lock though a mild disclaimer is in order. If you usually find Blacks oversized personality a bit too much -- remember the abrasive zeal with which he insulted John Cusacks used-record-store customers in Fidelity? -- youll be between a rock and a hard theater seat here. But what a performance. (Related item See a clip from School of Rock) More about the movie School of Rock    1/2 (out of four) Stars Jack Black Joan Cusack Mike White Sarah Silverman Miranda Cosgrove Director Richard Linklater Distributor Paramount Rating PG-13 for some rude humor and drug references Opens today nationwide Black is no Jack Sprat -- yet here he is throwing his fleshy frame into a make-or-break role that requires the rock-hopeful loser he plays to propel himself banzai-style off the stage. Unfortunately the paying customers caught in this lead-butted zeppelins flight pattern dont award points for style and fellow band members fire him. Otherwise unemployable and leeching off a pal (School scripter Mike White) whose caustic live-in girlfriend has had it Black then sails into a freak opportunity. He becomes an extended substitute teacher at New Yorks most prestigious prep school and within about two minutes he has scrapped the curriculum. In its place is the history of rock musical instruction (he needs a new backup band) and life lessons in what he calls rocks motivating credo ""Sticking it to The Man."" In the wrong hands this movie could be awful but Whites script is sharp and its director is Richard Linklater deservedly revered for his first three early-90s features Slacker Dazed and Confused and Before Sunrise. The coming attraction makes it look as if School might be pulling a cutting-edge filmmaker down to mainstream-pabulum levels but in fact Linklaters keen handling elevates the material. For one thing he avoids turning the kids into ""sitcom-cute"" wisecrackers and they end up being excellent foils for Black. At times School recalls About a Boy but with a prim heroine in need of liberation (expert Joan Cusack). It plays even more like a bent version of Meredith Willsons The Music Man for the new millennium. Slinging a line of bull but displaying genuine affection for the youngsters hes bamboozling Black suggests Prof. Harold Hill with a heavier backbeat. And thanks to one of the years most rambunctious performer turns this happy surprise just might stick it to The Rundown.

"School of Rock | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; school-of-rock ) School of Rock (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli I dont want to call Richard Linklater a ""sellout"" since thats probably as unfair as it is unkind. But The School of Rock is clearly Linklaters attempt to develop some box office clout a something he has not achieved with critically acclaimed sparsely attended features like Before Sunrise Waking Life and Tape. So like Gus Van Sant with Good Will Hunting Linklater has ventured into the mainstream. However whereas Van Sant could at least claim that Good Will Hunting was a good movie Linklater cannot make the same statement about his first mass-market suitor. The School of Rock is feel-good tripe a string of clichA(c)s lashed together by a formulaic plot that features underwritten characters and sit-com style humor. The key to the films watchability lies in your opinion of lead actor Jack Black who (depending on your view of him) either carries The School of Rock on his back or buries it under his impressive weight. Black fans will be delighted by this opportunity for him to light up the screen. His detractors will run screaming from theaters. In general I like Black as a supporting character. The School of Rock has too much of the amped-up actor. After a while his high-voltage scenery-chewing approach becomes wearisome. But theres no denying that he adds some pizzazz to the movie - a quality that is not supplied by the screenplay or Linklaters direction. Dewey Finn (Black) lives for rock n roll - not the kind of lame stuff that populates the radio airwaves these days but the classic material. Hes a walking encyclopedia of groups singers and songs. However although Dewey loves the music hes not the most adept artist and his on-stage antics often make him more of a liability than an asset. So when his bandmates fire him and his house-mate Ned (Mike White) threatens to throw him out if he cant come up with his share of the rent Dewey knows some changes have to be made. He starts by impersonating Ned to get a long-term substitute teachers job. At first Dewey doesnt know what to do with a classroom full of elementary school kids but when he discovers that several of them show signs of musical aptitude he gets an idea - transform his pupils into a group and enter them into a ""best band"" contest. Of course all of this has to be kept secret from the other kids the parents and especially Principal Mullins (Joan Cusack). Its Sister Act meets Dangerous Minds with the most galling qualities of both in bas-relief. The School of Rock doesnt have anything interesting to say or do. Its pure saccharine inspiration with occasional bursts of failed comic relief and a few exceptionally choreographed and executed rock numbers. The latter are what redeem The School of Rock to the extent that it can be saved. However where the recent The Fighting Temptations rescued us from an equally lame plot with 45 minutes of music Linklater seems to believe that his storyline and characters are worth their screen time. So with a few minor exceptions the rock doesnt start rolling until the final fifteen minutes (and one song is during the end credits). The key to a feel-good movie like this succeeding has very little to do with the overall plot which must follow certain time-honored formulas. Instead it has to do with the likeability and believability of the characters and thats where The School of Rock stumbles most obviously. Its a lot easier to swallow the kinds of mammoth plot contrivances this movie spews out if there are a few well-developed individuals hanging around. Unfortunately the kids (as cute as some of them may be) are all stereotypes. The adult supporting characters are equally poorly developed (the straight-laced principal the timid house-mate the shrewish girlfriend). And Dewey is just Jack Black with a jones for anything to do with rock. The presence of Black and Cusack in a story about music may evoke thoughts of High Fidelity but that association only makes The School of Rock seem less palatable. There are elements that keep this movie from being a complete waste of time - the musical numbers are highlights some of the kids (many of whom are non-professional actors) are cute and there are isolated moments when the dialogue grows barbs. Nevertheless my overall impression was not a positive one and its not just because I expect so much more from a filmmaker of Linklaters ability. I would have been as irritated with this movie if it was made by a first-time director. The School of Rock is made-for-TV quality and if you must see it thats the medium where it deserves to be watched.

Everything about him has always seemed a little too quick - the eyes that pop open in excitement and panic at the slightest provocation; the words tumbling out in a barrage of dude-speak. Even if you liked his performances in ""High Fidelity"" and ""Shallow Hal"" (personally I wavered between enjoyment and annoyance) it was easy to think of him as a walking cartoon actor all fake tantrums and ironic flippancy. The image of Jack Black as a tubby lightweight however falls by the wayside as you watch The School of Rock in which he reaches deep inside his riffing strutting head-banging self to give the single most joyful performance Ive seen all year. Black is still a happy geek in perpetual overdrive only now he draws on his musical skill and his hipster shamelessness to deliver the acting equivalent of a perfect power chord crunched with a demon smile. ""The School of Rock"" was made by gifted veterans of the American indie scene but its still the most unlikely great movie of the year. Directed by Richard Linklater (""Dazed and Confused"") from a screenplay by Mike White (""Chuck amp; Buck"") the film looks at a glance like ""Kindergarten Cop"" crossed with an Adam Sandler reject. Blacks Dewey Finn is a beery slacker musician of the old school. He may be barely out of his 20s but hes no whiny thrash punk. He is instead the sort of overly zealous lead guitarist who thinks hes the king of rock because he delivers caterwauling three-minute heavy metal solos followed by crashing stage dives. Fired from his band as a result of his egomaniacal grandstanding Dewey borrows the identity of his roommate a substitute teacher named Ned Schneebly (played by White) and fakes his way into his own gig as a substitute where hes faced with a class full of precocious fifth graders who wouldnt know Led Zeppelin from the Goodyear blimp. Dewey doesnt care about the job - he just needs the paycheck to cover his back rent - but hes got to do something for six hours a day. Upon learning that the kids take classical music he decides to teach them the only thing he knows how to play - and love - rock amp; roll. Right from the start the collision between teacher as slovenly aspiring rock god and uniformed students fixated on their gold stars is hilarious and weirdly resonant since whats at stake is far bigger than Deweys charade Its whether he can make the first post-rock generation feel the noise. The kids know their Christina Aguilera and Puffy even their Annie but theyve grown up in a world of technological authority; your average Deep Purple or AC/DC riff sounds as foreign to them as a druidic chant. When Dewey takes out his guitar and teaches one of the kids to play the snaky doom melody from Black Sabbaths ""Iron Man"" were seeing the juicy spectacle of vintage rock treated as if it were classical music - which in a sense it now is. Rock as Dewey explains isnt just sound; its attitude an expression of rebellion against the man. ""One rock concert"" he declares ""can change the world"" This particular attitude is so out-of-date that it marks Dewey as a relic his heart stuck like a needle on vinyl in the 60s and 70s. The beauty of it is hes a relic who believes and these kids are such straitlaced overachievers that yesterdays cornball antiestablishment message now comes full circle to meet them. Black plays Dewey as a second-rate musician whos really a world-class fan. Hes an imitator of other musicians who has absorbed their licks tics poses and vital essences so that his fearful eyes come burningly alive when he escapes into his rockin-out fantasy. Hes an air guitarist of the soul and Black makes his passion wildly infectious. When he teaches the serious-browed Zack (Joey Gaydos Jr.) how to hold his guitar in a power stance bobbing his head up and down in mock ferocity and then instructs him to ""raise your goblet of rrrrrock"" Deweys jubilance in role-playing becomes the students and ours as well. ""The School of Rock"" is so witty and touching because of its innocent perception that rock if anything now belongs in grade school - that yesterdays thunder riffs are todays kids stuff. Dewey after all is really just an overgrown kid himself. Joan Cusack is pinpoint funny as the uptight principal with a secret jones for Stevie Nicks and the kids notably the preppy drummer Freddy (Kevin Clark) the angelically business-minded Summer (Miranda Cosgrove) and Lawrence (Robert Tsai) the nerd keyboardist who learns to be cool are priceless Their adorableness isnt icky but a function of their quizzicality - their embrace of rock as an alien form that becomes their own. When they finally get up to play at the Battle of the Bands its an ecstatic scene yet you may also wipe away a tear as you realize that Dewey has become a great teacher after all and that Jack Black raising his goblet of rock now rules.

Key to tapping sleeper potential will lie in convincing auds that ""School"" isnt just a kidpic . The most conventionally tilted movie that director Richard Linklater or scenarist Mike White have been involved with ""The School of Rock"" is a genial comedy toplining Jack Black as a rock n roll lifer/loser teaching everything he knows to a classroom of 10-year-olds. Although a tad quirkier than say ""Kindergarten Cop"" or ""Daddy Day Care"" this high-concept one-gimmick pic wont automatically attract grownups. Key to tapping sleeper potential will lie in convincing teen to thirtysomething auds that ""School"" isnt just a kidpic -- and that semistar Black is reason enough to see a movie. Which in this case happens to be true. First seen annoying his blase bandmates with stadium-scale over-the-top Rock God moves and riffing Blacks Dewey Finn is the consummate stalled-adolescent headbanger. Waking up next ayem with a bad hangover combined with general damage from the prior nights stage dive/pratfall he gets a double shot of bad news. First longtime pal Ned (White) goaded by prissy g.f. Patty (Sarah Silverman) demands Deweys rent must be paid -- even if it means latter must get actual gainful employment. (Balking Dewey protests ""I serve society by rocking"") Second everyone else in Dewey-founded Loverboy-type hard-rock unit No Vacancy has just voted him out of the band. Thus desperation drives protag to pretend he is respected substitute teacher Ned when he happens to answer a call to Ned from Manhattans most prestigious private prep school Horace Green Elementary. Showing up in his roadie van and some scraped-together ""real world"" clothes Dewey barely manages to fool principal Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack) then tells his classroom of junior overachievers to take an all-day recess. After a few days of this the students are restless. Fortunately Dewey discovers many of them already play in the school band deciding on the spot to turn their M.I.A. curriculum into one long rehearsal. His goal To use the kids as his backing unit in an upcoming Battle of the Bands contest. This plan rolls with credulity-straining ease as several students switch from classical to electric musicianship while others are ""assigned"" roles as backup singers tech crew stylist even groupie. The most type-A child in the bunch (Miranda Cosgrove) is fittingly appointed band manager. Temporary disaster strikes when Patty and Ned expose Deweys ruse just as a nighttime meeting with persnickety parents is going south. But the kids use their ingenuity to get themselves and their teacher to the battle just in time where of course they wow a jaded crowd. Linklater and White avoid opportunities for excess cuteness generally letting adults get the laughs while allowing the juveniles some quizzical dignity. White scores some felicitous moments in another of his patented pasty ubernerd roles while Cusack is very good in one of her more sizable parts of late. But the whole show is basically Blacks and while he has done variations on this ranting cartoon-rawk chubster before (not least as one half of satirical outfit Tenacious D) ""School of Rock"" is ideally suited to harness his shtick as its engine. He really can riff and shriek like every bedroom Led Zep fantasist dreams of doing. Combined with hilarious physical business and perfectly overearnest delivery of pseudocool lines like ""Let your fingers do the rocking"" he pretty much single-handedly keeps the formulaic progress funny. His performances of such originals as ""Step Off"" and ""Math Is a Wonderful Thing"" not to mention numerous classic rock staples (""Smoke on the Water"" etc.) are worth admission price in themselves. Design and tech aspects are solidly handled; natch soundtrack manages to incorporate large lineup of oldies as well as tracks actually performed by Black and junior cast members.
