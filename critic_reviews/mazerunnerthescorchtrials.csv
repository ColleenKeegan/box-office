Nowlin Duration 131 minutes Related Stories Dylan OBriens injuries shut down Maze Runner shoot Maze Runner star injured on B.C. set Well that sort of explains that. The teenager-culling continues apace in Maze Runner The Scorch Trials the sequel to the perplexing Maze Runner the latest young-adult book franchise to make it to the screen. And in many ways the two films could not be more different. The first film true to its name took place in a pastoral field called The Glade surrounded by a wall beyond which was a technologically elaborate maze full of killing machines. The true puzzle was inside the wall though. Nobody had any memories of how they got there and explanations werent forthcoming. For its body-count Maze Runner was a claustrophobic tale like an episode of the old Twilight Zone but minus an ending that explained everything (or in this case anything). And the sequel The Scorch Trials? Well now our young heroes have escaped the maze and were on more familiar ground - The Scorch a post-apocalyptic world where teenagers must die Its a ruined world where the despotic adolescent-hating villain is a respected actor whose chops are utterly wasted. No not Donald Sutherland. Thats The Hunger Games. No not Kate Winslet. Thats Divergent. The Maze Runners bete noire is Ava (Patricia Clarkson) the boss of the subtly-named paramilitary science lab WCKD pronounced like the musical. Seems theres something valuable in the blood of these divergents... er I mean... ah never mind Interestingly even as the world around our erstwhile maze-runners gets bigger their numbers get smaller such that you dont want to get too attached to them. Missing in action this time around is Will Poulter (arguably the best young actor of the original bunch). But Dylan OBrien remains as Thomas the onetime WCKD lab-worker who was consigned to the maze for undetermined reasons and who emerged as the leader of the group. Kaya Scodelarios Teresa is also one of the escapees (and thankfully more women are added to the cast making the vibe a little less weird). And Thomas Brodie-Sangsters Newt is an amiable lieutenant. Out in the devastated ""real"" world there turn out to be new and unexpected threats. Im not going to spell them out for you except that I liked them better as nasty characters in certain films by Danny Boyle. If it sounds like there isnt an original thought in The Scorch Trials scripted head youre right. But at least you wont be smacking yourself in the head trying to figure out whats going on (they STILL havent explained what the mazes were all about in the first movie). And the main narrative - Thomas Newt and the gang fighting their way across The Scorch to find a rumoured rag-tag resistance force - is handled with an energetic urgency by director Wes Ball. Theres a lot of shooting and fire-fights and military engagement in the third act and a defiant denouement that had me expecting OBrien to yell ""Wolverines"" Rest assured - and barring a post-apocalyptic performance at the box office - the table is set for more Scorching in Maze Runner 3.

Photo Credit AP / Richard Foreman Jr. advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In this sequel Thomas and his crew face new dangers outside the maze they once called home. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE The teen dystopian franchise continues to play rough and now even rougher with satisfying results. CAST Dylan OBrien Kaya Scodelario Rosa Salazar LENGTH 211 From a marketing standpoint the ""Maze Runner"" franchise is in a tough spot. The first installment released last year came late to the teen dystopia trend well after ""The Hunger Games"" was underway and just months after the very similar ""Divergent."" It also featured a male hero which suddenly seemed like a drawback at a time when women were on the rise in genres from action to comedy. Whats a guy-centric post-apocalyptic adventure series to do? The first film found an answer Play rough. ""The Maze Runner"" in which a boy named Thomas (Dylan OBrien) wakes up in a maze so massive that its other teenage inhabitants have given up hopes of escaping delivered some point-blank violence that felt a bit beyond its competitors. That lent some tension to the somewhat predictable story about a tyranny an uprising a special breed and so on. advertisement | advertise on newsday The sequel ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" plays even rougher. Now out of their maze Thomas and his crew stagger through a landscape nicknamed the Scorch where bombed-out cities drown in an endless Sahara of dust and sand. There is life out there but its mostly blood-spewing zombies. The boys (and Teresa played by Kaya Scodelario) are being chased by the nefarious WCKD -- pronounced ""wicked"" and led by Patricia Clarkson as the pragmatic Dr. Ava Paige -- as they try to locate a rebel army called The Right Arm. What makes ""The Scorch Trials"" enjoyable is the kinetic hard-hitting direction of Wes Ball (returning from the first film). The big-scale sets may be outlandish -- military compounds pristine laboratories etc. -- but the action is always plausible and often inventive as when a new friend Brenda (Rosa Salazar) takes a tumble through a sideways-toppled skyscraper or her father figure Jorge (a very good Giancarlo Esposito) blows up a sprawling makeshift palace. The story also throws some hard choices at Thomas Minho (Ki Hong Lee) Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and the other likable youngsters while the fine grown-up cast -- including Aidan Gillen Barry Pepper and Lili Taylor -- plays characters of varying degrees of trustworthiness. This series may never overtake ""The Hunger Games"" but its carving out some satisfyingly rugged territory of its own.

"Maze Runner The Scorch Trials | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; maze-runner-the-scorch-trials ) Maze Runner The Scorch Trials (United States 2015) September 18 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli In the pantheon of YA (""Young Adult"") dystopian book-turned-movie series if The Hunger Games occupies the pinnacle then The Maze Runner sits in the basement. After an encouraging and engaging first half of the first film The Maze Runner has been in free-fall and the repetitious narratively threadbare second installment puts the saga in danger of becoming an also-ran. With minimal plot development and far too much running around in dark corridors The Scorch Trials has a poor storyfiller ratio. And much of what happens is poorly thought-out. The visuals of a blasted city are impressive but hardly reason to spend 10 to sit in a theater seat and watch a bunch of underdeveloped characters get chased by zombies for an inordinate amount of time. The Scorch Trials starts where The Maze Runner ended with protagonist Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and his fellow survivors - Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and a few others - being spirited out of harms way to a secure location.  Once there they are promised a ticket to The Promised Land by site operator Janson (Aidan Gillen) - they just have to be patient and wait until things are ready. Aris Jones (Jacob Lofland) a boy who escaped from another maze is skeptical of the situation and suspicious of Janson and Thomas agrees with him. When the truth is revealed a long chase across an inhospitable desert called ""The Scorch"" ensues. Along the way Thomas and company are parted from members of their group and gain new allies (Giancarlo Espositos Jorge and Rosa Salazars Brenda) but the goal remains much the same and the movie ends without the narrative arc having advanced substantially. One might argue that this movie has been made for fans of the books although its unclear how happy lovers of James Dashners novel will be by screenwriter T.S. Nowlins re-sculpting of the story. The Scorch Trials movie differs substantially from its source material. The result represents a bloated production cluttered with protracted encounters with the zombie-like creatures afflicted by ""The Flare"". Director Wes Ball cribs freely from other better films. Although previous dystopian pictures have influenced his view of a blasted future Alien and Aliens form the spine of several obvious references. Dylan OBriens acting evidences a minimalist approach. Hes the dark brooding type. Thomas has heartthrob looks but little emotional range. The character is defined by a suspicious nature which considering the world in which he lives is understandable. Still he comes across as a cold fish and isnt as likable or sympathetic as he was in The Maze Runner. His old friends including quasi-love interest Teresa played by Kaya Scodelario arent given more than token screen time. Newcomers Giancarlo Esposito and Rosa Salazar are accorded decent exposure with the latter spending a lengthy segment paired up with OBrien (in which they are running through dark corridors while being chased by zombies). Game of Thrones Littlefinger Aidan Gillen takes the villains mantle from Patricia Clarkson although the latter pops up from time-to-time to remind us she didnt really die in the first film. The Scorch Trials is not entirely without merit. Thematically it touches on the age-old question of whether the end justifies the means. Is it reasonable to sacrifice a segment of the population to save a larger group? When do individual rights trump civil responsibility? The approach isnt balanced but at least the movie addresses these issues. Additionally the reasons underlying a surprise ""twist"" are solidly developed (although a more convincing groundwork could have been established by providing extensive flashbacks). Post-apocalyptic stories are appealing to writers and filmmakers because the richness of the basic premise and because the concept attracts both cynics (those who believe civilization is doomed) and optimists (those who believe humanity can rise from the ashes). Faults of The Maze Runner/The Scorch Trials lie more in the development of ideas than in the ideas themselves. The series world-building is inconsistent and unconvincing - impressive computer generated images and glimpses of a maverick society substituting for a meticulous construct. Its too much ""wow"" over too little substance - not uncommon but disappointing nonetheless. Add to that a story that spins its wheels and fails to justify its 128-minute running time and The Scorch Trials represents the most barren dystopian movie (YA or not) to have reached theaters in the last few years. One can only hope the release of the third Maze Runner film will justify its existence if not its length.

Andrew Parker Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 18 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 18 2015 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Wes Ball Written by T.S. Nowlin Starring Dylan OBrien Kaya Scodelario Giancarlo Esposito Classification PG Country USA Language English Exactly one year ago today - for a different publication - I filed a review of the first Maze Runner film based on James Dashners series of bestsellers about amnesic teenagers fighting to stay alive in a postapocalyptic world. It was a review of righteous anger and fervent distaste for one of the worst films I had ever seen a film so acutely unoriginal confused illogical depressing and fatalistic that I have no idea how the books became popular in the first place. I ended the review in part by saying that should there be a sequel I would refuse to watch it. The Maze Runner left a taste that bad in my mouth. Dylan OBrien and his co-stars describe the difficulties of hanging upside down for two days to film a scene in new franchise instalment Maze Runner The Scorch Trials. (Sept. 10) AP Video Video Video Dylan OBrien on the challenges of Maze Runner The Scorch Trials Daisy Ridley and John Boyega star in Star Wars The Force Awakens which comes out Dec. 18. Fall Film Preview Whats on offer this fall on the big screen Within hours of publishing online British actor Will Poulter (who played one of the first films chief villains but doesnt return for the sequel) bristled at my review so much that he actively campaigned on Twitter to find me and give me a piece of his mind. Fans of Dashner and Poulter immediately seized on the call to arms. For months I was inundated with thousands of angry tweets scornful sometimes threatening e-mails and a litany of often grammatically incorrect comments on a daily basis. Few were interested in creating a discourse about the film itself and why I might be respectfully disagreed with. Most wanted me harmed fired or ""slayed"" which I learned at 34 is something the kids use as slang these days.Three-hundred and sixty-five days later the film has been cemented as a blockbuster and I have calmed down about the situation mostly. Clearly I acquiesced and agreed to cover a sequel I vowed never to watch mostly because its for a national paper of record.To what Im sure is no ones surprise the sequel is terrible and all my original criticisms for the first film still stand but at least its a more entertaining kind of awful.Heroic Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and his fellow escapees make it out of a mysterious maze set up by a shadow company called WCKD (headed up by Patricia Clarksons ambiguously evil doctor). The purpose of the maze still makes no narrative or logical sense but returning director Wes Ball thankfully doesnt bring it up too much in favour of a mishmash of other genre tropes trucked in from better films.One of the biggest complaints I heard about my original review was that none of the first film would make sense unless I read the books and that everything would become clear by the second film. That was a lie. This film includes zombie aliens a virus of indeterminate origin cities razed to rebar dust and crumbling infrastructure and a rebel alliance that wants to overthrow the corporate overlords. All boys are soldiers. All women are objects. Adults of either gender cant be trusted.Its all nonsense and Pablum designed for the undiscerning and its impossible to invest in the characters in a world where the lucky ones die quickly and painlessly. In the right hands the material could be admirably bleak but while Ball delivers a great-looking film he never overcomes Dashners insipid storytelling and ludicrous plotting. It changes the kind of film it wants to be approximately every 20 minutes with none of the choices improving much of anything.On a thematic level it remains wholly reprehensible and a fraudulent piece of entertainment. But at least it rips off some better films (Mad Max Day of the Dead The Matrix) with a good deal of energy.If any fans want take offence you all know where to find me.

Seriously zombies? Again?""The Maze Runner"" may not have been great cinema and it may have differed in major ways from its source novel but it did have a fairly interesting premise A bunch of teens imprisoned in a glade surrounded on all sides by an ever-shifting maze crawling with monsters. How do they get out?Get out they did though and since the movie made some 340 million worldwide here comes ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" in which our young heroes return to your basic standard-issue dystopian wrecked civilization.At first they seem to be swept up by rebels who are taking them to some safe paradise but things arent what they seem so the kids break free and set off across crumbling city sets that look directly lifted from the ""Divergent"" movies seeking some refuge. And what do they immediately run into? You got it -- the walking dead. Its like they staggered right out of your television set and into this movie.So theres a lot of running around and screaming as our heroes try to avoid becoming zombies themselves. All very familiar territory. The film does have a moral quandary though. Our two leads Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) are aware that they were being used as part of an experiment meant to provide a cure for mankinds current state of zombieness. Are they being irresponsible by not cooperating with the experiment?Which is a pretty good question. Too bad its housed in such an obviously derivative film.Some good people pop up here and there in ""Scorch Trials"" -- Patricia Clarkson Lili Taylor Barry Pepper Giancarlo Esposito -- echoing the current trend of mixing respected actors into young adult franchises (Naomi Watts and Kate Winslet in ""Divergent""; Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman in ""The Hunger Games""). But they cant save the day.

Directed once again by Wes Ball and continuing to adapt James Dashners young-adult novel series ""The Scorch Trials"" is a decidedly lower-rung affair in the bottom half of the current YA glut. It lacks the characters and clean allegories of ""The Hunger Games"" series but its about on a par with the annoyingly convoluted ""Divergent"" films in its ham-fisted sloppiness. Comprised primarily of scenes where the young leads either race from or race to disaster with euphemisms and sci-fi dystopian tropes as the weak glue holding them together ""The Scorch Trials"" continues this series broken bargain-basement construction like a Russian nesting doll made of layer upon layer of sci-fi cliches and meaningless revelations that as theyre prised apart get more and more tiresome until they ultimately reveal nothing at the core of it all. Also Read Dylan OBrien Kurt Russell in Talks to Join Mark Wahlberg in Deepwater Horizon Our hero just as in the first film is the confused nearly charisma-less Thomas (Dylan OBrien) who survived the FX-heavy trials and tribulations of ""The Maze Runner."" In that first entry the cruel corporation thats governing the globe after yet another world-ending apocalypse had awful ends-justifies-the-means plans for Thomas and the other teens they were putting through the wringer literally and metaphorically in the monster-filled mazes that gave the first film their name. Theyve escaped the bad guys of the first film ... or have they? Technocrat Jansen (Aidan Gillen of ""The Wire"" and ""Game of Thrones"") insists theyre safe as he locks the teen heroes in yet another of the films brutalist concrete bunkers but hes probably lying as hes played by Aidan Gillen. Also Read Christopher Walken Giancarlo Esposito Join Jon Favreaus Jungle Book Thats the biggest problem with the script for ""The Scorch Trials"" with T. S. Nowlin adapting Dashners novel The reversals and revelations feel unearned present to drive the plot along and not springing from character. What does it matter if someone whos ostensibly on the side of the heroes then betrays them if we have no idea of why or what that decision cost them? Dashners books only seem to work as long as the characters -- and the readers-slash-viewers -- are moving ahead too swiftly to stop take a breath and ask any questions about the films world and ways. Also Read Scott Speedman Thriller October Gale Lands at IFC Films 20th Century Fox The supporting cast of adult actors is loaded with talents who assuredly have better (but not more profitable) things to do Gillen roars hammy dialogue with relish as he delivers the exposition of the film; Patricia Clarkson is a sad mad scientist; Giancarlo Esposito plays a raggedy-man survivor in the blasted dunes of ""the scorch"" and Alan Tudyk squints through his guyliner as a vice-peddler in exile. As for the teen actors OBrien is lightly charming but hes also hampered by playing one of those chosen-one wonder-kids that are central to stories like this. Plus hes hampered by amnesia Hes constantly being told hes the key to all of the conflict but he has no idea why and we have to keep him company as he finds out. Also Read Mads Mikkelsen Alan Tudyk Join Star Wars Rogue One; First Photo Revealed Production designer Daniel T. Dorrance and the rest of the visual team create a world thats numbingly generic Scorched wastes from ""Mad Max"" zippy zombie-like virus victims from ""28 Days Later"" a James Cameron two-fer of both ominous helicopters and monsters being incubated in high-tech test tubes. Dashner may have tapped into the essential themes of current teen-pocalypse literature -- corporations and grown-ups are bad the worlds screwed we the young people can set the broken world right -- but theres no flare of strangeness or freshness here just a pile of images and ideas stolen from smarter peoples second-hand bin banged into each other for a numbingly dull 132 minutes. One of the most tedious apocalypses to come down the chute in recent years this series gets lamer and lazier with each entry. The only Trial offered by this film is the ordeal of watching it.

"Review Maze Runner The Scorch Trials is a wicked good game - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Maze Runner The Scorch Trials is a wicked good game Maze Runner The Scorch Trials is a wicked good game Richard Foreman Jr. / 20th Century Fox Dylan OBriens Thomas right leads the way in ""The Scorch Trials."" With him are from left Kaya Scodelario Ki Hong Lee and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Dylan OBriens Thomas right leads the way in ""The Scorch Trials."" With him are from left Kaya Scodelario Ki Hong Lee and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. (Richard Foreman Jr. / 20th Century Fox) Michael Sragow ""Go"" That word shouted out in triplicate or quintuplicate is the refrain and credo of director Wes Balls ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" the breathless second chapter of the rare young adult fantasy series that can stand up to ""The Hunger Games.""The first ""Maze Runner"" film was a wilderness saga refitted with robotic monsters. ""The Scorch Trials"" is a ""Mad Max"" film on foot. In last years ""Maze Runner"" our hero Thomas (Dylan OBrien) arrived with his memory wiped clean in a colony of amnesiac adolescents at a wilderness outpost called the Glade. Thomas immediately sensed something off about the Glades location next to a giant concrete maze.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; That sense is the closest Thomas comes to a superhero talent in this tough unpretentious series and he exercises it again in ""The Scorch Trials."" It starts right after the first film ends when Thomas led a few Gladers out of the maze and into a lab where they learned via video from the enigmatic Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) that the World Catastrophe Killzone Department (WCKD pronounced ""Wicked"") had been testing them to find an antidote for a global cataclysm called ""The Flare."" Maze Runner The Scorch Trials trailer Watch the trailer for ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials."" Watch the trailer for ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials."" See more videos The survivors are now hustled out of helicopters and into a subterranean bunker already filled with veterans of other mazes. There an ingratiating commander Janson (Aidan Gillen) promises they will ship out in small groups to a new home where theyll be safe from WCKDs clutches. But Aris (Jacob Lofland) who escaped from another maze soon convinces Thomas that these kids arent going anywhere except into high-tech body bags. What ensues is a prison break followed by a nonstop chase first through a devastated city and then through a desert so vast that the mountain home of a rebel army seems farther away the closer they get.Ball and T.S. Nowlin who adapted James Dashners book never overexplain anything including the teenagers status as ""immunes"" the appearance of zombie-like creatures called Cranks or the extent of WCKDs influence (""WCKD is good"" is the series most piquant catchphrase). Thomas and company must crack these mysteries on the run while gauging the value or virtue of some rococo supporting characters notably the scavenging entrepreneur Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and his resourceful ward Brenda (Rosa Salazar) who use chained Cranks as guard dogs.Thomas keeps his priorities straight by staying true to his band of younger brothers and OBrien grows into the role of leader without succumbing to bogus gravitas. Hes buoyant and urgent enough to hold his own in a cast full of scene-stealers especially Thomas Brodie-Sangsters hyper-alert Newt and Salazars sly sexy Brenda who might be a better match for Thomas than his sometime soul mate the distant and troubled Teresa (Kaya Scodelario). The Gladers esprit de corps extends to the director. Balls go-for-broke enthusiasm enlivens conventional action-movie setups. What would escape sequences do without a convenient network of air ducts? Still whenever a scene requires a precisely timed window smash or door slam Ball and his cast overcome cliches with gusto.Balls movie quotes are smart and evocative including desert horizons out of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and suspended bodies out of ""Coma."" Hes keen on visual details the ghostly swoosh of a white lab coat when air rushes in from a corridor the grotesque profiles of bodies tumbling down sandbanks.""The Scorch Trials"" cannily exploits pop mythologies of the moment. If youre up for an end-of-the-world adventure done with brio take the films own advice and ""Go""------------Maze Runner The Scorch TrialsRated PG-13 for extended sequences of sci-fi violence and action thematic elements substance use languageRunning time 2 hour 11 minutesPlaying In wide release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Aidan Gillen Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-maze-runner-scorch-trials-review-20150918-story.html,200,mazerunnerthescorchtrials6,mazerunnerthescorchtrials,latimes

Credit Richard Foreman Jr./Twentieth Century Fox Film Science doesnt yet know how many movies it will take to answer this centurys most pressing question How will attractive teenagers survive the apocalypse?""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" the second in a series about a racially diverse but otherwise interchangeable set led by a hardy hunk named Thomas (Dylan OBrien) throws us right into the action. Stiff vague bits of exposition establish that the youths had indeed been in some kind of maze. Now they are in a large industrial compound saved from a nefarious organization called WCKD by another mysterious crew led by Janson (Aidan Gillen) a transparently shady guy himself. The teenagers are among the only people left immune to a virus that turns humans into zombielike mutants that shriek like velociraptors.Thomas discovers that Janson is stringing kids up unconscious and riddled with tubes for some reason related to the virus. Thats enough info for him to grab his friends and skedaddle. Their unlikely jailbreak sends them blinking into a blasted landscape of ruined skyscrapers and giant sand dunes like some combination of Tatooine and Detroit where they hope to survive long enough to find a fabled group of resistance fighters.""The Scorch Trials"" adds nothing new to the unkillable dystopian genre but its at least less ponderous than its predecessor. The many chases and ludicrous narrow escapes offer respectable doses of adrenaline.""What do we do now?"" a weary character asks near the end. With one last rousing speech from Thomas thats obvious Make a third movie due in 2017.""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Occasional gun violence and fewer bad words than you would utter under similar duress. Maze Runner The Scorch Trials Director Wes Ball Writer T.S.

VPCKaya Scodelario (from left) Ki Hong Lee Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Dylan OBrien star in the sequel Maze Runner The Scorch Trials.(Photo Richard Foreman Jr. Twentieth Century Fox Film)A post-apocalyptic bombed-out world with zombie creatures and humanity on the brink -- been there survived that right?Somehow a completely cliched scenario totally works in Maze Runner The Scorch Trials ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) the second chapter in the movie trilogy based on James Dashners young-adult adventure series. Katniss and Tris might still be queen bees of the genre but Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and his fellow Gladers find a satisfying teen-friendly way to combine rebellion politics science and a lot of jogging for a broad audience.Director Wes Ball continues the story from the first Maze Runner which introduced Thomas and friends as a disparate group who fight their way through a Lord of the Flies social system and a dangerous giant maze to find out theyve been experimented on by the wicked bunch of scientists in WCKD.USA TODAYScorch Trials adds new elements to MazeHaving bromantic bonfires in the Glade seems like heaven however when our heroes are rescued and get a look at whats happened outside the maze walls as solar flares have annihilated Earth. By the time Scorch Trials begins though they realize theyre still in WCKD clutches.Thomas whose own history with the group is cloudy in his memories figures out theyre doing some shady stuff in their labs so he Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and the gang escape from the WCKD compound into the rust-covered cities and crazy sandstorms outside.With the bad guys -- headed up by Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) and her No. 2 Janson (Aidan Gillen) -- in hot pursuit our gang seeks out the resistance fighters of the Right Arm who in turn offer clues as to why theyre such special kids. Or at least why a bunch of scientists want to poke and prod them.OBrien Brodie-Sangster and Lee again are the best aspects of the franchise -- Maze Runner at its heart is a story of young boys having a grand adventure and the threesome has a great chemistry. OBrien also proves hes one of Hollywoods more interesting leading boy-men a mix of geeky charm and messy-haired handsomeness.USA TODAYA peek inside M. Night Shyamalans notebookGiancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad) is the best new addition to the Maze Runner world infusing the franchise with some watchable gravitas as the pirate Jorge. And while there still arent many women in key roles Rosa Salazar boosts the narrative as Brenda a mysterious character whose connection to Thomas is different than his with Teresa. Its not a love triangle per se yet still nicely complicated.Scorch Trials tosses in a little horror with people infected by the Flare a virus caused by the solar blast that makes them look like ghouls -- theyre fast and a little eerie but mainly they look like they just wandered off the set of World War Z. Also Alan Tudyk is wasted in a small role as an oddball nightclub owner or at least what stands for a nightclub at the end of the world. (Rave drugs are still very much a thing apparently.)Its hard to get a sense of geography of the place. The central ruined city could be anywhere theres a whole bunch of sand and then all of a sudden here are some really picturesque mountains that dont seem to have been affected by the doomsday scenario. When the kids were trapped in a maze it didnt matter what the outside landscape was since theirs was an intimate civilization. With the bigger sense of scale in the sequel however viewers are left wondering about the details not addressed.Its a minor quibble and one easily set aside considering that Maze Runners action suspense and twists give movie fans of all ages a chance to embrace their inner on-the-run teenager. 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1F5lbc0,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/09/17/review-maze-runner-scorch-trials/32521163/,200,mazerunnerthescorchtrials8,mazerunnerthescorchtrials,usatoday

Big ScreenMovie Reviews Beyond the maze 1 0 Run Run again By Matthew Lickona Sept. 16 2015 Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Story alerts Letter to Editor Pin it Maze Runner The Scorch Trials  The Maze Runner The Scorch Trials -- part two of Wes Balls adaptation of the hit YA trilogy -- runs and runs and ultimately stumbles on its way to part three. But first theres lots of running both from evil authority figures who want to harvest our heroes to help fight against the zombie plague and from those poor souls who have already fallen victim to the zombie plague. (Resist the temptation to count the number of times people urge each other to ""Go go go"" and ""Come on"" It will only lead to grief.) And also to a lesser extent from the past when lead runner Thomas (Dylan OBrien) worked for the bad guys. The interesting question of Part One -- is it really worth dying to know whats out there? -- gets trampled underfoot as does Part Ones whole reason for being. (What was the point of sending your best hope for survival dashing through a deadly maze full of robotic bugs again?) Instead were served up the hoary contest between the good of the many and the needs of the few muddied only slightly by the notion that anyone would do whatever they could to protect their own. (""Whose side are you on?"" asks an interrogator. ""My friends"" answers Thomas. You and everyone else kid.) The bad guys are as selectively competent as Imperial Stormtroopers -- swarming and deadly one moment bumbling and hesitant the next -- and the see-saw gets tiresome. Its nice to see actors like Alan Tudyk Patricia Clarkson and Giancarlo Esposito getting work the great piles of concrete and sand oppress as they ought and some action sequences still manage to thrill. But thats not enough to keep the silliness from showing through and definitely not enough to keep the 131-minute runtime from feeling like a bit of a...trial.

Photo 20th Century Fox MOVIE REVIEW Maze Runner The Scorch Trials Running time 131 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity action violence). In ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" selfish oldsters scheme to rob young people of their vital essence sacrificing them in the process. Its basically ""Social Security The Movie."" The kids who survived last years ""The Maze Runner"" (no mazes in this one but never mind) are now caught up in the machinations of the mysterious medical-research group called W.C.K.D. or ""wicked."" This failure of naming wit is emblematic of this earnestly dull movie as a whole We all know that when the real goons come for us theyll be calling themselves S.M.I.L.E. or N.I.C.E. Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) both escapees from the maze this time are imprisoned in an industrial site/prison called ""the Scorch"" where their friendly new master (Aidan Gillen) offers them hot meals comfy bunks and the opportunity to be strung up on racks and have their bodily fluids drained out. The adults need the kids blood because they are immune to the zombie virus that turns out to be behind the destruction of civilization. Gary Hood (from left) Kaya Scodelario Dexter Darden Dylan OBrien Ki Hong Lee Thomas Brodie-Sangster Alexander Flores and Bryce RomeroPhoto 20th Century Fox To wait a movie and a half for a big reveal and have it turn out to be a zombie plague is like waiting until March for your Christmas present and it turning out to be a three-pack of white Hanes T-shirts. At least the first movie kept you guessing about how the giant metal maze worked. The entire midsection of the sequel consists of the following Kid is chased by zombie kid whacks zombie with heavy object repeat. I guess teens love this franchise based on a series of books shamelessly engineered to rake in some ""Hunger Games"" bucks but if so the real dystopia is the one all around us in 2015 America and its a plague of boring children. Everyone speaks in strong declarative sentences and talks lovingly of lessons learned from the departed. This isnt a script its a zombie-inflected college-application essay. ""The Scorch Trials"" does feature some cool effects with skyscrapers busted-up like bags of pretzels that have been run over by a tractor. But busy though the movie is things always work out too easily for the kids which is why this action-packed movie passes as slowly as an 11th grade social-studies class. Its roughly the equal of the ""Hunger Games"" movies maybe even slightly better because it eschews the clunky satire and the campy costumes but to put the matter less kindly its roughly as bad as the ""Hunger Games"" movies.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint SLEEPING WITH OTHER PEOPLE [?][?][?]1/2 out of four stars Rated R for strong sexual content language including sexual references some drug use. Theater Lagoon. Both a bawdy comedy of intercourse and a perceptive analytic drama ""Sleeping With Other People"" is an imaginative examination of a group of New Yorkers defined by their erotic impulses and inhibitions. Sharing notes from ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" this assured project shows writer/director Leslye Headlands nuanced authorial tone splendid visual style and slick control of ensemble acting. The imaginative opening gives us Jason Sudeikis and Alison Brie meeting as young Columbia undergrads Jake and Lainey striking up a sassy conversation and removing their virginity together. Their steamy one-night stand lures both into lives of restless promiscuity. When the pair reconnect as white-collar adults in a sex addicts support group they become platonic friends. Their frank conversations baring their emotions about sex love and betrayal become confessions without penance -- and free therapy. But it doesnt cure either one of monkeying around. Feed Loader Sears magnate Julius Rosenwald with Booker T. Washington. Their bombshells make each other laugh and sob. Headlands avoidance of predictable romantic comedy tropes will do the same for discriminating viewers. Sudeikis an ""SNL"" veteran who typically plays smarmy little fellows surpasses his earlier work building a character of truthful real-life complexity. Bries Lainey is smart but confused her good-girl demeanor hiding a philandering affair with her married college beau (Adam Scott outstanding as the films one wholly unsympathetic character). There are amusing sidebar characters and ludicrous plot twists in every direction. Still Headlands main focus is following a couple of attractive people as they work to stop seeing every member of each others team as a sex object. If they pull back from that compulsion what companionship will they find? As we watch changes of conscience emerge and moral comeuppance arrive this freewheeling alternative to the standard date movie emerges as one of the years best surprises. Colin Covert MAZE RUNNER The SCORCH TRIALS [?]1/2 out of four stars Rated PG-13 for extended sequences of violence and action some thematic elements substance use and language. Hail dystopia Teen-centric survivor horror rumbles ahead like a mighty steamroller each chapter being little more than the vehicle for multiple sequels. In this second chapter brave but naive marathon sprinter Thomas (Dylan OBrien) still lacks clues about what adults control the deeply messed-up world he inhabits. No worries there are at least three or five more installments of the serial to explore that mystery. Until then there are collapsed skyscrapers to scramble through zombie-style humanoids to flee scorching desert landscapes to traverse and that vile authoritarian clique called WCKD to resist. What are they after? Its hush-hush but it looks like their CEO ""Game of Thrones "" reliably untrustworthy Aidan Gillen has a very sneaky agenda. The acting hardly rises to the level of emoji. Action overflows some of it neatly staged but none of it telling us anything beyond ""Go Go Go Run Run Run"" Stay home stay home.C.C. ROSENWALD [?][?][?]1/2 out of four stars Rated Not rated; suitable for all ages. Theater Edina. Early in the 20th century the fact that the Jim Crow South wasnt educating black children offended Chicago mogul and philanthropist Julius Rosenwald. Coming from humble German-Jewish refugee beginnings himself he decided to help. In cooperation with Booker T. Washington he funded the building of a half-dozen small rural schoolhouses. Pleased with the results he launched a program to construct more than 5000 schools for black students and called on blacks and whites to work together to contribute to their financing. Rosenwald wanted to do more than prosper as president of Sears Roebuck; he chose to pursue social justice and repair a troubled world. This uplifting documentary by Aviva Kempner (""The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg"" ""Yoo-hoo Mrs. Goldberg"") is a splendid history lesson celebrating a humanitarian too modest to seek public celebrations of his work.C.C.

There are some striking action sequences--particularly one set in the ruins of two overturned skyscrapers--but the story adapted from a young-adult novel by James Dashner falls flat whenever the characters start talking. The young leads lack charisma and the veteran supporting players (Giancarlo Esposito Patricia Clarkson Lili Taylor) seem to be phoning it in. Wes Ball directed enforcing a glum tone.

(Richard Foreman Jr. SMPSP/Twentieth Century Fox) By Michael OSullivan September 17 2015 When we last met Thomas and his teenage companions from ""The Maze Runner"" the amnesiac heroes of that dystopian thriller were being whisked away by helicopter from their mysterious confinement inside a deadly maze. As its sequel ""The Scorch Trials"" begins they are being held in another seemingly impenetrable detention facility under the supervision of a man (Aidan Gillen) who tells them that theyre on the way to a ""sanctuary"" where the folks who locked them up in the first movie will never be able to find them again. ""How does that sound? he asks with all the sincerity of a politician. Sounds fishy to me. Even if youre not familiar with the Y.A. trilogy by James Dasher on which these films are based anyone who saw the first film knows that no one in this expanding cinematic ""Maze"" universe is to be trusted. The element of suspicion will serve you well in a sequel -- gripping and well shot but overly busy and filled with betrayal -- that soon has Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and company on the lam from their saviors and dodging an obstacle course that includes a sandstorm zombielike creatures called cranks lightning distrustful rebels and a doped-up human trafficker (Alan Tudyk) who lures adolescent victims with a creepy rave. The plot of the first film was elegant in its enigmatic simplicity Escape from this prison/puzzle and discover who the wardens are. In ""Scorch"" the bad guys at least have the decency to advertise. Theyre a cabal known as the World in Catastrophe Killzone Department (pronounced ""Wicked"") even if its not always obvious who they are. As the protagonists flee from WCKD toward a group of freedom fighters known as the Right Arm ""The Scorch Trials"" moves through so many colorful crises that it feels like a series of trailers for the next chapter of ""The Hunger Games"" ""Divergent"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Mad Max."" Its exhausting yet emotionally unengaging. Directed by Wes Ball with the same brio he brought to ""The Maze Runner"" the film is not without its pleasures which come from fine performances by OBrien and a supporting cast that includes Thomas Brodie-Sangster Patricia Clarkson Giancarlo Esposito Lili Taylor and Barry Pepper. Its not a bad movie. Its like several pretty good ones. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains extended sequences of violence and action some mature thematic elements substance use and crude language. 131 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

(ScreenPlay) ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" is an action and adventure film starring Dylan OBrien Thomas Brodie-Sangster Kaya Scodelario Aidan Gillen Ki Hong Lee and Giancarlo Esposito. The film is the next edition to the series. This time the Gladers must face a group known as WCKD. Who will win and what force will be shown? This film opens on September 15 2015. (ScreenPlay) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Not bad not great. Another day in YA dys-lit paradise. As I write this its a lovely breezy sunny day so thoughts turn naturally to the latest dystopian hellhole at the movies ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials.""A year ago the inaugural ""Maze Runner"" adaptation proved a pleasantly unpleasant surprise. Director Wes Balls feature film debut delivered the first in author James Dashners trilogy (he wrote two prequels as well) with an earnest no-nonsense commitment to the protagonists waking nightmare. From last years Tribune review ""The Maze Runner works; the movie may be about confinement but it moves and Ball has a genuine career ahead of him."" I still believe that to be true though Balls workmanlike handling of the second in the trilogy ""The Scorch Trials"" proves mainly that he can keep a franchise from running completely off the rails when the tracks have been laid perilously near a swamp of ""dys-lit"" cliches.""The Scorch Trials"" opens with slow-motion shots of barbed wire. This is all you need to know. These kids are up against it. The revolution is in their hands just as it is in ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" and ""Insurgent"" and ""Allegiant"" and ""Effulgent"" and the rest. Hero-boy-man Thomas played by Dylan OBrien may be amnesiac but his addled memory recalls momentary cinematic flashes of the world he knew before being picked for heinous competitive experiments overseen by the members of WICKED an acronym for World in Catastrophe Killzone Experiment Department. The thing about this acronym of course is that anytime someone in ""The Scorch Trials"" says something like ""What do you remember about WICKED?"" you fully expect the answer to be ""Well it was a popular mediocre musical once upon a time but something in that insidious power ballad Defying Gravity led to what we now know as the end of the world."" ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" th Century Fox Jacob Lofland from left Alexander Flores and Dylan OBrien star in Wes Balls ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials."" Jacob Lofland from left Alexander Flores and Dylan OBrien star in Wes Balls ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials."" (th Century Fox) In ""The Scorch Trials"" Thomas and the gang all fleet-footed ""Gladers"" in the previous outing endure the usual allegorical hazing and sorting rituals. They also cope with the zombielike Cranks who are infected with the Flare. WICKED re-lettered ""WCKD"" for the film version seeks a cure for the Flare. Thomas et al. are confined to a military compound in an undisclosed location until their overseers put them in the field for nefarious purposes.But why wait around for life to begin and then end? They flee. Around the films midpoint along comes exactly what and who is needed an actor who can chew it up without slowing it down. All hail Giancarlo Esposito as Jorge leader of the Cranks. Later when warring factions take to the hills Barry Pepper and Lili Taylor pop up as revolutionaries simultaneously wild-eyed and sympathetic.Adapted by T.S. Nowlin the material may be cardboard but the actors do what they can. Along with OBrien the ensemble reunites Kaya Scodelario (maybe more lines next movie? Shes practically a mime here) Ki Hong Lee Thomas Brodie-Sangster Dexter Darden Alexander Flores and others from the first and fresher ""Maze Runner."" Itll be useful for all of them and director Ball to get out of this stuff after one more movie (""The Death Cure"") and into different sorts of projects.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Late in the Maze Runner sequel The Scorch Trials generic YA protagonist Thomas (Teen Wolfs Dylan OBrien) chooses to walk into a major confrontation he could have avoided. ""Why didnt you run?"" another character asks. ""Im tired of running"" Thomas growls. Its meant as a declaration of purpose a significant shift in his thinking much like the meaningful look into the camera in the final shot of The Hunger Games Catching Fire. Instead it comes across as unintentionally comic because Scorch Trials is basically Fleeing In Terror The Movie. After more than two straight hours of running and screaming screaming and running no wonder Thomas is tired. Even marathoners gotta rest sometime.The Scorch Trials which adapts the second book in James Dashners bestselling Maze Runner YA trilogy has a bad case of middle-book syndrome. It comes with a few new revelations about the dystopian future where Thomas and his friends are guinea pigs in a vast medical experiment. But they merely amount to ""everyone is out to get us"" repeated over and over with each new betrayal followed by panicked flight across the wilderness. The YA book and film dystopias of the past seven years have often been unrelentingly bleak and Maze Runner is no exception. But after an hour and a half of mechanical 10-minute action cycles that start with ""Maybe were safe now for the moment"" and end with ""Aaaah Run"" the pattern gets as wearying as the level of emotional brutality. After a point it feels like fully a quarter of the script is minor variations on ""Go go go"" and ""Faster Theyre gaining on us""Plot-wise the film takes up just moments after Maze Runner leaves off. Thomas and a few friends including token-maze-girl Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) why-isnt-he-the-protagonist badass Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and quiet Newt (Game Of Thrones Thomas Brodie-Sangster) have survived the giant death-maze experiment where the first film took place and have been spirited to safety by a sort of post-apocalyptic Navy SEAL team. Theyre deposited in a techno-fortress run by the supposedly benevolent Janson (Aidan Gillen Game Of Thrones Littlefinger who has lost any ability he ever had to convincingly project benevolence). The fortress contains dozens of survivors from other mazes whom Janson is shipping out in batches to a safer location. The irony that he literally claims theyre going away to rest and play on a nice farm somewhere wont be lost on anyone in the audience.So when a nervous survivor named Aris (Jacob Lofland) recognizes Thomas as the films protagonist and singles him out as an ally it kicks off a new wave of horrible depressing realizations about their devastated world and the ruthless people who rule it. Soon Thomas and company are trying to move fast enough to stay ahead of Janson and his people. Then theyre pursued by plague-ridden people who have degenerated into zombie-like monsters called ""cranks."" Then human pursuers come after them then cranks again and so on and so forth. At one point they even take a page from M. Night Shyamalans The Happening and try to outrun a storm. Scorch Trials feels like the movie-long chase scene of Mad Max Fury Road complete with the ragged grubbiness of the setting but on foot instead of in a ragtag flotilla of vehicles and without any of the giddy glee. At least Fury Roads War Boys were happy to be headed to Valhalla. Theres no joy in anything in the Maze Runner movies and little practical purpose. Theres just a sense that the characters are trying to postpone death for a few minutes longer.Special-effects engineer Wes Ball who made his directorial debut with The Maze Runner continues to show off his strengths with this film All these chases get redundant and exhausting but he keeps them visually kinetic and finds plenty of thrilling variations on ways to shoot running people. The chases are repetitive but intense. While the film lacks Maze Runners Terrence Malick-inspired lushness its still expensively and memorably designed. It even has its sublime moments most notably when the leader of a scavenger outpost (Breaking Bads Giancarlo Esposito) plays Patsy Clines ""Walkin After Midnight"" in full over his realms PA system as armed outsiders invade. Ball lets the sequence stretch out setting up an eerie calm before combat. Its a beautiful tension-building sequence heightened by the certain knowledge that neither the character nor the director would maintain the mood so long if the payoff wasnt going to be explosive and memorable.But Scorch Trials still feels like its wheel-spinning in a movie where virtually none of the characters have access to wheels. The useful information it conveys about the ways various baddies led by Patricia Clarkson are trying to cure the crank-creating plague could fit into a short expository speech which makes the films 131-minute runtime feel self-indulgent and bloated. Like The Maze Runner the sequel ends with a setup for the next film ""So whats your plan?"" a character asks Thomas after catastrophe and a cliffhanger. Even though Thomas doesnt offer an answer before the cut to black the line still feels like the highlight of the movie because it implies that there might be a plan someday. One that hopefully involves less running.

EntertainmentMovies Maze Runner The Scorch Trials a movie that runs out of steam Originally published September 17 2015 at 300 pm Updated September 17 2015 at 429 pm Dylan OBrien reprises his role as Thomas the leader of a band of fellow escapees in ""Maze Runner Scorch Trials."" (Richard Foreman Jr. SMPSP) Anybody who hasnt seen 2014s ""The Maze Runner"" wont have a clue as to whats going on in ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" which picks up directly from the ending of the first movie. Rated 11/2 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times A curious thing has occurred in the ""Maze Runner"" movie series. The original picture released last year devotes a great deal of its running time to developing its characters personalities and relationships. Director Wes Ball and screenwriter T.S. Nowlin adapting James Dashners 2009 young-adult sci-fi best-seller stuck fairly close to their source material as they brought the characters to life. The audience got to know the young people trapped in a mysterious glade surrounded by high walls with no exit save for the maze of the title where deadly monsters preyed on anyone trying to escape. Movie Review 1/2   Maze Runner The Scorch Trials with Dylan OBrien Kaya Scodelario Ki Hong Lee and Rosa Salazar. Directed by Wes Ball. Writted by T.S. Nowlin. 131 minutes. Rated PG-13 for extended sequences of violence and action some thematic elements substance use and language. Several theaters. For the sequel ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" Ball and Nowlin have diverged significantly from the novel that inspired the movie -- No telepathy -- and tossed all that character development aside. This time around the kids have been turned into wind-up figures whose only function -- taking the title a tad too literally -- is to RUN Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

The hero a kid named Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and his small band of fellow maze escapees are flown to a sinister military base where they quickly learn unwholesome things are being done to young folks like themselves -- things involving tubes and restraints and mad-scientist experimentation. And so they run. And run some more. They run from masked soldiers. They run from ravening zombies. They run through desolate desert landscapes. They run through the rubble of ruined cityscapes. (Dystopia Its a mess.) They run through endless corridors. So many different corridors in so many different scenes which somehow all ultimately look the same. And then the picture ends in midstride as if it were -- just as ""The Maze Runner"" does -- setting the stage for yet another sequel reportedly due out in 2017. That should be enough time to allow cast members to catch their breath before putting their running shoes back on.

But that was a simple premise If they slowed down or stopped the bus would blow up and Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock with it.As you may recall from ""The Maze Runner"" the first movie in this franchise (Ball also directed) things here arent that simple. In the first film (like all of them based on James Dashners young-adult novels) a teenager named Thomas (Dylan OBrien) found himself with other teenagers in the heart of an ever-changing maze guarded by mechanical scorpion-like creatures. No one knew why they were there and survival required a ""Lord of the Flies""-like social order.Thomas Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) along with a few others made it out alive. (Sorry if thats a spoiler but if youre checking into the second installment of a franchise you ought to know what happened in the first one.)The Gladers are in for even more trouble in ""The Scorch Trials"" the follow-up to ""Maze Runner."" (Photo Twentieth Century Fox)Little was explained in the first film and what explanations we got werent satisfying. We know that the World Catastrophe Killzone Department or WCKD was the group responsible for putting them in the maze. A plague has swept the earth turning its victims into Cranks which are basically zombies and WCKD is trying to figure out a cure.Yes WCKD. As in ""wicked."" You know really bad. Subtlety is not a strong suit here but the name is truth in advertising if nothing else. WCKD will stop at nothing to find a cure for the plague figuring the greater good is worth any cost.Thomas and Teresa and the others didnt agree. They got out of the maze at the end of the first film; now they are in a military-like compound under the command of Janson (Aidan Gillen). Teens from other mazes are there too and every day Janson calls out a few names for release a lucky few who go back to their normal lives of happy-go-lucky teen business and ...Maybe not. It wouldnt be much of a movie if Thomas didnt have to lead a big escape so he does with the assistance of Aris (Jacob Lofland) a survivor from another maze.Off they go with a vague plan to make it to the mountains and meet up with the Right Arm a rebel group fighting WCKD. But they will have to make it through the Scorch a desert that stretches on and claims many victims. As deserts do.AZCENTRALMaze Runner The Scorch Trials (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThey also have to survive run-ins with Cranks (the zombies not irritable people) and a visit to the lair of Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito channeling  Javier Bardem in ""Skyfall"") and his lieutenant Brenda (Rosa Salazar). Jorge is a businessman who likes to blast Patsy Clines ""Walkin After Midnight"" during battle (a rather inspired bit actually). Hes certainly willing to sell Thomas and the others back to WCKD if the teenagers dont have anything to offer but circumstances change and Jorge and Brenda wind up on the run along with the others.Allegiances are made promises are broken and bad guys chase good guys (more of that than anything else). Were between Olympic games so if youre desperate to see people run and jump this is something maybe. But other than the people were rooting for trying to get away for most of the movie not much happens in terms of developing the story. Its just a placeholder for the next film.Hurry up and wait did we say? How about running to stand still instead.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Review New Maze Runner runs around in circles but is still fun to watch - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview New Maze Runner runs around in circles but is still fun to watch Posted 09/16/2015 120100 AM PDTUpdated 09/16/2015 012214 PM PDTThomas (Dylan OBrien) the young protagonist of the post-apocalyptic teen action films ""The Maze Runner"" and ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" has a pathological aversion to systems of control. He and his friends discover that they have been subjects in experimental trials at the hands of WCKD the World Catastrophe Kill Zone Department. The scientific organization is searching for a cure to the ""flare"" virus that has decimated the Earths population and what they need is sweet sweet teenage blood which is immune to the virus that turns the infected into zombies. This was established in ""The Maze Runner"" and in ""Scorch Trials"" director Wes Ball puts the pedal to the floor in terms of thematics scope and bombast -- everything is faster bigger and scarier. Thomas were definitely not in the Glade anymore. Where he finds himself along with his pals who escaped from the Glade and its surrounding maze is in a helicopter touching down in a vast desert picking up almost exactly where the first film left off with a quick dream sequence to fill in the backstory. Taken to a warehouse medical facility the teens are assured that they are safe from WCKD but Thomas is not buying it especially coming from the mouth of the worlds pre-eminent smooth-talking slimeball actor Aidan Gillen who plays evil Mr. Janssen. Advertisement Like a caged rat Thomas has a preternatural tendency and ability for escape and he quickly breaks the crew out into the wasteland of The Scorch. Free of the titular maze ""Scorch Trials"" is able to do every action sequence on a larger scale but it still feels like relentless running in circles. When Thomas sighs that hes tired of running were tired too a testament to the effectiveness of the sequences. Unlike other post-apocalyptic young adult properties like ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" ""Maze Runner"" is grittier dirtier sweatier. Freed of the cold austere spaces and bunkers that mark those films out in a ""Mad Max"" type world it feels somewhat real. There are ridiculous and unnecessary monsters but the stakes are straightforward -- Thomas wants himself and his friends to be free. He runs and runs without a destination and ""Scorch Trials"" highlights the weaknesses of this idea but it seems like something a teenager would actually do. OBrien is so fully physically committed that you cant help but believe in him and hes surrounded by a winning supporting cast of young actors who are a pleasure to watch. Character actors Patricia Clarkson Giancarlo Esposito Barry Pepper and Lili Taylor playing the adults are a welcome screen presence. Wrestling with ideas about science liberty and the greater good ""Scorch Trials"" puts these issues at the forefront. When an older generation insists on feeding off the new what responsibility does the new generation have toward building a better world or saving the old one? maze runner the scorch trials   1/2Rating PG-13 for extended sequences of violence and action some thematic elements substance use and language.

Cute kids thwart postapocalyptic evil empire. Director Wes Ball (211). PG-13 violence. AMC Loews Kips Bay Regal Union Square AMC Magic Johnson Harlem others. Being the second part of a trilogy is tough. You have to advance the story and tease the next film while still convincing viewers that they arent just being milked for as many tickets plus convenience fees as can be wrung out of them. ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" does pretty well. It finishes respectably on a scale between ""Hunger Games Catching Fire"" (fizzle) and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (aces). Released from the first installments labyrinth Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and his multi-culti band of brothers and one sister are back. So is Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) the evil scientist trying to find a cure for the zombie-making virus plaguing the dystopian future. Her final solution? Drain every last fluid from the significant cohort of youths who are immune. Heres what will take us to the final film ""The Death Cure"" due in early 2017 the kids have to escape from WCKD (pronounced ""wicked"") the big pharma/government outfit that Ava works for. Then they must trek through the barren eco-disaster called ""the scorch"" and find their way to the Right Arm a resistance group working on a cure of its own. And dont forget those zombies. OBrien is the leader all kids dream of being. Ki Hong Lee and Thomas Brodie-Sangster are sidekicks with substance and (especially in Lees case) charm. Yes these ""Trials"" go on too long. But theyre never dull and the kids are always good company. Cant wait for the ""Cure."" ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.

In the case of The Scorch Trials the answer is to lose the maze keep the running drop any trace of the Lord of the Flies-inspired social tension and fill the rest in with boilerplate dystopian YA tropes and Game of Thrones cast members. Oh and add zombies. Because why not? Though the plot moves at a lively clip with some moments of genuine tension The Scorch Trials the second film based on James Dashners novels is a textbook case of diminishing returns in a young-adult franchise which start off with the familiar ideas -- young people trapped in an oppressive world -- and add in a single unique element -- the original films maze. The problem arises when the story resolves that twist and the characters (played by returning stars Dylan OBrien Ki Hong Lee and Kaya Scodelario) are forced to continue exploring the ruined world -- in this case an Earth thats been scorched by a solar flare. One of the strengths of The Maze Runner is that it -- at least in the first two acts -- didnt care all that much about the world outside the labyrinth. The maze and the boys stitched-together society were enough to tell a compelling story even if the all-boys-and-one-girl dynamic was oddly devoid of any sexuality. (The same applies for all of The Scorch Trials except for one moment.) Left without a gimmick The Scorch Trials wanders between YA cliches -- theres a Resistance but its unclear what theyre resisting -- and zombie movie tropes with the obligatory a zombie bit our friend scene. All of which would have been acceptable if the characters were given motivation beyond ""We need to go here"" and ""I need to save her."" Theres also the nagging frustration that most of the mystery at the heart of the movie could be resolved with a good honest conversation between the characters. Its enough to make you wish theyd just go back into the damn maze already.

In it a group of amnesiac young men were trapped in an enclosed glade with a mysterious and deadly maze as their sole means of escape -- an intriguing dysbropia with an existential spin. But then The Maze Runner went and did something stupid It let them escape from the maze. At the end of the film our heroes stepped out into a fiery apocalypse with futuristic soldiers and helicopters and whatnot all around the place. The stage was set for what would surely be a bunch of world-building overinsistent sequels with little of the lean charm of the original. Now the first of those sequels is here and for much of its first half The Maze Runner The Scorch Trials fulfills all of our worst fears about where this story would go (especially for those of us who havent read the original James Dashner YA novels). As the film starts our protagonist from the first film Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and his companions Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) Minho (Ki Hong Lee) Frypan (Dexter Darden) Winston (Alexander Flores) and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario the lone girl in their crew) get a brief glimpse of the wasteland that the Earth has become. Blasted cityscapes? Check. Zombies? Check. Then theyre whisked away by WCKD (World Catastrophe Killzone Department) the mysterious organization responsible for putting them in the maze in the first place. (Militaristic fascist plutocrats? Check.) Theyre housed in a massive complex where they join lots of other kids; there were apparently many different mazes. Occasionally some of the kids are rounded up by WCKD and taken away -- were not sure where to. (Human experimentation? Check.) Regardless Thomas and his pals dont want to wait to find out. They flee WCKD and head out into the Scorch the aforementioned wasteland. Its a deadly but thoroughly predictable postapocalyptic landscape The rivers have become deserts. There are crazy lightning storms. (Environmental devastation? Check.) And more zombies. Its an all-of-the-above sci-fi dystopia. Theres very little development to these characters which is probably okay for those who remember the original film well not so much for those of us who dont. OBrien who gave Thomas a likable desperation in the first film here goes a little too often to his signature move running with his arms flailing and his mouth wide open. And so The Scorch Trials starts to peter out under the weight of its meaninglessness and sheer unoriginality. But then something happens. Essentially The Scorch Trials makes up for the humdrum YApocalypse of its first half by going a little bonkers in its second. We get underground rat-eating mutant root zombies. We get Barry Pepper with a Gatling gun. We get a demented rave that would make Saturday Night Lives Stefon proud. (""This ones got green aphrodisiacs zombies on chains and Alan Tudyk in velvet."") As our heroes discover others out there in the Scorch the story loosens up and starts to have fun with admirable assists from a series of terrific character actors. So besides the aforementioned Tudyk and Pepper Giancarlo Esposito shows up as a wasteland pirate and Lili Taylor as a resistance leader. Character actors collecting paychecks in YA adaptations are nothing new; a friend once called the Harry Potter series ""a retirement plan for the Royal Shakespeare Company."" But theyre especially welcome in this case because they make up for the films thin script and the younger actors mostly anonymous performances by letting their own personas fill the void. Meanwhile director Wes Ball brings the right level of energy at least to the second half. Many of the action setpieces are derivative to be sure with echoes of everything from Transformers Dark of the Moon to Terminator Genisys but theyre effective nevertheless. And he seems to have grown as a choreographer of chaos since the first film which was often incoherent when it came to chases and fights. Now he keeps things moving without forsaking clarity which is all the more impressive given the far bigger scale of this production. The Scorch Trials isnt a particularly good movie but its just fast and nutty enough to keep you entertained.

In a 1939 short story by lifelong labyrinth aficionado Jorge Luis Borges the king of Babylonia attempts to embarrass his guest the king of the Arabs by stranding him in a convoluted maze hes constructed at his palace. Furious the Arabian king responds by sacking Babylonia riding the rival king out into the middle of the desert and leaving him to die saying ""Allow me to show you my labyrinth."" Though lacking in Borges ironic symmetry Wes Balls ""Maze Runner The Scorch Trials"" a sequel to last years YA adaptation ""The Maze Runner"" pulls the exact same switcheroo. Containing no mazes but plenty of running the film takes the originals surviving characters and drops them into the middle of an entirely different type of movie this one a desert-set zombie chase. Generally successful on its own as a strange survival-horror-action film for the pre-college set but without making much sense at all as part of a larger narrative ""The Scorch Trials"" should ensnare a solid chunk of its predecessors 340 million worldwide haul. With the all-conquering ""Hunger Games"" series nearing its final stretch fellow dystopian teenage sci-fi sagas ""Maze Runner"" and ""Divergent"" seem equally poised to succeed it but the former has one key advantage. Both series premises are asinine but ""Divergent"" is quite conscientious about thoroughly explaining its asinine premise right from the start whereas ""Maze Runner"" at least sustains a bit of curiosity by leaving its characters and its audience completely in the dark about why anything is happening and what any of it could possibly mean. (Furthermore this film makes some rather significant changes to the basic plot of James Dashners book meaning those who did read it will be almost as confused as those who did not.) ""The Scorch Trials"" picks up mere minutes after the first film ended as protagonist Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and his band of fellow teenage ""Gladers"" are transported by helicopter to a remote fortified outpost. The group -- also comprising Ki Hong Lee Dexter Darden Thomas Brodie-Sangster Alexander Flores and Kaya Scodelario as Teresa the last films lone femme -- has just escaped from a maze full of monster machines created as a test by the shadowy WCKD organization which hopes to harness their immunity to ""the flare"" a zombie-like virus that along with an actual solar flare has left the world barren and inhospitable. (Not explained in this film exactly how the previous films maze was supposed to benefit anyone. On another note likewise not mentioned in this film WCKD apparently stands for ""World Catastrophe Killzone Department"" which would be a terrible name for a government agency even if its acronym werent pronounced like ""wicked."") Now however theyre in the company of Janson (Aidan Gillen) an operative of indistinct accent who claims to be from a rival organization and theyve been united with others who escaped similar mazes. Youd think that a bunch of teenagers all of whom were recently kidnapped and stranded to fight for their lives at the behest of a sinister paramilitary organization would be at least a little suspicious of a supposedly different paramilitary operation that keeps them in close confinement and takes a handful of kids away each night for some sort of ""promotion"" never to be seen again. But the promise of hot showers and cafeteria food pacifies everyone except Thomas and Aris (Jacob Lofland) a jittery solitary type whos been at the facility longer than anyone else. After some sleuthing through airshafts the two discover that Janson is in league with WCKD head honcho Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) and the departed maze runners have been strung up in a laboratory ""Matrix""-style so WCKD can slowly drain them of their precious immunity fluids. The Gladers and Aris stage a daring jailbreak and escape into ""the Scorch"" the sun-baked desert landscape that has overtaken the worlds cities. Taking shelter from the elements in a buried shopping mall the group awaken a swarm of vicious zombies -- the film calls them ""Cranks"" though theyre in no way distinguishable from any of the other zombie hordes that have shuffled across screens over the past decade -- who give chase and manage to snag one unlucky Glader. (The septet learns the hard way that not all of them are immune to the contagion and the infected members tearful lonely suicide is the first of several surprisingly brutal moments here.) With no other option the group decides to head to the far-off mountains where a mythical resistance group called the Right Hand may or may not offer sanctuary. Even with the threat of zombies and WCKD search helicopters in hot pursuit the film starts to become a literal slog as they trudge through the desert until they stumble upon the tumbledown hideout of mincing gang boss Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and his rifle-toting surrogate daughter Brenda (Rosa Salazar). Evidently the only humans left on earth with a sense of humor the pair may be just the guides to take the group to the Right Hand or they may sell them back to WCKD for a finders fee. (Esposito is his usual charming self here while the swaggering sarcastic Salazar -- whose head-turning 2015 also includes stints in ""Insurgent"" and SXSW standout ""Night Owls"" -- almost single-handedly shakes the film out of its solemn self-seriousness.) Despite an overreliance on shaky-cam quick cuts Ball stages a number of effective sequences particularly a zombie pursuit up through a toppled skyscraper that relies more on ace production design than CGI to build believability. He also makes time for a few scenes that are so cheekily weird they may as well come from a different film. In one Jorge plays the entirety of Patsy Clines ""Walkin After Midnight"" over a loudspeaker during a firefight; in another Thomas and Brenda take some sort of hallucinogen and stumble around a decadent post-apocalyptic rave. Stranger than either of those scenes however is the fact that for an incident-packed 131-minute film ""The Scorch Trials"" offers virtually no character development and only hints of plot advancement mostly just functioning to move a group of obliquely motivated characters from one place to another without giving much clue where the whole thing is headed. The first ""Maze Runner"" managed to pilfer elements from both ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""Cube"" to build a halfway believable teenage hierarchy confronted with a mysterious yet tangible obstacle; here theres little real sense of group dynamics and the primary characters are all purely reactive simply trudging from one horror to the next waiting for someone to tell them whats going on. Of course theyll presumably get their answers when the final installment -- which has not yet been split into two parts -- arrives in 2017. But theres only so long viewers will keep scurrying around the filmmakers little maze before demanding the damn pellet already.

Christie Pebbel says March 20 2016 at 1047 pm I just wanted to clarify that its called the Right Arm (not the Right Hand) Reply Brianna says February 27 2016 at 939 pm It was said in the first movie that they were put in the glade/maze to measure their brain activity to see if they had what it takes to be the ""cure"" also the other gladers in Jansons hideout did not escape they were rescued after Thomas and his friends got out (they were the only ones to get out on their own) Reply fool says February 24 2016 at 941 pm I watched the first one in the theater and it was OK. They said the kids had to be strengthened by the maze running in order to survive the dangerous wold they now live in. After seeing the trailer for the Scorch Trials I was not impressed so I didnt see it. Sure enough today someone told me that the Scorch Trials would ""help you to understand the first one"". Having nothing better to do I watched it today-boy was that a bum steer. It turns out its all about the zombie-immunity in their bloodstream so the maze running in the first movie was a smokescreen. In reality the whole thing is a cluster-%amp;. Sorry. Reply Alicia says November 21 2015 at 421 am In the scorch trials. They are 8 who escaped but when winston died theyre only 6( minhothomasteresasiggynwet and aris). If you notice who and what happened to the child? Reply Holly says December 18 2015 at 706 am I was wondering the same thing. If you watch the trailer on YouTube (233 long) the eighth kid gets attacked instead of Newt and is pulled over the edge when theyre escaping. I thought way more people would of noticed this major mistake. Reply Brooklynn says November 7 2015 at 657 pm I will start off by saying that I am a huge fan of the Maze Runner Trilogy. I have read both the books as well as the watched both movies up to date and if I had to rate the movies out of 5 I would definitely give it 5 stars. Now you might be saying that I am biased simply because I am a fan and that I am completely wrong because the movies didnt even follow to books but heres why I would rate it 5 out of 5. Despite what many other fans believe I honestly love it when the movies are different than the books. Im not saying that the books are horrible in any way but if movies followed the plots of the books exactly up to the smallest detail then it would be well... Boring. When changes are introduced into the movies it leaves everyone in the audience hanging whereas if they were to follow every detail from the books those who have read the books already know what is going to happen and therefore they arent as surprised of course. Movies differentiate from the books because they are supposed to captivate and evoke emotion in the viewers. If you already know whats going to happen its not the same. So now that you understand why I would give this movie 5 stars you can decide for yourself whether Im crazy. The way I see it you sort of get two versions of one story. You read the books and you are shocked over the events. Then you watch the movie and you realize that its different and you can experience it all over again. I dont see why people NEED the movies to be spot on. You already know whats going to happen so let the producers spice it up for you and stop complaining. Take it from me who has read the series and absolutely loved it yet has managed to watch the movies without a complaint because I can see the positive in the adaptions. I would be bored to death if they didnt change it and there are honestly some things that I love in the movie much better than in the book. People always tend to see the negative in such movies but see it from my perspective and you might just appreciate imagination a little bit more. Reply Dylan says October 26 2015 at 1247 am So after reading both the hunger games trilogy and the first two books of the maze runner i have to say that THG at least followed some of the book for most of their films were as TMR followed the first book decently were as this sequel sucked remarkably not only did they throw the book away they didnt even answer any of the questions the first movie created. I have to say if they wouldve followed the book even a little bit this sequel wouldve been way better. they had so much potential for this movie and they just tossed it down the drain. Reply ella says October 1 2015 at 215 pm this was the worst book to movie adaption ive ever seen but i dont hate the plot line that they chose for the movie but i still like the book better. Reply Michael says September 27 2015 at 209 pm One of the worst screen adaptation of a book that Ive seen in a long time. If you want to see a movie that is loosely based off a book I still wouldnt see Scorch Trials. I expect very little when it comes to movies based off of books but I havent seen such a poor adaptation since Starship Trooper. If youre a fan of the series then you will find that T.S. Nowlin and Fox did a terrible job. It is just another attempt at capitalizing on an already successful franchise. If you want to see a movie with some action and little plot then you will enjoy Scorch Trials. Reply Eduardo Bernstein says September 22 2015 at 931 pm just watched this movie call ""The Scorch Trials "" one of the worst movie I ever see in my life. Reply Clay says September 23 2015 at 921 am Very insightful and informative comment thanks. Last on the Eduardo Lifetime Movie Rankings Reply greg skorich says September 19 2015 at 853 pm second movie in a series of three so I didnt expect much from the film but still liked it much better than the hunger games series. Reply mtswiz101 says September 20 2015 at 1206 pm Really? Imo The Hunger Games movies are way better than TMR series. The first one was a confusion of plot and the second one was just a bunch of good chase scenes. THG is more intelligent I guess. Reply Annabella says September 19 2015 at 455 pm Best movie review Ive read about The Scorch Trials. The whole time I was watching it I was thinking ""And why did they have the teenagers run the maze again?"" That major question was never answered in the movie. I read a lot of YA (young adult) books and couldnt read The Maze Runner series. No real plot. Its like they are just making random things up as they go along. Some of the actors in the movie were good. Too bad everything else was oddly random. Reply RC says September 11 2015 at 454 am What a horrible spoiler-filled review. Ill never read another review by Andrew Barker again. Reply Angel says September 10 2015 at 102 pm I just got done reading the second book a few days ago if the person who wrote the review had read it they wouldnt be nearly as confused as they are now. Im actually pretty upset at the plot though this literally throws the plot of the book to the side and they just went in any direction they seemed to deem ""better"". I know no movie adaptation is ever 100% like the book but with the changes they made it takes away a lot of powerful scenes and character development that really drew people into the book. Reply papiamar19 says September 9 2015 at 833 am I hate that critics use the words""hunger games"" every time they have to review a sci-fi movie with a young cast.. Since when Hunger games is a parameter to measure quality in movies? How much Liongaste is paying them to overrate their cash grabs? They should at least acknowledge Logan Runs or Battle Royale...if they ever bothered watching those films. TheHunger games is a mediocre movie with an overuse of a shaky cam and poor score. The first Maze runner was much better than hunger gamesalthough I doubt this sequel will surpass its predecessor.

Theyre using the Hunger Games because it was basically the only very successful YA book to movie adaptation. Battle Royale first off isnt YA. It most certainly also isnt for teens. Since the Maze Runner Divergent and The Hunger Games are all so similar in genre they are going to be compared. Deal with it. Also what? Dont get butthurt over a bad review. Its obvious that THG is superior to the Maze Runner movies. Score and all. Reply mtswiz101 says September 8 2015 at 633 pm I hate this reply system lol. Corinne Im not being paid. I just find it obsurd that someone would find this confusing blob of plot to be better than the Hunger Games. Smh. Uh actually it is superior. The ratings and box office say so. I doubt that youve attended a film school. Corinne says September 8 2015 at 617 pm how much is lionsgate paying YOU? Or Jennifer Lawrence PR team? its not superior IF you have attended film school like I have you would know. mtswiz101 says September 8 2015 at 501 pm Kirk I agree haha. Kirk says September 8 2015 at 453 pm Kawthar Bakhach Wait you think that the first movie not only was better than the first Hunger Games but the whole series? Can I have whatever youre on? Lol. Kawthar Bakhach says September 8 2015 at 344 pm personally I thought Maze Runner was WAY better executed than the Hunger Games movies. Bill B. says September 8 2015 at 956 am The first Maze Runner was decent and much better than the Divergent series but neither were exactly what one could call good films. This sounds a tad more interesting. Theres another Hunger Games? Good god will these things never stop? Reply mtswiz101 says September 8 2015 at 157 pm ....Its a trilogy you know. Youre acting like they have as much books as Harry Potter. Reply Peter says September 8 2015 at 938 am ""which has not yet been split into two parts"" And that tells me how exactly you view YA films... How cynical. Reply cadavra says September 8 2015 at 1213 pm Right because the actual splitting of one property into two movies is NOT cynical. (eyeroll) Reply cadavra says September 8 2015 at 1026 pm You wouldnt have had to explain it if you understood the concept of sarcasm. Peter says September 8 2015 at 808 pm The Maze Runner team made it pretty clear they arent splitting it into 2 parts yet they had to bring that up because they only view these movies cynically. Cant believe I had to explain that.... Marti723 says September 8 2015 at 1206 am I know this movie is gonna be the best one from the series...

TWITTER Patricia Clarkson and Dylan OaBrien return for the second installment of the dystopian franchise. Wes Balls adaptation of the first book from James Dashners Maze Runner young adult novels about a group of teens consigned to a mysterious labyrinth yielded a feature that proved it could compete for the same audience as the Hunger Games and Divergent series. The second installment which reveals some of the reasons behind the teens imprisonment lacks a similar sense of originality and urgency undercut by overly familiar characterizations and dilatory pacing. The conclusion of 2014s The Maze Runner revealed that the teenagers known as ""Gladers"" were confined to their maze by the World Catastrophe Killzone Department (WCKD) a quasi-governmental security-scientific agency tasked with eradicating a viral plague that has killed off much of the worlds population and transformed many survivors into homicidal zombielike ""Cranks."" Confronting WCKD and exposing its oppressive policies becomes the teens primary mission in The Scorch Trials but this imperative increasingly diverges from the realm of speculative fiction that forms the basis of the book series in favor of an action-adventure format that may not offer the same degree of wide appeal. Now free of their maze after suffering several significant casualties the Gladers are confronted by the widespread breakdown of social order following a series of unprecedented solar events that have overheated the Earths surface critically and decimated many terrestrial ecosystems. After unidentified soldiers evacuate them to an ominous underground paramilitary facility the teens discover that their group was only one of several subjected to the mysterious maze trials. Janson (Aidan Gillen) who appears to run the operation separates the Gladers for medical exams and debriefings aggressively interrogating Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and whisking Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) away to an unknown location. Befriending young loner Aris (Jacob Lofland) an escapee from a different maze Thomas discovers that the facility is actually a cover for WCKD and that Janson is working for WCKDs dreaded director of operations Dr. Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) conducting intrusive medical procedures on the maze survivors. Read more Summer Box-Office Flops Tomorrowland Fantastic Four Top List Rescuing Teresa from similar exploitation the Gladers evade Jansons thugs and break out of the underground bunker emerging into the devastated landscape of the Scorch a pitiless desert. Thomas plans to lead the group across the expanse and into a distant mountain range where they hope to make contact with a rebel group known as the Right Arm Camp. En route they seek shelter in an abandoned factory where theyre captured by mercenary gang leader Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and his young protege Brenda (Rosa Salazar). Jorge claims to have a contact who can provide information on the location of the Right Arms hideout but since the Gladers have nothing of value to offer him hes prepared to sell them back to Janson and WCKD instead. He quickly switches allegiances however when WCKD attacks his compound leading him to flee with Brenda Thomas and the Gladers in search of sanctuary with the Right Arm. A significant portion of The Scorch Trials is devoted to filling in the narrative gaps essential to maintaining the veil of mystery that characterized The Maze Runner and the Gladers ignorance surrounding their incarceration. Ironically as more facts emerge they tend to undermine the storyline rather than reinforce it. Going solo after serving as a co-writer on The Maze Runner T.S. Nowlin cant manage to convincingly frame the backstory concerning the catastrophic deterioration of the terrestrial environment that threatens humanitys survival. (Some type of super ozone hole or rapid deterioration of the Earths atmosphere? An unprecedented solar flare-up?) The evidence connecting that event to the development and spread of a deadly virus is so vague as to appear almost speculative. While distracting this lack of specificity doesnt hold back the plot which essentially becomes an interconnected series of chase scenes as the Gladers attempt to make their way across the Scorch evading WCKDs pursuit villainous mercenaries and various natural hazards. After solving the 3D puzzle of the maze that imprisoned them and fighting off hordes of giant deadly biomechanical spiders that guarded the labyrinth dodging Cranks and slogging across sand dunes seem fairly routine by comparison noticeably reducing tension for the Gladers while neglecting to systematically raise the stakes. Read more Star Wars The Force Awakens Named Fandangos Most Anticipated Movie of 2015 As the groups de-facto leader OBrien imbues the role of Thomas with a degree of determined stoicism that appears little evolved since the franchises first installment relying more on withholding emotion than displaying it. Janson represents the Gladers foremost threat and Gillen deceptively displays the duplicity required as a WCKD agent whos tasked with extracting information from the Gladers and preparing them for the next ominous phase of their ordeal. Controlling the ultimate fate of the maze runners Clarksons steely Ava Paige provides timely details on the reasons behind their incarceration but her antagonism remains so impersonal its almost theoretical. Cinematically Ball attempts to sustain engagement by providing each successive setting with a different combination of threats and distinctive stylistic treatment borrowing from drama thriller and horror genres. While the technique adds visual diversity its not particularly cohesive lending the sequences a distinctly episodic quality that only fitfully builds momentum an impression reinforced by sometimes-inconsistent visual effects that detract from Daniel T. Dorrances otherwise imaginative production design.
