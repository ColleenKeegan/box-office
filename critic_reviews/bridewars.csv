Genre Comedy RomanceDirector Gary WinickCast Kate Hudson Anne Hathaway Nearly 10 years ago Kate Hudson was nominated for an Oscar for her breezy utterly charismatic performance in ""Almost Famous."" Anyone want to take a bet on whether shell be nominated again in the next 10 years? Its like more and more of a long shot with each passing film. Hudson is at her most annoying in ""Bride Wars"" a glossy piece of nothing about two best friends who grow up dreaming about their fantasy weddings--only to find out theyre both booked at the Plaza on the same day. Let the mean-spirited practical jokes and hair-pulling begin This is the wrong film for the wrong times. Sure folks like to go to the cinema to escape their troubles. (Think of all the musicals and frothy comedies that were released during the Great Depression.) But in these dark economic times watching two gorgeous skinny screeching young women battle over their insanely lavish weddings--no thanks. This stuff would have seem tired and sexist 40 years ago let alone in 2009. You want to see Anne Hathaway in a worthy vehicle? Check out ""Rachel Getting Married.""

Assuming it turns out to be as popular as ""Sex and the City"" - a big assumption - ""Bride Wars"" could set the feminist movement back three decades. Even taffy-brained chick flicks like this one require at least a soupcon of reality no? But here we have Anne Hathaway as Emma a penny-pinching Manhattan schoolteacher who has managed to save for her big wedding day at the Plaza Hotel by - well pinching pennies. As presented here this wedding must surely cost more than 100000. Perhaps in these recessionary times Emma wouldnt mind sharing with the rest of the woeful world her economic acumen?Emmas nemesis and former best friend is Kate Hudsons Liv whose nuptials at the Plaza are mistakenly set by an imperious wedding planner (Candice Bergen) for the same day. Much sabotage ensues Emma anonymously sends a package of candies to Liv to fatten her out of her Vera Wang dress Liv injects orange spray into Emmas tanning lotion and so on ad stupidem.

"Bride Wars | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bride-wars ) Bride Wars (United States 2009) A movie review by James Berardinelli This movie gave me a headache. Okay maybe thats an unfair charge to lay at its feet but the fact is that when I walked into the theater I was fine and when I walked out I had a throbbing pain between my temples. And Bride Wars is the kind of motion picture to inspire such a reaction. It represents a missed opportunity on every level. As a black comedy it fails. As a satire of the bloated wedding industry it fails. As a drama about friendship triumphing over all it fails. As an affirmation that Anne Hathaways wonderful performance in Rachel Getting Married may mark a new career direction it fails. About the only area in which it succeeds is in proving that this much estrogen on display guarantees a lack of balls. Movies like Bride Wars need to have teeth in order to work. The sharper and nastier the teeth the better. Unfortunately director Gary Winick and his screenwriters rip them out as soon as they begin to develop and leave behind bleeding ulcerated gums. War of the Roses is a perfect example of the kind of no-prisoners approach that blackly comedic material of this nature demands. When its all over there needs to be carnage. War of the Roses wasnt funny in the traditional sense of the word but it was biting and effective and I have never forgotten it. Bride Wars isnt funny either but it is limp and ineffective and I probably will forget about it as soon as I finish writing this review (although it will have to be re-examined at the end of the year for possible inclusion on the Worst 10 list). Liv (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) have been best friends since grade school. They even lived together for a while. They also share the same dream of being married at the Plaza in June. This fantasy is more important to them than all other considerations including their friendship and whether theyre actually marrying the right guys. And when a famous wedding planner (Candice Bergen) screws up the dates and schedules their ceremonies and receptions at the same time with no possibility of re-scheduling (since the Plaza is conveniently booked for the next three years) Liv and Emma get into an argument about which one of them is going to give up her dream and change the venue. When both remain stubborn a war begins with skirmishes that include a false pregnancy rumor an orange-tinted spray-on tan blue hair and other assorted cattiness. The film wanting to be seen as more than a comedy sets up trite little character arcs for the two protagonists. Liv is set up as the domineering one - a woman so sure of herself that everyone around her is intimidated by her. As the movie progresses she learns to let go and is even shown to shed a tear. Emma on the other hand is the nice one. Shes sweet and demure but decides that this is the time to stop acting like a human doormat and show some spine. The one-liners tossed out during the heat of battle are mild enough to keep the film in PG territory which means theyre so neutered as to be uninteresting. There are a few attempts at physical comedy none of which come close enough to funny as to endanger an outbreak of laughter. The movie has been assembled with a cynical eye toward the Sex and the City crowd female friendship weddings fashion and a blatant lack of concern about real-life issues like bankrolling this sort of ceremony. It would help if there was a worthwhile story buried beneath all of this surface ornamentation but thats probably asking for too much. And the ending isnt just a cop-out its a cheat and a cop-out. Its hard to imagine that anyone could be satisfied by the way Bride Wars concludes. Based on mounting evidence one has to wonder whether Rachel Getting Married represents Anne Hathaways only three-dimensional performance. Shes not very good here and her lack of depth is expertly matched by Kate Hudson who is in full bitch mode for most of the running time. We keep expecting Candice Bergen to do something witty but she never tries. And the guys are boring and largely interchangeable. There are three of them which signals that maybe one of the brides is not with the correct groom. Some might consider that a spoiler but its telegraphed early enough in the story that only those making frequent trips to the lavatory or snack bar (both good excuses to shorten the amount of time spent actually watching the movie) will be unaware of whats going on. In short Bride Wars is a typical January movie worth ignoring in favor of staying home and watching network TV reruns. Theres more cheer to be gained from staring outside at a bleak and desolate winterscape in the twilight of a shortened day than paying good money to endure this example of cinematic offal.

Associated Press By Joe Morgenstern Updated Jan. 9 2009 1201 a.m. ET ""Bride Wars"" is nothing if not user-friendly -- whenever something is funny or meant to be the sound track signals the event with a helpfully puckish passage of plucked strings. No cues are needed to understand the plot which feels computer-generated and barely serves to sustain an hour and a half running time. Kate Hudsons Liv and Anne Hathaways Emma best friends since childhood fall into fierce rivalry after a clerical error schedules their dream weddings at the Plaza Hotel on the same day in June. If this seems like a minor glitch in the grand scheme of things rest assured that the grand scheme of things doesnt enter the picture. Nor does the fact that the Plaza has more than one ballroom. Dueling weddings is the concept and its worked out doggedly though the movie does have its moments -- most memorably the climax of Livs bachelorette party when Emma throws herself into a drunken dance-off with a frightening intensity that evokes Ms. Hathaways performance in ""Rachel Getting Married."" See a clip from the film ""Bride Wars."" Video courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox. The movie isnt meant to be frightening of course. Its meant to be a cheerful chick flick whose release date coincides almost to the day with last Januarys cheerful chick flick ""27 Dresses."" (In that one the heroine had been a bridesmaid at 27 weddings and kept the clothes to prove it. In this one Liv picks a Vera Wang gown then worries about getting too fat to wear it.) This Januarys flick which Gary Winick directed from a script by Greg DePaul Casey Wilson and June Diane Raphael is also meant to track the evolution of Liv a perfectionist lawyer into an obsessive-compulsive monster and that of Emma a self-effacing teacher into an equally appalling Bridezilla. The problem with keeping ""Bride Wars"" cheerful is the inherent nastiness of the rivalry which comes to involve outlandish sabotage at such locales as beauty parlors and a tanning salon. ""A wedding marks the first day of the rest of your life"" says a dictatorial wedding planner played by Candice Bergen. ""You have been dead until now."" Thats not quite correct. Her two crazed clients have been relatively well-adjusted until now; its wedding fever that nearly kills them. Find related television listings at LocateTV.

"Bride Wars Oh no she doesnt | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsBride Wars Oh no she doesntBride Wars follows last years 27 Dresses and Catch and Release the year before that in what has become Hollywoods annual post-Christmas assault on feminist sensibilities and simple good taste.Former best friends Liv (Kate Hudson left) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) turn battling brides in Bride Wars. Hudson also produced the movie.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 9 2009 Bride Wars (out of 4)Starring Anne Hathaway Kate Hudson Candice Bergen and Kristen Johnston. Directed by Gary Winick. At major theatres. 90 minutes. PG Bride Wars follows last years 27 Dresses and Catch and Release the year before that in what has become Hollywoods annual post-Christmas assault on feminist sensibilities and simple good taste. Each and every one of these January love jousts is dedicated to the notion that even the most sensible woman turns into a Bridezilla once an engagement ring is slipped onto her finger.Its not that these films are so terrible. They are modestly amusing enough to qualify as date movies if expectations are low and the popcorn is hot. But neither are any of them terrific.Bride Wars is a prime example of this and it has the added misfortune of seeming wholly out of touch with recessionary times. Could there be a more vulgar premise or more trivial concern than two ""best friends forever"" who are suddenly willing to scratch each others eyes out because each wants to spend a fortune on lavish weddings on the same day?Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Liv (Kate Hudson) have been BFFs since childhood which is about as long as they have been yearning to be married in June in New Yorks luxurious The Plaza Hotel. Some girls dream of forging world peace or finding a cure for cancer. Not Emma and Liv who hardly seem to care what man they land as long as his knuckles dont drag on their bridal gowns.Emma a primary school teacher with self-esteem issues has been scrimping and saving for a decade to fund her obscenely expensive nuptials. Liv a corporate lawyer with moxie and moolah to spare is simply going to write a very large cheque.A magical thing occurs that only happens in movies. Emmas beau Fletcher (Chris Pratt) and Livs boytoy Daniel (Steve Howey) both end up proposing to their gals in the same week and thus the BFFs find themselves at the desk of Manhattans top wedding planner Marion St. Claire (Candice Bergen).The officious St. Claire who also serves as the films sardonic narrator tells Emma and Liv that she can deliver them June weddings at The Plaza some three months hence. But before the bubbles have popped on the celebratory champagne events conspire to - gasp - push both weddings into one day. And so the films title becomes the premise as the BFFs morph into stop-at-nothing rivals each vowing to sabotage the others special plans. Liv is the most vocal about the fury shes about unleash ""If I were your wedding"" she tells Emma ""Id sleep with one eye open.""Hair dye is swapped a tanning bed is booby-trapped and fattening chocolates are maliciously proffered on a field of engagement that stretches across Manhattans chi-chi shops salons and dining establishments. The brides are going to keep fighting until the popcorn runs out and its time for everybody to go home. And what about the grooms? Theyre supposed to man up and shut up.Bride Wars is overlong and episodic which is what youd expect from a committee of writers and its only fitfully amusing - mainly in the scenes where bossy maid-of-honour Deb (Kristen Johnston) is pushing Emma around.Director Gary Winick has long since abandoned his cool cred from Tadpole and 13 Going on 30 and given himself over to the dark side of making glossy amusements that are about as deep as staring into a snow globe.This is also the fate of Hudson whose Oscar-nominated charm in Almost Famous seems so very long ago and who has resigned herself to endless variations of the troublesome blonde. The only difference this time is that Hudson is also the films producer which means shes now typecasting herself.Hudson is no match for Hathaway who makes the best of a badly conceived character and whose presence gives the film its only curiosity factor. Hathaway plays a wedding wrecker in another current movie Rachel Getting Married which is far better and more believable than anything on view in Bride Wars. Hathaway will likely get a Best Actress nomination later this month when the Oscar noms are announced but Bride Wars will likely do 10 times the box office of Rachel Getting Married.Such is the yin and the yang of the bride movie business and it explains why Hollywood keeps making these January assaults on romance and common sense.

They could be content with a single ceremony and Julia Roberts smile. But thats no longer enough. Last year Sarah Jessica Parker had two weddings and modeled at least half a dozen wedding gowns in Sex and the City The Movie and while we lost track of how many weddings perennial bridesmaid Katherine Heigl attended we know she had 27 Dresses. Bride Wars ups the wedding ante by double booking us with two movie stars wearing Cheshire-cat grins atop yards of white tulle and silk. Hotshot attorney Liv (Kate Hudson) and schoolteacher Emma (Anne Hathaway) have been best friends since childhood. Their shared greatest ambition is to get married at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Each has a bland boyfriend and both men propose within days of each other. They are interchangeable but for the size of the engagement rings they provide -- Livs Daniel (Steve Howey) hands over a couple of carats from Tiffanys while Emmas Fletcher (Chris Pratt) comes home with just under a carat. This means two lavish weddings to plan and the equivalent of two down payments on houses to be spent on the above. Its enough to make you -- and Liv and Emma -- squeal. A lot. (See pictures of movie costumes.) That squealing takes a distinctly shriller tone when their wedding planner -- played by Candice Bergen who has become to chick flicks what Joe Pesci is to Mafia movies only statelier and with better diction -- breaks the news to Liv and Emma that a scheduling conflict means their weddings will have to be on the same date in June. And so she suggests one of them will have to compromise and find a different venue. Needless to say maturity does not win out and the two Bridezillas turn on each other. I should admit here that my standard for wedding movies is shamefully low. Theyre like junk food if they are around Im probably going to eat them. If the filmmakers are kind enough to cut the transfat in half Ill get to feel a little less guilty about enjoying my emotional pornography. In other words if I can be made to laugh a few times and give a fig about anyone in the movie Ill embrace it at least in the heat of the Vera Wang-fueled moment. The weeks before Valentines Day are prime dumping ground for these wish-fulfillment fantasies most of which tend to be appallingly formulaic. At least and this is something to be grateful for Bride Wars deviates from the usual wedding-flick routine of maids of honor who should be the bride (or groom). And even though the catfighting goes over the top the notion that a passionate female friendship can turn ugly in a heartbeat is sadly realistic. Women friends have a sharp sense of one anothers soft underbelly and what we love about our best girlfriends can easily be turned into ammunition following a betrayal. We know how to hurt one another. In this case Emma has some buried resentments; she has long been the tender caretaker of Livs aggressive obnoxious alpha. Or as some might put it her willing doormat. Emmas fiance has a particularly cruel spin on things. In an American Idol analogy he says Liv is Simon (Cowell); Emma is peppy Paula (Abdul). ""But everyone listens to Simon"" Emma says with dismay. ""I wouldnt marry Simon"" Fletcher tells her. ""Im marrying me some Paula."" Then he licks his chops. Emma may be a Paula but in the end the movie owes its mild success to Anne Hathaway who makes it watchable. After seeing Bride Wars marketing campaign I wondered whether Hathaway would hurt her hopes of an Oscar nomination for Rachel Getting Married by appearing in such lightweight fare right around ballot time. (Rachel may get married but that film indulges no fantasies.) Instead Bride Wars is a reminder that Hathaway can be soulful and charming no matter how mundane her surroundings. She manages her appealing vulnerability with expertise but shes also learned how to blend in just enough sexuality to put those Princess Diaries days behind her. (It helps that director Gary Winick puts her in black hot pants for a dance number.) Hudson who co-produced the film fares less well. Sporting bangs so long they seem poised for an attack on the rest of her face she appears oddly aged. Her Liv has the brittle hard quality of a Kim Cattrall. Its distracting; my inner voice kept muttering ""What has Kate Hudson done with her freshness? It should not be used up at 29"" Perhaps a diet of strictly romcom fare is no healthier for movie stars than it is for audiences. Still Hudson does win the bridal wars in one sense when it comes to The Dress Livs Vera Wang definitely trumps Emmas heirloom. See the 100 best movies of all time.

Battling brides Liv (Kate Hudson left) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) have an emotional reunion at Livs wedding. Photo Claire Folger Twentieth Century Fox Movie review Bride Wars 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Bride Wars Comedy. Starring Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson. Directed by Gary Winick. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its hard to imagine a less palatable premise Two privileged young Manhattanites morph from best friends into bridezillas and tear each other apart over who gets to have the Best Wedding Ever. The concept seems dated. Throwing away hundreds of thousands of dollars on the perfect flowers and the perfect dress and the perfect save-the-date announcement is so early 2008. In these recessionary times its not just misogynistic to assume that intelligent women turn into feral dogs at the sight of a Tiffany gift box but its also beside the point. Excessive spending is as declasse as the Bush administration. And yet for all its clunky moments ""Bride Wars"" isnt a complete disaster. Anne Hathaway who plays schoolteacher Emma to Kate Hudsons power-lunching young lawyer Liv gives a parallel performance to her turn in ""The Devil Wears Prada""; both films walk the line between glorifying and satirizing the wedding and beauty industries although ""Prada"" is the more effective of the two. ""Bride Wars"" finds fertile ground to mock but spends too much time in the trenches of slapstick warfare to deliver any really stunning takedowns. As far as broad comedy goes though its no more or less silly than the latest Will Ferrell movie and delivers enough laughs to justify its more ridiculous stunts. The setup is that Emma and Liv childhood best friends from New Jersey once glimpsed a wedding at the Plaza Hotel and then spent countless hours re-creating it in Emmas attic. The question of how that fantasy managed to stay at the center of their lives through high school college graduate school and adult life in New York City is never answered; its the central weakness of the film in the same way that the refusal to consider abortion makes Judd Apatows ""Knocked Up"" difficult to swallow. As women in their late 20s Emma and Liv have maintained their close friendship (with improbably great wardrobes) but change is around the corner Both have live-in boyfriends and real jobs and friends who are getting married. The hard-charging Liv cant wait for her ring - she literally cant wait as an accidental discovery leads to an engagement party without an actual engagement - while the softer Emma is less maniacal but both are eager to jump into a new era of adulthood. Hudson who has inherited at least some of her mother Goldie Hawns great timing doesnt quite have the depth of Hathaway who has demonstrated that she can take on shallow comedic roles and intense dramatic turns with equal aplomb but she makes a credible Liv. With Cleopatra-like eye makeup and shiny blond hair Hudson certainly looks the part of a type-A achiever ready and willing to take control of a situation. Both actresses are fun to watch even in the lamest moments of their fight. Once their sugar-and-spice characters have been sketched the plot kicks in. Emma gets a surprise proposal and all of a sudden both women are marching into famous (?) wedding planner Marion St. Claires pink office to plan their nuptials. The shrieking and hugging come to an abrupt stop though when both get booked at the Plaza on the same afternoon. One of them will have to find another venue and date. The horror The film is well paced but there are a few recurring problems One nagging annoyance is the narration by Candice Bergen who plays St. Claire. She delivers great droll one-liners - stealing scenes in lowbrow comedies seems to be her niche since she appeared as a Vogue editor in the ""Sex and the City"" TV show and movie - but her halting cadence makes for cringe-worthy voice-overs. The fuzzy photo montages also need to go away. After the fur flies - lets just say a Butter-of-the-Month club a tanning salon and an extremely inappropriate wedding video are involved - the finale brings home the message that friendship trumps wedding planning. The larger issue about the meaning of impossibly lavish and obsessively planned weddings goes ignored but this film isnt trying to be a probing examination of the American female psyche. If you came to see two pretty girls in wedding dresses wrestle you wont be disappointed. The sequel is a no-brainer too After the ideal wedding comes deluxe strollers Baby Einstein and the sprawling industry of perfect parenting. ""Bride Wars"" will beget ""Baby Wars."" Maybe next time instead of fighting each other Emma and Liv can take on more worthy opponents. -- Advisory Nothing objectionable save some light cursing and a few rounds of Tequila shots.

You upon leaving Bride Wars. Thats the one with Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson as best buds turned sworn enemies when their nuptials are accidentally booked on the same day. Like moussed hair and inverted-pyramid shoulder pads this sloppy sloppy slapstick is an artifact from the 1980s when consumption was more conspicuous and wedding mags counseled the expectant Bridezilla to book her venue at least 24 months before the ceremony and her groom at least 12 months before. Do I exaggerate? Not by much. Bride Wars sags under the tonnage of product placement for the Plaza Hotel Vera Wang and Tiffany. So much so that you wonder if the hostelry couturiere and jeweler financed the film which purveys 100000 weddings 18000 bridal gowns and 30000 engagement blings. How bad can a movie be with Goldilocks Hudson and Cinderella Hathaway? So excruciating that Hudsons sunshine cant warm it and Hathaways rose redolence cant mask its stink. Its the rotten - and possibly poisoned - apple of fairy-tale movies. Other girls play soccer; young Liv and Emma play bride. Liv is the domineering one; Emma the perpetual pleaser. (In this movie with an unexamined undercurrent of same-sex love Liv always gets the dress and Emma the tuxedo.) When they grow up Liv (Hudson) is a cutthroat litigator and Emma (Hathaway) a pliant schoolteacher both awaiting proposals from live-in beaux essentially superfluous to the story. Once the rings are proffered (conveniently within 24 hours of each other) the pals see legendary wedding planner Marion St. Claire (Candice Bergen channeling Martha Stewart) who books their June weddings at the Plaza two weeks apart. An inputting error results in both being scheduled the same day. When neither yields the date battle ensues a take-no-prisoners war where the domineering one meets her match and the pleaser decides to please herself. Thus this most contrived of conflicts is spun into a ""growing experience"" where the dominator is humiliated into humility and the doormat stands up for herself by wiping her feet on others. Ordinarily actresses of great charm Hathaway and Hudson submit to the embarrassments of the script (from Greg DePaul Casey Wilson and June Diane Raphael) with visibly tense jawlines and without visible joy. I would have guessed it was impossible to rob Hudson of her effervescence Hathaway of her grace. What were the screenwriters thinking? If director Gary Winick (Tadpole Charlottes Web) finds this funny there is no evidence of it in his choppy rhythm or manhandling of actresses. Comedy requires speed and lightness of touch. Though I appreciate the diversion of looking at attractive actresses in attractive clothes (glossily photographed by Frederick Elmes) I cant imagine anyone finding Bride Wars amusing. I sincerely hope that this ill-advised affair wont undermine Anne Hathaways Oscar prospects for her other wedding movie Rachel Getting Married (as Eddie Murphys Norbit released when Academy members were filling in their ballot soured his Oscar chances for Dreamgirls). Just as I sincerely hope that Hollywood will learn that there is more to the female moviegoer - and the characters she wants to see - than a consumer of fashion and planner of weddings.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

(PG) Fox (89 min.) Directed by Gary Winick. With Anne Hathaway Kate Hudson Candice Bergen. Now playing in New Jersey. THREE STARS. Kate Hudson is pretty sharp. You might not know it from her sunny hippie-princess vibe. You certainly wouldnt guess it from her last four movies -- ""My Best Friends Girl"" ""Fools Gold"" ""You Me and Dupree"" and ""The Skeleton Key"" -- which ran the gamut from bad to worse. But -- like mom Goldie Hawn -- theres a brain behind those bangs. Hudson knows shes always been at her best -- ""Raising Helen"" ""Almost Famous"" -- when paired with a decent director and a strong cast. So for ""Bride Wars"" her first film as producer she picked up filmmaker Gary Winick and co-star Anne Hathaway. As I said pretty sharp. Winick is no genius (but then Hudson already worked with Robert Altman on ""Dr. T and the Women"" and where did that get her?) He is however a competent craftsman whose comedies -- from the indie ""Tadpole"" to the hit ""13 Going on 30"" -- are smart and slick. Hathaway meanwhile is a strong steadily surprising co-star. In a purely careerist sense this is a bit of a step back for her after ""Rachel Getting Married"" ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Becoming Jane."" But shes clearly having serious fun and she makes everybody look better. Which of course is what any smart producer/star wants. The story is slight and a little sitcom-predictable Hudson and Hathaway play two childhood BFFs raised in Jersey and living in Manhattan. Theyve taken different paths in corporate law and middle-school education (and in another wise move Hudson casts herself against type as the aggressive lawyer). But they have one huge love in common The perfect June wedding. Of course perfection in comedies exists only so some screenwriter can heave a brick through it. And so after a few twists the two pals both get engaged and begin planning their nuptials -- for the same day. And jealously start sabotaging the others event any way they can. The setup is really the movies weakest point. As hard as the team of screenwriters work its always clear that it is their work and not their characters personalities thats behind the conflict and all the resulting complications. But Winick keeps things light and moving helped by the wonderful cinematographer (and longtime David Lynch collaborator) Frederick Elmes who fills the film with marvelous almost three-dimensional still sequences. New York never looked lovelier either (although the product placement for the Plaza is exhausting). Hathaway is terrific as the vulnerable slightly submissive schoolteacher (although it would have been nice to show her inevitable transformation more fully). Hudson makes good use of the spoiled kittenish calculation that always lurked behind her daisy-fresh charm. The whole thing goes by quickly and painlessly providing a few laughs some decent lines and the requisite hard-core high-fashion details -- the sort of vicarious window-shopping that movies like this need to deliver as regularly as punch lines. All in all its a good girlfriend movie and a decent date-night picture. It wont change your life of course. But it might begin to change Hudsons career. Rating note The film contains alcohol abuse and some sensuality. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Its a minor blip on the soaring career of Anne Hathaway who should be receiving an Oscar nomination for her work in the infinitely superior marital comedy ""Rachel Getting Married"" in a couple of weeks. But its another nail in the coffin for Kate Hudson whose career has long been headed in the other direction. Looking at her rap sheet Hudson has shockingly not done a single film worth watching - and many worth actively avoiding - since she scored an Oscar nomination for ""Almost Famous"" seven long years ago. MOVIE BLOG Why Would the Weary-Looking Kate Hudson Cast Herself Opposite Anne Hathaway? MORE Two-Faced Anne Hathaway POP VIDEO QUIZ Classic Chick Flicks Ostensibly only three years older than Hathaway in real life the hard and weary Hudson looks perhaps a decade older than her fresh-faced co-star which - together with their complete lack of chemistry together - makes it hard to accept them as best friends since childhood. Not that ""Bride Wars"" is tethered to any sort of reality. Anything you need to know to avoid wasting your 12 is in the unpromising trailer. In short Liv (Hudson) and Emma (Hathaway) have fantasized about a wedding at the Plaza since they were girls. When Emmas boyfriend proposes - and Liv promptly extorts one from hers - they accidentally wind up with the same wedding date at the same place. In the real world best friends with many common pals might turn it into a joint ceremony but that would result in a movie about one-tenth the tedious 88 minutes required to play this one out to its groaningly predictable climax. Basically these women repeatedly try to sabotage each other. Liv conspires to give Emma an orange fake tan and spreads untrue rumors that shes pregnant. Emma manages to have Livs hair dyed blue inundates her with sweets so her ex-pal wont fit into her Vera Wang wedding gown and crashes Livs bachelorette party. Sounds like a riot? Ive seen funnier direct-to-video comedies. Hathaway who underplays fares better than the eyeball-rolling Hudson. Also the latters character is highly obnoxious - and Hathaway is far more believable as a meek middle-school teacher than Hudson is as a high-powered lawyer. Candice Bergen seems intensely bored as the wedding planner of both women - and she will have plenty of company in the audience. As for the bland actors stuck playing the hapless grooms well spare them further embarrassment. ""Bride Wars"" may lead future generations to believe that before the Great Recession of the early 21st century even teachers could save up for a wedding at the Plaza. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next KILLER MONKEYS Read Next KILLER MONKEYS Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 57076 How Hillary blew her big moment 25993 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 22402 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue Ex-Focus Features CEO thanks company for firing him SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(Courtesy of Fox) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday January 8 2009 324 PM Comedy about two friends who sabotage each others weddings. With Anne Hathaway Kate Hudson. Director Gary Winick (130). PG language mature themes. At area theaters. Guys wondering what we ladies are really like? Well Gary Winicks new comedy offers a handy guide to the ever-mysterious fairer sex.  We are according to ""Bride Wars"" ""obnoxious"" ""overbearing"" ""crazy"" ""pathetic"" ""bitchy"" and ""basket cases."" Then again who could blame us? Judging from this January time-waster its not easy being a woman. With jobs family and friends serving as mere inconveniences the obsessive all-consuming need for a perfect wedding is enough to make anybody -- well see above.Granted it would be depressing to think that people like this might actually exist. But its also a little depressing to think that movies like this actually exist so you can never be too sure. Though ""Wars"" is the sort of superficial fluff Kate Hudson is too often drawn to its surprising that shes joined by Anne Hathaway -- whos likely to earn an Oscar nomination for ""Rachel Getting Married"" a wedding film that is this ones opposite in every way. But here they both are as BFFs Liv (Hudson) and Emma (Hathaway). Besties since childhood they have always shared the same dream. True love? Fulfilling careers? World peace? Nope. All theyve ever really wanted are June weddings at the Plaza hotel. When they each get engaged they giggle shriek and rush off to the citys top event planner (Can-dice Bergen) who explains that the Plaza only has one date open in June. Which means the women will either have to reasonably compromise or kill each other. It took three screen-writers to decide on the latter forcing these two talented actresses to spend the rest of the movie scheming whining and at one low point actually pulling each others hair. Hudson has if nothing else traded up last winter she was stuck in ""Fools Gold"" an equally forgettable romantic comedy with a clearly bored Matthew McConaughey. This year at least shes got a willing partner in the admirably committed Hathaway. (As is usually the case in bridal movies the grooms -- played blandly by Chris Pratt and Steve Howey - hover on the sidelines fully aware of their own insignificance.) If flipping through ""Brides"" magazine is your kind of guilty pleasure you might enjoy the Vera Wang dresses the Bloomies registry the Tiffany rings. But ironically enough you may find your platinum dreams looking a little tarnished through Winicks eyes. His movie doesnt make a very strong case for either womanhood or weddings but you wont find a better pitch for a good old-fashioned elopement.

It isnt good either. Its apathy incarnate. Its the Bride of Floppenstein a C-minus a soggy sad thing floating in a lukewarm limbo of sentimental mediocrity. If you removed the scripts cliches and platitudes the film would contract to the length of a preview trailer. This is the sort of womens comedy that is photographed to look like pages from a glossy lifestyle magazine and presents catty quips as if expressions of sublimated hostility were pearls of wit. Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson play lifelong friends who have always shared a dream of an elegant June wedding at New York Citys Plaza Hotel. Hathaway grows up to become a congenitally people-pleasing grade school teacher and Hudson becomes a barracuda lawyer. They become mortal enemies when the events are booked on the same day making them rivals for services venues and guests. The story is haphazard but once youre past the title sequence certain developments are a given. You know that sabotage will be planned hair will be pulled and the pair will do lots of hugging and learning in the last reel. These are not spoilers. There is no novelty here to be protected. You do not expect films such as this to mine rich new seams of creative material. But is an occasional surprise too much to ask? Evidently so. The best-case scenario would be Hathaway setting the bar of performance high and Hudson stretching to reach her co-stars level of professionalism. You guessed it Hathaway stoops to the level of Hudson who would probably be a squinty blonde office temp if she werent the daughter of Goldie Hawn. Hudsons face is so inexpressive she looks like the victim of a drive-by Botoxing and she swallows her lines in a rolling mumble. Hudson usually coasts on her innate adorability but here shes playing a hard-edged career woman and without perky cuteness shes got nothin. BRIDE WARS  out of 4 stars Rating PG for suggestive content language and some rude behavior. Hathaway has a smile you can hardly help returning though here she uses it to indicate punch lines. Thats rather bush-league but we would probably miss the low-wattage jokes unless she pointed them out. Candice Bergen is on hand as a ritzy dragon lady wedding planner a faint echo of Meryl Streeps razor-tongued magazine editor in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and Kristen Johnston (from TVs ""Third Rock From the Sun"") dithers as Hathaways frenemy co-worker. You get the feeling that they werent anyones first choice for those roles but then again its hard to imagine ""Bride Wars"" being any actress first choice either.

"Bride Wars (PG)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Bride Wars (PG)  If anyone asks you if you want to see Bride Wars remember the right answer I dont. The ""bride wars"" between Liv (Kate Hudson left) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) come to a memorable conclusion at Livs wedding in 20th Century Foxs ""Bride Wars."" Photo Claire Folger/20th Century Fox/MCT. Share Print Save to your profile Connie Ogle The Miami Herald Every bit as idiotic as its trailer indicated it would be Bride Wars is an insipid comedy in which the women are shallow acquisitive backstabbing selfish harridans and the men who agree to marry them are blank slates who exist solely to provide Tiffany boxes and the merchandise inside. If nothing else the guys will make you appreciate Sex and the Citys Big who at least had a personality to go with his jewelry-purchasing function. Women have been a box-office force ever since The Devil Wears Prada was released in 2006 and Sex and the City and Mamma Mia have confirmed the happy tradition. But are we dumb or desperate enough to fall for the calculated vapidness of Bride Wars which centers on Jersey girls Emma (Anne Hathaway who is far too talented for this sort of drivel) and Liv (Kate Hudson who is not)? The best friends have dreamed of their wedding days since they were embryos. Emma is the good girl a middle-school teacher who tries to please everyone. Liv is a successful well-paid attorney touted for her tough negotiating skills. (Dont worry sexists youll get your desserts; shell melt down soon enough under all the pressure of planning a wedding. Just as women are wont to do.) The casting of Hudson as a brilliant legal mind may well be the funniest bit in the movie especially considering that these grown women screaming at the sight of a Tiffany box make Carrie Bradshaw seem as intelligent and restrained as Susan Sontag. The friendship swiftly unravels though when a snafu leaves the women with the same wedding date at the same venue. And so these maids without honor turn on each other. Bride Wars is equipped with all the traditional wedding elements something old (Candice Bergen in her tiresome recurring role as a y yet stylish matron this time a swanky wedding planner); something new (brides-to-be who think they can book The Plaza a mere three months in advance); something borrowed (just about every gag) and something blue (you after paying to see it). Unfortunately nobody thought to include any funny stuff. Gary Winick who directed the delightful Jennifer Garner comedy 13 Going on 30 and his merry band of screenwriters were clearly reduced to rummaging through old sitcoms for jokes as Emma and Liv try to sabotage each others nuptials. The result involves such pithy commentary as Your wedding can suck it and one far-from-riotous case of blue hair. Even Made of Honor didnt stoop this low. The irony of course is that Hathaways last film was the terrific Rachel Getting Married in which she played a drug addict out of rehab for her sisters wedding. Hathaway is getting well-deserved Oscar buzz for her powerhouse performance and its a testament to how fine she is that she doesnt squander any good will by marrying herself to this disaster. She at least comes out of this mess with her dignity intact. But if anyone asks you if you want to see Bride Wars remember the right answer I dont. Cast Kate Hudson Anne Hathaway Candice Bergen.

Murphy Brown would have little sympathy for the belittling battle that best friends Liv (Hudson) and tagwedding dramedy Emma (Hathaway) dive into once their exclusive wedding planner books their nuptials for the same day at the same dreamed-of venue New York Citys Plaza Hotel. Marion St. Claire (Bergen) isnt just the agent of the spiraling cat- spat; she also narrates this slim fable about female friendship. Its a friendship of opposites. Liv is a go-getter. See the bright young law firm associate go see her get in a meeting in which she wows a new client. Emma teaches at a middle school. Were told shes very good at her job too. We have our doubts. She cant even rebuff the brazen manipulations of fellow teacher Deb played by Kristen Johnston. For a brief spell after Liv and Emma learn their wedding dates are on a collision course there is an uneasy peace. One of them will just have to change her plans. Personal history suggests it will be Emma. It isnt. Vera Wang-clad gladiators Let the games begin. Hudson and Hathaway are adept at physical comedy. And as the mean pranks escalate they have some fun. But neither is blessed here with material worth any other sort of stretch. There are laughs. Johnston is hammy as Deb. Emma drafts her as her maid of honor. Liv conscripts her assistant. Gary Winick directs. Much like his nearly-as-tepid gal comedy ""13 Going on 30"" this film finds its zestiest scenes in a faux-impromptu dance number. It features the two bridezillas in a heated dance-off scored to Rick James fab ""Give It To Me Baby."" Go Hathaway. The menfolk -- from fiances to fathers to Livs brother Nate (Bryan Greenberg) -- get the kinder gentler often funnier toss-off lines. Steve Howey plays Livs indulgent hedge-fund manager beau. Chris Pratt does a nice job with his characters incredulity about fiancee Emmas madness. None of them quite stands out. Yet collectively interchangeably each reminds the audience how absurd all this is becoming. To a man each says the thing women in the audience hope theyll say. Then they duck. The script is the mishmash work of Greg DePaul Casey Wilson and June Diane Raphael. The latter pair created the critically lauded sketch-comedy show ""Rode Hard and Put Away Wet"" and appear here. Liv and Emmas gal-pal posse feels more like an audience of acquaintances who say theyre neutral but often seem amused by the fray and disconnected to any signs of joy. Lesson offered Women are seldom truly happy for each other. Of course this cant be the moral of the story. Rescuing it however from its own cynicism proves difficult. The looming problem with ""Bride Wars"" is that Liv and Emma lunge so quickly into uncivil combat that you never get a feel for what is at stake. The film wanly tries to build a case for their two very different yet complementary personalities but falls back on slapstick. The filmmakers make thankfully swift work of the tale in just under 90 minutes. In what could have been another laudable gesture the film is rated PG. Yet one feels that the rating is intended to lure moms and their young daughters to this less-than-edifying movie about brides turning into Frankensteins. Only the multiplex is hardly the Plaza at tea time. ""Bride Wars"" PG for suggestive content language and some rude behavior. 1 hour 28 minutes.

Comments Bride Wars Like the recent remake of The Women this wedding comedy suggests that just below the surface of every female friendship lies a toxic pool of envy and cutthroat competitiveness. A flashy aggressive lawyer (Kate Hudson) counts as her best pal a sweet and supportive middle school teacher (Anne Hathaway) but they become bitter enemies after their nuptials are coincidentally booked for the same date at New Yorks Plaza Hotel. With artifice as layered as the tiers of a marzipan cake this resembles nothing so much as a stale Rock Hudson-Doris Day comedy you know that eventually the combatants will recognize they love each other the most. Gary Winick (13 Going on 30) directed; with Candice Bergen. PG 88 min.

(Claire folger/fox 2000 pictures) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / January 9 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Ah January - that chilly unforgiving season when the major studios flush their pipes and unleash their failed projects - the lame halt and blind of movies - upon an enervated public.First out of the sluiceway is ""Bride Wars."" Its a chick flick; nothing wrong with that. But its also a chick flick that makes its chick characters - and by extension its chick audience - look like hateful backward toddlers and there is something wrong with that.Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson play Emma and Liv Manhattan career girls and BFFs whove shared an obsession with the perfect wedding ever since their moms took them to lunch at the Plazas Palm Court when they were little. (Curiously aside from Central Park and a few other exteriors most of the film was shot in Boston which will cause cognitive dissonance among local moviegoers patrons of Les Zygomates Red Sox players whose wives turn up as extras and absolutely no one else. Its official then Were Toronto.)Livs the Veronica in this twosome - a fire-breathing corporate lawyer used to getting her own way - and Emma a demure public school teacher is the Betty. Even thats overselling the thing ""Bride Wars"" is so numbingly giddy it makes ""Archie"" look like Sartre. The two get engaged to their respective boyfriends (played by Steve Howey and Chris Pratt neither of them well-known or charismatic enough to upstage the stars) and end up having their weddings scheduled for the same date time and place. Let the sabotage begin.The midsection of ""Bride Wars"" as Emma discovers her inner meanie and Liv enlists her personal assistant (Michael Arden) in the campaign has a few spiteful laughs. Liv sends Emma daily chocolates so shell bust out of her Vera Wang; Emma spikes the tanning salon formula so Liv looks like a Cheeto; Liv crashes Emmas bachelorette party at a male stripper club. And so on.First of all though what New York power lawyer is going to have her bachelorette party at a male strip club? Second of all do little girls - actual human ones that is - still dream their weddings down to the last detail except for the guy? Did they ever? I know its a movie but a movie has to have one foot in believability or heaven forbid characters who arent self-absorbed dolts.So you take the crumbs Kristen Johnston hamming it up as Emmas boozy co-worker and last-minute maid of honor; Candice Bergen stooping to her role as the citys top wedding planner with a frozen smile. Among its other sillinesses ""Bride Wars"" has a fear of larger-than-average rumps that extends to the dialogue and an inability to photograph Bergen below the waist. (At one point shes posed behind a chair so as not to scare the children.) This may be the first chick flick thats actively bulimic.Director Gary Winick hits all the farcical beats but the scripts too clueless and mean-spirited - about marriage about men about female friendship - to take off. Even given a dopey last-minute plot twist Hathaway survives on her Keane-eyed poise. Hudson though cant make Liv likable or even interesting. Even her bangs are shrewish.Worse theres no natural chemistry between her and Hathaway. How are these two even friends? When all is said and done ""Bride Wars"" is structured as a romance between two straight girlfriends - thats why all the men look like interchangeable underwear models - but theres no emotional connection to tie it together. Its a love story about two women who only love themselves.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

No its over something much more important a wedding date. Emma (a sparky Anne Hathaway) and Liv (an underwhelming Kate Hudson) have both long dreamed of June weddings at New Yorks Plaza Hotel. When their respective boyfriends propose a slip-up means they are booked on the same date. The two compete for the best DJ guest list etc -  eventually resorting to sabotage. The latter proves briefly amusing when Liv swiftly follows a sunbed prank with a pregnancy rumour. Are we about to have a little orange baby? quips Emmas boyfriend. But thats as much wit as any of the characters show and its hard to warm to these superficial women who learn the error of their ways in such an unconvincingly hasty fashion. Dry asides come from Kristen Johnstons self-absorbed maid of honour - but most of the humour is broad and basic.

Even the climactic catfight in chiffon doesnt pay off in ""Bride Wars"" a shrill mechanical comedy dedicated to the proposition that a wedding that doesnt take place at the Plaza Hotel is scarcely worth having at all. As top-billed Kate Hudson takes a producer credit here she can no longer blame anyone else for poor scripts she accepts with uncanny consistency -- 10 in a row at this point -- whereas co-star Anne Hathaway can chalk it up to a well-accoutered payday. Males will be as scarce as hens teeth at theaters showing Foxs first 2009 release but the prospect of watching the two stars shop plan and then try to undermine each others weddings guarantees a fair portion of the ""Sex and the City"" audience will consider this a good excuse for a girlsnight out. Script by Greg DePaul and the ""Rode Hard and Put Away Wet"" and ""Saturday Night Live"" writing-performing team of Casey Wilson and June Diane Raphael pivots on the notion that two lifelong best friends would become mortal enemies because of a wedding scheduling conflict at the hotel where theyve both always dreamed of getting married. Its not a pretty picture of enlightened contempo femaleness but no less believable than anything else in the film -- including in a bit of wishful thinking product placement the sights of upscale New Yorkers drinking nothing but Budweiser and of a schoolteacher signing on for a deluxe wedding without even inquiring as to the cost. But then the movie is already a period piece made before last September when price wasnt an issue. And it certainly isnt here when it comes to a wedding an event that arrives at the same time for Liv (Hudson) a steamrolling attorney and Emma (Hathaway) a demure teacher. However an uncommon error by their wedding planner (Candice Bergen neatly injecting a slightly daft note into her imperious character) puts them at odds for what is evidently the single available date at the Plaza for years to come and Emma decides that for once shes not going to let Liv have her way without a battle. From the opening bell director Gary Winick displays exceptional lack of finesse by cutting on cue to whoever is speaking a line; he wont even hold a two-shot to let some interplay develop. When the girls arent reacting to whatevers going on by saying ""Oh my God"" for the 47th time space is made for little pop-tune bridges that lead to the films few passably amusing scenes all devoted to mutual sabotage -- Emma tries to fatten Liv up by anonymously sending her candies Liv subverts Emma by injecting orange spray into the latters tanning session Emma crashes Livs bachelorette disco/stripper party and gets crowned sexiest bride et al. -- building up to D-Day June 6 when both weddings are scheduled to take place. Gilded with innocuous life lessons and no end of couture window dressing pic will go down easily enough with viewers who know and want what theyre getting into but is a time-killer for anyone else. Not pushed to hit any notes that arent in the script the capable stars are on autopilot while stereotypes are overindulged by Kristen Johnston as Emmas craven slovenly fellow teacher and Michael Arden as Livs gay associate and stand-in ""maid of honor."" Tech contributions are passable. Bride WarsProductionA 20th Century Fox release of a Fox 2000 Pictures and Regency Enterprises presentation of a New Regency/Birdie/Riche Ludwig production.

ABOUT THE MOVIEBride Wars (out of four)Stars Anne Hathaway Kate Hudson Kristen Johnston Candice BergenDirector Gary WinickDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG for suggestive content language and some rude behaviorRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Bride Wars is about as funny as a cringingly awkward wedding toast. On top of a noticeable lack of humor its absurdly sexist and mired in retro stereotypes. It might as well proclaim up front that all young woman care about is landing their MRS. TRAILER Dearly beloved preview Bride Wars here Liv (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) are lifelong pals who have nursed a girlhood dream to marry at the Plaza. When their respective boyfriends propose within days of each other they go to New York Citys most sought-after wedding planner (Candice Bergen) to set their dates. An assistant goofs and the two are booked for the same day in adjoining rooms. When neither will agree to change her wedding date their friendship turns to bitter enmity. Both women stoop to inane and unrealistic shenanigans in their vengeance. If a movie about two best friends forced to share a wedding day had come out in the 40s it might have entertained with clever banter or silly cattiness a la the original The Women. But since this is 2009 it seeks to be irreverent and mock the wedding industry but never comes close to succeeding as a satire lacking the requisite wit or zingy quips. Liv and Emmas bond never feels convincing. Hathaways Emma a caring schoolteacher has so much more depth and inherent likability that its hard to imagine why she would be acquaintances let alone friends with the overbearing materialistic and self-absorbed lawyer Liv. Hudson plays this ambitious attorney with such a lack of believability that her legal portrayal may be the films only source of comedy. She marches into boardrooms in her tight-fitting suit long blond hair and piles of eye make-up instantly winning over silver-haired captains of industry with her spunky assurances of courtroom victories. Hudson has usually managed to come across as appealing despite some awful choices of romantic comedies over the years (Fools Gold My Best Friends Girl). Not so this time. Her acting is so inert and charmless that it seems like she was replaced by a particularly obnoxious cyborg. Hathaway has had many better moments Rachel Getting Married and Becoming Jane are two notable examples. But at least there is life in her eyes. Their respective grooms are veritable cardboard cut-outs looking almost interchangeable. Heres how to tell them apart Daniel (Steve Howey) Livs intended is a stable supportive guy while Emmas fiance Fletcher (Chris Pratt) is a couch-potato lout. Bergen reprises the sort of one-dimensional role she played in Sweet Home Alabama and Miss Congeniality -- the formidable powerhouse who rules with a well-manicured iron fist. After a series of unfunny vicious schemes the movie goes all soft and mawkish at the end seemingly leaving the door open for a sequel. Unless skirmishes in the bridal registry department or catfights in yards of tulle sound like fun opt for peaceful resistance to Bride Wars.

The tune already has popped up in Must Love Dogs Taxi and the Lindsay Lohan version of The Parent Trap. Bride Wars blasts it in the first 10 minutes and does nothing to reverse the songs losing streak. There are other early signs that Bride Wars is in trouble. To begin with the premise isnt all that great. Liv (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) are best pals who share a dream of getting married at New Yorks Plaza Hotel. When the women get engaged at the same time they both land Plaza dates in June a mere three months away. Apparently booking the Plaza is as easy as getting into your local VFW hall. Because of a receptionists snafu the two wind up scheduled for the same day. Despite their 20-year friendship neither will give up the date. Like all successful mature women the two decide to deal with the situation by viciously turning on each other. Emma sends Liv sweets to fatten her up so she cant fit into her Vera Wang wedding dress. Liv sabotages Emmas visit to a tanning salon. Their shenanigans make Lucy Ricardo and Ethel Mertz look like Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi by comparison. Director Gary Winick (13 Going on 30) doesnt have a good grasp of the material; then again he doesnt have much to work with. Most of the gags fail to pay off. In one sequence Emma and her fiance are sent to a sham choreographer to work on their wedding dance. Its a setup that could be amusing but it goes nowhere in Winicks hands. When it comes to the stars Hathaway is the better of the two. Shes feisty and charming; thanks to her big brown eyes she resembles a wounded fawn when she cries. Thats about all the role demands from her. Hudson fares a lot worse as she is starting to look and sound exactly like her mom Goldie Hawn. Unfortunately here she looks like Hawn at 45 and Hudson is only 29. She also has hardened and lacks her moms warmth; shes like Hawns evil twin rather than her offspring. The movie ends with the door wide open for a sequel; one cant imagine anyone involved jumping at the thought. Well except for Natalie Cole who must love those royalty checks.

In this shiny sitcom pilot that looks like something yanked from NBCs shelves circa 1989 Hathaway is back to bright smiles and dewy eyes as schoolmarm Emma who with lifelong galpal Liv (Kate Hudson) has always dreamed of a June wedding at the Plaza. Alas a scheduling snafu means both brides-to-be have to share the date which solely for the purpose of an 88-minute film that feels as though itll last till July they refuse to do. Hence all manner of juvenile hijinks (Liv dyes Emmas skin orange; Emma streaks Livs hair blue) that linger till the icky ""I do""s (or do they?). A step backward for Hathaway Bride Wars is one more step into the quicksand for Hudson whos spent the nine years since Almost Famous wandering the rom-com wasteland in search of an exit strategy; this movie which she exec produced aint it. The biggest giggle comes in the opening credits Cinematography by Frederick Elmes best known for working with David Lynch and Jim Jarmusch. Really Fred? Really? (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - NOT EASILY BROKEN Would that the sparring spouses of Revolutionary Road had only thought to turn to the Lord for help; it would have solved all of their pesky problems. Such is the lesson to be taken from Not Easily Broken the second feature film (after 2004s Woman Thou Art Loosed) adapted from the novels of Dallas televangelist T.D. Jakes. Directed by actor Bill Duke (whose erratic behind-the-camera career has ranged from the searing neonoir Deep Cover to the altacocker crowd-pleaser The Cemetery Club) Not Easily Broken begins in 1995 with the wedding of pro-baseball player Dave (Morris Chestnut) and upwardly mobile real estate agent Clarice (Benjamin Buttons Taraji P. Henson) then catches up to the present where a knee injury has sidelined Dave into a contracting career and Clarices taste for luxury finds the couple living well beyond their means. Its not long before the strands of their union begin to fray abetted by a car accident that leaves Clarice with a mangled leg to complement Daves metaphorical knee. Tragedy lurks around every bend here along with the requisite quotient of meddling mothers-in-law derelict baby-daddies and Nordic-looking white temptresses -- all of it played to the rafters for an unsteady mixture of Sirkian melodrama and ""You go girl""/""Oh no he didnt"" empowerment fable. These resourceful actors -- to say nothing of the audience -- deserve better. ""Dont go all Waiting to Exhale on me"" advises one of Clarices soul sisters late in the film. If only. (Citywide) (Scott Foundas).TRACING COWBOYS The actors and screenplay of Tracing Cowboys are upstaged by the cinematography of David Morrison who shot the movie on HD. Whether its the staggering expanse of the Mexican landscape or close-ups on weathered faces Morrisons handiwork gives Tracing a meditative beauty. The rest of director Jason Wulfsohns sophomore feature inspired by and constantly referencing John Fords The Searchers is a little less successful. Struggling country singer Ethan (Sacha Grunpeter who also wrote the script) and amateur photographer Debi (Megan Charlotte Edwards) are an oil-and-water couple alternating lovemaking with fiery battles. When Debi impetuously takes off to Mexico Ethan follows using as his guide the photos mailed back from Debis route. The slow-moving fractured tale is told in flashbacks that seamlessly mingle with the present making for confusing if gorgeous viewing. The romanticized depiction of Mexicans (stoic filled with wisdom) veers toward patronizing but what drags the film down is Debis voice-over filled with cliched philosophizing (""I guess you can be standing next to someone and still feel alone""). Press notes reveal that the narration was added after Grunpeter died just before the films completion. His loss adds to Tracing Cowboys a layer of melancholy that the film actually earns in the third act when Ethan meets Debi in an unexpected way and his past is revealed to the audience for a very moving ending. (Downtown Independent) (Ernest Hardy)THE UNBORN As it forges ahead without explanations The Unborn works in its way as a series of snap-cut gotchas introducing each new contestant in its pageant of cold-sweat set pieces. Often this involves starlet Odette Yustman approaching some obscured inevitably terrifying figure from behind very ... very ... slowly. Yustman plays Casey a well-heeled young suburbanite whos been having bad dreams. The night terrors begin to infest her waking life when while babysitting one of those whey-faced grade-schoolers who populate modern horror films as if by quota the kiddie cryptically intones ""Jumby wants to be born now."" Trying to figure out what that means leads Casey and The Unborn into a thicket of exposition involving suicided mothers Nazi mad geneticists and kabbalah/Jewish folklore. The titular reference to from-the-womb haunting is only an afterthought; The Unborn more fully belongs to the durable exorcism subgenre complete with a climactic exorcism-by-committee that plays like a pandenominational PC update of TheExorcists implicit verification of Catholicisms One True Faith. Tune out the battle royale bombast and start wondering where to eat after the movie. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton)YONKERS JOE Yonkers Joe (Chazz Palminteri) is an old-school gambler who scams Atlantic City casinos dances on the brink of commitment with his lovely accomplice Janice (Christine Lahti) and fends off responsibility for his severely autistic teenage son Joe Jr. (Tom Guiry). In terms of inspiration Yonkers Joe (directed by Robert Celestino) breaks about even with its eponym. In the films most animated sequences Joe and his crew are like a troupe of crooked magicians out-dazzling each other with new tricks and devices always looking not just for the biggest payout but the most elaborate dupe. When Joe Jr. ages out of his treatment facility Joe contemplates a risky pull one that will yield enough money to send the boy to a home where the walls are perhaps padded with cashmere. The trio ends up in Vegas where Janices diligent affection toward Joe Jr. backfires in the worst way imaginable and the latter redeems himself by entering into his fathers hustling fray. Lahti burns through a thinly written role with a surprising level of warmth and humanity and Guiry is at times repellently convincing as a kid genetically incapable of either nuance or fakery. Palminteri though looks tired of twitching his shoulders and working a pompadour in two-bit roles like this.

In Bride Wars its funny and telling that when they land a meeting with New Yorks most fabled wedding planner (Candice Bergen) theyre already so steeped in the minutiae of matrimony that its clear they could do the job just as well themselves. Both women have spent their lives dreaming of a June wedding at the Plaza (you wonder how recently theyve checked their daddies stock portfolios) but due to a logistical screwup they end up booking their nuptials there on the exact same day. Its not clear why this is such a big problem but it is. Neither one will budge which leads to an escalating battle of the sorority-bitch gambits One dyes the ? others hair blue revenge is served up at a tanning ? salon and so on. Directed by the usually more supple Gary Winick (13 Going on 30) Bride Wars isnt really a romantic comedy since the two grooms-to-be have about as much presence as waiters. The comedy is all about these bazooka-brained brides and their holy right to treat a wedding as more important than you know marriage. Hudson her sunny good cheer baked to a dominatrix flatness and Hathaway her long-limbed smiling charm all a-gangle go at their frilly ? obsessions like joyless rival executives. Bride Wars pretends to be a satire of wedding mania but since theres virtually nothing else to the movie the satire comes depressingly close to endorsement.

"Movie review Bride Wars -- 2 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Bride Wars -- 2 out of 5 stars Liv (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) are best friends who have planned every detail of their respective weddings. At the top of their ""must have"" list a ceremony at New Yorks Plaza Hotel. Now theyre both about to get married; and realize their dreams...or maybe not...thanks to a clerical error causing a clash in wedding dates. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The big problem with the romantic comedy Bride Wars seems as plain as the opening credits.This movie about ""the best day in a girls life"" about two lifelong friends who have planned their ""June at The Plaza"" weddings since childhood was directed by a man. Another man came up with the story. No matter that women pitched in and tried to inject a little estrogen into the proceedings. Its still a patronizing comedy that rolls its boyish eyes at the tizzy these brides work themselves into over their big day. Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson play the pals Jersey girls whose lives were changed by a magical visit to New Yorks Plaza Hotel as children the place to get married in the month for weddings -- June.Liv (Hudson) has grown up into being a pushy litigator used to winning and getting her own way. Emma (Hathaway) has matured into a pushover school teacher who lets everybody else impose their will on her. They get engaged the same day. They visit the Mother of All Wedding Planners ( Candice Bergen who also narrates) together. And thats how things get mixed up and they find themselves not sharing and helping each other make their dreams come true but competing for wedding guests reception DJs and everything else associated with ""the day your life begins.""Emmas ""elegantly minimalist"" affair runs into Livs ""trendy fusion"" nuptials so let the dirty tricks fly as each one-ups the other -- the wedding ""video montage"" switcheroo sabotage at the hair salon the works. The grooms (Chris Pratt and Steve Howey) are mere bland eyewitnesses to this prize fight.""Your wedding had better watch it"" threatens Liv in what passes for a giggle here.Both weddings are slated for June 6 which nobody involved was clever enough to realize is the anniversary of D-Day. Thats not the only joke they missed. Director Gary Winick may have 13 Going on 30 and an Ugly Betty episode on his resume but he cant find the laughs in this set-up or these two funny ladies. The supporting cast ( Kristen Johnston plays a maid of honor) fares no better. The third acts sentimental moments are the only bits that work and they come long after weve stopped caring which leading lady wears the most jet-black eye-liner.The title Bride Wars promises farce wacky cat-fights and that learning moment when they and we realize ""Its not about the wedding. Its about love and the life that follows."" The movie breaks those vows. Its a picture that never comes to life before the ""death do us part.""
