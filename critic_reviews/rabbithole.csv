Writer David Lindsay-Abaire adapting his own Tony-winning stage play and director John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch Shortbus) make a bold stab at something midway between the two with Rabbit Hole a film which refuses to bow to sentiment while allowing us insight into the arduous emotional journeys of its characters. That they dont quite succeed is disappointing but maybe inevitable and its certainly not due to a lack of ambition on the part of Mitchell or his impressive cast.Making the most of her inherent imposing frostiness Nicole Kidman is a blank page as Becca a suburban soccer mom whose beloved four-year-old son has recently died in a car accident leaving her utterly disconnected from the world particularly husband Howie (Aaron Eckhart). While Becca imprisons herself in icy solitude Howie tries to find a way out of his grief through counselling sessions hard work soft drugs and a fleeting flirtation with the ever-watchable Sandra Oh. But his life cant return to anything approaching normality until Becca finds the strength to open up.The problem with Rabbit Hole is that it plays at one unrelentingly gloomy frequency occasional moments of humour or tension are simply unable to puncture the overriding sense of oppressive sadness. Our feelings towards Becca and Howie are constantly challenged and upended but however much we understand them we never come to like them. This is almost certainly as Mitchell intended but it does make for a muted unsatisfying experience.

By Peter Rainer Film critic January 14 2011 Save for later Saved Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart play a wife and husband who take very different approaches to coping with the loss of their son in Rabbit Hole. Lionsgate          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In movies about the consequences of grief nothing is gained if the grief overwhelms not only the characters in the film but also those of us in the audience. Filmmakers must bring us into the sorrow without wiping us out.""Rabbit Hole"" directed by John Cameron Mitchell and written by David Lindsay-Abaire adapting his Pulitzer Prize-winning play stars Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart as parents attempting to cope with the accidental death of their 4-year-old son eight months before. Becca (Kidman) wants to move away from their comfy middle-class suburban New York home and all its reminders of little Danny. Howie (Eckhart) wants to surround himself with everything that summons up his son.Related Ten best movies of 2010 Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Virtually every scene in the movie underscores this stark divide. Although the filmmakers try to avoid roteness the conflicts tend to play out along circumscribed lines. This gives the film a seesaw sameness. Its all a bit too diagrammed. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? It doesnt help that Lindsay-Abaire who has expanded the parameters of his play provides Becca with far more of a back story than Howie about whom we learn relatively little. Theres a generic quality to his heavy-duty sadness. In terms of her own family history Becca has more to work through and consequently Kidman as an actress has more to work with.We are repeatedly confronted for example with Beccas fraught relationship with her younger sister (Tammy Blanchard) and with her mother Nat (Dianne Wiest) who herself lost a son years ago. We can sense and this is a tribute to the performers just how frayed these connections were even before the tragedy.Although the films ostensible centerpiece is the back-and-forth between Becca and Howie the sharpest scenes are between Becca and her mother. Kidman has a tendency to seem closed-off even in movies such as ""Moulin Rouge"" where she is supposed to be expansive. (She was perfect casting for the remake of ""The Stepford Wives."") For all the turmoil she enacts in ""Rabbit Hole"" Kidman still looks as if she could benefit from a good thawing-out. But especially in her scenes with Wiest who is marvelous Kidman drops her guard and opens up. The programmatic pain turns into real pain.The filmmakers recognize that showing unrelieved misery doesnt serve the cause of understanding misery and so they pepper the proceedings with humor often black but sometimes gray or off-white. This is a movie about people who are not really certain how to mourn and their contortions at times carry a grim levity.This shows up most pointedly in the support group scenes where grieving parents take turns opening up. Fed up with the feel-good nostrums she believes are being spewed Becca lashes out at a couple who have put their faith in God. Despite or perhaps because of her air of enraged triumphalism she comes across as an uncaring jerk. She feels too much - and yet not enough. (The best thing about the support group sequences is the introduction of a character played by Sandra Oh who has a flirty camaraderie with Howie.)""Rabbit Hole"" is least believable in the scenes in which Becca secretly dogs the trail of the teenager Jason (Miles Teller) who was driving the car that accidentally killed her son. Jason is working through his own grief by concocting a comic book whose ""Alice in Wonderland""-ish contents suggest the films title. The rapprochement between these two sufferers seems too pat - its another nostrum but one we and Becca are meant to take seriously.With a movie this steeped in dreariness the rewards for watching it should be commensurate. This doesnt quite happen.For all its sympathy and intelligence ""Rabbit Hole"" is ultimately too safe an experience for such a free-form tragedy.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Coincidence can be a potent friend to the critic. While the opening of exquisite dramas ""Blue Valentine"" and ""Rabbit Hole"" in Denver today is a function of the way indie distributors roll out movies (starting on the coasts then moving into other markets in hopes of good critical buzz) it also says something about the good the sad and the ugly of contemporary movie culture. For instance what are the studios opening this weekend ostensibly the start of the new movie year? The superhero buddy flick ""The Green Hornet"" and the marital buddy comedy ""The Dilemma."" The first is awful. ""The Dilemma"" I have hopes for. Or maybe its a soft spot I love Vince Vaughn and Kevin James and trust director Ron Howard. But like so much of the fare outside of awards season these films seem like evidence that studios are content to abandon adult moviegoers the rest of the year. ""Blue Valentine"" and ""Rabbit Hole"" have emotionally brave performances especially by their heavily tasked leads -- Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams; Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart. Both display telling writing and a love of craft. A month before Valentines Day ""Blue Valentine"" comes on like a bittersweet cautionary tale. A dog goes missing near a well-traveled road in Queens N.Y. The resulting loss becomes the catalyst to a greater one in Derek Cianfrances slow-burn of an out-of-love story. Gosling and Williams are Dean and Cindy. Shes a nurse who once wanted to be a doctor. Hes a house painter who seemed never to have had a career ambition. He smokes. He drinks a bit too much too early. But hes a loving dad to Frankie (Faith Wladyka) and in his way a dedicated husband. But his way may not work for Cindy any longer. ""Blue Valentine"" moves back and forth between the couples increasingly frustrated present and their lovely if complicated beginning six years earlier. Dean is the romantic in this tale. He falls for Cindy when he sees her in her grandmothers room at an assisted-living facility. Hes there not because he has family. Hes visiting a man whom he moved into the apartment across the way. Dean may be aimless but his heart is true. Gosling makes him decent and sympathetic. Written by Cianfrance and longtime collaborator Joey Curtis ""Blue Valentine"" grasps Deans soul better than it does Cindys. Scenes with her grandmother and her parents provide hints about why she may be suspicious of love. Not all of her decisions and moods ring authentic yet Williams is such an attentive performer that she makes them compelling. Dean insists they take a trip to a motel. Its a bright idea born of desperation. Rife with yearning and rejection graphic intimacy and furious ache the motel scenes offer wrenching images of a train derailing. The Ramp;B find ""You and Me"" by Penny amp; the Quarters adds yet another layer to the couples anguished hope and broken promises. ""Rabbit Hole"" directed with grace and surprising humor by John Cameron Mitchell is a delicate tale that shares a great deal of the hurt of Robert Redfords ""Ordinary People."" It takes us down into the dim purgatory of two still-grieving parents. Its been eight months since Becca and Howie Corbett lost their 4-year-old son. They are beginning to take different routes to what may or may not be recovery. And as often happens they are being gently left to their mourning by the world that must go on. Beccas sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard) announces sheepishly that shes pregnant. A family friend has never summoned the courage to call Becca though it is clear that she and her husband once visited frequently and have children similar in age. Its as if a friends grief could plunge you into your own dark place. David Lindsay-Abaire adapted his Pulitzer Prize-winning play for the screen. And ""Rabbit Hole"" is a more evocative piece for getting out of a one-room setting. A neighborhood takes shape. The leafy road the Corbetts live on is upscale but not ostentatious. At night their house -- a big handsome Victorian -- takes on an amber glow the hue of nostalgia. Frank G. DeMarcos cinematography captures space and place with elegance. Miles Teller plays Jason a quiet teen whom Becca begins to stalk then befriend. The reasons become clear over time. Becca is not the only one who establishes a complicated relationship outside the couples sphere of sorrow. Howie and Becca attend a support group for grieving parents. Sandra Oh portrays Gabby who along with her tight-lipped husband is a group veteran. Becca hates the group. Howie and Gabby become compatriots. The often incomparable Dianne Wiest portrays Becca and Izzys mother Nat. She too knows much about the loss of a child. But lessons come hard and slow -- the better to grow -- in this elegiac work. ""BLUE VALENTINE"" R for strong graphic sexual content language and a beating. 1 hour 54 minutes. Directed by Derek Cianfrance; written by Cianfrance and Joey Curtis; photography by Andrij Parekh; starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Opens today at the Mayan theater. ""RABBIT HOLE.""

Comments click to enlarge Rabbit Hole Recommended Rated PG-13  91 minutes  2010 Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart star as a husband and wife inconsolable after the death of their young son. Adapted by David Lindsay-Abaire from his own play this quiet but uncompromising drama explores the isolating power of grief in the same way as Todd Fields In the Bedroom (2001). But whereas that film developed into a story about the allure and futility of revenge this one acknowledges the unhappy truth that theres no emotional resolution for a parent grieving over a child. Unmoored by the tragedy the spouses drift apart--he considers an affair with another bereaved mother she pursues an awkward rapprochement with the guilt-ridden teenage driver who ran over their boy--and the only question seems to be whether theyll ever manage to share in the pain. John Cameron Mitchell directed making an impressive detour in style and subject matter after his flamboyant Shortbus (2006) and Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001). By J.R.

Lionsgate Films Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart in ""Rabbit Hole"" (Lionsgate Films) Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) are in danger of breaking up. Its not that they dont love each other. Its a question of whether love is enough to save their marriage.She cant get over a family tragedy. He cant be happy unless she does. To her their house is a reminder of something terrible. To him its a comfort. So much so that when Becca suggests that they sell it Howie grimaces. But hes not the only person who triggers Beccas anger. She can barely stay in the same room with her pregnant sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard) or their mom Nat (Dianne Wiest) without getting into an argument. It doesnt matter that theyre only trying to help her move on. Or that Howie is drifting away.Becca cant forget the day their small son was killed or forgive herself for allowing it to happen. And Howie cant let go of the house that once was the boys playground. ""Rabbit Hole"" based on David Lindsay-Abaires Pulitzer Prize-winning play is a tough raw drama about wounds that heal only gradually if at all. Working from a screenplay by Lindsay-Abaire director John Cameron Mitchell makes a successful transition from his lighter quirkier films ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" and ""Shortbus.""In an outstanding performance Kidman uncompromisingly captures Beccas rage. Eckhart who is best known for his performances in ""In the Company of Men"" and ""The Dark Knight"" has often been denied his due as an actor. But his poignant portrayal of Howie should bolster his reputation.

Rabbit Hole (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Rabbit Hole (PG-13) A beautifully acted study of a married couple emerging from the paralysis of grief Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald1/12/2011 Editor rating 3 How can I convince you that a movie centered on a couple in deep grief over the death of their son isnt a total downer? I havent been able to talk about Rabbit Hole with anyone I know. Most people -- especially parents -- literally scurry away when I mention it They dont even want to hear about it. The loss of a child is so colossal that when filmmakers try to deal with the subject head-on the result is usually either wan and superficial (The Lovely Bones) or too painful to qualify as entertainment (Im still scarred from sneaking into Sophies Choice when I was 15.) Rabbit Hole which was directed by John Cameron Mitchell (Shortbus Hedwig and the Angry Inch) from a screenplay by David Lindsay-Abaire (adapting his Pulitzer-winning play) begins eight months after Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) lost 4-year-old Danny when he chased his dog into the path of an oncoming car. The volcanic eruptions of grief have passed and the couple is slowly trying to re-enter the world - slowly being the key word. Becca has quit her job at Sothebys and now dedicates her energy to cooking and gardening. Howie has managed to convince her to attend group therapy with him but she doesnt believe the sessions do any good. Their sex life remains non-existent. Dannys dog has been banished to the home of Beccas mom Nat (Dianne Wiest) who doesnt understand why her daughter hasnt turned to the church for comfort and support. Beccas sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard) announces -- with the worst timing imaginable for what otherwise would have been greeted as great news -- that shes pregnant. (In one of the films best most disquieting moments Becca tries to give Izzy all of Dannys clothes an offer understandably refused.) The plot of Rabbit Hole follows Becca and Howie as they deal with their sorrow in radically different ways. She wants to sell the house move away and eradicate all traces that her son ever existed (although she is compelled to befriend the teenaged driver of the car that killed him -- her desperate compulsive attempt at healing). Howie compulsively watches home videos of his son resents Becca for removing his drawings from the refrigerator door and gently tries to restore a rhythm of familiarity and ritual to his disheveled marriage. When he suggests to Becca they should try to have sex again she looks at him as if he were from another planet. Mitchell whose previous films were flamboyant provocations displays an entirely different approach to storytelling here keeping the visuals simple and the tone quiet sneaking unexpected humor into a seemingly humorless situation and allowing his cast to carry the show. Rabbit Hole doesnt feel sterile and stage bound like filmed plays often do. But the performances by Kidman -- a gifted actress who has become easy to take for granted like Meryl Streep -- and Eckhart have the depth and subtlety of theater actors who have become intimately familiar with their roles and are able to express complex emotions with a simple look or gesture. Rabbit Hole doesnt achieve the level of catharsis Mitchell aims for As much as we come to know and sympathize with Becca and Howie something about them remains artificial and unknowable. You cant imagine that they were ever happy even before they lost their son because they never quite register as real people. But on a larger thematic level Rabbit Hole is absorbing and hugely compelling a thoughtful portrayal of the myriad ways in which we learn to deal with the unthinkable. You just have to learn to bear the weight. Cast Nicole Kidman Aaron Eckhart Dianne Wiest Miles Teller Tammy Blanchard Sandra Oh Giancarlo Esposito. Director John Cameron Mitchell.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + At first glance ""Rabbit Hole is this years entry in Oscars semiannual grief-porn category. Look at the posters the trailers the stills -- surely this tale of parents coping with the death of their 5-year-old son is a sensitive and thoroughly depressing downer. Well no its more than that -- a lot more. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by David Lindsay-Abaire brought to the screen by the quixotically gifted playwright-turned-filmmaker John Cameron Mitchell (""Hedwig and the Angry Inch ""Shortbus) and acted with frighteningly calm clarity by its stars ""Rabbit Hole is something altogether different a comedy about loss.A comedy? In the sense that bleak laughter is the last resort of the afflicted yes. Bearing a rough resemblance to 2006s ""Little Children in its open-eyed take on suburban discontents this pained often beautiful film is about two people whove essentially died yet are surprised -- and saddened and annoyed -- to discover theyre still living. The auto accident that claimed their son is eight months in the past when ""Rabbit Hole opens but Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) are just coming out of a fugue state of mourning. What does that look like and will the world let them? These are the questions the movie ponders.They go to group counseling with other grieving parents but Becca is creeped out by the God talk and by the couples whove been attending for years. However she chooses to cope with her pain it wont be by becoming addicted to it. So she starts clearing out the boys closet and taking his drawings off the fridge; in one awful scene she ""accidentally deletes a video from her husbands iPhone. To Howie this is an act of sacrilege something so wrong he can barely put words to it.Lindsay-Abaires dialogue and Mitchells gentle direction never press the films points. Instead they simply observe as the couple run on parallel tracks veering away and toward each other. Howie strikes up a secret friendship with one of the counseling groups moms (Sandra Oh) that involves grateful flirtation and other illicit activities. Becca chooses to stalk the teenage boy (Miles Teller) who drove the car that hit their son eventually sharing with him a hesitant but genuine companionship of the damned. Teller is very good as an average kid whose sudden acquaintance with guilt has left him decades older than his peers.These characters cling to each other with the camaraderie of people whove been through the worst. They speak a language -- caustic stunned often brutally funny -- that most of us never want to learn. ""Rabbit Hole understands that we treat other peoples tragedies as contagion a virus that spreads into every corner of our forced good cheer. One of Beccas friends still hasnt worked up the nerve to call her. In the movies most unsettling scene Howie shows the house to prospective buyers comes to his sons room and terrifies the couple with his low-key acknowledgment of disaster. They cant get out of there fast enough -- death might be catching.Mitchell opens the play up to the neat lawns of the New York suburbs but ""Rabbit Hole dips into blue-collar territory whenever Becca visits her blowsy mother (Dianne Wiest) and party-girl sister (Tammy Blanchard). The mother keeps trying to tie her daughters loss to the death of her own son -- older and from his own lousy choices -- but Beccas having none of it. Among other things ""Rabbit Hole is about the fierce protectiveness with which we own our sorrows as well as our difficulty in giving them away.Still these scenes feel like a misstep. Brittle and contained Becca doesnt seem like she comes from the same planet let alone the same clan as the other two women. That may be the point. Shes part of a larger family now.Eckhart works close to the top of his range here -- Howie is a guys guy ill-equipped to fight something he cant see -- but Kidman simply goes above and beyond. The actress has taken a lot of guff in the past few years for misadventures both cinematic and cosmetic but this is a subtle bone-deep performance attuned to impatience and rage gallows humor and the eeriest sort of quiet. ""Rabbit Hole is a personal project for Kidman -- she produced the film after falling in love with the play -- and it seems to have revived the quickness in her. That ice-blue gaze has found its focus again and it looks deep into the one thing none of us want to face.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Starring Nicole Kidman Aaron Eckhart Sandra Oh Jon Tenney Dianne Wiest Giancarlo Esposito Miles Teller Mike Doyle Tammy Blanchard Patricia Kalember Director John Cameron Mitchell Release Opened Dec 25 2010  Editorial Review Resilience in the darkest of timesBy Ann HornadaySaturday December 25 2010How do you recover from the death of a child? The movie ""Rabbit Hole"" eloquently posits the only correct answer to that question You dont. Based on David Lindsay-Abaires acclaimed 2006 play of the same name ""Rabbit Hole"" focuses on a grieving couple eight months after their young son was killed by a car while chasing his dog into the street. What on the surface seems to possess all the melodrama and photogenic suffering of a banal prime-time weepie instead becomes a lucid tough deeply sensitive examination of emotional fortitude. Its important for viewers to know that its okay to laugh during ""Rabbit Hole."" Thanks to Lindsay-Abaires mastery of difficult tonal shifts and John Cameron Mitchells alert nimble direction laughs and tears co-exist if not comfortably at least recognizably as equally necessary to surviving lifes most devastating moments. In Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart Mitchell has found actors who gracefully pull off that psychological high-wire act as Becca and Howie an attractive prosperous couple who have reached the point in their mourning where most of their friends and neighbors think its time to be moving on. Howie tries to do this by attending support-group meetings and contemplating another child. Becca cooks compulsively repels the efforts of friends to get together and goes about daily life with crisp matter-of-factness even when it comes to removing their sons drawings from the refrigerator. Becca reserves her cruelest barbs for her mother Nat (Dianne Wiest) who lost a grown son to drug addiction but whose attempts at empathy Becca resents as unearned comparisons. (Sandra Oh and Tammy Blanchard as a support group member and Beccas sister respectively provide welcome comic relief for the films most discomfiting encounters.) Becca eventually discovers solace in the most surprising place imaginable but ""Rabbit Hole"" resists facile catharsis or easy equivalencies. Thanks in large part to Kidmans refusal to soften her characters most fascinating sharp edges as well as Mitchells superb command of the material ""Rabbit Hole"" gives the lie to such comforting fictions as closure and transcendence. As Wiest suggests in her characters moving soliloquy sometimes the best thing to do with feelings isnt to ""process"" or ""work through"" them but simply to feel them. ""Hanging in there"" can often seem like a meaningless cliche but in ""Rabbit Hole"" the phrase takes on newfound meaning as perhaps the hardest most heroic thing in the world to do.Contains mature thematic material drug use and profanity.

Rabbit Hole Good Director John Cameron Mitchell. Cast Nicole Kidman Aaron Eckhart Dianne Wiest. Rating PG-13 for mature thematic material some drug use and language. Note At Harkins Camelview. Guide to this weeks new releases Qamp;A Aaron Eckhart happily excels Kidman weeps in Rabbit Hole revels in home life Forget recovery acceptance moving on. Just getting through the day is the task at hand in ""Rabbit Hole"" John Cameron Mitchells film of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by David Lindsay-Abaire. Nicole Kidman gives one of the best performances of her career as a grieving mother who will deal with the death of her 4-year-old son on her own terms thank you very much. Aaron Eckhart also is outstanding as her husband trying to grieve in his own separate way. The film is quiet patient allowing for lived-in performances that get at the enormous change in the characters lives. If it sounds like difficult material it is - although we dont see the death of their son (the film takes place a few months afterward) we certainly see its effects. But the film is not without humor some of it brought to bear in unusual places - a meeting of grief survivors for example or a birthday party at a bowling alley. Becca (Kidman) gave up her lucrative job when her son was born. Howie (Eckhart) still goes off to work returning each night to their nice suburban home where he has dinner engages in banal conversation with Becca and later watches home movies of their son picking at a scab he will not allow to heal. He needs the survivors support group; Becca ridicules it not as a dig at Howie but as something that holds people captive in their mourning revisiting it unwilling or unable to move on. As you would imagine this is not ideal for their relationship. Howie befriends Gaby (Sandra Oh) who has been attending the sessions for years. Becca meanwhile putters in her garden and navigates the tricky relationships with her mother Nat (Dianne Wiest excellent) who has endured her own tragedies and sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard) who is to Beccas consternation pregnant. Then one day Becca runs across Jason (Miles Teller) the teenage boy who was driving the car that hit her son (who had chased his dog into the street). Its clumsy of course at times almost stalker-ish but it also reveals the damage inflicted upon Jason as well. (The films title comes from a graphic novel Jason has created dealing with alternate universes and lives.) Teller nails Jasons awkwardness and guilt; like everyone else he wants to move on but cant. Wiest gives Nat a certain battiness that at times is charming at times maddening (especially to Becca). Eckhart has a habit of playing opposite actors who do career-best work (Julia Roberts in ""Erin Brocko- vich"" Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Night""). It can be thankless work. It shouldnt be. Here he brings both pain and humor to a challenging part enhancing what Kidman does never overshadowing it. And theres no question that its ultimately Kidmans film. Movies made from plays can be tricky. As in ""Doubt"" for instance the cast tends to want to play to the back row. Kidman does none of that. She draws us into Beccas damaged world in small ways. She and Mitchell trust that the audience will be patient as the character and the story develop. Both do and thanks to Kidmans remarkably naturalistic performance its worth the wait.

To paraphrase John Lennon death is what happens while youre making other plans. The Corbetts showplace home becomes a swamp of toxic emotions. Howie thinks the path out of grief might come through support-group sessions. Becca attends grudgingly arms bitterly crossed. She has only contempt for ""professional wallowers"" who lie down and accept the cosmic injustice of a dead child. Becca is defiantly inconsolable. Her tamped-down rage is sad and awful and intimidating. One couples faith that God took their child because ""he needed another angel"" sets her off like an explosive charge. ""Why didnt he just make one?"" she demands. ""I mean hes God after all"" Filling her days with garden projects and baking she has constructed a sanctuary of suppressed grief. Howie who tries to use Al Green mood music and shoulder rubs to break the ice and rekindle their sex life worries hes about to lose his marriage. Nicole Kidman is strikingly good as Becca infusing clipped dialogue and fleeting expressions with great depth of feeling. Becca examines every social interaction like a code-breaker looking for secret messages intended to console and condescend or to impatiently urge her to get over it. Her floozy sister Izzys pregnancy strikes Becca as an insensitive rebuke to her suffering indifferent life pressing ahead as she stands still. When their mother Nat reminisces about her own recovery from the son she lost Becca is provoked. Arthur was a 30-year-old junkie Danny was an innocent child. ""He was still my son"" Nat replies. Theres hard-won wisdom in her response (and Dianne Wiests benign smile) but Becca treats her like an unfeeling fool. As Howie Aaron Eckhart doesnt travel to the same emotional extremes. His grieving is done at a lower register. He secretly cherishes old cell-phone videos of Danny and wants to maintain his room as a shrine. He even keeps the kiddie seat buckled in the rear of their car; after all they could have another child again soon couldnt they? Unlike the repressed Becca Howie strains to make contact with life sadly fumbling his way toward friendship with another woman in their support group (the appealing Sandra Oh). Every step he makes is from Beccas vantage point the wrong step. As soon as he steps through the door hes in the hurt locker and Eckharts dispirited eyes show it. ""Rabbit Hole"" adapted by David Lindsay-Abaire from his Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway play is often rough going intentionally so. It covers rocky emotional terrain with bracing honesty as two smart decent people with different temperaments and personalities try to recuperate from an unimaginable trauma. The film is directed by bad-boy provocateur John Cameron Mitchell (of the transgender musical ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" and the porn-infused comedy-drama ""Shortbus"") with wonderful maturity and sophistication. Tense and mournful as it is the film also has moments of wild hilarity and a sense of hope. RABBIT HOLE  1/2 out of 4 stars Opens Saturday. Rating PG-13 for mature thematic material some drug use language. Theater Uptown. A scarred young comic-book artist Becca meets theorizes that there are unseen portals all around us leading to alternate dimensions where our lives work out differently. Therefore a happy life is just as valid a possibility as a wrecked one. Significantly ""Rabbit Hole"" unfolds nine months after Dannys death; this is a story of a messy painful protracted cathartic rebirth. Ultimately you feel the question is not Will they make it? Its How will they make it?

Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) in RABBIT HOLE. Photo JoJo Whilden Lionsgate Rabbit Hole review Sad event stultifying film 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Rabbit Hole Drama. Starring Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart. Directed by John Cameron Mitchell. (PG-13. 90 minutes. Beginning Saturday at Bay Area theaters.) A young married couple goes from the land of the lucky to the land of the scarred and shattered when their 4-year-old son is killed by a car right in front of the house. ""Rabbit Hole"" based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by David Lindsay-Abaire deals with the aftermath of tragedy about what happens months down the line when all the formalities are long over. Everything that can be done has been done and all thats left is a huge hole where there once was life. The movies area of inquiry is essentially undramatic a tale told in a minor key but its sensitive and illuminates areas of experience that usually go unexplored. What happens to the couple each one grieving separately each one associating the other with loss? How do friends talk to them? Its easy to console people when you dont think their misfortune is all that bad but what do you say to somebody experiencing your own worst nightmare? ""Rabbit Hole"" depicts the isolating nature of grief a self-isolation that is also to some degree community enforced. As a viewing experience the film is by turns heartrending and stultifying but mostly stultifying. Partly this is a natural consequence of the movies atmosphere. Inside the house of the grieving parents played by Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart everything is steeped in gloom and its an effort just to breathe. We are made to understand how in their misery they might be tempted to flee such an environment and possibly the marriage. Still it cant really be director John Cameron Mitchells intention that the audience should also want to flee - the theater. Related Stories Rabbit Hole The imprimatur of the Pulitzer weighs heavily on the screenplay in that Lindsay-Abaire in adapting his work must have felt a responsibility to change as little as possible. But alas there is something very literalizing about cinema that works to this materials detriment. What onstage seemed emblematic becomes specific. What onstage seemed to be happening over there to those people feels as though its happening in the same room with us. And - this is particularly curious - what felt like a climax in the play feels like a non-event onscreen more an ellipsis than an ending. But the movie might also be suffering from something else - this is the awkward part of the review which is why Im mentioning it now not earlier - and thats the smooth unreality of Nicole Kidmans face. Becca (Kidman) is a woman who was probably prickly and abrasive even before the tragedy. (Cynthia Nixon a natural for this terrain played the role on Broadway.) She is a very particular type of no-nonsense real person and its distracting to find oneself wondering why such a woman would have had lip injections and a forehead that looks like porcelain. Yes its impolite to say it. But Becca takes a lot of her anger out on her husband and to see aggression coming from such a clean manufactured face just seems more harsh than from the face of a regular hapless torn-up person. Furthermore this is a story about vulnerability about being human and the awful transitions that life can throw at people. Right now Kidmans look has taken her beyond the shoals of representing that kind of earthbound experience. She does lovely work in the film but its as if her performance and her face are at cross-purposes. By the way if you think I relish saying this youre wrong. Often mens complaints about womens cosmetic interventions are just misogyny in disguise a backdoor way for men to mock middle-aged or older women under the sanctimonious cover of faux feminism. Whod want to join that chorus or risk looking like a member? But if you care about movies and about the women in them - especially when you consider that even someone like Kidman could get caught in this glamour trap a big talent whose greatest triumph was in a plain-faced role in ""The Hours"" - it just doesnt feel right not to say something. -- Advisory Adult themes drug use.

It offers an easy opportunity for the maudlin to take over. But when grief is portrayed well as in Rabbit Hole it creates its own impact a rupture a jagged rip in the fabric between life before and life after which can never be the same. As the film opens that rupture has grown into a canyon between Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) who have lost their 4-year-old son four months prior. Like most information in David Lindsay-Abaires screenplay which he adapted from his own stage play the death and its circumstances are revealed gradually and patiently; Lindsay-Abaire has a gift for exposing plot details through dialogue and he writes characters strong enough to carry the burden.Both leads play to their strengths. Becca disenchanted with the platitudes of the support group she attends with her husband retreats into her own icy drift and Kidmans impassive elegance makes the perfect barrier between the character and the rest of the world. Howie borders on pretending that nothing happened as he tries to get on with life and Eckhart uses his nimble charisma to sell the illusion. The stars shine both in their muted attempts to break through to each other and in their arialike scenes of desperate emotion unleashed.They get plenty of help as well. The cast is dotted with fine supporting players including Sandra Oh as a grieving parent hooked on therapy; Dianne Wiest and Tammy Blanchard as Beccas mother and sister; and Miles Teller as the haunted guilt-ridden teen who with Becca creates a moving portrait of grace. Rabbit Hole reminds us how vital it is to cast well and deep beyond the starring roles especially in a compact film that can only go as far as its performances.Its an unusual film for John Cameron Mitchell known for bending gender in the gleeful drag rock opera Hedwig and the Angry Inch and stretching the boundaries of sexual content in Shortbus. Rabbit Hole is neither queer nor raunchy; by comparison to Mitchells previous work its rather bourgeois. It doesnt push any new formal ground.Instead it quietly goes about telling a disciplined story about a tough subject. Rabbit Hole seems an odd Christmas Day release; its not exactly full of holiday cheer. Then again perseverance can inspire and enlighten any time of the year. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Rather than bring them together mourning isolates them. Becca is angry and rigid a fist slamming the world. Howie is grief-stricken and slack wanting to be scraped up from the floor. He will not be her punching bag. She will not be his warm embrace. They will not comfort each other. She is inconsolable; he wants to be consoled. Their silence is deafening.And their dynamic is riveting. Employing minimalist means for maximum emotional impact Kidman and Eckhart are superlative. As Mitchell frames them they might illustrate Newtons Law of Emotion Every action of hers has an equal and opposite reaction in him.See Becca busy in the basement folding clothes belonging to her late son. She wants to pack up his effects and move on. Howie wants to stay put in the home that feels to Becca like a mausoleum. Howie benefits from and takes seriously a grief support group that for Becca is a farce. His default emotion is solicitousness; hers is snappishness. Disconnected from each other they each seek connection elsewhere Howie from a surrogate wife Becca from a surrogate son.Though his subject is heartbreak Mitchells destination is acceptance. His purpose leavens the emotional heaviness makes it bearable. So does Beccas lacerating anger which Kidman plays for black humor. It is the actress most engaged and emotionally layered work and a triumph for all involved.While Rabbit Hole the title of which refers to a graphic novel created by one of the characters may not be a cup of holiday cheer it is a most rewarding journey from the dark into the light.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Kidman Eckhart expertly transfer plays pain to screen - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Kidman Eckhart expertly transfer plays pain to screenRabbit Hole a 3 starsDecember 23 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticBased on his 2006 play a five-character one-set winner of the Pulitzer Prize screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaires ""Rabbit Hole"" retains what made it work on stage chiefly a disarming sense of humor amid the grimmest sort of personal crisis and a pair of juicy leading roles. The film directed by John Cameron Mitchell is conventionally made but extremely well-acted. It does what most stage-to-screen adaptations do not. It works. For Becca ( Nicole Kidman) and Howie ( Aaron Eckhart) the comfortable seemingly enviable Larchmont N.Y. couple at the collapsing center of the story life has become a prison as well as a prism refracting the fallout of what happened eight months earlier. Their 4-year-old boy ran out into the street chasing the family dog. A teenage driver struck the boy and killed him. Since then Howie has dealt with the loss his way through routines and group therapy and putting up a suspiciously hearty front. Becca meanwhile -- jobless almost affectless already having suffered the drug-related death of her brother perplexed emotionally about the news of her newly pregnant sister -- gropes toward solutions for insoluble problems. Is it better to hang onto to their sons fridge artwork or worse? When she sees an opportunity for communication with the boy behind the wheel months later should she take it? Or leave it? Lindsay-Abaires script juggles our sympathies with ease (though the quippy banter sometimes feels too easy too smooth). Several new characters are introduced among them a fellow grieving parent and a bit of a therapy junkie played by the reliably terrific Sandra Oh. Dianne Wiest plays Beccas mother a mass of good intentions and some weaker ones with a side of unresolved guilt. But this film belongs to Kidman who also produced and to Eckhart. By design the script saves its emotional fireworks for the climax and in extremis Mitchells film comes to unruly life. When Kidman and Eckhart are given a chance to unleash their demons after bottling them up too long the acting catches fire. Kidmans capable of real strength real emotion and real surprise and Eckhart finds the ideal mixture of fear and anger in his big scenes. Fierce and intuitive these actors are well-matched and well challenged. I suppose I wish Mitchell who made the more outre ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" and ""Shortbus"" had managed a more distinctive style and edge. The trappings are a little square from the musical score to the camera movement (or lack of it). God knows the subject matter scares moviegoers away more readily than theatergoers. But after languishing without a distributor for a while ""Rabbit Hole"" premiered in September at the Toronto International Film Festival. The word right away was better than expected. As is the movie. Kidman saw it through and she and Eckhart give it everything they have -- or rather everything they should give it. The rest they hold in reserve just as their characters do. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for mature thematic material some drug use and language) Cast Nicole Kidman (Becca); Aaron Eckhart (Howie); Dianne Wiest (Nat); Tammy Blanchard (Izzy); Miles Teller (Jason); Giancarlo Esposito (Auggie); Sandra Oh (Gabby) Credits Directed by John Cameron Mitchell; written by David Lindsay-Abaire based on his play; produced by Leslie Urdang Dean Vanech Nicole Kidman Per Saari and Gigi Pritzker.

Rabbit Hole Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2010) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rabbit-hole-2010,200,rabbithole18,rabbithole,rogerebert
"Rabbit Hole | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rabbit-hole ) Rabbit Hole (United States 2010) December 22 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Numerous movies about grief miss the mark by a wide margin sliding down a slippery slope of schlocky melodrama with overacting performers failing to convince us that their tears are real. Every once in a while however a film gets it right. In the Bedroom is one example. Rabbit Hole is another. Uncompromising painful and at times difficult to watch this movie lays bare more than a few raw nerves. Some viewers will find it too real too immediate. Its an experience to be sure but I wouldnt classify it as entertainment. Those who venture into Rabbit Hole with their expectations properly aligned will leave fulfilled and perhaps with a slightly different perspective on a few things. The setup is simple. It has been eight months since Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) lost their four-year old son Danny in a traffic accident. His dog ran into the street and without looking Danny followed. He was struck by a car driven by teenager Jason (Miles Teller). For Becca and Howie the wound has scabbed over but not healed and the unexpected pregnancy of Beccas sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard) threatens to exacerbate the injury. Becca lives in a frosty cocoon of denial. Howie believes she is trying to ""erase"" Danny from their lives much as she erased a video of him from Howies smart phone. She removes Dannys clothing from the house. She gives Dannys dog to her mother. She stops attending a support group. She calls God ""sadistic"" and sneers at those who turn to religion for comfort. She will not have sex or consider the possibility of another child. And she begins stalking Jason seeking some kind of connection that even she doesnt understand. For his part Howie appears to have adjusted at least to a degree. He has passed through more stages of grief than his wife but he still suffers from bouts of anger and depression. As the gulf between Becca and Howie grows he gravitates toward fellow support group member Gaby (Sandra Oh) whose husband has recently left her. When he tells her that he loves his wife we wonder if he means the Becca of old or the Becca of now. There are things in life that change us and once we experience them theres no going back. If we were to travel through time and meet the individuals we once were it would be like encountering other people. Having a child may be the most transformative experience a person can experience. Losing that child is a close second. Parents invest so much into the care nurturing and upbringing of their offspring that if the child dies the resulting chasm seems bottomless. Life cannot be what it once was. Death is not a time machine that allows us to return to the carefree days of pre-parenthood. Its a wound that cuts deeply and leaves a scar. It shakes the foundations of even the sturdiest marriages. People react differently to tragedy and in the midst of grief a mutual sense of intolerance can create a gap that can be intimidating to span. Many marriages collapse after the death of a child. Watching Becca and Howie its not hard to understand why this is the case. Before it became a movie Rabbit Hole existed as a play. Written with brilliant perceptiveness by David Linday-Abaire it won the Pulitzer Prize and earned actress Cynthia Nixon a Tony. John Cameron Mitchell (Shortbus Hedwig and the Angry Inch) whom one might not naturally associate with this sort of non-escapist drama was attracted to the project because it spoke to him. His direction is understated and he is supported by several sterling performances. Chief among those is Nicole Kidmans. She digs deep to find Beccas wellspring of pain and brings it to the screen with an intensity that is at times difficult to watch. We not only believe her loss but we feel how it is destroying her and her family. Aaron Eckhart is nearly as good although he goes a little over-the-top during the blowup that illustrates how far apart Howie and Becca have drifted. In a supporting role as Beccas mother Dianne Wiest has several wonderful moments. The movie is not about Dannys death. With the one exception the narrative is flashback-free remaining in the present and advancing linearly. This is about the difficulty of recovery even months after the fact. Many people ascribe a time table to grief but its impact can be so subtle and pernicious that it continues to eat at the soul long after its most obvious effects have faded. Rabbit Hole is about how the enormity of the loss of a child short-circuits everything reducing lifes colors to grays and the experience of living to a chore. The movie has some minor missteps in tone (the aforementioned argument between Becca and Howie is jarring with Eckhart too obviously acting) but represents one of the best explorations of this kind of grief I have seen represented on screen. It is not patronizing and more importantly it is not manipulative. The honesty is stark and will make Rabbit Hole challenging for some and sobering for others. It tells its story with respect and openness and offers a catharsis at the end. That may not always happen in real life but in a movie where we have come to empathize with the characters its the right approach.

The title alludes to a damaged teenagers self-penned comic book which describes a universe of parallel time lines and multiple realities; and on a narrative level it resolves nothing. Itas the least banal solace imaginable. John Cameron Mitchells film of Rabbit Hole (from a screenplay by Lindsay-Abaire) is very fine. Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart play Becca and Howie Corbett an affluent New York suburban couple still dazed after eight months from a tragic loss. The details of that event are revealed in tiny installments a striptease that in other works (21 Grams e.g.) can be noxious but here makes you watch whats in front of you more closely. Broadly speaking Howie is willfully stubbornly stuck. Back from the office he turns to old home videos the way junkies reach for the needle. He wants to stay in that enormous house and leave everything just as it was. But Becca who left her job when she had a son and has little to do now gropes her way toward the next stage of grief aware that if she stays where she is something in her will die. Alas I missed Rabbit Hole onstage with Cynthia Nixon and John Slattery but did see Lindsay-Abaires absurdist Fuddy Meers which also centered on a wifes bumpy journey to enlightenment and had an aspect of Alice in Wonderland. Fuddy Meers was satire with a vein of despair; Rabbit Hole is drama with a vein of satire. Becca comes from a working-class Long Island family with a history of drug abuse and dysfunction. Her job at Sothebys her marriage her move to an affluent suburb her beautiful home with a beautiful son and a big dog It has all melted into air. Yet her new world is incapable of acknowledging death. As has been observed elsewhere Kidman has apparently regained the use of her forehead -- and the improvement is not just cosmetic. When actors get ""immobile"" they sever (or at very least dull) the link between their features and emotions. In Australia Kidman had the expressive range of The Wizard of Ozs Tin Woodsman; you could almost hear the actress inside her whimpering ""Oil can ... "" It mattered because there was an actress inside her -- and because her entire career had been until that point a quest to overcome a certain Barbie Doll blankness. Such self-sabotage The Kidman in Rabbit Hole is a revelation. She has chosen shrewdly to underline two things Beccas righteous anger and the awareness that her anger isnt going to take her very far. At a painfully sensitive grief therapy meeting she bridles and then snaps when a father asserts that what happened to his child was ""Gods will."" She lashes out at her mother (Dianne Wiest) who lost a much older child under vastly different circumstances and tries to tell Becca that the tragedies were comparable. In Kidmans face you see a woman who has no idea what to do but knows she must do something. Thats when by chance she looks into a school bus at a stoplight and sees the teenager Jason (Miles Teller) who changed her world forever. What happens between Becca and Jason is too fragile to chart and there is perhaps a touch of wish fulfillment at work in Lindsay-Abaires writing. But in his minefield of a role Teller is wonderful -- first off-putting then irrationally likable. His Jason is in shock and likely to remain so -- and also to remain half-formed arrested at a stage in which hes likely never to find himself. When playwrights ""open out"" their plays for the screen they often break up and pad out their poetry to the point where it becomes prose but Lindsay-Abaire and Cameron Mitchell have been able to move Becca and Howie around without dulling the dramatic arc. (They go off key in only one scene in which Becca objects to a mother rebuking her child in a supermarket.) Theres a great irreverent vibe in the scenes between Eckharts Howie and Sandra Oh as a mother in the grief group They get stoned in a car and burst out laughing when they hear the word ""leukemia."" Eckart is howlingly funny in a scene in which Howie shows the house to prospective buyers and cant keep from enthusing about his childs hovering presence He has a glint of madness. Beneath its tidy surface Rabbit Hole depicts a universe in which nothing makes sense nothing fits in which our best consolation is the dream of a world on the other side of a black hole -- the one variation out of billions in which everything in our life falls into place.

"Review Kidman shines in painfully honest Rabbit Hole - CNN.com Part of complete coverage on Holiday Movies Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Review Kidman shines in painfully honest Rabbit Hole By Tom Charity Special to CNN Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart star as a couple who must grapple with the loss of their child. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNicole Kidman stars in the new film ""Rabbit Hole""Reviewer praises her performance as a mother whose child dies in an accidentThe film which also stars Aaron Eckhart is adapted from an award-winning play RELATED TOPICS Nicole Kidman Movies Movie Reviews Entertainment (CNN) -- Sometimes things happen in life that knock you right off the path you had mapped out for yourself and send you reeling. Its only when youre outside in the dark that you look back and see that the safety zone you always took for granted wasnt a safe zone at all -- just a temporary reprieve from disaster. At least thats how it appears from that vantage point. Then the question arises how to get back in? How to recover from an irreparable loss? This is where Becca and Howie Corbett find themselves -- still outside looking in -- a year after their 4-year-old was struck and killed by a passing car. The accident wasnt anybodys fault; it was everybodys fault. They dont blame each other; they both blame themselves. Their marriage has grown thorns. Its raw abrasive and hurts so much they can barely find the energy to maintain a truce behind closed doors. But then the alternative is even more painful too disturbing to contemplate. David Lindsay-Abaires Tony- and Pulitzer-winning play forces us to think about a scenario no parent wants to imagine. It comes to the screen through the patronage of Nicole Kidman who gets a producer credit here as well as one of those rare movie roles that can draw her out of her shell. Kidman is an intriguing case a star who can seem trapped beneath her brittle porcelain beauty but who has also ventured further and wider than most taking on risky uncommercial projects like ""Dogville"" ""Birth"" and the Diane Arbus movie ""Fur."" The last time she found a role this layered it was the monstrous writer in ""Margot at the Wedding"" a part she played so ruthlessly audiences practically ran screaming for the exits. This time at least she can be sure of engaging our sympathies even if the material is too depressing to bring in large crowds. Beccas actions can be cruel. Shes cold with Howie (Aaron Eckhart -- also excellent) cant disguise her contempt for group therapy (she quits before they throw her out) and she mortifies her husband when she gives away their sons wardrobe without a word of warning. She keeps her emotions locked tight. But unlike Howie we can see what it costs her having those clothes in the house. When she starts stalking the teenager who killed her boy (Miles Teller) we have no way of knowing which way shell jump -- its an irrational urge that Kidman makes utterly and immediately human. iReporter Remarkable ""Rabbit Hole"" The director is John Cameron Mitchell a filmmaker previously known for the assertively camp ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" and the bohemian rhapsody ""Shortbus."" ""Rabbit Hole"" is a complete about-face a modest restrained introspective piece so self-effacing you wonder if it might be the work of some other John Cameron Mitchell -- his boring straight father perhaps? Its not all roses. I never believed Kidmans polished Becca was related by blood to Dianne Wiest or Tammy Blanchard (as her embarrassing mother and screw-up sister respectively) and though the relationship between Becca and the teenager develops with delicacy and tact it still feels a bit precious and stagy. Much better is the heartrending tragic-comic scene when Eckharts Howie takes it upon himself to show the house to prospective buyers only to fall apart when they come to the nursery. In a handful of moments like this the irreproachably compassionate ""Rabbit Hole"" isnt just well written and beautifully acted its simply devastating.

Becca Corbett lost her 4-year-old boy. And so far her coping strategy has been not to cope at all. Its been nine months since the accident. Her time apart from him has lasted nearly as long as the time he spent inside her. Yet theres no end to the grieving because shes afraid to let it truly begin. So she pushes away the memories. Changes the subject. Keeps herself busy. Sits through that dealing-with-grief group her husband drags her to arms defiantly crossed. And tries not to face the fact that Dannys funeral buried her too. Becca is the heroine of the unsparing ""Rabbit Hole"" and spending an hour and a half in her company is a challenge. She pushes her husband away and snipes at her mother and sister. Shes angry. Shes rude. She doesnt act the way she ""should"" act. She acts the way people do. Movie Review Rabbit Hole (PG-13) Lionsgate (94 min.) Directed by John Cameron Mitchell. With Nicole Kidman Aaron Eckhart Dianne Wiest. Now playing in New York; scheduled to open in New Jersey Jan. 14. Rating note The film contains strong language and drug use. Stephen Whittys Review THREE AND A HALF STARS A Pulitzer Prize winner ""Rabbit Hole"" also won a Tony for original Broadway star Cynthia Nixon. Youd think Nixon would have used some of that ""Sex and the City"" money to buy up the rights and ensure that she starred in the movie version as well. Yet you never regret that Nicole Kidman ended up being the actress who got this made. Kidman has always had a chilly beauty her great breakthrough coming when she used that icy reserve (and exploited some peoples cynical roman-a-clef assumptions) to play the cool anything-to-get-ahead wife of ""To Die For."" Lately though shes tended toward messier women her increasingly masklike countenance belying their roiling emotions. Shes back to playing another queen of control here. Except ironically the tamped-down Becca isnt really in charge of anything -- least of all her own life. Keeping Becca at the heart of the story is the work of screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire whos deftly adapted his play. The work of director John Cameron Mitchell too whose last two films -- the flashy ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" and fleshy ""Shortbus"" -- hardly prepare you for the calm focus and clear storytelling here. But while Becca is the heart shes not the only character. There is her mostly decent husband Aaron Eckhart who finds his own way to grieve and makes his own mistakes. There is her underestimated mother Dianne Wiest whose wisdom her daughter cant bear to hear. But mostly there is Kidman who thrillingly mixes fire and ice her burning sarcasm only occasionally doused by her obsession with useless detail (the flowers in her backyard must be planted just so the creme brulee properly lovingly caramelized). She is not an easy woman to like -- there is no reason why she should be -- nor is this an easy movie to watch especially if youre a parent or even just in a relationship. Because Becca and her husband arent bad people. In fact theyre rather good people. But a tragic loss has taken them down the rabbit hole. And where they have ended up is an upside-down land where you only lose the things you cant afford to and only truly hurt the people you most adore.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 17 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Dec. 16 2010 346PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Dont go down this Rabbit Hole unless you wish to see a superb film that treats a sad topic with unflinching honesty. Dont go down this Rabbit Hole unless you believe that tragedys grief when transmuted through arts protective lens can feel liberating even joyful in its painful truths. And dont go down unless youve harboured if only fleetingly the heretical notion that God can be a sadistic bully and Santa a jolly despot. Otherwise fall freely down and watch what wells up. For a parent the tragedy at issue is the worst imaginable - to be predeceased by your child. Heres what we dont see on camera but soon know Eight months ago in a happy suburban home the family dog darted out of the front yard and a young boy followed - right into the path of an oncoming car. By every objective assessment the fatality was an ""accident"" but that weak word has in this context potent ramifications. It just means that no one is to blame but everyone feels guilty. In the aftermath of such a death the emotional debris is permanent - grief and guilt are glass shards that time will never sweep away. Our first sight of Becca the bereft mother is in her garden. Detached deliberate shes planting flowers in pale imitation of that other more profound nurturing. Here and throughout Nicole Kidman plays her with a brittleness hard yet fragile that sometimes erupts into anger or caustic wit but that always keeps her at a remove from the world as if her private nightmare is an enclosing reality separate from the public life that goes so blithely on around her. Still she functions she endures as does the relationship with her husband Howie (an equally impressive Aaron Eckhart). Theirs is clearly a solid marriage with abundant sensitivity on each side and yet within it a vast shared love has been lost gone irrevocably. How can mere romantic love possibly fill that vacuum? The answer is short It cant. So in an effort to cope both parents have plunged down different rabbit holes into ""parallel universes"" of their own devising. The rest of the film tracks them on their distinct journeys deep into dark places where just possibly parallel lines might intersect. In Howies realm familiarity is a solace and he clings to his sons memory in the drawings on the fridge door in the video obsessively replayed on his cellphone in the house itself even in the blameless dog. But in Beccas universe his source of comfort is her circle of hell Give the clothes away ship the toys out let them be as far off as their owner. Nor does she unlike him have any patience for the ""professional wallowers"" in group therapy especially those who treat their grief with the balm of religion. When a fellow sufferer asserts ""God needed another angel"" Becca snaps back coldly ""Then why didnt He just make one?"" Heaven too is a parallel universe but its definitely not on her itinerary of belief. Inevitably husband and wife drift into secrets kept from each other - he into a potential liaison with another woman (Sandra Oh) she into furtive meetings with the teenage driver of that fatal car (Miles Teller). As they do director John Cameron Mitchell and writer David Lindsay-Abaire adapting his own stage play team together deftly to ""open up"" the piece for the screen. There it looks organically at home especially through a succession of two-person scenes whose raw candour fuels the films escalating drama Becca with the teenager who nurses his own guilt; Becca with her maladroit but well-meaning mother (Dianne Wiest); and climactically Becca with Howie their mutual sympathy shattered in an outburst of verbal violence punctuated by a deadly calm with nothing left to be said. Only in that terrible silence do they really communicate. Only then do their parallel paths intersect but just to compound one tragedy with another. Around them of course the world spins and renews itself no more so than when Beccas fun-loving sister breezily announces that shes pregnant. But that cruel parallelism seems a bit forced one of the few false notes in an otherwise affecting symphony. However its quickly redeemed by a remarkable sequence when griefs big question is posed - ""Does it ever go away?"" - and meets with this unvarnished reply ""No. But it changes the weight of it. It turns into something you can carry around like a brick in your pocket. Its what youve got instead of your son."" Thats an astonishing insight Grief morphs from an awful burden to a familiar companion and that very familiarity becomes its own form of solace. Astonishing too and just as moving is the symphonys coda when for the first time the idea of moving ahead is tentatively embraced. Mitchell shows the future as a flash-forward but its narrated in voiceover in the present. So today is speculating about tomorrow with another big question - ""And then what?"" - meeting with another unvarnished reply ""I dont know. Something though."" Those who are happy today cling to the predictability of tomorrow; those who arent cling even harder to that unknown little ""something"" - its their everything.

It is directed by John Cameron Mitchell from David Lindsay-Abaires play. (Everett Collection) Joe Neumaier Friday December 17 2010 400 AM Title Rabbit Hole A couple flail after their young son is killed. With Nicole Kidman Aaron Eckhart. Director John Cameron Mitchell (132). PG Language. At Landmark Sunshine and Lincoln Square.As a woman deafened by the silence around Nicole Kidman stoops in the dirt and tends her flowers reverently in ""Rabbit Hole"" a sure sign of movie-made melancholy.She grasps pruner and shovel scoops the dirt and plants the movies flag of seriousness where everyone can see it.Directed by John Cameron Mitchell from David Lindsay-Abaires Pulitzer-winning play ""Rabbit Hole"" makes good use of Kidman and Aaron Eckhart in roles originated on Broadway by Cynthia Nixon and John Slattery. The characters unbearable grief is tempered by Kidmans thoughtful beauty and Eckharts big-grinned buoyancy and any honesty here is due to them.Becca (Kidman) and Howie Corbett (Eckhart) shamble through their Connecticut house months after their toddler son was hit by a car. Becca cold and efficient wants to take down their sons drawings while recoiling from intimacy or events. Howie pushes for grief counseling and finds comfort in the evidence of their pre-accident life -- photos videos art.As Howie flirts with Gaby (Sandra Oh) a survivors group member Becca follows Jason (Miles Teller) the high schooler responsible for her sons death. Her talks with him are awkward at first but then maternal and the quiet teen shows her a graphic novel hes working on in which alternate universes -- rabbit holes -- let unhappy people be themselves again.We see glimpses of that book and of Howies forced conversations with office co-workers and desperate connection with Gaby. But the crux of the story is the back-and-forth between this upper-middle-class couple who lost their balance and reason for being.Mitchell and cinematographer Frank G. DeMarco light the domestic scenes with a dull sterility and exteriors carry a sense of foreboding. The actors seem out of place in each Outdoors Kidman lacks control; Eckhart seems trapped as he walks through rooms.That subtle physicality along with the two strong actors heartbreaking attempts to have their approach to grief win out keeps ""Rabbit Hole"" from TV movie territory. But too much else is contrived especially Beccas glimpses into Jasons world. Seeing the young man go to his prom as she sits weeping in her car for a son who wont have that day Kidman is able to draw you in even as the movies solemn morbid obviousness wears you out.

David Geisbrecht/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption David Geisbrecht/Lionsgate Rabbit Hole Director John Cameron Mitchell Genre Drama Running Time 91 minutes Rated PG-13 With Nicole Kidman Aaron Eckhart Sandra Oh Dianne Wiest Tammy Blanchard (Recommended) Watch Clips From Rabbit Hole - He Needed Another Angel He Needed Another Angel Credit Lionsgate From Rabbit Hole - Cinnamon Buns Cinnamon Buns Credit Lionsgate On paper John Cameron Mitchell who brought us the raucous utterly dear Hedwig and the Angry Inch and the sexually adventurous Shortbus is the last person to take on a straight-ahead domestic drama. Here he is nonetheless with Rabbit Hole about an ordinary couple riding the waves of a loss thats no less terrible for being as common as dust. Yet star and co-producer Nicole Kidman chose boldly and well when she signed Mitchell to direct her production companys first picture. He brings respect tenderness and a generous helping of his antic wit to Rabbit Hole not to mention a rare gift for adding visual radiance to a talky stage play. Nimbly adapted by David Lindsay-Abaire from his Pulitzer Prize-winning play the movie both mimics and slyly violates the stately TV-movie plod through stages of grief to a hard-won but inevitable serenity. Theres nothing tidy about the fraying marriage of Howie (Aaron Eckhart) and Becca (Kidman) a well-heeled couple reeling from the accidental death of their 4-year-old son. Mitchell keeps the pace leisurely and the tone muted but an abyss of incomprehension and resentment opens up between the two as they stagger through their polarized responses to the tragedy. While Howie tries to hang on to every reminder of his son obsessively replaying home videos on his cell phone Becca seeks to erase all traces of the boy. She puts away his clothes removes his drawings from the refrigerator and lashes out at any unfortunate who offers consoling bromides. In Kidmans precisely calibrated rendition of a woman quietly unraveling we see that Becca was never the easy partner in this marriage; loss has simply brought out a bitch in her whom Mitchell plainly enjoys. She despises their bereavement group -- a scene there provides an occasion for Mitchell to pull out the irreverent stops -- and while Howie diligently shows up for its meetings Becca takes to stalking the sweet fatherless Jason (touching newcomer Miles Teller) a teen whos tortured by uncertainty about his culpability in her sons death. i Dianne Wiest plays Beccas mother Nat; the two get closer in the wake of Beccas sons death. Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Lionsgate Dianne Wiest plays Beccas mother Nat; the two get closer in the wake of Beccas sons death. Lionsgate With his shifty eyes his thin compressed lips and his gym-sculpted body Eckhart is hardly an intuitive choice to play a decent bewildered Everyman. But he rises beautifully to the occasion playing off Kidmans acidic outbursts until Howie too veers off the rails -- though in his own direction. Barely managing the unevenly rocking boats of their separate sorrow Howie and Becca cling for dear destructive life to their clandestine excursions. No wonder Becca is fascinated by Jasons comic-book ventures into parallel universes. Mitchell shores up these two strong leads with a well-oiled ensemble from which the incomparable Dianne Wiest stands out a vision in lumpy cardigans as Beccas flighty but worldly-wise mother. A matter-of-fact Sandra Oh also shines as a multiply bereaved mom from ""group"" who offers Howie a bong and other kinds of balm to soothe his grief. Mitchell and Lindsay-Abaire never overplay their hands never reach for the cathartic wallow. Things boil over frequently but quietly in Rabbit Hole and in getting everyone to underplay (Anton Sankos minimalist score sustains the tact) Mitchell at once heightens the drama and brings it closer to the eternal incompleteness of life. Rabbit Hole redefines ""healing"" not by banishing loss but by having its characters own it then carefully place one foot in front of the other until life can be resumed or rebuilt with the pain contained. Watching Howie and Beccas struggle I was reminded of a cherishable tragic-comic line in Hedwig whose transgender rock singer declares of his brutally mutilated member -- the result of a botched sex-change operation -- ""Its what I have to work with."" Beccas grief is what she now has to work with and though Rabbit Hole tells a familiar tale its goofy loving feel for human cruelty and rage for kindness and breakthrough bursts of exuberance lifts this lovely chamber piece high above the crowd.

ABOUT THE MOVIERabbit Hole   1/2 (out of four)Stars Nicole Kidman Aaron Eckhart Dianne Weist Sandra Oh Giancarlo EspositoDirector John Cameron MitchellDistributor LionsgateRating PG-13 for mature thematic material some drug use and languageRunning time 1 hour 31 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Rabbit Hole is a finely tuned portrait of grief that takes its time unfolding much like the actual process of mourning. Nicole Kidman does some of her best most nuanced work as Becca a brittle but complicated mother mourning the loss of her young son. Aaron Eckhart who plays her loving husband Howie is more open about his suffering burrowing into familiarity while Becca tries to distance herself and bury turbulent emotions in calming acts of domesticity. Her despair seeps out in unexpected ways. INTERVIEW Nicole Kidman hops back into limelight TRAILER Get a peek into Rabbit Hole Both Beccas and Howies reactions are wholly understandable authentic expressions of their characters which are well-developed and delicately shaded. They retreat to their separate corners when the anguish becomes unbearable. When they do come together he laments that Becca is ""erasing"" their boy by removing his photos and giving away his clothes. She strikes back saying he makes it seem shes not ""feeling enough"" to satisfy him. Deftly directed by John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch) these wrenching scenes ring deeply true. As moving as Kidman and Eckhart are in this low-key graceful domestic drama the standout performance is a subtly poignant one by Miles Teller. He plays Jason the teenage boy who while driving inadvertently kills Becca and Howies son. His face is etched with remorse and his halting unlikely friendship with Becca is the highlight of the story the twist that makes this tale unique from other stories of unimaginable loss. Teller is brilliantly awkward as only a 17-year-old boy in this terrible situation could be. Becca is yearning for a way to make sense of a tragedy that can never be fully absorbed. By making a tentative connection with this particular teenager you sense how complicated her torment is. She is trying to hold on to her son take a step toward forgiveness and perhaps also imagine through this older boy what her child might have grown up to be like. Its heartbreaking on so many levels. Another stellar performance is that of Dianne Weist as Beccas warmhearted mother. Their relationship feels genuine as they come together in fits and starts. Prickly Becca lashes out and her emotional mother retreats into hurt feelings. One scene perfectly captures the films essence. During a mundane household task Becca asks her mother whose 30-year-old son died of heroin addiction if the pain of losing a child ever goes away. ""No"" her mother tells her with aching honesty. ""It changes. The weight of it. At some point it becomes bearable and you forget about it for a while. But its what youve got instead of your son so you carry it around."" Rabbit Hole is profound and superbly acted with a moving script superbly adapted from David Lindsay-Abaires Pulitzer-winning play. Mercifully there are no sappy Hollywood moments injected into this spare drama. Amid the melancholy there is a glimmer of resilience and a hope for redemption that feels hard-won.

"Rabbit Hole Viewing life through a tunnel of grief | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRabbit Hole Viewing life through a tunnel of griefRabbit Hole sees a world that is trying to be ordered and nice. Meanwhile life just goes on in its maddeningly disorganized and brutal fashion.Nicole Kidman left and Aaron Eckhart star ub Rabbit Hole.  (AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 16 2010 Rabbit Hole (out of 4) Starring Nicole Kidman Aaron Eckhart Dianne Wiest Miles Teller and Sandra Oh. Directed by John Cameron Mitchell. 92 minutes. At the Varsity. 14A Becca (Nicole Kidman) isnt coping with the car-accident death eight months ago of her young son Danny and who says she should? Just about everybody around her. Her practical husband Howie (Aaron Eckhart) wants Becca to resume living. He wants her to attend group sessions with other bereaved parents. He wants her to have sex with him again -- perhaps to conceive another child? Beccas sturdy mother Nat (Dianne Wiest) reminds her daughter that she also lost a son Beccas brother Arthur and she got over it. Sure Arthur was 30 and a heroin addict; Danny was just four when he fatally chased the family dog into the street. ""But he was still my son"" mom says. Then theres Beccas sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard) who has repeatedly screwed up her life yet is delighted to discover shes pregnant. Why cant Becca just be happy for her? And so it goes in Rabbit Hole a perceptive and sympathetic film by John Cameron Mitchell that looks at grief by way of selfish reasonableness. Of course Howie Nat and Izzy are right but who sets the time limit on healing a heart? Why does Becca have to ""get over"" something she still doesnt understand or accept? The movie is a mature statement by Mitchell whose previous films Shortbus and Hedwig and the Angry Inch took sex as lifes major preoccupation. Working with a sensitive script by David Lindsay-Abaire who adapts his own stage play Mitchell isnt out to grind axes or assign blame. Hes just observing what happens when perfectly ordered lives on an immaculate New York suburban street are suddenly torn asunder. Often that observing mimics the rabbit of the title and the skittishness of Becca the camera peers from below through small nooks and crannies as if wondering if its safe to come out. Composer Anton Sankos beautifully understated score rich in piano strings and flute mirrors the mood of longing and grim forbearance. Just one person seems to be feeling as much grief as Becca. Its Jason (Miles Teller) the teenager who drove the car that killed Danny an event we see in flashback well into the movie. It wasnt really Jasons fault; it all happened so quickly. But he was behind the wheel. Jason is a high schooler with an affinity for art and science fiction. Hes sketching panels for a homemade comic book he calls Rabbit Hole. One carefully sketched image seen throughout the film reveals disembodied heads amidst a cacophony of trumpets. Everybodys talking at him too. Becca begins stalking Jason seeking answers to questions she still hasnt formed. Its an outstanding performance by Kidman who fully opens her heart to a role that plainly speaks to her deepest fears. You could imagine Becca as an older and wiser version of Kidmans judgmental Margot from Margot at the Wedding shes learned through tragedy that life isnt as predictable or controllable as she had thought. Kidman is an obvious candidate for Best Actress honors at the Academy Awards but the supporting cast is stellar. Wiest and Eckhart smother grief with sensibility yet their capacity for hurt comes through. And newcomer Teller has a bright future ahead of him. Rabbit Hole sees a world that is trying to be ordered and nice -- but as Becca curtly observes ""Things arent nice anymore."" Life just goes on in its maddeningly disorganized and brutal fashion. All thats left is the passage of time and the hope that healing might come with it.

Disney Enterprises By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 17 2010 1201 a.m. ET Breathes there a movie with soul so dead as ""TRON Legacy?"" Well ""Speed Racer"" lumbers to mind. That was a nightmare vision of entertainment in the digital age though the cast did include a pet chimp that mugged for its close-ups. Disneys ponderous sequel to the 1982 ""TRON"" bets the whole silicon-based farm--a budget of at least 170 million plus megamarketing costs--on a video-game esthetic that apes the look of Steven Lisbergers original but adds precious little humanity to the visually spectacular 3-D remix. (The new version which is also being shown in 3-D IMAX was directed by Joseph Kosinksi; its his first feature film.) Watch a clip from ""Tron Legacy"" starring Jeff Bridges. When ""TRON"" came to the screen almost three decades ago it was widely admired for its trailblazing use of computer graphics and for the bright spirit of its intricate video-game mythology. Other films most notably ""Star Wars"" had already employed digital effects on a comparatively small scale but ""TRON"" took audiences to a computer-generated world called the Grid in the company of Jeff Bridgess video-game designer Kevin Flynn who got sucked into the virtual environment he had created. By the end of the film Kevin had managed to escape back into the real world. When ""TRON Legacy"" gets under way though he has been missing for 20 years. Thats because as the trailers have already revealed he got himself trapped once again in the perilous land of bits and bytes so its up to his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund) to rescue him. Sams entry into the digital domain is staged poetically with the classic fantasy element of a secret door and an opening up from 2-D to 3-D that evokes the transition from black and white to Technicolor in the preface of ""The Wizard of Oz."" No sooner than ""TRON Legacy"" opens up though it starts to freeze up with one feeling-free sequence after another A reception committee of what seem to be robotic Playboy bunnies with Light Discs on their backs instead of tails; a vast expanse a la ""Triumph of the Will"" of faceless soldiers representing computer programs; an outbreak of brainlessly repetitive Light Disc combat; a succession of eye-popping ear-shattering and brain-numbing races on neon-trimmed Light Cycles. (Daft Punk did the soundtrack which achieves a loud grandeur that the film reaches for but mostly misses.) Light is a motif here but there isnt much of it given the films slavish adherence to original blacks and dark blues. (Would the fan base have been outraged by a slight expansion of the visual spectrum?) Nor is there much fun in the real-world sense of the term except for a gleefully campy turn by Michael Sheen as a program called Castor--basically a nightclub owner--who warns Sam that he is about to cross the Sea of Simulation and its ""going to be quite a ride."" The whole thing is a sea of sensory stimulation a deadly efficient machine for merchandising toys video games theme-park rides and yes even movie tickets. The film discharges its stylistic debts to its source material with rigid devotion while offering a few surprises along the way. The best of them involve Mr. Bridges who plays not only Kevin Flynn and Clu the computer program he created but Kevin at two stages of life represented in the two films--as the father Sam has been searching for a sort of defeated hippie elder who has settled for a passive life with his Lycra-clad acolyte Quorra (Olivia Wilde); and as a 30-something man with a Jeff Bridges face youthened by the same digital techniques that aged Brad Pitt in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" (The illusion is remarkable except for the mouth which looks more than artfully animated but less than fully human.) A message lies in old Kevins rueful admission ""I screwed it up chasing after perfection."" Yet the larger message of ""TRON Legacy"" is that ""TRON""s legacy is nothing more than technological a razzle-dazzle display of effects that are far more special than they were in 1982 but cold effects nevertheless. Its dispiriting to see how little attention the filmmakers have paid to the dramatic--read human--possibilities of the original or how much theyve been overwhelmed by technologys demands. Its as though rogue programs took over the production. Watch a clip from ""Rabbit Hole"" starring Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart. Rabbit Hole Nicole Kidman places the bereaved heroine of ""Rabbit Hole"" in a nether land between life and not-quite-life. Her beautiful performance transcends the specifics of the script which David Lindsay-Abaire adapted from his play of the same name. (The film was directed by John Cameron Mitchell.) Ms. Kidmans Becca and Aaron Eckharts Howie have lost their only child to a random accident; the little boy was struck by a car while chasing his dog. Howie copes with his grief--as much as anyone can cope with such grief--by clinging to every trace of their sons life. Becca in her turn wants to banish all reminders and sell their suburban New York house. Thats the schematic part of their parallel lives. The haunting part is how Becca moves through her days. She drives she does laundry she smiles on occasion and jogs on her treadmill but shes elusive to herself as well as others a spirit in transit to unknown parts. ENLARGE Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart as grieving parents in Rabbit Hole. Lionsgate The script has many specifics to transcend; its a single-minded construction that excludes most countercurrents. The couple seeks solace in a support group. A child seat still occupies its customary place in the back of their sedan. Beccas mother Nat (Dianne Wiest) talks constantly about the death of her drug-addicted son Beccas brother. Howie keeps old videos of his vanished son on his phone and watches them obsessively. Yet the most affecting moments are the oblique ones when Howie reconnects with his dog; when Becca reconnects obsessively but courageously with the neighborhood boy who drove the fateful car; when the boy who is played with sweet simplicity by Miles Teller reveals his own struggle to understand death and loss; and when Becca toward the end speculates on some of the things that she and Howie might say at a party. In doing so shes rehearsing for the possibility of happiness. ENLARGE Reese Witherspoon and Owen Wilson are a couple in How Do You Know. Columbia Pictures How Do You Know No need to belabor the awfulness of this film a romantic comedy devoid of romance--instead of chemistry theres the flow of reverse magnetism--and lacking in comic timing let alone comic content. Reese Witherspoon is Lisa a recently prominent womens softball player whose career has begun to decline. She must choose between her boyfriend Matty a major-league pitcher played by Owen Wilson and Paul Rudds George a major-league corporation executive who may have to take the fall for his larcenous father. (That crudely written role is played grotesquely by Jack Nicholson.) Though romantic comedy is the chosen genre of ""How Do You Know"" mysteries surface at every turn. Why are so many scenes so clumsy in their depiction of clumsy behavior? Why is the photography so overbright and ugly? Why dont we learn the specific reason for Georges indictment? Why cant we see at least a fragment of one of Mattys games? Why cant Lisa see that Matty is a charmless narcissistic lout? Most mysterious of all--and this isnt belaboring its expressing real bafflement--how could this sloppy sluggish production have been written and directed by James L. Brooks the man who gave us such memorable films as ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Broadcast News""? The title refers to matters of the heart how do you know youre in love? But it could refer just as well to cinematic quality. How do you know a movie is a total loss? When you watch it with a heavy heart and sit through it like a stone. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) ENLARGE Never has Jeff Bridges been a stronger presence or Beau Bridges a more touching one than in Steve Klovess masterful debut as a writer-director. (He wrote and directed only one other feature ""Flesh and Bone"" before adapting all but one of the Harry Potter films to date.) The two brothers play Jack and Frank Baker musician brothers with a lounge act in need of new energy. Thats provided by Michelle Pfeiffers Susie Diamond an insouciant singer with a sultry voice. (Ms. Pfeiffer did her own singing live and every measure is a treat.) The Others (2001) In this supernatural thriller set in a fogbound mansion on the Isle of Jersey Nicole Kidmans Grace waits for her soldier husband to come home from World War II. Poor Grace has a lot to contend with. Her young daughter and son are in contact with resident ghosts. Whats more the kids seem to be severely photosensitive so Grace protects them by shutting windows and doors like some crazed deputy of the light police. Alejandro Amenabar directed from his own script. The script has problems but Ms. Kidman plays her role with impressive intensity. Walk the Line (2005) Reese Witherspoon won an Oscar for her performance as June Carter opposite Joaquin Phoenixs Johnny Cash. He takes charge of his role slowly but surely and then superbly. Shes been celebrated for previous roles--contemporary comic acting doesnt get any better than what she did in ""Election"" or ""Legally Blonde""--but her work as Cashs beloved wife is still startling for its humor verve and intelligence. James Mangold directed this excellent biographical film from an adaptation that he and Gill Dennis based on two Johnny Cash books ""Man in Black"" and ""Cash The Autobiography."" --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Movie review Rabbit Hole - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Rabbit HoleNicole Kidman brings remarkable empathy to the role of a mother coping with the death of her young son but the movie is otherwise safe.December 17 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) a couple who has lost a... (JoJo Whilden / Lionsgate )A tragedy devastating to experience can feel generic when transferred to the screen and that despite everyones best intentions and an outstanding performance by Nicole Kidman is what happens with ""Rabbit Hole."" Screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaires play about a married couple trying to cope with the accidental death of their 4-year-old son was nominated for five Tonys and won the Pulitzer Prize in 2007 and its likely that the intensity and intimacy of the theatrical experience was a factor in its success. As a film directed by John Cameron Mitchell however ""Rabbit Hole"" finds its focus diluted. Though effective in moments largely thanks to Kidmans elegant delicate performance the piece as a whole feels earnest and well-meaning but rarely compelling a film that is almost too decorous to be as involving as it should be. Husband and wife Howie and Becca live in a beautiful house in a friendly suburban neighborhood but ""Rabbit Hole"" immediately signals us through Anton Sankos spare score that all is not well in their neck of the woods. Kidmans Becca may look happy enough planting flowers in her backyard but she is deeply mourning her loss. Its typical of the films weakness for the obvious that a neighbor who comes over to invite her and Howie to dinner ends up stepping on one of those carefully made plantings. Ouch. Though in theory Howie and Becca are united in their grief over the death of their son eight months ago in practice they are on different wavelengths. Its not so much that their ideas are in conflict as that they differ in how extensively to implement them. Howie ( Aaron Eckhart) may still sneak glimpses at old cellphone videos of his son but in general he is ready to continue with life. He benefits from the support group he and Becca go to and is even considering though his wife definitely is not having another child. If Howies reactions are very straightforward Beccas are anything but and it is a tribute to Kidmans great skill that she captures all of this characters nuances and contradictions. On the one hand Becca is quicker to get rid of her sons clothes and take his childish artwork off the kitchen walls but that is just a mask for her intense pain. She may look like shes coping but under the surface she is still a wound-tight wreck. Tart-tongued and implacable Becca lashes out at everyone around her starting with Howie but not ending there. She snaps at her God-fearing mother Nat ( Dianne Wiest) when she tries to offer comfort and is annoyed at her party-animal sister Izzy ( Tammy Blanchard) especially when Izzy reveals that she has just gotten pregnant. When Becca is in a mood nothing anyone else says is anything but wrong. Though both husband and wife are in terrible shape from the same cause ""Rabbit Hole"" posits that what could have brought them together is pulling them apart. There is no room in either of their lives to take on the spouses pain and when Becca randomly catches sight of a high school student (Miles Teller) whose face she knows a whole other dynamic comes into play. While the films actors are all capable it is Kidman we want to watch most of all. When she is distraught and in pain we can feel it underlining how satisfying it is to see this actress take on a role that makes such good use of her great gift for naturalistic acting. ""Rabbit Holes"" themes are strong the questions of how we work through grief and go about reconnecting with life are unquestionably valid ones but an air of genteel familiarity stifles their impact here. A story of people perched precariously on an out-of-control ledge is not well served by a movie always on its best behavior. kenneth.turanlatimes.com Rabbit Hole MPAA rating PG-13 for mature thematic material some drug use and language Running time 1 hour 32 minutes Playing In limited release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESRabbit Hole other films place marriage in Oscar spotlightJanuary 6 2011Ace actors catch fire hilariouslyJuly 25 2008Down a `Rabbit Hole for reflections on griefSeptember 15 2006MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentAccidental DeathRabbit HoleCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-1217-rabbit-hole-20101217,0,7249138.story",200,rabbithole31,rabbithole,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In the opening scenes of Rabbit Hole Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart play characters who look the part of a content happily settled married couple. She tends the garden and politely turns down a dinner invitation so they can stay in alone together. He flirts with her as she prepares a risotto. Then when the phone rings at a too-late hour the looks on their faces tell another story. These are people whove learned how easily chance can make a life collapse. The call isnt serious bad news--Kidmans rough-edged sister (Tammy Blanchard) just needs to be bailed out after a bar fight--but theyve known bad news and recently. The fear in their eyes at the ringing of the phone suggests a hurt too fresh for it to be any other way. In fact its been only eight months since they lost their 4-year-old son when he ran out in the street in front of a passing car. The event has left them shattered and as they try to put themselves together theyve begun to discover that the pieces dont fit like they used to. He finds comfort in a group for grieving parents. She tries her best to bottle her grief inside but gets frustrated when her mother (Dianne Wiest) tries to be helpful. And when nobodys looking she quietly and for no discernible purpose follows the blameless teen driver (Miles Teller) who struck their child. Adapting an acclaimed play by David Lindsay-Abaire (who also scripted) John Cameron Mitchell directs Rabbit Hole with--apart from a few key moments--an almost TV-movie-like lack of adornment. Thats a smart choice. Any of the flourishes Mitchell brought to Hedwig And The Angry Inch and Shortbus would get in the way of the emotionally fraught material. The plainness serves it keeping the focus on the exceptional performances and the way grief keeps breaking through into everyday life at unexpected moments. Rabbit Hole is a tremendously sad movie but its also the furthest thing from a miserablist wallow portraying grief as something that doesnt arrive in neat stages but in unpredictable waves with forceful undercurrents. The film is also unpredictable in its own way setting up sensational plot developments that never arrive ones that would break the films concentration on people trying to understand why so much weight has landed on their shoulders and how or even whether they can learn to carry it.

In the films first scenes the couple acts out a domestic ""normal"" thats so obviously in quotes we know something must be terribly wrong. Mitchell the creator/director/star of Hedwig and the Angry Inch and the writer/director of the 2006 unknown-actors-having-real-sex-fest Shortbus teases us through a few fake-outs (phone ringing in the middle of the night? Psych--its just Beccas sister who needs a ride) before revealing that the films central trauma happened long before we got there Becca and Howies young son was killed in an accident and months later the couple is still trying to figure out how to go from ""normal"" to normal.Sensitive hunk Howie thinks they can get there by going to weekly group therapy sessions where similarly bereaved couples sit in a circle of sad. Becca a hyper-competent homemaker (an unexpected overnight guest isnt a burden--shes an excuse to whip up a creme brulee) who gives off the sense of having been tightly wound long before the transformational accident reluctantly tags along. Then after the kind of awkward incident that always happens in movie therapy and never in actual therapy Becca asks Howie if he wouldnt mind if she gave up on group.With the wife away Howie starts getting close to Gaby (Sandra Oh) whose spouse is also absentee. He catches Gaby smoking pot in the meetings parking lot and soon theyre flirting over Skee-Ball (yes Skee-Ball). Meanwhile Becca starts stalking Jason (Miles Teller) the 17-year-old high school senior who was driving the car that killed her son. Its not ever really clear what she wants from Jason but as the grieving mom and the teenager embark on a series of afternoon rendezvous (clandestine because theyre so obviously inappropriate on their face although the two meet in public and mostly talk awesomely about science fiction) it becomes evident that the mourning mothers motivation isnt as simple as revenge or retribution.Becca and Howies extracurricular relationships are the saving grace of a movie thats otherwise a sledgehammer of plot and score. These weird chaste-but-intimate courtships mostly undefined and regressive on both sides feel organically murky their narrative convenience overcome by the fact that they truly resemble the ""Howd that happen?"" bad-idea relationships that so often spring from trauma in real life. Not so true to life the montage that explains how both relationships resolve with major decision points coming for both Becca and Howie at virtually the exact same time on the exact same night.Mitchell made a name for himself telling stories that encourage the exploration of subversive desire; Rabbit Hole acknowledges such desires only to ultimately suggest theyre better left repressed. Which might be fine but here the proceedings are so lifeless that you find yourself rooting for the narrative to fully tread into the disaster zones with which it flirts. (Adulterous grief sex? Bring it Statutory rape of the teenager who killed your kid? Even better) Rabbit Holes tastefulness--one schematic acting showcase of a scene after another rendered in an incredibly manipulative prestige-pic ""minimalism""--just punishes Becca and Howie and the audience even further. As both halves of the couple display signs that no matter what transpires theyll give their miserable marriage one more good-faith try I wondered Havent they--and we--suffered enough?

Whole TV networks have been built on the bones of dead children and weve lost count of the number of books plays and movies that have assaulted our tear ducts--sometimes honorably more often not--with untimely mortality. Now in Rabbit Hole we meet another pair of bereaved parents the Corbetts Becca and Howie (Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart) a once-happy couple whose lives eight months after the accidental death of their 4-year-old son Danny have been shattered. But if the premise of Rabbit Hole is generic the honesty acuity and restraint of the execution--not to mention its dry gallows humor--are not. Adapted and smartly opened up by David Lindsay-Abaire from his Pulitzer- and Tony-winning play Rabbit Hole deftly sidesteps sentimentality and still wrenches your heart.Kidmans tightly wound Becca has coiled her sorrow into a knot of rage. Accompanying Howie to group therapy with other mourning parents she bristles with contempt at their testimony. Every attempt of her mother (Dianne Weist)--who lost a son herself--and her wilder newly pregnant sister (Tammy Blanchard) to comfort her is rebuffed as are her husbands advances. Howie doesnt cloak his emotions. He sits alone in their big Westchester house watching old home movies of his son wanting to remember; she tries to give away Dannys clothes and toys needing to forget. Unable to face each other they secretly seek solace elsewhere she with the high-school boy (Miles Teller) who was driving the car that killed her boy; he with a wry new friend from group therapy (Sandra Oh) who likes a toke on a joint before their meetings.The surprise of Rabbit Hole is that it is directed with self-effacing sensitivity by John Cameron Mitchell whose previous films Hedwig and the Angry Inch and the full-frontal Short Bus come from another planet entirely. An actor himself he wrings nearly faultless performances from his cast and hes smart enough to know that with a subject this charged you dont need to oversell the emotion. Rabbit Hole asks fundamental questions how do you go on living in the face of irreparable loss? How do you patch together a relationship that has been sundered by grief? The answers it gives tentative and hard-won may not be surprising but they feel right. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week gt;gt; NEXT The Fighter The One ...

Rabbit Hole By Richard CorlissThursday Dec. 09 2010 David Giesbrecht / Lions Gate Films A couple Becca (Nicole Kidman) and Howie (Aaron Eckhart) attempt to cope with the sudden death of their young child. Uh-huh there have been so many manipulative movies on this subject that simply to hear the plot of Rabbit Hole could induce a case of mourning sickness. But the tone achieved by writer David Lindsay-Abaire (adapting his Pulitzer Prize-winning play) and director John Cameron Mitchell (who did the splendidly rambunctious indie films Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Shortbus) is fine and generous an unbroken series of subtle privileged moments. Kidman in a career-best performance and Eckhart lend pitch-perfect calibration to the couples shared and separate agonies. Its as if previous treatments of the subject were a series of failed experiments and Rabbit Hole is the Eureka moment. This is how movies can bring a great grave theme to indelible dramatic life.

(He chased their dog out into the street and got hit by a car.) From 21 Grams to Reservation Road to Antichrist movies about couples who have lost children in tragic accidents offer a unique double challenge to an audience. The material itself is wrenching enough to be seen by many as off-putting. But even for those who are willing to follow a drama down this dark a path its easy to feel locked outside of the couples suffering since the whole point tends to be that the raw nerve of grief is too intense for them to touch. The bottomless sorrow the rage the catharsis We dont experience these things so much as we watch the couple work up to experiencing these things. Theres a lot of numbness mixed in with the devastation. Rabbit Hole based on David Lindsay-Abaires Pulitzer Prize-winning 2006 play (on Broadway it starred Cynthia Nixon and Mad Mens John Slattery) has dialogue that sears but the canniest thing about it is that it carves shrewd and lively dramatic arcs out of souls who are too damaged to feel their own feelings. Kidman plays Becca as a coldly wounded warrior who cant bring herself to jump back into the stream of her life. She wont act ""reasonable"" toward her husband and we can more than understand why To do so would be a betrayal of the emotional chaos that shes hidden away inside. Becca and Howie join a support group for grieving parents which allows the film to tweak the narcissism that can creep into even the most serious therapy circles. Yet Becca wont let her guard down. When Howie puts on some Al Green and nuzzles her on the couch she acts as if this gentle attempt at seduction were some sort of violation. Nothing intrudes upon her control over her own suffering. Kidman finds the courage to make Becca dislikable and the result is her most on-fire acting in years. In a neat reversal of how this situation often breaks down in terms of gender roles (at least in the movies) Becca tries to eradicate all traces of her sons existence (school paintings clothes the home-video memento she ""accidentally"" erases from Howies cell phone) whereas Howie wallows in the agony of it all. The whole life he loved has fallen apart but he wants it back and Eckhart shows a new kind of foreboding anger. Hes powerful as a man who will do anything to crack the ice. Rabbit Hole (in theaters Dec. 17) was directed in a somber change of pace by the playful maverick John Cameron Mitchell (Shortbus Hedwig and the Angry Inch) who shows a true flair for actors but opens up Lindsay-Abaires play in the standard functional you-can-still-see-the-stage-floorboards way. And Im afraid that at least one aspect of the play is second-rate Becca seeks out a connection with the pasty-faced comic-book-writing teenager (Miles Teller) who killed her son and their park-bench meet-ups are saintly communions of touchy-feely blahness. They make getting over the blame and the guilt look worse than difficult -- they make it sanctimonious.

Nothing Mitchell has previously done on screen -- the raucous musical ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" and the sweet though uneven sex-drenched ""Shortbus"" -- gave any indication that he could make a movie like this a quiet devastating beautifully acted drama about the devastation of loss and the slow muted barely-there return of hope. Lindsay-Abaire wrote the screenplay adaptation and did it so well that I would never have guessed this was once a play; theres none of the obvious ""opening-out"" that we see too often in plays-turned-movies. Kidman and Eckhart are beautifully believable as a couple who eight months after their four-year-olds death in a car accident are weary of grief but cant summon the energy for anything else -- Kidman in particular redeems herself after a string of disappointing movies in the last few years. Watch for Oscar buzz for her in this role as soon as this movie gets picked up for distribution. (Photo Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart in ""Rabbit Hole"" courtesy of TIFF.) And with that Im packing up my hotel room -- how did I get so many pieces of paper? why is there so much Diet Coke in here? -- and heading home today after a quick interview with Jim Broadbent. (Hes terrific in Mike Leighs ""Another Year."" Then again hes terrific in everything.) Its been a great festival and Ive attended more public screenings this year than I ever have giving me a chance to meet some nice locals who love the movies. Despite a few glitches (the French film ""Little White Lies"" had to have its gala premiere screening without subtitles -- somebody whose head is perhaps rolling down King Street right now apparently forgot to check that they worked with the auditoriums projector -- meaning that those who wished to experience the film in English had to be marched down the street to another theater after a long delay) all has gone smoothly. Its a remarkable feat when you consider that on a typical day TIFF offers 40 to 50 press/industry screenings alone; never mind the public screenings. A lot has changed at TIFF over the ten years Ive been coming we now get our passes electronically scanned (not so long ago press signed in on clipboards); the festivals moved mostly downtown where the facilities include TIFFs lovely new year-round home the Bell Lightbox; and there seem to be fewer press and more industry types. One change that disappoints me TIFF appears to have given up the fight on cellphone use during movies (perhaps because BlackBerry is a major sponsor?). There used to be an announcement to silence cellphones as I recall but now they dont even bother and screenings -- both press and public -- are speckled with little blue screens. A few resisters remain (during a quiet moment in ""Another Year"" yesterday a voice could be heard saying ""Please turn off your cellphone"") but for the most part its become accepted. And thats a shame not only because some of us still believe that a glowing cellphone is rudely distracting to other moviegoers but because it means that some who choose to attend TIFF that glorious carpetbag filled with movie magic are also choosing to not become fully immersed in it. I look back on the wonderful movies Ive seen over the past five days -- among them ""Black Swan"" ""Never Let Me Go"" ""The Kings Speech ""127 Hours"" ""In a Different World"" ""Love Crime"" ""Another Year"" and more -- and remember what it felt like to get lost in these movies forgetting another world exists. Its a joy. Anyway back to my usual world tomorrow. Thanks for reading; I hope a few of you had fun attending TIFF vicariously with me. Whats this?

TWITTER TORONTO -- John Cameron Mitchell takes a break from shepherding his sexually charged writing to the screen to direct David Lindsay-Abaires adaptation of his Pulitzer-winning play ""Rabbit Hole"" an intense intimate story of a couple reeling from the loss of their young son. This extreme change of pace allows Mitchell to burrow deeply into a more grounded kind of drama than is his forte. Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart deliver performances that are like raw wounds where nothing either one can say or do will blot out relentless memories and pain. ""Rabbit Hole"" will win its share of accolades but will it win audiences? The small screen better accommodates this kind of concentrated tragedy; in a cinema the story becomes like those support-group sessions the couple attends The film does achieve moments of catharsis but it can be heavy going. The story begins eight months after a traffic accident kills Becca (Kidman) and Howies (Eckhart) boy. The more the couple plays ""normal"" the more the effort fails. Becca tries to eradicate all signs of her son while Howie reaches out to family and friends. The group sessions barely help. Too much talk of God for Becca and though he wont admit it wallowing in grief isnt doing Howie any good either. The story pulls in other characters -- Beccas mother (Dianne Wiest) who also lost a son and a sister (Tammy Blanchard) whose pregnancy seems like a rebuke to Becca. Finally Becca reaches out and to the most surprising person. She happens to see and then makes contact with the high school student (Miles Teller) whose car struck her son. The two discover they share a common grief over the accident. The youth is developing a comic book that deals with parallel universes of other places where a sad person might be happy and a little boy might not lose his life. Meanwhile Howie has his own secret sharer a woman (Sandra Oh) from group who has become something of a long-term griever. You realize this couple is gradually coming apart by creating separate lives. Lindsay-Abaire knows his way around such grief what things feel like and how best intentions go very wrong. His writing carefully pinpoints the moment where bottled-up rage will explode or the smallest incident can trigger a complete loss of control. However ""Rabbit Hole"" traps its audience inside this prison of guilt and recrimination. The drama has its own relentlessness. Every scene is about the couples tragedy. Lines of dialogue inevitably have double meanings. Not even a dog gets walked without this being about the lost child. In this way the writing is too self-aware. The film cries out for moments that are not about the couples search for re-engagement. Cant a man simply walk a dog? Kidman grabs the central focus of the story as the more distraught of the two. The performance is riveting because she essentially plays the entire film at two levels the surface everyday life and then what is turning over and over again in her mind. Eckharts outgoing husband who isnt afraid to admit to his pain nicely balances the tightly wound wife. Hes open to whatever works -- but nothing does. So frustration compounds his anguish. Wiests mother is one that never loses patience with her daughter because she of all people understands. Teller gives a steady somber performance as a young man still in a state of shock whose whole life has gone off-kilter in a single moment. Mitchells crew does solid work in rendering an almost-too-perfect bedroom community outside New York. Then again this is all part of the films self-awareness No matter how safe and comfy your surroundings the film insists everything in an instant can disappear down a rabbit hole.

Grief may be the topic under examination but humor -- incisive observant and warm -- is the tool with which its dissected in ""Rabbit Hole"" a refreshingly positive-minded take on cinemas ultimate downer overcoming the death of a child. Adroitly expanded from the legit hit by playwright David Lindsay-Abaire (its original Pulitzer-winning author) and director John Cameron Mitchell ""Rabbit Hole"" fittingly offers a parallel-universe variation on what Broadway auds saw with Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart delivering expert understated performances as the pics central couple. A savvy distrib should have no trouble steering this quality drama through a healthy kudo season release. Eight months have passed since the accidental death of the Corbetts 4-year-old son Danny and the New York couple Howie (Eckhart) and Becca (Kidman) still feel their lives dominated by the loss. Even the pics opening gesture a metaphorical sign of regrowth that finds Becca laboring in her garden is set back when a well-meaning neighbor tramples one of her freshly planted seedlings -- no matter how hard she tries the healing is hard. Each has a different way of coping Howie holds on to all that reminds him of Danny while Becca wants to sell the house and move on. This is familiar territory movingly explored countless times before though ""Rabbit Hole"" is refreshingly light on the loss itself. With the exception of one unnecessary agonizing flashback late in the film everything takes place in the healing space of the present. But instead of moving on as they should Howie and Becca seem to be shutting down certain parts of themselves (they havent had sex since the accident for example and Dannys dog has been sent into exile with Beccas mother played by Dianne Wiest). Just as the birth of a child can strengthen certain unstable relationships a death threatens to permanently come between even the best-matched couple. With the larger canvas of the screen at his disposal Lindsay-Abaire deepens several key relationships. An offhand mention of the God-freaks in group therapy becomes a full-blown subplot as Becca rejects the collective sharing sessions where participants appear to be competing for some sort of saddest-story prize. (Empathy as whenever her mother evokes the death of a junkie uncle inevitably sets Becca on edge.) While Howie continues going to therapy alone bonding with ""professional wallower"" Gaby (Sandra Oh in an effective role created for the film) Becca reaches out to a teenage boy (Miles Teller) whose facial scars seem to explain what the character doesnt at first. While Lindsay-Abaire endeavors to open up the action director Mitchell uses the screen to make the material more intimate privileging auds with closeups vital to our understanding of the characters. At first ""Rabbit Hole"" may seem a radical departure from his more scandalous earlier work (gender-bending rock opera ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" and explicit sex drama ""Shortbus""); where those films felt transgressive ""Rabbit Hole"" is polite the production itself as neatly manicured as the Corbetts Pottery Barn-perfect lives. On closer inspection what all three projects share is the helmers insistence on raw unsimulated emotion. In Kidmans case its nice to see the actress lately immovable forehead participating in her performance with subtle almost imperceptible fluctuations in her carefully guarded facade allowing us to follow as Becca tumbles down the rabbit hole of her own emotions. Eckhart gets a couple of big shouting scenes but the actor manages to convey just as much in Howies quietly injured moments. A new scene in which Howie awkwardly attempts to show prospective homebuyers Dannys room perfectly balances melancholy and humor while seemingly mundane details -- struggling to use an iPhone checking on a cake in the backseat -- ground the characters in reality. ""Its a sad play. Dont make it any sadder than it needs to be"" Lindsay-Abaire advised potential theater directors in the authors note to his play. Mitchell whose own career began onstage respects the writers wishes and with the exception of the aforementioned flashback he shrewdly keeps the mood tipped toward the positive. Anton Sankos Arvo Part-esque score all introspective pianos and strings encourages us to feel without forcing a reaction while fleeting progression shots of a comicbook in progress enrich the payoff of the plays self-defining scene.
