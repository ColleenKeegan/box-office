This however is Working Title-land and tennis of course is one of those things that Americans like us to do - as well as driving open-top sports cars past the Houses of Parliament which star tennis player Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) does with surprising regularity in this tale of love across the tennis net.The game is simple. Two tennis players -Dunst and Bettany - meet over the hallowed lawns of SW19 one summer. Very soon its love all; but Dunsts father/manager (Sam Neill) is quick to pour water on their dalliance even though Bettany serves up lashings of British charm to woo both Dunst and audiences. In the meantime both have trophies to fight for cue tennis scenes that have at least some spark. Its hardly nail-biting but the sport works.Much has been made of the films making but its hardly notable verite. Yes this was actually really filmed at the gen-u-wine Wimbledon. Yes the crowds are kosher. Yes theres a cameo from John McEnroe. And no they didnt use real balls. They added them later. All in all its rather pleasant but nothing else. Dunst and especially Bettany make for good romantic leads (although Bettany flips between Hugh Grant and Michael Caine ). But where are the gags? And it could do without the thinly sketched sub-plots involving Peter Colts cheeky younger brother (James McAvoy) and warring Home Counties parents. A fairly charming romantic comedy - minus the comedy.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Wimbledon | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wimbledon ) Wimbledon (United States/United Kingdom/France 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Love in tennis doesnt have to be bad as Richard Loncraines Wimbledon shows. A formulaic motion picture that delights in spite of (or perhaps because of?) its reliance upon conventions Wimbledon is the kind of movie that allows the non-cynical movie-goer to sit back and relax in the presence of actors who work well with each other and a script whose familiarity is an asset. Its rare for any motion picture to successfully combine the clichA(c)s of the sports and romance genres while keeping a balance between them. In recent years I can name only two For Love of the Game and The Cutting Edge. To that select group Wimbledon can be added. The sports portion of the movie employs the usual underdog-makes-good scenario. Tennis is relatively new to this kind of treatment but we have seen it tried with everything from baseball to basketball to boxing to golf and theres not a lot of variation. The romance is more serious than comedic; Loncraine (whom art-house viewers may remember as the director of Ian McKellans Richard III) has a greater interest in developing a real-world kind of relationship than punctuating the love affair with goof-ups and pratfalls. There are laughs to be had but if you want to call Wimbledon a ""romantic comedy"" be assured that the emphasis is on romantic. Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) is a 31-year old tennis has-been. Actually make that a never-was. His current world ranking of 119 is considerably below his position at 11 in 1996 but even in his heyday he was never a household name. Now he has decided to announce his retirement after one more try at Wimbledon where he has garnered a wild-card bid. He first encounters up-and-coming American star Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) when he accidentally enters her hotel room to find her in the shower. This mistake turns out to be the beginning of a whirlwind romance. For Peter its the best thing that could have happened to him - hes winning matches he was expected to lose and advancing further into the tournament than anyone believed he could. The opposite is true for Lizzie who is favored to reach the finals. Shes losing her focus and her play is becoming sloppy. The film echoes some real-life tennis stories such as the 70s storybook romance between Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert (it was short-lived but made big headlines in the tennis world when it was hot) and the incredible ride to the U.S. Open semifinals for a 39-year old Connors in 1991 (before the tournament he was ranked 174). Anyone wanting to call Wimbledon a fairy tale is within their rights (and it does have a fairy tale quality) but the storyline doesnt venture too far from reality. As I have said dozens of times romantic movies are made or broken by how well the leads interact with each other. If an audience believes they are in love and wants them to be together its irrelevant how plain or convoluted the plot is. And in this case theres plenty of chemistry between Bettany and Dunst. Also while both are convincing when playing the romantic aspects of their roles they look good on the court as well. Although its possible that the editing has something to do with it Bettany and Dunst look like they know what to do with a racket. Bettany is a familiar face having been seen in films like A Beautiful Mind and Master and Commander The Far Side of the World. His manner is a lot like that of Colin Firth reserved and humble. Its part of his charm. Dunst on the other hand is known world-wide as Spider-Mans Mary Jane. Its to her credit that she sheds the superheros girlfriend image immediately. She becomes Lizzie and her natural high level of energy shines through. Shes as bouncy and lively as anyone this side of Reese Witherspoon. As much as Wimbledon gains from its two leads the film also offers other small pleasures. The supporting cast is stacked with competent actors including Sam Neill and Bernard Hill (best-known as King Theoden in The Lord of the Rings) as the fathers of Lizzie and Peter respectively. The script is smart and includes some incisive internal monologues by Peter. The handling of agents (one is played by Jon Favreau) is spot-on. And at least to a casual fan of the sport the script seems to have been penned by someone who knows what theyre talking about. Die-hards may be able to find gaffes but the screenplay stands up to a casual inspection. I have never apologized for my taste in movies and Im not going to start now. Yes Wimbledon is a crowd-pleaser but it doesnt energize audiences by pandering to the least common denominator. The film has heart and spirit and it does a lot of things well. There are plenty of other choices out there if youre looking for something surprising. Wimbledon has the feel of a comfortable bathrobe - you can sink into it and relax.

This is surely the first -- and most likely the last -- time youll see the names Bernie Mac and Paul Bettany in the same review let alone the same sentence. Is this it? Have forces finally converged to create the ultimate cosmic collision of high and low sacred and profane the big-brash-and-funny and the pale-blond-and-weedy? Are the end times upon us? No its just a between-seasons Friday as propitious a time as any to release ""Mr. 3000"" and ""Wimbledon"" a couple of bland unobjectionable comedies starring two of Hollywoods most reliable supporting players. And its merely a coincidence that these two actors happen to be portraying has-been athletes each of whom makes an unlikely comeback and in the process Gets the Girl and Learns Whats Really Important in Life. Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) and a ball boy (Jonathan Timmins) wish each other luck in ""Wimbledon."" (Oliver Upton -- Universal Studios) _____More in Movies_____  Mr. 3000 Details  Current Movie Openings  Fall Film Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies _____More in Movies_____  Wimbledon Details  Watch the Trailer  Current Movie Openings  Fall Film Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Todays Headlines amp; ColumnistsSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Breaking News AlertsSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now The tip-off that happy endings are in store isnt necessarily a spoiler when its made clear within minutes that both ""Mr. 3000"" and ""Wimbledon"" will hew faithfully to the rules of light undemanding comic diversion. Even when Bernie Mac affects a nasty snarling scowl as the title character of ""Mr. 3000"" the audience can sense that itll be only a matter of time before he melts into a puddle of life-affirming goo. As Stan Ross Mac plays a member of the Milwaukee Brewers who seems to have graduated from the Barry Bonds School of Comportment and Fan Relations. Once Ross gets his 3000th base hit and is assured a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame he quits mid-pennant race (after running into the stands to snatch the souvenir ball out of a stunned youngsters hands). Ross is arrogant a shameless showboat and a misanthrope -- in other words there arent many reasons to care when its discovered that Ross actually has only 2997 hits to his name and hes forced to re-up with the Brewers a full nine years after his retirement in order to get into Cooperstown. The ensuing scenes unfold with uninspired predictability the montage of Rosss Cinderella-on-steroids physical reconditioning the hazing at the hands of his younger faster stronger teammates the appearance of a love interest (a tough ESPN reporter played by Angela Bassett) and of course the climactic scene in which he must choose between his ambition and the well-being of his team. In the course of ""Mr. 3000"" Mac manages to find some moments of comedy within a movie that often feels like its going into extra innings. Although the writing and direction are flabby the drama contrived and the romance utterly unbelievable Mac -- who has become a star as a stand-up comedian and on his self-titled sitcom -- evinces his signature brand of grumbling physically subtle humor. ""Mr. 3000"" may not catapult Macs career out of the park but he has proved he can hold the big screen for longer than the few minutes he has heretofore been relegated to in movies. Faring considerably better is Paul Bettany in ""Wimbledon"" a high lob of romantic fluff from the producers who confected ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill."" Bettany plays Peter Colt a 32-year-old British tennis player whose early promise peaked when he was ranked 11th for several months; now hes at 119 and is on the verge of retirement to coach randy ladies at a tony country club. When Colt receives a wild card to play at Wimbledon he decides that the tournament will be his last hurrah. But when he embarks on an affair with a brash aggressive American player named Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) suddenly his game improves and he actually has a shot at winning the thing. ""Wimbledon"" is directed by Richard Loncraine (""Richard III"" ""Brimstone amp; Treacle"") who uses all sorts of fizzy edits and whizzing digital effects to approximate what it must be like in center court at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. The visuals get a little vertiginous at times but on the whole ""Wimbledon"" gets the tennis right (Dunst and Bettany trained for four months with former champion Pat Cash and their moves are surprisingly authentic down to every serve-grunt). Most everything else comes straight out of Ye Olde Shoppe of British Whimsy from Colts dotty parents in his posh ancestral manse to the promiscuous use of such vernacular terms as ""wanker"" ""snog"" and ""bollocks"" guaranteed to elicit charmed giggles from those Americans who still get a charge of those fancy-talking Limeys. Such force-fed quaintness is harmless enough -- a recent audience lapped it up like great dollops of clotted cream. But ""Wimbledon"" puts a foot wrong when it comes to Lizzie whom Dunst plays with her placid understated style. Its impossible to believe her as the ruthless player and voracious man-eater Lizzie is supposed to be; part of the attraction in ""Wimbledon"" should be the push-pull between the unapologetically ambitious American and the congenitally restrained English gentleman. Instead Dunst and her character as well as any erotic tension recede quickly to the background while Colt makes his unlikely way up the tournament ranks. Colts ultimate battle turns out to be not with Lizzie but with his conscience when he is forced to compete against his best friend or when a supportive ballboy is struck on the head by an errant serve. The best thing about all of this is Bettany until now best known as Russell Crowes confederate in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Master and Commander"" who has fully come into his own as a leading man viewers can happily root for and by the way as a bona fide heartthrob. With his unshowy demeanor and pleasant if unprepossessing features Bettany doesnt exude anything in particular that would qualify as star quality. Its simply there in his physical assurance his quiet focus and his ability to sneak up on a scene and steal it even with Dunst dimpling as often and energetically as she can. Bettany has reportedly said that he considers himself the actor the studios hire when they dont want to pay Jude Laws salary. That may be true but he could also be called this generations Trevor Howard who had a similar talent for conveying simmering depths beneath a carefully maintained veneer of cultured decency. If Hollywood types ever remake ""Brief Encounter"" theyve got their man. Mr. 3000 (104 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content and profanity. Wimbledon (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for profanity sexuality and partial nudity.

(Universal Studios/ ... more Photo LAURIE SPARHAM Not so hot on the court and an imperfect pairing off it 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Wimbledon Romantic comedy. Starring Paul Bettany Kirsten Dunst Sam Neill Jon Favreau. Directed by Richard Loncraine. Written by Adam Brooks Jennifer Flackett Mark Levin. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Watching ""Wimbledon"" is like witnessing a pair of tenacious hacks go at it on a municipal tennis court. The lunges and slides entertain until you realize balls are being played out of bounds and on the second bounce. ""Wimbledon"" glosses over some of its flaws with appealing leads (Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst) spurts of humor and fancy editing and camera work. But theres no hiding a hokey love story that undercuts the pictures compelling tennis scenes. Bettany plays Peter Colt a journeyman player ranked No. 119 in the world. Hes a self-effacing Brit in the Hugh Grant mode raised by eccentric parents on an ivy-choked country estate. Hes just about to become a club pro and eye candy for the clubs leathery matrons when he gets one more crack at Wimbledon as a wild card. Dunsts character Lizzie is more wildcat. An American and the tournaments female favorite she is fiery on and off the court shouting at umpires and propositioning Peter soon into their acquaintance. With her bedroom eyes and spaghetti posture Dunst is far more convincing as a seductress than as a top-ranked tennis player. Director Richard Loncraine fudges Dunsts tennis scenes by using close shots and emphasizing her grunts and determined expression. Bettany and Dunst dont lack chemistry entirely but they lack a chemistry thats built to last. The Peter character seems far too mature and road-tested to want anything more than a dalliance with Lizzie. It never computes when he turns moony and attributes his winning streak to the American minx. The romance encounters further contrivances because Lizzie though shes at least 21 must hide the affair from her father/Svengali. Sam Neill plays the father with a scowl that seems to come from another movie possibly one about a war tribunal. But the ""Romeo and Juliet"" stuff does provide a laugh or two. Peter attempting to sneak into Lizzies window is stopped by a fluffy barking dog. ""Its not what you think"" he reasons with the canine. A conflict between the lovers plays as falsely as their quick intimacy and leads to dumb scenes that test Bettanys innate dignity. Somebody actually allowed the line ""Love means nothing in tennis"" to make the final cut. I demand a replay. Bettany exploiting his slight resemblance to Boris Becker shines in his tennis scenes. He looks athletic but also somewhat worn out just as his character is supposed to be. Loncraine uses dazzling hyper-kinetic photography to follow the balls trajectory. At other times he favors slow- motion shots of sweat-flinging faces framed by blue sky (England has never looked sunnier). But the best court scenes are the simplest when the wear and tear of five sets shows on Bettanys face and in his forehand. A clever conceit allows us to hear Peters thoughts while hes playing. At one juncture he speculates about what the next point might lead to success and the purchase of a house which Lizzie could decorate -- ""though God knows what her taste is."" All these thoughts occur as he bounces the ball preparing to serve. Loncraine shot the picture at the 2003 Wimbledon tournament and his film captures the buzz of a major sporting event. In a slightly heightened but plausible scene the arrival of an American hotshot in the press room eclipses Peters announcement of his impending retirement. Loncraine also resisted the temptation to put real sports stars in the picture. The tennis players are portrayed by actors avoiding a phenomenon best exemplified by Brett Favres appearance in ""Theres Something About Mary."" John McEnroe and Chris Evert appear but as TV announcers and their running commentary never intrudes on the action. The supporting cast is uniformly solid. Jon Favreau is iron-clad funny as the ultimate ugly American a sports agent. James McAvoy from ""Bright Young Things"" makes a great sleaze as Peters porn-obsessed brother who bets against his sibling while exploiting his notoriety to get women. Young Jonathan Timmins endears himself as Peters favorite ball boy a good-luck charm who can also take a hit. -- Advisory This film contains raw language sexual situations.

""Wimbledon"" says that love will make you a better tennis player. As messages go Ive certainly heard worse. As movies go ""Wimbledon"" is a generally painless float down a lazy river. Lazy in the sense that theres nothing particularly fresh about this underdog-sports-drama-cum-romantic-comedy set during one of professional tenniss most prestigious tournaments. Painless in the sense that its stars (Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst) are cute and that the dialogue (courtesy of Adam Brooks) is pleasantly snappy. Whats more theres a third stealth component -- in addition to the fairly cliched love story and the equally cliched come-from-behind trajectory of the sports plot -- that makes the movie almost (repeat almost) interesting. Game set match Tennis pros Lizzie and Peter (Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany) find love off the court in ""Wimbledon.""

As Peter Colt an aging (by pro tennis standards) player once ranked as high as 11th in the world but now 119th and slipping Bettany has a real ability to make us not just see but to feel his characters interior life. With frequent self-doubting voice-over narrations and with a slightly twitchy quintessentially British air of corrosive insecurity the actor conveys perfectly the almost-sports-hero-on-the-skids. Loncraine underscores the impact of this performance by putting us on the tennis court with his swooping zooming camera where the 140 mph action -- and the sweat -- are palpable. Of course Colt doesnt remain a has-been in this his last wild card appearance at the All England Lawn Tennis amp; Croquet Club. What kind of movie would that be? Not this one at any rate. Instrumental in his eleventh-hour transformation from loser to champion is Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst) a young American tennis star at the top of her game who becomes in short order Colts lover muse life coach and tennis adviser. Needless to say there are obstacles to happily-ever-afterdom. Chief among them are Lizzies overprotective father and coach (Sam Neill); a romantic as well as athletic rival for Colt (Austin Nichols); and Lizzies own competitive nature. In the end all of it (and by ""it"" I mean life love poetic justice and happy endings) comes down to a single point. Doesnt it always? Its always one touchdown one run one basket on which the entire world hangs. ""Wimbledon"" is no exception to this rule. But when the game is played at such a high level it almost makes the fact that you already know the final score irrelevant.

Wimbledon Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wimbledon-2004,200,wimbledon11,wimbledon,rogerebert
"Wimbledon loses at both tennis and romance - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Wimbledon loses at both tennis and romance By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 17 2004 Poor England has first had to suffer the indignity of having no local win in its tennis championship in 68 years with Tim Henman coming close to a final on a few recent occasions and now it has to survive a movie that beats the countrys cruel reality into a cheesy romantic pastry.""Wimbledon"" attempts to give the millions of Brits who camp out in front of their television sets and outside of Centre Court what theyve been waiting half a century for a winner. The movie however ought to be written off as a loss. Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) is ranked 119 in the world. His careers been on the skids since it peaked in 1996 when he was number 11. But suddenly at his 13th and possibly final Wimbledon he hits the lawns and starts climbing through the tournaments main draw slaying the current French Open champ and defeating his good German friend along the way.The reason for this resurgent play is not excessive training smart coaching or even a trip to the BALCO labs. Its sex with Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) the cute tantrum-tossing American upstart who rights his mojo. This is a grave premise for a sports movie and a terrible excuse for a romance. But ""Wimbledon"" is the sort of movie that concocts a room-key mix-up to allow its hero to walk in on its heroine as she showers. From this introductory scene the picture never looks back coasting from one inspirational rendezvous to the next.This is Lizzies first Wimbledon. So her father and coach (Sam Neill) wants her head in the game. To hear dad tell it Lizzie is the little red Corvette of the womens tour. Lots of hookups are part of her routine and if her bed is empty her entire game could fall apart. Her quickies seem to suit Dad fine. What he cant abide is his daughters slowing down for love. This is our dramatic tension Will Lizzie continue to sleep with Peter to help them both triumph or fearing commitment and thus defeat will she break it off?""Wimbledon"" is refried ""Notting Hill"" with a Teen People glaze. The latter movie also gave us an American star cheering up some tired British guy. ""Wimbledon"" is blander and far less worth rooting for. The director is Richard Loncraine who tends to specialize in biggish importantish affairs like HBOs ""The Gathering Storm"" and his ingenious WWII adaptation of ""Richard III"" from 1995. He brings a lot of experience to the table but with the help of the movies writers not a lot of realism. On the eve of his semifinals match Peter doesnt sit around his hotel room sick with worry flipping through the channels or going over his game plan to win what is surely the match of his life. He climbs up the side of Lizzies secret hideaway and through her bedroom window. This is how anyone would behave the night before a huge test of endurance precision and skill like John Cusack in ""Say Anything.""But then the movie doesnt care a whit about tennis. And the actual tennis playing looks recreational at best. There is slapping slipping sliding and the needless hard-to-explain diving of the sort that you might recognize from college intramurals or phys ed. Bettanys tactic is to stick out his racquet and lunge at the ball as though the object of the game is to catch it and cook it up for dinner. Dunst as you might expect gives the playing her typical all. Her game face usually red and tight is often betrayed by her gangly stances.But for one to drone on about lousy lumpy tennis is to miss the point of ""Wimbledon"" which is about lousy lumpy love. The movie sees Peters success as an excuse to bring his folks together which in a better less self-centered movie would be fine. A Brit in the Wimbledon final might produce a country of tennis hooligans. We get family treacle instead. How else will Peters bickering parents know they love each other unless they watch him win from the family box? This power of love is native to no particular sport. You could make the same romantic comedy about rodeos -- and probably have less manure. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Pics genial Brit-wit sensibility and cross-gender appeal could serve up strong numbers. ""Wimbledon"" is a fanciful tennis-themed romance that compounds the old dilemma of ""Will he get the girl?"" with ""Will he get the trophy?"" But the answers are too predictable and laughs too scattered for this middling Universal release to generate much in the way of humor or suspense although central pairing of Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst has some novelty. Virtually unchallenged in an unusually dry season for romantic comedies pics genial Brit-wit sensibility and cross-gender appeal could however serve up strong numbers domestically and abroad. Timed to hit theaters at the end of the U.S. Open ""Wimbledon"" with its scenes of intense competition and faulty refereeing cant help but call to mind the controversial recent match between real-life pros Jennifer Capriati and Serena Williams. Incidental parallels may prove more amusing and resonant than anything in pic itself however which bounces back and forth between court and courtship with no more than serviceable results. Peter Colt (Bettany) is a 31-year-old English tennis player who as he discloses in weary voiceover was once ranked 11th worldwide but has since slipped to 119th. Well past his prime and on the verge of retirement Peter prepares for his final Wimbledon tournament when in one of the hastier meet-cutes in recent movie memory he stumbles into the hotel room of Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst) a girl who apparently thinks nothing of showering with the door open. Lizzie a hotshot American player with an aggressive courtside manner is determined to win big at her first Wimbledon. She makes no secret of her instant attraction to Peter who as a result finds both his lovelife and his game newly invigorated. Handily defeating one opponent after another Peter is suddenly a long-shot contender for the title -- until Lizzies domineering coach and father Dennis (Sam Neill) tries to put an end to what he sees as a dangerous obstacle to his daughters career. Although sports angle gives ""Wimbledon"" some muscle and dialogue with its overlay of European sophistication offers sharp banter pic remains a conventional and ultimately meager love story. At one point Lizzie accuses Peter of using sex merely to improve his game and despite sporadic bursts of chemistry between Bettany and Dunst pic never really convinces to the contrary. Best known for his work as a dramatic foil in ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" Bettany decisively squashes any lingering doubts about his viability as a romantic-comedy lead with a witty self-deprecating but wholly self-assured performance. A former tennis novice Bettany endured four months of training (with 1987 Wimbledon champ Pat Cash) before shooting. Dunst though as fresh-faced here as she was in the ""Spider-Man"" movies has a tougher time getting a handle on her character. Because pic cant decide whether to make Lizzie a victim or a sore loser Dunst is forced to play coy self-possessed furious and intimidated sometimes all at once. Aside from frequently throwing her racket on the ground in frustration however she isnt called on to display her technique on the court. Screenplay (by Adam Brooks Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin) is at once underdeveloped and overpopulated with too many ancillary characters Peters archrival American star Jake Hammond (Austin Nichols) is set up as a too-easy villain and perfunctory rival for Lizzies affections. As smugly played by Nichols Jake comes off as a trash-talking pretty boy who couldnt be more loathsome. Offering a welcome touch of humanity are Peters father (Bernard Hill) mother (Eleanor Bron) and rascally brother Carl (James McAvoy). Nikolaj Coster-Waldau also has fine subtle moments as Peters friend training partner and onetime opponent. Helmer Richard Loncraine (""Richard III"" telepic ""My House in Umbria"") brings stylistic flourishes to the tennis scenes deploying rapid zooms slow-mo and ball point-of-view shots to enjoyably visceral effect. Early matches feature a bit too much lazy crosscutting although the later tenser sequences are shot in more satisfying long takes. Game play is impressive across the board albeit with more rough-and-tumble diving and sliding than at an actual tennis match. Setting is thoroughly persuasive thanks to carefully timed shoots at the 2003 Wimbledon Championships as well as gorgeous on-location lensing in the streets of London.
