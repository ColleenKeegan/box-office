The new competition for Pokemon trainer Ash Ketchum includes ice crystals and a flying double-helix composed of figures resembling an alien alphabet -- and ""Pokemon 3 the Movie Spell of the Unown"" is just as cool and remote. The series quest for different and challenging Pokemon reaches a nearly absurd endpoint this time with a creature inexplicably called the Unown which is purely abstract and has none of the animal nature of previous pocket monsters. Plot is equally chilly though punctuated by Pokemon faceoffs that little fans demand. A fresh supply of younger Pokemaniacs will line up but its doubtful that the franchise can be sustained much longer as its original fans have left for fresher anime thrills. As in the previous longform spinoffs of the TV series the makers stress big action sequences over the whimsy and humor of the small-screen cousin but the action here tends to be clunky and repetitive. More problematic is the feeble human story that tries to say something about the will of one childs imagination but comes off as a misguided hostage drama. The quickly introduced Professor Hale a vet Pokemon researcher reads tales about ""mythical"" Pokemon while play-acting them out for his young daughter Molly. Soon back at work at a remote desert tomb Hale accidentally frees the Unown while trapping himself inside its alphabetical black hole. The string of stylized letters -- surely one of the oddest and least affecting bad guys in the history of animated childrens pics -- makes its way to Hales mansion home encasing it and the surrounding town of Greenfield in ice crystals. Molly whose mother previously vanished conjures up with her tiny mind the giant hairy fictional Pokemon Entei and begins calling it Papa. Converging on crystallized Greenfield Ash his Pokemon trainer gang and vagabond trainer Lisa are brought up to speed by Professor Oak whos conveniently accompanied by Ashs mom Delia -- just the woman to be abducted by the Unown as a substitute parent for the dazed and dazzled Molly. This sets Ash into action all of it covered by the local TV news. The battle is beyond Ashs ability though because he soon realizes that Molly can imagine herself as a Pokemon trainer superstar who can easily defeat Ash or Lisa. The contests within the larger contest are at least a respite from the wearisome sections showing Molly in a clueless daze creating a stasis that begins to grip the movie as a whole. A sign that the Japanese filmmaking team ran into a dead end is the sudden arbitrary entry of Charizard a long-absent Pokemon beast that decides to ally with Ash against Entei. Its not exactly Rodan vs. Mothra but for a few minutes the airborne war between these Pokemon lifts pic out of deep freeze. In an extremely strange and ill-thought-out turn of storytelling the emotions of a happy ending where Molly is reunited with her father and mother are completely drained by showing it in a series of distant long shots over the crowded closing credits. The animation doesnt display the kind of artistic advances that would compensate for the underdeveloped story. Though the ice-crystal fields are drawn with more than a nod to the nature scapes of Hokusai and include the bizarre touch of a giant cactus flower as a centerpiece theyre poorly rendered and lack any atmospheric dread. New pocket monster Entei is a fine addition to the collection but the Unown is just a bad idea that gets worse with time. As usual for the series English-lingo versions the sync between mouth movements and voice is uneven. Opening 17-minute short ""Pikachu the Movie 2001 Pikachu and Pichu"" is more fun than the feature though the drawing and action set in the big city lacks the trippy candy-colored stylization of previous Pikachu shorts.

(2001 Pikachu Projects) Forget ""Pokemon 3 The Movie."" I first want to talk about ""Pokemon 3 The Line"" which at a recent Saturday morning screening stretched across the lobby and out the door into a cold steady rain. Clearly after three animated feature films a TV series and uncountable collectible product tie-ins the popularity of the video game-inspired phenomenon is showing no signs whatever of abating. The scariest thing about this latest installment? Its not the fact that its subtitled ""Spell of the Unown"" in an apparent effort to get children to misspell perfectly good words like ""unknown."" Nor is it the on-screen cartoon mayhem as hero Ash Ketchum and pals continue to do battle - all in good fun of course - with other Pokemon trainers. Nor is it the troubling prospect of a 5-year-old girl named Molly about to be orphaned by . . . well by what exactly? By a mass of swirling hieroglyphs described by one character as ""alphabet soup without the soup."" In a nutshell these enigmatic flying runes (the ""Unown"" of the title) have swallowed up renowned Pokemon scientist Spencer Hale single father to young Molly. In his place they send Entei a so-called ""legendary"" Pokemon of leonine appearance who plays daddy to the now parentless girl while her home gets buried under a mysterious crystalline growth that only Ash amp; Co. can save her from. Creepy yes and confusing as heck but not half so fearsome as the three little words (""Until next time"") spoken by whom I dont recall. Maybe it was one of the several Pokemon characters - whose names to my adult ears sounded like NyQuil and Zoloft - making as the ads breathlessly tout ""their first ever animated appearance."" ""Pokemon 3 The Movie"" (G 93 minutes) - Contains interminable (albeit bloodless) Pokemon battle and a seemingly parentless tyke.

Directed by Marzieh Meshkini . (Not rated. 74 minutes. In Farsi with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) In ""The Day I Became a Woman"" the newest entry in the Shooting Gallery film series Iranian director Marzieh Meshkini tells three interlinking tales -- each one a feminist fable about the struggle for independence. Its a marvelous debut for Meshkini the wife of filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf (""The Silence""). Each of her stories has the timeless quality of a fable and each has wisdom and a quiet stoic sense of defiance in the face of patriarchal tradition. The first ""Havva"" finds a 9-year-old girl with one hour left before she becomes a woman and has to sever ties with her best friend a young boy. The girl played with perfect simplicity by Fatemeh Cheragh Akhtar doesnt understand these customs. As her last minutes of childhood count down she manages a vague wistful comprehension of the changes she faces. In ""Ahoo"" the second episode a young housewife disobeys her husband by riding in an all-women bike marathon. On horseback the husband catches up with and berates her telling her to dismount. Defiant she keeps riding until a number of men overpower her. Finally in ""Houra"" an old crone goes on a shopping spree buying an array of household items that she was always denied. Theres a thematic thread among these stories and a unifying quality -- call it chutzpah -- shared by the three female protagonists. Meshkini draws them with affection and frames their stories with graceful compositions and slow easy pacing. In the end its easy to imagine them as manifestations of the same person. -- Edward Guthmann SECRETS OF SILICON VALLEY Documentary. Directed by Alan Snitow and Deborah Kaufman. (Not rated. 60 minutes. Today through Wednesday at the Fine Arts in Berkeley April 18 at the Rafael Film Center in San Rafael April 24-26 at the Towne in San Jose.) Judging by its title ""Secrets of Silicon Valley"" might be a press release from a high-tech public-relations firm. More chest beating about technological advances? About the high-tech economic miracle and the ways in which its changing our lives? Think again. In fact ""Secrets"" is a bracing expose of the ""digital divide"" that separates Silicon Valley billionaires from the underpaid workers who keep the industry afloat. While high-level techies earn fortunes -- and the media celebrates a brave new world thats redefined communications and modes of business -- an underclass of ""temp slaves"" struggles to live on 8 an hour. Directed by Berkeley filmmakers Alan Snitow and Deborah Kaufman ""Secrets"" reveals the downside of a boom industry -- one in which companies use outsourcing and subcontracting to cut costs and allow certain workers (mostly white) to get rich while the rank and file (mostly nonwhite) cant afford to live decently. ""Secrets"" doesnt have an angry tone and yet the evidence it provides and the stories told by its two principal characters Magda Escobar and Raj Jayadev are disturbing. Escobar a Latina runs a low-income computer- training center in East Palo Alto but finds that inflated rents are forcing out the people she needs to reach. Jayadev an assembly worker in a Hewlett-Packard break packaging plant loses his job when he blows the whistle on pay inequities and health and safety conditions. ""Theres nothing new about this new economy"" Jayadev says. ""The only difference is that the (poor working conditions) arent acknowledged. "" -- Wesley Morris POKEMON 3 Animation. Directed by Michael Haigney. (G. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . If the kids are sleepier this time around ""Pokemon 3"" is too. The film is more inert than the first two ""Pokemons."" The odd subtexts include the Tao of capitalism cuddly critters as objects of euphemistic cockfighting and spiritual apocalypse all tied into a G-rated family-friendly knot. ""3"" is set in a verdant land called Greenfield and focuses on a girl who loses her Pokemon-hunter father to an ominous swirling entity. She thinks hes been reincarnated as a legendary feline Pokemon called Entai and demands that he go out and fetch her long-dead mother. Instead he comes back with Delia Ketchum the doting mom of adolescent Pokemon trainer Ash. Neither the girl nor Mrs. K -- both in some kind of post-traumatic consumer delirium -- can tell the difference. Ash knows though. But under the entitys spell Greenfield has become an impenetrable kingdom -- or a pulsing glittering radicchio. Ash will need a curiously strong vinaigrette to get her out that or his Pokemon buddies. Either way the stakes are pretty low. The first two films -- respectively about cloning and eco-friendliness -- had a greater sense of chaos and how to tame it. And the sarcasm of bumbling Pokemon catchers Team Rocket is kept to a cruel minimum. The series maudlin energies take over instead. Even little trainers pet Pikachu appears to have seen it all before. At times it all calls to mind Oz Narnia and the interplanetary squabbling of ""Battlefield Earth."" And the incidental themes of materialism persist The aforementioned entity is called the ""Unown"" a subliminal call to Americas children to turn in their tie-in tchotchkes. Although anyone living on the kiddie cutting edge knew halfway through the previous ""Pokemon"" flick what the folks responsible for this one cant admit Pokemon is over. Wheres our Power Puff Girls movie? -- Edward Guthmann JUST VISITING Comedy. Starring Jean Reno Christian Clavier and Christina Applegate. Directed by Jean-Marie Gaubert. (PG-13. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The time-travel comedy ""Just Visiting"" is as the French say amusing enough. They should know. This is an English-language remake of a 1993 French film. As ""Les Visiteurs "" it was a smash hit in France but didnt catch on in the United States in a subtitled version called ""The Visitors."" This new one keeps the same stars Jean Reno and Christian Clavier as a 12th century nobleman and his lackey but switches the modern locale from France to Chicago and adds digital effects for the bad-trip witchcraft that strands them in todays world. The formidable Reno (""The Professional"" ""The Big Blue"") holds the film together with his unwinking gravitas as a knight trying to get a handle on modern life but proudly sticking to his old ways. He treats his servant Andre (Clavier) with contempt and in return Andre invariably thanks him for each insult and instance of abuse. A lot of the humor deals with hygiene and sanitation as the middle-age Middle Agers try to cope with modern toilets kitchen utensils and such. The premise might tend to get tiresome but director Jean-Marie Gaubert who also did the French version brings it in under 90 minutes and ties all the loose ends together in a slick wrap-up. Christina Applegate (""Married . . . With Children"") plays the sword- wielding knights modern descendant and when he screws up and overreacts she will explain ""Hes French."" Advisory Contains gross-out humor. -- Bob Graham . ALL ACCESS Concert documentary. Directed by Martyn Atkins. (Not rated. 62 minutes. At the Sony Metreon.) Sting says the late Miles Davis once told him he had the biggest head. Turns out Miles had seen the singer in a movie on the big screen. A cross-section of todays pop stars -- Macy Gray Sheryl Crow Kid Rock -- get even bigger heads in this IMAX giant-screen concert documentary. The performances range from freaky (George Clintons riotous P-Funk) to unusual (Al Green with Dave Matthews) to just plain weird (the Roots with B.B. King and Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio). The sound is wonderfully state of the art. During Stings rehearsal take of ""Desert Rose"" with guest Cheb Mami cowbells and other percussion instruments are distinctly audible from overhead and behind even as the voices come at you head on. That clarity cant rescue such middle-of-the-road performances as Crows ""If It Makes You Happy"" performed solo on an empty soundstage or the great Rev. Greens goofy version of ""Take Me to the River"" performed with the Matthews band at Chicagos Soldier Field. Santana sounds sharp as ever but Rob Thomas guest spot on the smash ""Smooth"" only demonstrates how little star quality the Matchbox Twenty singer actually has. On the plus side Clintons house-party medley Mobys contemplative end piece and surprisingly the typically insufferable Kid Rock who rips through his signature song ""Bawitdaba"" with his late sidekick Joe C. at his knee. ""Music is a clearer indication of whats in somebodys soul than language"" says Anastasio in one of several bits of backstage footage. No argument there. But ""All Access"" never gets near the soul of todays pop music. -- James Sullivan . GYPSY BOYS Romantic comedy. Written and directed by Brian Shepp. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Brian Shepps ""Gypsy Boys"" is an eternal repetitive albeit earnest search for signs of intelligent (or at least emotionally available) life in a gay universe. Politically speaking the film is mum. Elsewhere it wont shut up. The men here are as vexed with the games and etiquette as the women of ""Sex and the City."" Shepp brings the fed-up attitude but none of the wit. For some guys watching a dozen characters comb San Franciscos AsiaSF nightclub for love sex and laughs might hit so close to home the experience could be like breaking and entering. Otherwise ""Gypsy Boys"" is wrecked by self-congratulatory pith that purports to get at the heart of the promiscuity but only inspires head scratching about why these are the lives writer-director Shepp chose to dramatize. The interwoven stories make up a sadly ordinary brutally plotless soap. It opens with its three most hapless characters searching for 25 spots on the body from which to drink champagne and ends with a literal pony ride into the sunset. Shepps observations might be ones youve had a hundred times and wished someone would put on film -- again only with worse lighting and a deeper house soundtrack. These guys are queer as folk too. To the films credit though the romantic angst seems less packaged and only slightly less pretentious than those on that Showtime series. Shepp proffers nothing new in the gay discourse department. But all the froth is warmed over too. Knights in shining armor (or skin so sweaty it gleams) and the men of the characters dreams come go and literally fade into the movies ether. Things never get deeper than the duo handing out doorway disses at the entrance of AsiaSF like ""Muppets"" armchair critics Statler and Waldorf. The sincere dramatic conflicts only beget more cliches. And in accordance with everything else in ""Gypsy Boys"" they are from the heart -- and the loins. Advisory This film contains strong language and sexual situations. -- Wesley Morris . HIT AND RUNWAY Comedy. Starring Michael Parducci Peter Jacobsen. Co-written and directed by Christopher Livingston. (R. 105 minutes. At the Lumiere.) A premise in search of a better-executed movie Christopher Livingstons ""Hit and Runway"" appears to be looking for a slot in the CBS lineup. Painfully untalented writer Alex (Michael Parducci) teams up with Elliot (Peter Jacobsen) a playwright to write an action movie and for a little while comedy ensues. Alex is a macho Italian. Elliots a gay Jew with a painful resemblance to Woody Allen. Livingston flirts with screwball satire and homage but gets tangled in conventions exactly the kind Alex would learn in his screen-writing night class. At its least grating ""Runway"" plays as a cheesy ode to unlikely creative partnerships. In the process of growing unbearably sentimental it snowballs into a criminally derivative copy of ""Manhattan""-era Allen. On its surface the film plays like a less fraught redux of the hetero-homo relations in ""Kiss Me Guido."" But Jacobsen appears to have been instructed to do Allen in the same way Livingston and co-writer Jaffe Cohen have cribbed the Woodmans lines and scenarios. The real fits of inspiration come early as Alex bribes Elliot into collaboration by promising him a date with Joey (""Dawson Creeks"" gay-hottie- in-residence Kerr Smith) the waiter/actor working at Alexs brothers restaurant. Joey happens to be a Judeo-phile a trait that yields a kiss thats like watching Sal Mineos mouth collide with Karl Maldens. Unclean but endearing anyway. The movie on the other hand with its strained stabs at straight romance (girls with glasses are hotter without them and other non- observations) is mostly unclean. -- Wesley Morris Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 9 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 10 Woman at scene of minor crash killed when car hits her Find Showtimes Search Theaters amp; Showtimes -- County -- Alameda Contra Costa Lake Marin Napa San Francisco San Mateo Santa Clara Solano Sonoma Show Movies Now Playing | Recent Releases | Critics Favorites Rated G | PG | PG-13 | R Latest News Officials believe no survivors in Texas hot air balloon crash Little shake 2.7-magnitude earthquake rattles Bay Area Philippine president calls off truce after rebel attack Ann Coulter slammed for calling war heros dad angry Muslim 4 Sierra plane crash victims were from Tuolumne County Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F.
