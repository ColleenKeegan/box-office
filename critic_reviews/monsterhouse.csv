Monster House centres on a couple of pubescent boys - 12-year-old DJ and his chubby pal Chowder - and their fixation with the creepy goings-on at the house across the street. Why is cantankerous old Nebbercracker so aggressively protective of his land and what ever became of his rotund wife? With the aid of a quick-thinking girlfriend the youngsters set out to solve the creepy conundrum in typically innocent childhood fashion. Elements of Rear Window are evident in the scenario while the script is both cleverly structured and for a kids film surprisingly coherent. Its also very funny exciting often scary imaginatively characterised and graced with some decent voice-overs especially that of Steve Buscemis old man. In the pantheon of CGI films its one of the most adult-orientated animations yet. I dont need to tell you that the kids in the screening were enamoured from start to finish.

Night Shyamalans ""Lady In the Water"" was inspired we are told by a bedtime story the filmmaker told his kids. Im here to tell you that this cloying piece of claptrap sets a high-water mark for pomposity condescension false profundity and true turgidity -- no small accomplishment for the man whose last two features were the deadly duo ""Signs"" and ""The Village."" Mr. Shyamalans new film in which a saintly water nymph named Story surfaces in an apartment buildings swimming pool is being sold as another of his tales of the supernatural. His first success in the genre was the genuinely creepy ""The Sixth Sense"" with its signature line ""I see dead people."" But that was seven years ago. Now everyone is dead in ""Lady In the Water"" and they arent meant to be. Theyve simply been suffocated by super-seriousness in the telling of a small murky fable. ENLARGE Murky like the water in the pool or like Christopher Doyles cinematography. If I understand correctly Story is a character from an ancient bedtime tale -- in the movies terminology a Narf. She has ventured from her home the Blue World for the sake of humankind but she needs human help to return since her passage is blocked by Scrunts -- snarky growlers from the world of not-so-special effects suggesting hyenas with Formica-chip coats. Story who speaks without contractions is played by Bryce Dallas Howard with the sentimental diaphanous quality that was once associated with Laura in ""The Glass Menagerie."" She is always on the verge of tears or in tears thanks to her fears for humanity or for herself or to the chlorine in the pool. Paul Giamatti is Cleveland Heep the apartment superintendent who discovers her and who by protecting the fragile Narf finds his own higher purpose. The filmmakers purpose is to make Cleveland a surrogate for suffering humanity by giving him an off-putting stutter and a tragic past. ""Your words are very beautiful. Your heart is very big"" Story tells him after peeking in his private journal. But the words that Mr. Shyamalan puts in Clevelands mouth are very pretentious in their very mock-simplicity and ones heart goes out to the superb actor charged with speaking them. ""Lady In the Water"" is studded with cartoonish performances in other roles Mr. Shyamalans notions of comedy and horror have grown equally grotesque. And the narrative is littered with tedious complications -- rules to be followed in the course of the quasi-religious rite that will save Storys life and redeem those who save her. For bad measure the filmmaker has thrown in a dyspeptic movie critic played by Bob Balaban who doesnt have a clue about movies not to mention real life. ""Im seeing a romance film tonight"" he announces prissily ""but its not my cup of tea."" This guy would love Scrunts and Narfs. Monster House ENLARGE Three children try to unlock the secrets of the Monster House. ""Honey Im home"" says Mr. Nebbercracker the neighborhood ogre in ""Monster House."" Hes talking to his house which far from being a honey has a habit of ingesting anyone who comes too close. This PG-rated Halloween-in-July extravaganza a debut feature directed by Gil Kenan with Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg as executive producers is enjoyable enough for kids though its haunted-house effects are too intense for very young ones. ""Monster House"" was shot with the same motion-capture process that was used in Mr. Zemeckiss ""Polar Express"" a process I didnt like then and dont like now even though advancements have been made in its area of obvious weakness immobile faces. ""Monster House"" benefits from strong graphic design and lovely lighting but the script is nothing to write home about. It focuses on three neighborhood kids reminiscent of the trio in ""Harry Potter"" who dare to penetrate the house in an effort to tame it. By the time theyve survived a succession of standard-brand terrors done with visual flair they understand what every homeowner already knows -- a house can eat you alive. Heading South The title of ""Heading South"" may be a double entendre a reference to geography and human anatomy but Laurent Cantets fascinating troubling drama has many meanings. Its set in the late 1970s in Haiti a tourist paradise for three white middle-aged women from North America -- one is Canadian -- who are taking pleasure to varying degrees from young and handsome Legba (Menothy Cesar) a black male prostitute. At first the film puts us in the intentionally discomfiting position of voyeurs watching two of the women vie for Legbas affections -- Mr. Cantet is too tactful to dwell on the physical details -- and listening to them as they speak directly to the camera of their sexual yearnings. Charlotte Rampling is alternately touching and frightening as Ellen a professor of French at Wellesley. Brenda a troubled divorcee from Georgia is played by Karen Young whose mercurial performance made me think of Geraldine Page in Tennessee Williams dramas that in fact share a certain amount of territory with this one. Sex-obsessed though its women may be ""Heading South"" sees them and their obliging lover in the larger context of sexual politics and colonial relationships. ""Legba belongs to everyone"" Ellen tells Brenda. ""He makes the decisions."" Thats not true though. As a citizen of impoverished Haiti Legba is at the mercy of a brutal regime. As a gigolo at a beach resort hes at the mercy of the wealthy women he seduces and taunts. Legba belongs to everyone but himself. Overlord The American writer-director Stuart Cooper made ""Overlord"" in 1975 but only now has his remarkable film set in England during World War II been given an American release. (Operation Overlord was the Allied invasion of France.) Even before the action starts the film announces its singularity with the very first title ""The Imperial War Museum Presents."" The museums vast archives centered in London were the source of military and newsreel footage around which the dramatic content was written and shot. (And shot superbly in evocative black and white by the late John Alcott Stanley Kubricks favorite cinematographer whose specialty was making powerful images with the simplest possible lighting setups.) The story has its own simplicity and power. ""Overlord"" follows an English recruit Tom (Brian Stirner) from basic training to a Normandy beach on D-Day. Hardly more than a boy Tom finds time for a fleeting dalliance with a tender young woman but he goes into battle with an abiding sense of doom. ""This war has killed so many already"" he tells a mate. ""Im just going to be another one."" Using the Imperial Museums footage Stuart Cooper sets Toms fate against the gargantuan machinery of war. ""Overlord"" feels like a small but vivid tragedy inside an epic container. In Brief ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" stars Uma Thurman as Jenny Johnson a k a G-Girl a neurotically needy superhero. The movie was directed with all the finesse of a junior high school pageant by Ivan Reitman. (Yes the same Ivan Reitman who directed ""Ghost Busters."") Luke Wilson is steadfastly bland in the role of Matt Saunders a regular guy who cant deal with Jennys insecurities Theres a funny idea here but you might not know it from Don Paynes script or for that matter from Ms. Thurmans performance which serves as an unintended tribute to Quentin Tarantino who used her so effectively in the two volumes of ""Kill Bill."" ""Youre young"" a doctor tells the hero of ""Time To Leave"" a fashion photographer named Romain (Melvil Poupaud) who has just been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. ""Id prefer that you fight."" But Francois Ozons French-language tone poem for lack of a better term to describe the straight-line drama isnt about fighting. Its about a gay man coming to terms with his mortality and in a plot twist thats as contrived as it is ironic with the biblical injunction to procreate. As the heros beloved grandmother Jeanne Moreau has a few lively scenes in a somber film that needs them.    DVD TIP A year before his spectacular comic performance in ""Sideways"" Paul Giamatti was less spectacular but brilliantly comical in ""American Splendor"" (2003) as Harvey Pekar an American original who turned his ostensibly ordinary life into comic-book narratives of extraordinary depth and feeling. Hope Davis is Harveys wife Joyce. The film was written and directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini and photographed by Terry Stacey.

"Monster House | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; monster-house ) Monster House (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Monster House is to the best of my knowledge the first animated haunted house movie and quite possibly the first family film to recall at various times Halloween A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Amityville Horror. (Parents dont worry - the references are benign.) Its part story and part spectacle with the two halves being nicely balanced to offer something for just about everyone. The film pays enough attention to character development for us to care about the protagonists (although it uses stereotypes as a short-cut) and theres a substantial amount of humor. While Monster House is in no way groundbreaking its an enjoyable way to spend 90 minutes and is suitable for all but the youngest children for whom some of the scarier sequences may be too intense. The premise is simple enough although some wrinkles are introduced along the way. Basically the movie is about the efforts of three kids - DJ (voice of Mitchel Musso) Chowder (Sam Lerner) and Jenny (Spencer Locke) - to rid the neighborhood of a possessed house that sits across the street from DJs home. This house has a bad habit of ""eating"" anyone who ventures onto its property. The door opens a carpet tongue rolls out and the widows stare balefully at the offending party who is about to become dinner. To add urgency to the situation its Halloween and dozens of trick-or-treaters will be approaching the door in costumes expecting to be given treats not to become them. Theres enough action and mildly scary stuff to keep restless viewers involved but the thing I appreciated most was the way in which the three friends interact. Their dialogue rings true. The two boys both on the verge of puberty do silly things to impress Jenny. She recognizes whats happening and uses it to her advantage. Most movies regardless of whether theyre live-action or animated arent this perceptive. Its a credit to first-time director Gil Kenan and his screenwriters that they invest the time and effort to get this right. The filmmakers were smart in the way they cast the voices. The three lead characters are played by relative newcomers while ""familiar"" voices fill supporting roles. Steve Buscemi is Nebbercracker the cranky old man living in the deranged house. Catherine OHara and Fred Willard play DJs parents. Maggie Gyllenhaal is Elizabeth the baby-sitter and Jason Lee is her gnarly boyfriend. Jon Heder gets into the action as the best video game player on the face of the earth - a guy who will wear an adult diaper so he doesnt have to interrupt his time at the console with bathroom breaks. By using this approach the filmmakers can utilize recognizable talent while giving us fresh voices for the leads thereby not generating preconceptions. (Would we view Jenny the same if for example she was portrayed by Dakota Fanning?) Visually it cannot be argued that the film offers anything new to conventional theater viewers. What impressed me about Monster Houses animation is not so much how the characters look (theyre a little doll-like) but how naturally their motions are rendered. Consider a throw-away scene early in the film when DJ and Chowder are shooting hoops. The way they dribble and shoot the ball is so fluid and effortless that its difficult to accept its not live-action. 200 theaters will be showing Monster House in 3D and it promises to be a treat in that format. The conventional print offers a taste of what the fortunate minority will experience since there are a lot of scenes in which objects come at the camera. (Consider the opening scene with a girl on a tricycle stirring up a storm of leaves.) I enjoyed watching Monster House in a regular theater; I expect those seeing it in 3D will have an elevated opinion since it will be closer to a cross between a movie and a thrill ride. Fortunately Monster House is strong enough that it doesnt need the 3D; it offers enough to make it palatable in any local multiplex.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Monster House"" with the voices of Steve Buscemi Nick Cannon Maggie Gyllenhaal Kevin James Jason Lee Catherine OHara Jon Heder Kathleen Turner Fred Willard Mitchel Musso Sam Lerner Spencer Locke. Directed by Gil Kenan from a screenplay by Dan Harmon Rob Schrab and Pamela Pettler. 90 minutes. Rated PG for scary images and sequences thematic elements some crude humor and brief language. Several theaters. Aimed at kids too young for teen movies but too old (or so they think) for anything rated G ""Monster House"" is an enjoyable ride on a dark but not-quite-scary-enough-to-make-you-scream roller coaster told in elegant motion-capture animation. At its center are a trio of preteens anyone will recognize 12-year-old DJ (voiced by Mitchel Musso) a gangly kid who lopes around like he doesnt know quite what to do with his ever-sprouting arms and legs; Chowder (Sam Lerner) his chunky wisecracking best buddy; and Jenny (Spencer Locke) a smart poised girl whom DJ and Chowder are trying to impress but arent sure how. The three are brought together in battle against the house across the street which stands as a stark contrast to the other cookie-cutter Colonials in their anonymous suburban neighborhood. Its windows are dark its shingles are shedding its front yard is bare and forbidding and when annoyed it sticks out its red Persian-rug tongue and swallows whatever dares traverse its walkway. This is not normal suburban behavior for a house but as usual the kids cant get any grown-ups to do anything about it. So they hatch a plan on the day before Halloween involving a lot of cough medicine a vacuum cleaner and ... well kids Im not going to give it away but theres plenty of action in the third act. Though made with precision and genuine affection for its kid characters (who sit precisely on the cusp of being almost too old for Halloween but wanting to trick-or-treat anyway) ""Monster House"" isnt going to appeal to a very wide audience. Small or sensitive children will likely find it too scary though the animation acts as a distancing device. Some of what we see could be truly terrifying in live action but is darkly whimsical when animated. Adults looking for the humor and heart trademarked by Pixar movies may be disappointed; this isnt a family classic but a toned-down Saturday-matinee thrill ride. But the voice performers are all top-notch particularly Maggie Gyllenhaal as a slinky punky babysitter -- who finds the kids like totally annoying -- and Jason Lee as her spacey boyfriend. And the animation is often a kick. Spindly DJ with his toothpick limbs would fit into any Tim Burton fantasy and a few of the scenes involving golden-hued autumn leaves are surprisingly lovely. (You wonder why this films release wasnt timed with Halloween.) Director Gil Kenan keeps the pace zooming along nicely and ""Monster House"" ends before you have time to get tired of it -- like the best of carnival rides.

Unlike so many animated movies that offer lessons such as family is important and teamwork is good Monster isnt looking to teach you. Its looking to scare you. And it does. The movie may be rated PG but Monsters clever use of sound and shadows will likely have parents flinching in their seats with the kids. Twelve-year-old pals DJ and Chowder voiced by newcomers Mitchel Musso and Sam Lerner suspect that something is amiss at the creepy house of old man Nebbercracker (wonderfully brought to life by Steve Buscemi). When Nebbercracker is taken to the hospital with a heart attack the boys decide to find out whats going on in the house that not only seems to eat kites and footballs but also trespassers. Using the same stop-motion animation featured in The Polar Express Monster fills the void of films such as Cars and Finding Nemo. Pixars otherwise wonderful movies tend to shortchange one subject humans. And Monster gets its humans right from the way kids run and dance to the way they fear crotchety neighbors and creaky houses. Chowder dribbles and shoots like a boy whose body is outgrowing its reflexes. And teenager Skull (voiced by Jon Heder) turns a video game into a physical sport. And the movie nails the memories of childhood the battles with babysitters the anti-cipations of Halloween and the cranky neighbor who confiscates errant footballs. The movie treats children with respect. Monsters pre-teens are sarcastic think theyre smarter than their parents and are going crazy over the opposite sex. And Gil Kenan in his directorial debut doesnt coddle his young audience. He knows children like to be scared. This isnt a house filled with ghosts. The house is a ghost and not all who approach it survive. Which makes you wonder why this movie is coming out in the middle of summer. Monster has the makings of a must-see Halloween movie written all over its haunted walls.

DJ (Mitchel Musso) suspects the house across the street is alive in Monster House. Photo Columbia Pictures Monster House 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Now heres some fizzy summer fun Monster House a frankly horrific and full-tilt hilarious family yarn about a man-snacking mansion. Its engineered to scare your pants off split your sides and squeeze your tear ducts into submission. Animated with motion-capture technology that tracks the movements and expressions of live actors before computer-zapping them into cartoons the movie bears a superficial resemblance to the similarly-made Polar Express -- by one of Monster Houses executive producers Robert Zemeckis. Officially the new films director is film-school grad Gil Kenan making his feature debut. But you neednt look too closely to find the ubiquitous paw prints of another exec producer the ever-imitable Steven Spielberg. Theres no mistaking him The absent parents and intrepid boisterous kids (E.T.). The ugly-legged monstrosity in hot pursuit (War of the Worlds). The creature-goes-ape-on-a-car scene (Jurassic Park). The brassy heroics (Raiders of the Lost Ark). The sniffle-inducing end (take your pick). All of these blockbuster chunks are whipped into an entertaining froth -- along with spunky voice work and irreverent utterly believable characters that give the film an unexpected buzz of realism. The kids in Monster House look act and sound like flesh-and-blood pre-teens. So its the day before Halloween. Our hero D.J. (voiced by Mitchel Musso) happens to live across the street from the crotchety old Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) and his rickety old house. Whenever a child drops anything on the lawn -- a tricycle a ball -- Nebbercracker runs out seizes the item and rants maniacally about property rights. Then one fateful day D.J.s best chum Chowder (Sam Lerner) loses his basketball on the geezers voracious lawn Movie geeks will note that its a Wilson the same brand of sports equipment that befriended Tom Hanks in Zemeckis Cast Away. D.J. attempts to retrieve it. In the dust-up that follows Nebbercracker hoists him in the air and suffers a heart attack. ""Im a murderer"" D.J. moans. ""No youre not"" Chowder reassures him. ""When its an accident they call it manslaughter."" Fortunately D.J.s parents are away. Unfortunately the baby sitter (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a skinny goth witch. Fortunately D.J. and Chowder are spying on Nebbercrackers house when it spits out a carpet runner and attacks a pretty pigtailed girl (Spencer Locke) -- who thereafter joins the boys with the disclaimer ""Normally I dont spend time with guys like you but a house just tried to eat me."" Most of the dialogue (from screenwriters Dan Harmon Rob Schrab and Pamela Pettler) is equally snappy and Chowder is a gas. I could watch that kid all day; who cares if hes not real? Be warned that Monster House is as morbid and horrifying as it is funny -- too horrifying could be for the tiniest movie goers. My three kids were frightened but not traumatized and my youngest (almost 6) had to hide his face a few times. But everyone laughed and everyone slept well no nightmares. I think I know why. Remember for a moment the Spielberg factor. Recall his insuppressible penchant for happy endings. Monster House is full of menace but none of it comes to fruition; in the end just one sorry person winds up dead and gone. I wont say who but do yourself a favor and stay out of the basement. Even Spielberg cant save you there. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals PS4 Games at Amazon from 10 + free shipping w/ Prime City Jogger Baby Strollers from 156 + free shipping Open-Box Wolfgang Puck 22L Pressure Oven for 70 + free shipping American Airlines Nationwide Fares from 38 1-way Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Creepy. Thats what some critics thought of the animation technology used to bring ""The Polar Express"" to the big screen. I wasnt one of them. Chris Van Allsburgs sweet fable and the movies snow-globe atmospherics were so charming that I wasnt put off by the quasi-realism of the human characters or the vaguely menacing uniformity of Santas elves. ""Monster House"" directed by Gil Kenan and executive-produced by Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg provides a second feature-length gander at that hyper-stylized animation. The filmmakers hoped for a funny scary picture. And any of you who have ever entered one of those seasonal haunted houses knows exactly the sensation they were going for that delirious instant when you scream laugh and possibly wet your pants all at once. ""Monster House"" never pulls off this transit of kiddie fright to delight and back. Yet there is plenty here to dread. The movie is a creepfest. And I dont mean that kindly. As Halloween approaches in Mayville 12-year-old DJ (Mitchel Musso) is keeping a record of strange goings-on. The geezer in the bleak fixer-upper across the street is confiscating with increasing frequency the toys of kids unlucky enough to trespass on his lawn. A run-in with Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) convinces DJ and pal Chowder (Sam Lerner) of brewing supernatural trouble. And when whip-smart prep-school student Jenny (Spencer Locke) is nearly gulped down by Nebbercrackers house a team is born. If ""Why so real?"" was the chief cavil about ""The Polar Express"" ""Why so unpleasant?"" might be the complaint here. ""Monster House"" (which the MPAA in its infinite confusion rated PG instead of PG-13) features brief scenes of marital bickering longer instances of teenage nihilism and a depressing lesson on personal liberation. Sure theres something to be said for keeping it real but kids deserve better not bitter fables. A childs imagination amplifies and exaggerates without much prodding. So showing Nebbercracker yank a little girl from her trike or shake DJ is overstated. Kids also have a fine-tuned ability to pick up on hypocrisy although thats not the same as being made cynical by it. Maggie Gyllenhaal who achieved cult status early as a most compliant employee in ""Secretary"" plays DJs babysitter Zee. She arrives listening to Olivia Newton-John waits to impress DJs parents (Catherine OHara and Fred Willard) before shape-shifting into a bad-itude teen who couldnt be bothered to keep an eye on her ward. Who knew naughty-girl typecasting translated into animation? ""Monster House"" acts as a flashy primer in the meanspiritedness of contemporary horror flicks. It even features a milder version of the comeuppance that randy rule-breaking teens are dealt in movies like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween."" Written by Dan Harmon Rob Schrab and Pamela Pettler this isnt just another scary movie. Its a freakish example of what can happen when cutting-edge technology isnt hitched to equally gifted storycraft. Naturally there is a mystery at the heart of the movie Why is Nebbercracker so evil? Thats the way slacker Bonz (Jason Lee) puts it. Or if you view the old man with a bit more compassion why is he so darn crotchety? In a tender flashback that hints at Tim Burtons finer macabre fairytales we meet Nebbercrackers deceased wife Constance (Kathleen Turner). Could this suffering spouse be the spirit possessing the house? Its a promising twist that the movie quickly squanders to make way for an action-packed ending. That visual set piece comes when the house tears itself from its foundation to rampage down the streets of Mayville. Granted its a showy triumph for the hardworking and talented animators. But like an empty house its victory is hollow. Film critic Lisa Kennedy can be reached at 303-820-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

"Monster House is built just for kids - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Monster House is built just for kids By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  July 21 2006 ``Monster House"" the new computer-generated family film about a possessed mansion is like one of those gross-out childrens novelty books -- the ones with the googly eyes -- and it attracts a certain kind of kid. Personal anecdote I took the family to the screening and when the lights came up my wife was shaking her aching head in dismay the 11-year-old was opining that she found ``Howls Moving Castle "" a much more elegant treatment of similar material and the 9-year-old -- she sat there grinning in low-down rapture.Theres your demographic sweet spot ``Monster House"" is the first horror comedy made exclusively for fourth-graders.It takes place in one of those suspiciously underpopulated movie suburbs lighted with the hard clarity of digital animation. Earnest young DJ (the voice of Mitchel Musso ) is obsessed with the decaying manse across the street owned by cranky old Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi ) and alive in some witchy way. We know this If a stray ball lands on the lawn or a tricycle accidentally turns up the walkway the toy is sucked inside never to be seen again.Why dont the adults notice? Because movies like this demand grown-ups be clueless or nasty. DJs mom and dad (clueless) go away for the Halloween weekend leaving him with babysitter Zee (nasty and voiced as such by Maggie Gyllenhaal ) and her dim rocker boyfriend Bones (Jason Lee ). With porky best pal Chowder (Sam Lerner ) and Jenny (Spencer Locke ) a prep school girl passing through the neighborhood with a wagonful of Girl Scout cookies DJ attempts to discover the secret of the Monster House. Which of course means going inside it.``Monster House"" is from the people who gave us ``The Polar Express "" and it uses the same digital technology characters movements are ``traced"" from the actions of wired-up live actors. Where ``Polar"" tried to create photorealistic humans and wound up with soulless zombies though this one stays sensibly on the cartoon side of the ledger. DJ and his pals have appealingly oversize heads and pipe-stem bodies; its as though the Sims had turned out en masse for the audition. (The one remaining creepy touch No eyelashes.)The script too has some agreeable elementary-school wit before it settles down to massive destruction. DJ and Chowder are poised at the lip of adolescence and their attempts to woo Jenny are hapless in the extreme. Those comedy gains are offset by a grimness on the movies edges -- Chowders home life sounds downright dysfunctional -- and by a performance by Nick Cannon  playing a fraidy-cat local cop that borders on feets-do-yo-stuff embarrassment.The movie goes bananas when the kids finally get in the house and there are enough zooming camera shots and things flying at the audience that you know ``Monster House"" will be playing in 3-D somewhere (and so it is at Boston Common and various suburban theaters). The mansion has a personality as well as parts that correspond to a human body -- the chandelier over the staircase it turns out is a uvula . (``So its a girl house"" marvels Chowder . )Down the heroes go to the heart in the basement the house kicking and screaming all the way. I wont tell you whats down there other than to say it involves the voice of Kathleen Turner  and that may be the scariest thing of all.Even at 87 minutes ``Monster House"" overstays its welcome. The finale is an overbearingly loud chaos of splintered boards and sentiment Just the sort of funhouse ride to thrill a kid while Mom and Dad reach for the noise-canceling headphones. Is it too scary? Not really Like an E10+ video-game the films crude jolts dont stick.If youre wondering what business a Halloween movie has being released in the middle of July by the way rest assured the DVD will be inescapable come October. The home-video tail is no longer wagging the dog -- it is the dog. For its own part the movies a big rambunctious mutt Fine for a play date  but think twice before letting it into your own house.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

CR Sony ... more Photo Sony Pictures Imageworks Kids mobile faces give animated Monster its meaning 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Monster House Animation. Featuring the voices of Steve Buscemi and Maggie Gyllenhaal and introducing Mitchel Musso Sam Lerner and Spencer Locke. Directed by Gil Kenan. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Monster House"" feels like a safe bet from the first shot which shows an orange leaf blowing off a tree and gliding all the way to the ground. The shot is executed with the precision weve come to expect from big-budget animations but theres an unexpected beauty about it as well a delicacy that characterizes most of the picture -- even though the story is about a house that devours people. The uncomplicated concept is a virtue as is the modest running time. But best of all ""Monster House"" employs technology that allows for facial expressions and nuances of performance in its animated characters. Usually praising a movie about its new technology makes about as much sense as praising a movie for its old technology. Within a year or two all technology becomes old technology and the reasons that a movie is good or bad have a lot to do with how the technology is used and little to do with the technology itself. But this ""motion-capture"" process first seen in ""The Polar Express"" constitutes a creative breakthrough as well as a technological one. Animated films always had the advantage of being able to go anywhere and show anything to defy the laws of physics and follow the imagination as far as it could go. But they never had the ability to show the human face. There was never any point to a close-up in an animated film -- there was never really anything to see. But with the motion-capture process real actors give their performances with computer sensors attached to their face and body and that recorded information becomes the template for the computer animation. If an actor is bug-eyed the character will look bug-eyed. Moreover if the actor is thinking or is full of doubt the technology will be able to render subtle qualities of pensiveness or doubt in the animation. Imagine what Disney might have done with this in the creation of the Seven Dwarfs. Imagine all the things that will be done with this in the future. ""Monster House"" looks like the ground floor of something important. The movie itself isnt quite so important but its pleasing. The story is about a boy DJ (Mitchel Musso) who is fixated on the neighbor across the street Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) a crotchety crank who raves at kids to get off his property and confiscates every toy or ball that rolls onto his lawn. Like several of the characters in this film Mr. Nebbercracker has bad teeth. Were all familiar with the perfect gleaming teeth that every animated character has had since the beginning of time from Speed Racer on up through the cars in ""Cars."" Well ""Monster House"" breaks that convention. In fact it may break it too much -- it gets a little gross. The motion-capture process is put to good use in the sequence in which DJs best friend Chowder (Sam Lerner) comes to visit -- he looks a little like the chubby earnest Samwise in ""The Lord of the Rings"" -- and they play basketball in the driveway. Chowders uncoordinated movements are funnier as animation than they would have been in live action. Their verisimilitude makes them funny. Its the kick of watching a cartoon look awkward in exactly the same way as a human being. When the ball rolls onto Mr. Nebbercrackers property the adventure begins. The boys are joined by Jenny (Spencer Locke) a girl who is about their age but several inches taller than they are -- a familiar habit of 12-year-old girls. When the adults prove useless as they always do the kids must figure out whats happening and what should be done as the house gets hungrier and more uncontrollable. At first its wooden panels stretch and twist into a kind of grimace. Then it starts using its hall runner to snatch up people and pull them inside. ""Monster House"" was designed as a family movie and a scary movie. It may scare children but it wont terrify them. So its no scarier than it should be. -- Advisory Mildly scary situations.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor July 21 2006 Save for later Saved The new animated feature ""Monster House"" has as its executive producers Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg but the real star is its first-time 29-year-old director Gil Kenan whose last film was a 400 student short at UCLA film school.""Monster House"" extends the motion-capture animation technique utilizing actors in wet suits acting on a sound stage that was first employed by Zemeckis in his ""Polar Express.""As ""Polar Express"" demonstrated the resulting blend of live-action and computer-generated imagery has an otherworldly aspect that may not always be appropriate to the story. But for ""Monster House"" which is about a very cranky old mans suburban house that comes to life the technique provides a perfect comingling of comedy and horror. The result has the visceral effect of a thrill ride at the amusement park. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Sometimes the thriller aspects get a bit out of hand. When 12-year-old DJ and his friend Chowder finally get the goods on Mr. Nebbercrackers house it unmoors itself and rampages through the neighborhood. The movie temporarily turns into ""King Kong."" Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 But Kenan never loses sight of the wonderment that children (and adults) experience when the inanimate becomes animate. Anthropomorphism is basic to the art of animation. So is a good story and Kenan has that too although one character a black policeman is uncomfortably close to racial caricature. The ""cast"" for the film including Steve Buscemi Maggie Gyllenhaal Catherine OHara and Fred Willard is tiptop. If ""Polar Express"" put you off motion-capture animation ""Monster House"" should put you back on.

The mysterious manse that gets star billing in the smartly delirious animated thriller Monster House is possessed of windows like eyes and a flying bit of carpet that unfurls tonguelike out the front door to scoop up trespassers. Mr. Nebbercracker (voiced by Steve Buscemi) the old coot who lives inside is only a minor meanie compared with this house that roars at three brave little neighborhood kids. (Other stars supplying vocals include Maggie Gyllenhaal Kathleen Turner and Napoleon Dynamites Jon Heder whos sweeeet as a videogaming pizza flunky.) Feature first-timer Gil Kenan directs with a zingy sense of kids comedy fright and visual perspective. But the movie also shimmers and shakes in all its motion-capture animated beauty with the slyly deep sensibilities of executive producer Robert Zemeckis. (Zemeckis not-too-shabby fellow exec prod is Steven Spielberg.) Emotional darkness doesnt just loom in a Zemeckis movie -- it taunts it surprises it winks and sometimes it flashes a skull grin when drawn as in Cast Away onto the surface of a ball called Wilson. It just so happens a Wilson spheroid is gobbled up in Monster House too How freaky and how fun.

"A Condemned House washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On A Condemned House Three kids face off against an evil dwelling in ""Monster House."" (Sony Pictures Imageworks) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday July 21 2006 ""Monster House""  Who is it good for? Way too scary for anyone younger than 10 but somehow too childish to appeal to tweens ""Monster House"" falls into a middle even mushier -- albeit less hellacious -- than that of the titular house itself. The animated story of a boy who discovers that the house across the way is a monster with a voracious appetite for children just his age ""Monster House"" is a grisly often cynical piece of work whose joyless aggressive spirit is made even less appealing by its soulless visual style. Steve Buscemi provides the voice of Mr. Nebbercracker a freakishly frightening elderly man (think one part Mr. Wilson one part Boo Radley) who regularly confiscates any ball bicycle or other errant toy that falls on his pristine lawn. When young DJ (Mitchel Musso) runs afoul of Nebbercracker he realizes that its the house not its owner who is the real neighborhood malefactor. On the eve of Halloween DJ and two friends set out to solve the mystery. What unfolds is by turns tiresome and terrifying as the house comes to creepy life and its back story -- gothic to the point of grotesqueness -- is revealed. Despite its obvious nods to Robert Zemeckis and Tim Burton and some notable cameo appearances (Kathleen Turner Maggie Gyllenhaal Jon Heder) ""Monster House"" is an eyesore. -- Ann Hornaday Monster House PG 91 minutes Contains scary images and sequences thematic elements crude humor and brief profanity.

Constant shock cuts and souped-up sound effects will keep small fry in a state of moderate petrification while the trio of tweeny leads plus attitude-redolent cohorts will make teens feel welcome spelling peppy summer B.O. returns for this Halloween-set haunted-house tale. Some sharp talent and technique has been applied to an old chestnut of a story in ""Monster House"" an increasingly resistable thrill-ride-style comic horrorfest. Godfathered by Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg supremely slick but overly in-your-face first feature by recent UCLA grad Gil Kenan reps the latest in the motion-capture animation process popularized by Zemeckis in ""The Polar Express."" Constant shock cuts and souped-up music and sound effects will keep small fry in a state of moderate petrification while the trio of tweeny leads plus attitude-redolent cohorts will make teens feel welcome spelling peppy summer B.O. returns for this Halloween-set haunted-house tale. Kenan came to industry attention via his 2002 UCLA senior year short ""The Lark"" a live-action/animated horror fantasy that evinced a mindset well suited to Dan Harmon Rob Schrab and Pamela Pettlers script (originally written for a live-action feature) about a mean-spirited house thats actually alive. Helmer shows off his visual aptitude in the opening shot which follows a red autumn leaf as it falls toward the ground in a pristine suburban neighborhood -- pristine that is save for an old dark house flanked by rows of barren trees that no one dares approach. Its fearsome owner is Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi) a skinny dentally deprived hermit who in the first scene terrorizes a little girl and destroys her tricycle. All this is observed from across the street by DJ (Mitchel Musso) a lanky 12-year-old who with his chubby buddy Chowder (Sam Lerner) decides to challenge the eccentric old man. In the resulting altercation Nebbercracker suffers an apparently fatal seizure and is carted away. But thats just the beginning of the threat posed by the house. When trespassed upon the place reacts in a variety of antisocial ways The lawn can suck things underground and the facade takes on an unnaturally human visage with two upper windows as eyes a peak above the porch roof as a nose and the front door as a mouth out of which rolls a lengthy tongue-like carpet with frog-like snatching ability. Some relatively deserving characters fall prey to the houses voracious appetite beginning with Bones (Jason Lee) the amusingly odious b.f. of DJs punky babysitter Zee (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and a couple of cops (Kevin James Nick Cannon) who in classic Abbott and Costello mode refuse for the longest time to believe what everyone else knows the house is doing. Alert ""Harry Potter"" fans will notice the script shamelessly lifts the prime personality traits of J.K. Rowlings three most important young characters for its lead trio Tall dark-haired serious-minded DJ is Harry semi-dufus Chowder is Ron and their new cohort smarty-pants prep school redhead Jenny (Spencer Locke) is Hermione. Together they lay siege to the house penetrating its deepest secrets including the reason it can assume ""human"" and ultimately mobile form. After shooting with live actors for 42 days in a ""black box"" soundstage to achieve credible movements and expressions filmmakers then computer-animated both the environments and the thesps to give the picture its distinctive look. Characters are generally more facially nuanced than were those in ""The Polar Express"" an asset amplified by the overall excellent vocal work by a tasty ensemble of performers that also includes Kathleen Turner Jon Heder Catherine OHara and Fred Willard. Pics technical and design achievement is estimable. But the overriding impression is assaultive to a progressively off-putting degree. Kenan keeps hammering away with stun-gun cuts visual ammo suddenly flying in from out of frame and ear-splitting sound effects and music cues to the point where at least part of the audience will want to tune out. In this respect it is a theme-park ride with shocks and jolts provided with reliable regularity. Across 90 minutes however the experience is desensitizing and dispiriting and far too insistent. Quite a few shots look specifically composed for maximum effectiveness in 3-D a process in which the pic will be shown in numerous situations.
