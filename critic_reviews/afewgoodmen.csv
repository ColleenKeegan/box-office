"Full Court Press - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Full Court Press`A Few Good Men` Is More Than Genre SpecificDecember 11 1992|By Dave Kehr.It`s probably time to declare a moratorium on the courtroom drama just because it`s too darn easy to do.The trial format with its clearly delineated good guys and bad guys uninterrupted succession of emotional confrontations and steady climb toward a win-or-lose climax automatically imposes dramatic structure and suspense on just about any issue from first-degree murder to city zoning variances.On second thought perhaps that moratorium should be imposed right after the release of ``A Few Good Men`` a courtroom drama-actually a court-martial room drama-that proves the form is still in fine working order providing its predictable pleasures.Like all of the feature films directed by Rob Reiner-``Stand by Me````The Princess Bride`` ``When Harry Met Sally . . .``-this new effort takes a well-established formula and simply gives it an earnest professional mounting.Reiner has not risen to the top of his profession by taking chances on material or challenging his audience with unexpected twists. One of his earliest films was titled ``The Sure Thing`` and Reiner has followed that prescription ever since.Already a critical and commercial success in its Broadway incarnation``A Few Good Men`` has been adapted to the screen by its author Aaron Sorkin. The piece takes as its theme the conflict between the individual liberty sacred to Americans and the total discipline demanded by the military. But the ideas involved are largely an excuse to bring together two powerhouse male roles-that of a flinty implacable career officer Col. Nathan R. Jessep (Jack Nicholson) and the young unformed and undisciplined Navy lawyer Lt. j.g. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) who must confront him.Shooting in carefully balanced widescreen compositions (the browned-out cinematography is by ``JFK```s Robert Richardson) and cutting in occasional dignity-conferring views of Washington landmarks Reiner slips into a smoothly impersonal classical style. Only a few awkwardly placed flashbacks-to depict the crime in question and tip the audience off to a cover-up-interrupt the steady straight line of the action.Kaffee is an unkempt junior staffer in the Washington bureau of the Navy`s legal department who uses his gifts as a charming plea-bargainer in order to buy himelf more time for softball practice. Assigned to the case of two young Marines (James Marshall and Wolfgang Bodison) who have been accused of killing one of their weaker fellows in the course of an illegal disciplinary action Kaffee is at first inclined to cop a plea and settle for token sentences.But with the help of fiesty co-counselors Lt. Cmdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) and Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) Kaffee comes to realize that he has been given the case for exactly that reason-to sell out his clients and thus protect their superior officer Col. Jessep the politically connected commander of the sensitive Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba from any hint of scandal.Sorkin seems to have written the part of Kaffee for a slightly older more sophisticated actor with a sarcastic humor and sense of cynical resignation that Tom Cruise simply doesn`t possess.But Cruise`s youth and relative immaturity turn out to serve the secret undercurrents of the film extremely well. Matched against Nicholson-who is perfectly cast and exploits his brief screen time to create a volcanic impression-Cruise nudges the material toward its hidden dimension that of a conflict between two generations of Americans and more significantly between two generations of American actors.That the struggle is essentially an Oedipal battle is made clear by Sorkin`s frequent allusions to Kaffee`s father a legendary civil rights lawyer whose commitment and idealism are exactly what the younger man lacks and exactly what the drama helps him recover.Standing in for the admired/resented father is Nicholson`s Jessep a rigid authoritarian who chomps compulsively on a comically huge phallic cigar (surely this must be Nicholson`s little joke).By pitting Cruise against Nicholson in the film`s final courtroom confrontation Sorkin and Reiner are pitting two notions of masculinity and two notions of stardom against each other.Nicholson represents the high-flying `60s rebel steeped in Method techniques and testosterone commanding authority because he demands attention and demands respect.Cruise embodies the smooth insinuating conformism of the `80s using a low-key low-intensity sitcom charm to work his way into the affections of his audience and win it over.This is precisely the sort of clearly delineated black-and-white conflict that the courtroom drama deals with most effectively dividing the issues straight down the middle as it builds to the final decision.``A Few Good Men`` works because it`s able to draw so many side issues into its central conflict spreading its concerns culture-wide.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesDont call Demi Moore a cougarNovember 10 2009Ray Liotta to star in ""Family of the Year"" for ""Big Fat...May 20 2003Bruce Willis Dont count on me TweetingSeptember 30 2009Find More Stories AboutFull-court PressTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-11/entertainment/9204220853_1_daniel-kaffee-reiner-demi-moore,200,afewgoodmen0,afewgoodmen,chicagotribune
"MOVIE REVIEW  Two of the Best Men  Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise star in an old-fashioned military courtroom drama that is a tribute to pure star power. - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW  Two of the Best Men  Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise star in an old-fashioned military courtroom drama that is a tribute to pure star power.December 11 1992|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC ""A Few Good Men"" takes you back. Way back. A brisk and familiar courtroom drama of the old school as pleasant to watch as it is predictable ""Men"" more than anything else is a tribute to pure star power an assured reminder of the days when actors played by the rules and didnt hesitate to do the things audiences liked to see them doing.Centered like ""The Caine Mutiny"" before it around a trial inside a military courtroom ""A Few Good Men"" (citywide) would like you to think its about such weighty topics as the misuse of power and a young mans struggle to find himself but no one will be coming out of theaters whistling those tunes. Rather this films true reason for being is to give Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise old lion and young pretender the kinds of juicy roles they do best and then turn them loose to rock and roll.For those who wondered what Cruise was up to wandering around Ireland in funny clothes and an uncertain accent hes back in business as Navy Lt. J.G. Daniel Kaffee a self-confident wiseacre with a million-watt smile who could be the separated-at-birth twin of ""Top Guns"" cocky Maverick. Its a persona Cruise knows inside out but rather than walk through the part he attacks it with vigor and one of the achievements of both Aaron Sorkins script and Rob Reiners direction is that they found ways to rekindle the actors interest in such a well-worn dramatic stance. For the Record Los Angeles Times Monday December 14 1992 Home Edition Calendar Part F Page 4 Column 4 Entertainment Desk 1 inches; 22 words Type of Material Correction Wrong photographer--A photograph of Tom Cruise in Fridays Calendar section was credited to the wrong photographer. The photographer was Michele Singer.As enjoyably energetic as Cruise is Nicholson goes him one better. A performer with more experience (and more range) Nicholson is capable of all manner of movie star brassiness and his pivotal albeit supporting role as man-eating Marine Col. Nathan R. Jessup is a treat the kind of showy self-confident acting that awards were made for and that this picture would be in serious trouble without.Before we get to either Nicholson or Cruise a little plotting is in order. ""Men"" (rated R for language) opens on the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay Cuba. Two pairs of hurried footsteps are heard on a Marine barracks hallway a door is opened a frightened young man is roused from his bed his mouth and wrists roughly taped and then everything is darkness.Cut to stateside and Lt. Cmdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore in a brisk buttoned-down performance). A military attorney with more passion than street smarts she wants desperately to defend those two young men from Guantanamo. They have been charged with murder the fellow Marine whose mouth they taped having died soon after the attack. For the accused it turns out are not troublemakers but recruiting poster Marines the good guys and Galloway suspects that an ominous tradition called a Code Red was the real cause of that accidental death.The Navy (which though no one bothers to explain it has legal jurisdiction over the Marines) has other plans. The Marines defense is handed over to Lt. Kaffee (Cruise) a breezy type just out of law school. More interested in plea bargaining than in defending anyone and more interested in softball than in anything he and junior counsel Lt. Sam Weinberg (a quietly amusing Kevin Pollak) figure this case will not be a severe drain on their time.They figure without Kaffees military superior the other half of this odd couple legal team the bulldog Lt. Cmdr. Galloway. Irritated by the young mans insolent who-cares attitude she keeps yapping at him until he takes both her and the case seriously.And dont forget Col. Jessup (Nicholson) the hard-case Marine commander down at Guantanamo who is not shy about saying that he eats breakfast each and every morning eyeball to eyeball with ever so many armed Cubans whod love to wax his hide. In fact more interesting than this films story (and more believable) is its back story the portrayal of a world of spit-and-polish fanatics who believe in their military culture of honor and violence and their harsh code of behavior with a fervor usually reserved for more spiritual matters.While watching Nicholson and Cruise chew on each other and gnaw on the scenery is quite a treat everything in ""A Few Good Men"" doesnt work as efficiently as their performances. The films plot taken from Sorkins long-running Broadway play is more contrived than creditable motivations are not always clear and some characters for instance Kiefer Sutherland as a praise the lord and pass the ammunition Marine are not very convincingly acted.Yet director Reiner has more than enough professionalism at his command as well as a shrewd feel for the mechanics of mass entertainment to involve us in his tale. To be in a tense courtroom and hear confident attorneys cuttingly say ""Your witness"" as they make haughty experts squirm is always a pleasure. Though it would be a mistake to get too excited over what for all its grand designs remains an uncomplicated piece of entertainment simple pleasures like these are getting harder and harder to find.A Few Good MenTom Cruise Lt.

If the whole thing seems a little too tried-and-true well it is but what do you want from Hollywood - originality?Based on Aaron Sorkins successful 1989 Broadway play (and adapted by the playwright) this military trial whydunit has been ably assembled by Rob Reiner whose stab at the genre is every bit as assured (and commercial) as his previous forays into coming-of-age tales (Stand by Me) urban romance (When Harry Met Sally . . . ) and Stephen King sadomasochism (Misery). Although it doesnt appear that Reiner will ever again direct with the improvisational nuttiness that marked his mock-documentary debut This Is Spinal Tap the second-generation Hollywood filmmaker has become one of the most dependable storytellers in the business.In A Few Good Men Cruise doing another take on his boyish smart-alecky persona (how long can this go on?) is Lt. j.g. Daniel Kaffee a Navy lawyer with an impressive record of plea bargains - so impressive in fact that in his 15 months out of Harvard Law he has yet to bring a case to trial. Cruise chugs Yoo-hoos and chomps impudently on apples - hes the Mr. Hotshot the Top Gunslinger cynical before his time.Nicholson sporting a buzzy tuft of Marine-issue hair and gnawing on a Sgt. Fury cigar plays Nathan R. Jessep commanding officer of the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay Cuba. Under Jesseps watch a roundly disliked private has been killed in a ""Code Red"" incident - Marine jargon for an act of peer- administered discipline - and two Marines have been charged in his death.Moore is JoAnne Galloway a Navy internal- affairs attorney who is eager to represent the two soldiers - and who is passed over for the glib Kaffee who happens to be the son of a former Navy legend and U.S. attorney general. Thus the necessary dramatic tension between Cruise and Moore - made all the more dramatic and tense when Moores character finesses her way onto the legal team anyhow. (And thus the not-so-necessary father-son stuff thats slathered thickly onto the Cruise characters psychology.)Set on the Guantanamo Bay base but mostly in a Washington Navy courtroom A Few Good Men addresses some tough moral issues about the not always compatible worlds of military and constitutional justice. There is no doubt that the two men being court-martialed (played by James Marshall and a very effective Wolfgang Bodison) were physically responsible for the victims death but there is every doubt about who holds ultimate responsibility for the act.Although officially disdained ""Code Reds"" were standard practice in hard-nosed platoon life and the whole case smacks of a coverup to protect the bemedaled Col. Jessep whose career trajectory is pointed toward a seat on the National Security Council. Will the cocky young Kaffee opt for an easy plea or will his better instincts - and his innate talent as a courtroom tactician - take hold? If you vote for the early plea leave the theater and go see Under Siege.A fairly long and knotty drama A Few Good Men boasts some strong supporting performances (Kiefer Sutherland plays a nasty Marine lieutenant with heretofore unseen ferociousness and comic actor Christopher Guest is virtually unrecognizable as a perjured Navy doctor). There is also a notably implausible turn by J.T. Walsh as a key witness for the defense. (Its not Walsh whos implausible - just the character; his Lt. Col. Markinson is more of a dramatic device than a believably tormented career combat officer.)Robert Richardson longtime Oliver Stone cinematographer doesnt dazzle you with busywork but the film has a handsomeness befitting its marquee stature. And Richardsons frequent closeups - especially during the final courtroom confrontation between Cruise and Nicholson - have a risky intensity. The literally in-your-face camera work can easily expose an actors weaknesses but with the lens framed on Nicholsons bulldog visage he lets loose with volcanic fury. His demagoguery and gung-ho self-righteousness are something to behold.This is Nicholsons Captain Queeg and if A Few Good Men isnt quite The Caine Mutiny it certainly honors the tradition.A FEW GOOD MEN   Produced by David Brown Rob Reiner and Andrew Scheinman directed by Reiner written by Aaron Sorkin photography by Robert Richardson music by Marc Shaiman distributed by Columbia Pictures.Running time 2 hours 18 mins.Lt. j.g.

`A Few Good Men` Has Several Fine Moments - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs `A Few Good Men` Has Several Fine MomentsDecember 11 1992|By Gene Siskel.Our Flick of the Week is ``A Few Good Men`` which should prove-if it still needs to be-that Tom Cruise is a fine actor capable of a laser intensity that overrides his good looks. His concluding courtroom scene with Jack Nicholson which is Nicholson`s biggest moment in the picture turns into a showcase for Cruise`s ability to focus. We feel his presence even when he`s not on camera.Based on a hit Broadway play which in turn was based on a real-life incident ``A Few Good Men`` is a court-martial drama about a Marine hazing incident that results in the death of a young soldier at an American base in Cuba. Accused of murder are the two soldiers who did the hazing.Nicholson plays the gung-ho base commander whose permissive attitude toward such harassment may have at the very least created a climate in which such a tragedy could occur. And that`s the argument put forth in the soldiers` trial by Cruise playing a hot-shot Washington-based Navy lawyer assigned to defend them. Assisting Cruise is another young Navy lawyer played by Demi Moore. To the script`s credit they do not have a romance.Rather the driving force of the story is watching Cruise`s character develop some backbone and staying power. His pattern has been to settle cases out of court; this time he will choose to fight for what he believes is right. The story is cleanly told by Rob Reiner who quickly has become one of Hollywood`s more polished commercial directors.``A Few Good Men`` is playing at the Burnham Plaza Esquire Pipers Alley and outlying theaters.

Few Good Men Is Timely Terrific Courtroom Drama - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Tom Cruise Few Good Men Is Timely Terrific Courtroom DramaMOVIES - REVIEW - A Few Good Men -  - Cast Tom Cruise Jack Nicholson Demi Moore Kevin Bacon Kiefer Sutherland Kevin Pollak. - Director Rob Reiner. - Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. - Cinematographer Robert Richardson. - Music Marc Shaiman. - Running time 2 hours 20 minutes. - Industry rating R (restricted). - Parents guide Extreme language brief violence.December 11 1992|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticWith the mission to Somalia the fallout from the Tailhook scandal and the prospect of gays serving openly in the armed forces all making headlines everyone has become rather military-conscious lately.A Few Good Men which opens today is just the right movie to come along at this moment.Written by Aaron Sorkin - based on his Broadway play - this nail-biter of a courtroom drama concerns the legal maneuvers that follow the arrest of two Marines for apparently causing the death of a fellow platoon member. A gripping and provocative film A Few Good Men taps into the unresolved feelings that many people harbor when it comes to military mattersIf we want an armed force that is ready to kill or die at a moments notice can we require from its members the same standard of decency that we expect from civilians?Tom Cruise is cast as the young Navy lawyer assigned to defend the accused Marines; Demi Moore and Kevin Pollak play attorneys on the defense team; and Jack Nicholson portrays the commander of the Navy base at Guantanamo Bay Cuba where the killing takes place. Much of the strength of the film is in Sorkins literate hard-edged script which contains several terrific roles - roles that most actors would kill or die to play.Except for Cruise - who unfortunately has the lead - all of them rise to the challenge splendidly.Actually Cruise has much of what it takes to play the attractive unserious callow shrewd intelligent and verbal Lt. Daniel Kaffee. He can easily handle the first four of these qualities and can pretty much fake the fifth.The crucial sixth is the problem Theres nothing about Cruises portrait of the Harvard-educated Kaffee that suggests someone who loves and understands language.The rhythms of conversation yes; the words themselves sorry. Even though screenwriter Sorkin chooses Kaffees words carefully Cruise doesnt speak them as if Kaffee does.Cruise is especially weak in the climactic courtroom showdown between Kaffee and Nicholsons character - a scene that hinges on Kaffees choice of words and which should have been the films high point. Still Cruise gives the role his all and hes rather amusing in another scene in which he pulls off a canny Nicholson impression.Is it a contradiction to say that a movie is terrific even though the lead is weak? Maybe but thats what we have with A Few Good Men.Somehow the script Cruises performance in those scenes that he can handle the other performances and Rob Reiners craftsmanlike direction (which respects both script and actors) count for a lot. And as much as you may wish that John Cusack or a younger William Hurt had the lead that simply isnt how box-office casting works.In any case the other actors are generous with Cruise They seem to want to help him not seem to want to help him not show him up.As Lt. Cmdr. JoAnne Galloway Demi Moore gives a subtle measured performance the key to which is the characters self-consciousness. Galloway is always a little awkward which helps explain why she both distrusts Kaffees ultra-smoothness and is at the same time drawn to it.And in what might have been the extremely minor role of Lt. Sam Weinberg Kaffees assistant and friend comedian Kevin Pollak (Avalon) brings a wise humorous presence to the film. Also contributing notable performances are Kiefer Sutherland (whose ears look really weird when hes sporting a military haircut) as a redneck J.T. Walsh as a mysterious high-ranking officer Kevin Bacon as the prosecutor Christopher Guest as a key medical witness and as the accused Marines Wolfgang Bodison and James Marshall.As you may have suspected Jack Nicholson steals the show. His Col. Nathan Jessep isnt in a lot of scenes but when hes there you cant take your eyes off him.Col. Jesseps motto is Walk softly and carry an armored tank division and thats basically Nicholsons motto too. As Jessep he walks - and talks - softly but he has plenty of acting firepower deployed.To the extent that the final showdown between Jessep and Kaffee works it works because Nicholsons entire performance leads up to it. You watch his glaring Capt. Bligh eyes throughout the film and you see a man who could boil over with rage at any moment.And yet somehow does not - not yet anyway.With his hair trimmed to military specifications Nicholsons eyes stand out more strongly than ever and his aging face looks especially jowly. When he is his most keenly ironic you glimpse madness beneath the surface - a bit of the Joker peeps out.What do you want to discuss now? Jessep asks with studied weariness when Kaffees questions to him on the stand seem to go nowhere. My favorite color?Sarcasm this strong could halt a tank division.

Screenplay by Aaron Sorkin based on his play. Cinerama Northgate Lewis amp; Clark Kirkland Parkplace Alderwood Crossroads SeaTac 12 South Factoria Kent 6. ""R"" - restricted due to profanity subject matter. --------------------------------------------------------------- Pitting Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson against each other is about as close as you can come to guaranteed entertainment. ""A Few Good Men"" also has the pedigree of its initial success as an acclaimed Broadway play and director Rob Reiner has the reputation and skill necessary to nurture a first-rate conversion to the big screen. The films entire cast and crew prove up to the task and theres something both comfortably old-fashioned (right up to the now rare closing title ""The End"") and blazingly contemporary about Aaron Sorkins screenplay which according to the playwright is an improvement on his original work. The makings of a riveting courtroom drama are intensified by its military context beginning with the murder of a fledgling Marine stationed on base at Guantanamo Bay Cuba. After threatening to report the on-duty infraction of a fellow soldier the young Marine had fallen victim to an unsanctioned punishment called a ""Code Red"" and the two Marines held responsible are put on trial. Defending them in military court is a sharp hotshot Navy lawyer named Kaffee (a role tailor-made for Cruise) who is barely a year out of Harvard and struggling to emerge from the long shadow of his fathers stellar legal reputation. Reckless but eager to prove himself Kaffee is whipped into shape by his Navy defense supervisor (Demi Moore) until he realizes hes being set up as a stooge who is expected to plea-bargain without noticing the cases true significance. Fat chance. The scent of the crime leads to a righteous fundamentalist Marine lieutenant (Kiefer Sutherland) and his commanding officer Col. Jessep (Nicholson). With further assistance by his defense partner (Kevin Pollak) and a ""Deep Throat""-like officer close to the case (J.T. Walsh) Kaffee prepares for a courtroom showdown during which the definitions of honor and duty are put to an extreme test. Its volatile stuff energized by traditional inter-service rivalries and Sorkins vividly plotted details are nicely balanced with dialogue that springs from the heightened reality of a Hollywood-ized star vehicle while remaining authentic. The cases intense focus nicely restrains the expected Moore-Cruise romance which is clearly implied through their witty love-hate banter but not at the expense of the tightly wound story. Though still clearly a play-turned-film ""A Few Good Men"" has been cautiously and effectively ""opened up"" by Reiner and cinematographer Robert Richardson (Oliver Stones regular cameraman) whose virtuosity is most evident within the confines of the courtroom where delicate camera moves and impeccable editing turn this into a tinderbox trial favorably comparable to ""The Caine Mutiny."" Whereas Bogart was a nervous paranoid wreck in that film Nicholson is utterly explosive a cornered pit bull convinced that his power - and his conviction regarding national defense - supersedes all higher truths. Sorkins precise writing allows Nicholson to do what may be his best dramatic work since (dare I say it?) ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest."" Its a bonus that his climactic speech is provocative and thematically potent but the supreme pleasure lies in witnessing a master at the peak of his craft. Its scenery-chewing to be sure and Cruise gets his own chance to hog the spotlight in powerhouse scenes that merely enhance the vitality of his best previous roles. Its Cruises movie and his All-American flash makes it easy to ignore his characters instant and unlikely transformation into a courtroom ace. This kind of maneuvering (which duly impresses the prosecuting attorney nicely played by Kevin Bacon) takes years of trial experience but hey this is a movie remember? Just go with the flow and leave the minor faults to the nitpickers. Copyright (c) 1992 Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved.

Comments A Few Good Men Rated R  138 minutes Im usually a sucker for courtroom dramas but Rob Reiners highly mechanical 1992 feature filmed by numbers from Aaron Sorkins adaptation of his own cliched and fatuous Broadway play kept putting me to sleep. A glib rookie navy lawyer (Tom Cruise) who has grown up in the shadow of his celebrated navy-lawyer father is assigned to defend two marines against charges of murdering a member of their platoon; Demi Moore plays a member of his defense team and Jack Nicholson--who gets costar billing for walking through three short scenes--plays the hard-nosed colonel ultimately responsible for the death.

Walsh; Director Rob Reiner; Author Aaron Sorkin; Producer (group) Castle Rock Productions Columbia Pictures New Line Cinema; Runtime (in minutes) 138; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted December 18 1992 -- 1200 AM EST At some point in any Tom Cruise movie theres the pivotal moment when Cruise having displayed his Cockiness and Callow Youth realizes its time to hunker down and fly that plane/mix that drink/protest that war/win that land rush. In A Few Good Men the moment takes place in court -- Cruise realizes hes got to win that trial -- only its not the setting thats new. Its whats going on in Cruise. He plays Lieut. Daniel Kaffee an arrogant young navy lawyer assigned to defend two stoic Marines accused of murder. The raw facts of the case arent in dispute. The defendants Lance Corporal Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) and Private First Class Downey (James Marshall) have admitted they entered the room of one of their platoon member stuffed a rag down his throat and left him bound and gagged. Approximately half and hour later he was dead. What Kaffee has learned though is the two men were without murderous intent. They were engaged in the common -- if unofficial -- practice of Marine discipline known as ""code red"" in which platoon members orchestrate a kind of sanctioned hazing physically abusing any recruit who has fallen short of standards. (Its their way of getting him back in line.) It appears too that the defendants were acting on orders from their supervising officer (Kiefer Sutherland) -- and whats more that he was following a directive from the base commander Col. Nathan R. Jessep (Jack Nicholson) a self-righteous autocrat who understands only too well that military authority derives from elaborate gamesmanship. Now Kaffee has put Jessep on the stand. To win the case he needs to prove that Jessep ordered the code red. Theres just one problem Kaffee has no proof -- and if he doesnt nail Jessep to the wall his military career will probably end in disgrace. As Cruise and Nicholson bear down on each other the movie becomes intricate and electrifying meeting of the minds. Since were seeing the action through Kaffees eyes -- through the hair-trigger shifts in his legal strategy -- the scene depends on our belief in his nimble intellectual powers. We have to buy the fact that he can outmanipulate a master manipulation. And damned if Cruise doesnt bring it off. In A Few Good Men this young superstar performs with his usual brashness (he tosses of his lines like guitar riffs) only now its laced with a hurtling mental agility. His performance has rhythm and verve. By the end of the movie were convinced that Kaffee is at once a classic Cruise hotshot and a great lawyer and that the two are inseparable. Directed by Rob Reiner from Aaron Sorkins adaptation of his hit Broadway play A Few Good Men is a thrillingly effective crowd pleaser. Like all courtroom dramas its gimmicky and on some essential level synthetic. Its really an elaborate piece of construction with too many links to earlier Cruise vehicles (the business with Kaffee living in the shadow of his deceased lawyer father is just leftover Top Gun). Yet when a courtroom drama has been made with this much skill and star power its an irresistible throwback to the sort of sharp-edged entertainment Hollywood once provided with regularity (and these days has just forgotten how to make). The premise -- a legal inquisition on a military base -- is hardly original. It recalls A Soldiers Story and most famous The Caine Mutiny (both of which were also done in stage versions) in which Humphrey Bogart had a great wormy performance as Captain Queeg the paranoid disciplinarian whos the most obvious model for Nicholsons Colonel Jessep. Yet unlike those films A Few Good Men goes out of its way not to turn into an elemental indictment of military ethics. Form the opening-credit sequence in which a row of Marines enact a rifle-twirling drill with hypnotic synchroneity the movie recognizes that theres something powerful and compelling about the mechanized fanaticism of Marine discipline. The two young defendants are ready to go to jail for life rather than be dishonored. Were asked to view the Marines with respectful ambiguity as trained supermen who possess courage that can easily slide off into fascist self-regard. Its the actors who carry the day. Nicholson pushes his scene-stealing sarcasm to lethal extremes. He isnt on screen long but his performance has a menacing vitality. We look into the eyes of this hostile imperious colonel and think yes hes a Marine -- he knows what it means to kill somebody (and more than that to want to). Kevin Bacon as the prosecutor acts with a sly self-depreciation thats funny and winning and Kiefer Sutherland ears jutting out from his head like malignant growths plays a Marine zealot with scary conviction. As the Navy lawyer forced to work with Kaffe when shed rather take on the case herself Demi Moore has the one thankless role (shes just there to flirt with Cruise) but she carries it off with panache; she helps humanize Kaffee. As for Cruise this may be his best performance to date. In the wrong role he can be hideously inadequate -- trying to express Deep Spiritual Anguish in Born on the Fourth of July he was like a high school jock impersonating Marlon Brando. But when he gets to parade his quick-spririted bravado and to show some urgency and cunning besides he proves that in his sleeker-than-life way hes an actor as well as a star.

Its got all the elements for across-the-boards acceptance -- juicy parts for some of the top stars in the business a Broadway pedigree a riveting David-vs.-Goliath courtroom battle serious attitudes that wont threaten or offend anyone and skilled filmmaking hands at the top of their game. ""A Few Good Men"" is a big-time mainstream Hollywood movie par excellence. Its got all the elements for across-the-boards acceptance -- juicy parts for some of the top stars in the business a Broadway pedigree a riveting David-vs.-Goliath courtroom battle serious attitudes that wont threaten or offend anyone and skilled filmmaking hands at the top of their game. Fact that it covers such familiar ground and takes no risks wont in any way constrain this Columbia/Castle Rock entry from promotion to the top B.O. ranks. Mass audiences will eat up this expose of peacetime military malfeasance laced with the story of a bright young lawyers struggle to get out from under the imposing shadow of an illustrious father. Expert story construction and compelling thesping and direction make all the narrative elements pay off as if calculated by a precision instrument in which all the parts are working perfectly. Adapting his 1989 play which ran for 449 performances on Broadway Aaron Sorkin has opened it up just enough to accommodate the requirements of the big screen and magnified the psychological father-son dilemma of the leading character to lend him more dimension. Otherwise the same histrionic fireworks that gripped theater audiences will prove even more compelling to filmgoers due to the star power and dramatic screw-tightening. Populated virtually entirely by military characters tale has as its point of departure the death of a private at the Guantanamo Bay Cuba naval base. Two young Marines Dawson and Downey are quickly charged with murder as they appear to have gone too far in subjecting the victim to off-limits disciplinary action called ""Code Red"" for violating the chain of command in their platoon. Chosen to defend them is Navy lawyer and recent Harvard Law grad Lt. Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a hot dog who prefers baseball duds to military uniforms and enjoys an unblemished record of settling cases through plea bargains rather than in a courtroom. Briefly alighting in Cuba to interview the bases commanding officer Col. Nathan Jessep (Jack Nicholson) Kaffee barely goes through the motions of researching the case but is goaded by the driven special counsel Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) to press further and eventually to take on the top brass. Basically the defense team which also includes Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) has to show against heavy odds that Dawson and Downey were illegally ordered to inflict Code Red punishment on the victim and by whom. Making this seemingly impossible are the intransigent personalities of the officers in question the eminent ferocious Jessep and the hostile Lt. Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland) as well as the sudden unavailability of the one witness who could clear everything up Lt. Col. Markinson (J.T. Walsh). Action ping-pongs back and forth between defense team strategy sessions interrogations of the two perpetrators man-to-mans between Kaffee and the friendly but fiercely competitive and skilled prosecuting attorney Capt. Ross (Kevin Bacon) and raging exchanges in which Galloway wont let Kaffee off the hook prodding and belittling him into rising to the occasion. Kaffees problem in this regard is that his late father was a celebrated Navy lawyer himself. Afraid to take on his paternal competition Kaffee finds it infinitely easier to glide through life taking the easy way out getting drunk and avoiding confrontations that will test him. Never having tried a case before a judge hes putting himself as well as his clients at risk when he finally takes the floor always a good dramatic gambit. By the time of the climactic 15-minute courtroom showdown between Kaffee and Jessep the young man is in a hole so deep that viewers will be fairly drooling to find out how Kaffees going to turn the tables on his adversary. Sorkin delivers the goods in potent fashion and manages the nifty trick of making the audience feel as though it has experienced something considerably more sobering and profound than it really is. Major values such as honor good and evil commitment ethics God and country are repeatedly invoked and the dynamic way the narrative charges along makes it easy to overlook the fact that the text really doesnt have much to say about any of these things. To the extent that the play addresses any concerns at length it conservatively and reassuringly suggests that the existing system of checks and balances will ensure the endurance of the status quo in the military. But this is a well-made play well done in every respect. Director Rob Reiner hasnt missed a beat in extracting the most out the material and his actors. The characters repeated trajectories from rushes of excitement to the depths of despair will give audiences a fulfilling emotional rollercoaster ride and the underdog factor is played to the hilt. Kaffee is a perfect part for Tom Cruise and he engages it totally in giving his most passionate mature performance since ""Born on the Fourth of July."" Demi Moore proves a good challenging foil standing up to Kaffee with fire and authority. But the showiest turn is reserved for Nicholson and the crafty old pro makes more than the most of it. Playing a Marine lifer whos worked his way almost to the top and has long since mastered the art of pulling everyones strings Nicholson uses a few well-chosen tools-vocal sneer bared teeth arched eyebrows big stogie-to strike fear into the other characters and to spellbind the viewer. Hes only got three major scenes but theyre all dynamite. In fact everyone registers strongly. Kevin Bacon scores as the snappy intelligent prosecutor and Kiefer Sutherlands self-righteous good ol boy is no one youd want to meet in a dark alley. Acting newcomer Wolfgang Bodison and James Marshall are excellent as the youthful defendants while Kevin Pollak J.T. Walsh Christopher Guest and J.A. Preston all have their moments.

Witness Jack Nicholsons vicious funny superbly reptilian turn in Rob Reiners entertaining ""A Few Good Men"" adapted by Aaron Sorkin from his hit Broadway courtroom drama. Mr. Nicholson doesnt steal the film which would mean that he somehow separates himself from everybody else in it. Rather in the course of only a handful of scenes he seems to suffuse the entire production giving it a weight density and point that might not otherwise be apparent. The role beautifully written is made to Mr. Nicholsons order. Its that of Col. Nathan R. Jessep of the United States Marine Corps a tough bigoted Vietnam veteran a career officer shaped by decades of cold-war politics. By chance Jessep is stationed in that last corner of the earth where the cold war goes on as if there were no yesterday. Hes the commander of the marines stationed at the American naval base on the southwestern coast of Cuba at Guantanamo Bay on a small bit of arid real estate protecting one of the best anchorages in the western Atlantic a legacy of the Spanish-American War. Its there that the United States and Cuba separated by barbed wire and command posts have continued to co-exist through the Bay of Pigs invasion the great missile crisis and a continuing crippling economic embargo in one of the strangest examples of symbiosis to be found in all of international relations. This geographic fact becomes a central image in the film adaptation which gracefully opens up the story of a military court-martial without allowing the tension to evaporate. There are times when the movie seems to force-feed the audience essential information and when the audience might well wonder whether the emotional crises of the defense lawyers really are of more interest than the fates of the two men on trial. Yet such things are built into the structure and nature of the drama which is less about the workings of the military than about the mechanics of this particular inquiry. The story is this in the course of what appears to be a hazing incident at Guantanamo a Marine private has died apparently poisoned by the rag stuffed into his throat before his mouth was taped. Two enlisted men are charged with the murder. As often happens during proceedings of this sort the victim and the men on trial become less important than the politics surrounding the case. The Marine Corps would like to wrap it up as quickly and efficiently as possible. To this end a hot-shot young naval lawyer Lieut. (j.g.) Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) is assigned to the defense with the understanding that hell persuade the defendants to accept a plea bargain. Also assigned to the defense is Lieut. Comdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) who acts as Kaffees conscience eventually persuading him that there is a strong possibility that the two enlisted men were in fact acting on orders from their officers. The investigation initially undertaken by Kaffee with some reluctance uncovers the fact that the victim Pfc. William T. Santiago (Michael DeLorenzo) had for some time been trying to transfer out of his unit. Also that he had ignored both the Marine Corps code and its chain of command. He had written letters to Washington offering to testify that he had witnessed an incident in which a member of his unit had arbitrarily fired on a Cuban watchtower near the base. As the investigation continues Kaffee and Galloway who clearly never go to the movies read a book or spend much time talking to career service personnel are surprised to discover a kind of military mind that to them seems prehistoric. The two defendants at first behave like automatons. Pfc. Louden Downey (James Marshall) is so taciturn that he seems seriously retarded. His co-defendant and spokesman Lance Cpl. Harold W. Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) refuses all offers of help. He will stoically accept whatever punishment is meted out. The two men simply parrot the Marines code of fidelity to unit corps God and country. On a fact-finding trip to Guantanamo Kaffee Galloway and their assistant Lieut. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) have their first brush with Jessep at a scary lunch during which the colonel cheerfully lies through his teeth. For Galloways benefit he also describes the special kind of high one can get when having sex with a superior officer. According to Jessep thats one of the few benefits of an integrated service. ""A Few Good Men"" doesnt pack the surprises of ""Witness for the Prosecution"" nor does it probe very deeply into the psyche of men who exercise the power of dictators in a society that congratulates itself on its freedoms. Its no ""Full-Metal Jacket."" ""A Few Good Men"" recalls something of ""The Caine Mutiny Court Martial"" though it is most troubling not for the questions it raises but for the casual way it finally treats its two lost utterly bewildered defendants. The screenplay is a good one directed with care and acted for the most part with terrific conviction. Among the supporting players who do exceptional work are Kiefer Sutherland as a Marine officer who is a Jessep in the making; J. T. Walsh as an officer fatally flawed by conscience; Kevin Bacon who appears as the military prosecutor and Mr. Bodison a new young actor whose performance as the more prominent defendant gives the film its melancholy shock value. Mr. Cruise Ms. Moore and Mr. Pollak are perfectly adequate in less flashy roles which unlike the others appear to have been constructed to keep the plot moving right along. They have to play it comparatively straight which must be maddening when the actors around them are having such a colorful time. Mr. Nicholson is in his own league. His Jessep is both a joy to watch because of the actors skill and an explanation of why the United States base at Guantanamo Bay whatever its military value continues to exist. ""A Few Good Men"" is a big commercial entertainment of unusually satisfying order. ""A Few Good Men"" which has been rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) has a lot of vulgar language and some violence.

But this military courtroom drama doesnt follow Hollywood convention. It grabs it by the shirt front and orders it around with bracing spit-and-polish performances from Jack Nicholson Tom Cruise Demi Moore and others.Expanded successfully by Aaron Sorkin from his play ""Men"" is full of loaded manly moments great clashes of will and excellent buzz cuts. Director Rob Reiner has a tremendous ability to elicit great performances. Not only does he give the headliners room to maneuver he enlists able-bodied support from Kevin Bacon Wolfgang Bodison James Marshall and others.At the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay Cuba two young Marines are accused of a reprisal murder. The victim an unpopular Latino soldier had threatened to report one of the alleged killers for illegally firing a gun. The official cause of death is ""lactic acidosis"" a severe reaction of the lungs as the apparent result of a poisoned rag stuffed into his mouth.Convinced of murkier play than this cut-and-dried case implies qualified military attorney Moore volunteers to represent the defense. But the top brass passes her over for bratty Navy lawyer Cruise who has no courtroom experience. To add insult to injury Moore (with Kevin Pollak) is ordered to assist the novice hot dog.While Moore and Cruise spar their investigation encounters daunting resistance from base commander Nicholson and tight-lipped subordinates J. T. Walsh Kiefer Sutherland and prosecutor Bacon. It doesnt help matters that honor-bound defendants Bodison and Marshall demand to be tried rather than take an easy sentence. Cruise Moore and Pollak prepare for an intimidating trial their backs against the wall.The formulaic elements line up one behind the other from ""Top Gun""-style contentiousness between Cruise and Moore to the surprise witness showing up in the nick of time (although theres an interesting twist on that). But ""Men"" is an entertainment to be seen and appreciated in momentum. As such it is constantly gripping the threat of that trial constantly in the air.In the thankless role of Disapproving Woman (and the one who must surrender the romantic flag first) Moore delivers solidly. As Cruises adversary and old friend underrated Bacon takes his supporting role further than tradition allows. Of course theres only one match-up that counts the final encounter between lawyer Cruise and witness Nicholson. As a testosteronal David Cruise has basically replayed this role again and again. He takes charge of his central role admirably. But as the scowling Goliath his lips contorted thinner than the blade of a Marine sword Nicholson crushes all opposition. Hes all controlled fury the living consequence of Americas international show of might. He puts three-dimensional presence into this archetypal role. Suddenly you realize who really should have been saying ""The horror the horror"" in ""Apocalypse Now.""

Walsh; Christopher Guest; Matt Craven; Wolfgang Bodison; Cuba Gooding Jr. profanity Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa ""A Few Good Men"" is a brass-buttoned square-jawed huzzah for military justice thats thankfully free of the messy moralizing of the Vietnam age. An energetic adaptation of the Broadway play this riveting court-martial drama looks at the eternal conflict between a civilization and the barbarity inherent in its defense. Essentially it is ""The Caine Mutiny"" in dry dock with Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise going macho a macho.Nicholson as the fanatical CO at Guantanamo Bay Cuba orders his officers to bring a platoon troublemaker into line through a severe and unsanctioned form of hazing known as a ""Code Red."" When the man dies during the incident two young Marines are charged with his murder and flown to Washington to stand trial. In an attempt to dispense with the affair quickly the Navy assigns a callow buck (Cruise) with a reputation for plea-bargaining to defend the pair. But the Navy hadnt counted on his impassioned co-counsel (Demi Moore) a tough-minded Tripolicious officer who shames Cruise into trying the case though the evidence points to his clients guilt.Behind Cruises Pepsodent smile and cocky exterior hides his fear of failing his late father a Navy lawyer noted for his courtroom elan. The young mans blase attitude antagonizes not only the Guantanamo brass but the gung-ho defendants. He has in fact far more in common with the victim who was likewise notorious for his lack of conviction. ""I cant believe they let you wear a uniform"" observes the lance corporal (impressive non-actor Wolfgang Bodison) who carried out the Code Red with his sidekick (James Marshall).Shorn adherents of the Marine Corps Code -- ""Unit corps God country"" -- Bodison and Marshall are all too ready to martyr themselves for their brethren until they finally understand that they will be excommunicated from the brotherhood if they maintain their silence. A murder rap is nothing compared with a dishonorable discharge and so they admit they were just doing the colonels bidding. Naturally the brass deny this ever happened but bit by bit Moore Cruise and a third co-counsel (Kevin Pollak) get at the truth.With little more to go on than sheer bravado this trio faces an uphill battle against a formidable prosecutor (crisp Kevin Bacon). Never mind that the judge has warned them that they could go down in flames if they call the colonel to the stand and fail to break him in cross-examination. Of course that would also rob Nicholson of the chance to crack up bigtime to prove his ball bearings are just as big as Bogarts Cagneys or Brandos. And boy does he ever.His neck veins popping and Old Spice oozing out of his pores Nicholson gives Cruises top-gun-with-a-briefcase something to test himself against. (Not that you ever really believe Cruise could make Nicholson lose his composure.) But the more entertaining scene takes place in Guantanamo Bay where Nicholson chomping a cigar the size of Florida assails Moore with an ugly speech about the thrills of sex with a woman who outranks you. Moores lieutenant commander doesnt tear up once. Indeed the actress plows through the film steady and dignified as a ships figurehead.While she and Cruise might be expected to fall in love after their scrappy beginning playwright Aaron Sorkin avoids at least this cliche. Sorkin is far more concerned about the abuse of power that occurs when the military is effectively isolated from the democracy it serves. Director Rob Reiner has made much of the heros wrestling match with his famous fathers memory but Reiner actually handles other aspects of the story with more subtlety. Probably because hes got less invested.Still ""A Few Good Men"" is about as understated as a 21-gun salute. Its a grand undertaking that wrangles with the heavy questions that cropped up at Nuremberg and My Lai questions that deserve and get lots of imposing shots of monuments and not a little swashbuckling from the big stars. Whats missing is anything of Reiner himself.""A Few Good Men"" is rated R for profanity.
