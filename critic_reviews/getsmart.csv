Adapted from the popular spoof TV series created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry the movie follows Smart and his leggy sidekick Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) as they hunt down terrorist forces that are attempting to infiltrate the secret government agency CONTROL.With its roots firmly planted in the 60s spy-pastiche genre its perhaps unavoidable that Get Smart has a whiff of Austin Powers about it. But in fact that over-familiarity extends to the whole enterprise from the knockabout violence and slapstick pratfalls to obvious gags about aeroplane toilets and fat women. The overlong script takes no risks its globetrotting plot is replete with signposted twists -  the big last-act reveal will astonish no one over the age of six. Nutty Professor II director Peter Segal consistently substitutes big bangs for big laughs - in the age of low-budget joys such as Knocked Up this kind of overblown effects bonanza is beginning to feel decidedly outdated.Some moments work. Bill Murray makes a welcome if rather perfunctory cameo as an agent trapped inside a tree and the climactic car chase is exciting and remarkably well constructed. But overall this is a limp parade of recycled gags and gadgets an action movie with no surprises and a comedy with nothing like enough laughs.

Its amusing rather than hysterical but its good family fun. As someone who wasnt a fan of the tv show I was pleased to find this movie much better than I expected. If you liked the tv show you will probably like this although the original cast is not in it because its actually funnier. Its one sight gag after anther with a lot of funny throw away lines that may sail over the heads of some because the humor is quite dry. If you dont laugh at some point you need to have your funnybone checked. I especially liked the scene where they think Maxwell Smart is trying to blow up the plane and he ends up with his hands tied in the toilet-what happens as he tries to free himself is amusing. A number of stars have smaller parts -If you like the tv show ""Heroes"" Ichiro is in this. -The Rock is in this. -Bill Murrey is Bill Murrey in this. -James Caan plays President Bush in this but the political humor is fair to both sides.

As a huge Get Smart fan (watched it on Nick at Nite when I was a kid) I thought it was awesome.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/84444/get-smart.html,200,getsmart1,getsmart,timeout

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Angie Get Your Guns Jolie kills Carell smarts Hunter Thompson blasts from the past. _ By David Edelstein Published Jun 23 2008 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Universal Pictures) Along with every other hyperbolic critical adjective state-of-the-art has been devalued by overuse so lets move the boundary posts and proclaim Wanted state-of-the-art state-of-the-art. Assassins propel themselves through space distend time bend bullets like Beckham and live both dangerously and parabolically Yoweeee What a ride on the cyber-whoosh rapids It takes about an hour after its over for the heart to slow the brain to recalibrate and the nonsensicalness of the thing to sink in I fell for that??? By then youll have already babbled to a few dozen friends and strangers You gotta see this movie Its like the bighearted urge to share your Ecstasy at a party. The premise itself isnt world-shattering Wanted is the standard summer-thriller mishmash of blockbusters past from The Matrix (obviously) to The Terminator to Star Wars to Harry Potter with a bit of Bourne for ballast. All feature protagonists who suddenly discover their specialness (Your long-awaited destiny  etc.) along with latent powers they must learn to control (Let your instincts guide you  etc.) a journey that becomes a metaphor for growing up achieving autonomy etc. Skinny Scottish darling James McAvoy puts on an American accent for his first Hollywood FX blockbuster as Wesley Gibson a timid accountant (Im an accountant) who gobbles fistfuls of anti-anxiety pills to counter palpitations (flub-dub flub-dub) and peculiar wobbles in the space-time continuum. Refilling a prescription he finds his jitters are about to increase exponentially There beside him stands Angelina Jolie who utters the pictures equivalent of Come with me if you want to liveonly with a twinkle of amusement as if the whole gazillion-dollar movie were her little toy. BACKSTORY In Wanted Angelina Jolies dexterous assassina member of a brother- (and sister-) hood of killersis tattooed from neck to ankle. Jolies body art is well documented but its not easy to tell which belong to her and which to her character. We added a bunch she admitted to MTV. But based on mine. On the idea that fraternity is based on a sense of justice. As you may know Jolies baby daddy Brad Pitt also got a new much-remarked-upon tat based on a doodle by Angelina. Sweet. The first act of Wanted might be subtitled Waiting for Angelina. Shes neither the hero nor the villain (its a supporting role) but her aura is essential Amid all the artificiality shes a natural wonder with novel permutations of nature-nurture nuttiness. Offscreen we know her as both an occasional home-wrecker and a fervently articulate do-goodera tantalizing mix. Onscreen her aura reshapes every scene. Laugh all you like but shed be a great Hedda Gabler. Can she project vulnerability? Yesshe had a moment believe it or not in the Lara Croft sequel before blowing away her true love. But shell never be a crying-on-the-inside kind of gal. Shes too well defended. In Wanted she plays Fox (just Fox) the distaff member of an ancient fraternity of assassins presided over by Morgan Freeman. She whisks Wesley out of apparent harms way by firing bullets that seem like extensions of her will then steers a car with her long legs while directing a fusillade at the terminator on their taila rogue assassin (Thomas Kretschmann) now picking off old colleagues. When fraternity members train Wesley rather brutally in the art of harnessing his powers Jolie sits back has a little snack and meets the pummeled accountants eyes when the mood strikes her. Could any other actress convey so much while emoting so little? Jolie is a happy distraction from a lot of twaddle (the movie is based on a comic-book series) about mystical coded messages that show up in a giant loom and appear to be hits ordered by Godwho youd think could take out people on His own with the occasional bolt of lightning. But the deft script (by Michael Brandt Derek Haas and Chris Morgan) ends up inverting many of the Matrix tropes it appropriates. (The denouement is a triumph of rug pulling.) And Timur Bekmambetov the Kazakhstan-born director who made the head-trippy vampire opus Night Watch is a killer when it comes to mixing fast and slow motion in ways that screw up your biorhythms You feel as if youre riding on the back of those curving bullets as they hit their targets with a satisfying splat. Wanted has the kind of irresistible summer-movie allure that makes studio executives drool in anticipation. Even its title must swim before their eyes and transform into Want-to-See. Get Smart is likable and very funnyat least a two-to-one ratio of excellent gags to clunkersbut its not for better or worse Get Smart. In spite of the ridiculous malfunctioning secret-agent gadgets the sixties Mel BrooksBuck Henry sitcom wasnt so much a James Bond parody as an American espionage reworking of Peter Sellerss Inspector Clouseau. Agent Maxwell Smart (Don Adams) might have fancied himself 007 but he was a preening boob without a trace of self-awarenesswhich ironically ensured his triumph over his rational (and therefore easily flummoxed) foes. Peter Segals star-packed update is bursting with uproarious gadget shtick but Steve Carells Max simply isnt the idiot we knew and loved. On his own terms Carell is delightful. But hes delightful as a mild-mannered know-it-all whose occasional flights of grandiosity cant keep him from plummeting to Earth. Hes plucky but not impervious. Hes the hero of the deskbound techie nerds at headquarters the geek who gets to move from his analyst job into the field and prove he has the wherewithal to think on his feet. (Theres a genius bit at a urinal.) Its a valid question whether wed want another obtuse Don Adamslike Agent 86. Get Smart the sitcom was a one-joke affair and got tedious fast whereas Carells starry-eyed dweeb has room for nuance for growth for inspiration. A case can be made for both Maxes. Me I miss the thickie. 1 2 Next Share this story...

"Get Smart (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Get Smart (PG-13)  Maxs move to the big screen is definitely smart. In this image released by Warner Bros. Pictures Anne Hathaway left and Steve Carell are shown in a scene from ""Get Smart."" Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle Miami Herald Maybe its the pleasant nostalgic buzz generated by the familiar (and awesome) theme song or the Cold War-reminiscent antics of the modern-day KAOS. Maybe its seeing that old CONTROL shoe phone so technologically obsolete stuck in a museum display and then liberated at the moment of greatest peril. Or maybe its just because the filmmakers waited to tackle the old spy spoof created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry until they signed on Steve Carell the best possible Maxwell Smart this side of Don Adams. But for some reason Get Smart turns out to be a much more entertaining movie than its tedious trailers suggest. Its not going to redefine comedy as we know it but its amusing and briskly paced busy with an engaging mix of supporting actors (Dwayne Johnson Alan Arkin Terence Stamp Masi Oka from Heroes among others). Most crucially Carell (The Office) works out fine as this more appealing Max more an eager bumbler than an inept know-it-all. Usually feature-length versions of sitcoms grow unnecessarily complicated but Get Smart keeps the story fairly straightforward and sticks to the simple comedy that was so appealing all those years ago. Desk jockey Max dreams of being a field agent and finally gets his chance to work with the gorgeous Agent 99 (a glamorous Anne Hathaway stepping in nicely for Barbara Feldon). The agents must work together to foil KAOS plan to set off a rogue nuclear weapon. The entire film is just a set-up for a good mix of basic physical comedy -- it is always funny for example to see a guy staple something to another guys head -- and more subtle jokes such as a one-liner from Arkin that just about brings down the house. Get Smart will probably appeal most to audience members who grew up on the TV show which ran from 1965-70 but their kids will like the slapstick elements as well. Theres nothing really offensive here. The biggest debate about the movie in fact has been how it will fare against the Mike Myers debacle The Love Guru which opens on the same day. While its hard to predict the whims of a fickle audience its safe to say that the smart move is sticking with Max. Cast Steve Carell Anne Hathaway Dwayne Johnson Alan Arkin. Director Peter Segal.

Astle; Release Date Wide 06/20/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 111; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted July 4 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT In Get Smart an homage (would you believe a remake? How about a retrofitting?) of the hit 1960s satiric sitcom about an American spy who bumbled his way through the Cold War with the help of a pre-Steve Jobs shoe phone at his ear Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway play secret agent Maxwell Smart (whos not so) and Agent 99 (whos a dish). The pair work for CONTROL a U.S. spy agency led by a suitably dyspeptic Alan Arkin as The Chief; the bad guys work for KAOS an all-purpose international bad guy clearing house led by a properly villainous Terence Stamp as Siegfried. (Clearly theres no longer a market for easy-to-identify Soviet bad guys.) Youd think the passing of time and the evolved tastes of generations of younger moviegoers not naturally attuned to the Friars Club kibitzing and political satire of Brooks and Henry would make the movie a mission impossible. But youd be wrong. Written by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember and directed by Peter Segal with efficiency cheer and a refreshing lack of look-how-meta-clever-we-are egotism the movie references just enough of the original touchstones and punchlines (the cone of silence the not-ready-for-James-Bond gadgets) to please those who lived it the first time. (Okay those who lived it the first time or at least appreciate Brooksian goons named Shtarker and Noodnik Shpilkes are at an advantage.) Yet those who missed the 60s by that much (or even more) ought to appreciate the movies notably clever action sequences and the fine pseudo-superman self-mockery of Dwayne Johnson as Agent 23. Carell is an expectedly good fit to step into the Smart shoes (with or without secret phone) originally worn by comedian Don Adams. But the unexpected star is Hathaway looking cool as a runway model in the role originated by Barbara Feldon lithe as a (pink) panther and displaying great comic timing.

He never mugs. He doesnt pop his eyes fish-lip his face or go all Jim Carrey Jell-O for the camera. His physical humor consists on the whole of assuming postures of clueless immobility while his castmates flap around him. In moments of profound emotion his eyebrows squinch. A tease of a smile or a frown might play at his mouth. He stares. He blinks for punctuation. Mostly hes just kind of there. But its an endearing and funny place he occupies -- a presence that mixes up innocence with muddled self-absorption and enlivens whatever he does. Consider this chipper energetic and unimaginatively plotted re-do of Get Smart the classic nutball spy parody co-created for television by the great Mel Brooks and rendered in feature length twice before (once for television with the original cast once for the theater with Adams). Fans of The Office who know and love the Carell M.O. may find similarities between Dunder Mifflins knuckleheaded boss and the bumbling Maxwell Smart aka Agent 86 a member of the hush-hush American spy bureau dubbed CONTROL. But Smart is sweeter than Michael less stupid -- and a bit less of a schlimazel than he was back in Adams day when the skinny-tied Cold Warrior with the phone in his shoe chased after wildly inept villains while flirting with Barbara Feldon as the cool-babe Agent 99. When Adams spoke he sounded smirky and nasal and singularly 1960s; Carell would have been an idiot to imitate him instead using his own deadpan tenor and dry-bones timing to poke the humor out of dialogue. There are other differences between old-model Smart and new-model Smart including such personal revelations as Maxs love of ABBA and his preference for briefs over boxers. If memory serves the original 86 not once complained about going ""freebird"" under his trousers.. But this is a reboot and reboots inspire such adjustments. Or is this an homage? Theres the rub How to pay obeisance to a beloved old series while kicking it up to the 21st century. For the most part Get Smart -- directed by The Longest Yards Peter Segal from a script by Failure to Launchs Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember -- solves this dilemma with an origin story that follows Max from his early days as a deskbound analyst under the Chief (Alan Arkin a snug fit) to his first assignment as a field agent with Agent 99. In that role we find Anne Hathaway whose younger incarnation still projects an aura of Feldon-era femininity. As for Max what a sensitive fellow. He suffers from low self-esteem and insists that villains are people too. But he hasnt yet met Siegfried (a Teutonic nincompoop on the original show now upgraded to a very smooth very frightening Terence Stamp) whos offing CONTROL agents and planning to whack a major American target with stolen nuclear materiel. On the case are 86 99 -- and a new guy 23 a macho freak with a stapling problem played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Everyone carries cell phones these days though the shoe makes a cameo. So do Bill Murray and the original Siegfried Bernie Kopell who toodles in to underscore the gap between his Get Smart and this one. What once was pure spoofy goofiness is now a little less so -- this is a sharper package action-packed trigger-happy and vulgar -- but how could it be otherwise? The original series ran from 1965 to 1970 on NBC and CBS a high-camp product of its time both the hardware and the paranoia were absurd. Segals film can reference the gimmickry (the ""Cone of Silence"" or Hymie the android) but the re-jiggered political landscape doesnt abide fools for long.

Its not only fresh and unassuming but a film that serves very nicely the severely underserved audience of young girls. ENLARGE Abigail Breslin who won an Oscar nomination for her performance in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" plays the title role a 10-year-old who bless her heart and her Royal portable typewriter is determined to become a newspaper reporter. The story is set in Cincinnati in 1934 during the Depression when electronic journalism wasnt much of an option; no one but the radio commentator H.V. Kaltenborn wanted to be H.V. Kaltenborn. Kits father played by Chris ODonnell is a car dealer and her mother (Julia Ormond) is a lady of some leisure serving lunch in the backyard for members of her garden club most of whom wear floral prints. All of that changes though when Dads dealership goes bust and he leaves town in search of a job and Mom turns the family home into a boarding house for a collection of picturesque -- insistently picturesque -- characters. They include Joan Cusacks Miss Bond a mobile librarian who keeps bumping into things with her library truck and Stanley Tuccis Jefferson J. Berk a self-enchanted magician who levitates Miss Bond. This is the first theatrical feature film based on the American Girl line of dolls and the American Girl books. (Patricia Rozema directed Ann Peacock adapted Valerie Tripps book and David Boyd did the lovely cinematography.) As a piece of Americana its more Norman Rockwell than Dorothea Lange. The Depression has been cleansed of its most depressing aspects. Even a hobo jungle looks like a place where honesty and kindness trump bad luck. As a piece of filmmaking its less levitated than planted on uneven ground. For all its imperfections though ""Kit Kittredge"" looks awfully good when measured against the cynical slops being shoveled to mass audiences this summer. The film does deal with poverty in its earnest fashion and Kit is a worthy proto-feminist role model. She becomes a detective when justice requires it -- hobos have been blamed unfairly for a crime wave -- and breaks into public print despite the deep doubts of Wallace Shawns charmingly crusty Mr. Gibson an editor who makes his free-lancers earn their penny per word. All of this works as pleasantly as it does because the star carries the event-stuffed story with unflagging grace. Two years ago as Olive in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" Abigail Breslin was chubby wide-eyed and endearing. Earlier this year a tawdry studio comedy called ""Definitely Maybe"" turned her into a lip-glossed pre-teen who learns about her fathers romantic entanglements. In ""Kit Kittredge"" shes neither chubby nor sexualized but a comely young actress playing a smart pretty girl. Whats unchanged from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is her sweet radiance. She seems delighted by life. ENLARGE A scene from My Winnipeg IFC Films My Winnipeg Until now Guy Maddins films have been an acquired taste I couldnt manage to acquire. Theyre surreal eccentric poetic and graphically striking in their intentionally crude soft-focus evocation of the silent era and the agitprop form. But ""My Winnipeg"" breaks through to something else. This autobiographical meditation is seductively funny as well as deliciously strange and hauntingly beautiful as well as stream-of-consciousness cockeyed. And the film succeeds partly thanks to rather than in spite of its swirling mostly black-and-white images that might have been downloaded from a fevered dream. Winnipeg is where Mr. Maddin has lived his whole life. In the films dream logic its the city and the life he must explore before being able to escape. ""What if I film my way out of here?"" he asks in a faux-naif voice-over. ""Its time for extreme measures."" To that end he uses actors to re-enact scenes from his childhood -- the acting is implacably bad but mysteriously affecting -- and home movies and snapshots that may or may not be authentic. The filmmaker dwells obsessively almost deliriously on Winnipegs twin distinctions the snow and the cold. (Snow falls on the actor playing him even when hes nodding off in a seat on a train.) His narration is as witty in its mock-epic way as the late-night free-form radio broadcasts that Jean Shepherd used to do many decades ago at KYW in Philadelphia. Yet the incantatory words play second fiddle to the moving pictures -- of Winnipegs vast fogbound train yards moldering arena and silhouetted sleepwalkers who carry the keys to all their old addresses as they like Guy Maddin search the city for fugitive memories. ""My Winnipeg"" is not your standard multiplex flick -- a childhood Chihuahua is played by a pug for Petes sake -- but given the prevailing standard thats all to the good. ENLARGE Steve Carell in Get Smart Warner Bros. Pictures Get Smart Rather than the laugh a minute promised by old comedies ""Get Smart"" generates approximately one laugh per hour and I cant remember either one. True to the TV series that spawned it the production looks cheerfully tacky but all other traces of cheer let alone sophistication have been expunged. Steve Carell in the role created by Don Adams is the bumbling agent Maxwell Smart and Anne Hathaway is in for Barbara Feldon as Agent 99. Never mind that hes 20 years her senior an age difference that extinguishes hints of romance. Her performance is shrill and he looks rueful when he isnt downright glum. (See a clip from the film.) ENLARGE Mike Myers in The Love Guru Paramount Pictures The Love Guru Compared to ""The Love Guru"" ""Get Smart"" is ""Citizen Kane."" Mike Myers as a blissed-out self-help charlatan named Guru Pitka gets to ride a bejeweled elephant and an electric carpet and talk with a funny Indian accent. But his character and a ramshackle plot about a lovelorn hockey star (played by Romany Malco) are only crude pretexts for crotch humor toilet humor sexual outuendo and a merciless succession of scenes involving flatulence urination and a dislikable dwarf. This from Paramount the studio of Cecil B. DeMille W.C. Fields ""Sunset Boulevard"" ""Rear Window"" ""Psycho"" and the road pictures of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. The road taken by ""The Love Guru"" could hardly be lower and leads nowhere. ENLARGE Photofest DVD Tip This isnt a pick but a plea to Universal Studios. Please oh please release ""King of the Hill"" on DVD. Not the TV series which is widely available but the 1993 film directed by Steven Soderbergh with Jesse Bradford as a resourceful boy left to his resources in Depression-era St. Louis. Its one of the best coming-of-age films ever made.

But he can never be permitted to act effectively against that world. At the end of his adventures he must somehow triumph over the forces of darkness that surround him -- but only accidentally so. Thats why we identify with him; if he is one of us we know perfectly well that we wouldnt last a minute against all those men in black wielding highly advanced weaponry. In that spirit of genial fantasy we permit out surrogate that utter self-confidence that sublime sangfroid with which with he cheerfully motors his way around and through disaster. Hes what we would be -- in our dreams -- if we had any luck. There was a lot of this peculiar energy in the characters portrayed by the great silent comedians. And there was a lot of it in Maxwell Smart the doofus inanely self-confident secret agent Don Adams played in Get Smart the iconic 1960s television series in which Mel Brooks and Buck Henry started satirizing James Bond almost before he made his first smirking wisecrack to Miss Moneypenny. One dared wanly to hope that the loose slightly impoverished air of that funny curiously memorable little enterprise might somehow prevail in our era of more grandiose imagery. To be honest that hope began to darken as I thumbed through the production notes prior to a screening of Get Smart. Many persons involved with the movie prattled on about their swell new action sequences ""worthy of any thriller"" with their up-to-date ""scale and scope."" Scale? Scope? Are they kidding? Heres the deal guys action sequences are not funny. They never have been and they never will be. For they require that their protagonist set aside his bumbling physical incompetence and start acting decisively and heroically. At which point our connection with him is broken and he becomes just another guy who might as well be named Edward Norton. Or Bruce Willis. That Max Smart is played by the admirable Steve Carell who is desperately looking for deadpan jokes in all the wrong places is beside the point. So too is that his sidekick is played by the lissome Anne Hathaway who also seems willing to go along with a gag if only she could find one. Or that their nerdy colleagues in CONTROL have a few attenuated comical moments in their fight to save the free world from KAOS. They are all strapped to a hurtling plot line that is heading from one fireball to the next with only a few not-so-hot Bush-Cheney jokes to divert them. And us. ""Forget it Jake its summertime"" a cynical voice whispers in my ear and I know hes right. You cannot expect a bunch of vacationing kids to remember let alone revere a cheeky little TV half hour that entertained the old folks almost a half century ago. For all I know it was not as funny as we thought it was back in those less megalomaniac times. But Charlie Chaplin used to say that all he needed to make a comedy was a park a policeman a pretty girl and his divinely innocent self. Of course he was touched by genius and the people who make movies like Get Smart are touched by no more than the unwise desire to spend someone elses money on special effects that are inherently antithetical to the antic. The phrase someone ought to be whispering in their ears is ""Less is more."" Its a concept that might have been catnip to a superb minimalist like Steve Carell.

Directed by Peter Segal. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Remaking ""Get Smart"" for the big screen might have sounded like a bad idea but the movie shows it to have been something else a really bad idea. The height of hip in 1965 the TV sitcom had already outlived its welcome and its moment by 1970 with its odd mix of absurdist humor catchphrases and straight-up violence. Delicately poised between two eras - balancing Cold War values with irreverent new-style comedy - ""Get Smart"" was the product of a specific time and place. Under the best of circumstances transferring 1965s winning formula to 2008 was going to be difficult. Yet it could have been done if someone had a reason for doing it. That is a good reason. That is a reason that had something to do with inspiration. But the inspiration for this movie version doesnt seem to have gone any deeper than this Steve Carell is a funny guy whose hair is similar to that of Don Adams the original Maxwell Smart. As it stands ""Get Smart"" the movie is an action comedy that represents the worst of both worlds. Like a bad action movie its bloated confused and convoluted relying too much on extended action sequences that are heavy on computer effects. And like the worst comedies ""Get Smart"" is about as funny as a gently smiling mime. It couldnt buy a laugh in a nitrous oxide factory with a fistful of clown noses. The first mistake was to make it at all. The second mistake was to set the movie in 2008. Maxwell Smart works as an analyst for KONTROLL a covert agency that supposedly ceased to exist with the fall of communism. In his current incarnation Max isnt an idiot. Hes methodical and oblivious an egghead who speaks several languages and writes 500-page reports that no one bothers to read. The screenplay by Tom J. Astle and Mark Ember is a succession of easy reaches and cliches. Whats the threat to the United States that Maxwell Smart wants to avert? A suitcase nuke in a major city of course. Hows that for a comic premise? Funny right? And of course when Max first meets Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) he flirts and shes snotty and then theyre thrown together on an assignment and shes skeptical and ... Anyway. You could come up with a story like this just by daydreaming for 30 seconds. No one challenged himself in the making of this movie. Seen today the show ""Get Smart"" has a disconcerting way of mixing violence and silliness a combination that wouldnt play for modern audiences. And so the makers of the new ""Get Smart"" skew the movie in the direction of action. Yet they cant make things too somber without defeating what little comedy there is. The result is neither fish nor fowl an action movie in which the action seems an intrusion and in which the consequences of the action cant be taken seriously. In other words its a mess. Carell is the movies sole important asset. Hathaway is fine. This is just a speed bump on her road to glory. And theres nothing unpleasant about seeing Alan Arkin as the chief or Terence Stamp as the evil maniac Siegfried. (Stamps performance actually could be lifted out and put in a serious drama and no one would notice anything odd about it.) James Caan shows up as the president in the most pointed nasty parody of George W. Bush to date (the kind of thing that happens only in a presidents last year in office). But Carell is the only positive influence on the audiences experience of the movie. Carell is a top comedian but unlike most comedians in his league he has a benevolent aura. That goes a long way. If you hate the movie its still impossible to hate him and liking him from scene to scene despite the emptiness and stupidity of his surroundings elevates ""Get Smart"" from galling to merely lousy. But what a way for Carell to use his gifts. -- Advisory This film contains action violence and remorseless killing.

(PG-13) Warner Bros. (111 min.) Directed by Peter Segal. With Steve Carell Anne Hathaway. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS The new big-screen version of ""Get Smart"" features a thousand uproarious moments and a hundred breathtaking action sequences. Er would you believe a hundred amusing jokes and a dozen roller-coaster climaxes? Um would you believe two slapstick kicks to the crotch and a really big car chase? Sorry about that but for anyone old enough to remember the original TV spy satire those catch phrases -- ""Missed it by that much"" ""Oh Max .$?.$?."" -- linger. Even if we stopped laughing at them after the first season -- and I know I did -- theyre as indelible as ad jingles. What is surprising is how quickly the movie ""Get Smart"" manages to get past them. It has the old lines and the funky props (the phone-booth trapdoor the ""cone of silence"" the shoe) that fans remember. But it also has some decent new ideas too. And thanks to Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway a bit of a new vibe. It needed it. Mel Brooks and Buck Henrys original ""Get Smart"" was born during the big Bond boom -- but its 60s werent just sexy but sexist. Although Barbara Feldons Agent 99 was a better spy than the blundering Maxwell Smart because she was a woman she had to bail him out quietly keeping his fragile ego intact. That dynamic would feel as retro today as Feldons shiny vinyl clothes so the new script by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember has updated it. In their version Smart is clumsy but self-aware; Agent 99 comes to his rescue but with a sharp word or two. Hes no longer a complete clown; shes no longer his selfless nanny. For the first time theyre equals -- like ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" but without the kinks. Its nice to see Steve Carell in a decent movie again after ho-hum programmers like ""Dan in Real Life"" or the awful ""Evan Almighty."" (Nice too to see Arkin in a cranky comic role as Maxs boss the Chief -- did he and Carell plan this one out in between takes of ""Little Miss Sunshine""?) Whether or not Carell tweaked the script (the writers last project ""Failure to Launch"" was more like ""Failure to Laugh"") he makes Max more human. Hathaway has less to work with as Agent 99 -- its a fairly standard movie-heroine part -- but she looks good in action and wears her Chanel well. (Although the script misses the chance for a running gag Just where does she keep getting all these clothes while she and Max are on the run from the villainous KAOS?) ""The supporting cast also includes a few fun guest stars (not counting the dour Terence Stamp whose villainous turn is strictly shoephoned-in.) Unfortunately the plotting isnt quite as inventive as the rewrites of the main characters. The story features a henchman out of an old 007 movie a ""Dr. Strangelove"" fight in the war room and dated topical jokes; some Bush gags feel particularly past their expiration date. And while director Peter Segal gives his actors room (hes one of Adam Sandlers most compliant collaborators) he gets lazy too -- flashbacks we dont need an ending that drags. Actually if youre really in the mood for a so-dumb-its-smart comedy youre in luck; today also brings the New Jersey opening of ""OSS 117 Cairo -- Nest of Spies"" a sublimely silly French farce that spoofs both 60s secret-agent movies and the cultural assumptions that made them possible. But if youre resistant to subtitles -- or just in the mood for the familiar -- ""Get Smart"" is everywhere. And guaranteed to keep you laughing. Would you believe keep you smiling? Would you believe keep you mildly entertained? Sorry about that. Rating note The film contains crude jokes and violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

""Get Smart"" avoids the fate of such duds as ""I Spy"" ""The Mod Squad"" ""The Avengers"" and ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" through its genius casting of Carell. He pays homage to the deadpan delivery and catchphrases of the late Don Adams (""Sorry about that Chief"") but puts a distinctively different spin on the concept of Maxwell Smart as a nitwit blowhard secret agent didnt transfer well to the big screen when Adams tried it with the aptly named ""The Nude Bomb"" in 1980. Carells talents are much better served by the new Max a quietly brainy analyst who gets a chance to realize his long-held dream of working in the field. He becomes Agent 86 after disaster strikes CONTROL the CIA-like agency where he works. Agent 99 played on the series by the immortal Barbara Feldon as a far more competent agent who not so secretly adored Max has also been rethought for the post-Cold War era. In the quite capable comic hands of Anne Hathaway shes an experienced agent whos annoyed at being teamed with a newbie whose physical skills leave a lot to be desired. But the formulaic plot - theyre assigned to prevent KAOS from nuking Los Angeles - of course throws them together and sometimes on top of each other at every turn. In fact the plot is not dissimilar from that of ""I Spy"" but the difference is that director Peter Segal actually wrings some laughs out of the situations. The big comic set piece is totally tangential but pure genius. Its a dance competition in Russia that pits Agent 99 and a KAOS functionary (Davis S. Lee) against (the formerly fat) Max and a hefty woman (Lindsay Hollister) he pulls out of the crowd. Other comedic moments - including poor Maxs flailing attempts at using a customized knife (he keeps harpooning himself) and trying to somersault through a room booby-trapped with lasers - make up for overblown stunt sequences. Carell and Hathaway receive splendid support from old pro Alan Arkin as CONTROLs exasperated Chief and Dwayne Johnson is slyly funny as the swaggering Agent 23 whom Max has long idolized. To further appeal to youngsters unfamiliar with the series there are Masi Oka and Nate Torrence as CONTROLs resident tech geeks. For us aging boomers theres Terence Stamp as the head of KAOS (spouting insults to his aide played by Ken Davitian of ""Borat"") a hilarious cameo by Bill Murray - and James Caan as the oblivious president of the United States reading ""Good Night Moon"" to first-graders a la Dubya on 9/11. Theres also a more elaborate version of the series famous sight gag opening - the endless series of steel doors leading to a telephone booth with an elevator. Maxs even more fabled shoe phone also makes an appearance - and fortunately for ""Get Smart"" the self-deprecating Carell isnt shoe-phoning in his inspired performance. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next WILLIAMS IN FOR RUSSERT Read Next WILLIAMS IN FOR RUSSERT Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 16323 How Hillary blew her big moment 9617 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 6874 NYC tourist duped into buying 1M worth of fake jewelry Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

In other words he had everything he needed to make a great summer movie. And he missed it by that much.Its no easy task following Buck Henry and Mel Brooks the series original writers. And the notion of an inept spy fighting Cold War baddies is obviously outdated. But plenty of movies from 2004s ""Team America"" to this seasons ""Iron Man"" have affirmed that theres more than enough inspiration to be found in our edgy era. So why would Segal and screenwriters Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember raid the vaults just to make the kind of generic action comedy weve seen a thousand times?Steve Carell should be the perfect choice to step into Don Adams phone-shoes though his Maxwell Smart is a totally different breed. Hes a mild-mannered analytical genius in fact who just happens to be an occasional airhead. Max is desperate to work in the field and when his agency CONTROL is attacked by longtime enemy KAOS the Chief (Alan Arkin) finally sends him off to Russia. The villainous Siegfried (Terence Stamp) is producing nuclear weaponry and only Smart can save us all. Since this is Maxs first assignment --and hes a bit of a bumbler -- hes paired with ultra-competent Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway). Shes unimpressed with his inexperience and hes offended by her icy professionalism. But if they cant work together chaos will reign.While the whole cast -- including Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson -- is game too much time was spent coordinating chase scenes and explosions and too little fixing a slack script that relies on bathroom humor and snickering sex jokes. And would you believe Segal barely allows his fearlessly comic lead to cut loose? Although Carell is never less than likable hes funnier in any random scene of ""The Office."" Heres hoping some misguided team doesnt try to turn that series into a quick grab at box-office bucks 40 years from now.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Great news for Steve Carells Maxwell Smart an ace intelligence analyst who has desperately wanted to be in the field. Not so fine for veteran Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) whos partnered with the seeming bumbler in the spry update of ""Get Smart"" the late 60s spy-vs.-spy TV series created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. Theres an always-appealing decency to Carells performances. He conveys humility in a smirk hints at an alertness beneath a characters foolishness or insecurity. His brand of handsome makes sense. It belongs to the realm of possibility (the good but also the off days ) not merely to the pages of ""Vanity Fair."" These qualities are on full display in a particularly winning scene. At a swank party in Russia Agent 99 dances with a suave baddie. Smart chooses a larger-than-zaftig partner for what becomes a dance-off between the couples. The movie could have settled for a tiresome fat joke. Instead star and director Peter Segal create an occasion to laugh but also to revel in a triumph. Earlier Max confessed to Agent 99 hed been dramatically overweight. While ""Get Smart"" isnt perfect comedy it is a pleasing cut above two recent flicks starring comics who too often insist on being the center of their storytelling universes Adam Sandler and Mike Myers. Carell plays well with others. The others here include his cohort at the clandestine arts agency. Many believe CONTROL went defunct as did KAOS after the Cold War. Instead its housed deep beneath a museum exhibit of its glory days and once groovy gadgets. Dwayne Johnson is Agent 23 the golden boy of the organization and mentor to Max. Alan Arkin brings his peculiar zing to The Chief. As engineering duo Bruce and Lloyd Masi Oka and Nate Torrence provide an affably geeky counterpoint to the agency bullies Agent 91 (Terry Crews) and Larabee (David Koechner). Playing for team KAOS is Terence Stamp as the insulting lethal Siegfried and Ken Davitian the hirsute foil in ""Borat"" as his sidekick Shtarker. Hathaways Agent 99 wears Prada (actually its Chanel) and can kick hiney in heels. If youre wondering why a top agent in the ranks of CONTROL isnt recognizable theres an answer that comes with some complications of its own plastic surgery. Hathaway proves her own mettle when she delivers a moment that upends the pace of the action-comedy for the better. Finding emotional traction in a summertime romp always makes it better. Shes done Barbara Feldon proud. Theres always been a teasing confusion to the title. ""Get Smart."" Does it mean ""nab that agent"" Or ""Learn""? Carell does a nimble job of keeping that tension alive. One minute hes making himself into a human pincushion with a miniature crowbar. Ouch. But then hell use his smarts to bond with a hulking sulking adversary. The plot feels provisional like the movie is feeling its way toward a better sequel. And writers Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember arent always in control of the brew of comedy and contemporary anxieties about ""yellow cake uranium"" and nuclear terrorism. Still by movies end we can imagine spending some more time with Agents 86 and 99 and liking it.

By Peter Rainer June 21 2008 Save for later Saved ""Get Smart"" needed to be a lot smarter. And funnier. The movie stands as proof yet again that hit television series do not make for good movies. Everything from ""Bewitched"" to ""The Avengers"" proves the point. Even ""Sex and the City"" despite its box-office grosses is no great shakes. Its a phenomenon passing itself off as a movie.Hopes ran high for ""Get Smart"" because Steve Carell seems like perfect casting in the Don Adams role as bumbling CONTROL secret agent Maxwell Smart. And Carell isnt bad exactly. Without aping Adamss delivery and mannerisms he manages to create a character who both evokes the original and yet seems new. His Maxwell is more sympathetic than his predecessor - we are not encouraged to view him as an object of derision.But because Maxwell is now a more conventional if still klutzy spy he also has less of a comic edge. And his partner in espionage Anne Hathaways Agent 99 is not the ego-boosting helpmate that Barbara Feldon was in the original show. Shes an abrasive vamp with a passing resemblance to Catherine Zeta-Jones in the Sean Connery movie ""Entrapment."" (""Get Smart"" even duplicates a slinky sequence from that film involving Zeta-Jones and a high-energy laser beam). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gone is the dry wit that made the 60s show created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry such a cult favorite. The catchphrases are all here ""Would you believe?"" and all the rest of them. But theyre just meaningless prattle since most audiences for this film have never seen the TV show. Director Peter Segal and his writers made the tactical decision to load ""Get Smart"" with so many standard-issue action sequences that to the untutored eye its almost indistinguishable from the muck of nonsatirical fare out there. If your aim is to create a wingding of a comedy hedging your bets is never a good idea. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Get Smart The nefarious espionage agency KAOS headed up by Terence Stamps Siegfried is still giving CONTROL a hard time. But theres a cold-war pall hanging over this film which is partly set in Moscow that makes it seem not just antiquated but irrelevant. Im not saying that Al Qaeda should have kidnapped Maxwell and spirited him to Afghanistan. Its just that the original ""Get Smart"" was a humorous response to the terror of the times in a way that the current movie never even attempts. Instead we get the same old gags like the scene where a fistfight breaks out in the Pentagons war room. (""Dr. Strangelove"" anybody?)At least we have Alan Arkin playing the head of CONTROL. His drone and deadpan are a perfect complement to Carells. But please pretty please lets not go for a sequel on this one OK? Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for some rude humor action violence and language.)

"Get Smart Clever comedy thriller | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsGet Smart Clever comedy thriller Advance intel for Get Smart had it that the spy spoof didnt just miss it by that much  but by a country mile.Anne Hathaway and Steve Carell star in Get Smart based on the 1960s spy spoof sitcom.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 20 2008 Get Smart (out of 4)Starring Steve Carell Anne Hathaway Alan Arkin Dwayne Johnson and Terence Stamp. Directed by Peter Segal.110 minutes. At major theatres. PG Advance intel for Get Smart had it that the spy spoof didnt just miss it by that much but by a country mile.All year weve heard subterranean rumblings of rewrites and reshoots and of a lack of chemistry between leads Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway. Even the tag line seemed lame ""Saving the World. And Loving It.""Well the same peddlers of this bad buzz also probably had something do with those bogus ""weapons of mass destruction"" warnings out of Iraq. The truth is that Get Smart is one of the years sharper comedies and if it contains any WMDs that stands for ""wit of major delight.""The skepticism was understandable given Hollywoods generally dismal track record of converting TV series into feature films. Especially a show like Get Smart a James Bond parody that is as much a part of 1960s camp lore as Batman or Barbarella. Who exactly was a Get Smart movie made for aging 60s hipsters now in their 60s or their easily bored grandkids?None of this skulduggery matters it turns out because the film stands on its own merits and appeals to all ages as a clever comedy thriller. In assuming the key role of Maxwell Smart the bumbling Agent 86 of U.S. spy agency CONTROL Carell provides due homage to series original Don Adams while adding his own comic flourishes.Anne Hathaway does the same with Agent 99 Barbara Feldons flirting femme keeping the romantic intrigue while upping the action.Supporting stars fit the duo as snugly as a shoe phone Alan Arkin as the beleaguered CONTROL Chief; Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson as beefy and bossy Agent 23 and Terence Stamp as amusingly diabolical bad guy Siegfried.There are so many ways this movie could have gone wrong its a relief to see that director Peter Segal (50 First Dates Anger Management) and writers Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember (the scribes of Failure to Launch) didnt stray too far from the template laid down more than 40 years ago by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. But they also avoid the trap of slavish devotion and they thankfully dont overdo the famous catchphrases ""Missed it by that much"" and ""Sorry about that Chief""Maxwell Smart is still as blind to his flaws as ever unable to see that his own blunders make him a dartboard for trouble of all kinds. Hes been upgraded from bumbling idiot to bumbling savant since Carells Max actually has a brain and can make like 007 when the occasion demands.Agent 99 is tougher but also more vulnerable than Feldons pussycat. Hathaways creation is more like Diana Riggs Mrs. Peel from the old The Avengers TV series (too bad about that movie) but she hides a heart that has been wounded in love.The story is every bit as Cold War loopy as the Get Smart of old with the gadget-obsessed Americans of CONTROL battling the troublesome nudniks of Eastern bloc KAOS over a conspiracy to blow up the planet or the U.S. president whichever comes first. Max first appears as a policy wonk as dull as the 1000-page briefing books he pens but he is soon upgraded to secret agent after a mole blows the cover of most other CONTROL agents.He is teamed with a reluctant Agent 99 whose recent plastic surgery (turning her from blond to brunette bombshell) allowed her to retain her secret identity. The action sequences are better than the pro forma ones youd expect in a spy spoof. A three-way airborne tussle involving three people and one parachute is both amusing and heart-stopping and a struggle aboard a burning SUV speeding toward a train is better than anything in the new Indiana Jones movie - and funnier too.Get Smart even manages to knock a few blockheads in the political realm with a few well-placed zingers aimed at government and CIA ineptitude and at Hollywoods limousine liberals. The only miss in this regard is the casting of tough guy James Caan as a George W. Bush clone which is both a bad match and a pointless parody. Bush jokes are just so 15 minutes ago.Watch for fun cameos including one where a well-known comic hides in a tree as a lonely Agent 13. Nostalgia nuts will cheer the news that the Cone of Silence and shoe phone are still as unreliable as they were in the 1960s even though the cone is now an advanced hologram and the phone has digital push buttons.

Thats the term that best describes ""Get Smart."" It revives the old TV franchise with the same slapstick derring-do and lightweight comedy that tickled audiences in the waning days of the Cold War. Its less a reboot or a reimagining than a rerun. On balance its not great not bad. If you smile at the memory of Maxwell Smarts ""would you believe"" shtick or the Cone of Silence theres a lot in the film that will please you. Should you expect a fresh imaginative take on spy comedy however the movie will be about as appealing as a reheated TV dinner. Steve Carell steps easily into Don Adams shoe-phone as Smart. Hes a master at layering stiff deadpan dignity on top of ineptitude which is the perfect mix of attributes for the would-be superspy. As the film opens Smart is an analyst for CONTROL a secret government agency still engaged in its decades-long struggle against the nefarious forces of KAOS. Hes a master at detecting important information in mountains of intercepted chatter. He even knows what it means if a KAOS agent orders a muffin with his coffee yearning for comfort food indicates stress. But (as in real-life Washington D.C.) no one reads intelligence reports. Naturally Max longs to be a swashbuckling field agent. When the identities of CONTROLs operatives are exposed the inexperienced Max is named Agent 86 and paired with veteran Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway). She is not at risk because she recently had plastic surgery to change her appearance. She confesses that she also asked for a more youthful look (the better to make Hathaway a suitable romantic foil for Carell who is 20 years her senior). The pair set out for Russia looking for yellowcake uranium in -- where else? -- a Moscow bakery. GET SMART  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for some rude humor action violence and language. The film is scripted and directed by Hollywood mid-listers who do a passable job. Screenwriters Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember (of the limp Matthew McConaughey romcom ""Failure to Launch"") keep the story moving along smartly but dont approach the surreal flights of imagination that sometimes graced the TV series (which was created by comedy legends Mel Brooks and Buck Henry after all). Director Peter Segal apparently decided that fat people are automatically funny when he made ""Nutty Professor II The Klumps."" He repeats the lesson here with flashbacks to a grossly overweight Max and a ballroom dance sequence that recalls the ballerina hippo from ""Fantasia."" The supporting players keep the films comic energy elevated. Dwayne Johnson brings a larger-than-life swagger to the role of heroic Agent 23. Alan Arkin is warm yet irascible as the Chief James Caan contributes a brief entertaining turn as the President and Bill Murray tosses off a goofy underplayed cameo as ever-camouflaged Agent 13. With comic resources like this ""Get Smart"" should have been a hoot not just satisfactory. Missed it by that much.

You could apply the same observation to this facile big-screen remake starring Steve Carell ""Missed it by that much."" The movie cannibalizes the basic framework of the old TV spy spoof the premise the main characters the catchphrases and many of the sight gags including the series of slamming steel gates Max has to pass through to enter C.O.N.T.R.O.L. headquarters. All thats missing is the spirit and the anarchic humor of the sitcom created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. The result is an overdressed carefully stitched scarecrow of a comedy. In the new Get Smart Max is a brilliant if fussy government analyst interpreting chatter - bits of enemy conversation picked up by satellites and other espionage hardware. When the evil K.A.O.S. led by the unlikely tandem of Terence Stamp and Borat pal Ken Davitian infiltrates Maxs organization dashing spies like Dwayne Johnsons cocky Agent 23 are assigned to desk duty and the pencil-pushing Max is pushed out into the field. For his first international assignment he is teamed with the lanky and lethal Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway). Their mission is a tedious exercise in cloak-and-stagger with lots of physical gags double entendres and humiliation humor (like Max ballroom-dancing with an enormous woman). Its a series of slapstick sketches slammed together without the cohesion of narrative. As a diversionary tactic the movie supersizes the supporting castranging from Alan Arkin (assuming Edward Platts old role as Chief) to Heroes Masi Oka David Koechner Dalip Singh (better known as professional wrestler the Great Khali) as a Jaws-like adversary and James Caan who is dreadful as the dim-witted president with the Texas twang. But Get Smart is just warming up. It mixes in cameos in manic and madcap fashion a wild cavalcade including Bill Murray Kevin Nealon Patrick Warburton and Bernie Kopell the Love Boat doctor who was the original K.A.O.S. boss on TV. Theres even a vocal drop-in from Ryan Seacrest who also gets name-checked in the script with suspicious frequency. But all these faces popping out of the woodwork - or in Murrays case out of the wood - dont do much to disguise the emptiness at the heart of Get Smart. Carell gives a bewilderingly bland performance. Maybe he just couldnt get a handle on his character who is a hopeless klutz in one scene and an acrobatic superman in the next. Hathaway lends this clunky caper a touch of class. But even that proves to be a sour note because it reminds you of what an enjoyable film this could have been if only all hands had fully committed to it instead of going through the motions. Director Peter Segal (Tommy Boy) wields a brisk pace that puts the best possible face on this material. But hes overwhelmed by a tacked-on and interminable final act in which a disgraced Max must redeem himself and avert a cataclysm. The action scenes and there are many of them are incredibly feeble. Still the old theme song written by Irving Szathmary the older brother of comedian Bill Dana also known as Jose Jimenez still sounds good. So at least Get Smart has that going for it.

After seeing it the question remains. Why Get Smart? Why now? The show in which Don Adams starred as Maxwell Smart a dim-bulb secret agent who was a sort of poor-and-stupid-mans James Bond was funny enough. And it boasted a nice pedigree as it was created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry. But the shows run - 1965-70 - was so long ago that comparisons are practically moot. As it stands the film version is basically a testament to Steve Carells likability as a born loser who somehow falls upward in life a role he has perfected in such films as The 40-Year-Old Virgin and on the TV show The Office (though he doesnt fall up very far there). Hes dependably funny here - sweetly charming comes to mind as a description - and the movie has some laughs. But overall the general feeling is Missed it by this much. Ouch. Sorry that was so obvious it couldnt be helped. On the other hand its possible the audience for this film was born so long after the show ended that such a line Maxs signature will be lost both here and in the film - as will Agent 13 (Bill Murray or at least his face in a cameo) hiding in a tree or Hymie (Patrick Warburton) showing up radio-controlled and whatnot. Shoe phone ring any bells? Cone of silence anyone? Carell plays Max less as a bumbling spy and more as a pathetic wannabe agent; as the film begins in a rather odd take on the character hes a researcher hoping for bigger things. He was in fact once a bigger thing himself. Max has lost 150 pounds a point made time and again in the film. But now hes in shape has passed his field-agent exam and is ready for action. But to the Chief (Alan Arkin) Max is too valuable as an analyst to risk running around with people shooting at him. Naturally events conspire to change that and soon Max - now Agent 86 - and Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) are in Russia working a rather dubious case involving nuclear weapons and a threat against Los Angeles or some such. The enemy is again KAOS. Like that particular brand of bad guys Max and his CONTROL cohort are thought to be extinct so much so that Max passes a museum display commemorating the Cold War showdown on his way to work. Obviously this is not the case. Although the story is predictable and stale a mishmash of just about every spy movie of the past 30 years the supporting cast is good; Dwayne Johnson who plays Agent 23 is carving out a nice little niche for himself by poking fun at his tough-guy persona employing a knowing wink and nod. Nate Torrence and Masi Oka (Hiro on Heroes) are funny as a couple of Maxs fellow geeky analysts who nurse a healthy grudge against the agents but are steadfastly jealous of them. But the draw here is Carell who has become about as dependable a comedy actor as there is in Hollywood. Even if hes appearing in a lesser project - Evan Almighty makes Get Smart look like Annie Hall in comparison - he maintains a winning-against-the-odds vibe that makes him a welcome presence. Its not as if you dont know how things are going to turn out generally speaking. But you find yourself rooting for the guy in spite of yourself and in spite of the material. Get Smart then is by no means a great movie. Would you believe . . . a good movie? Would you believe . . . a passable couple of hours with a decent laugh thrown in here and there? And would you be old enough to get that joke in the first place? Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8974.

"Get Smart | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; get-smart ) Get Smart (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Get Smart becomes the latest in a long line of TV series to get a big-screen treatment. While we have come to expect recycled refuse from most of these (Bewitched perhaps occupying the nadir) Get Smart manages to rise above the continuum of regurgitation by walking a tightrope that allows it to appeal to those who have fond memories of the late-1960s spy spoof and those who dont know Don Adams from John Adams. Get Smart is delightfully silly and at times very funny. The characters are likeable and feel connected to their TV counterparts. And although Mel Brooks and Buck Henry (creators of the original) are not directly involved the filmmakers have crafted something that both men would likely agree is in the spirit of what they shepherded to the small screen. Get Smart opens by re-creating the credits of the original with Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) walking through a seemingly endless series of locking doors until he gets to a telephone booth that transports him into the heart of CONTROL a covert American intelligence agency set up to do battle with its dastardly rival KAOS. CONTROL is presided over by The Chief (Alan Arkin) and Max is its best analyst. When an attack on CONTROL headquarters by KAOS operative Sigfried (Terrence Stamp) eliminates many of CONTROLs agents Max is elevated from analyst to field operative and given the designation of ""Agent 86."" He is partnered with Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) and sent into action. Providing them with support from the home base as they track down Sigfried is Agent 23 (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) who is too well-known to be able to function effectively under cover. Steve Carells portrayal of Max is just about perfect for the material. He doesnt try to ape Don Adams - that would have been a mistake - but theres enough of the late actor in the performance that the original Max hasnt been obfuscated. Carell delivers many of Maxs signature lines (""Would you believea|?"" ""Missed it by THIS much"") with similar inflections. When it comes to re-interpreting a well-established character from the past Carell is far more successful than Steve Martins hatchet job in the remake of The Pink Panther. Theres a little of Barbara Feldon in Anne Hathaways Agent 99 although her outfits and attitudes are more modern. If theres a downside to the casting of Carell and Hathaway its that theres not much romantic chemistry between them (although theyre fine as spy buddies). Then again Adams and Feldon had the leisure of over 100 episodes to develop what Carell and Hathaway have to convey in less than two hours. Get Smart has its share of cameos. Bernie Koppell (the original Sigfried) has a blink-and-youll-miss-it appearance. James Caan (who appeared in two Get Smart episodes) is the President. Bill Murray lives in a tree. And several other Saturday Night Live veterans show their faces. The plot doesnt make a lot of sense - it has to do with KAOS getting its hands on nuclear weapons. As with the series however this is just a skeleton to be fleshed out by gags and physical comedy. While the original Get Smart was a fairly direct satire of the James Bond series this movie version is more an updating of the TV series than a lampoon of spy movies. That sort of thing was done to death by Austin Powers and its sequels. One of the supporting thugs (Dalip Singh) however appears to have been modeled after The Spy Who Loved Mes Jaws. A lot of Get Smart is just plain silly but thats okay because its in keeping with the tone and intent of the TV series. The film is occasionally a little raunchy (as with a scene in which Max appears to be caught in a compromising position with an enemy agent) but theres nothing here that Brooks and Henry wouldnt have tried if 60s TV had permitted it. While a lot of Get Smarts humor is more likely to provoke smiles and chuckles than anything more explosive there are instances when full-bellied laughter could result. The movie also pokes fun at one of my pet peeves the use of ""nucular"" instead of ""nuclear"" by a top politician. If Get Smart faces a hurdle it could be that viewers are tiring of these TV-to-movie transitions (perhaps because so many have been so bad) and Get Smart lacks the cachet of some of its contemporaries. It is not widely available on DVD (only as an entire series box set from Time Life) and thus has not re-entered the popular culture of the 2000s the way so many older TV shows have. This is one instance however when a TV series-based movie rewards nostalgia without demanding it. Get Smart is funny enough in its own right to attract younger viewers while paying homage to its 40-year old predecessor. Director Peter Segal whose resume includes several Adam Sandler movies shows an understanding of what made people laugh in the context of the original Get Smart and applies that knowledge to this contemporary setting. Along with his actors screenwriters and the rest of the crew he has made an enjoyable mid-summer nights comedy. Would you believe that?

This is not a smart move. Brought up to date and turned into an ""action comedy"" by writing team Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember and director Peter Segal the hero of ""Get Smart"" is now a compulsively efficient analyst for the spy agency CONTROL whos eager to abandon his desk job and take to the field just like the agencys dashing macho superstar Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson a.k.a. The Rock). Of course when he gets his big chance to foil the crime syndicate KAOSs plans to detonate nuclear weapons--and also gets to work with the glamorous Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway)--he harpoons himself in the face with one of his Bond-ian gadgets and falls out of an airplane over Russia without a parachute just as youd expect. Except the next moment he morphs into an expert marksman with sharp instincts for foiling KAOSs evil schemes. You cant have it both ways and expect us to keep laughing. In this distressingly generic spy spoof its not Maxwell whos clueless but the filmmakers.Carell is fast becoming a national comic treasure but 20 years from now when hes getting lifetime achievement awards there wont be many clips from this performance. His Smart never achieves deep comic traction. His bickering relationship with the lovely but out-of-her-element Hathaway which of course blooms into a romance generates an occasional mild chuckle but no heat. I knew the movie was in trouble when Smart is mistaken for a terrorist on an airplane and gets tackled by a security agent--its almost identical to a gag in ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" except this time it isnt funny. Alan Arkin is his usual droll self as CONTROLs boss but the script is toothless the writers idea of scathing satire is to have the president (James Caan) fall asleep during a concert. Director Segal--responsible for the dismal ""Nutty Professor II The Klumps"" the grating ""Anger Management"" and the misfired ""50 First Dates""--is a comedy specialist lacking any apparent sense of humor. Making ""Smart"" smart is a classic example of missing the joke.

But in the end a bigscreen version of televisions ""Get Smart"" had issues to address -- the hero was too one-dimensional the female lead too adoring the Cold War too over. It seemed like a natural Redo ""Get Smart"" the landmark 60s TV spy spoof with Steve Carell. Who better to update Maxwell Smart -- the idiot-savantish secret agent originated by Don Adams -- than ""The Offices"" master of disassociative self-effacing humor? But in the end a bigscreen version of televisions ""Get Smart"" had issues to address -- the hero was too one-dimensional the female lead too adoring the Cold War too over. So helmer Peter Segals formulaic takeoff is neither fish nor fowl not quite faithful to the show but not quite bringing it into the 21st century either. It may ride Carells star to major B.O. at least initially. But its nothing you want to take off your shoe and call home about. In changing the tone of the original NBC sitcom Segals ""Get Smart"" creates a more endearing Max. Scripters Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember have concocted an origin story that tells how Maxwell Smart became the man he was Rather than the Inspector Clouseau-esque oblivious-to-insult hero played by Adams Carells Max is an eager sincere sensitive efficient analyst for the mysterious U.S. espionage agency CONTROL. Hes a first-rate wonk but he longs to be an agent in the field. He wants to fight and shoot. He passes the agents exam with flying colors. But as the Chief (Alan Arkin) tells him hes too valuable where he is. So Max is destined to stay indoors (many doors slamming shut behind him) and prepare his notoriously boring reports for the likes of Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson) who is out there every day making the world safe for democracy. It is only when KAOS -- CONTROLs nemesis led by the evil Siegfried (a thoroughly wasted Terence Stamp) -- manages to compromise virtually every CONTROL agent that Max gets his long-dreamed-of promotion -- and the movie gets going. Theres no one else the Chief can to turn to except Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) whos had a total rhinoplastic makeover and is thus still under cover. Can Max rise to the challenge? Can he survive his partnership with 99? Theres a lot of nodding and winking toward the old show including Maxs musical march through the multiple security gates that also introduced the Mel Brooks/Buck Henry-created series. This is a good thing because otherwise we might forget that were watching ""Get Smart"" at all. We might in fact imagine wed wandered into some other cookie-cutter comedy one in which we expect romance-edged jousting between principals. This is the biggest tonal change from the original ""Get Smart"" Agent 99 who was played in the 60s by Barbara Feldon as a Max-worshipping vamp (and who was better at spying than Max was) has become someone more independent but also a little shrewish. Hathaways 99 is more capable than Max but isnt prepared to do anything to mollify the ego of her less-experienced partner. On the contrary theirs is a relationship based on competition and bickering -- which is frankly all very conventional spy-vs.-spy/war-of-the-sexes stuff that abandons the daffy spirit that Brooks and Henry cooked up. Granted times have changed and a compliant 99 might not cut it with contemporary audiences. But a lot of the comedy seems to have been lost in the translation. On one hand Carell is a total nerd; on the other hes too self-aware and nuanced to be an homage to the original Max. The genius of his Michael Scott on ""The Office"" doesnt come through here and it might have because Scott and (the original) Maxwell Smart share a clinical distance from their fellow humans that accounts for and perhaps excuses their behavior. Carells Max is decent deserving subtly witty and comic which makes him far more appropriate as both a Carell character and a modern hero. But hes not always a perfect fit as the centerpiece of spy farce. There is a lingering affection among some groups for the TV show and among young auds for Carell who has shown that he is perfectly capable of stretching as an actor as in ""Little Miss Sunshine.""
