But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Such is the case with ""Pieces of April"" a wobbly but good-hearted indie from first-time director Peter Hedges. At barely 81 minutes its a mere wisp of a story in which a suburban family heads to New York City for a Thanksgiving dinner hosted by its most rebellious member daughter April (Katie Holmes). This may well be the Burns last holiday meal together as mother Joy (Patricia Clarkson) is in the late stages of illness. So yes fasten your seat belts -- its a dysfunctional family/Thanksgiving/road trip movie and it takes a few detours before its final destination. The film takes place in the space of one day; scenes of April struggling through dinner preparations in her grubby tenement flat are interspersed with tense moments in the family car loaded with Mom Dad senile Grandma surly brother Timmy and chirpy sister Beth. Its two very different universes both depicted with little subtlety April lives in the Apartment House of Stereotypes in which all of her diverse neighbors are defined by their race or their beliefs; the Burns sterile-white world looks lifeless and frozen as if it hasnt changed for decades. Movie review  ""Pieces of April"" with Katie Holmes Patricia Clarkson Derek Luke Oliver Platt John Gallagher Jr. Alison Pill. Written and directed by Peter Hedges. 81 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language sensuality drug content and images of nudity. Guild 45th. Nonetheless the film grows on you. Hedges understands the emotional pull of the Thanksgiving holiday for a troubled family (or for any family; well all fill in our own holiday memories while watching this film) and you find yourself rooting for April whose tattoos and punky tatters cant hide a fundamentally sweet nature. In her filthy kitchen she shoves whole celery stalks into the turkey cavity frets about recipes crosses things off her to-do list wonders where her boyfriend Bobby (Derek Luke) has got to -- and ends up making the rounds of the building in search of a working stove. Meanwhile in the car Clarkson is working a small miracle with the role of Joy. Sitting amid the familys whirlwind of false cheer and careful tiptoeing she gives this woman a wry sense of humor -- cancer has given her a get-out-of-jail-free card and she knows it. When the insufferable Beth (Alison Pill so good at playing a twit that you want to slap her) entertains the car with a lifeless aria Joy flatly tells her to stop; its as if shes been wanting to say that for years. This mother is no saint; shes deeply conflicted in her feelings toward her daughter -- how can she love April when April grew up determined to be unlovable? Nonetheless Joy wants to make a memory one that will overcome the pain we see in her eyes. The Burns family isnt Christmas-card perfect and neither is this movie. (In particular Bobbys subplot though played with a touching gentleness by Luke is unnecessary and contrived.) ""Pieces of April"" is ultimately a tear-jerker but not for the reason you might guess. The tears are earned; the flaws are forgiven; Hedges has shown us in the end a picture of love.

Starring Katie Holmes Patricia Clarkson Oliver Platt. Directed and written by Peter Hedges. (PG-13. 81 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Peter Hedges has done something remarkable with ""Pieces of April"" his directorial debut. Hes made a movie about family -- one with a holiday theme no less -- thats both heartfelt and tough-minded. The tale of a black-sheep daughter (Katie Holmes) making Thanksgiving dinner for her suburban clan avoids sentimentality at every turn and truly earns both its laughs and its tears. The movie works as an ensemble piece but one that might have collapsed without its center the magnificent Patricia Clarkson. As Aprils mother a holy terror in the last stages of cancer Clarkson delivers her finest performance among about 100 fine Clarkson performances in the past few years. Oscar simply cannot continue to ignore her. Her character is both hilarious and maddening an alto-voiced fount of one-liners and backhanded compliments. During a drive to New York City the mother tells her younger daughter (played with heartbreaking neediness by Alison Pill) ""Youre just like me except for your slight weight problem."" She saves her most poisonous barbs for April however urging her family to fill up on doughnuts so they dont have to eat her cooking. Related Stories Fraught holiday in Pieces of April Hedges who helped create another likable curmudgeon in his script for Hugh Grants ""About a Boy"" alternates scenes of the familys lollygagging car trip with Aprils attempts to cook a turkey despite a broken oven. The pictures framework poses the chicken-or-egg question of what came first Aprils sullen behavior or her mothers denouncement of her as a lost cause. The latter seems more likely. April bristles at the Thanksgiving salt-and- pepper shakers her sweet boyfriend (Derek Luke from ""Antwone Fisher"") has bought. She recalls that when she was a child her mother cautioned her not to break a similar pair of knickknacks because they were worth more than she was. Clad in her characters punk-rock armor of magenta hair and smudged eyeliner Holmes does a subtle job of portraying the high stakes of this family feast. April knows this might be her last chance for a reconciliation and the broken oven heightens her stress. With a set jaw and forced smile Holmes shows the effort it takes for her character to make nice. April cant resist popping off to a neighbor (played by Sean Hayes of ""Will amp; Grace"") even though hes let her borrow his oven. Holmes face registers instant regret and the moment gives us insight into what her family has endured all these years. Hedges use of digital video gives ""April"" an intimacy and also a slightly seedy quality. The director captures the queasy trappings of this particular American holiday -- of people riding a long way in a car slightly cold and dressed in uncomfortable formal clothes so they can arrive somewhere and eat too much. April has her dad in her corner at least. Oliver Platt provides a steadying force as a man staving off his own sadness to buoy his family. When the mother laments that Aprils current beau is probably just another in a long list of losers her husband assures her this is not the case ""She says he reminds her of me"" he says and the look of fatherly pride on Platts face is priceless. The familys starting point isnt clear and the trip seems to take an awfully long time. They could have set out from Connecticut or New Jersey or Venus for all it matters; the journey symbolizes the gulf between mother and daughter. The extended travel time also lets Clarkson do her thing building an arc from bitter certainty to glimmers of hope. Advisory This film contains raw language sexual situations nudity.

""Apparently"" he says ""this guy Bobby reminds her of me"" The audience is meant to chortle at his innocent misperception since Pieces of April has already established that Bobby (Derek Luke) is black. Were meant to think ""Boy does Dad have a surprise coming"" But wait a minute Why exactly is this a joke? Is it supposed to be ridiculous that Bobby could remind April of her father? Or that Jim might think so himself? The quaint racial blinders are really on the eyes of the filmmaker Peter Hedges who shoves his characters into the narrowest of sitcom slots and seals them there. ""Pieces of April"" is only 81 minutes long and it was shot on digital video in a scrappy low-budget style that declares its homespun plainness in every shot. The entire movie unfolds on Thanksgiving as Hedges cuts back and forth between the Burns family in their station wagon squabbling and reminiscing as they cruise along the freeway toward New York City and April in her Lower East Side walk-up as she frantically tries to cajole one of her neighbors into lending her the use of an oven so that she can prepare the big turkey roast. (Her own oven is on the blink.) The setup is appealingly small-scale yet the films tone is one of fake intimacy - shtick parading as quirky truth. Aprils haplessness in the kitchen is an overstated gag and who are her neighbors? Lets put it this way ""sassy"" middle-aged black couple wacky psycho cat guy sullen psycho vegan and Sean Hayes as an anal-retentive yuppie whos like Norman Bates gone ""Queer Eye."" April is supposed to be the angry prodigal daughter who has spent her life at war with her mother but all we see in Katie Holmes is the soul of softness and light. The one glint of honest comedy in ""Pieces of April"" comes from Patricia Clarksons exuberantly hostile performance as Joy Burns who isnt just wisecracking through her breast-cancer therapy - shes laughing tearful yet open-eyed at the grave. A viewer can embrace Clarkson even as the Instamatic feel-good ending violates everything she brings to the movie.

Peter Hedges background as playwright novelist and screenwriter (""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape"" ""About a Boy"") serves him well in his directing bow ""Pieces of April"" a Thanksgiving family reunion comedy that sparkles with acerbic wit original characters and genuine heart. Fostered by IFCs digital arm InDigEnt the film suffers from a rather flat visual quality as well as from unevenness in energy levels. But its fine cast infectious humor and a sweet emotional payoff combining a strong sense of family with a broader spirit of community should make this small but disarming feature a moderately commercial venture. Setting up the action and sketching the characters with economy and precision Hedges opens on family black sheep April Burns (Katie Holmes) and her African-American boyfriend Bobby (Derek Luke) in their seedy Manhattan walk-up chaotically preparing for Thanksgiving dinner. Meanwhile at their upstate N.Y. suburban home Burns family members steel themselves to share in this meal anticipating disaster from the petulant April. Aprils mother Joy (Patricia Clarkson) is in the terminal stages of cancer and is stoically dreading the encounter with her errant daughter. The films liveliest humor is found in the barbed observations of this difficult angry woman -- deliciously delivered in Clarksons lovely performance -- and in her wicked delight in making fun of her cosseting familys solemnity and concern for her condition. Joys well-intentioned husband (Oliver Platt) seems alone in his willingness to give April a second chance while self-righteous Beth (Alison Pill) masks the resentment she feels for her older sister with over-protectiveness toward her mother. Weed-smoking photographer brother Timmy (John Gallagher Jr.) is along for the lark while grandma (Alice Drummond) is sliding into senility. The family journeys toward New York City making stops for junk food and to bury road kill along the way as April confronts her limited cooking skills and an oven previously used only for storage. She turns -- in some of the films funniest scenes -- to a good-humored black couple downstairs (Lillias White Isiah Whitlock) who frown at her white-girl helplessness. When the couples own dinner preparations take precedence April begins a door-knocking campaign in a quest to find another working oven. This leads her to the deluxe new stove of Wayne (Sean Hayes). But her lack of apparent gratitude results in Wayne going AWOL taking Aprils half-cooked turkey hostage. While theres nothing wrong with ""Will amp; Grace"" star Hayes impish performance the forced eccentricity of the character and the sitcommy feel to this strand contribute to a dip in the proceedings after the buoyant opening. Also at fault are the too-frequent digressions to track the activity of boyfriend Bobby -- sent off to give April run of the kitchen -- which weakens the key dynamic of the two gradually converging poles of the Burns familys road trip and Aprils neighbor-hopping escapades. Despite this however Hedges skillfully pulls all the elements together in a satisfying final act laced with further setbacks and unexpectedly harmonious solutions that gracefully sidestep scenes of saccharine reconciliation. Balancing her characters edges by presenting an indifferent exterior while quietly reaching out to repair the damage Holmes gives one of her best film perfs. Platt Pill Gallagher Jr. and Drummond all score with humorously drawn characters bouncing off each other in appealing ways in scenes that mostly take place in a moving car. But while she never dominates the ensemble its the extraordinary Clarkson who anchors the comedy revealing the vulnerability and sorrow under Joys dry humor in measured doses that make the conclusion moving without pushing the sentimental envelope. The gentle mellow contributions of New York singer-songwriter Stephin Merritt add significantly to the films affectionate mood. The modest productions only technical shortcoming is its lifeless visual patina.
