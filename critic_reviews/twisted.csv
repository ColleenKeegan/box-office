EntertainmentMoviesMusic Twisted Sister doc will make you wanna rock Originally published February 18 2016 at 257 pm Updated February 18 2016 at 426 pm The documentary ""We Are Twisted Fing Sister"" includes candid interviews with frontman Dee Snider. A new documentary about glam rock band Twisted Sister is stuffed with fascinating footage and anecdotes about the groups rise from ragtag bar band to platinum-selling chart-toppers. Share story By Jeff Albertson Special to The Seattle Times Andrew Horns documentary ""We Are Twisted Fing Sister"" chronicles the rise of the Long Island N.Y. rock band that conquered 80s glam metal with outrageous videos and fist-pumping anthems. Its a fascinating glimpse into a long-gone era. Using a trove of archival footage and memorabilia the story is told by the band managers and its devout fans over the course of 134 wildly entertaining minutes. Horn follows the group from its inception as a ragtag bar band in the early 1970s right up to the point when it breaks big. We see the band slogging it out playing cover songs in clubs but releasing original music and pounding on doors trying to get a record deal. Movie Review1/2   We Are Twisted Fing Sister a documentary directed by Andrew Horn. 134 minutes. Not rated; for mature audiences. Grand Illusion through Thursday. Horns use of raw early footage proves that Twisted Sister was able to draw thousands of die-hard fans to its raucous and over-the-top shows in the Long Island and New Jersey area. The highlight of this period was a sold-out gig at New Yorks 3000-capacity Palladium -- all without a recording contract or radio airplay.

Some of the anecdotes such as the time the band hanged and beat an effigy of Barry White onstage while singing a song called ""Disco Sucks"" are cringe-inducing and out of touch which Snider admits with embarrassment and remorse. Oddly the film lacks any footage of Twisted Sisters videos or hit songs which received heavy rotation on MTV. That may be a drawback for casual fans but the juicy details about the bands early days make up for it.

Credit Music Box Films ""We went through a succession of drummers"" one member of the titular band in ""We Are Twisted _______ Sister"" recalls at a relatively late point in this largely fascinating but arguably overlong documentary directed by Andrew Horn. That should ring a bell with aficionados of rock docs both actual and fictional and the movie does contain further echoes of the classic comedy ""This Is Spinal Tap."" A crucial difference is that this films subjects and particularly the core members Jay Jay French and Dee Snider are polar opposites of Taps pitifully un-self-conscious dim bulbs.Mr. French the bands guitarist kicks off the movie by telling how he ditched his flirtation with recreational substances in the early 70s to seriously focus on a career as a gigging rock musician inspired by the glitter movement. Mr. Snider the groups relentlessly outrageous frontman recalls how his time as a high-school outcast helped him hone his performing chops.The movie tells an incomplete version of the bands story -- it ends before the recording of its best-known anthem ""Were Not Gonna Take It"" recently a feature of Donald J. Trumps presidential campaign -- but provides a comprehensive and sometimes harrowing portrayal of the grind a working bar band in the 1970s had to endure to get by.Mishaps and intrigues along the way include a misfiring audience-participation antidisco shtick and the unnerving prospect of the heavily made-up group playing for a few thousand grungy Motorhead partisans. Sex is lightly touched upon drugs are practically nonexistent -- both Mr. Snider and Mr. French are teetotalers -- and rock n roll runs on two parts passion to three parts pragmatism. What Twisted Sister definitely shared for a time with Spinal Tap was freakishly persistent bad luck extending to one executive promising to sign the band to a record deal and then dying on a plane home mere hours later.

Comments We Are Twisted Fucking Sister 136 minutes  2014 Spanning two and a quarter hours this documentary chronicles the humble beginnings of Long Island glam-metal outfit Twisted Sister best known for their 1984 megahit ""Were Not Gonna Take It."" Director Andrew Horn covers every trial and tribulation in the dozen years leading up to Twisted Sisters major-label debut on Atlantic Records. The running time may seem daunting to even the most dedicated Sick Mother Fucker (as the bands fan club members are called) but front man Dee Snyder is charming and the movie is crammed with great archival footage of the band ranging from their early days as a David Bowie cover act to their jamming onstage with Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead on British TV.

Automatic catnip for fans and rewarding for those previously indifferent to or even hostile towards the veteran Long Island combo this persuasive paean to sheer bloody-minded persistence flies by over the course of 136 engrossing often hilarious minutes. A sure-fire crowdpleaser for film-festivals on the back of well-received world-premiere screenings at Amsterdams prestigious IDFA the US-German co-production warrants art-house distribution in those many territories where Twisted Sister retain a loyal cult following. Made with the outfits approval and extensive on-screen involvement writer-director-producer Andrew Horns belated follow-up to The Nomi Song (2004) also has the makings of a lucrative small-screen offering further down the line. In The Nomi Song -- a profile of androgynously operatic underground performer Klaus Nomi -- a New Jersey support-slot for raucous Yankee headbangers Twisted Sister was presented as the nadir of the hyper-sophisticated Berlin artistes bizarre career. By the end of Horns latest enterprise however viewers may wonder if in fact it was Nomis zenith. Because while they may be nobodys idea of groundbreaking contributors to musical history -- none of the songs excerpted are much to write home about -- Twisted Sisters full-blooded full-throttle commitment to old-fashioned show-biz principles to giving their countless audiences one hell of a good time is utterly and admirably unwavering. Horns masterstroke is to resist the urge to distil four decades of history into a single film instead concentrating almost entirely on the 1972-82 period during which Twisted Sister gradually emerged as the unchallenged kings of the ""Long Island bar scene"" then started patiently knocking on the door of national and international fame. Eschewing the hip but tiny Manhattan clubs the band instead played the less fashionable but much bigger (and thus enormously more lucrative) venues around the tri-State area amassing a huge following across suburban New York New Jersey and Connecticut. A large part of their appeal lay in the larger-than-life flamboyance of Dee Snider who only joined the fray around 1976 -- but who as we see from grainy contemporary video-footage instantly established himself as an obviously great front-man and terrific vocalist. A self-confessed ""rube"" and ""dork"" Snider garnered much attention for his trash-transvestite stage-garb ultra-confrontational punker-than-punk approach and spectacularly garish make-up. Anyone coming to We Are Twisted F--ing Sister expecting lurid Spinal Tap-esque tales of drink-fueled drug-crazed heavy-metal excess is however in for a major surprise. Both Snider and the bands founding member guitarist Jay Jay French were ""straight edge"" avant la lettre assiduously eschewing both alcoholic and narcotic stimulation. This perhaps explains the duos Stakhanovite work-rate and ultra-professional commitment to their touring craft taking their shtick-punctuated show on the road most nights in the week and selling out large prestigious venues in the late seventies without the benefit of airplay or a record-deal. Its the pursuit of the latter which provides We Are Twisted F--ing Sister with a solid narrative spine as misfortune piles upon calamity in what seems like a vain pursuit of major-label interest. Not for the first or last time Twisted Sister were at a crucial stage prophets without honor in their own country relying on encouragement and interest from the United Kingdom at a time when the big Stateside players wouldnt give them the time of day. Assembling a slick professional package with the assistance of two editors Horn sticks to the tried-and-tested formula of talking-heads interviewees and archival footage. And he strikes gold on both fronts. The video clips are boisterously energetic while the now middle-aged Snider and French are articulate and genial the pair boasting a lively and detailed recall of their 1970s exploits. Various managers club-owners and fans provide wider background -- one devotee chats happily away in a nightclub toilet -- and We Are Twisted F--ing Sister only benefits from the fact that Horn is clearly an interested curious observer rather than any kind of obsessive aficionado incapable of obtaining proper distance from his material.

In unabashedly epitomizing excess they represented the high-water mark of hair metal which if nothing else inspired the ripostes of grunge and alt-rock. (Whether you consider that a good thing I leave to you.) Too bad We Are Twisted Fucking Sister embodies the bands brashness in title only soberly charting their groupie-chasing early days through their chased-by-groupies peak with the usual mix of archival footage and talking heads. Andrew Horns documentary also ends somewhat curiously just as frontman Dee Snider and the other principals finish recounting their ascent -- their entire career post-Stay Hungry (read ""Were Not Gonna Take It"" ""I Wanna Rock"" and a stunned Tipper Gore) is relegated to a title card before the credits start rolling. Film Details We Are Twisted Fng Sister RatingNR GenreDocumentary Running Time134 min. More Info EXPAND Crowdfunded in 2014 We Are Twisted Fucking Sister comprehensively documents this origin story in a way thats clearly geared toward diehards; calling a movie too long is among the least useful of all critical judgments but you could almost listen to the bands first five albums in the 135 minutes it takes to watch this cut-and-dried doc.
