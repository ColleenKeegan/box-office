But it turns out comparison isnt needed to appreciate the durable charms of Old Ironsides himself Arnold Schwarzenegger. Suited up once again in the blocky cyborgs iconic Village People leatherwear after an absence of a dozen years a fearsomely well-moisturized Schwarzenegger stars as a collectors-edition replica of the T-800 that was destroyed for the good of mankind in 1991s ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day."" In ""T3"" the replicant - now renumbered T-101 - lands in Los Angeles to fight off a state-of-the-art T-X killing machine (Kristanna Loken suitably unsettlingly vacant) a comely model stalking the citys vulnerable streets. And with him we return to a franchise we never knew we missed surprisingly grateful for the stars generosity - and evident pleasure - in strapping on the old sunglasses and blasting adversaries to hell. Tops on T-Xs to-do list before machines can rule the earth in the expressionless wrinkle-free future is to kill a couple of humans who stand in the way of world domination John (Nick Stahl) the now-grown son of the late freedom fighter Sarah Connor (so memorably sculpted by Linda Hamilton) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) a do-gooding veterinarian linked by misty fate to Connor. Tops on T-101s agenda meanwhile is proving that a story born out of the chrome-y clang of the 1980s - a durable alloy of Schwarzeneggers schnitzel appeal and director James Camerons apocalyptic vision - has a place in a very different action-hero world in a sequel made without Cameron and starring a middle-aged specimen of Austrian precision engineering and American body-shop repair. (As it is with cyborgs and movie stars the aging takes place in the internal combustion system while the casing looks smooth as ever.) That ""T3"" fulfills its assignment so ably is a triumph of brain taking over where brawn can no longer prevail What Schwarzenegger lacks in speed and agility he director Jonathan Mostow and screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris make up for in bright heavy metal charm unexpectedly lively and self-aware wit and a sure sense of when to stop fussing with special effects and just let Arnolds famous ""doan doo dot"" Teutonic-Conehead monotone work its low-tech magic.

Here is the first movie of its kind in many moons that doesnt have to labor Hulk- or Charlies Angels-style over convincing you of how entertaining it is. Heres a picture that you actually want to see a second time not for the sake of further wrapping your head around its gnarly conceptual matrix but because of the sheer visceral charge it provides. Here at long last is a summer movie -- like its precursors in the Terminator canon -- worth its weight in cybernetic organisms. Released in 1984 The Terminator -- with its crudely elegant stop-motion effects by Stan Winston -- was a crackerjack specimen of lyrical bargain-basement sci-fi on the run revving up the career of writer-director James Cameron and demonstrating that its hulking Austrian star with the unpronounceable last name might indeed be destined for greater things than Conan the Barbarian. Taking his cue from George Butler who spotlighted the engaging young Schwarzenegger in his 1977 weightlifting documentary Pumping Iron it was Cameron who first seemed clued in to how deadpan-funny Ah-nuld could be. Seven years later Terminator 2 Judgment Day was not only among the first movies to feature eight zeroes in its budget but was the first ever to become better-known by its ad-slick acronym (T2) than by its proper title. In making the upgrade some of the intimacy and economy of the first movie had been sacrificed T2 was both blunter about its anti-nuclear message and murkier in its stance on modern technology. Yet the movie was a bona fide phenomenon (and deservedly so; few films of any kind have carried two-plus hours of running time more breathlessly) packing such a revolution in visual effects that movies would spend most of the next decade trying to catch up (until one called The Matrix finally did). On top of which in deftly reworking the premise of Shane Cameron had managed to turn the impassive Schwarzenegger -- who had uttered not more than a dozen lines in the original film -- into a heroic (if monolithic) father figure inadvertently laying the groundwork for the actors gubernatorial bid. Cameron seems to have intended for things to end there. Likely he felt some of the same anxiety thats been nagging at audiences ever since T3 was first announced -- that the idea of surpassing T2s accomplishments on a technical level alone was the very definition of a fools errand.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Nothing though is impossible and certainly not where billion-dollar movie franchises are concerned. Not having created the series director Mostow (late of the submarine thriller U-571) doesnt have to give a second thought to the notion of topping himself. He knows he cant outscale T2s grandiosity and he doesnt try -- thats his special freedom. Instead hes gone back to basics to the B-movie beauty of the one that started it all (no matter that T3 cost even more than T2) gambling that audiences -- weakened after the June gloom of forbidding morose or enervatingly hyperactive comic-book movies -- are jonesing for just such a down-and-dirty jugular shot of high-test adrenaline. At the same time Rise of the Machines may be the most respectful inheritance of a franchise by new filmmakers since Cameron himself got his hands on Aliens. The screenplay credited to The Games John Brancato and Michael Ferris riffs joyfully on its predecessors opening with the familiar ""arrival"" sequences in which the terminators casually appear -- crouched down fully nude and encapsulated in transparent balls -- somewhere on the streets of Los Angeles. From there its on to the ritual of obtaining clothes and vehicles in the course of which the souped-up T-X (the latest terminator model played by newcomer Kristanna Loken) shows even less trepidation and much less tact than the venerable T-101 (Schwarzenegger carrying his 55 years with unexpected grace). The T-X is more than just the liquid-metal descendant of Robert Patricks stone-cold T-1000; with her fiery female exterior and inflatable bust she can get a lot more accomplished with a lot less effort. (Its hard to imagine anyone not answering the door for her.) And did I mention that her right arm can at a moments notice transform itself into a plasma-firing ray gun? Of course both machines are after the same thing John Connor (Nick Stahl) destined -- if he survives -- to become the leader of human resistance in the coming war of man and machine. (When you think about it its amazing how much juice this now-trilogy has had given that each film works through what is essentially the exact same plot.) Since apparently saving the world at the end of the last installment Connor has been living ""off the grid"" meaning that both the T-X (programmed to destroy not just Connor but those who will become his lieutenants in the resistance) and the T-101 (mission to protect and serve) have a spot of trouble locating the now-20-something. And when they do its in the supply room of a veterinary clinic where the druggie dropout Connor has broken in for a quick fix of benzodiazepine. This is also where Connor meets up with Claire Danes Kate Brewster a veterinary nurse destined -- in one of those indelible time-travel-movie paradoxes -- not only to become his future wife but to send the T-101 back from the future to save him.   Why you might ask is all this happening after Connor (with help from Linda Hamilton and that other T-101) evidently destroyed every shred of scientist Joe Mortons research more than a decade ago the very research that left unchecked would have been used to develop the Skynet computer software that would in turn develop a HAL 9000-like instinct for self-preservation and eliminate all those (namely humans) who stood in its way? Lets just say that Brancato and Ferris do pull an explanation out of their hat and that its not the most compelling trick in their considerable repertoire. (Whereas Cameron in T2 saw that every last unanswered question from the first movie had been satisfactorily nailed down.) Only a true grinch though is likely to grouse about an infidelity to narrative logic which allows for a movie that affords so much pleasure. Which is to assume that said grinch will have enough time to chop such logic in the thick of T3s mania. Which isnt at all likely. Thirty minutes or less into T3 just for starters comes the car chase to end all car chases an elaboration on the motorcycle-versus-18-wheeler pursuit at the start of T2 but with the big-rig here replaced by an even wider load -- a 100-ton crane driven by the T-X that upturns other vehicles like matchbox cars and reduces entire buildings to rubble in one fell swoop. Just when you think things are slowing down theyre really kicking into high gear The chase goes on and on (and on some more) dazzling us with its explosive real-time mayhem its orgiastic stunt work and its sparing use of computer effects. Whats more Mostow keeps up that feverish pitch not only for the chase scene but for just about everything that follows up to and including a dynamite bathroom brawl between the two terminators. Rather than relying upon the slo-mo Hong Kong-style fight choreography that has become so de rigueur (and so unconscionably bastardized) in the wake of The Matrix Mostow allows his actors to smash together and spring apart with Looney Tunes ferocity. The energys right there in the camera and thus doesnt have to be manufactured later in the editing room. Imagine an action movie where the action is so carefully storyboarded and blocked out we can actually follow it Its the same sensibility Mostow brought to his first theatrical feature 1997s Breakdown the crazed jolt after welcome jolt that comes from a filmmaker pouring his heart and soul and every good idea hes ever had into a movie. Its also where the filmmaker shows his true kinship with Cameron While they draw from considerably different aesthetic palates (Mostow has brought a new cameraman composer and team of editors to the project) theyre born of the same irrepressible vaudevillian desire to give us more than we bargained for to put on a better-than-good showstopping show. And thats just what Mostows done Hes made the summer movie audiences have been waiting for come to save us like our own personal T-101 from one more regrettable night out at the multiplex.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 1 2003 738 PM The Terminator at 55 The robot-crushes-man franchise shows its age. By David Edelstein Not quite terminated The big guy is back The director James Cameron might be a legendary prick but he has a stubbornly romantic faith in the power of heroic individuals to take arms against their seemingly intractable fates. In Aliens (1986) and The Abyss (1989) people sacrifice themselves for just causes and are rousingly reborn. In Titanic (1997) the luxury liner sinks but the love goes soaringly on. In The Terminator (1984) and its blockbuster sequel Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) the apocalypse is forestalled against titanic odds and the future is once more gloriously open. The Terminator saga was over after T2--convincingly over wrapped-up. But it turns out that there is a historical inevitability stronger than Cameron or even Karl Marx could have conceived the relentless drive to make sequels. Advertisement The director of Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines (Warner Bros.)--the first Terminator film without James Cameron at the helm (or even in the credits)--is Jonathan Mostow who made the preposterous but engagingly fluid B movie Breakdown (1997) along with the all-time-best sound-effects editing demonstration reel U-571 (2000). There has been a lot of speculation about whether he can live up to Camerons legacy--but were not talking The Godfather (1972) and The Godfather Part 2 (1974) here. The original was a crackerjack New Wave B movie that turned the joke that was Arnold Schwarzenegger into a joke that the muscle-bound Austrian was suddenly in on. The sequel was basically one long chase with state-of-the-art (for 1991) computer effects. A lot of people walked out of T2 all pumped up and with their ears ringing which you could say about a monster-truck rally. Still there was something nice about it. At the time its female action hero Sarah Connor (a muscled-up Linda Hamilton) was a novelty and its futuristic family was strangely endearing mom son and lumpy-jawed Teutonic ex-terminator. In T3 the saga begins all over again The latest Terminator assassin arrives naked from the future kills someone for a wardrobe then goes off to murder the (future) leader of the resistance against the machines. Then a protector arrives naked from the future but manages to get a wardrobe without killing anyone. The rest of the template is intact chase breather for exposition bigger chase more exposition then a chase that just happens to lead some place with a handy hydraulic press or foundry. But T3 has a few significant variations. Hamilton--Camerons ex--wanted nothing to do with the picture which is co-produced by another Cameron ex Gayle Anne Hurd. So Sarah Connor is history. Her son John now played by Nick Stahl is 22 years old and a drifter. No longer destined to save the world he supposedly already saved hes reduced to breaking into an animal hospital to steal phenobarbital. In a handy coincidence (or is it?) the vet on call Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) turns out to be the daughter of the general in charge of Skynet the supercomputer that sent those Terminators back from the future in the first place. But the biggest change--apart from the finale--is that the latest model Terminator the TX is a fembot (Kristanna Loken) that can morph into other people plug into machines and make them do her bidding and use her hand like a laser cannon. Loken is a persuasive android (she can throw people around without altering her expression) but she isnt as much fun as T2s Robert Patrick who had a sort of newly hatched blankness with stuck-out ears that gave him the look of an especially willful 5-year-old. The joke was that Cameron had found someone smugger and blanker than Schwarzenegger. The joke here if you can call it that is watching Arnold bash a pretty blondes head through a urinal to no visible effect. The audience awaits the arrival of the big guy and I must say With 40-year-old Demi Moore going bod-to-bod with Cameron Diaz in a bikini in the terrible new Charlies Angels picture and the 55-year-old Schwarzenegger showing off his rock-hard gluteals its been a banner year for personal trainers and plastic surgeons. Schwarzenegger gets to total cars and deliver deadpan understatements like ""We need a new vehicle"" and hes constantly in search of the right pair of shades. He has an absurdist comeback in one scene ""Talk to the hand."" But hes not the same lovable robot from T2. He has a different origin a different history and a different agenda. Has John found another surrogate dad or is there something different about this Terminator? Three quarters of T3 consists of the heroes being chased in cars SUVs fire trucks helicopters--and what is there to say? Mostow and his team do a fine job of demolishing vehicles trashing buildings and blowing things up real good. Virtually indestructible machines throw each other through walls and get up and do it again--and again. The villain comes back more times than Wile E. Coyote. I found it tiresome and witless and numbingly repetitive but action mavens wont feel cheated. And its probably good that there isnt much dialogue since whats there is largely tin-eared. Stahl does well by John Hes wiry but depressive overly defended but touchingly vulnerable. Danes however is shrill and painful to watch. She looked adorable and sexy with a touch of baby fat but shes the latest in an endless line of young Hollywood actresses to starve herself down to the bone. Stop the madness Speaking of madness ... T3 has a climactic plot twist that should not be revealed but cant be ignored either. Lets just say that this is the rare sequel that both slavishly duplicates its predecessors and at the same time demolishes their philosophical underpinnings. Im sure Cameron did quite nicely selling off the rights to his characters but I wonder if he isnt mightily pissed off at the grotesquely opportunistic direction that the new movie takes. What does it profit a filmmaker to gain a sequel but lose the world? A few hundred million apparently. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

(   1/2) Will Arnolds political ambitions kill the Terminator? The question isnt just whether it was worth the 12-year wait. Its also whether T3 will hasten star Arnold Schwarzeneggers entry into politics. It could. In theaters tonight to get a jump on the holiday T3 begins promisingly and entertains for a stretch because you think its leading to something more than one of the movie years flattest conclusions. Schwarzenegger still looks spectacular but the script is short on deadpan zingers and his heart doesnt seem in it. The 100-minute story begins with a world thats about to end again which could be part of its problem. Turns out T2s Judgment Day came and went in 1997 after Skynets machine network failed to kill planet savior John Connor (then played by teenager Edward Furlong). Well its a new day with new Skynet chicanery and a new cyborg a voluptuous T-X (Kristanna Loken) so full of tricks that she can enlarge her breasts to abet seduction. Its a shame that T-X and Schwarzeneggers new Terminator (a replica of the old) cant fall in love and raise kiddie cyborgs. But shes programmed to be bad hes programmed to be good and theyre too busy bashing each others heads with urinals and other blunt objects. Caught up in all this is 22-year-old Connor now played by In the Bedrooms Nick Stahl still looking pale and unfed. The woman in his life also fleeing T-X is a vet played by Claire Danes. She has a fiance but forget about him. Hell be dead soon. New director Jonathan Mostow is clearly spending in Camerons price range as he orchestrates tornado-caliber destruction of city streets. The movie is extraordinary in the way that it brutally kills innocent characters or destroys their homes before blithely cutting to another scene and ignoring the ramifications. At least T-X and the stunts make it a better movie than Ronald Reagans final screen hero role in Hellcats of the Navy. That forced the actor into politics as much by necessity as choice.

Mick LaSalle says third time is no charm. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines Action. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger Nick Stahl and Claire Danes. Directed by Jonathan Mostow. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The once-glorious ""Terminator"" franchise -- that elevated Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron to prominence introduced catch-phrases and brought morphing and computer graphics to the level of art -- has hit a wall in its third installment. ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" has its moments and Schwarzenegger is as buff and tough as ever. But theres a flat feeling about this effort thats unmistakable and inescapable. A sense of occasion of something grand and spectacular happening is nowhere to be found on screen this time. Big things happen in ""Terminator 3"" -- in one scene Arnold holds onto a crane as it smashes through an entire city blocks worth of stores -- but none of it lands with the appropriate feeling of import. Perhaps we can blame director Jonathan Mostow for not maintaining the operatic pitch that Cameron brought to the first two ""Terminators."" Mainly the problem is a weak story that throughout seems to be building toward something it never quite reaches. In ""T-2"" Schwarzenegger -- playing a cyborg assassin turned cyborg protector -- had to go up against a more advanced cyborg killing machine. Lacking a better idea the writers of ""T-3"" have him once again going up against a more advanced model this time a female called T-X (Kristanna Loken) who arrives naked in a Rodeo Drive store window and goes on a murderous rampage. She has come from the future looking to kill John Connor (Nick Stahl) a young man who if he lives will lead mankind to victory over the machines. The hand-me-down story line should have been a warning but the beginning of ""Terminator 3"" is so reminiscent of good times at the movies that its hard to be critical. The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) also arrives on Earth naked and walks into a roadside bar looking to steal the clothes off of someones back. In the bar it just happens to be Ladies Night and the drunken women react to him as though he were a male stripper. The joke is as old as Schwarzeneggers career but it has aged well Place him in a raucous embarrassing situation and have him react with complete impassiveness. Schwarzenegger himself has aged well. At 55 he has the body of a . . . never mind nobody else old or young has a body like that. More to the point he looks the same as he did when he won the Mr. Olympia title in the 1970s. He is the Jack LaLanne of American movies. In ""T-2"" John Connor the future hope of mankind was a boy. Now hes a young man ""living off the grid"" as a drifter and a laborer with no credit card or fixed address. He never knows who might drop in from the future looking for him. A catastrophe at an all-night veterinary hospital throws Connor together with a young woman Kate (Claire Danes). T-X shows up and so does Terminator and what follows is a genuinely exciting sequence a battle between the two cyborgs playing out over the streets and highways of Los Angeles as night turns into day. From there it seems as if ""Terminator 3"" can only grow and intensify but its precisely at that point that the movies scale begins to contract. It becomes a small movie about the two cyborgs and the two humans John and Kate. Alas neither of the humans is nearly as colorful as Linda Hamilton in the first two installments. Off screen her role was eliminated the one character that might have lent some spark. The rest of ""T-3"" is just going through the motions. A set-piece fight between T-X and Terminator in a mens room feels like precisely that a set- piece. And the movies effort to evoke laughs by trading on previous ""Terminators"" -- ""Shell be back"" -- only emphasizes the dearth of inspiration. A movie about an effort to save the world from annihilation would seem to demand the epic treatment. But the world remains at a remove uninvolved in its own fate. The movie does provide an opportunity for Schwarzenegger to do some acting when the Terminator dealing with two distinctly different sets of commands is tortured by inner conflict. The best one can say about Schwarzeneggers acting at that moment is that maybe just maybe its supposed to be funny. If not he might want to rethink the possible political career. In politics a candidate has to fool at least 50 percent of the people into thinking hes feeling something. In ""Terminator 3"" Schwarzenegger couldnt fool anybody.

"CNN.com - Review Terminator 3 worth the wait - Jul. 2 2003 The Web CNN.com Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Overview | Gallery | Quiz Review Terminator 3 worth the wait New tale builds on previous films By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer ""Ill be back"" he said and so he is Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines."" Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive (CNN) -- ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" is darker and slicker than its predecessors 1984s ""The Terminator"" and 1991s ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" both directed and co-written by James Cameron. It also contains hundreds if not thousands more computer-generated images than either of those movies. However unlike some other high-tech flicks the effects dont completely overpower the plot or take the audience totally out of the story -- at least most of the time. John Connor played this time by Nick Stahl (best known for his role opposite Marisa Tomei in 2001s Oscar-nominated ""In the Bedroom"") is now 22 years old and living ""off the grid."" He has no home phone job or credit cards. There is no record of his existence. But Skynet the evil computer system that created the Terminators in the first two movies is still in place and still looking for him. Judgment Day still looms ... though its been pushed back a bit. (In the first two movies humanity was supposed to have been nearly wiped out in 1997. We obviously survived that -- but 2029 the Year of Darkness in which Skynet created the first Terminator is still to come.) A job to do Kristanna Loken plays the T-X the latest Terminator to come after John Connor. Out of the future comes T-X the most relentless -- and babe-a-licious -- killing machine ever made played by newcomer Kristanna Loken. Shes come back to finish the job her cyborg predecessors had left uncompleted in the first two installments of the saga. But this time she has more than Connor on her cyborg ""to do"" list. T-Xs secondary target is veterinarian Kate Brewster played by Claire Danes. Unbeknownst to them Kate and John are connected in the future and both must survive to save the world from being taken over by machines. The T-101 a replica of the original Terminator -- once again played by Schwarzenegger -- comes back to protect them from the new sophisticated T-X. The only thing standing between the machines and the fall of civilization as we know it is the iconic Terminator complete with leather jacket leather boots and dark sunglasses. The fast-paced script by John Brancato Michael Ferris and Tedi Sarafian advances the story well and increases the tension and emotions. Theyve also infused the story with wit and Schwarzenegger seems to be having fun kidding around with his Terminator image. More bells and whistles Claire Danes and Nick Stahl in ""T3."" With the first two films Cameron not only redefined what a science fiction/action movie looked like he practically invented a new genre. ""T3"" director Jonathan Mostow had many more bells and whistles to play with than Cameron did but he hasnt let the technology stop him from putting his own mark on the project. Mostow obviously is a fan of the franchise. He doesnt offer as many surprises in this film and hes a bit heavy-handed and over-the-top in a couple of scenes such as a chase scene in downtown Los Angeles involving a fire truck that goes on and on. But he does infuse the story with emotional weight and the relationship between young Connor and Kate builds beautifully. The climax is also stunning and thought-provoking while screaming sequel at the same time. The basic premise of the Terminator franchise can still thrill audiences. As a society we are fascinated with machines especially robots and time travel has always been a crowd pleaser. When you can use both to alter the future its a bonus. At the age of 56 Schwarzenegger is able to pull off the character he first played almost 20 years ago including the now-standard nude scene in which he returns from the future. Loken is a wonderful addition and both Stahl and Danes are excellent as two young people stunned by events out of their control. ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" is a wonderful third installment. Some purists and major cult fans of the first two films may miss Camerons directing style but ""Machines"" has a much better script than the first two. However if anybody wants a fourth film theyd better get going. Arnie may be hitting a campaign trail instead of bad guys very soon. ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" opens nationwide on Wednesday July 2 and is rated R.

A hard-hitting straight-ahead sci-fi actioner with none of the pretentions and ponderousness that have put at least a portion of the public off of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Hulk"" this long-awaited return of Arnold Schwarzeneggers most famous character serves up nothing more and crucially nothing less than it intends to. ""T3"" delivers the goods. A hard-hitting straight-ahead sci-fi actioner with none of the pretentions and ponderousness that have put at least a portion of the public off of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Hulk"" this long-awaited return of Arnold Schwarzeneggers most famous character serves up nothing more and crucially nothing less than it intends to. Despite its 175 million-plus budget and the strong reputations of James Camerons first two entries in the series pic arrives in the marketplace with considerably less expectational baggage than some of the seasons other highly hyped sequels and would-be blockbusters which can only work to its benefit in terms of audience satisfaction. Global B.O. should easily justify the financial expenditure protracted development and risky decision to move ahead without Cameron. Many concerns have dogged ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" Could 55-year-old political aspirant Schwarzenegger still climb into his black leather Terminator duds? Could the new film measure up to other special effects epics that have eclipsed it in the interim? Could Jonathan Mostow even begin to fill Camerons shoes? Would audiences still care about the franchise 12 years after the spectacular ""T2""? The answer to the first question is yes and the way pic establishes the requisite scope technique and tone within the first few minutes suggests a resounding yes to the other questions as well. The film maintains a balance between urgent drama and eye-popping violence delivered by a sensibility happily more inclined to classical action aesthetics than to fashionable effects for effects sake. Script by John Brancato and Michael Ferris who penned ""The Game"" for Mostow before the director was removed from the project very smoothly picks up the story thread from ""T2"" in which young teenager John Connor was instrumental in forestalling Judgment Day when Skynets machines were meant to wipe out humankind. Summing up action from the first two pictures Connor (now played in his early 20s by Nick Stahl rather than by ""T2s"" Edward Furlong) notes how the mechanized forces of evil tried to kill him twice once before he was born and again at age 13. As a result the grunge boy now lives ""off the grid"" where ""no one and nothing can find me"" although he does admit he feels ""the weight of the future bearing down on me."" Connors status as the chosen One who will save humanity from an ultra-powerful system bent on replacing it naturally calls ""The Matrix"" to mind. But theres little mystery ambiguity or intellectual posturing to the ""Terminator"" series which sets it apart from other pictures this summer. This is strictly bad girl chasing good guys and girl for the better part of two hours and doing it on a very large scale indeed. Bad girl in question makes quite an entrance. ""Born"" in a BevHills boutique window the statuesque blonde strides nude across Rodeo Drive at night announces to a woman that she likes her sports car and races off in it. She appropriates a cops gun in similar fashion. This brazen being its soon revealed is T-X (Kristanna Loken) the most technologically advanced and certainly best looking cyborg assassin ever unleashed upon the world. Also arriving in the buff is a dead ringer for the original model Terminator (Schwarzenegger) who walks out of the desert and straight into a honky tonk on ladies night where he avails himself of the male strippers black Terminator uniform. Although amusing more could have been made of this sequence but then ""Terminator 3"" is not a film that pauses for incidentals. T-X has been deposited on Earth with the mission of tracking down and killing Connor thus paving the way for the machines takeover. That path goes through a young vet and former school classmate of Connors Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) whose three-star general father (David Andrews) is in charge of maintaining U.S. security against the machines threat. Killing innocent bystanders as she goes T-X quickly closes in on Connor who has sought refuge at the unsuspecting Kates clinic and is foiled only when the Terminator steps in for the first of several duels with her. Although its Connors survival that matters above all the battles between the Terminator and T-X are the pictures meat and potatoes. In the same way that sci-fi/fantasy aficionados relished Robert Patricks T-1000 in ""T2"" series fans will delight in the ways in which the new models superiority to Schwarzeneggers ""obsolete"" T-101 are detailed Like the T-1000 her humanoid liquid metal exterior can quickly recover from damage or morph to take on anothers appearance and a prosthetic arm can instantly transform into a multi-purpose weapon. But the T-X also has an ultra-sophisticated computerized brain and internal tracking system. Shes the strongest cyborg yet made and in an amusing early gambit she is able to pick up the trail of the otherwise untraceable Connor by tasting his blood. ""T3"" shows its true scale a half-hour in with a chase involving the cops Connor and Kate in a truck the Terminator on a motorcycle and T-X at the wheel of a 100-ton crane. At one point the Terminator is snared on the hook at cranes end and slammed into a succession of buildings as the enormous vehicle barrels through an industrial neighborhood. The extent of destruction is staggering and looks entirely real as does the final upending of the crane that as the press notes reveal was accomplished with some CGI assistance. Anyone craving big-time screen action will get it in this sequence. Worked into the relative downtime are Connors struggles over the notion of being the Resistance leader a status underlined by the Terminator when he declares that ""Judgment Day is inevitable."" Connor and Kate have to come to terms with some mildly unsettling past relations and are taken to the grave of Connors mother before learning they have precisely three hours to try to save the world before the predicted nuclear war. Theres nothing like a ticking clock attached to the planets fate to set a film like this into high gear. While Kates dad nervously engages military means to try to thwart doomsday only the Terminator really has any kind of chance against T-X who keeps coming back again and again and engages her antiquated rival in an extended gladiatorial mano a mano that kicks gratifying butt. Actual ending is sobering in a way that has been seen numerous times before but is nonetheless one that every generation can use seeing. It also leaves the door open to yet another series installment should the stars political career go awry. After several less than memorable appearances in lackluster vehicles it really is good to see Schwarzenegger back in form in one of his trademark roles. He looks great (allegedly he fit right into the same costume he wore the first time around 19 years ago) delivers his retorts with the same economical authority he did before and in no way seems like a aging action star desperately striving for one last shot at glory. More than in ""T2"" the current Terminators physical inferiority to his opponent invests Schwarzenegger with an unaccustomed underdog status that brings him closer to the viewer. Newcomer Loken proves a worthy adversary and the effectiveness of the young thesps perfect features is augmented by her relentless physicality and subtly artificial movements that sometimes make her head resemble a swiveling surveillance camera. A last-minute substitution for another actress and an initially surprising presence in this sort of fare Danes brings grit and intelligence to the role of a young woman thrust into an uncommonly challenging situation. Stahl wrestles manfully with the existential dilemma of his character but remains a bit too much the average disaffected youth. To make Connor into a memorable role the actor would probably have needed to identify something special inside the character that he isnt even aware of himself but its not visible in this reading. The outstanding Terminator get-up and animatronic effects by Stan Winston and special visual effects and animation by Industrial Light amp; Magic will decidedly give any audience its moneys worth. At the same time the series origins in the relatively low-budget sci-fi arena can still be seen in the pictures dark look and compared with the likes of the ""Matrix"" and ""X-Men"" franchises mundane contempo settings. Despite all the effects pics style is not determined by them. Other craft contributions are sturdily professional rather than slick and action is ably supported by a Marco Beltrami score that is unobtrusive by current standards.

"Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; terminator-3-rise-of-the-machines ) Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Terminator 3 is the summer movie of 2003 that hard-core action fans have been awaiting. Its not ponderous and incomplete like The Matrix Reloaded. Its not steeped in characterization and modern-day mythology like Hulk. And its not vapid and flashy like Charlies Angels Full Throttle and Bad Boys 2. Instead its a relatively straightforward science fiction adventure film - just what movie-goers expect from a third outing with Arnold Schwarzeneggers cybernetic alter-ego. The movie is not weighted down by plot but it does have a recognizable storyline featuring legitimate characters and a few nice (but minor) twists. Some degree of attention is helpful - Terminator 3 is not an intellectual challenge but neither is it vacuous. The film has plenty of action sequences some of which are spectacular. Director Jonathan Mostow has wisely not relied too much on computer graphics for these. A fair amount of stunt work was required and the computer components are incorporated seamlessly. Additionally Mostow does not play the game of cutting every second or so and the music never upstages the visuals. Terminator 3 gets the most bang for its buck by letting the camera linger on the spectacle and allowing tension not flashiness to be its hallmark. Its 10 years after Terminator 2 Judgment Day and in the decade since we last entered this universe Sarah Connor has died of leukemia and her son John (Nick Stahl) has become a recluse. Even though he and his mother supposedly averted the nuclear war that would devastate the planet and allow the machines to take over a part of him doubts that the future is secure. That uncertainty bears fruit when an unstoppable Termanatrix the T-X (Kristanna Loken) enters the early 21st century on a mission to kill John and one of his lieutenants Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). Following the T-X through the portal is the reliable obsolete T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) sent to protect John and Kate. Eventually the human targets end up on the run from the T-X. Their goal is the same as it was in Terminator 2 avert a nuclear catastrophe. But this time the odds are even more heavily stacked against them and time is not on their side. If you take a step back and examine Terminator 3 from a distance it bears all the characteristics of a road movie. Strip away the action sequences and the science fiction/time travel veneer and thats whats left. But since the average road movie is terminally boring Mostow provides plenty of pyrotechnics along the way. Terminator 3 is a closer cousin to Terminator 2 than it is to the original. Like the first sequel this movie is more concerned with elevating the pulse than stimulating the mind. There was plenty of action in The Terminator but that movie was founded on ideas and paradoxes. In Terminator 2 and Terminator 3 the thought-provoking skeleton is still in place but a much greater importance has been placed on the visceral impact. Arnold Schwarzenegger effortlessly slides into the role that made him a superstar. Depending on where his political aspirations take him this could either be a comeback or farewell. Either way this performance reminds us why for all of his acting limitations no one was a bigger action star during the 80s (not even Stallone). Schwarzenegger has charisma and screen presence. Watching him here its hard to believe that hes in his 50s. And after several duds (the most recent of which was Collateral Damage) its nice to see him finally back in form. Kristanna Loken plays Terminator 3s version of Robert Patricks Terminator 2 villain with a few new enhancements added. Like Patrick Loken brings an icy cool to the part. The difference is of course that Loken has a lot more sex appeal than Patrick. Nick Stahl replaces Edward Furlong as John Connor. Stahl is a capable actor (note his work in In the Bedroom) and more than able to make us sympathetic to Johns plight. Claire Danes provides the female muscle power (essentially replacing Linda Hamilton) while injecting a little romance Terminator 3 has a number of impressive action sequences including one that features two crashing helicopters and another in which the T-101 and T-X go at it one-on-one. But none is more impressive than the crane chase where the worlds largest crane goes crashing through everything in its path in an out-of-control attempt to (literally) run down John and Kate. (When Warner Brothers became skittish about budgetary issues Schwarzenegger chipped in 1.6 million to allow the sequence to be finished.) Its hard to say which is the summers best chase this one or the equally spectacular one in The Matrix Reloaded. Will there be a Terminator 4? The ending allows for one and parts of the story have yet to be told. But from an action standpoint is there any way that way that a fourth picture could be anything other than a re-hash of its predecessors? And can the franchise succeed without its star (who barring a failure to gain political office will not be interested)? Those are questions for the future. However considering how well Terminator 3 is likely to fare at the box office the future wont be that far away. It has taken a long time to get Terminator 3 to the screen and while the production doesnt rock the action motion picture industry to its foundation its a credible and entertaining movie and was worth the wait.
