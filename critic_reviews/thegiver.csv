"Small(er) Movies Roundup Frank The Giver and More << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movies Roundup Frank The Giver and More Movies August 19 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Because not even the worst movie here is worse than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Expendables 3. The Hundred-Foot Journey directed by Lasse Hallstrom Just appalling. A family of Mumbai asylum seekers settle in a French village. They open their funky soul-food restaurant right across the road from the snootiest joint in all the land. Om Puri runs the Indian place. Helen Mirren is his clenched Gallic rival. If the movie has to exist at all it ought to be a duel between these two actors -- her soupy accent versus his root vegetable of a nose. It is instead a tale of assimilation in which the talents of the old Indians son (Manish Dayal) become too much for the old Frenchy to resist. She must have him in her kitchen and inculcate him with the sort of national culinary traditions that will land him fame in Paris where a kind of Iron Chef-Modernist Cuisine hell awaits (the dust the foam the facial stubble). Theres a way in which the movies can make progress seem totally backward. The young man is all too happy to oblige having already won the local lovely (Charlotte Le Bon) who wears perfectly tailored floral-print dresses and rides the sort of cute basketed bike that non-French movies always put French women on. Of course she works in Madame Mirrens kitchen where her envy over her bosss preference for her new pal temporarily compromises their relationship. Hallstroms confusion of tastelessness with tastefulness strikes again. (Perhaps youve seen Chocolat or The Cider House Rules or Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.) Another instance comes in the idea that what boring-old French cooking needs is lots and lots of spices. But my favorite is the scene in which a shot of the Indians kitchen-wise matriarch burning alive in a politically ignited fire promptly gives way to a shot of sizzling shellfish. If the movie is high on gastronomy it also redefines cooking with gas. Mood Indigo directed by Michel Gondry How is it possible that weve given up on Gondry already? Is one bad blockbuster (2011s Green Hornet) all it takes? His last two films -- the dreamed-realist docudrama The We and the I and the realist-dreamed docu-toon Is the Man Who Is Tall Happy? -- came and went in the U.S. and the same fate appears to await this new movie a romantic dramedy. Its a crime. The first hour might be the loveliest youll see all year. Romain Duris and Audrey Tautou meet at a party. They dance fall in love get married and live happily until she gets sick. Sounds ordinary but this is the same man who made both literal and surreal Jim Carreys melancholy for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. He invented the civil agreement for moviegoing as community organization in Be Kind Rewind. He put a lot of Kylie Minogues on an ever-looping city block for her ""Come Into My World"" video. Here formal ingenuity and production design come at you so fast that to watch it is to be Lucy and Ethel at the chocolate factory stuffing candy into your pockets and inside your bra and down your throat. Duris and Tautou leap from his loft bed in pajamas and land on the floor fully dressed for the day. When Charlotte Le Bon (far better used than in The Hundred-Foot Journey) gets a load of Duriss friend and amanuensis (Omar Sy) she drops the tray she is holding and the camera cuts to her feet slipping on it cartoon-style until shes got the momentum to sail in his direction and attack him with kisses. But all the blisses of this movie wipe you out. The first hour is so happily innovative with its Richard Lester zip and the last half-hour so forlorn (the Jean-Paul Sartre sight gags arent a joke). Gondry has such an incomparable understanding of the way in which strange and unexpected sights can tickle you. What he sometimes lacks as a filmmaker is the awareness that he can tickle an audience to death. Magic in the Moonlight directed by Woody Allen Its possible Allen has solved the Emma Stone problem. It was pretty simple Hire her. Here shes Sophie Baker an American psychic residing among rich Yankees in late-1920s southern France. Is she a four-star clairvoyant or a two-bit gold digger? Who better to crack the case than the esteemed if conceited Orientalist stage magician Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth)? What happens here needs no clairvoyance. Firth is not as 25 as Stone is so theyre a match. But the movies opening hour has a fascinating balance of nonsense and depth. The buttery haze of Darius Khondjis photography goes nicely with Allens attempt to conflate Nietzsches human distrust and F. Scott Fitzgeralds class ladders with poetic writing. The more Sophie appears to be the real deal the deeper into spiritual doubt Stanleys arrogance sinks. If only Allen could keep that introspection and frippery going. Eileen Atkins Jacki Weaver Marcia Gay Harden and an elegantly spent Simon McBurney do fine work. And Stone doesnt overdo anything -- shes daffy and cunning. You dont know whether shes running a con. Actually yes you do. You just dont care. But the movie runs out of ideas for her character. Sophie and Stanley appear to be in a belief-oriented arm-wrestling match that you want her to win. But her character gets dumber and dumber the further from her gift she gets. If Allen thinks he has transferred that magic to the embarrassing last scene then he should be the object of Stanleys next debunking. The Giver directed by Phillip Noyce One risk of these dystopia series is that they start to run together. Lois Lowrys Giver novels the first of which showed up in 1993 are a recent forerunner of series like The Hunger Games and the delusionally self-defensively titled Divergent. But this adaptation arrives after those and sleepwalks in their shadow. Its hard to care that its special-chosen-gifted nonconformist hero Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) wants to restore painful memories to a utopia from which such truths have been erased. Thwaites and the kids playing his fellow classmates are like live-action Kohls catalogue models. Meryl Streep does some half-chilling insinuation as the head elder. Jeff Bridges in the venerated title role mumbles through another part. (Hes like a car radiator that needs water.) And the brief appearance of Taylor Swift is like an answer to clues in a game of charades blonde? Hallucinated? Plasmatic? Piano? The films been shot in dreary black-and-white. The primary mode of communication is ritualized passive-aggressiveness (""Thank you for childhood"" young graduates are told; and the mantra ""We accept your apology"" comes to sound like ""Up yours""). And the color montages of those erased memories feature all the brown people who arent actually part of the narrative. This might be an anti-pharmaceutical anti-cult (Katie Holmes aptly drones along as Jonass mom) anti-plot anti-suspense allegory. It could also just be Thanksgiving at your robot-zombie in-laws. Into the Storm directed by Steven Quale Ill say this for humanity. Its still strong enough that when this lazily conceived lousily acted painfully dumb movie gives you the option to root either for the computer-generated tornadoes or for the people exploiting them for fame and cash Ill still choose the people. But its not an easy choice. What weve got here is somewhere between Twister and one of those storm-chaser reality shows except Jan de Bont made Twister. That man knew how to make a comic-suspenseful set piece -- and Helen Hunt Bill Paxton and Philip Seymour Hoffman knew how to act. This movie uses that found-footage device in which none of the characters can ever put the camera down especially when running for his life. Even the brand-new Oklahoma high school lovebirds keep theirs running while the building theyre trapped in turns them into the kids from Titanic. Occasionally the gimmick vanishes and you have to wonder whos doing the camerawork and who has supplied the pseudo military-video-game home-screen music. Youre asked to wonder a lot actually. Why is saving the day the job of the vice-principal (Richard Armitage) and not the Obama-eared Updike-quoting hardheaded principal-principal? (No answer required.) And is the movie really gonna start a thing between the vice-principal and the guilty single-mother meteorologist (Sarah Wayne Callies)? Oh my god it is (Its preposterous to have Armitage wear his suit this wet and this tight if he wont rip it off and start catching falling barns.) The one beautiful image is of Veeps Matt Walsh defanged of comedy and his armored vehicle as its sucked into the eye of the storm. Then you remember theres only one direction left for him to go in and that even though hes playing the biggest asshole and most selfish moron its the wrong one. But barely. The Dog directed by Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren Theres a brashness to this documentary that sneaks up on you. In recounting the life of John Wojtowicz the Brooklyn guy whose all-day all-night 1972 bank robbery was the basis for Sidney Lumets Dog Day Afternoon the film gets personalities of a New York vintage that have gone out of style. Wojtowicz who died in 2006 is as they say a character. But so are the woman and men he married. So is his mother. Old and flabby and gray when the filmmakers find him he loves their attention. And they indulge him letting him surf jovial tirades about how he was a ""chauvinistic pig"" and ""the boss"" and a real ""motherfucker"" and the ""gay Babe Ruth."" But the movie always has its eye on a bigger story of sex and sexuality never losing the thread of Wojtowiczs megalomania narcissism and libidinousness. The robbery was for money to fund a sex reassignment surgery for Wojtowiczs wife Elizabeth Eden. But the marriage seemed doomed during the wedding when Wojtowicz tried to make out with everyone in sight. Berg and Keraudren have done reporting and research. Theyve found archival video and audio footage as good as Lumets film and in some instances far more illuminating. They tell the story of mental illness sexual politics homophobia and personal profit. Even with the social legal and political advances of the past 40 or so years what blew minds about and drew crowds to Wojtowiczs particularly yet peculiarly American story in the 1970s only seems slightly less bizarre now. A Will for the Woods directed by Amy Browne Tony Hale Jeremy Kaplan and Brian Wilson Another documentary that ends with a plea to visit a website -- in this case to find out more about so-called green burial. You roll your eyes only because the movie itself opens into an eloquent enough sales pitch on behalf of its primary human subject Clark Wang. Wang is a North Carolina musician and psychiatrist who has terminal cancer. Upon his death hed like to be buried au naturel -- no preservatives no fancy coffin. A wood box in the dirt will do. The movie feels entirely promotional provoking separate unanswered questions about green medicine too. Natural burials supporters want a normal process of decay in which the body enters the earth chemical-free. But Wang fights for his life and that requires lots of machines and treatments and cross-country driving. Im sure theres a rationale the natural-burial people could articulate but the filmmakers arent journalists enough to ask. They do have a sense of serenity and in Wang a persuasive movingly all-too-human case for the cause. Why bother with a URL when youve got this? Jealousy directed by Philippe Garrel Theres only one way to run in Garrels movies passionately. I mean that physically -- at some point Anna Mouglalis abruptly bursts out of a cafe and barrels down the street. Who at first can say why? Its an instinct. But the running is true emotionally too. The characters in Garrels umpteenth romantic drama run passionately but theyre cool. Mouglalis plays an actress who hasnt worked in years. She does odd jobs when she does anything at all. Her relationship with another actor (Garrels son Louis) seems to satisfy and exasperate her at the same time. But despite a dalliance with a cast mate he finds the idea of life without her impossible. The films 77 minutes shot in an autumnal woolly Bergmanesque black-and-white watch them do nothing much -- alone together or her with friends or him with his young daughter and other actors. Theres a casualness at work here thats absorbing because Garrel doesnt make a moment mean more than it ought to. So much of being in a relationship is spent in idleness on standby being slumped over the other person ostensibly doing nothing but being bound. For Garrels character that bond is sustenance (few actors are as all in as Garrell can be). For Mouglaliss the bond is something to toy with. Hers is the voice of a woman whose first words were ""Do you have a light?"" Here Mouglalis moves so casually from blase to neurotic that you question her employment status. She hasnt worked in so long because she has turned love into theater. Dinosaur 13 directed by Todd Douglas Miller In 1990 a group of American paleontologists discovered Sue the most complete T. rex fossil ever. They just happened to do so on land whose ownership was in dispute. This documentary works hard to be a custody drama among the scientists the federal government and an old South Dakota rancher with a complicated legal claim to what turns out to be Sioux land. It gets most of the way there. The story itself is so strange and the case so baffling. Theres no filmmaking to speak of just a collection of talking heads not enough of which belong to the government or the rancher. The storytelling raises more logistical and legal questions than its equipped to answer. But what Miller does have for anyone unfamiliar with Sues fate is a story with a suspenseful climax and at the very least a determination to tell it decently enough to leave the audience happy for the dinosaur and sad for the men and women who dug her up. Frank directed by Lenny Abrahamson Magnolia Pictures The reason rock dramas are usually so bad is that they dont know where in the band to find the story. Is it with the musicians the creation of the songs their performance? Very few movies supply the answer. Instead they give you poses and tics. This tedious movie does that as well. Domhnall Gleason winds up in a band with Maggie Gyllenhaal Scoot McNairy and Michael Fassbender who as Frank spends the movie in a disproportionally large papier-mache head presenting an aggravating affront to the sport of losing oneself in Fassbenders face. Its based on the story of the comic and musician Chris Sievey who spent some of his career in a similar head as Frank Sidebottom. Things go from cutesy to clever to grim from the bands country shack to the road and it takes too long to get everywhere. The songs meanwhile are knowing nonsense but they dont point to any larger idea about nonsense songs making you wonder if the band really knows. Theyre what in Infinite Jest would be called apres-garde. And it doesnt feel good to watch actors this good look this lost. All the irritation in Gyllenhaals performance and the boyish bafflement in McNairys appear to arise from the possibility that none of the actors -- except Fassbender who by the films insultingly cheap last act is in a totally different movie -- knows what theyre doing. Its as if the director is made of papier-mache too.

Which isnt the only melancholic thing about the film Watch a clip from the film ""The Giver"" starring Brenton Thwaites Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep. Photo/Video The Weinstein Company By John Anderson Aug. 14 2014 244 p.m. ET 1 COMMENTS A little late to the dystopia party ""The Giver"" directed by Phillip Noyce and adapted from the celebrated 1993 childrens book by Lois Lowry has taken almost two decades to reach the screen. The rights were purchased early on by actor Jeff Bridges with the intention of having his father Lloyd play the wise man of the title. Mr. Bridges himself is now playing the role. Which isnt the only melancholic thing about the film. Its almost unheard of these days find a movie in general release that was shot (mostly) in widescreen black-and-white. But thats how people see in Ms. Lowrys faux-Utopia a community where ""our leaders have eliminated everything that would create conflict."" This includes color. And apparently parked cars In an early scene the hero Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is bicycling along so blissfully peering up at the sky ruminating about what life has in store that you want to yell ""look out."" More Reviews Frank Dinosaur 13 It would be good advice. Jonas older in the film than in the book is headed for the ceremonial Release to Elsewhere an annual ritual at which the grown children of the heavily medicated community are given their life assignments by the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) who arrives by hologram. This for Jonas means becoming the Receiver of Memory the human repository of his peoples history. He will learn all he is to learn from The Giver (Mr. Bridges) his predecessor in the post and what Jonas learns will change him and his community forever. ENLARGE Meryl Street and Jeff Bridges in The Giver Weinstein Co. There are innumerable lapses in logic. And the tension in the film is less about bicycles than Mr. Noyces attempt to make ""The Giver"" into the kind of thriller hes made before (""Patriot Games"" for instance or ""The Quiet American""). This despite the purposefully benign atmosphere that hangs over Ms. Lowrys universe which is built on the ""virtue"" of Sameness and walks a fine line between being dystopic and desirable Whats so unfunny about peace love and understanding? Plenty it turns out. But for much of the movie viewers will be asking themselves where the conflict is. And by extension the drama. Rewind DVD //Streaming //Download ENLARGE Lost Horizon (1937) Peace and serenity get a much better rap in Frank Capras adaption of the 1933 James Hilton novel about a U.S. diplomat (Ronald Colman) and the planeload of people hes rescued from war-torn China who have crashed into a Himalayan community where no one grows old ill or intemperate. Although Shangri-La became synonymous with contentment Columbia Pictures was dyspeptic over the Capra adventure. It was already the most expensive film ever approved by studio chief Harry Cohn when it went nearly a million dollars over budget plagued both by technical problems and its directors inability to cut it to a serviceable length. Still it remains one of the much-honored filmmakers signature movies. 10 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

(Author Lois Lowry published her novel in 1993 which makes it officially the cool aunt of Katniss and the kids.) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The story picks up several generations after humanity has done something so awful that our descendants have wiped it from memory. Theyve forcibly forgotten a lot of other things too how to kiss how to clap and how to lie. Their climate-controlled mesa eliminated disruptions such as weather and animals so long ago that a stuffed toy elephant is mistakenly thought to be a mythical hippo a speedy beast with five legs. To keep the peace everyones mood is medicated in the morning. Sure theyve sacrificed the ability to see color -- the better to eradicate racism -- but at least theres no fear no hate no envy no violence and no risk. In short its a helicopter parents utopia. Teenagers of course would hate it if they were missing out on dancing and lust. But only one Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is learning what theyve lost. Hes been appointed the Keeper of Memories -- the sage who uses the mistakes of the past to advise the leaders of the present -- and his trainer the outgoing Keeper (Jeff Bridges) is charged with filling him in on the good and bad of what mankind has lost crowd-surfing and Tiananmen Square and polar bears and Nelson Mandela raising a fist.Film Details The Giver RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time91 min. More Info Trailer Director Phillip Noyce (Patriot Games) leans heavily on montages that cut to Jonas startled and heavy with the weight of what hes just learned and as he furtively cuts back on his meds the film slowly saturates from black-and-white to pale pastels to the full rich rainbow of life including the auburn hair that graces the childhood friend (Odeya Rush) he now realizes he loves. (A word his caretaker played by Katie Holmes sniffs is ""so antiquated it no longer makes sense."")Whats Jonas going to do about his hermetically uncool community? You can probably guess despite the town elders (Meryl Streep) caution that ""when people have the freedom to choose they choose wrong every single time."" But teens and preteens who choose to buy tickets to The Giver an imperfect but straightforward charmer that respects their intelligence could choose much much worse.

And though the movie adaptations of Veronica Roths and Suzanne Collins ultra-popular novels beat the Newbery award-winning novel to the multiplex each seems to taketh from ""The Giver."" Had actor Jeff Bridges had his way ""The Giver"" would have become a movie years ago. He started trying to develop it as a project for father Lloyd in the title role he now plays with a warm weariness. The Giver"" unfolds in the time after ""The Ruin."" Sameness rules the Community a berg of two-story big-windowed sleek box homes. The citizens appear happy in their appointed labors. The usual ""isms"" have been eradicated with a hushed but steady adherence to order and oh yes morning injections. The black-white-gray palette director Phillip Noyce and cinematographer Ross Emery utilize at the start of the film evokes 50s sci-fi thrillers although the films mood is decidedly muted compared with those Cold-War-anxious films. Lowrys book was carefully adapted by Robert Weide and playwright Michael Mitnick. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) and best friends Fiona (Israeli actress Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan of ""Shameless"" ) are set to undergo a ceremony during which they will be assigned their lifelong jobs. Kind-hearted Fiona will head to the nurturing center. Jonas own father (Alexander Skarsgard) is a Nurturer. Asher is selected to become a drone pilot. Hell fly toward the boundary that hems in this utopia that is free of human history liberated from memory. Except in one case. Singled out to become ""Receiver of Memories"" Jonas begins training with Bridges character -- The Giver -- a worn tormented mentor who lives alone in a house full of books. Hell transmit human history with his touch. Jonas receives the miracles but also the miseries of that rush of images sounds feelings. The boldly color-saturated montages that flow into Jonas tend toward the ecstatic more than the horrific though there are some sure to upset younger audience members. And pop star Taylor Swift makes an appearance as a prior Receiver in training. As Jonas Brenton Thwaites brings thoughtful wonder to the role of a young man who is thrilled and frightened by what he learns. He is also curious and ultimately courageous. When a baby his father brought home is scheduled for what the Community calls ""a release to Elsewhere"" Jonas acts. Katie Holmes plays Jonas mother a higher-up in the Department of Justice. ""Precision of language"" she tells her questioning son. The most imprecise word of all? ""Love."" Meryl Streep looks aptly haggard as the Communitys Chief Elder. Its tiring work keeping a utopia running like a well-surveilled machine. To fans of the juggernauts ""The Hunger Games"" and the ""Divergent"" series ""The Giver"" will likely seem tame. Its darkness skews younger. Theres a gentleness that comes with its underlying chill. Its a class act the kind of respectful rendering of a literary source weve come to expect from Philip Anschutzs Walden Media the indie force behind ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" ""Holes."" and other engaging family fare.

Like many people I loved the book. You summed up the movies shortcomings perfectly. It was just lost in translation. You mentioned the moments where The Giver shared visions of the past with Jonas as particularly underwhelming. I agree totally. I wonder how the movie would have turned out in the hands of a different director. Imagine if it was directed by Danny Boyle or Alfonso Cuaron (or even Stanley Kubrick rest in peace). I think given the source material it could have been great. Andrew Lopezsaid on Friday September 26 2014 125323 PMI saw this movie with my wife. We loved this movie both as a commentary on how our present society is turning cold but also for the human struggles (or lack thereof) of the characters. There were two glaring weaknesses. The voice over narration made the movie feel anticlimatic diminishing its dramatic effect and from a science fiction standpoint never explaining how the main characters crossing of the border could have such a profound impact on society. Take away these two flaws and you have a 1/2 movie. Jerry Carlson jrsaid on Thursday August 21 2014 10514 AMHavent seen it.

"Giver The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; giver-the ) Giver The (United States 2014) August 15 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Since Jeff Bridges optioned the rights to Lois Lowrys The Giver shortly after its 1993 publication the tale has been on a slow track to production. Bridges however didnt give up and although his original choice for the title character passed away (his father Lloyd) and funding was difficult to come by Bridges intention to get The Giver made never evaporated. The rise in popularity of YA products like The Hunger Games and Divergent (both of which owe plot elements to The Giver) greatly improved the films prospects of getting made. So two decades after initially pitching the idea Bridges vision has reached the screen with several high-profile supporting performers in the cast. Despite a number of changes necessary to make the story more cinematic The Giver is largely faithful to its source material. The PG-13 rating however indicates that some aspects of the movie are deemed more mature than is the norm for a ""childrens book."" (The Giver won the 1994 Newberry Medal.) The PG-13 is likely the result of one specific scene that is potentially more upsetting on screen than in writing due to the concrete nature of the visual representation. Theres no mystery in the book about whats happening but seeing it is different from imagining it. The allegorical and metaphorical aspects of various plot elements means there are ""suspension of disbelief"" hurdles to be cleared. A literal reading of the screenplay reveals logical issues that no amount of convoluted explaining can patch over. The films strengths however more than compensate. This is a thoughtful motion picture with strong acting a powerful visual approach and well-developed themes. Like the book it highlights the importance of emotions to a full rich life. In the Captain Kirk vs. Mr. Spock debate theres little doubt Lois Lowry would side with the Captain even though her text acknowledges the horrors and pain that accompany the embrace of deep feelings. The dystopian future presented in The Giver will look familiar to those who have explored (either through reading or watching) recent futuristic YA stories. Because The Giver was published before them any temptation to accuse this of ""copying"" should be struck down. If it was influenced by any previous material a more likely staring point might be Fahrenheit 451 with which it shares certain narrative and thematic likenesses. As the movie opens we are introduced to a trio of best friends Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) Fiona (Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan). A voiceover provides us with details of their society and sets up the situation. Fort these childhood companions adult life beckons. They are about to be assigned the functions that will define their adult lives. The ceremony is a grand occasion presided over by a hologram of the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep). Jonas is selected to become the communitys new ""Receiver"" - a position of great importance that will allow him to be the repository of all the historical memories forbidden to the average citizen. Ascension to this position requires him to learn under the stewardship of the ""Giver"" (Jeff Bridges) whose lessons are in part practical and in part philosophical. As Jonas knowledge of the past blossoms he comes to doubt the wisdom of the Elders and wants Fiona his first love to realize what he has uncovered about how emotions enrich life - a discovery rejected by the First Elder his mother (Katie Holmes) and his father (Alexander Skarsgard). The strength of the cast speaks volumes about the ""prestige"" aspect of the production. In addition to Bridges Meryl Streep Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgard contribute. The leads however are left to younger more fresh-faced performers. The 12-year olds from the book have been aged (as was the case in Enders Game) to somewhere in the 16-to-18-year old range. This allows up-and-coming actor Brenton Thwaites (recently seen in a trio of films The Signal Oculus and Maleficent) to essay Jonas. TV veteran Cameron Monaghan plays Asher and relative newcomer Odeya Rush gives Fiona spirit and appeal. In many ways the actors play second fiddle to The Givers look. Color is the most important tool used by director Phillip Noyce and cinematographer Ross Emery. When depicting a world in which emotion has been banned things are black-and-white. As Jonas begins to discover the past desaturated hues creep in. When we see the memories through Jonas eyes the colors are hyper-realized bright and unrealistically strong. Not since Pleasantville has color (and the lack thereof) been this important to a motion picture. By retaining the ambiguity of the books ending Noyce opens a question about whether the resolution which works effectively in print is the best way to conclude a movie. There are certainly questions left unanswered or half-answered. The film as a whole however should satisfy those who have read the book (unless their expectations are for a slavishly accurate translation) and provide fodder for thought and rumination. In the ranks of dystopian YA-targeted motion pictures this one can stand alongside its peers.

By Peter Rainer Film critic August 15 2014 Save for later Saved The Giver stars Jeff Bridges (l.) and Brenton Thwaites (r.). The Weinstein Company/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The latest entrant in the YA franchise film sweepstakes ""The Giver"" is based on Lois Lowrys 1993 Newbery Medal-winning novel and is a longtime pet project of its costar Jeff Bridges. The trouble with pet projects is that too often they are unduly do-goody and so it is here.The story is set in a futuristic faux utopia in which people live out their lives in an enforced sameness devoid of true feeling starting from the cradle and abetted by passion-sapping drugs. For their own peace of mind supposedly they retain no knowledge of their own history. Only The Giver (Bridges) is entrusted with mankinds back story just in case the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) needs some extracurricular counsel. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) has been chosen to be the inheritor of the Givers lore and in various mind-meld scenes resembling a mash-up of CNN Headline News and ""Koyaanisqatsi"" the jumble of history and personal memory flash periodically before our eyes. Its not long before Jonas realizes that a life without true feeling is pretty drab. (The film begins in black-and-white before shifting incrementally to color.) Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Its pretty drab anyway. The movie never really sheds its chilly Orwellian vibe and its chief idea - that only The Giver and Jonas can truly feel - is contradicted by the supposedly blanked-out citizens who in fact appear to have feelings indeed albeit nasty ones. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Philip Noyce who has directed some marvelous movies (""The Quiet American"" ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"") does his best to give this hoo-ha some snap but hes mired in the films pretensions. It doesnt help that Bridges doing an old-codger routine seems to be playing his role with cotton-filled cheeks or that Streep with her long braided locks looks like a dyspeptic shepherdess. And what can you do with the scene in which Taylor Swift in a mood-memory flashback introduces Jonas to music? If they were going back in time couldnt they at least have come up with say Chopin or Jimi Hendrix? Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for a mature thematic image and some sci-fi action/violence.)

The Giver The Giver Credit The Weinstein Company By Peter Travers August 15 2014 More News 6 Things We Learned From Jeff Bridges Insightful Reddit AMA Taylor Swift Provides a Haunting Piano Lesson in The Giver All Stories >> The film version of The Giver based on Lois Lowrys Newberry Medal-winning 1993 novel moves at the speed of syrup. Make that the speed of syrup from a clogged spout. Thats no way to carry a philosophical message to young adults. But what is? The current onslaught of movies excreted from dystopian teen fiction would make any YA yak. So far The Hunger Games franchise is working. But catch Divergent The Host Enders Game and The Mortal Instruments City of Bones and see if you dont hear yourself scream Make. It. Stop. More News 6 Things We Learned From Jeff Bridges Insightful Reddit AMA Taylor Swift Provides a Haunting Piano Lesson in The Giver All Stories >> Still I harbored a faint hope for The Giver because Lowrys novel pretty much got there first and it wasnt half bad. She wrote of a futuristic society that terminated pain starvation suffering and war by stifling emotion and making everyone and everything worship as the altar of Sameness. Sounds like Hollywood Philosophy 101 in the here and now. Yet The Giver comes to the screen radiating earnestness. Aussie director Phillip Noyce (Dead Calm Rabbit-Proof Fence The Quiet American) is far from a hack. Even his paycheck films (Clear and Present Danger Salt) show little patience for bullshit. The Giver is also a passion project for its Oscar-winning star Jeff Bridges who optioned the rights in 1995 to star his father Lloyd who died three years later. Now the reliably soulful Bridges 64 takes the title role of the crusty old guy who gets to hold memories of the past in all their beauty and terror. Meryl Streep in a very scary wig show up as the Chief Elder a villain who gets rid of anything old or in the way and makes sure that what The Giver knows wont leak out. Except of course to his replacement. That would be Jonas a child of the new society (raised by parent figures played by Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgard) who is ready to take whatever assignment hes um given. Its a humdinger. Jonass burden is to be The Receiver of the Givers knowledge. Lets stop here a second. In the novel Jonas was 11 years old. Onscreen hes played by Brenton Thwaites 24. The givers in Hollywood know that the leads in movies need to be swoon worthy. So his friends Fiona (Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan) are now played by actors past jailbait age. Whew Pop star Taylor Swift 24 has a cameo as a pre-Jonas Receiver who didnt work out. What? Ill never tell. As Jonas receives memories of color art music literature fashion fun and sex the films palette replaces dull gray with rainbow oomph. Im not kidding. The Giver is obvious like that also dull and remote. The biggest culprit is the script by Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide who are clearly Receivers of every cliche in the Hollywood book. Lowry took chances with her novel. The movie of The Giver takes none. Its safe sorry and a crashing bore. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

But its ultimate vision of humanity itself -- of all the things that this world is missing -- is a crushingly generic one. Add to that some painfully lifeless action and you wind up with a movie that plays like a low-rent Logans Run crossed with a UNICEF commercial. But as noted it starts off pretty well. Theres a sad idealism to the emotional poverty of this sci-fi world known as the Community an antiseptic land where everybodys mildly happy and mildly kind and mildly standoffish. The good stuff that makes life worth living is gone but so too is the bad stuff. ""Fear envy hate ... these werent words so much as sounds"" the teenage protagonist Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) tells us in voice-over. This civilizations rules sound like they could belong in a mental asylum. (Among them ""Dont lie"" ""Take your medication"" ""Obey the curfew"" and my favorite ""Use precise language."") Noyce who has never been a visually fussy director shoots these early scenes in black and white and steers clear of fancy camera moves or showy compositions. Its as if hes absorbed the heads-down never-stray dogma of the Community. Jonas however sees more. He sees occasional bursts of color particularly in his beautiful best friend Fionas (Odeya Rush) red hair and he expresses an earnest wonderment at the world around him. We know all this will get him in trouble. On the annual Ceremony of Advancement a kind of Community-wide graduation ceremony everyone coming of age is given their job and purpose in life in solemn ominously specific language so beloved of dystopias. (""No. 2 Ross. Instructor of the Middles. Thank you for your childhood."") But Jonas is singled out because he doesnt have ordinary talents. He has as the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) puts it ""the capacity to see beyond."" Hes given a sacred duty to become the Communitys next Receiver of Memory which means that he will keep alive -- and keep to himself -- the legacy of knowledge and humanism and history that the Community has so consciously purged. To obtain this secret knowledge Jonas goes to a house perched on the edge of a cliff and meets the current Receiver (Jeff Bridges). The Receiver now becomes the Giver (yes I am chuckling as I write those words) and transmits memories to Jonas of color light children laughing weddings whirling dervishes poverty hunger disease and warA -- ""the secret history of the world when things were different when there was more."" This transfer were told can be dangerous stuff. Ten years ago the Giver tried it with another Receiver-in-training a girl named Rosemary (Taylor Swift in a cameo) and things did not go well. They dont exactly go well this time either. Jonas both troubled and enchanted begins to ask questions. The first half of The Giver works in part because the movies very concept turns liabilities into virtues. The actors stiffness the blandly expository dialogue the antiseptic imagery ... it all makes sense in a world thats been purged of emotion or uncertainty or secrets. This film adaptation was reportedly a dream project for Jeff Bridges and his gruff performance as the Giver cuts through the antiseptic nonsense The actor is clearly enjoying playing the only recognizable human in this dull place and his characters contempt for this world mirrors our own. Meanwhile Streep conveys a cool prim practicality as the Chief Elder the domineering matriarch of this society. But despite a couple of fleeting moments of humanity you start to sense that the largely one-note role isnt worth the presence of such a giant. You keep expecting her to do more for the role to grow and justify her casting but the very opposite happens As the story advances she seems less and less threatening and consequential. Really it could be anybody playing her. Which brings us to some of what ails The Giver. At first were intrigued by the little flashes of color and fleeting joy and even pain that the Giver transmits to Jonas. But as we get more and more of such passages they begin to feel like increasingly cheap attempts at emotional resonance manipulative in the crassest way village dances and weddings and shots of kids with terminal illnesses and sick old men and babies being born stuff designed to milk maximum emotion in as brief a time as possible. You might even be moved by these little montages of stock footage but they lose their value the more we see of them. The more the film relies on them the more you realize that its running out of ideas. The filmmakers desperation becomes even more palpable as the film devolves into a lame chase flick. I havent read Lowrys novel so I dont know how faithful the movie is. And its hard to discuss some of the films more inchoate elements without getting into heavily spoiler-laden territory. But suffice it to say that I found what I was watching to be increasingly rushed and ill-defined governed by rules that dont quite make sense -- even in the vaguely mystical few-degrees-removed reality of this film. Maybe the book explains it better. Or maybe a sequel will reveal all. Movies however should be able to stand on their own. And The Giver starts off promisingly but it loses its sense of purpose.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 15 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 15 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Phillip Noyce Written by Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide Starring Brenton Thwaites Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges Classification PG Year 2014 Country USA Language English Another week another movie about a special adolescent who saves society from the forces of darkness. Lois Lowrys popular 1993 novel The Giver was a trendsetter in the juvenile dystopia genre but 21 years later in the wake of The Hunger Games Divergent and The Lego Movie another movie about a kid rebelling against socially imposed ""sameness"" is a case of the same old same old. Lowrys slender 180-page book which spawned three sequels offered a middle-school readership the grim pleasures of the totalitarian fictions of George Orwell Aldous Huxley and Ray Bradbury and the novel became a curriculum favourite. The Giver was also frequently banished from reading lists by conservative parents groups who objected to material they considered too mature and ethically ambiguous. The movie version adapted by screenwriters Michael Mitnick and Robert Weide puts those concerns to rest.The novels 12-year-old protagonist Jonas is now a teenager (played by poster-boy-handsome 25-year-old Australian actor Brenton Thwaites) and the movies conclusion has all the ambiguity of a sparkly Christmas card.Jonas lives in a closed community on a cloud-ringed plain surrounded by the off-limits ""Elsewhere."" Books music weather even memories and colour have somehow been stripped from daily life. The first half-hour is shot in flat black and white with elements of colour leaking into the frames gradually as Jonass consciousness expands. In Gary Rosss 1998 film Pleasantville that technique was mischievously charming; here its a blunt metaphor.The community where Jonas lives resembles a well-regulated campus or gated resort with boxy modern houses fountains and manicured lawns. He lives with his assigned family unit a mild-mannered father (Alexander Skarsgard) tensely proper mother (Katie Holmes) and little sister Lily (Emma Tremblay). They share ""feelings"" every night and begin each day with an injection to maintain ""sameness."" Each year the big event is a ceremony where the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep looking like an aging hippie in long hair and bangs) assigns a new group of graduates their life work. Jonass friend Asher (Cameron Monaghan) becomes a pilot while the pretty girl Fiona (Odeya Rush) will become a caregiver.Jonas has a special role He will become the Receiver the sole member of his generation allowed to know the groups collective history and to offer advice to the elders council. For his training he goes to the edge of the known world and meets the Giver an old man in a cottage played by Jeff Bridges speaking in orotund tones. Bridges who spent 18 years trying to get this film made (he originally intended his role to be played by his late father Lloyd Bridges) brings a world-weary crackpot charisma to the part but he cant really rescue a film thats undermined by self-righteous gaucheness. The Givers interactions with Jonas set off all kinds of unintended alarm bells intimate contact wrist-grabbing talk of pain secrecy and giving and receiving.If their data-transmitting encounters eventually prove to be benign theyre also banal as Lowrys serious but simplified ideas get reduced to a barrage of visual kitsch. Some images are innocuous (a sleigh ride folk dancing) but the memory flashes graduate to a reel of world events (Vietnam Berlin Wall Tiananmen Square) that feels like a parody of a CNN promo.As Jonas learns about the joys and horrors of the past he also has his eyes opened to the falseness of the world he lives in a loveless system where unwanted babies and old people are euphemistically ""released"" (it sounds like a Tea Party paranoid fantasy of Obamacare). Eventually in the films third act director Phillip Noyce gets a chance to show off his action chops with a chase scene across wild terrain involving fancy drone airplanes cross-cutting dramatic scenes of Jonass escape with violent events on the home front. In the process the movie jettisons the eerie uncertainty of Lowrys novel which ended where an adolescent story should - at the edge of the unknown.

DAVID BLOOMER  DAVID BLOOMER BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The GiverStarring Brenton Thwaites Jeff Bridges Meryl Streep Katie Holmes Directed by Philip Noyce Rated PG-13 for a mature thematic image and some sci-fi action/violence Running time 1 hour 34 minutes Playing In wide releaseThe quick hitThis attack on the dangers of conformity and the nanny state set in a future society that follows the ideology of ""Sameness"" is so reliant on stock melodrama that its hypocritical as well as wispy and familiar. Grade C+ ""The Giver"" is one of those movies that operates like an aesthetic X-ray exposing the weakness of its source material. Lois Lowrys young adult novel could be called ""The First Book of Dystopias."" Its designed to give tween and teen readers an easy-to-read and sure-to-chill look at a future state that creates equality and peace through ""Sameness."" Feel-meh medication numbs any nasty remnants of individuality in the citizenry. Radical climate control denatures nature. Extreme genetic engineering and ""family unit"" planning results in compatible friction-free households. Rules of language and behavior restrict expressions of passion and enforce skin-deep good will. (When adolescents experience ""stirrings"" they get drugs to dissolve them.) Gradually Lowry unveils the homicidal truth behind an ultra-polite community. Readers whove read any other dystopian novel will be way ahead of her. Unfortunately for director Phillip Noyce and screenwriters Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide Lowrys heroes are little more than virtuous tour guides. They make the world of Sameness comprehensible to an audience and rally its sympathies when they rebel. The ruling elders select Hero No. 1 young Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) to be the new Receiver of memories charged with guiding the community through crises with wisdom gleaned from the past. He trains at the book-lined lair of Hero No. 2 the grizzled current Receiver (Jeff Bridges) who reckons he should now be called the Giver. While the rest of society lives in an eternal anti-spectacular now these two experience the agony and joy of a Technicolored history the beauty and ugliness of free human (and animal) behavior and the life-altering hope-inspiring qualities of love. On-screen its relatively easy to accept that memories are transmitted through a laying-on of hands between one gifted paranormal and another. But its difficult to buy the wispier mechanics of Sameness and Receivership. Were told for example that if the Receiver or Giver leaves the community and reaches ""Elsewhere"" the memories hes been holding will flood into each citizens consciousness. How does that work exactly? Director Noyce and company camouflage the flimsiness with a map that charts a physical boundary to memory but the resulting mumbo-jumbo and visual flimflam just make the somber narrative seem silly. The filmmakers do better when they vividly contrast the literally gray world of Sameness with Jonas exploding spectrum. The technique of melting his perceptions of color into pewter-and-white Sameness pleasurably recalls the anti-50s satire ""Pleasantville."" You hope theyll bring the same elan to the all-too-earnest narrative. No such luck. Viewers come alive when Jonas mom (Katie Holmes) curtails any talk of ""love"" with the cold command ""Precision of language"" or when Jonas dad (Alexander Skarsgard) behaves like an eager-to-please Stepford Spouse. And Thwaites a graceful and resourceful male ingenue is at his most engaging when Jonas makes clown faces for a baby. But Noyce and company must have figured that too much humor and irreverence would undercut the dominant tone of sci-fi soap opera. So instead they pile on more blunt melodrama involving Jonas beloved Fiona (Odeya Rush) and his best friend Asher (Cameron Monaghan). Its not enough that Jonas will try to restore passion and beauty and ""completeness"" to his world - he must also save his favorite contemporaries from almost certain death. The moviemakers smartest move is turning the Chief Elder into a major character played by Meryl Streep. As this Big Sister of Sameness presides via hologram over Jonas graduation ceremony Streep imbues the phrase ""We thank you for your childhood"" with subtle menace. Its marvelous to see the American performer most celebrated for her technique go head to head with Bridges our master of instinct. Streep is wizardly at putting fresh inflections into the films most repeated lines - ""I apologize"" and ""I accept your apology"" - and no one is better than Bridges at conveying unvarnished empathy. (He even pours his heart into tear-jerking flashbacks involving the Givers daughter.) But their give-and-take grows increasingly heavy-handed and banal. Not even Streep and Bridges can lift ""The Giver"" beyond the level of a post-apocalyptic after-school special.

Le Guin ya fiction Young Adult Books young adult fiction Entertainment News Jeff Bridges and Brenton Thwaites in ""The Giver"" (Credit The Weinstein Company) Lois Lowrys dystopian novel ""The Giver"" has been profoundly influential since its first publication in 1993 - so much so that its initial impact has almost entirely dissipated. Lowrys books belong more to the old category of childrens fiction or what would today be classified as ""9 to 12 novels"" rather than to the now-ubiquitous and deliberately ambiguous ""young adult"" zone. Its probably fair to describe her as a transitional figure partway between an older tradition of didactic science fiction aimed at young readers - Madeleine LEngle and the underappreciated Sylvia Engdahl come to mind - and contemporary YA best-sellers like Suzanne Collins ""Hunger Games"" and Veronica Roths ""Divergent.""If Bill Cosby had produced a movie adaptation of ""The Giver"" soon after its publication as he apparently intended at least it would have stood a decent chance of becoming a major phenomenon. Instead we get a film of ""The Giver"" 20 years later produced by star Jeff Bridges and directed by capable Hollywood vet Phillip Noyce (""Salt"" ""The Quiet American"") as a late-summer cultural leftover an apparent imitation of things Lowrys book actually inspired. Roths ""Divergent"" series in particular shamelessly rips off its allegorical post-apocalyptic world from ""The Giver"" while remaining barely within the realm of plausible deniability. One could say of course that the concepts involved are more general and more philosophical and go back much further. Lowry herself was borrowing a bit from Orwell a bit more from Ray Bradburys ""Fahrenheit 451"" and Ursula K. Le Guins ""The Dispossessed"" (both science-fiction masterpieces) and a whole lot from Aldous Huxleys ""Brave New World.""I dont want to be a total downer about ""The Giver"" which feels pure of heart by Hollywood standards and offers a relaxed and soulful performance by Bridges as the eponymous Giver the only repository of cultural memory in an anodyne future society. This film is also a total underdog at this point a relatively inexpensive production that has gone through reshoots and multiple delays and now gets dumped onto the market in one of the sleepiest weekends of the year. But the truth is that its dim perfunctory and wide-eyed at least in every moment when Bridges isnt on the screen. Lowrys story is full of logical loopholes to begin with which have not been improved by screenwriters Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide who make a vague intermittent effort to turn this into an action movie. Gestures are made at connecting Lowrys imaginary surveillance society to our world of drone warfare and NSA spybots but they dont add up to much.Mitnick and Weide stick fairly close to Lowrys text (beyond the injection of a little feeble teen romance) but that isnt altogether a good thing. One of the problems with ""The Giver"" if you want to put it this way is that Lowry never makes much of a case for her totalitarian utopia. Color music weather geography history emotion and all forms of sensual pleasure have apparently been eliminated in favor of a pharmaceutically controlled society of ""sameness"" that experiences no war or racism or inequality. As earlier critics of the novel have noted this feels like a writerly contrivance cooked up to make an overly obvious point and never like a plausible social construction. Bradbury Collins and Roth all imagine future societies built around servicing the pleasure principle and other innate human qualities whether or not they are salutary. Le Guins ""Dispossessed"" (easily the best of all these books) is an exceptionally nuanced political allegory about the failures of all totalizing systems whether capitalism socialism or anarchism when faced with the varieties of human experience. Even her anarcho-syndicalist desert society the moon of Anarres takes some reluctant account of the biological need for play. You Might Also Like Theres some enjoyment to be found in the deadpan performances of Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgard as the brainwashed ""parents"" of Jonas the teen hero played by young Australian actor Brenton Thwaites. I use quotation marks because they arent really his parents; babies are born in a lab and assigned to ""family groups"" later. Whenever Jonas makes some angsty teenage comment one of them will say ""Precision of language"" in a gentle but cautionary tone. He then apologizes and they beam ""Your apology is accepted"" Both bogus parents hold horrific jobs (as it turns out) in this suburban surveillance-state world a cluster of fake vegetation and anonymous 1970s-style houses that looks like a rejected sketch from some second-rate follower of Le Corbusier. Jonas is 11 in the novel but 18 here presumably to allow for some hints of passion with his classmate Fiona (the lovely Odeya Rush) in a society that doesnt seem to permit any. (Unsurprisingly we do not learn anything about sex in the community including whether it ever happens.)Thwaites is a handsome nonentity who gives no particular account of himself but that might not be his fault as Jonas is a paper-thin character. He has been selected by the societys Chief Elder (Meryl Streep in a performance that appears - not metaphorically -- to have been phoned in by Skype) to be the communitys Receiver of Memories. This means spending a lot of time with the grizzled old current Receiver (Bridges) who lives alone in a house that literally overlooks the edge of the world and who enjoys certain privileges forbidden to others He owns a library of books can play a little piano and can tell lies for the benefit of society. (I dont know whether Lowry was expounding on the political philosophy of Leo Strauss but it seems possible.) When Jonas sees a grand piano for the first time with the lid raised he exclaims ""That table The food would all slide off"" So the initial setup for the story is engaging enough but Noyce and cinematographer Ross Emery have shot the whole thing in generic digital fake black-and-white so it looks like a late-90s TV commercial for a soon-to-be-recalled compact car. Nothing Jonas learns from Bridges - there used to be fun and also war - explains a single damn thing about how and why this Hermann Goring brain-fart of a future world came to be and by the time we get to Jonas escape everyone involved with this picture is visibly chafing for it to be over. And its pretty short All Ill say about the ending is that I thought it would turn out to be ironic or illusory until the final blackout (which is true to the spirit of Lowrys novel at least) but instead of being those things its just a surrender.

Director Philip Noyce (137). PG-13. Area theaters. ""The Giver"" was ahead of its time as a book. But as a movie its too late. Published in 1993 Lois Lowrys young-adult novel was a deeply felt kid-centered dystopian fantasy. Its world of children learning what their ""perfect"" society had lost was both archetypal yet new. But on screen 21 years later ""The Giver"" will feel too familiar after two editions of ""The Hunger Games"" as well as ""Enders Game"" and ""Divergent"" -- plus ""The Maze Runner"" and the third ""Hunger Games"" coming later this year. As a result ""The Giver"" is a bland also-ran in a world it helped create. The story is set in our distant future. To avoid war humans built solitary communities that follow restrictive but polite rules. ""Sameness"" is crucial (art love and animals are not). ""Parental units"" can apply for one boy and one girl. At 18 after being watched their whole lives by omnipresent elders and their leader (Meryl Streep) kids are assigned a job for life. (The elderly have an annual ceremony of being ""released to Elsewhere"" a euphemism for death.) Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is chosen to be the communitys new Receiver -- the one person allowed to have books and the person designated to receive all the memories of what the world was like before the antiseptic civility. To learn it Jonas becomes the apprentice to the Giver (Jeff Bridges) the elder who possesses all the worlds collective memories. Jonas is chosen because he sees things differently like the red hair of Fiona (Odeya Rush) a girl he likes. Brenton Thwaites and Odeya Rush exist in a conformist society in The Giver. (David Bloomer) Jeff Bridges and Taylor Swift in The Giver (David Bloomer) Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgard in The Giver (David Bloomer) Jeff Bridges mentors Brenton Thwaites in The Giver. (twc) The Giver shares with Jonas memories of snow and rainbows of dissent and bravery of cruelty and war and love. When Jonas wants to tell his friends about how the world used to be -- and save a newborn boy from being killed -- he makes his first real choice. Director Philip Noyces decision to (mostly) avoid the slam-bang action scenes or banal romance of other blockbusters is laudable. Through Bridges gruff but appealing guidance young audiences may become aware of touchstones -- Nelson Mandela for example or Tiananmen Square both of which are glimpsed in the Givers memory -- that they might normally have tuned out. But that doesnt mean the film works as it should. The ""Brave New World""/""Logans Run"" society it depicts seems to have influenced the acting most notably of Katie Holmes who we can guess was channeling memories of Scientology to play Jonas dutiful mother. Streep meanwhile is an angry matriarch figure but shes wasted in an underwritten role. Taylor Swift pops up in an unnecessary cameo as a previous Receiver who didnt work out. Like the character of the Giver this is the elder YA tale the others learned from. Too bad the movie is less than the sum of its parts. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews the giver lois lowry meryl streep brenton thwaites jeff bridges odeya rush katie holmes taylor swift philip noyce drama sci-fi Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

That was nice of them (if perhaps a bit mercenary). They even let him star as the eponymous keeper of societys memories and gave him Meryl Streep to play against. Plus they brought in whole slew of fresh-faced earnest youths some of whom dare to want something more than their muted medicated black-and-white existence. But for a movie about the importance of emotion The Giver is surprisingly inert and also clumsy about hitting its beats. Plus its scattered is it about the importance of feeling or the importance of shared historical memory or the importance of the freedom to fail? Much of the blame must fall on director Phillip Noyce (The Quiet American) but then he was working for his star who also produced. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1118pm on Thursday Aug. 14 2014 Thursday Aug. 14 2014 Thursday Aug. 14 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The Giver director Phillip Noyces handsomely wrought take on Lois Lowrys bestseller may suffer for sins not of its own making.Its the latest in the long line of movies -- The Hunger Games Divergent Enders Game The Host How I Live Now -- made from novels set in a dystopian future where a young person has heroism thrust upon their slim shoulders. So its impossible to look at The Giver and not see it as a Frankenstein film of sorts a collection of cinematic spare parts and young-adult sci-fi cliches.Yet taken on its own its a well-made and effectively told morality tale spiced with some absolutely beautiful moments. It becomes heavy-handed in its third act but even that is not enough to totally undermine its pleasures.Sometime in the future long after some apocalypse has turned society to rubble civilization has been reborn under the watchful eye of the Elders. Social and genetic engineering have removed all differences and theres no conflict; everyone lives in sterile well-ordered peace. (Though you wonder what happened to all the non-white people.) Even language has been purged of all words of deep emotion.Then along comes Jonas (Brenton Thwaites from Maleficent and The Signal) who along with all other young people coming of age is to be assigned to his lifes profession. Whereas his friends Fiona (Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan) are to become child-care nurturers and pilots respectively Jonas is chosen to be a ""receiver"" the one selected to remember all of human history well before this new society wiped everything clean.His teacher is the Giver (Jeff Bridges) -- his predecessor -- who will pass along all of his knowledge. Nervous about the transition is the Chief Elder (a miscast Meryl Streep) because the last young person chosen to be a receiver disappeared mysteriously. The Givers message -- that the place we find our humanity is in the rough-and-tumble between love and hate war and peace -- is hardly new. It seems like every other episode of Star Trek had Captains Kirk or Picard telling some emotionless alien race that hey humans may be creatures of violence and brutality but weve got these little things called love hope free will and generosity of spirit too and theyre pretty cool.What makes The Giver stand out is how its envisioned. Noyce -- best-known for the likes of Patriot Games though its his smaller movies like Rabbit-Proof Fence that are more emblematic -- exhibits a painterly eye as the film paralleling Jonas view of the world moves from stark black-and-white to sepia-shaded tones to joyous color.There are moments that echo such films as Life of Pi and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty two other works where the individual undergoes a journey that makes him see the world in a new color-saturated and life-affirming way.Never mind that Streep doesnt have much to do but look tense. Never mind that the theme has been rehashed many times before.Noyce proves that its not always the story its the storyteller.

"The Giver taketh away Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Giver taketh away ReviewThe Giver the story of a seemingly perfect society that is actually repressive is a tired premise that not even a competent production or an able cast can save. Brenton Thwaites as Jonas and Odeya Rush as Fiona begin to discover forbidden love in The Giver.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Aug. 14 2014The GiverStarring Brenton Thwaites Jeff Bridges Meryl Streep. Directed by Phillip Noyce. 94 minutes. Playing at GTA theatres. PGPeace social cohesion equality for all and none left wanting. The world of The Giver on a high plateau surrounded by snowy clouds seems idyllic.All you have to do is take your daily injection obey the nightly curfew never lie wear the clothes they give you take the job for life they assign you and rear the children they decide you should raise.Article Continued BelowNo bright colours no music and -- oh yes -- no visible minorities. It takes about two milliseconds to realize the utopia created by The Elders following ""the Ruin"" would appeal to only most dull-witted white supremacist.So once youve gotten the lesson at the heart of the film the rest of The Giver seems almost redundant. Its rather a problem.Still the audience must endure as we meet Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) who at 18 is assigned to become the next Receiver of all those nasty memories left behind safely stored in the cranium of The Giver (Jeff Bridges) and ready to be shared via a sort of Vulcan mind meld.It doesnt take long for Jonas to realize how repressive his society truly is as he begins to feel love (also banned) for Fiona (Odeya Rush). If only he can get past the ""boundary"" to Elsewhere with his new younger brother Gabriel (no relation) all those bad memories (war sickness income tax etc.) and some good ones will magically come flooding back. Its unclear why this is a desirable outcome.Veteran director Phillip Noyce makes wonderful use of neutral tones -- black grey and sepia -- to denote the world as seen through everyones eyes while gradually and strategically introducing flashes of vivid colours -- apple red blue eyes golden sunsets etc. -- to portray old memories and Jonass growing knowledge and understanding.The sets and costumes are well conceived and executed and theres no shortage of talent in the casting department.Meryl Streep literally beams in much of her performance as the Chief Elder with a hairstyle severe enough to match her censorious air.Handsome tall and lean Aussie actor Thwaites is perfectly adequate in the central role of Jonas though the role requires little use of his skills as he goes from blissful ignorance to consternation.Bridges employing the same cotton-balls-in-the-cheeks voice technique he used portraying Rooster Cogburn in the gritty and wonderful remake of True Grit in 2010 is always watchable but brings nothing new to his role as the Giver.Tom Cruise ex Katie Holmes a former Scientology fembot is perhaps ironically cast as Jonass un-maternal mother and theres a brief and forgettable appearance by country music star Taylor Swift as the Givers long-deceased daughter.There are a few moments that stir the heart -- including footage of a bull elephant being felled by trophy hunters -- but the storyline is as bland and predictable as the perfect world it portrays.The film is based on Lois Lowrys Newbery Award-winning novel for childrens literature (in which the Jonas character is actually 11 not 18). But for discerning adults The Giver is neither illuminating challenging nor compelling.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

But there also might be a good reason that the novel--which imagines a (literally) colorless thought-controlled society that has banished memory of the past--took so long to finally come to the screen. Brenton Thwaites (Maleficents Prince Phillip) plays Jonas a young man who sees flickers of color in the dreary Brave New World of sameness around him. Because of his gift hes chosen to be the next Receiver of Memories the one person who bears all the pain--and pleasure--of humanitys past so that the governments status quo can be preserved. Unfortunately his apprenticeship under the outgoing Receiver a.k.a. the Giver (Jeff Bridges) is built upon cerebral gobbledygook that the screenplay and director Phillip Noyce never quite find a way to package visually. Instead we get flashes of lifes beauty and mans cruelty and when desperate more and more underlined dialogue about the power of human emotions and the shackles of sameness. Bridges who spent nearly 20 years trying to bring the novel to the screen seems trapped playing the passive seer and Meryl Streeps villainous turn as the Jane Campion-haired Chief Elder will test the blind devotion of Golden Globe voters. In the end the film practically collapses under its own...hmm whats the opposite of weight? In any case it falls apart with a slapdash final act that doesnt work as drama or action and only serves to undermine Jonass heroics. Its treated as a quest so non-Herculean that you wonder why the Giver didnt do the job himself years ago. Maybe he just lost interest too.

The Giver is the first film rendition of the popular 1993 young adult novel by Lois Lowry. Courtesy of The Weinstein Co. Multiplexes Heat Up For Summer Blockbuster Season May 26 2014 Australian Filmmaker Phillip Noyce Gets Serious Nov. 25 2002 It might seem hard to describe The Giver without revealing some of those plot points that touchy suspense fans call ""spoilers."" But this brisk deftly art-directed parable is basically unspoilable. Even viewers who know nothing of its source Lois Lowrys 1993 novel will be able to anticipate every development. Thats because Lowrys vision of a serene but secretly corrupt future society offers little that wasnt imagined decades earlier in 1984 Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451. Lowry just cooked such books down for a preteen audience that hasnt read them. After years of trying producer and star Jeff Bridges finally got The Giver made because of the success of The Hunger Games and similar tales of noble teens in a world run by manipulative adults. So the first task was aging the novels protagonist (Jonas played by Brenton Thwaites) from 12 to 16. Jonas lives in a community called ""the community"" thats any high schoolers vision of hell Its run by guidance counselors. Where in Divergent the kids were separated into different castes upon graduation in The Giver theyre given specific assignments. None is more specific than Jonas. Hes the new receiver assigned to learn the real history of humanity from the bearded avuncular title character (Bridges clearly enjoying the sound of his own voice). i Katie Holmes (left) and Alexander Skarsgard play Jonas parents who support the efforts of The Givers dystopian government. David Bloomer/Courtesy of The Weinstein Co. hide caption toggle caption David Bloomer/Courtesy of The Weinstein Co. Katie Holmes (left) and Alexander Skarsgard play Jonas parents who support the efforts of The Givers dystopian government. David Bloomer/Courtesy of The Weinstein Co. Among the many questions the movie barely attempts to answer is why do the positions of giver and receiver exist? The elders led by an often holographic Meryl Streep dont want anyone else to know about the bad old days of war famine and hatred. So why not assign Jonas to flip burgers for the rest of his life and send the Giver on a long walk off a short pier? Because of course there is violence just beneath the communitys veneer of calm. Thats one of the alarming if unsurprising things Jonas learns once he starts receiving -- and stops taking his daily dose of mood controller. As in the substantially more macho Equilibrium ingestion of a Valium-like drug is required. This relaxant suppresses emotion and individuality and even its users ability to distinguish color. So the first part of The Giver is in black and white like Pleasantville. If the movie hits ominous notes theyve all been heard many times before There are no books or music in the futuristic planned community human reproduction is controlled by the state kissing is unknown and families are not genetically related. Jonas has merely been assigned to his father (Alexander Skarsgard) and mother (a drawn-faced Katie Holmes). To make it less of a kiddie story director Phillip Noyce and scripters Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide have added romance (Jonas has the unauthorized hots for a classmate played by Odeya Rush) and boosted the action. There are chase scenes -- including one on a bike path thats lighted even though people arent allowed to go out at night -- and confrontations. Also modestly exciting are the fragmentary flashbacks to a former receiver played by Taylor Swift. (She and the community broke up and they are never ever getting back together.) Ultimately Jonas must make a choice and leave his sterile home for the forbidden outback. Its not a spoiler to reveal that he finds a refuge there. Or that this new abode offers the sort of picture-postcard coziness that could have been simulated by his former communitys devious elders.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 332 p.m. EDT August 14 2014Brenton Thwaites as protagonist Jonas in The Giver.(Photo David Bloomer The Weinstein Company)Lois Lowrys prize-winning novel The Giver pre-dated Divergent by a couple of decades yet the film version of her beloved book feels like a re-hash of that dystopian sci-fi thriller.While the 1993 book was a thoughtful subtle meditation on mind control and the blandness of life in a pseudo-Utopia the movie doesnt convey that depth ( out four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide). It changes some plot points but more important it lacks the resonance and mythic quality of Lowrys literary allegory.While the adult performances are strong especially Jeff Bridges in the title role youthful characterizations are not nearly as illuminating as they were on the page.Overall the long-awaited adaptation is visually handsome but disappointing and thematically flattened. It suffers from comparison to the surfeit of teen-centered dystopian thrillers in recent years such as Divergent and The Hunger Games also based on popular books.USA TODAYThe latest movie reviewsUSA TODAYGiver author gladly takes film version of her novelUSA TODAYDailyDish Taylor Swift doesnt add much to The GiverBridges who has wanted to make a film of the book since he optioned it in 1996 is convincing as The Giver. Its an honored position in his well-ordered community but takes its toll on the bearded recluse.His job is to pass on his compendium of intensely felt memories to young Jonas (Brenton Thwaites). In the novel Jonas had just turned 12 when hes selected to be the new Receiver of Memory. In the movie hes clearly older looking about 16 (though Thwaites is actually 25). The film also introduces a youthful romance that feels forced.Jonas lives in a world of sameness. Conflict and strong emotions have been eradicated through strict rules imposed politeness language precision and medication.It was decided much earlier that the community should not be burdened by memories of how life used to be One brave person is selected to be keenly aware of a wide range of experiences that others know nothing about love excitement war suffering colors. The aging Giver is passing the baton to the young Receiver.Jonas lost innocence and subsequent outrage at what his world lacks worked better with his character being younger. In the book Jonas found the adult role difficult longing to return to his carefree days of childhood play. Lowrys powerful but simply written narrative takes its time as Jonas anger mounts. The film leapfrogs over some of that progression and tempers the effect of Jonas reaction rendering the concept far less involving on screen.Meryl Streep plays the Chief Elder in a more villainous way than the character was written. In the book the elders were not nefarious just misguidedly determined to preserve the peace and ignorant comfort of their society. Director Philip Noyce has decided to make her more of a fearsome Big Brother figure. She appears repeatedly as a hologram for no good reason and seems like a stock character from other dystopian dramas.Lowrys prose was more evocative than the dialogue in the film. The memories featured here dont have the poignant quality of those in the book (the first experience of snow or a glimpse of a family celebrating Christmas). Instead memory montages feel impersonal and broadly global as if they were a United Colors of Benetton ad.The movies weakest segment is an extended action climax that turns this potent allegory -- and its open-ended denouement -- into a generic action thriller complete with drones and menacing enforcers racing around on motorized bikes.For those who have not read the book the movie will seem derivative. And for those who have read it it is likely to feel disappointing for the dimension it leaves out. 31 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/Vq0VLB",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/08/14/the-giver-review/12970423/,200,thegiver22,thegiver,usatoday

Comments (4) click to enlarge The Giver Video Rated PG-13  94 minutes  2014 A winner of the Newbery Medal Lois Lowrys novel The Giver (1993) prefigured such publishing juggernauts as The Hunger Games and Divergent with its story of a bland futuristic society in which conformity is valued above all else and a teenage hero learns to question the social order. Incredibly this screen adaptation is rated PG-13 which means that parents who will probably find it excruciatingly simpleminded are cautioned to keep it away from their middle school children the only viewers who might possibly enjoy it. Jeff Bridges who spent years trying to bring the book to the screen plays the title character a mystical mentor who schools the hero in humanitys forgotten legacy of physical and emotional violence; Meryl Streep is the chief elder an ice queen who wants to stop this pair from lousing up their antiseptic Eden.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1253 p.m. MST August 14 2014Philip Noyces film based on the much-loved Lois Lowry young-adult novel boasts a good cast but falls flat on the screen.Brenton Thwaites in a scene from ""The Giver.""(Photo On Screen Entertainment)Story HighlightsCritics review 2 starsThe cast is game but given little to do.Its not a bad movie just one that falls flat.In a crowd of young-adult works about dystopian futures the film doesnt stand out.The future doesnt look bright.Not if you judge by movies based on young-adult novels anyway. Whether its ""The Hunger Games"" or ""Divergent"" or now ""The Giver"" one would surmise that we are heading toward a dystopian future in which various of our freedoms will be curtailed or taken away completely. Itll be up to a teenager to save the day or at least bridge the gap between sequels.""The Giver"" a rather lackluster too-obvious effort is no different in any of those regards. Based on the much-loved oft-taught book by Lois Lowry director Phillip Noyces film is set in a near future that would seem to be a utopia. There is no pain no war no class distinction. Everything is black and white. No joke; the scenes at the beginning of the film are monochrome.Of course there is also no freedom of choice or freedom of anything really. No love no romance no hugging and kissing. Makes you wonder where all the people come from. Everyone dresses in the same drab white outfits. All the kids ride the same kind of clunky white one-speed bicycles. (Hills seem to have been removed from the equation.) Mention words like ""love"" and you get smacked down with a ""precision of language"" admonition.Brenton Thwaities and Odeya Rush star in a scene from ""The Giver."" (Photo On Screen Entertainment)Once a year there is a ceremony in which all of the kids who are becoming adults are assigned jobs by the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep no less). They have no say in the matter of course; its all decided for them by the Elders. Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) awaits anxiously as his friends Fiona (Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan) are given their jobs.Jonas wont get one. He is chosen to be the Receiver of Memory. He alone will know mans real history with all of its ugliness and -- duh -- beauty and will use this wisdom to help the Elders run the place. The current Receiver (Jeff Bridges) thus becomes the Giver; during sessions at his bunker-like library (the only books left in society are housed here) he passes everything good and bad to Jonas.AZCENTRALAll the reviews Weekend movie guide for PhoenixThese scenes are among the films strongest. Its a crash course in what a 15-year-old would probably string together as historys most important events along with lifes experiences. Flowers bloom people die. They could have said ""circle of life"" and been done with it but Disney would doubtless protest.Whatever the case the visual mash-up as Jonas receives the information (by clasping hands with the Giver) is exciting if somewhat rushed. (Theres a lot of history to cover if youre going for all of mankind.)AZCENTRALInterview Jeff Bridges long journey to make GiverJonas begins to see in color and to realize that maybe this seemingly perfect society isnt so perfect after all. What transpires deviates from the book but surprise anyone who has seen this type of movie before (and given the glut of them that group probably includes ... I dont know every girl 16 and younger probably).Jeff Bridges and Brenton Thwaities star in a scene from ""The Giver."" (Photo On Screen Entertainment)The cast is good but not given much to do in terms of real acting. Alexander Skarsgard is so muted as Jonas father for instance that hes practically somnambulant. Katie Holmes as Jonas super-strict mother meanwhile is ... well Katie Holmes.This isnt a terrible movie. It just falls flat in almost every way. It exists and not much else.AZCENTRALSomething for everyone 52 Fall films for 2014Its all too predictable and way too heavy-handed. Movies like this dont trust their audience enough as opposed to say ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" or ""The Spectacular Now"" two young-adult films based on books that let their audiences discover what theyre trying to say instead of hitting them over the head with it.For ""The Giver"" you might as well wear a helmet.Review The Giver 2 starsDirector Philip Noyce.Cast Brenton Thwaites Jeff Bridges Meryl Streep.Rating PG-13 for a mature thematic image and some sci-fi action/violence.AZCENTRALThe Giver (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes Reviews 16 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/Vnb9w8 More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

(AP Photo/ The Weinstein Company David Bloomer) Photo David Bloomer Associated Press The Giver review how it feels to be the one who feels 1 / 5 Back to Gallery The Giver Sci-Fi Drama. Starring Brenton Thwaites Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep. Directed by Philip Noyce. (PG-13. 94 minutes.) In the post-apocalypse order is all-important. We know this not only because that makes intuitive sense but because just in the last few months weve seen ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Divergent"" which also deal with what happens after a civil collapse. ""The Giver"" the latest in this weird trend approaches a now-familiar topic from a new angle and of the three its the most visually arresting. If were keeping score ""The Giver"" lacks the wit and political sophistication of ""Snowpiercer"" but it avoids the sentimentality and teen romance quality of ""Divergent."" Whats especially interesting is that the world it creates doesnt look bad at all at least at first glance. Everyones clean. Everyones well-fed. Everyone has a nice house. Things could be a lot worse. We see Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) who narrates the story and watch him with his two closest friends Asher (Cameron Monaghan) and Fiona (Odeya Rush). They just seem like normal kids laughing and riding bicycles past white buildings that look exactly like computer monitors from 1988. To see these early scenes is to think that theres just something irreducible about human nature that no matter what the environment people will always be more or less the same. In fact the journey of the movie suggests something else - that a rigid system can numb and distort the most essential aspects of the human character.

They dont get to choose. The elders choose for them. Jonas lands the most prestigious and bizarre job of all to become his generations ""Receiver."" He will know things that even the societys elders dont know all of human history the glorious and the ghastly; all the ancient social practices and all the emotions. In a city in which the whole population is on mood stabilizers Jonas will get off them and actually start feeling things. Jonas transition from deadened to impassioned is illustrated by the cinematography which moves slowly from glossy black-and-white into muted and then saturated color over the first half of the movie. To watch Jonas getting educated is irresistible partly because its always fun to see someone marveling at what we already know. Beyond that director Philip Noyce introduces stirring montages to simulate the rush of fresh knowledge illustrated by brightly colored images of sunsets on the ocean tribal dances and Renaissance wedding ceremonies. By showing Jonas the beauty of the world and the occasional splendor of people Noyce is showing those things to us. The transmitter of knowledge - ""The Giver"" of the title - is played by Jeff Bridges with all the sadness suppressed frustration and dignity that comes with wildly superior knowledge. The movie depicts his house laden with books as literally sitting on top of a cloud a privileged view that takes on a melancholy aspect on repeat viewings. Meryl Streep plays the smiling blond chief elder whose bumbling and motherly facade hides a dark and pessimistic view of humanity. But then its not as if humanitys reputation hasnt been earned. Someone should come along and do a book on the treatment of the post-apocalypse in 21st century American cinema because there are odd parallels and currents between films that cant be addressed in a review. Such a book would be certain to become a best-seller - but not until after the apocalypse. Aldous Huxley wrote about the use of drugs to lull the populace in ""Brave New World"" but he was thinking of drugs that made people feel good. He wasnt thinking about the drugs we have now that enable people to feel less or nothing. ""The Giver"" takes a tortured individuals dilemma and turns it into societal question If our emotions make us human but our emotions keep leading us into catastrophe how much of our essence are we willing to give up just get some peace?

"The Giver Review Dull version of Lois Lowry best-seller - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review The Giver  The Giver David Bloomer / The Weinstein Company A scene from ""The Giver."" A scene from ""The Giver."" (David Bloomer / The Weinstein Company) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Another cheery slice of YA dystopia makes it to the screen in The Giver At this point in the dystopian movie cycle Im ready for a story about a teenager with zero interest in questioning the system let alone starting a revolution. A spineless conformist -- thats what the genre needs.Meantime theres ""The Giver"" director Phillip Noyces film version of the 1993 Lois Lowry best-seller which remains a staple of the young adult shelves alongside the ""Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" books. So here we are again. Its the future. Life is like ""Logans Run"" with shorter haircuts. (That film starring Michael York and Farrah Fawcett-Majors remains the shaggiest of all dystopian totalitarian adventures.) Speaking of hair Meryl Streep in the steely role of the Chief Elder sports a do that can only be described as ""disgruntled food co-op manager."" So Future. Planet nearly ruined thanks to ""climate control."" Animal and plant life destroyed. The surviving communities resembling a post-apocalyptic edition of Long Islands Levittown adhere to strict rules of conduct conformity heavy doses of mood-stabilizing drugs for all citizens and a nightmarish take on peace equality and socialism. As there always is in these stories a sorting ritual determines the role in society each young citizen will play. Our hero Jonas played by Noyces fellow Aussie Brenton Thwaites is selected for a very special occupation that of the Receiver of Memories to be schooled by the current and controversial RM played by top-billed Jeff Bridges.Books are banned in this future as are ""stirrings"" of a sexual nature and music even. The Bridges character is able to transmit knowledge and sensory recollections of what snow was like and the color of an apple. Jonas pals Fiona (Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan) join Jonas in his mission to change the way things are in this most emotionally Botoxed of all possible worlds. Katie Holmes and Alexander Skarsgard portray Jonas parents who know their kid is special but cant give him the leeway he craves lest the entire society crumble. The world according to ""The Giver"" isnt above killing off elders and unhealthy newborns by the hundreds a sinister plot point alluded to nervously by Noyce and by screenwriters Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide. Like ""Pleasantville"" Noyces film establishes its colorlessness literally; much of the footage is conveyed in black and white or sepia tones with splashes of color strategically placed to establish what lies beyond the present circumstances.Its not a lousy experience. Taylor Swift shows up in a glorified cameo. Thwaites has promise; Rush has more than that. But for a movie decrying the concept of societal ""sameness"" ""The Giver"" is a hypocritical movie indeed. To borrow another phrase from Lowry each new entry in the teen dystopia genre has become a sort of ""comfort object"" imagining a terrible future while placating younger audiences with heroes and heroines who can make a difference. We all need that sort of thing in our pop culture lives I suppose. But ""The Giver"" gives off an air of wearying familiarity without much in the way of design wiles or cinematic wonder beyond the spectacle of Streep competing for her share of the movie against her own hair.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Why did it take two decades for someone to make The Giver into a movie? Lois Lowrys new classic of young-adult literature has been a staple of middle-school classrooms almost as long as its been in bookstores; like training wheels for 1984 or Brave New World the novel has eased a couple generations of American adolescents into the world of big-idea science-fiction. But if the long wait for a proper big-screen adaptation is perplexing its no mystery why that wait has finally ended Phillip Noyces futuristic melodrama is a Giver for the post-Katniss era its narrative now adorned with CGI-abetted action scenes and its nominal romance slightly inflated to draw in the target demographic. The ironic side effect is that this major influence on todays new class of dystopian YA smashes now looks like just another greedy knockoff on-screen--a monochromatic Divergent or something similar.The lack of color is actually one aspect of Lowrys vision that hasnt been compromised. Despite what the trailer seemed to suggest much of The Giver unfolds in black-and-white forcing audiences to see its sterilized climate-controlled world in the same drab shades of gray as its characters do. Primary colors begin to flood the frame only gradually as Jonas (Brenton Thwaites bland but maybe on purpose) gains access to the spectrum of light denied his fellow civilians. Named the new Receiver Of Memories by the elders of the community the teenage boy pays daily visits to The Giver (Jeff Bridges perfectly cast) a wizened hermit who shares with him all knowledge of mankinds troubled past. As he absorbs these ancient impressions--not just of color but also of weather holidays animals pain grief sex war and everything else societys engineers have eliminated--Jonas begins to realize that the perfect world in which he lives isnt so perfect after all.As written The Giver is a cautionary tale about sheltering oneself from experience and some of its poignant points--about accepting heartache as the price of feeling about squaring humanitys capacity for love against its history of hate--have survived the transition from page to screen. But in many ways Noyce has dumbed down his source material making concessions to a hypothetical audience. Rather than reveal the details of the world gradually and organically as Lowry did the film opens with a hand-holding exposition dump--a choice that stinks of interference from distributor Harvey Weinstein. The more irksome alterations arrive later Not only do Noyce and his screenwriters needlessly amp up the teen love story and add a race-against-the-clock element to the final act they also include a scene in which Bridges haunted sage actively debates the storys themes with Meryl Streeps severe Chief Elder. Is the conversation meant to function like a Cliffs Note destroying subtext to help young viewers ace their English quiz? In twisting The Giver to resemble a more modern class of YA bestseller the filmmakers risk stripping it of its individuality. ""Sameness"" as the book warned is not to be celebrated.

It is a lesson lost on its own filmmakers. The original novel -- an award-winning childrens book by Lois Lowry -- had as its hero a 12-year-old. The new movie makes him 18 -- mostly it seems so it can add in a plausible romance and tap into an older audience with bigger allowances. Except that the very fact the hero of the book was 12 or so was what made it powerful -- it really was about the loss of innocence. And that made it matter in a way that the Narnia books and ""Enders Game"" did too and the current crop of YA novels cant understand. This wasnt an already disaffected teen struggling to survive. This was a child. But theres no utopia like dystopia and so a powerful book has been dusted off and tarted up so it can -- its studio clearly hopes -- spawn a sequel (or two) and grab some of the teenage fans who already flocked to the suspiciously similar ""Divergent."" Dont bet on it. ""The Giver"" comes from Australian director Philip Noyce an odd choice -- apart from the occasional backdated drama about racism or repression (""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" ""The Quiet American"" ""Catch a Fire"") most of his films have been pure popcorn explosions like ""Salt."" Yet working with director of photography Ross Emery -- another filmmaker from big loud genre pictures -- the truth is hes given this film a delicate look. Thats important; a central conceit is that along with feeling these future citizens have given up color. They see everything in muted black-and-white. Its not a very subtle metaphor but the film makes good use of it -- letting its hero notice flashes of blurry hues at first then letting single shades appear in otherwise monochromatic scenes and finally moving on to riotously saturated reds blues and greens. If only the rest of the film were so vibrant. But the inexpressive Brenton Thwaites -- already an inconsequential presence this year in ""Oculus"" and ""Maleficent"" -- does nothing here to establish himself as someone worth watching let alone caring about. His girlfriend Odeya Rush is equally bland. True there is a certain snarky humor in seeing Katie Holmes playing the unquestioning member of a gibberish-spouting all-controlling cult. But Meryl Streeps part as the Old Evil Person is pure YA cliche - the bossy parent whos running (and ruining) your life -- while Taylor Swifts bit part is there strictly to get her name on the poster. And although Jeff Bridges clearly fiercely believes in this material (he fought for years to get it produced) as the title character the keeper of all human history he does too little and talks too much (and seems to do even that with a mouthful of marbles). Despite that calamitous switch in character age the film is otherwise mostly faithful to the book. The set design is interesting and when its speeding along on pure imagery -- the waterfall the characters sometimes hide behind the hologram-driven public rituals the explosion of filmclip memories -- the movie has some life. But in a too-crowded world of young-adult franchises mostly it succeeds best at providing only what its villains so fervently desire -- unsurprising unrelenting sameness. Ratings note The film contains violence. The Giver (R) Weinstein (98 min.) Directed by Phillip Noyce. With Brenton Thwaites Jeff Bridges Meryl Streep.

Photo The Weinstein Company MOVIE REVIEW The Giver Running time 97 minutes Rated PG-13 (sci-fi action violence). At the Cinema 1 the 34th St. others. The quick-cut trailers may spin it like the next ""Divergent"" but thats a marketing ruse ""The Giver"" adapted from the award-winning 1993 novel by Lois Lowry is something different slower and more old-school -- a kindly grandfather to those YA sagas. Not an insult. Who among us is hungering for another ""Hunger Games"" anyway? Director Phillip Noyce (""Salt"") gives us a film that feels more like a fable than a thriller (excepting a rather tacked-on chase ending) with a certain corresponding fuzziness of logic. But the central premise -- that wildness of spirit isnt something to be tamed no matter how messy it makes our lives -- is an enduring one and well served by Jeff Bridges in the title role. From a vague future narrator and protagonist Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) describes humanitys reinvention after ""The Ruin"" forming communities defined by their adhesion to a rigid code of rules on everything from dress to meds Everyone gets a morning injection of a libido-killing antidepressant. ""Sameness"" is the watchword with the groups Chief Elder (Meryl Streep in a regrettable gray wig) praising the beauty of a world in which ""disorder became harmony"" not to put too Orwellian a point on it. The result looks like an average upscale subdivision with manicured walkways identical houses and a bicycle-sharing system that puts Citi Bike to shame. Brenton Thwaites ""Jonas"" is at the center of the story.Photo The Weinstein Company Eighteen-year-old Jonas and his friends are on the cusp of graduation waiting for their career assignments. While his buddy Asher (Cameron Monaghan) gets to pilot drones and pretty Fiona (Odeya Rush) goes to the nursery Jonas is chosen to become the next Receiver of Memory as its become one persons job to retain the entire history of humanitys chaotic past. The current Receiver (Bridges doing his grizzled-sage thing) imparts this knowledge to Jonas through the laying on of hands or something like that. In time Jonas learns that humans werent always Stepford people devoid of class religion sexual desire and even color The first half of the film is almost entirely black and white adding to its retro feel. In a series of Terrence Malick-esque visions Jonas learns the best and worst of what the world used to be boisterous wedding parties impassioned protests body-strewn battlefields. That last was what did in his predecessor played by a blink-and-youll-miss-her Taylor Swift who took one look at humanitys capacity for bloodshed and checked out. ""The Giver"" is at its best when Bridges expounds on civilizations lost beauty and savagery; at other times its strewn with implausibility For a totalitarian society in which everyone is monitored constantly our hero is able to sneak around an awful lot. Jonas begins to chafe at the confines of his assigned ""family unit"" helmed by designated mom Katie Holmes (fitting unsettlingly well into the zombie-mom role) and father figure Alexander Skarsgard whose job is to ""release"" those deemed unsuitable for the community to ""elsewhere."" (Three guesses what that really means.) The unsuitable are largely incubator-raised babies and old people and this plot point seems easy Tea Party fodder. But the beauty of Lowrys story is in its broadness of metaphor reminding us that even at our worst our emotions and passions and differences are what make life worth living. Personally I saw it as a clarion call for us to question a life lived online ""Knowing something"" the Giver tells Jonas ""is different from knowing how something feels.""

And according to the Posts Ann Hornaday if you liked the book youll like the movie adaptation. (Jayne W. Orenstein/The Washington Post) By Ann Hornaday August 12 2014 Follow AnnHornaday ""The Giver"" an adaptation of Lois Lowrys Newbery Medal-winning young adult novel may seem like its riding on the coattails of such dystopian action hits as ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent."" But in reality Lowrys book may qualify as the ur-text of the form a slim futuristic allegory that since it was published in 1993 has sold more than 10 million copies. In its own way the movie version -- handsomely directed by Phillip Noyce and featuring an appealing sure-footed cast of emerging and veteran actors -- aptly reflects ""The Givers"" pride of place as the one that started it all or at least the latest wave. Ironically it wasnt until its imitators became box office bonanzas that ""The Giver"" was seen potentially profitable enough to produce for the big screen. Far less noisy and graphically violent than those films this mournful coming-of-age tale feels like their more subdued and introspective older sibling even as it trafficks in the self-dramatizing emotionalism and simplistic philosophizing that are so recognizably symptomatic of the YA genre. Set in an indeterminate future long after a vaguely drawn catastrophe called The Ruin ""The Giver"" chronicles the story of Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) a teenager who has grown up in the Communities where the all-seeing all-hearing Council of Elders controls everything from domestic arrangements and careers to climate and sexual ""stirrings"" which are carefully regulated by way of daily morning injections. Jonass world which he navigates with his best friends Fiona (the stunning Israeli actress Odeya Rush) and Asher (Cameron Monaghan) is one in which all conflict hatred and distinction has been erased by cultural values of conformity and obedience. This is a literally color-blind society its black-and-white contours reflecting not only the Elders monotonously authoritarian sensibility but Lowrys own conveniently Manichean imagination in which emotions and empiricism are at constant zero-sum odds. As ""The Giver"" begins Jonas and his contemporaries are about to find out what jobs theyve been assigned by the chief Elder played by Meryl Streep in a long gray wig that recalls Holly Hunters blunt-spoken separatist leader in the series ""Top of the Lake."" It turns out that Jonas -- who unlike his friends and family is able to see color -- has been chosen to be a Receiver of Memory meaning that he will soon learn all that happened before the world became the reassuringly predictable and consistent bubble in which he grew up. Jeff Bridges and Brenton Thwaites in ""The Giver"" an adaptation of the young adult novel by Lois Lowry. (The Weinstein Company) His guide in this endeavor is the title character of ""The Giver"" a bearded sage living in an isolated mountaintop aerie played with shamanic gruffness by Jeff Bridges. As it happens Bridges himself was the prime engine in getting ""The Giver"" made after a decades-long struggle during which he intended that his father Lloyd play the part he ultimately took as his own. That commitment and seriousness of purpose suffuse a production that will surely please the millions of people who read ""The Giver"" in middle school and for whom it became much more than a good book and more like a potent talisman of their own emerging notions of individuation moral choice and transcendent self-sacrifice. Although Jonas is only 12 in the book in the filmed version of ""The Giver"" he is 16 -- and played by an Australian in his mid-20s a digression from novelistic detail that has already sent Lowrys partisans into howls of how-dare-they distress. But Thwaites who was recently seen as a handsome prince in ""Maleficent"" acquits himself well in a role that makes the most of his sober Gary Cooper-esque good looks. Filmed in silvery tones of black and white ""The Giver"" gradually gives way to a color scheme that is lurid or muted depending on what experiences Jonas is accessing with the help of his grizzled mentor. Although those memories will eventually send him on a genuine physical adventure replete with a shattering revelation and high-stakes drone chase most of the film traces a young mans dawning awareness that the ease and peacefulness of his world notwithstanding theres something frighteningly toxic at its core. (One quibble with ""The Giver"" is that at a sleek hour-and-a-half some of its most dramatically ripe scenes play too quickly and perfunctorily to convey the impact theyre having on Jonas; no sooner has he witnessed an unspeakable horror than it swiftly disappears filed away in his burgeoning internal archive.) Like its fellow YA movies -- which with the current juggernaut of comic-book adaptations represent the dominant culture in Hollywood -- ""The Giver"" perceptively caters to its teenaged fans own cardinal desires and anxieties. Messy feelings youthful curiosity and unruly physical impulses are valorized and elevated in sharp contrast to the Elders Stalinistic attempts at social control. As a Receiver of Memory and in one of the films most obvious nods to teenaged wish fulfillment Jonas is given permission to ask questions no matter how rude and to lie -- and he never has to apologize. Meanwhile what he hears from parents and other authority figures is portrayed as the stuff of dehumanizing soul-murder. ""Precision of language"" Jonass mother scolds him when he shares his feelings one night over dinner. Mom by the way is played by Katie Holmes in a suitably chilly performance as a rule-obsessed judge intimations of the actresss own recent brush with Scientology hovering over her scenes like a teasing troubling mist. Jonass father equally skillfully portrayed by Alexander Skarsgard features prominently in ""The Givers"" most disturbing sequence in which Jonas witnesses one of the grisly realities beneath the anodyne double-speak that hes now beginning to question. That double-speak of course recalls George Orwell at his most anti-totalitarian as well as Ray Bradburys ""Fahrenheit 451"" which may be ""The Givers"" most direct ancestor. Like ""The Fault in Our Stars"" earlier this summer young people have once again been given their generations version of a message that although not necessarily new nevertheless may feel urgent and uniquely timely to its core audience. ""The Giver"" has been made with deep respect for that experience and for the book that so powerfully predicted the grim universe movie teenagers now inhabit -- for worse and in this case for better as well.

Daily Edition Login to download The Giver Film Review 900 PM PDT 8/11/2014 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A lazy ending mars this fine if generic take on a much-loved YA novel. TWITTER Lois Lowrys 1993 bestselling novel enters the YA-movie marketplace An agreeable YA riff on Orwell -- via Logans Run -- topped with the kind of magic-transformative baloney that passes for an ending in too many otherwise-fine Hollywood adventures Phillip Noyces The Giver greets a man-made Utopia with the eternal question ""If you cant feel whats the point?"" Lois Lowrys 1993 Newbery Medal-winning source novel has been substantially altered here mostly in ways that nudge it toward other chosen-one teen fantasies set in restrictive futuristic worlds (Divergent being one of the most recent). The changes which include making the books 12-year-old hero old enough to make tween viewers swoon (hes played by 25-year-old Aussie Brenton Thwaites) surely enhance marketability even if they sand some edges off a tale that has won many hearts over the years. The presence of Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep in supporting roles will help draw some attention from grown-ups who dont know the book but while the film may see enough success to justify follow-ups (Lowry has written three sequels) this franchise wont come close to competing with The Hunger Games and other more epic series. Thwaites plays Jonas who lives in a black-and-white world. Literally. Color unpredictable weather and interpersonal conflict have been carefully excised from the society he was born into -- an unnamed city-state set on a mesa ringed by clouds where identical dwellings house family units whose members aspire to perfect Sameness. Daily injections of passion-inhibiting drugs help in that quest as does a total ignorance of history. Memories of mankinds unruly past have been erased known only to a single Receiver of Memory (played by Bridges who appears to have filled his cheeks with cotton in search of the perfect grumbly-gruff Voice of Experience). Upon their ritualized graduation from childhood the Chief Elder (Streep) doles out appointed roles to Jonas and his peers. Good buddy Asher (Cameron Monaghan) will pilot one of the many flying drones that watch over citizens and politely inform them when theyre breaking a rule; sweet Fiona (Odeya Rush) will work in the Nurturing Center caring for newborns until they are sent off to be raised by host families. Jonas who already secretly realizes he sees things others cant will inherit the Receivers role studying with his predecessor until hes ready to advise the Elders in their decision-making. If much of Ed Verreauxs production design has a deliberately generic feel (check out those chunky white bicycles) the Receivers home office lives up to the revelations that will transpire there. An atrium-like library in a small stone bunker its built on ""The Edge"" It looks out on the cloud bank separating this world from Elsewhere the place (ahem) that old folks go when they have reached the end of their long productive careers. Here Bridges Receiver becomes the eponymous Giver sitting in mind-meld sessions with his pupil and allowing the young man to experience all the sensations and knowledge denied other citizens. This process of eye-opening is easily the films highlight and Thwaites is appropriately awestruck by his first telepathic encounters with color excitement and love. (In a much-hyped flashback-ish cameo Taylor Swift helps introduce Jonas to music.) If he doesnt see enough to grasp the depths of human experience the Elders have sacrificed for the sake of order Jonas learns of more direct cruelties. When he realizes that a not-physically-perfect baby with whom he has bonded is due to be ""released"" from the burden of existence he decides he must save this child from death and this community from its own perfection. Noyce is unsurprisingly capable in the short action sequence during which Jonas confronts his old schoolmates and makes his escape and while his ensuing trek through Elsewhere is barely a shadow of the journey Noyce chronicled in Rabbit-Proof Fence it makes good if quick use of daunting landscapes. But while Noyce is building suspense cutting between Jonas flight and the peril of his loved ones back home (Streep is wasted as the heavy enforcing conformity on those tempted to follow Jonas) the screenplay (credited to Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide) is preparing to let him down. With the exception of the psychic sessions between Jonas and the Giver everything about this scenario is grounded in the physical world; order is maintained not by some ancient magic but by technology pharmaceuticals and old-fashioned authoritarianism. But (no spoilers here) the hurdle Jonas eventually faces is more akin to the enchanted object that a wizard-battling hero can simply smash to break the spell enslaving his kingdom. Wham-bam no need for feel-good scenes of the peace he has brought to his fellow peasants. This easy out should go over especially badly with readers attached to the novels much more ambiguous end -- though to be fair audiences by now are so used to this type of nonsense that it hardly even registers. Like Jonas father -- Alexander Skarsgard who more than anyone in the cast finds a way to embody Sameness while being unmistakably human -- we moviegoers tend to accept what were told never knowing the peaks of feeling and intelligence we should really be demanding.

Sameness the conformist plague that afflicts the futuristic citizens of Lois Lowrys celebrated and scorned YA novel ""The Giver"" might also be the name given to what ails the movie adaptation -- the latest in a seemingly endless line of teen-centric dystopian fantasies that have become all but indistinguishable from one another. A longtime passion project for producer/star Jeff Bridges ""The Giver"" reaches the screen in a version that captures the essence of Lowrys affecting allegory but little of its mythic pull -- a recipe likely to disappoint fans while leaving others to wonder what all the fuss was about. Any hopes by co-producers the Weinstein Co. and Walden Media that they might have the next ""Hunger Games"" (or even ""Divergent"") on their hands look to be dashed by lackluster late-summer box office. Originally published in 1993 (six years before ""The Matrix"") Lowrys novel was itself a patchwork of ideas borrowed from Aldous Huxley George Orwell Jack Finney and Ray Bradbury in its depiction of totalitarian groupthink masquerading as peaceable utopia. The setting was an unnamed anywhere known only as ""the community"" whose residents had achieved a post-Platonic post-Marxist ideal of a classless conflict-free (and though not explicitly stated seemingly race-free) society through the chemical suppression of emotion and the erasure of all suspect stimuli (including books colors weather and sex) from the historical record. Exempt from this rigorous burning of the past was one man the Receiver of Memory a grizzled community elder charged with keeping all human experience from time immemorial catalogued inside his own understandably addled brain. If Lowrys ideas werent anything new to genre buffs or sociology majors what made her book so compulsively readable was the lucid simplicity of its prose and the surprising complexity of its arguments (especially for a novel aimed at children). Unlike a lot of speculative fiction ""The Giver"" wasnt a cautionary tale about nuclear or environmental apocalypse but rather an envisaging of the even greater horror show we might effect through our ostensibly best impulses to rid society of war famine and other forms of suffering. It was a highly adaptable metaphor for any form of organized rhetoric be it that of the religious right or the bleeding-heart left. And taking a page from J.D. Salinger Lowry didnt just suggest that most adults were duplicitous phonies but that they were capable of secretly murdering babies and the elderly without batting an eye. (Little wonder that ""The Giver"" was said to be banned from almost as many schools as made it compulsory reading.) In bringing the book to the screen director Phillip Noyce and screenwriters Michael Mitnick and Robert B. Weide have stayed reasonably faithful to the plot and characters while jettisoning much of the philosophical weight and making other perhaps inevitable concessions to commerce. A mere 12 years old on the page Lowrys nonconformist hero Jonas is here played by the 25-year-old Australian actor Brenton Thwaites while the incidental character of the communitys Chief Elder has been padded out into a ghoulish Nurse Ratched-esque villain role for Meryl Streep (who appears alternately in real and holographic form and seems equally disembodied in each). And with only partial success Noyce whos long been one of the best action directors around (""Patriot Games"" ""Clear and Present Danger"" ""Salt"") tries to turn Lowrys elegant open-ended climax into a large-scale setpiece involving speeding motorbikes drone aircraft and storm-trooper thugs rounding up dissidents into a Guantanamo-like prison. The movie begins well enough with our introduction to the community and its functional ""dwellings"" where Jonas lives with his dutiful but distant parents (Alexander Skarsgard and Katie Holmes) and younger sister Lily (Emma Tremblay). Working on a modest budget production designer Ed Verreaux and costume designer Diana Cilliers have given the film the spare modular look of mid-century modernism -- a feeling further enhanced by Noyces decision to shoot almost the entire first 30 minutes of the movie in low-contrast black-and-white with color only gradually seeping into the frames as Jonas learns to ""see beyond"" (a variation on the technique employed by the 1998 ""Pleasantville"" which itself may have been influenced by Lowry). From there ""The Giver"" goes on to chart the developing bond between the Receiver (Bridges) and Jonas who has been selected to inherit the great storehouse of memory and carry on the older mans legacy. The Receiver is Bridges in full-on stoner Buddha mode -- a routine the actor has done so many times now (most recently in ""Tron Legacy"") that it should have descended into self-parody. And yet Bridges is the most affecting thing in the movie -- a man physically and spiritually exhausted by having to carry the emotional weight of the world on his shoulders. The same unfortunately can not be said of Thwaites who barely registered as the young prince in ""Maleficent"" and makes even less of an impression here. As Jonas takes on ever more of the Receivers wisdom and experience hes meant to be shaken and stirred pushed to the very brink of psychological endurance but Thwaites plays it all with the same unwavering expression of sleepy dumbstruck awe more Harry Styles than Harry Potter. Elsewhere Israeli newcomer Odeya Rush flashes an entrancing come-hither stare but otherwise sets off few sparks as the unrequited object of Jonas proscribed affections (or ""stirrings"" as theyre known in community-speak) while country star Taylor Swift feels like the equivalent of human product placement in a thankless walk-on. But its hard to know what exactly to feel for Holmes whos casting as exactly the kind of dead-eyed Stepford wife the tabloids proffered during the TomKat years seems like someones idea of a cruel joke. This year at the movies has given us two superior dystopia tales -- ""The Lego Movie"" and ""Snowpiercer"" -- rich in the kind of real emotion ""The Giver"" talks about a lot but never achieves. Instead the more vibrant experience supposedly flows into the movie the more canned everything seems. In the novel Lowry conveyed the Receivers transmitted memories as indelible fragments of primal experience the feeling of sun and snow against bare skin; the suffering of an innocent animal; the aftermath of a bloody combat. Noyce gives us those sensations too but he isnt content to stop there amping up Jonas visions into frenetic montages of global chaos and togetherness that feel like a cross between a Microsoft ad and a Save the Children infomercial. Skydivers plummet from dizzying heights river rafters navigate raging rapids the Berlin Wall crumbles and Tiananmen Square revolts. All thats missing is a Peter Gabriel song.

Jekku says July 1 2016 at 738 pm ""Flaccid"" doesnt even begin to explain. Compared to the book this is an entirely different thing an extremely poor imitation. WTF Taylor Swift as Rosemary??? Ugh. That tells you all you need to know about this movie. It BARELY followed the book so much so that I had to just look at it as a completely other story. Didnt make me like it any better though. It moved way too fast it left out too many pieces and put in too many changes that it was nothing more than an annoyance just to watch it. I couldnt enjoy itcouldnt get into it couldnt connect to any of the characters. My advice DONT read the book before watching the movie - watch the movie as a completely separate story and dont even compare the two. Reply Carol threet says September 9 2015 at 552 pm I thought it was an excellent movie. Hope others see it and make up their own mind Reply Melanie says August 31 2014 at 846 am Being entirely populated by Caucasian people is not ""race-free"" - its one race. Caucasian IS a race. Reply Maria Foss says August 25 2014 at 741 pm I would call this review unnecessarily harsh. When my husband and I saw ""The Giver"" it was in the company of twenty-somethings who first encountered the book as required reading in middle school. They thought it a very faithful adaptation and seemed to approve of the casting particularly the choice of Jeff Bridges Husband and I (who had not previously read the book) likewise very much ""received"" the message the movie was sending in its rather emotive and understated way. Yes one can remark on the possible stunt casting of Katie Holmes as the mother in this movie yet somehow it works. I actually APPRECIATED the restraint in the story telling.. the apparent intentional stepping back from the concept of an evil dictator type set up for the audience love to hate for example. (Streeps Elder came across as more an opponent/antagonist than a straight up villain) Thus the ""Big Bad"" in this society was presented more indirectly and with more subtlety than commonly encountered in dystopian visions of the future. And as for the the stated flat sometimes passionless and for most of the film quite literally colorless character portrayals I believe theyre simply part of a point the movie was attempting to drive home. If this sort of thing bothers you during the course of a two hour film only imagine what it it must be like living in such a society Reply Susanna Austin says August 16 2014 at 950 pm The book was of course much better than the movie. However I did think this was a fantastic movie and that even though it was changed quite a bit it still held up and told a very important story. I think everybody should see it and make up their own minds. A+ and all that good jazz. Hopefully they make sequels Reply adria259 says August 13 2014 at 928 am Reblogged this on Screens amp; Writers. Reply Nora knob says August 12 2014 at 1258 pm The male lead seems out of his depth not sure why theres any buzz about him he lacks charisma or acting abilities. Plus it has taylor swift in it which is not enticing frankly.
