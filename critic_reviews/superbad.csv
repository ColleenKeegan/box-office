Goodbye Friday nights chugging Old Milwaukees in their parents furnished basements; hello getting shitfaced in the company of a few dozen of their not particularly close friends. More importantly having completed their independent study in Internet porn our heroes finally get the chance to put their virtual carnal knowledge to practical use. Provided that is they can actually get to the party.Yes Superbad is about one of those nights--when you finally have the chance to prove that youre not as big of a dork as everyone thinks only to be chased by the cops hit by a car (twice) and nearly pulverized by the dude whose girlfriends menstrual blood somehow ends up on your pant leg as well as to drunkenly embarrass yourself in front of the one girl you have real feelings for. You know one of those nights. But Im getting a little ahead of myself.For starters Superbad was written by Knocked Up star Seth Rogen and co-writer Evan Goldberg who cooked up the first draft of the script when they were in high school--which helps to explain why the movie feels so knowing in every one of its clumsily averted glances and frank discussions of things like the best way to camouflage an erection. Rogen and Goldberg even named the lead characters after themselves though a few drafts later they are equally recognizable as specimens bred in the Apatow gene pool--the sort of kids you knew in high school or maybe were yourself who seem a touch young for their age who are more book smart than street smart and who live in abject terror at the thought of going off to college with their virginity intact.More geek than freak chubby motor-mouthed Seth (Jonah Hill) perpetually brings up the rear in gym class and gets spat on by the resident senior-class bully while gangly soft-spoken Evan (Michael Cera)--who can run like the wind but doesnt really get the point of things like sports--stands dutifully at his side an introspective Sancho to his brash Quixote. True to form they pine for girls who seem out of their respective leagues Evan for nice-girl Becca (Martha MacIsaac) whose obvious flirtations he cluelessly rebuffs; Seth for the comely Jules (Emma Stone). Then the act of divine intervention pairs Seth and Jules in a home-economics project and results in the popular girl inviting the dork (and his dork friend) to her graduation party. But as mentioned getting to that hallowed place proves easier said than done. In fact it turns into something like the Lord of the Rings of adolescent nookie movies--a calamitous hazard-filled journey toward the fiery gates of Mount Poon.At 19 and 23 respectively Cera and Hill have the fully developed comic timing of seasoned pros--Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in sneakers and cargo shorts. Yet Superbad is routinely stolen right out from under them by an 18-year-old newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse who was plucked from MySpace obscurity to play the unapologetically dweeby third wheel Fogell and who embraces the part with such unbridled comic brio that the character--and his fake-ID alias McLovin--is bound for movie-comedy immortality. Following a hilariously botched attempt by our intrepid trio to buy booze using said ID Superbad effectively splits along two parallel tracks as Seth and Evan navigate their own circuitous route to Juless house while Fogell/McLovin winds up getting an unexpected lift from two police officers (played by Rogen and Saturday Night Lives Bill Hader) who make the Keystone Kops look like paragons of law and order.Directed by Greg Mottola (an alumnus like Hill of Apatows short-lived TV series Undeclared) Superbad is duly ribald and often achingly funny brewed from the now-familiar Apatow house blend of go-for-broke slapstick and instantly quotable potty-mouthed dialogue. (""Im so jealous you got to suck on those tits when you were a baby"" a wistful Seth tells Evan after an encounter with his friends amply bosomed mother.) But what sets Superbad far apart from the American Pie series--indeed what earns it a place alongside American Graffiti Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Dazed and Confused in that elite strata of high-school comedies destined to stand the test of time--is its sweet soulful vulnerability particularly as it becomes clear that the only thing Seth and Evan feel more anxious about than losing their virginity is the thought of losing each other in the fall when they head off to separate colleges. That naughty-but-nice approach might seem something of an Apatow cliche by now if the characters themselves didnt ring so true. Make no mistake Superbad is a movie about getting wasted and getting laid but it is above all an ode to the end of teenage innocence in all its wonderful horrible splendor.

So swept up by their good fortune are these dorky best buds -- porn-obsessed Seth (Jonah Hill) and shy Dartmouth-bound Evan (Michael Cera) -- that they promise to bring the booze and ... well you know where this is headed right? Into Porkys-by-way-of- Fast-Times-at-American- Pie-High territory. Its alcohol-fueled potty- mouthed gross -- and as centrally sweet as youll expect once you note Judd Apatows name in the producer credits. The director of The 40-Year-Old Virgin here allows his favorite freaks and geeks to explore the mindset of the 18-year-old virgin. Knocked Up star Seth Rogen and his writer buddy Evan Goldberg reportedly started working on this script when they were 13 which doubtless explains the many penis jokes theyve given the on-screen Seth and Evan. But what makes the film so appealing is the disconnect between what comes from the mouths of these hormone-addled pups and whats going on in their heads where theyre still clinging desperately to the innocence theyre leaving behind.

"Review Superbad funniest comedy since Borat - CNN.com Review Superbad funniest comedy since BoratStory Highlights ""Superbad"" a high school sex comedy taken to great extremes High schoolers go in search of booze sex -- but it works Film co-written by ""Knocked Ups"" Seth Rogen produced by Judd ApatowNext Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- With ""Superbad"" producer Judd Apatow (""Knocked Up"" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") has created another cockeyed hit. In ""Superbad"" Michael Cera (left) and Jonah Hill (right) go in search of a teens holy grail booze and sex. The hilarious film offers a younger skew on what must be labeled the Apatow house brand of touchy-feely sex comedy -- in other words more extreme profanity and juvenile gross-out gags. But all that doesnt make ""Superbad"" bad. Far from it -- this is the funniest picture since ""Borat"" and more emotionally nuanced than you would expect. Not that you would expect much in that line I imagine. Penned by ""Knocked Up"" star Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg when they were still in high school ""Superbad"" has what screenwriting gurus call a ""quest"" narrative through a combination of chance and opportunism Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera from ""Arrested Development"") are entrusted with securing the alcohol for an end-of-term party. ""You know how when girls sleep with guys they always say it was an accident?"" reasons Seth optimistically. ""We could be that accident"" Watch Cera and Hill offer tales from the film >> His plan hinges on their even nerdier pal Fogell (unheralded comedy superhero Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Fogell has a fake ID lined up. Trouble is when this document materializes it carries only the single name ""McLovin"" officially a 25-year-old organ donor from the Aloha State. Undeterred brave ""McLovin"" ventures into a liquor store only to get caught up in an attempted robbery. In the movies quirkiest detour he spends most of the evening cruising in a patrol car with two unexpectedly paternal party-hearty cops (Rogen and Bill Hader). Meanwhile Seth and Evan gamely try to parlay a traffic accident into hard booze. Anyone even remotely schooled in teen comedy will recognize that ""Superbad"" is an old old story albeit one that seems unreasonably determined to lower the taste bar. Each generation throws up a coming-of-age comedy to call its own whether its ""American Graffiti"" or ""American Pie"" and there are equal parts of both here. Fogell could be the son (or the grandson) of Charles Martin Smiths Terry the Toad from the Lucas film. (Theres also a blast of the Bar-Kays ""Soul Finger"" on the predominantly funk soundtrack.) Mostly though were reminded that Seth Rogens association with Judd Apatow goes all the way back to the cult NBC series ""Freaks and Geeks"" when he was 16. ""Superbad"" could be an R-rated episode from that show. Although it takes place over 24 hours or so the films period is a bit hazy. These geeks dont talk about sports. They dont talk about music or movies (hardly) ... or politics (as if). They certainly dont talk about whatever it is theyre learning in high school (in Seths case apparently not much). Sometimes they talk about girls. But thats just an important but not vital adjunct to the real Topic A the penis. The male sex organ and its potential applications are contemplated endlessly inside and out with Seth and Evan turning ideas over in their minds with the same mixture of curiosity creativity and awe scientists dedicate to quantum physics and basketball fans reserve for the career of Steve Nash. Of course such overheated bravado is utterly transparent. Seventeen-year-old virgins they are distressingly ignorant when it comes to the opposite sex and terrified of the mystery that lurks there. Directing his first feature since the indie gem ""The Daytrippers"" Greg Mottola takes care to ground the improbable plot in a realistic low-rent neighborhood and authentic characterizations. If the guileless Mintz-Plasse steals the show Cera and Hill play off each other beautifully. The intentionally and hilariously anti-climactic ending crystallizes the movies fairly subtle emotional subtext. Soon it will be time to put aside childish things and for Seth and Evan this includes each other. ""Superbad"" is rated R and runs 114 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

Superbad stars Michael Cera and Jonah Hill (the tubby one from Knocked Up) as two high school seniors preoccupied with alcohol virginity parties and the transition to college. Hardly an unprecedented set-up - Dazed and Confused and American Pie come most quickly to mind - but like its stablemates the picture is delivered with unusually high levels of both belly laughs and emotional affect. Gross-out is exploited - and how - but shaded with and put to the service of self-awareness fellow-feeling and regret.The film is produced by Apatow co-written by Knocked Up lead Seth Rogen and directed by Greg Mottola whose TV work has included Undeclared with Apatow and Arrested Development with Cera. Working their pre-existing personae Hill and Cera make a charmingly geeky odd couple though third stooge Christopher Mintz-Plasse threatens to steal the movie as the uber-nerd who falls in with a pair of puerile cops (including Rogen in a handlebar moustache) by dint of a preposterous fake ID identifying him simply as McLovin.If these scenes set themselves a lower bar than the unassumingly deft character work of the main story with its lively attention to adolescent anxieties Superbad at its best goes right through knockabout to land in deliciously obscene places - notably a staggering succession of doodles in which tumescent cocks take on various extraordinary guises. Crafted with such deliriously pain-staking care as to defy offence they stand for a film a group of films defining the difference between vulgarity and crassness.

Instead it was a gesture of supreme confidence. ""Superbad"" turns out to achieve if not a seamless goodness at least an insistently funky fun. Since the time they were pups Evan and Seth planned to attend the same college. Along the way Evan (Michael Cera) became a lanky thoughtful overachiever while Seth (Jonah Hill) became a roly-poly with the stevedores mouth. Now Evan is headed to Dartmouth where he will (or wont) room with fellow senior and super-oddster Fogell. Seth will decidedly not be scaling any Ivy towers. Written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg ""Superbad"" is knowing about the fondness between straight teen guys that dare not speak its name. Asked by Evans mom if theyll miss each other the guys hem haw and shrug off the import of their long-term attachment. A quest for the unholy grail of senior-bash liquor tests their friendship. It also allows Apatow to tease the braggadoccio and butterflies the randiness and readiness of teen sexuality introducing two lust interests into the mix. Evan promises a bottle of vodka to Becca (Martha MacIsaac). Seth plans to fuel Jules (Emma Stone) whole senior shindig. Their funny familiar misadventure also finds a nearly indelible character in their quasi-friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Or should we say McLovin? That is the moniker more dopey than dope that Fogell takes for his fake ID. And good luck getting it out of your noggin. ""Like Seal?"" shouts an incredulous Seth outside a liquor store. (Actually it sounds suspiciously like a swipe at McG director of the ""Charlies Angels"" flicks.) After a robbery McLovin becomes the pet project of police officers Slater and Michaels (played by Bill Hader and co-writer Rogen). They promise to drop him off after they reply to an emergency call and then another and another. The pair in blue are armed and dangerously adolescent. And the scripts canniest observations come as it tosses McLovin into the back of their cruiser and sends Evan and Seth on a party run with a suspect stranger. ""Superbad"" reminds its target audience theres authentic just-passing-through adolescence and then theres stunted growth. Rogen and Hader have a great time making the latter point. Hills porn-icating spouting-off Seth bears the burden and the naughtiest pleasures of proving the former. Hill has a John Belushi quality. And its not because of his heft so much as his physical-comedy courage. He inhabits Seths girth and gall with prickly bravado and quiet desperation. Yet his characters foul mouth threatens to scorch his appeal. In making Seth so exhaustingly crude the filmmakers risk scuttling the films resolution. A similar doubt arose with Apatows ""Knocked Up"" (though there was something winning about Rogens character Ben). Do beautiful girls really have such awful taste that all is forgotten at the slightest inkling of emotional growth? Its a nice fantasy for someone. From its title to a reliance on ""Super Fly""-style grooves ""Superbad"" plies urban cultural cachet. And the filmmakers are fully aware of the irony. ""Were gonna get our drinks on chickee chickee"" says the goofiest character. So another treatise on the ongoing commodification of black funk for white-bread masses can wait. However a critical mass of these kinds of flicks argues for a new subgenre ""nerdsploitation."" As long as a generation of filmmakers with visas for the hip-hop nation make comedies there will be plenty of chances to consider the ongoing miscegenation of geek and gangsta. Still having Seth sport a Richard Pryor T-shirt doesnt exactly grant a free pass to be crude rude and as nasty as you wanna be. But it does provide a hint about where the films badmouthing roots lie. So a caveat From here on out when you read in ad copy or hear in trailers ""from the makers of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up"" prepare yourself for a mix of the inspired and tired the hormonally true and the scatologically lazy. Otherwise you may peel out of the multiplex as a couple of women behind me did in the midst of a recent preview screening. If you stay - prepared to hear almost every profane synonym for bodily fluids and sex acts - you may have some bawdy brash fun.

"Gimme some McLovin | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGimme some McLovinTheres a perfectly good reason why some of the most memorable teen-themed movies tend to take place largely over the course of a single night a night in adolescence can not only last an eternity it can be the pivot that either catapults you into adulthood or condemns you to a life of terminally arrested nostalgia.Super-nerd Christopher Mintz-Plasse left a.k.a. ""McLovin"" joins Jonah Hill and Michael Cera to plan a memorable night in Superbad.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Aug. 17 2007Starring Jonah Hill Michael Cera Christopher Mintz-Plasse Seth Rogen Bill Hader and Martha MacIsaac. Written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Directed by Greg Mottola. 114 minutes. At major theatres. 14ANothing if not memorable and at the very least an instant cult item Greg Mottolas Superbad traces the Odyssean dusk-to-dawn odyssey of two chronically over-stimulated dweebs - Jonah Hills hyperventilating horndog Seth and Michael Ceras almost ethereally winsome Evan - as they attempt to procure some booze for a party thrown by the girls who play starring roles in their web-porn-fed hormonal reveries. Explaining that liquor is a vital element in inducing chicks to make mistakes theyll later regret Seth makes his pitch ""We could be that mistake""Initially written by the not coincidentally named Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg when they were teens the sometimes startlingly vulgar-but-smart Superbad straddles both predominant strains of teen-movie orientation. Its got the insiders view of male adolescent pathology nailed but it also takes the longer perspective offered by a certain amount of ""adult"" distance - in the end its about the fading of fleeting unconditional guy/guy friendships. While this probably accounts for the somewhat overstressed narrative presence of two rehab-bound cops (played by Rogen and SNLs Bill Hader) who are unnervingly stuck in their own Star Wars-stained adolescence it also permits the movie to be wise and wacko in equal measure. Im not sure when the last time was I found myself touched by a film with such graphic gags about menstrual stains and compulsive penis-doodling but I suspect its been since never.While the after-dark lets-get-laid suburban epic plot is both entirely familiar and dramatically skimpy it permits the movie to wallow in incident and fine-tuned character eccentricity both of which it does to sometimes startling effect.Article Continued BelowAlong with newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse who single-handedly revitalizes the mega-nerd stereotype as the guy whose fake Hawaiian I.D. bears the single name ""McLovin"" both Hill and Cera are miraculously dissimilar studies in post-pubescent obliviousness. Theres the former with his hopelessly hysterical little-head perspective on the world and the latter so prone to distraction he doesnt even notice when the girl he lusts after practically asks him on a date. Make no mistake Superbad contains laughs galore so many that the last one may get in the way of next one coming. But its also got moments where you may want to cover your eyes to shield yourself from the sheer wince-inducing familiarity of the behaviour on display.There is no shortage of teen movies that try to make us love them by catering to our ideal fantasies of the way we wish we might have been. Superbad succeeds with a radically different and considerably riskier strategy by appealing to our embarrassed acknowledgment of just how hopeless we actually were.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The movie is supposed to be the story of how they fall in love and into shared responsibility. But the scene with the deepest communion of personalities is when the Rogen character gets high in a Vegas motel room with ... Heigls brother-in-law. Today we have the summers last major comedy Superbad produced by Apatow and co-written by Rogen. Its about a pudgy mouthy slob named Seth (Jonah Hill) and his quieter slightly more kempt buddy Evan (Michael Cera) who want with variously intense degrees of desperation to get laid before they graduate from high school. At the end of a night of wacky hijinks the lads do wind up in a sleeping bag exchanging intimacies with...each other. Why dont Apatow and Rogen just do the honorable thing and tell the world theyre gay? It would save them a lot of time wasted pretending their movies are about young men growing up and finding the right young woman. It would also save movie critics from having to find new ways of saying about their maxi-raunch comedies ""Oh but at heart theyre really sweet."" And while Hollywood is being honest about the new strain of guy-meets-guy comedy -- bromance the word writer Dave Carnie coined to describe the strong emotional attachment of one man for another -- maybe Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler should come out of the closet too. In Ferrells movies male merging beats female interest to a pulp and his latest Blades of Glory allows him several opportunities to stick his face in Jon Heders crotch. Sandlers summer hit I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry took guy-guy friendship to its logical conclusion two firefighters get married. At least that seemed as far as boy-meets-boy comedies could go until Superbads cuddle-up scene. And yet there may be one more border to cross. When Apatow appeared last week on The Colbert Report and was asked what was possibly left to show in male comedies he instantly answered ""A penis."" I dont doubt that Apatow was speaking ironically yet there was self-revelation there to since thats exactly the sexual organ that the fellows in Knocked Up and Superbad (and his earlier The 40-Year-Old Virgin) are most obsessed by. I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU JUDD AND SETH Im in a pretty small minority of critics who arent enchanted by the Apatow movies. The first four reviews I read online this morning of Superbad all by women in the New York and L.A. Timeses and the Washington and New York Posts ranged from favorable to ecstatic. Manohla Dargis notice in the New York Times described the films phallo-neurosis with a gusto that soared into poetry ""If the penis is puzzled in Portnoys Complaint as Alexander Portnoys shrink believes in Superbad it is thoroughly stunningly clueless and as violently tremulous as a divining rod at Hoover Dam."" (Congrats to Manohla by the way for getting shrink and penis into the same sentence.) The token male critic I consulted Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal was just as enthusiastic this ""bawdy big-hearted"" comedy is a ""canny evocation of male friendship in all its richness and complexity."" Its as if all these worthy scribes have the rapture and Im left behind.

Starring Jonah Hill Michael Cera Seth Rogen Bill Hader and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Directed by Greg Mottola. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For pure laughs for the experience of just sitting in a chair and breaking up every minute or so ""Superbad"" is 2007s most successful comedy. Other comedies - such as Judd Apatows ""Knocked Up"" and Adrienne Shellys ""Waitress"" - have been more ambitious and in some ways more satisfying. But nothing onscreen this year has been as funny as this. This is laugh-out-loud stuff a real giddy pleasure. Its a high school comedy and the humor is sometimes crude but the impulse behind the humor isnt crude at all. Behind its bits ""Superbad"" is loaded with genuine and truthful observations about what its like to be a high school senior to have the mind of an adult and the judgment of a house plant to have tremendous longings and yet no power - to be at an age when just buying a six-pack requires the detailed planning of a master criminal. ""Superbad"" captures the hardships of being that age and the magic too - the way that one party can hold all the promise of the universe or a single night can open up into a series of astounding adventures. It mainly deals with what its like to be a guy that age the embarrassing agonies the stupidities and the ecstasies. But an unexpected virtue of ""Superbad"" is that it has sensitivity for the girls point of view as well. Though we mostly see the boys the girls are drawn with a specificity of detail that allows us to see them as complete people even if the boys view them as awe-inspiring and mysterious abstractions. Produced by Apatow directed by Greg Mottola (""The Daytrippers"") and written by Seth Rogen (""Knocked Up"") and Evan Goldberg the movie was cast with a sophisticated eye for young comic talent. In the lead roles as best friends it places the rotund and voluble Jonah Hill and the slim and watchful Michael Cera who at 19 already has unique comic timing and a masterful dry delivery. Seth (Hill) and Evan (Cera) - the characters are named after the screenwriters - are approaching the end of senior year without having had a great romance. Theyre bemoaning their lot in life and then an opportunity comes their way. Theyre invited to a party. The only hitch is that theyre entrusted with buying all the liquor for the party and neither of them has a fake ID. Most of ""Superbad"" tells the story of their efforts to buy the liquor and get to the party. Sounds simple enough. It isnt. To make the purchase theyre forced to deal with the one guy they would not want to involve the incredibly nerdy Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who happens to have a fake ID. Fogell is an arresting character in that hes more than the usual squeaky-voiced nerd. Hes sly and arch and has a peculiar self-possession. Hes a marvelous comic creation - Mintz-Plasse is an equally marvelous comedic find - and about a third of the movie follows Fogells adventures as the liquor purchase goes bizarrely awry. Rogen and Bill Hader show up as a pair of small-town cops who are no more mature than the high school boys and they take Fogell under their wing as their best buddy. They have some of the funniest scenes. The party following a long buildup finds more opportunities for laughs. And the casting of Emma Stone and Martha MacIsaac as the objects of Seth and Evans respective affections is particularly fortuitous in that neither is a clear teen-movie archetype (prom queen cheerleader nice girl). Theyre as quirky and interesting as the boys. Underlying ""Superbad"" is anxiety about the future. Soon Seth and Evan will be going off to different colleges and they know their friendship will never be this exclusive or intense again. At the same time they desperately want to enter the female universe and the movie suggests with a touch of wistfulness that once they enter this world theyll never leave - and that gaining something is going to mean losing something. ""Superbad"" - while not sentimental and while never overvaluing this boys world (or undermining its occasional ridiculousness) - is a tribute to the thing thats lost. -- Advisory This film contains strong language substance abuse and sexual situations.

For me it could have been a little shorter and Jonah Hill who plays the genres archetypal foul-mouthed self-debasing loser could have been reined in a bit. But the teenager in me has kept up with the liberating trend of unisex locker-room humor - as in ""American Pie"" the female leads talk dirty too - and this hormonal answer to ""Reefer Madness"" is good wacked-out fun. ""Superbads"" trio of virginal nerds are Hills chubby curly-haired Seth Michael Ceras soft-spoken Evan and Christopher Mintz-Plasses Fogell a nearsighted gawky wimp whose character - nicknamed McLovin - makes the films funniest turn. ""Superbad"" follows the boys for one day and night as they try to round up booze for a party being thrown by Seths beautiful seemingly unattainable lab partner Jules (Emma Stone). Seth figures if he can get Jules drunk he can lose his virginity with a memory that will last a lifetime. Evan is merely hoping to get over his shyness and act on his mutual attraction for classmate Becca (Martha MacIsaac). The first half of the movie is mostly concerned with the trios panicked attempts to fulfill their assigned role of supplying booze for the entire party and with Seths nonstop riff on the amount and variations of sex hes going to get in return. Through a series of hilariously unlikely events Fogells fake Hawaiian ID lands him in the middle of a liquor store robbery then in the backseat of a patrol car operated by the two nuttiest cops in the Los Angeles Police Department. Officers Slater and Michaels are played respectively by Bill Hader of ""Saturday Night Live"" and Seth Rogen of ""Knocked Up"" who also co-wrote the script. These guys love McLovin and haul him around with them - sharing beers letting him shoot their guns and giving him sexual secrets not apt to do him any good. There is a hint of sentimentality among the pals at the end but not enough to offset the films harmless combination of camaraderie and wished-for - oh how they wish for it - debauchery.

Photo Melissa Moseley Columbia Pictures Superbad 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Seth has a thing for Jules. Evan has a thing for Becca. Fogell has two things one for a girl in a thong the other a fake drivers license that identifies him as a 25-year-old Hawaiian named McLovin. When Jules (Emma Stone) invites Seth (Jonah Hill) to a party at her house he mentions the fake I.D. She asks him to buy alcohol. Thrilled Seth and Evan (Michael Cera) meet Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) after school and venture off to purchase liquor which they figure they can then use to souse Jules and Becca (Martha MacIsaac) until theyre pliant little sex machines. The plan Get booze get girls drunk get some. Unfortunately Seth panics at the supermarket. Then Fogell gets clocked by a robber at the liquor store sparking the arrival of two wildly unscrupulous cops (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader). They spend the rest of the film corrupting Fogell in almost every way that Fogell could possibly be corrupted. Seth spends the rest of the film getting hit by cars and his own misguided manhood. Evan an intermittent voice of reason winds up singing from the Guess Who catalog to a roomful of violent cokeheads. You can look at Superbad one of two ways. Its either a genius-touched stream-of-conscious- ness odyssey about young men in pursuit of an elusive ideal -- something James Joyce might have written after a long night downloading porn -- or approximately two hours of penis humor. It all depends on your age mood tolerance for five-alarm profanity and quite possibly gender. But even this middle-age hausfrau can appreciate the zonkered comic force behind Superbad whose rambling plot and profane bull sessions reminded me of Danny Leiners Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle. If you missed that one it was another Joycean odyssey about young men (in this case highly stoned young men) in pursuit of hamburgers. Directed by Arrested Development scribe Greg Mottola Superbad marks his first feature film since 1996s flaky but endearing indie-road pic The Daytrippers. Hes joined in the credits by several of the ribald folks who made The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. In Superbad Hill exploits his startled-goober countenance while Mintz-Plasse an 18-year-old newcomer with a squeaking nebbishy magnetism steals every scene hes in. Most of the funniest bits I cant even begin to describe much less quote but prepare yourself for body fluids (some projectile others ferrous) and naked-phallus artwork that re-imagines scenes from the Titanic and Tiananmen Square. The dialogue offers a nonstop stream of F-words and S-words and D-words and so on through the alphabet a blue-mouthed exposition on sex and the teenage boy. But its more about desire and the teenage boy -- the raw experience of wanting badly until the entire world shrinks to only a few body parts and one major function. Parents have no part in this; just one makes a cameo and even then the cameras preoccupied with her breasts. But just like Knocked Up -- just like Virgin -- Mottolas film boasts a shocking streak of good-old-fashioned moral discretion. Theres a bashfulness about it a downy reluctance to do the wrong thing no matter which classic funk songs are playing on the soundtrack. The leching young men of Superbad arent so bad after all. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals GoPlus Racing Style Executive Chair for 80 + free shipping Samsung 65"" Curved 4K Smart TV 400 Dell GC for 1500 + free...

"Its a nerd hes in pain -- its Superbad - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review Its a nerd hes in pain -- its Superbad Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) at work. Top right Seth Rogan as Officer Michaels. (Melissa Moseley/Columbia Pictures) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  August 17 2007 American movies generally want us to do more than like a character. They want us to root for him.This necessitates charm wit humility talent a handsome face something. A few movies take a characters likability for granted as though his very circumstances are enough to make us root for him as though the act of cheering on a character will make us love him. It should really be the other way around Affection should inspire support.""Superbad"" is one of those movies that has this backward. It assumes that the desperate adolescent boys quest for sex is so universal that wed root for anybody to score regardless of whether we love the kids in pursuit. The movie wants us to cheer on husky Seth (Jonah Hill) and noodly Evan (Michael Cera) in a quest to buy alcohol for a big party where God willing two girls will take their virginity.The ecstatically amused audience I saw it with didnt have any problem loving the movie or anticipating these two losing it. But I was never sufficiently seduced. I didnt like Seth and couldnt rouse myself to root for him. Needless to say it was a lonely two hours.Set in a virtually unparented American everyburb ""Superbad"" has a degree more sophistication than ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""American Pie"" and less than the underrated ""House Party."" Its just as ribald as all of them. The movie spends a couple of days and one long night with Seth and Evan in the months before they leave for college. Their plan never to be apart has been upended since only Evan got into Dartmouth and the movies emotional subtext very much involves Seths heartbreak over the possible loss of his best friend.""Superbad"" emerges from the increasingly successful happy comedy family whose central figure is Judd Apatow. He wrote and directed ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and produced this movie. The writers are Evan Goldberg and ""Knocked Up"" star Seth Rogen childhood friends whove named the characters after themselves. Director Greg Mottola has overseen some excellent canceled TV series including ""Arrested Development"" and Apatows own ""Undeclared.""""Superbad"" has some of that Apatow feeling. The few smart observations could have come from an episode of one of his TV shows. But the movie is missing the gentle moral authority and most of the human warmth. (There is one affectionate moment between Seth and Evan in a sleeping bag that suggests a suburban ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and one disagreement between them evokes the wounded spats in Barry Levinsons ""Diner."") ""Superbad"" also lacks a funny woman or at least some female perspective -- it would have been nice to hear what the girls see in these boys. The filmmakers are much more interested in Seths combustibility. He is explosively vulgar. The camera gets in close on his face as he screams frustrated obscenities at whomever. Humiliation (once hes bled on; twice hes hit by a car) only seems to make him worse. His unpopular status in school seems warranted Hes toxic and selfish.""Superbad"" belongs to that family of horny-misfit movies -- outcast boys want to hook up with cool girls but theyve been too preoccupied with their obsessions to have learned how. But sex has been Seths nerdy obsession and he is pathological about every aspect of it. In explaining his contempt for the girl Evan likes Seth tells a story which the movie dramatizes about how years ago she glimpsed one of his copious penis drawings. His phallophilia appears to have inspired his misogyny. That the movie knows the character is a lech doesnt make him any more fun.Hill who looks older than a high school senior has had small parts of a similar vein in ""Knocked Up"" and ""Evan Almighty."" He was like a condiment in those movies. A little went a long enjoyable way. As the star of his own film hes a bowl of mustard. He has Albert Brookss defensive sense of superiority (and a version of his wild curly hair) but he rarely gets to express that superiority as wit. It comes out in the form of breathless exclamatory expletives.When I laughed at Hill it was when he was given something remotely printable to say. (He has a very funny line about manual sex camouflage and Vietnam.) But its hard to build an entire movie around his kind of negativity. And as sweetly funny as Cera is in letting some of his lines just trail off unfinished (he was underrated as Jason Batemans son on ""Arrested Development"") hes not substantial enough a presence to wrest the movie away from Hill.The filmmakers take breaks from these two to give us time with Seth and Evans extremely geeky buddy Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who after a mishap purchasing liquor with a fake ID spends the movie riding along with a pair of reckless nincompoop cops played by Rogen and Bill Hader. These scenes are tiresome and unpleasant (they look like theyve been shot through beer goggles) but Mintz-Plasse has great comic style. He whines and wheezes his lines with a kind of broken musicality and his face is often caught making an expression somewhere between shock and a sneeze.As films about the young and the horny go I preferred the smarter approach director Jeffrey Blitz takes in ""Rocket Science"" a comedy that also opens here today. ""Superbad"" feels confused by comparison. Its an R-rated film with the simple sensibility of a show that might play on the teen cable channel The N. But its also thoroughly entrenched in a retrograde adolescence that keeps slipping outside teen comedy into the territory of the horror film. ""American Pie"" whose makers tried to give their inexperienced lads some carnal knowledge did the same thing It turned sex into something youd expect to see in ""The Exorcist.""""Superbad"" comes up with mysterious menstrual blood pre-coital puking violently possessive 30-something cokeheads and terrified reaction shots to it all. I wanted to find this as funny as audiences did. But it mostly made me understand the case for staying a virgin until youre 40.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Intermittently hilarious if also interminable the film is about guys who get sloppy drunk one night and on the morning after see the errors of excess. What distinguishes Superbad produced by Judd Apatow (Knocked Up) from most other teen comedies about backward boys trying to be sexually forward is that instead of losing their virginity they gain emotional maturity. For many seniors including the class clown nerd and geek at the center of this raucous raunchfest the need to leave home is as urgent as the need not to leave friends. Looming over those is that Hollywood-imposed third need to lose virginity by graduation. Clownish Seth (Jonah Hill) and nerdy Evan (Michael Cera) are best buds their bond forged by years of social exclusion. The potty-mouthed extrovert and soft-spoken introvert are the guys generally not invited to the party. Their fortunes improve when A1/4berbabe Jules (Emma Stone) asks Seth to her bash - and will he buy the booze? Evans excited because his crush Becca (Martha MacIsaac) makes plans to see him there. The codependent chums are so jazzed just by being asked that they dont think through how to purchase the firewater. Enter the geek Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) - so screechy and scrawny that he makes misfits Seth and Evan look popular - proffering a fake I.D. What ensues is a night of tension and terror - imagine the sexual and social humiliations of American Pie crossed with the Kafkaesque detours of After Hours - and a test of friendship and character. Written by Seth Rogen (the Knocked Up star who appears here as a cop) and Evan Goldberg (who reportedly started writing the script when they were 13) Superbad has main characters who share the names of their creators. They draw fine (and funny) distinctions between these high school losers. And they wittily measure the enormous gap between the guy who thinks hes talking cool and the listeners who hear him as clueless. Although Seth and Evan wouldnt put it this way the two young men discover in life as in love everyone else feels just as insecure and awkward as you do. In other words love makes everyone a nerd. Because the screenwriters and director Greg Mottola (maker of the underappreciated The Daytrippers) are so identified with (and affectionate toward) the characters their film raunchy as it is generates a great deal of goodwill. And a great deal of impatience. Mottola lets every scene run on too long. Apparently he is unaware that brevity is comedys secret ingredient. Probably not since Y Tu Mama Tambien has a movie taken such a close look at the dynamics of male friendship including its homosocial subtext. Here its not a woman who threatens to come between the protagonists but a male friend. Fogell like Evan is bound for Dartmouth; Seth is headed to State and regards Fogell with the contempt and jealousy of a rival suitor for his beloveds affections. As for the films extended subplot involving Fogell and party-hearty cops (Rogen and Bill Hader) he encounters at the liquor store I wouldnt be surprised if the Fraternal Order of Police put Superbad on its most-hated list.

The cause of Daniels immediate distress is obvious -- its the day of his fathers funeral and here is the undertaker with the wrong corpse. ""Wrong"" is the operative word with ""Death at a Funeral"" which in the first very funny 30 minutes shows its hand and then unfortunately continues to wave that hand frantically for the next hour. In one of the movies few successful running jokes the wrong fellow -- would-be writer Daniel -- is slated to deliver the eulogy. Really shouldnt it be his brother Robert (Rupert Graves) a self-centered best-selling novelist? A niece of the deceased gives her fiance what she thinks is a Valium to blunt his panic at meeting the clan; in fact the pill is a powerful hallucinogenic. Worst of all a mysterious guest (Peter Dinklage) threatens to besmirch the reputation and memory of the deceased (and couldnt the screenwriter have come up with a better fresher scandal?) unless his terms are met. Ah if only blackmail were the worst of this interlopers offenses. ""I tried writing once"" he observes after checking out a few pages of Daniels novel-in-progress. ""It didnt work for me either."" ENLARGE There is throughout much locking and slamming of doors broad physical humor ever-escalating skirmishes between family members and this being England plenty of bathroom humor. But whatever head of steam ""Death at a Funeral"" gathers is dissipated by the repetitive predictable jokes and by the cowardice of its sugary ending. Superbad Gross-out jokes the rat-a-tat spewing of obscenities and the ever-so-colorful expressions that describe certain secondary sexual characteristics and certain intimate acts -- theyre the high octane fueling contemporary comedies aimed at adolescent boys. But sweetness? Not so much. Which brings us to the subject of the wonderful ""Superbad"" a movie that shares its bawdy big-hearted DNA with ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up."" Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) -- the characters are named for ""Superbad"" screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg -- are lifelong boon companions and state-of-the-art nerds who are about to graduate from high school and go their separate ways. The skinny gentle and socially inept Evan who has worn a deep groove in the straight and narrow is headed for Dartmouth; the economy-sized potty-mouthed Seth is headed for oblivion. An unexpected invitation to a party at the house of cool girl Jules (Emma Stone) gets Seth and Evan fantasizing -- maybe theyll get drunk maybe theyll get lucky -- and sets off a chain of events that tests their alcohol tolerance and their relationship. A hilarious -- if slightly protracted -- intersecting plot involves the boys super-twerp friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse in a terrific debut) and a couple of policemen (Mr. Rogen and Bill Hader) with a very elastic interpretation of civic responsibility. The business about the fake I.D. -- funny; the liquor store holdup -- very very funny; the tutorial on fooling the Breathalyzer -- funnier still. But whats most memorable most striking about ""Superbad"" is the canny evocation of male friendship in all its richness and complexity. The Invasion Look at them the residents of Washington D.C. moving down the street like sleepwalkers. Civil servants beaten down by the bureaucracy? Elected officials worn down by Senate probes and the 24-hour news cycle? If only. At the beginning of ""The Invasion"" the uninspired fourth version of the 1956 sci-fi classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" a space shuttle explodes sprinkling wreckage almost the length of the U.S. That detritus carries a peculiar payload -- a clear malleable substance able to survive the extreme chill of space and the flaring heat of re-entry. Those who come into contact with it suddenly dont seem like themselves. Beltway psychiatrist and divorcee Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman whos been given the same last name as the doctor in ""Body Snatchers"") simply reaches for a prescription pad when a longtime patient hysterically insists that her husband is an impostor. He looks like the man she married but hes so well calm so free of emotion. Then Carol takes a hard look at the affectless citizenry waiting at the bus stops walking alongside her takes note of the odd substance hanging off a piece of the candy her son Oliver (the very good Jackson Bond) brings home on Halloween. Officials attribute the symptoms to a new strain of flu but Carol is unconvinced sharing her concerns with fellow doctor and sometime date Ben (Daniel Craig). Under the circumstances maybe it wasnt such a smart idea for her to let Oliver spend the weekend with his dad whos got a lofty position at the Centers for Disease Control and was one of the first responders when the shuttle crashed. What helped give the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" its nightmare creepiness -- the movie has lost no power to haunt -- was the low-key low-tech feel. The small-town setting made the story all the more personal and immediate; it unfolded coolly and inexorably. Except for one terrifically adroit sequence in a subway there is nothing understated about ""The Invasion."" With all the shoot-outs the screaming the chases collisions and fireballs there isnt much time for storytelling (unless you count the piffle spouted during a dinner-party scene thats meant to illuminate the movies theme) very little time devoted to the search for an antidote to the bizarre ailment (its found with comic speed) and next to no time for the resolution. In any case the sound and fury will keep audiences wide awake and thats a good thing. When aliens invade nodding off can be a risky business. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation.

"Superbad reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Superbad reviewed. Superbad reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 16 2007 657 PM Superbad See it for Michael Cera. By Dana Stevens Superbad Superbad (Sony) is as lurching awkward and dirty-minded as the three horny man-boys at its center--but not in the end quite as funny or endearing. In the tradition of the great high-school party movies of the past quarter-century-- American Graffiti Sixteen Candles Dazed and Confused--it follows its heroes through one embarrassing days journey into an even more excruciating night. The next morning they wake up sadder wiser and marginally more sexually experienced. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Its too bad that the often very funny script written by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen takes a setup that could have been simplicity itself and piles on so many outlandish twists and grossout set pieces that the relationship at the movies center--the co-dependent friendship between shy brainy Evan (Michael Cera) and tubby sex-crazed Seth (Jonah Hill)--is nearly obscured. Watching Superbad brought out the prude in me--not because of the drinking or the sex or the unbelievably profane dialogue but because of what can only be described as the movies moral code. Advertisement To put it simply for nine-tenths of the film Hills Seth treats other people--especially his ostensible best buds--like utter crap. After Seth and Evan get invited against all odds to a cool girls party they persuade Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) a pencil-necked geek so socially inept that he makes them look like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin to buy them a hundred bucks worth of booze with his highly dubious fake ID. Just as Fogell is on the verge of success his lights get punched out in a liquor-store holdup--and when the cops arrive to investigate Seth convinces Evan to ditch their pal and round up the alcohol some other way. As it turns out Fogell--or ""McLovin"" the alias he assumes thanks to that fake ID--has a far better night than his friends do. Hes taken joyriding by the worlds most immature cops (played by Rogen and Bill Hader) while Evan and Seth get stranded at a scary adult party and menaced by an unsavory thug (Kevin Corrigan). Still I was never able to forgive Hills character for that initial betrayal. Isnt it part of the outcast code that you stand by your friends in time of need? Seth is meant to be a lovable nut and hes given many of the movies funniest lines but all too often--especially when he browbeats Evan for getting into a better college than he did--he just comes off as a jackass. Many mishaps and one too many car accidents later the boys finally meet up at the right party where they clumsily attempt to court--OK nail--Becca (Martha MacIsaac) and Jules (Emma Stone). I wish the boys had spent a little less screen time on their way to Jules party and more at it because what happens once they get there is both darker and sweeter than anything thats come before. The moment when Evan alone in a bathroom glugs from a bottle of retsina to get up the courage to approach Becca is both disgusting and uproarious. And the hideously uncomfortable scene that follows in which the plastered Becca hurls herself at him and then hurls on him is like no other sex scene Ive seen in a teen movie--even as we watch her make a total fool of herself the movie somehow leaves her dignity intact. Critics are making noise about Christopher Mintz-Plasse an 18-year-old non-actor who was cast after a nationwide search. And while hes perfect as the so-lame-hes-cool Fogell/McLovin its Michael Cera (heretofore best known as Jason Batemans son on Arrested Development) whose comic timing quietly steals the show. While Jonah Hill mugs babbles and curses a blue streak Cera gets laughs from the tiniest bits of physical business His knock-kneed run is a joke in itself and a moment when hes scared by the vibration of his own cell phone is inexplicably hilarious. Though its directed by Greg Mottola (The Daytrippers) Superbad is clearly riding on the coattails of its producer the coolest geek in town Judd Apatow who finally managed to get the 10-year-old project greenlighted after the success of The 40-Year-Old Virgin. The screenplay was begun when Rogen and Goldberg were still in high school themselves and that immaturity shows both in the movies manic energy and in its lack of an overall moral vision. However promising the gifts of Apatow proteges like Rogen and Goldberg they need to grow into being great screenwriters and its going to take more than one night and a bottle of retsina.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Boys of Summer Judd Apatow amp; Co. take the teen sex comedy to a whole new level. The Nanny Diaries doesnt raise the chick-flick bar. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis Illustration by Crystal Shrimp  (Photo Melissa Moseley/Courtesy of Columbia Pictures) Superbad might be the most provocative teen sex comedy ever made; it is certainly one of the most convulsively funny. Its protagonists are graduating high-school buddies swimming in hormones and uncertainty. Seth (Jonah Hill) is blobby and loud; Evan (Michael Cera) skinny hysterical and a tad girlish. (Think Mostel and Wilder in The Producers.) A virgin and likely to remain so for some time Seth talks of nothing but sexa nonstop stream of F- and P- and D-words that would make David Mamet sit up and salute. The more prepossessing Evan is embarrassed by his friends sexist ejaculations; he respects womenfrom afar. (He shifts and stammers around the cute female classmate flashing him the tongue.) Both look to a party that evening for resolution. Their task is to procure alcohol which Seth is sure will get them laid. In the course of their odyssey they plunge into a night world of sex drugs and aggression in which no ones development is unarrested. The co-producer is Judd Apatow of Knocked Up the co-writer Seth Rogen of the same. Some right-wing commentators pretzeled themselves up to praise that filmwhich had naughty words and drugs and premarital sex but hallelujah came down squarely on the side of family values. The same is true of Superbad but the pretzels will have to be even twistier. Apatow and company (the director here is Greg Mottola) have a pipeline to the adolescent id and a little too much fun frolicking in its hot springs of obscenity. If teens come away with the message that booze and sex and drugs cant buy them love (or happiness) theyll also feel the compulsion to talk dirty drink fuck and learn the lesson for themselvesas well they should provided they dont kill themselves doing it. Superbad is like American Graffiti with a crucial difference The adults are as childlike and out of control as the children (if not more so). In George Lucass funny-sad paean to lost innocence the teens sabotaged a police cruiser; in Superbad two drunken cops (Rogen and Bill Hader a master of deadpan dementia) shoot up their own car to impress Seth and Evans dorky friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Dispatched to buy the booze Fogell has created a fake I.D. bearing the one-word pseudonym McLovina name that will live I predict as long as teen movies. Hes so endearingly not a McLovin that you can almost understand the policemens infatuation with him. He is the primordial Jungian dork within us all. By the time the cops are firing guns in juvenile ecstasy the movie has entered a fugue state. Adam Sternbergh in this magazine called those unable to let go of childhood grups while writer Christopher Noxon has dubbed them rejuveniles Whatever you call them Apatow has become their Florenz Ziegfeldand maybe too their David Lynch. Still in search of alcohol Seth and Evan stumble into a grown-up inferno in which hairy men inexplicably punch one another to a pulp. An addled redneck cokehead makes Evan sing for him while a busty babe who dirty-dances with the enraptured Seth leaves his trousers smeared with menstrual blood. Its like the candy-colored clown they call the sandman sequence in Blue Velvet. The donkey scene in Pinocchio also comes to mind. This is where delinquents go to degenerate. At close to two hours Superbad feels fifteen minutes too long although Mottola and writers Rogen and Evan Goldberg want to take you past the high to the inevitable plummet. No American Pie climactic couplings here. Instead puke and loathing. The filmmakers linger on the homoerotic undercurrents of adolescent male friendship in a way that other teen sex comedies avoid like the (gay) plague. Thats what makes Superbad so vitaland so of its time. In the seventies and eighties even explicit teen sex comedies like Fast Times at Ridgemont High unfolded in a culture with a fair amount of shame. Now with Fast Times and American Pie as touchstones with MySpace turning even shy people into exhibitionists filmmakers can begin where their predecessors ended. Soon it might not be repression we have to worry about but having nothing left to repress. The Nanny Diaries based on Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Krauss best-selling novel (a roman a clef) is a grim slog. Scarlett Johansson plays Annie an unaffected adorably clumsy Jersey girl who doesnt know who she is. Shanghaied in Central Park by Mrs. X (Laura Linney) she is thrust into the Upper East Side world of inattentive gazillionaires self-obsessed trophy wives and children at once spoiled and neglected. The perspective of the writer-directors Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini (American Splendor) is both contemptuous and enviouswhich is honest I suppose given New Yorks ever-burgeoning income gap and the bitterness of its have-nots and have-not-enoughs. (That ambivalence is admittedly a motif of this magazine which the heroine dips into before taking her job.) 1 2 Next Share this story...

"Superbad Geeks Gone Wild washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Superbad Geeks Gone Wild Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 17 2007 Already dubbed the ""American Pie"" of the MySpace generation ""Superbad"" promises to be this summers cure for the back-to-school blahs simultaneously trafficking in the hoariest cliches of the teen sex comedy genre while slyly sending them up. Not surprisingly this trick has been pulled off in a movie produced by Judd Apatow who has proven to be exceptionally adroit at delivering outrageously raunchy comedy with a self-conscious wink. Indeed ""Superbad"" often plays like a prequel to Apatows hit comedy ""Knocked Up"" in which Seth Rogen portrayed a dumpy pothead who ultimately gets the babe. In ""Superbad"" -- which Rogen co-wrote -- Jonah Hill plays a high school senior who resembles the future Rogen a chubby foul-mouthed porn addict (named Seth) who is determined to snag a girlfriend for the summer. While Seth slobbers over a sharp hottie named Jules (Emma Stone) in home economics class his best friend Evan (the reedy-voiced Michael Cera from ""Arrested Development"") quietly lusts for a shy girl named Becca (Martha MacIsaac) in math. Following the night-in-a-life structure of such gold standards as ""American Graffiti"" and ""Dazed and Confused"" ""Superbad"" chronicles Seth and Evans attempts to score liquor for a graduation party the better to endrunken and finally bed the objects of their desires. (Rogen who shows up in a cameo role wrote ""Superbad"" with his friend Evan Goldberg when they were teenagers.) ""Superbad"" is already surrounded by a nimbus of buzz that virtually guarantees it will be a big hit not only in theaters but in its ancillary afterlife; with its slapstick rehearsal of ever-more-mortifying high school humiliations (the inopportune hormonal explosions; the halting disastrous attempts at casual small talk; the endless opportunities for public rejection) its one long wince-inducing contact buzz kill. And its cinematic catnip to teenagers longing to witness the pratfalls of bigger losers than themselves. Hill brings a certain bug-eyed fat mans grace to the role of Seth whose pranks and one-liners -- none of which can be repeated in a family newspaper -- all have a nasty edge. Ceras Evan is far gentler and his humor lies more in his persona and delivery than in the shock value of what he says. (He has an encounter with Becca in the hall during which he calls her ""missy"" and ""sister"" that is all the more hilarious for being so inexplicably so.) Not surprising in a movie about geeks trying to get it on the geekiest character is the most indelible Newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse steals the movie in his screen debut as a nerd di tutti nerds a kid whose fake ID reads ""McLovin."" With his eyes squinted shut behind the standard-issue glasses every line reading he delivers is an aria of quivering adenoidal insecurity. Greg Mottola who made the terrific Manhattan picaresque ""The Daytrippers"" directs ""Superbad"" with his characteristically light touch even if its used in the service of filthy sight gags endless profanity and an inordinate obsession with bodily fluids (the ante started with the hair gel gag in ""Theres Something About Mary"" has now been upped to menstrual blood). Surely in some Cinema Studies class this fall it will be argued that ""Superbad"" might be the most artistically and intellectually honest movie of Apatows film career. With his classic television series ""Freaks and Geeks"" Apatow displayed an uncanny sympathy with teenage anxiety and aspiration. His movies ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" on the other hand dealt with superannuated Beavises and Butt-heads stuck in a state of loutish arrested adolescence. Those movies though often uproariously funny have had a pathetic even hateful edge to them and it felt as if Apatow was having his sexist cake and eating it too with a helping of preemptive self-loathing. In ""Superbad"" hes back to focusing on adolescents so their stupidity about women at least has a chance of leading to wisdom; of all the films hes been involved in it feels the most humane and unforced. But lets be real This is a movie that succeeds or fails in direct proportion to how well it can deliver a penis joke. As a raunch-and-retch vector ""Superbad"" is as efficient as they come. What makes it transcend its generic shackles are the two final scenes which reveal a staggering degree of candor and sophistication in acknowledging the homoeroticism that underlies so many teen sex comedies. With its subversive and even touching final twist ""Superbad"" proves itself to be not just smutty and stupid but tender and all too aware of the rue that can lie behind the smiles of a summer night. Superbad (104 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for pervasive crude and sexual content strong profanity drinking some drug use and graphic comic violence all involving teens.

So my sense of whats funny about the hardware and its capabilities -- a fertile source of laughs in this torrentially foulmouthed sex-mad comedy of good high school kids gone horny and male friendship cemented by sexual anxiety -- is that of an observer rather than an owner. Also my high school years are so far behind me that the guys who were geeks then are now the balding fathers of sons who have inherited the earth as website wunderkinds and highly paid sitcom writers. But while it is demographically challenging for me (and perhaps for others who graduated high school when thong underwear was still only an option for strippers not students) to love the movie with knowing gusto its easy to enjoy the pulsing phallic comedic energy of the enterprise. Superbad is a third serving of gaily dirty man-boy sweetness after The 40 Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up under the aegis of comedy impresario Judd Apatow and its a festival of blithely unreliable information about What Women Want. As best friends and graduating seniors Seth (Jonah Hill the stocky shock-haired high-flame Oliver Hardy of the pair) and Evan (nascent comedy superstar Michael Cera the low-burn Stan Laurel) face the prospect of a partnership disrupted by the distractions of college they envision one last chance to unload their nagging virginity Theyll get a couple of girls drunk at a party and do em. Lay em plow em...choose the age-old crudity of your choice. For help in procuring liquor the underage strategists enlist a fellow nerd (novice phenom Christopher Mintz-Plasse who provides false hope of similar stardom to the millions of four-eyed sparrow-chested peers without his unique squeaky style). And the supersuave mono-moniker the kid chooses when he scores a fake ID -- McLovin -- becomes an extended punchline involving doofus cops and a wild no-parents- in-sight party. The rest is mishap improv declarations of love (between BFFs Seth and Evan) and well chastity. Thats Superbads clean little secret the throwback thing thats almost as fascinating to this seasoned female as the fabulous illustrations of male genitalia (clad in the raiment of superheroes) that Seth used to draw in grade school. For all the boasts about banging the scramble to buy booze the elaborate teen-male nightmare horror at the sight of scary menstrual blood from some girls mysterious Down There the movie doesnt stray from a path of righteousness. This notion of a wild party is so safe it might as well be an instance of approved Amish oat-sowing. We take his word that Evan has a crush on his nice classmate Becca (Martha MacIsaac) although we have no idea who she is besides a female person who even when dangerously drunk and in the mood doesnt take off her bra. We agree to pretend to believe that Seth has plans to get it on with Jules (Emma Stone) the impossibly perfect hottie whos popular and not mean and retains her coolness although she doesnt drink when all around her do. In The 40 Year-Old Virgin the desires of a sexually frightened early-middle-aged man meet up with the reality of a mature woman with her own wants. In Knocked Up a younger skittish fellow faces the adult consequences of sexual activity with a semi-mature woman who has to figure out her own wants. Were going back to the future my friends Jules is even less likely representing a real live girl. I know that teen transformation is the point of Superbads fantasy vibe a story about boy friends not the chicks who get in the way. But its also the movies limitation. Abundantly talented Seth Rogen (star of Knocked Up who plays one of the cops opposite Saturday Night Lives Bill Hader) and Evan Goldberg (best-childhood-friend-from-funny-Canada) wrote the script when they were themselves young(er) guys. And although Apatow (whos almost 40) produces and Greg Mottola (even older an episode director of Apatows Undeclared) directs with an adult understanding of and affection for teen hormonal rhythms the story is still that of boys and their wangdoodles. Superbad is cute if you like guys who arent even remotely bad in a coming-of-age tale so old-fashioned the girls might just as well be wearing bloomers.

"Superbad | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; superbad ) Superbad (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli What if Quentin Tarantino collaborated with John Hughes on a teen comedy? Superbad is a decent approximation of what the result might be. As with Borat there are no sacred cows here. The movie produced by Judd Apatow written by Seth Rogan amp; Evan Goldberg and directed by Greg Mottola pushes the genres envelope a little farther than anything before it has done. It recalls American Pie but with less nudity (in fact theres none to speak of) and dialogue that is more clever and more profane. The movie is frequently amusing and occasionally uproarious. The plot is straightforward as befits a production thats more about jokes dialogue and character interaction than narrative progression. The protagonists are three stereotypical male high school seniors whose thoughts turn to sex once every 3.5 seconds. Theres Evan (Michael Cera) whos close to an ""average guy"" - shy around girls but open with his friends. Seth (Jonah Hill) is overweight and pugnacious and aware that his appearance doesnt make him a babe-magnet. Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is the uber-nerd whose social inadequacies and lack of emotional maturity allow him to think that the single moniker of ""McLuvin"" is a good name on a fake I.D. Fate gives the boys an opportunity to impress some girls by getting alcohol for a party. Seth has his eyes on Jules (Emma Stone) the organizer of the party. Evan is after Becca (Martha MacIsaac) a girl in his math class. And Fogell has chosen Nicola (Aviva) whose provocative manner of dress leaves him tongue-tied. Their misadventures take them to strange places and cause them to run afoul of Officers Slater (Bill Hader) and Michaels (Seth Rogan) the most inept cops this side of Hot Fuzz. Teen comedies have always found it more interesting to focus on social outsiders than members of the in-crowd and Superbad is not an exception. While Evan Seth and Fogell are cut from the whole cloth of types they achieve a level of individuality that is while not unprecedented at least unusual. The filmmakers avoid the seductive pull of reducing their protagonists to caricatures - a move that has killed many a similar film. Part of this is due to the deceptive smartness of the screenplay but a lions share of the credit must go to the actors. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill exhibit an infectious likeability while newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse uses his exuberant obnoxiousness to steal scenes. This is also a largely parent-free zone. Other than Stacy Edwards as Evans mother who is on camera exclusively for her cleavage mature adults are in short supply. The prime requisite of any comedy - that it generate laughs - is amply met. Superbad is chock full of R-rated glee. Although there are instances of physical humor (some of which pays homage either intentionally or unintentionally to The Three Stooges) and sex-related jokes (including penis drawings) most of the comedy is in the dialogue. There are some hilarious one-liners including one remark about health class that no one leaving the theater will forget. Through all of the mayhem however director Mottola never loses sight of his characters and thats a key point to remember. While we laugh both with and at the protagonists we also care about them. The trailers for Superbad are uniformly awful and should therefore be avoided. Having seen the movie its easy to understand why the advertisements are lackluster. The film needs context for the jokes to be funny. Lobbed naked at audiences they often dont work. And thankfully the previews dont commit the cardinal sin of giving away the best punch-lines. Certainly Superbad is lewd crude and rude but thats not going to frighten away a significant portion of the target audience. Then again one could argue that this movie is made not just for those who are teenagers but also for those who remember what its like to be one. If the movie has a failing its a tendency to be long-winded. This is the same issue that has plagued Judd Apatows excellent directorial efforts The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. The denouement feels unnecessarily protracted and the number of scenes with the cops (some of the least comically successful material in the movie) could have been trimmed. Superbad is a very good little 95 minute movie that runs a little over 110 minutes. It takes a brave filmmaker to release a movie called Superbad. Fortunately for Mottola and friends its impossible to use the title to describe the quality. And while Superbad may not be ""supergood"" its engaging enough to be worth paying full admission prices.

By David Denby Michael Cera and Jonah Hill in ""Superbad"" a movie directed by Greg Mottola and co-produced by Judd Apatow.   Credit ROBERT RISKO The twenty-three-year-old comic actor Jonah Hill has an aureole of electrified hair a coarse whine and plump hands which he waves around like an unhinged conductor. Hill specializes in playing huffy near-hysterics. He was part of Seth Rogens crew in ""Knocked Up""--the petulant boy who had a nervous breakdown in a hospital waiting room when he realized that disease might be lurking nearby. In ""Superbad"" he teams up with Michael Cera a sweet-faced charmer who drains all tension out of his lines. If Hill is as frantic as the Three Stooges wrapped into one Cera (from the TV series ""Arrested Development"") is so circumspect--a young man hampered by ethics--that he never makes himself clear. The two actors play inseparable high-school pals Seth (Hill) and Evan (Cera) who must soon part company and go off to college and they are magically funny together. I recently wrote that I could happily do without any more movies devoted to the breaking of the male bond. Yet heres an uproarious and touching picture on that theme directed by Greg Mottola who made the 1997 independent film ""The Daytrippers"" and co-produced by Judd Apatow who wrote and directed ""Knocked Up."" Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg who were high-school buddies in Vancouver began working on the script when they were thirteen. The movie still displays vestiges of infantile glee but after much revision and some obvious guidance the structure and a lot of the dialogue have become ripely Apatovian. Like ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" the movie combines desperately filthy talk with the most tender even delicate emotion. ""Superbad"" is a suburban mock-epic. Seth and Evan with the help of their friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) agree to buy the booze for a party that the coolest girls in their class are throwing. The boys are convinced that if they deliver the goods the girls will get so drunk that theyll make out with guys by mistake. ""We could be that mistake"" Seth shouts hopefully. Getting themselves to the party however turns out to be a journey somewhat more difficult than that endured by the Greeks coming home from Troy. Fogell a primal nerd with a needle nose and a voice like a vibrating thistle procures a fake I.D. which identifies him simply as McLovin a Hawaiian organ donor. As McLovin he gets clobbered by a thief as hes buying the liquor; a couple of antic cops then decide that the bruised and shaken boy is really a macho hero and drive him all over town getting smashed and shooting off their guns. (They want to be teen-agers themselves.) Meanwhile Evan and Seth fall in with some pugnacious lowlifes having their own party. The boys friendship almost falls apart under the strain of arriving at the proper gathering with an armful of booze. In spirit ""Superbad"" isnt so different from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982) and other rude teen comedies made years ago. But the tone of ""Superbad"" like that of other recent teen movies is so profane and anatomical that it would shock Sean Penns loutish Spicoli. The boys in ""Superbad"" are all Internet-porn addicts. Their talk is not just dirty but bizarrely detailed--spangled with fantasy odd practices and curious devices. They know more about sex than boys did a couple of decades ago but theyre frightened by what they know--the expectation of performance is so much more explicit. For them the only mystery is flesh itself and the presence of a willing girl sends them into anguished fits of dithering. The movie succeeds as a teens wild fantasy of a night in which everything goes wrong revised by an adults melancholy sense that nothing was ever meant to go right. At times Mottola loses that kind of perception of character and destiny in mere slapstick Jonah Hill gets knocked over by a car not once but twice and is smacked with a baseball bat as well. The scenes of the two gleeful cops (Rogen and Bill Hader) horsing around with Fogell never rise above the level of goofy TV. Mottola is at his best when he sticks to the trials of the Seth-Evan friendship and pulls quirky rhythms out of his actors. He creates a couple of minor miracles. For example theres a scene in which Cera is stuck in a room with a group of meatballs who think hes some hot young singer and wont let him out. He begins to croon in a light uncertain voice and the guys are so stoned that they start singing backup as if he were an MTV star leading them along. Mottola is also adept at the kids casual meetings and run-ins--the way for instance the boys want to look at the girls bodies in school but turn away embarrassed even though the girls are eager to be looked at. And working with Martha MacIsaac and Emma Stone as Seth and Evans prize targets (both of them smarter than the boys) Mottola skillfully manages the missed connections and semi-incoherence of sozzled boy-girl chatter--the talk that hops around like a needle skipping from one groove to another and then back again. The kids have their party but the sexual encounters fall on the comic side of catastrophe. At the same time theres a gentle and entirely intentional homoerotic strain--never acted upon--running through the Seth-Evan friendship. In a startling digression Seth airs his memories (which we see in flashback) of a time when he was a little boy and couldnt stop drawing penises. A kind of exuberant art show follows with page after page covering school desks--simple line drawings of magnificent organs and phallicized trees artillery and towers. The sequence is hilarious and charming--a childs garden of verses for our time. What the teen-age Seth really wants from his romantic life remains a mystery. When the boys the morning after the party run into the girls in a mall and the couples pair off and go in opposite directions Seth casts a sorrowful glance at the receding Evan. Heterosexuality that infinitely dangerous terrain will be a place he enters gingerly and with more than a little regret. The media celebrity system is kept aloft not just by powerful handlers but by layers of semi-anonymous toilers--press agents and talent bookers and well below them headwaiters bouncers and chauffeurs--all of whom help build and guard a mystique of which they as much as anyone are the victims since most of them are disposable. But at least they work and are paid at the stars behest whereas paparazzi get paid only when they violate someones privacy. This nearly criminal group of intruders are caught in a situation that almost guarantees self-loathing much of the time they pursue minor celebrities who they know are just the products of chance luck and the frantic labor of people like themselves. ""Delirious"" the new film by the writer-director Tom DiCillo--whose comedy ""Living in Oblivion"" (1995) is the best movie made about independent filmmaking--takes a clear-eyed but sympathetic look at a Manhattan paparazzo one Les Galantine (Steve Buscemi) who lives on the edges of a system that abuses but also needs him. Les is a cynic a moocher and a loser yet in his unhappy way he is also an ever hopeful novitiate in the Temple of Fame. He wants that scandalous tabloid cover shot that will earn him a week or two of esteem. In his world thats as good as it gets. Les picks up a pretty street kid--Toby (Michael Pitt) who wants to be an actor--makes him his assistant and teaches him how to get into parties cadge goody bags and other necessary skills. They live in Less grubby apartment but as outcasts from their families they are both spiritually homeless--two lost men spinning around the city trying to force their way past sullen gatekeepers. As DiCillo admits the movie bears more than a casual resemblance to ""Midnight Cowboy""--with Dustin Hoffman as the battle-scarred bum and Jon Voight as the beautiful outsider--but theres also an element of ""A Star Is Born."" Les and Toby have multiple encounters with a troubled young pop star (Alison Lohman) who sees something innocent in Toby that touches her. But his innocence is easily shed. Toby eventually hooks up with the singer but first he lives with a talent booker (Gina Gershon) who gets him his own ""reality"" cable show and makes him a star. On his way up Toby leaves Les behind. ""Delirious"" was shot quickly with a handheld camera and some of it feels raw both visually and emotionally. Buscemi is haggard and bilious a bottom dog who will never give up and Pitts angel face seems to rot after a while. Some of the plot turns dont quite make sense but this is still a strong bitter movie about a milieu that the director intimately understands. DiCillo is terrific at mapping out what might be called the traffic aspects of fame the rushing in and out of hotel rooms and clubs; the pecking order; the fluent sycophancy; the back-and-forth of favors and rebuffs. ""Delirious"" comes close to satire at times but it doesnt exaggerate a brutal and unstable process. Les despite all his sordid habits is a baby compared with the genuine professionals working the scene. And Toby may be on top but youd have to be a fool to think hell stay there long. The movie is exhilarating in a way that only hard-won knowledge of the world can be.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

The bawdy jokes score big points but its the rueful acknowledgement of adolescent embarrassment and humiliation that most distinguishes ""Superbad"" another ultra-raunchy and commercial sex comedy from the Judd Apatow laugh factory. Co-written by and featuring ""Knocked Up"" star Seth Rogen this very cheesy-looking account of three horndogs long nights journey into hazy self-awareness is like ""American Pie"" with a conscience. Fixation on all manner of bodily functions and a plethora of outrageously out-there gags guarantee strong teen and date-night turnout although demos will skew younger than for ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" Pic will never die as a high school and frathouse keg-party favorite. Although this picaresque little odyssey is decidedly set in the present day the title silhouetted opening credits and predominantly funk-soul soundtrack provide a distinctly 70s feel an impression furthered by a muddy fuzzy visual style (perhaps partly attributable to nocturnal digital shooting) that harks back to the day when AIP and Crown Intl. were knocking out their own teensploitationers. Its easy to imagine the elemental script and storyline -- cooked up by Rogen and Evan Goldberg when they were teenagers -- being filmed at the time they first started writing it Two nerdy best friends trying to get laid on a party night before going their separate ways to college is a premise that can play anytime anywhere. But the dialogue back then would never have been as bluntly crude as it is here; nor would the final credits have been festooned with creative drawings of phalluses a nod to the childhood obsession of the Rogen stand-in here. That boy not at all coincidentally named Seth (younger Rogen clone Jonah Hill) is a motor-mouthed fatso born with an over-supply of vulgar bravado. Best friend Evan (named for co-writer Evan Goldberg and played by Michael Cera) is thinner taller and more presentable but equally keen to get a little experience in the saddle before heading off for college -- Dartmouth in his case some unnamed lesser institution for Seth. After some preliminaries designed to show how uncouth these guys are and how unlimited the films grossness will be plot mechanics are set in motion when the coolest most composed girl in school Jules (Emma Stone) amazes Seth by inviting him to a party at her place that night and assigns him the task of supplying the booze. Anything is possible from this point on as Seth and Evan accompanied by skinny ultra-dweeb Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) have one excruciating scrape after another -- getting involved in a liquor store robbery consorting with some unsavory types at another party and ending up in the hands of two wayward cops (Rogen and Bill Hader) -- before arriving at their destination. As funny as much of this stuff is scripters and director Greg Mottola (in a welcome return to features a full decade after his splendid debut with ""The Daytrippers"") stretch too far the notion that the real fun lies in getting there. At close to two hours ""Superbad"" is simply too long for the sort of picture it is; pic has some noticeable downtime and its all in the middle with too many goofy shenanigans involving the cops and assorted fringe characters that come and go. You really want the boys to get to the party already and see what they get cooking with the girls. Its worth the wait. Multiple gross-outs are served up to be sure but theyre not what you might expect and the aftermath bears notably lifelike doses of regret and sober reflection on the boys silly sometimes inexcusable behavior. Its a hallmark of Apatows films thus far whatever his direct role that stock situations and characters are endowed with extra dimensions of humanity weakness and insecurity. ""Superbad"" may be more overtly comic than ""Virgin"" or ""Knocked Up"" but its darkness and thoughtfulness are still notable for a genre so thoroughly dedicated to raucous surfaces and money moments. At once just typical teenagers and clueless fools Seth and Evan are ingratiating leads and Hill and Cera fit so easily together you can believe theyve known each other for years; whether deliberately or not Seth comes off as genuinely obnoxious at times and not just amusingly assertive which adds to the realism. Stealing the film however is Mintz-Plasse an unknown high schooler who calls to mind a really twerpy teenage Dustin Hoffman; the guys totally off the wall. As the main girls in the mix Stone and Martha MacIsaac are accessibly human and nothing like the snotty ""whatever"" bimbos so often seen in such fare. Tech qualities are so grubby one is convinced it must have been deliberate. At least at screening caught print looked like it had been stuck in some vault since 1978 and sound mix was atrocious with levels of ambient sound varying enormously from scene to scene but often not even existing placing the characters dialogue in a virtual audio vacuum.
