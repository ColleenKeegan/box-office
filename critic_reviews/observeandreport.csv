Observe and Report covers those themes too - but only in addition to its main interests in mental derangement drug addiction and good old homegrown American fascism.The film has been likened to Taxi Driver. Its a reasonable comparison though King of Comedy might be more appropriate. Seth Rogen has never been better or more unsettling as mall security head Ronnie Barnhardt whose increasing moral torpor and self loathing are constantly threatening to blossom into outright psychosis.It could be argued that Observe and Report sets a worrying precedent for mainstream comedy. With scenes of date rape drug taking and violence against children and police officers this is grim and often shocking writer-director Jody Hill sketches characters with insight but without an ounce of sympathy. Taken as comedy the film is effective but uneven relying on discomfort rather than smart jokes.But take it seriously and it pays off. For Hill the real threat to America isnt terrorists or politicians its those ordinary jumped-up fascist thugs - cops managers security guards - who have just enough power to want more. Bracing bleak and berserk this is a film which laughs in the face of American intolerance and comes up punch-drunk and grinning.

The converse is true in that any film that suprises you picks up a better rating than t deserves and this is a case in point this film fails in almost everythign it sets out to do unless its objectives where alienate the audience and lose money; however; it does have some itersting touches and a degree of originality about it not enough to save it from its woeful dialogue and lackluster pacing but coupled with some hardworking performances with bad material I can understand why a critic (who lets face it gets paid to see the film where the rest of us cough up hard earned cash) might find a few twists and suprises in there.

"Observe and Report | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; observe-and-report ) Observe and Report (United States 2009) April 10 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Probably every review written of Observe and Report will mention in one context or another Paul Blart Mall Cop. The connection is understandable both are satirical looks at the trials and tribulations of life as a private security guard (a.k.a. ""rent-a-cop""). Thats where the similarities end however. Paul Blart is genial good-natured and a little silly - a perfect family feature. Observe and Report is none of those things. Its dark and demented twisted and perverse - the kind of motion picture that will find a cadre of devout supporters but risks mainstream derision. For Seth Rogen everyones favorite lovable loser this represents a daring reach beyond his comfort zone. This is Rogens Punch Drunk Love a feature that may cause consternation within his die-hard fan base but which will open the eyes of those who expected this to be just another dumb sophomoric comedy filled with lame jokes and half-baked characterizations. It takes guts to make a dark comedy that works on its own terms and writer/director Jody Hill shows no fear. The film starts out with a bait-and-switch. Initially it looks like Rogen is playing yet another in a line of likeable sad-sacks. In this case hes Ronnie Barnhardt Mall Cop. He takes his job seriously and runs the mall like his private fiefdom. He has four underlings - second-in-command Dennis (Michael PeA+-a) the Yuen twins (John and Matt Yuan) and Charles (Jesse Plemons) - who view him as their fearless leader. Ronnie is insanely infatuated with cosmetics girl Brandi (Anna Faris) who sees him as a drag and a boor. Nell (Collette Wolfe) the woman who is genuinely interested in Ronnie is too plain and good-natured for him to notice except when he wants his daily morning free coffee. When two crimes occur during Ronnies watch - a parking lot flasher and a rash of night robberies - Ronnie finds his world invaded by outsiders. He views the police represented by Detective Harrison (Ray Liotta) to be unwelcome interlopers and becomes infatuated with the old maxim If you cant beat em join em. Tonally Observe and Report is strikingly similar to Bad Santa. Both films feature warped anti-heroes whose socially unacceptable behavior becomes the source of biting satire and less sophisticated comedy. Those looking for copious ""laugh out loud"" moments may be disappointed by what Observe and Report has to offer. Yes there are some funny set pieces but the movie is more about incisive parody of malls police and todays ""gun culture"" than it is an endless series of lowbrow jokes and gags. Rogen succeeds in making Ronnie who initially seems like a harmless dufus into a creepy individual. Heres a guy who lives with his perpetually drunk mother (Celia Weston) doesnt think twice about date raping a girl who has vomited all over herself and liberally spews racial epithets and ""fuck yous."" (Theres one scene in which that un-rhyming couplet is uttered about 30 times.) Yet he craves respect and adulation and somehow always sees himself as ""the good guy."" At one point he is called delusional and that sums him up in a word. The movie is designed to make viewers a little uncomfortable - that fuels the humor and provides the edge. Like Bad Santa Observe and Report offers a form of redemption to its main character without seeming to sell out. The ending is wink-wink nudge-nudge tongue-in-cheek. Its the kind of thing that could easily be mistaken for a conventional denouement until you examine all that comes before it. Observe and Report is about pushing the envelope and defying conventions. How else to explain a climax in which a fat naked man is seen from a frequently full-frontal perspective as he streaks through a mall. The joke here is that people are more terrified of a naked man than a psycho pseudo-cop and it highlights the countrys preference for violence over nudity. The penis is more frightening that the subsequent gunshot. Observe and Report is often subversive in ways that are not immediately apparent. Rogen is perfect for the role in the same way that Adam Sandler was perfect for Punch Drunk Love. The baggage he brings to the movie sets up expectations that are effectively deflated. I was growing weary of the Rogen who has been dominating screens since The 40-Year-Old Virgin; its good to see him doing something new. Ray Liotta finally gets to do his over-the-top frothing-at-the-mouth cop routine in a comedy where it works much better than in a thriller. And Anna Faris proves she can get down and dirty with the best of them. After this no one will think of her as ""the cute girl"" again. Observe and Report is being mis-marketed with trailers depicting it as yet another screwball Rogen film or as a slightly more raunchy version of Paul Blart. Expectations along those lines could lead to an unnerving experience. Approach Observe and Report as a dark nasty motion picture that rarely cheats for laughs and doesnt pull many punches. It falls short of brilliant but its a lot more daring than what passes for ""dark comedy"" these days and it reminds us that ""feel bad"" comedies may not always be as funny as ""feel good"" ones but when they work they can ultimately be more satisfying.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor April 11 2009 Save for later Saved Seth Rogen stars as Ronnie in Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures dark comedy ""Observe and Report."" Warner Brothers Pictures/MCT/NEWSCOM          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Seth Rogen goes dark in ""Observe and Report"" a weirdo comedy that at times owes as much to ""Taxi Driver"" as ""Superbad."" The writer-director Jody Hill has cited Martin Scorseses film as a primary influence but one should not take this comparison too far. The movie starring Rogen as a mall cop with anger management issues is essentially a goony romp flecked with disturbing eruptions of violence.Those eruptions more often than not dont enlarge the jokes or provide a scarier more comprehensive take on the human comedy. (""Taxi Driver"" by the way with its cretinous vengeful cabbie played by Robert De Niro was a lot closer to black comedy than most people realize.) Hill is trying to capture the teen gross-out contingent while also playing to the adult crowd with flashes of ""seriousness."" Its an unstable mix not because light and dark should not go together but because their pairing here resembles a matter of convenience - a way of seeming risky while not risking very much.Rogens Ronnie Barnhardt is a rent-a-cop security chief who regards his turf - the enclosed Forest Ridge Mall in Albuquerque N.M. - as his fiefdom. With only a taser flashlight modified golf cart and a ragtag team of helpers Ronnie is vastly ill-equipped to serve the outsize ambitions of his ego. Then a flasher begins terrorizing the mall and Ronnie sees his capture as the way to propel himself into big-time law enforcement. Unfortunately the police investigator assigned to the case Ray Liottas Detective Harrison regards Ronnie as nothing more than an annoying rent-a-cop. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The match-up between Rogen and Liotta isnt the wingding you might expect. These two actors might have struck sparks in a flat-out comedy - Liottas psycho deadpan is a perfect foil for Rogens slobbery cluelessness. But here both are damped down by the films now-its-goony-now-its-not game plan. That leaves the comic field to a large extent open to the supporting players such as Anna Faris who plays Brandi the tarty makeup-counter sales clerk Ronnie is desperately trying to impress or Celia Weston as Ronnies alcoholic mom. (She informs Ronnie sweetly that his birth drove his father away.) But even here Hill does not allow his actors to pull out all the stops as if any high emotion might be mistaken for burlesque. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Observe and Report Im not asking for another ""Paul Blart Mall Cop."" Im not even at least in theory asking for a comedy. Its just that ""Observe and Report"" is a lot better when its being funny than when its rummaging in the shadows. Rogen is not skillful enough to make Ronnies maniacal descent psychologically believable. Hes good at portraying the guys misplaced gallantry when it comes to helping out a beleaguered Toast-a-Bun salesgirl (Colette Wolfe) but too often he just seems zonked. Maybe he was afraid that if he actually utilized his facial muscles he might be mistaken for the Seth Rogen of old. Unless you really know what youre doing inexpressivity is a bad way for an actor to express himself.Almost every actor who has come out of comedy has felt the urge to enter the serioso sweepstakes. (Jim Carrey and Robin Williams are the most conspicuous cases.) But Rogen was more humanly believable - more ""serious"" if you will in ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" and ""Pineapple Express"" than he is here. (Speaking of weirdo comedies ""Pineapple Express"" which Rogen co-wrote ended with a shootem-up massacre that regardless of intentions was anything but hilarious.) Rogen and Hill are buying into the dubious but all-too-common assumption that dark is serious and light is well light.Its OK if you want to play Hamlet - even a mall cop Hamlet - but first you must earn your stripes. Grade B- (Rated R for pervasive language graphic nudity drug use sexual content and violence.)

While not the laugh riot some of my critical colleagues have been recklessly promising this second feature from Jody Hill (""The Foot Fist Way"") is admirable for venturing into very dark places rarely glimpsed in big-studio comedies -- thanks Warner Bros. -- like (gulp) date rape. MORE Lou Lumenicks Movie Blog PHOTOS Stoner Movies ""Part of me thinks this disgusting pervert is the best thing that ever happened to me"" announces Rogens Ronnie after a schlubby flasher begins terrorizing the low-rent Middle American mall where Ronnie is somehow director of security. The sick joke is that the flabby sociopathic Ronnie is neither physically nor mentally all that far removed from the very naked and modestly endowed flasher (Randy Gambill). The latters appearance inspires an attack of grandiosity in our hero whose transgressions up to now have been pretty much limited to racially harassing a lotion vendor he calls Saddam and cruelly leading on a temporarily handicapped barista (Collette Wolfe) who has a crush on him. In short order Ronnie guiltlessly forces himself on a wasted perfume demonstrator (Anna Faris) freaked out by the flasher joyfully tosses his medications for bipolar disorder -- and declares war on the police detective (Ray Liotta) investigating the flasher case. Further emboldened by a surprising law-enforcement triumph the mood-swinging Ronnie applies for a police job -- and this deluded bullys wildly inappropriate interview with a dumbfounded psychologist is perhaps the movies comic high point. Its possible to sympathize with our junk-food-loving hero -- mildly reminiscent of the sick cop played by Michael Rooker in Kevin Smiths 1995 flop ""Mallrats"" -- to a limited extent. Hes a product of a toxic environment spending his nights with a mother (Celia Weston quite brilliant) whos a falling-down drunk and spending his days with a lisping gung-ho lieutenant (Michael Pena better known for dramas like ""World Trade Center"") who is beyond weird. With a few tweaks ""Observe and Report"" could have been turned into a drama. And indeed Liotta plays it almost entirely straight in his most effective performance since ""Goodfellas."" He slowly goes from thinking Ronnie is a harmless nuisance to realizing he is something much much more dangerous. As the comedy ventures into territory involving serious use of deadly force you wonder just how far Hill and Rogen -- who unlike many comics does not hold back on the unpleasantness -- are going to push this. Is the ending a cop-out or welcome restraint? There will be debates about this. Either way this is not really a movie for the masses who went to see Rogen in ""Knocked Up"" -- or the wildly and inexplicably popular ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" for that matter. I dont want to oversell it but ""Observe and Report"" is the sort of offbeat studio movie that should be encouraged. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next 14M A SHOW Read Next 14M A SHOW Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 43458 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21101 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18381 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Observe and Report. (R) Warner Bros. (87 min.) Directed by Jody Hill. With Seth Rogen Anna Faris Michael Pena. Now playing in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS. ""Observe and Report"" is a Seth Rogen farce. It is also a movie about a socially maladjusted slightly delusional loner who falls in love with inappropriate blondes and looks for purpose -- and eventually redemption -- through vigilante violence. ""This may be the only comedy ever made that was inspired by Taxi Driver"" filmmaker Jody Hill has confessed. Probably. Although actually ""Taxi Driver"" had a lot of laughs -- even though not all of them were pleasant. Remember the scene with the fast-talking gun salesman? Or Travis idea of a romantic first date? So no ""Observe and Report"" -- which switches jobs from cabbie to mall cop -- isnt really a new comic spin on ""Taxi Driver."" But it is a dark little movie -- and a strange challenging step forward for Rogen. Rogens great advantage as an actor has always been his low-key schlubby amiability. Although the modern post-Belushi stereotype was for chubby comics to go all sweaty and manic Rogen has always held back sticking to self-deprecating mumbles. Its been extremely effective but he riskily abandons it here. Instead hes a clueless and fairly unlikable blowhard slow on the uptake and quick to offend. Hes recognizable as a character of course; for some perhaps a little too recognizable. But hes not very sympathetic. Then again nobody here really is. ""Observe and Report"" is only Jody Hills second feature but its generally misanthropic view already looms as an identifying attitude in his work -- and for mainstream audiences perhaps a particular problem. His last film was ""The Foot Fist Way"" and at the time I dubbed it a prime example of the tiresome new Moron Movie -- pictures (usually starring Will Ferrell) in which everyone is an idiot and the only humor comes from the audience reveling in its superiority. ""Observe and Report"" is another Moron Movie. Rogen is a Moron. So is Anna Faris who has the Cybill Shepherd part (if Shepherd were a trashy girl who worked the cosmetics counter). So is Michael Pena who plays Rogens friend. So is practically everyone else. The (almost) saving grace is that the actors find interesting ways to be unsympathetic. Faris embraces her inner slut (she really should be working with Christopher Guest; she has the kind of fearlessness he loves). Pena takes on a weird menacing lisp. Rogen plays it absolutely straight -- no hesitations no half-measures no desperate yearnings to be liked. Yet Hills film itself isnt quite as courageous. While it takes some self-conscious ""risks"" in terms of subjects (theres some racial stereotyping and a sex scene with a drunken drugged and nearly comatose woman) the story is actually a little conventional. Although for example Rogen is clearly meant to be unsympathetic in every way theres still a lovely innocent named Nell who looks at him with adoring eyes (because no actor wants to be seen as sexually unappealing). As for the ending -- well its as if Travis walked out of that East Village bloodbath to a cheering crowd. So in the end ""Observe and Report"" falls in the somewhat confusing middle -- guaranteed to annoy the mainstream while not quite delivering the final twist and bitter irony the true comic cultists crave. It is admittedly a sign of a real seriousness in Rogen who clearly wants to branch out. It may amuse Moron Movie fans and startle some rude laughs out of others. But however loudly and lewdly he shouts this cabbie -- excuse me security guard -- still isnt talkin to me. Rating note The film contains graphic nudity sexual situations substance abuse violence and strong language. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

But on close inspection (which is after all in the spirit of the thing) Paul Blart Mall Cop and Observe and Report appear to be the same movie. Each takes place in a mall Paul in New Jersey Observe in New Mexico. In each the hero is an overweight pathologically self-aggrandizing in-house security guard (Kevin James Seth Rogen) with a dopey name (Blart Ronnie Barnhardt) a problematic health condition (hypoglycemia bipolar disorder) and dreams of becoming a cop (state municipal). Neither carries a gun on the job a source of insecurity (Paul) and/or annoyance (Ronnie). Both men get around on two wheels (Segway motorcycle). Both lust after cuties (Jayma Mays Anna Faris) who work in the mall (cosmetics hair weaves). Both spend one key sequence getting incredibly stupendously trashed. Both live with their moms (Shirley Knight Celia Weston) though only Ronnies is drunk in every scene. Both pursue thieves with single-minded devotion to their craft -- and morph along the way into bone-crunching action heroes. See what I mean? Same movie. Of course only Observe and Report hinges its plot on the MO of a serial flasher and only Observe and Report shows his flapping totality front and center during a race through the mall. Its Ronnie not Paul who tells his mother ""This disgusting pervert is the best thing that ever happened to me."" And its Ronnie not Paul who volleys seven-letter invectives with a verbally abusive hand-cream salesman (Aziz Ansari) he nicknames ""Saddamn."" Ronnies pretty abusive himself for that matter. Written and directed by Jody Hill (The Foot Fist Way a nasty semi-hoot) Observe is a schlubby mall farce with a wide streak of sadism Most of its laughs ride on the cracked heads of crackheads cops and skateboarders. And while Im not above some really vicious slapstick theres a slim divide between humorous and off-putting hilarious and cruel. Sweetness is Rogens hallmark -- a vulgar sweetness cut with ganja but still -- and its a jolt to see him as a violently delusional ass-whupper on some kind of manic bender. It isnt all meant to be funny; yes Ronnies clonazepam is played for jokes but it also looks eerily like psycho-pharmaceutical product placement. Theres no mistaking the films larger message even while Queen is cranking away on the soundtrack. Rounding out this schizoid mash is a variably clownish supporting cast which runs from Ray Liotta as a meanie policeman (with that face-splitting Goodfellas crackle) to an inexplicably lisping Michael Pena (""Ya gotta thmarten up""). A few of the less repeatable lines hit their marks but the whole affair has the pasty-faced desperation of shoppers trapped in fluorescent light. Malls are not the most forgiving of places -- for swimsuit buyers or action-comedies.

When a flaccid flasher hits the mall parking lot and an after-hours thief strikes he gets the chance to prove he can serve and protect. Ray Liotta plays a detective who tires of Ronnie. You can bet hes never dreamed of being a rent-a-cop. Writer-director Jody Hill (""The Foot Fist Way"") is going for the dark comedy here. Ronnie is bigoted psychologically damaged potentially dangerous. Anna Faris cosmetic-counter meanie Brandi isnt much sounder. Michael Pena amuses (sort of) as he interprets Ronnies genius to co-workers John and Matt (John and Matt Yuan) twins with a yen for automatic weapons. Comedies that load up on disagreeable characters do so at their own risk. Hill has said ""Taxi Driver"" inspired him. OK. But fresh revelations about humans (however twisted) are scarce. ""Observe and Report"" is short on laughs even the bitter variety. It disturbs with a scene of date rape then weakly turns it into a pathetic joke. Ronnie is lonely. He overcompensates. He lives with his boozy mother. We get it hes flawed. So where to from that? Nowhere -- and fast. ""Observe and Report"" Written and directed by Jody Hill; photography by Tim Orr; starring Seth Rogen Ray Liotta Michael Pena Anna Faris Dan Bakkedahl Jesse Plemons. Rated R for pervasive language graphic nudity drug use sexual content and violence. 1 hour 22 minutes. Opens today at area theaters.

Comments click to enlarge Observe and Report Rated R  2009 Ive observed this Seth Rogen comedy and I can report that its not very good. Rogen had a pretty funny bit in Superbad as a jolly hard-partying cop who had trouble staying inside the law himself but that was a relatively fresh idea. This mean-spirited comedy by Jody Hill (also known for the overpraised The Foot Fist Way) casts the slovenly star as an officious security guard at a suburban mall and it follows this winters three-month run of Paul Blart Mall Cop. There are a few good knockabout moments and verbal riffs (e.g. Rogen and a nemesis tell each other ""Fuck you"" more times than you can count working the phrase to death). But Rogens character is too much of a dick--you never want to root for him and hes a cold fish with women (Celia Weston as his alcoholic mom Collette Wolfe as a snack bar cashier who adores him).

Pictures release.PHOTOGRAPHS TO ... more Photo Outnow.com Peter Sorel Peter Sorel Movie review Observe and Report 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Observe and Report Comedy. Starring Seth Rogen Ray Liotta and Anna Faris. Directed by Jody Hill. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Observe and Report"" is a step forward for comedy not a Neil Armstrong-size step maybe but big enough to notice. The movie presents Seth Rogen as a mall security guard with bipolar disorder who is dumb as a post and has delusions of grandeur and then it has the courage to develop a story around this guy thats as bleak and ridiculous as he seems to deserve. The movie never gets sentimental. Its as harsh and nasty as comedy can be and if anything it gets ruder and more outlandish as it goes along. Yet the acting - this is key - stays grounded in truth. The performances may be on the big side as they should be but they remain just this side of farce. Director Jody Hill who also wrote the screenplay maintains a very precise tone by making sure the actors never once behave as though they know theyre funny. That Rogen was willing to embrace this approach shows unusual maturity and confidence. He plays Ronnie - off his meds and boiling with hostility - as though he were merely a great man whos misunderstood. On several occasions Ronnies life falls apart and its barely funny at all. Called upon to play devastation Rogen plays devastation with no winks and no exaggerations. What emerges is a complex character the portrait of a man of huge aspiration and minimal ability whose self-conception is that of a strong man with a mission to protect the weak. Another gutsy move Ronnie is hardly sympathetic. Hes a moron and a nuisance and occasionally a bully and the movie does nothing to make him likable beyond an honest illumination of the character - that he has deep needs and his moral code is consistent. ""Observe and Report"" is funnier than the silliest comedy because its surprisingly real. Rogen isnt alone out there. Anna Faris delivers a tour de force as Brandi the trashy cosmetics counter girl who becomes the object of Ronnies fascination. They have a date scene in which she progressively becomes more wasted and its flat-out hysterical one of the funniest scenes in months because its clear that Faris is grounding this drug-abusing amoral slut on very slick detailed comic observation. A flasher is making repeat appearances in the mall parking lot going around in the classic trench coat and terrorizing (and disgusting) women. This triggers all the fault lines of Ronnies personality - his need to be important and his vision of himself as a warrior and a protector. He sees this as his case even when a police detective (Ray Liotta) is called in. Ronnie a couple of eggs short of an omelet becomes convinced that the detective is blowing the investigation. Actually the real worry with ""Observe and Report"" is that the writer-director might blow it. He gives us an unpleasant protagonist and a style of humor thats harsh almost to the point of cruelty. He gives Ronnie a falling-down drunk for a mother (Celia Weston) who comes on to his friends. He gives Ronnie a substance-abusing lover who throws up on her pillow. Yet throughout I kept dreading the pivot the phony ending out of a Jim Carrey or Will Ferrell movie where the nutty protagonist suddenly becomes inexplicably capable. The innovation of ""Observe and Report"" - its one small step for comedy - is that it finds its way to a satisfying ending without compromising an audiences (or its own) sense of truth. After all truth in comedy is why we laugh - were startled by it and laughter is the response. Yet truth itself in the sense of the publics perception of reality is always evolving and shifting and comedy always has to keep pace. ""Observe and Report"" strikes me as a comedy in perfect pace with this moment. Its funny and uncompromising offering laughs without denial. -- Advisory This film contains strong language drug use and sexual situations.

"Observe and Report Seth Rogens mall crawl | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsObserve and Report Seth Rogens mall crawlJody Hill the writer/director of the appalling Observe and Report  is telling everyone who will listen that his movie is nothing like Paul Blart Mall Cop .As loathsome mall cop Ronnie Barnhardt Seth Rogen deals in racism sexism profanity and violence in Observe and Report.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. April 10 2009 Observe and Report (out of 4)Starring Seth Rogen Ray Liotta Anna Faris Michael Pena and Collette Wolfe. Written and directed by Jody Hill. 86 minutes. At major theatres. 18A Jody Hill the writer/director of the appalling Observe and Report is telling everyone who will listen that his movie is nothing like Paul Blart Mall Cop.Hill is wrong about the details - there are many coincidental similarities - but hes bang-on about the bigger picture. Paul Blart is no classic but its funny engaging and even a little bit inspiring. Observe and Report is none of these things.Its a sick fantasy about a loathsome mall cop named Ronnie Barnhardt played against type by the usually adorable Seth Rogen whose oversized ego is the inverse of his crew-cut-covered pea brain. Consumed by rage and feelings of inadequacy - he lives at home with his drunken mom (Celia Weston) - the tightly wound Ronnie treats his suburban Forest Ridge Mall as a battlefield. Barnhardt advocates using guns Tasers and billy clubs to settle any dispute big or small.It beggars credulity to think a man this unhinged would be allowed in a civilized society to get away with the sociopathic acts Ronnie commits - which include date rape scores of brutal beatings (police officers included) and possibly even a few killings (he brags of six). Yet Ronnie continues to offend drawing only scoldings from his indulgent boss.Hill evidently intends his film to be satirical. But satire even the absurd variety requires intelligence to succeed. Observe and Report has a moronic sense of humour trading in racism sexism profanity and violence at every predictable turn. Ronnies anger-management issues are blamed on his bipolar condition - another crude stereotype.Anna Faris does what she does in so many movies of this ilk she plays the dumb blonde for whom no indignity is too much in the cause of cheap yuks. She crosses the line with her salesclerk character Brandi the object of Ronnies lust. She binges on alcohol and prescription pills and then falls unconscious while Ronnie rapes her. She later shrugs it all off.How is this remotely funny? The only honest laughs this movie draws are nervous chuckles. The one scintilla of cleverness about this vile set-up is the casting of Ray Liotta as street cop Det. Harrison who becomes Ronnies rival and nemesis during competing manhunts for a parking-lot flasher (who gives frequent full-frontal to up the films ""ugh"" factor). Liotta is often saddled with the psycho roles but his Harrison maintains a brusque reserve and remains reasonably tethered to reality.Not so Rogens Ronnie who is so far removed from real life and from the comic actors comfort zone as to be in danger of threatening his career.He deserves a half star for bravery for accepting such an unsympathetic role but he may well look back on Observe and Report in years to come as the final deal-breaker with his audience. Yes this is no Paul Blart Mall Cop. Even the films archly ironic title cant match the direct appeal of its predecessor. Instead of Observe and Report it should be titled Abuse and Revile.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The road is littered with failed attempts and for every Cruel Intentions there are a few dozen Pushing Tin and Cable Guy efforts convincing studios not to fund them. Regardless of what the trailers tell you Observe and Report wants very desperately to be a dark comedy. But it doesnt quite get there as its not funny enough to hit the comedy dismount and not clever enough to go fully dark. Its much more like pudding actually -- soft free of structure and not very filling. Seth Rogen is a mall security guard. To the films credit the title is never used. Also to the films credit is that this is just a story about a crazy dude. Rogens Ronnie Barnhardt is a slightly stupid partially mentally ill and fully delusional fellow who can only be taken seriously in that he has moderate amounts of power to lord over consumers and fellow mall employees. Hes joined in the cast by Anna Faris playing a ditzy blonde and Ray Liotta as a hard-boiled detective. An essential cameo is turned in by Parks and Recreations Aziz Ansari (who really should be a bigger star by now) while Collette Wolfe is also eminently watchable as a girl with a broken leg working at the donut shop. Every day she gives Rogen free coffee -- small scenes that work well at building both character and providing awkward laughs. The other highlight is the soundtrack although its used as an expository feature a bit too often. Still as a standalone offering Id recommend a listen. Its got a solid Bob Dylan cover a good Pixies Cover and a righteous 40-year-old track called ""Brain"" from 60s Brit band the Action that acquits itself well even against todays modern rock offerings. The film falters when Observe and Report goes for the big laughs. Its not clear whether we should be sympathetic horrified or entertained. Vonnegut recommended having characters who wanted something so the audience could take the journey with them. What does Ronnie Barnhardt want? Well he clearly wants to get laid. No surprise there but that joke predates the written word. He kinda/sorta wants to be a police officer and the script makes a halfhearted effort to show that side too. Hed like to be made fun of a little less but this too comes in fits and starts. Unlike say the clarity of 40-Year-Old Virgin (older gent wants to get laid) Knocked Up (layage has happened consequences ensue) or Superbad (young gents want to enjoy sexual relations) Observe and Report has no real throughline which creates distance from Rogen to the audience. Its a situation where its easy to check out from the material. Im not advocating more sex comedies mind you just a bit of focus where writer Jody Hill is concerned (as his other theatrical project The Foot Fist Way had the exact same issue). So then should you see this film? Its not tremendously disappointing if you havent seen a comedy in a while and just need something to tide you over. But youre not going to get great quotes or belly laughs out of this action and in two years this wont be mentioned at all. Ideally it will be considered one of Rogens lesser works because I have high hopes for him. Hes a convincing everyman and in the right hands he gives an audience a ton to latch on to. The fact that this slips away like greasy spaghetti isnt the fault of anything more than a directionless plot.

Starring Seth Rogen Anna Faris Ray Liotta Michael Pena Dan Bakkedahl Jesse Plemons Director Jody Hill Running time 126  Editorial Review Cruel unfunny and yet somehow perversely fascinating ""Observe and Report"" must have been conceived as ""Taxi Driver"" with belly laughs and its hero as a hybrid of Norman Bates and Barney Fife. But given that the ordinarily likable Seth Rogen is portraying a delusional violent sexist racist homophobic mall cop with a bipolar disorder theres not really a lot to laugh at.Written and directed by Jody Hill (whose ""Eastbound amp; Down"" is an HBO attraction) ""Observe and Report"" is the logical conclusion of the loser comedy losers of the like portrayed by Adam Sandler Jim Carrey and the late Chris Farley. Those losers however always possess some modicum of charm. Not Ronnie Barnhardt (Rogen) a guy who can be described only by using an epithet not allowed in this newspaper.As head of security at the Forest Ridge Mall Ronnie personifies every rent-a-cop cliche from the delusions of grandeur to the gun-nuttiness to a burning desire to be a real detective. He sexually harasses Brandi (Anna Faris) the makeup-counter clerk. When a flasher shows up in the mall parking lot Ronnie decides to take over the case.Not only is Ronnie a character you dont care about hes a character you dont want to be around. If he were your neighbor youd move. Ronnies liqueur-swilling mother (Celia Weston) tells him his father left because of Ronnies ""special needs""; during an interview at the police academy he admits that hes bipolar.Inspired by love for Brandi he decides to go off his meds. At that point what happens is so ridiculously violent and uncomedic that you just might laugh but only out of shock and awe. Of course its not as if Wes Craven had directed ""Observe and Report."" But if he had it would have been a lot funnier.-- John Anderson (April 10 2009)Contains violence drugs rampant vulgarity sex and nudity.

PicturesRating R for pervasive language graphic nudity drug use sexual content and violenceRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY A peripheral character comments in Observe and Report ""I thought this would be funny but its actually kind of sad."" The sentiment sums up a good portion of this hit-and-miss comedy starring Seth Rogen as a delusional security guard. Though its more darkly humorous than the inane unfunny Paul Blart Mall Cop Observe and Report lacks the wit of many of Rogens previous comedies. MORE Careerwise Seth Rogen likes what hes seeing Its biggest asset is the way it sidesteps predictability and focuses its tale on unlikely and unhinged characters. Rogen plays Ronnie the head of security for the Forest Ridge Mall. Ronnie lacks the efficiency of even a buffoon like Paul Blart. But he makes up for it in bluster. Though Ronnie is more dysfunctional than endearing you still root for him. This may say more about Rogens likability than that of the character he plays. Some of the funnier conceits involve Ronnies relationship with his alcoholic mother (Celia Weston) and his overtures to Brandi (Anna Faris) a salesgirl he lusts for. Faris will seemingly go to any lengths for a laugh. As will Rogen so theyre a good match. Much of the movie centers on the antics of a heavyset flasher who clambers around the malls parking lot. When he exposes himself to Brandi Ronnie intervenes like a knight in tarnished armor. Mostly he just makes her paranoid. But he does manage to get a boozy date out of it. The exhibitionist also draws the heavy guns. Ray Liotta plays a smug police detective and Ronnies psychological problems worsen in his presence. An altercation between Ronnie and a crack dealer (Danny McBride Rogens co-star in Pineapple Express) is comical before it fizzles. When Observe and Report is funny its often shockingly so. The characters can be nasty or self-absorbed yet they still have a whiff of sweetness. The bipolar Ronnie sometimes seems in dire need of psychiatric care. Other times hes pathetic. The humor wanes when sad moments overtake the absurd. Writer/director Jody Hill did a better job with The Foot Fist Way which starred McBride. Both films feature deluded fools with underlying psychological problems. Observe and Report is hampered by opening so soon after Mall Cop and by their superficial similarities. Both Blart and Ronnie want to be cops. Both have crushes on comely mall clerks. But where Mall Cop is broad safe and sticks to a formula Observe and Report is unabashedly crude cynical off-kilter and funnier. Still you wonder why the world needs two tales months apart of twisted and inept security guards.

About an hour into Observe and Report mall cop Ronnie Barnhardt (Seth Rogen) has finally achieved his dream and taken the blonde egotistical doltish perfume saleslady Brandi (Anna Faris) to bed basically by getting her drunk. Problem is shes pretty much passed out her puke staining the pillow as Ronnie happily obliviously churns away. He pauses for a moment to notice her comatose state and without opening her eyes Brandi mutters ""Whyd you stop malefactor?"" Or a 12-letter word to that effect. Now thats character comedy I mean tragedy I mean tromedy of the highest I mean lowest I mean high-lowest order. Beyond the weirdness if you can get there is a quick portrait of trailer-park America pursuing its urges by any means necessary. Its clear that Ronnie no babe magnet will take what he can get on this night of nights even if its not quite the exalted ecstasy he had hoped for; and that Brandi whos been in this position once or twice before wants the sexual exercise even if shes not awake to take an active role in it -- somewhere in her stupor shes feeling a rote rumble of pleasure. The scene achieves what few American movies even attempt to pinpoint the grim compromise the desperation that can attend the sex act. Dont call it love; dont call it grand; but whatever it is dont stop. (See pictures of Seth Rogen.) That minute or so is the finest thing in Observe and Report and if it doesnt strike you as funny-peculiar you may as well stop reading now. Most of the rest of the movie is standard-issue comedy rowdiness with one twist the hero is borderline bananas. Ronnie chief security guard at the Forest Ridge Mall takes his job waaay too seriously. He bullies his staff like the drill sergeant in Full Metal Jacket. He thinks his men should be armed with assault rifles not just Mace and Tasers. He patrols the mall as if its Baghdad and al-Qaeda is around the corner. He shrugs off robberies of the mall stores but thinks the escapades of a flasher (Randy Gambill) are the start of World War III. He hears voices in his head and theyre not happy. Hes the polar -- actually bipolar -- opposite of nice nebbishy Paul Blart in this years most popular comedy. Ronnie is Travis Bickle Mall Cop. (See an interview with Seth Rogen.) In most guy-oriented comedies originality is the merest wrinkle. (What if this 40-year-old man were ... a virgin?) Give writer-director Jody Hill two cheers for asking What if we did a workplace comedy and the focus of our attention and sympathy were on a fellow -- played by Rogen everyones favorite jovial slob -- who is this close to the simmering psycho Robert De Niro played in Taxi Driver? The gun love the quiet surliness the loner status the head whisperings the mistaken fashioning of other peoples motives into paranoid scenarios -- all echo the violent cabbie in Martin Scorseses movie whose script was inspired by the diary of Arthur Bremer the would-be assassin of Governor George Wallace. Like Travis Ronnie has two women in his life though he is only peripherally in theirs. Travis had the blonde goddess he dreamed of (played by Cybill Shepherd) and the girl he wanted to protect (Jodie Foster). For Ronnie Brandi is the woman he aspires to -- he says with feeling ""Shes the prettiest girl in this entire mall if not the world"" -- though in Faris acute performance her dull eyes and sour turn of mouth tell us she should be placed not on a pedestal but in the trash bin. And Nell (Colette Wolfe) is the nicest girl Ronnie doesnt quite notice a smiling saintly abused cripple of near Dickensian poignancy. See the top 10 movie bromances of all time.

"Observe and Report is the feel-weird comedy of the season. Slate Sign In Sign Up Observe and Report is the feel-weird comedy of the season. Observe and Report is the feel-weird comedy of the season. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 9 2009 732 PM Observe and Report The feel-weird comedy of the season By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Observe and Report click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Seth Rogen as Ronnie in Observe and Report Observe and Report(Warner Bros.) is messing with my head. Leaving the screening I was convinced that the movie was a failure both cloddish in its intentions and inept in its execution with two or three darkly funny gags and possibly the most disturbing ending to a comedy ever. The next morning I wondered if I might not be half-wrong. Was it possible that director Jody Hill did have some interesting ideas about teasing out the latent psychosexual sadism of the cop movie--ideas that the studios fear of unmarketable unpleasantness or Hills own mishandling had kept him from exploring fully and coherently? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Once that door of doubt had been opened my relation to the movie became totally vertiginous. Who was to say the movie hadnt succeeded on its own bizarre and inscrutable terms? Was it Hill who wasnt sure what movie he wanted to make or me who wasnt sure what movie I was seeing? Like that brain-eating bug that Ricardo Montalban puts in Chekovs ear in Star Trek The Wrath of Khan this nasty little comedy is slowly making itself at home in my skull. By the end of the day I may be blurbing it rapturously for a full-page ad in Variety ""The feel-weird comedy of the season"" Advertisement One fixed truth I can hang onto in this maelstrom of contradictory reactions to Observe and Report is that Seth Rogen is miscast in it. (Or is he? Maybe that miscastness is precisely what Hill intended. Ah shut up brain.) As Ronnie Barnhardt the bipolar and delusional head of security at Forest Ridge Mall Rogen goes deeper than he ever has--and thats not a good thing. As it turns out Seth Rogens actorly depths do not require sonar to be sounded. In fairness to the Rogester Ronnie Barnhardt is a tough nut to crack. He must be unhinged and pitiable frightening and funny morally repellent and yet identifiably human something like Robert DeNiros Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy. There arent a lot of actors alive who could play Rupert Pupkin; even DeNiro himself now in his later broader phase might have lost the knack. But theres someone who could have nailed Ronnie Barnhardt for half Seth Rogens salary Hills muse Danny McBride who appears briefly in Observe and Report as a Latino crack dealer. McBride who played a megalomaniacal tae kwon do instructor in Hills self-financed debut The Foot Fist Way and is now starring as a retired baseball player in Hills HBO series Eastbound and Down has a knack for seeming at once achingly vulnerable and frighteningly deranged. Rogen can do the vulnerability but not the derangement His comic center has always been his sanity the sense he gives of being the lone earthbound pragmatist wryly observing the surrounding folly. So then Ronnie Barnhardt. Like the hero of the thematically similar but tonally antithetical Paul Blart Mall Cop Ronnie is a failed police-academy student who takes his retail security job far too seriously. But unlike the benign and cuddlesome Blart Ronnie is also an unapologetic asshole and a scary sonofabitch. He lords his petty authority over his ""Special Elite Task Force"" of fellow mall cops the fanatically loyal Dennis (Michael Pena) and gun-crazed identical twins John and Matt Yuen (played in a nifty casting joke by gun-crazed identical twins John and Matt Yuan). After a trenchcoated flasher exposes himself to several mall patrons and employees including Brandi (Anna Faris) the makeup-counter clerk of Ronnies dreams Ronnie vows to track down the pantsless offender at all costs. The real cop assigned to the case (a glowering perfectly cast Ray Liotta) takes a fancy to the dimwitted Brandi and he and Ronnie enter into a bitter rivalry to win her affections and catch the flasher. Observe and Report has already become a movie about which people are staking out positions. On the Daily Beast Varietys Anne Thompson calls  Observe and Report ""a realistic indie action comedy"" that ""deconstructs movie cliches about hero fantasy."" Those confidently asserted genre categories suggest a far greater control of tone (and a more cerebral approach) than Jody Hill either achieves or intends. New York magazines Dan Kois makes a persuasive case  that Ronnies tequila-and-Klonopin-enhanced night of sex with a nearly unconscious Brandi is by any reasonable standard rape. Id argue a little queasily that by the unreasonable standards of this movies alternate moral universe Brandis midscene exhortation--""Did I tell you to stop motherfucker?""--constitutes consent. (It certainly constitutes one of the movies biggest laugh lines.) Advertisement But Kois is right when he points out that whatever you call what Ronnie does to Brandi its far from being the most unpleasant act his character engages in. In an interview Jody Hill has observed that in focus-group screenings the scenes that haters called the most offensive were the exact same ones that fans found the funniest. Ronnies scenes with his falling-down drunk of a mother played by fearless stage actress Celia Weston get laughs by taking the dysfunctional-but-loving family trope to places few comedies would dare. (""Remember when I soiled myself the other night?"" she asks him tenderly. ""You were really there for me."") And while I had trouble locating the chuckles in a scene where Ronnie and his mall-cop pal beat up a group of skateboarding teens while on a drug bender Hill certainly cant be faulted for pulling his punches. The final chase scene--you can listen to the ""Spoiler Special"" podcast above for details--shifts abruptly from uproarious raunch to nauseating gore then ends on a note of triumph thats curiously out of keeping with the movies own logic. All along weve been watching Ronnie slowly hoist himself on the petard of his own unchecked aggression. For there to be even a hint of redemption (and depending how you read the last scene there may be way more than a hint) throws everything that came before into question and breaks an unwritten contract with the viewer. Whats meant (I think) to be a ""fuck you"" to action-movie conventions reads instead as a ""fuck you"" to the audience.

Nightly.But still she loves her son and he loves her and there you have the essence of filmmaker Jody Hills profiles in self-delusion and dysfunction Offer up weird stuff deliver it with dark twisted subversive glee but make sure everybody has their heart in the right place.Observe and Report which is as funny as it is sick (and its plenty of both) stars Seth Rogen as Ronnie Barnhardt a bipolar law-enforcement dude patrolling the Forest Ridge Mall with his walkie-talkie and his Taser. (Hes been lobbying for firearms but his boss has wisely demurred.) Ronnies got a thing for Brandi (Anna Faris) a ditzy cosmetic-counter salesgirl and when a flasher starts terrorizing patrons in the parking lot Ronnie takes the crime personally. Its a challenge to his authority not to mention to his (imagined) girlfriends psychological well-being.So Ronnie sets out to protect Brandi from this perv and to prove that hes better equipped to apprehend the culprit than the local authorities are. Especially Detective Harrison (a deadpan Ray Liotta) who rolls up to the mall to interview witnesses - Ronnie looking on shaking his head seething with contempt.In between getting loaded on the job violently harassing skateboarders and philosophizing with his loopy lispy mall-cop partner Dennis (Michael PeA+-a) Ronnie does his utmost to capture the flasher. Rogen working against his usual affable schlub type role projects a wonderfully warped and dangerous vibe. Ronnie is alienated arrogant deluded - and still you love the guy.Kind of.Writer/director Hill has a knack for painting protagonists who are full of unjustified confidence and obnoxious hauteur - simultaneously mocking them and empathizing with them. He pulled this deft stunt off in 2008s lost goofball gem The Foot Fist Way with Danny McBride as a self-assured martial-arts instructor/nincompoop. (Paramount Vantage didnt have a clue how to market the film - it came and went in the blink of an eye.)Observe and Report works on a slightly bigger scale with bigger stars but takes the same approach. And there are more than a few scenes where youll be shaking your head in disbelief at the moral horror confronting you - a drunken seduction scene between Rogen and Faris is perhaps the topper.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Say this for Jody Hills disturbing black comedy Observe And Report When its over you know youve seen something. Something of a cross between the formalist whimsy of Wes Anderson and the Gods-lonely-man psychosis of Taxi Driver the film breaks all the rules but the tonal schizophrenia that results isnt an accident. Hill means to unsettle viewers by confusing the fantasies of an overzealous mall security guard with the bitter down-to-earth reality of his pathetic unhinged desperation. The trouble with Observe And Report is that Hill tries to have it both ways He presents a hero whos hopelessly deluded and dangerous yet he indulges those delusions too and turns them into a bizarre sort of wish-fulfillment. In the end its hard to know how he feels about the man. Cut from the same cloth as Danny McBrides strip-mall sensei in Hills overrated debut feature The Foot Fist Way Seth Rogen stars as the doughy crew-cut head of security at an average suburban mall. Where most would consider the place a harmless commune of Sunglass Huts and Dress Barns Rogen sees the nexus of good and evil casting himself as the iron-fisted arbiter of justice. When a flasher terrorizes a few customers in the parking lot--including Rogens Cybill Shepherd a bitchy makeup-counter beauty played by Anna Faris--Rogen springs into action but his heavy-handed tactics get in the way of Ray Liottas official police investigation. With Liotta as his bete noire Rogen even tries to legitimize his quest by pursuing a position in the police department. Not since Paul Thomas Andersons Punch-Drunk Love has a studio comedy so willfully punctuated fantasy with shocking violence. One minute it takes a hard look at Rogen as the sad beaten-down deluded son of an alcoholic; the next it asks the audience to cheer as he mercilessly thrashes skate-punks with their own boards. Taken piecemeal there are many brilliantly funny scenes and sequences--one where Rogen follows his right-hand man (Michael Pena) into rogue territory is a particular highlight--and on a technical level Hill has advanced immeasurably over the shoestring sloppiness of Foot Fist Way. But as a whole Observe And Report is indigestible torn apart by the same mass of contradictions that give it distinction.

Anna Faris left and Seth Rogen are shown in a scene from ""Observe and Report."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint There wont be a more polarizing comedy released in 2009 than ""Observe and Report."" This audacious subversive action comedy turns two of our cuddliest performers Seth Rogen and Anna Faris into poster kids for atrocious misbehavior. Writer/director Jody Hill knows that disgusting and hilarious can be two sides of a very thin coin. Rogen plays Ronnie a blustery incompetent who is the head of security at Forest Ridge shopping mall. Hes a genuinely scary clown an underdog with a vicious streak and the soul of a vigilante. When a serial flasher starts exposing himself in the parking lot Ronnie becomes a one-man war on terror. ""Part of me thinks this disgusting pervert is the best thing that ever happened to me"" he crows.  Ronnie uses the security threat to unleash his inner bad-ass. The heightened threat level provides him an excuse to go Dirty Harry on anyone who annoys him. And it gives him a chance to strut in front of Brandi (Faris) a makeup-counter hottie who seems to have stumbled out of a ""Girls Gone Wild"" video. If he catches the exhibitionist Ronnie figures hes a shoo-in to land his dream job as a policeman.  But when real cop Detective Harrison (Ray Liotta) steps into the case our cocky antihero faces a threat to his jurisdiction and a rival for Brandis attention (short as it is). Rogen and Faris commit fully to their appalling roles. He proves that he can play characters darker and more complicated than his usual lovable klutz and she is a good sport about looking disturbingly vulgar and trashy. The moment when she upchucks after a ""date"" of tequila shots and he chivalrously proclaims ""I accept you"" sealing the deal with a deep lingering kiss is unnerving and uproarious. The director whose made his debut last year with the low-budget comedy ""The Foot Fist Way"" skillfully toys with our instinct to identify with Ronnie while keeping our emotions off balance. Ronnie is initially sympathetic; hes been dealt a bad hand in life. His mom is a lush hes romantically clueless and his dream of joining the force seems unattainable. But the terse macho voiceovers that narrate his daily grind reveal the fury beneath his roly-poly exterior. ""In these dark times the world has no use for another scared man"" he declares. Hes like the pompous man-child heroles of Will Ferrell movies but with psychological problems and a gun fetish. OBSERVE AND REPORT  out of 4 stars Rating R for pervasive language graphic nudity drug use sexual content and violence. When Harrison drops Ronnie off in a bad part of town to give him a taste of real police work the comic payoff is all the stronger because its so unexpectedly brutal. Lily livers and weak stomachs look out. Those willing to step outside the comfort zone of run-of-the-mill comedy should check it out.  ""I live by a code of my own invention"" Ronnie explains and so does ""Observe and Report.""

"Rogen more Dirty Harry than teddy bear in Observe and Report - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW Observe and Report Star is more Dirty Harry than teddy bear in Report Anna Faris and Seth Rogen in the comedy Observe and Report. (WARNER BROTHERS) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / April 10 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + I know I know. Another month another doofus-mall-cop movie. How do these things happen? ""Observe and Report"" which opens today and stars Seth Rogen has been pre-mocked as ""Paul Blart 2."" But this new movie is crazier scarier funnier and more bewildering. Its the strangest movie I expect to see from a Hollywood studio for the rest of the year.Any film that opens with a riotous sequence of a flabby flasher whipping open his trench coat and spewing obscene commands at women in a mall parking lot has done something right. Its not just that ""Observe and Report"" begins with this flasher whom Randy Gambill plays with a necessary lack of inhibition. Its that the filmmaking balances the awfulness and comedy of the event. The urgency in the handheld cameras attempt to keep up with the flasher the horror in the faces of the women the general beauty of the day (the sun brings out the orange in the perverts hair) - its lewd and wonderful a perfect John Waters afternoon.That opening sequence also lays out the uneasy blend of harmlessness and real danger that writer-director Jody Hill tries to build into ""Observe and Report"" his second film after last years ""The Fist Foot Way."" The flasher gives Ronnie Barnhardt (Rogen) something to obsess over. Ronnie works security at a fictitious everymall. He lives with his alcoholic mother (Celia Weston) and spends his downtime at a gun club wishing alongside his twin co-workers (John and Matt Yuan) for the right to bear arms on the job. He also may be bipolar.From the early going it seems that Rogen will be doing more of his abrasive teddy bear routine - unprintable commentary followed by a moment of sensitivity. Often with Rogen his vulnerability makes his coarseness safe. He gets away with insulting Katherine Heigl or Elizabeth Banks because they will tame his heart. Ronnie is something altogether new for Rogen. Vulnerability never arrives. Hes shameless.Not far into the movie Ronnie saunters over to his crush Brandi (Anna Faris) the flamboyantly blond dipstick who works at a department store cosmetics counter to warn her about the flasher. He winds up being insulting. Rogens normal awkward self-awareness doesnt kick in. Ronnie doesnt realize his foot is in his mouth. His profanity extends to the sweet girl Nell (Collette Wolfe) who makes his coffee and also endures the verbal abuse of her boss (Pat ton Oswalt). She appears to love Ronnies casual putdowns all the same.After that first encounter with Nell I wondered where Hill was taking this - the gunplay the indecent exposure Ronnies cruelties the pitch-perfect calibration of Fariss obnoxiousness.While it incorporates the shallow gag-oriented style of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" ""Observe and Report"" becomes increasingly dark and the movie struggles to balance the whimsical and the psychotic. The result is a tone-deaf black comedy that in the 1970s would have been a grisly thriller - ""Dirty Harry"" or ""Taxi Driver"" - and by the 1980s would have been ""Rambo."" Ronnie is as reactionary as Harry Callahan but as delusional as Travis Bickle. He has altercations with everyone from the American Arab kid (Aziz Ansari) who mans a massage cart to the aggravated detective (Ray Liotta terrific) investigating a shoplifting case that Ronnie is determined to solve himself.The character is a frustrating creation partly because hes crazy partly because Hill and Rogen seem unsure of just how crazy to make him. When Ronnie goes nuts on a drug gang its funny because the two sides of the law are clear. His verbal assaults on Nell are a different matter. Theyre personal. Say what you will about Travis Bickle he knew how to treat a lady.The line here between crusading man-child and menace to society is perilously thin. Yet as with ""Taken"" or for that matter any of the ""Police Academy"" movies Ronnies commitment to justice is crowd-pleasing if certain to result in lawsuits. A braver more outraged movie might have made this character a victim of the economy. But this frustrated cop (he fails a police psychological exam with flying colors) has no higher moral calling. He craves the thrill of war and the adoration of the public he claims to protect Rambo with pre-traumatic stress disorder. If Ronnie ever makes it out of this fictional shopping center to a mall near you laugh. Then run for your life.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

(Sorel/WB) Joe Neumaier Friday April 10 2009 216 AM Title Observe and Report A mall security guard goes after a flasher. With Seth Rogen Anna Faris Ray Liotta. (125). R Violence nudity drug use language. At area theaters. A man takes a job and that job becomes what he is"" said the veteran driver Wizard to deranged vigilante-in-waiting Travis Bickle in 1976s ""Taxi Driver."" Ronnie Barnhardt the obsessed-with-justice mall cop antihero of ""Observe and Report"" may have taken Wizards advice too literally. But its for the best because as this funny violent and refreshingly offbeat dark comedy goes on it is as Travis might say a rain that washes most generic Hollywood laughs off the screen.This isnt ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2"" and its not the movie the ads make it out to be (even the title is too bland). There is an addictive at times vicious eccentricity at work here and it begins with Seth Rogen. He brings to Ronnie something that always seems to lurk unacknowledged in his performances even the ""lovable"" ones like that in ""Knocked Up"" the creepy overeagerness of a guy whose quick smile and hyperverbal delivery may mean hes off his meds.Ronnie is definitely that -- when he stops taking pills for unexplained ills he makes even more finger rifles and ""Boom"" noises at shoppers -- as well as socially awkward aggressive lonely and unpredictable. To his mind though a few of those traits may be his secret weapon in nabbing a flasher whos targeting the innocent women of Forest Ridge Mall.When the latest victim is Brandi (Anna Faris) the drinkin ditz Ronnie loves from across her cosmetics counter the big guys delusional sense of heroism is heightened even more despite being recently rejected by the police department due to past ""issues."" Plus the local detective (Ray Liotta) insists this is no job for a rent-a-cop.In a film full of oddballs these three get the most attention. Yet that shouldnt stop us from appreciating the born-again virgin working in the food court (Collette Wolfe) Ronnies happily alcoholic mother (Celia Weston) or his partner Dennis played by Michael Pena in an exquisitely weird performance that grows on you.Writer-director Jody Hill loads the soundtrack with quirky musical choices and doesnt renege on the films promise. (""Taxi Driver"" was in fact an inspiration and theres a bit of early Coen brothers here as well.) This is real love-it-or-hate-it territory what with the movies gun love naked cruelty and damaged psyches. It also contains Rogens best work and another engaging turn from Faris always willing to be extreme for a laugh (the two share a shocking scene that will surely be the years most offensive date moment). While it stops before sliding too far into the darkness ""Observe and Report"" hits a lot of bulls-eyes by aiming for the gut not thankfully the familiar belly laugh.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie review Observe and Report -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Observe and Report -- 3 out of 5 stars Observe and Report Peter Sorel / Warner Bros. Peter Sorel / Warner Bros. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic All malls may be created equal with the same array of Gaps Body Shops and J.C. Penneys from Bangor to Boca. But all mall cop movies arent. Seth Rogens Observe and Report is Paul Blart Mall Cop Strikes Back a dark comedy with ""issues.""Rogen takes his frustrated ""real cop"" wannabe into angry profane and seriously anti-social places that the dimwitted Blart would never go. Observe and Report is a funnier movie but also an unhappier one. The star and members of the team that made The Foot Fist Way and Pineapple Express find their laughs in flashers (full frontal nudity) firing range fantasies cocaine crudity and simple shock value. This profane rude irresponsible medication-ignoring bi-polar buffoon has little grounding in mall reality. Or one would hope. But hes funny.Rogen is Ronnie Barnhardt a rent-a-badge ""head of mall security"" at Forest Ridge Mall. Hes touchy about labels. He may not get to carry a gun but call him a ""security guard"" and deal with his profane wrath. ""We got Tasers. We got mace. Its not bad"" he tells his troops who include Michael Pena (World Trade Center) a snicker in his first big comic role.Whatever his work misgivings Ronnies mall has a flasher and that gives Ronnie purpose. He must protect the fair Brandi. Anna Faris a Pamela Anderson with talent gives this cosmetics-counter bombshell a brazen tequila shots-pounding verve. Shes shallow but still isnt falling for Ronnies tactless politically incorrect come-ons. But Nell (Collette Wolfe) the donut-shop girl next door just might.The flasher and a burglary bring Ronnie into conflict with a real cop played by Ray Liotta on a slow burn.But as similar as the characters and many of the plot points are to Mall Cop writer-director Jody Hill (The Foot Fist Way) never shies from taking Observe into the dark recesses of Ronnies bi-polar mind. Ronnie and the boys hit the shooting range with all manner of deadly weapons. Dumping him in the worst neighborhood in town (Danny McBride plays a drug dealer) doesnt turn out the way youd expect. His drunken mom (the great Celia Weston) may fret over his medication when shes sober enough to remember. Without his meds Ronnie is even more delusional than usual. And violent.""Im a cook and Im serving up justice""The movies sinister streak makes it impossible to cozy up to and Rogens performance -- despite a surprising athletic competence (fights stunts) -- is clumsier than usual owing to the actor-playing-poseur nature of the role.But in its own demented Pineapple-Foot Fist-Four Letter Word Way Observe and Report delivers a cynical angry and funny take on a life of loud violent desperation.Roger Moore can be reached at 407-420-5369 or rmooreorlandosentinel.com.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Peter Sorel) A- Observe and Report Genre Comedy; Starring Anna Faris Seth Rogen Ray Liotta Michael Pena; Director Jody Hill; Author Jody Hill; Release Date Wide 04/10/2009; Runtime (in minutes) 87; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted April 11 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT With the outsize box office success of Paul Blart Mall Cop you can be excused for entering Observe and Report expecting sloppy seconds. In this version a pudgy Seth Rogen wears the tin badge of weaponless courage previously pinned on a pudgy Kevin James. But itll take only about three minutes before the unnerving truth sets in Observe and Report is as bleakly exhilaratingly ?furious as Paul Blart is squarely comforting. And from here on in its time to forget the Kevin James vehicle ?(no matter how similar some of the pairs superficial plot mechanics) and focus on the profound madness and ?sadness that fuels this risky riotous moody-blue comedy written and directed by Jody Hill. Shorn of his cute curls and ditching most traces of the shaggy sweetness that served him in Knocked Up and Monsters vs. Aliens Rogen plays Ronnie Barnhardt head of ?security at generic Forest Ridge Mall. Ronnie is a hard-ass stickler on the job and a lonely guy off duty -- with a million reasons why. Hes got bipolar disorder which keeps him from fulfilling his dream of becoming a real cop. (Theres none of Blarts benign hypoglycemia as an excuse for failure here.) He lives with his mother (Celia Weston) a pass-out-cold alcoholic as clammy as Blarts mom is fuzzy. Hes got a crush on a trampy makeup-counter clerk named Brandi (Anna Faris) who disdains him with all the obnoxiousness available to a drink-pounding tease flashing cleavage and lip gloss. But hes blind to the shy interest shown by a nice food-court barista (Collette Wolfe) regularly berated by her boss for laziness when really its only her broken leg thats slowing her down. (A metaphor for America? Why not.) Ronnies a man simmering to a boil -- Taxi Drivers Travis Bickle is a spiritual brother -- and his scalding spillover moment arrives when a flasher in a regulation flashers raincoat goes on a rampage traumatizing mall customers (which is bad enough) and then exposing his junk to Brandi (which to Ronnie is even worse). A hard-boiled detective ?(Ray Liotta) shows up to take charge of the investigation but Ronnie sees this criminal hunt as his mission. With everything to prove -- to Brandi to the cop academy that rejected him in the first place and to his own pharmaceutically ?managed sense of autonomy -- the competition to nab the perv is on. Director Hill previously demonstrated his unique comedic ability to screw with American normalcy in the great wack martial-arts movie The Foot Fist Way and co-created the warpy HBO series Eastbound amp; Down. To his credit he leads Observe and Report down every alley a mainstream comedy is supposed to avoid. The violence is bone-crunching. (Pineapple Express directed by David Gordon Green celebrated the same aesthetic of brutality and no wonder Hill and Green share an alumni brotherhood at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts as well as the amazing gimlet eye of cinematographer Tim Orr on both projects.) Women are depicted as skanks and slatterns. Ethnicity and sexual orientation are freely mocked. Unrepentant drinking and drugging go unchastised. The flasher flaps vigorously and often -- yes thats a penis I see before me -- leading to a chase scene through the mall that makes the naked wrestling set piece in ?Borat look coy. The result is a crazy mosaic of Americana with tiles scattered and missing. Need I observe and report that the view isnt for every taste? It sure is for mine. Meanwhile the cast led by Rogen chomps into all this anarchy as if liberated from the Hollywood salt mines with a commitment to the material worthy of a tribute from James Lipton. Faris adored these days for her specialty depiction of faux bimbos has no qualms making her Brandi a bitch rather than a more acceptably cartoonish beyotch. The superb character actor Celia Weston ?(In the Bedroom) is truly breathtaking as ?Ronnies boozer mom. The supporting cast including Hills regular muse and comedic ?co-conspirator Danny McBride and Hills game film-school pal Randy Gambill as the flasher never flinch from going exactly where youre bound to say Oh no they wouldnt. Oh yes they do. A?

Observe and Report Director Jody Hill. Cast Seth Rogen Ray Liotta Anna Faris. Rating Rated R for pervasive language graphic nudity drug use sexual content and violence. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Qamp;A Seth Rogen Spotlight Seth Rogen Until it is. Thats the shortcoming in ""Observe and Report"" written and directed by Hill and starring Seth Rogen. In his first film ""The Foot Fist Way"" about a disagreeable martial-arts instructor Hill struggled with wild shifts in tone. The same thing is true in ""Observe and Report"" in which Rogen plays a bipolar director of mall security (call him a mall cop at your peril) who becomes obsessed with apprehending a flasher. While its an intriguing break from the loveable schmuck Rogen has made a surprisingly successful career of playing allowing him to explore much darker territory Hill goes too far leaving Rogens character Ronnie Barnhardt with almost no redeeming characteristics. You dont root for the guy you fear him. Its a staple of comedies to send the character to a precipice and then pull him back at the last minute. Hill places Rogen there and then gives him a swift kick launching him beyond what were used to seeing in this kind of movie sometimes way beyond. Yet there are also numerous laugh-out-loud scenes all the funnier because they dont let small matters like taste and decency get in the way. The film is either a fearless stab at genius or an all-over-the-map mess. Ultimately its probably a little of both. Ronnie commands a sorry band of deputies his ""right-hand man"" Dennis (Michael Pena) and twins John and Matt (John and Matt Yuan) feeding his rather pronounced delusions of grandeur. Ronnies ""methods"" if you can even call them that continually thwart the efforts of Det. Harrison (Ray Liotta) yet Ronnie considers catching the flasher a noble quest one that will define him and land him the stuck-up Brandi (Anna Faris) as well. Brandi who works at the makeup counter in a department store looks upon Ronnie with disdain when she considers him at all. Only sweet Nell (Collette Wolfe) a sickly employee of Toast a Bun who is routinely derided by her boss treats Ronnie with anything approaching respect but hes blind to her charms. His home life is if anything worse. Ronnie lives in a trailer with his mother (Celia Weston) a spectacularly sodden drunk. Yet there is a bizarre sort of tenderness in the way he covers her when she passes out on the floor at night odd as that sounds. Of course on the other hand he just leaves her there. Its both to Hills credit and detriment that things dont play out as youd predict. Somewhere along the line Ronnie gets the idea he should join the police department. He faces several obstacles not the least of which are his psychiatric problems. Its here that things get really dark where Hill ventures into territory from which there is no return. Other characters too - Dennis in particular - undergo shifts that range from awkward to genuinely uncomfortable. And the R rating is well earned; an extended scene of full-frontal male nudity ensures that. Rogens performance is admirable; he certainly goes where Hill leads him and proves capable of being as creepy as he is funny. Weston is consistently hilarious as Ronnies mom but Wolfes Nell is the only character in the movie even close to sympathetic. Its an odd fascinating journey ""Observe and Report."" You have to respect Hills willingness to continually go to any length without so much as a flinch to get a laugh. But that doesnt mean youll continually enjoy it.

Hoberman Seth Rogen Wanders Another Shoppers Paradise in Observe and Report Wednesday April 8 2009 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Nice ride.Peter Sorel A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - As the title Observe and Report begs for analysis I herewith declare this Seth Rogen comedy broad but thin and more bleak than uproarious--a humorously downsized homage to foundational 70s classics like Dirty Harry and especially Taxi Driver cited by writer-director Jody Hill as a key influence.As the years second send-up of an emotionally unbalanced shopping mall security man it also takes us two-thirds of the way toward a trend. But where the eponymous loser-turned-winner protagonist of the wildly successful and equally slapdash Paul Blart Mall Cop (played by Kevin James) was a sweet and lovable hypoglycemic with dreams of joining the New Jersey state troopers and wooing the malls resident hair-extension specialist Ronnie Barnhardt is an angry self-important crude racist bipolar knucklehead possessed of similar ambitions but played by Rogen with admirable disregard for audience empathy.Adding to the pathology Ronnie (analysts will note the gender-ambiguous infantilizing name) lives at home with his slatternly sluttish dipso mother (Celia Weston) and haplessly lusts after her youthful counterpart the hard-partying cosmetics salesgirl Brandi (Anna Faris). Ronnies problems with sex and aggression are epitomized in an extended volley of alternately loud and sotto voce ""Fuck you""s exchanged with the mall worker he calls Saddam (Aziz Ansari). Longing for a real gun so as to be a real man this would-be authoritarian tough guy further engages in a destructively competitive relationship with the police detective Harrison (Ray Liotta) who arrives at the mall to investigate a case of male exhibitionism.Ronnie is obsessed with the flasher (unclothed and credited) as well he might be. This irrepressible exhibitionist exposes himself to Brandi (driving her to orgasmic hysteria) and is repressed Ronnies secret sharer. The two men have a certain physical similarity and Observe and Reports most relentless riff is the blatant equation of the flashers oft-seen and pointedly unprepossessing dick with the castrated mall cops attempt to possess what a Lacanian would call the phallic function. In the movies signature image Ronnie plasters a snapshot of the flashers member on his forehead and proclaims ""Thats me""Like its unpleasant protag Observe and Report isnt so much funny-ha-ha as funny-peculiar. Despite a couple of extended comic two-handers--Ronnies date with Brandi and his psychological evaluation when he applies for admission to the police academy--the movies most convulsive moments are the lunatic even terrifying explosions of invective and violence. Off his meds this alarmingly bellicose bratwurst confidently informs the professionally smiling psychologist that ""At this point in my life I feel like I could destroy some motherfuckers""Indeed. The requisite politically incorrect ethnic vaudeville (which involves Asians Arabs and Latinos but not African-Americans) is a needed cushion for the psychosexual drama. Viewers will be grateful that the singlemindedly simian Rogen who demonstrates more depth than range is flanked by two shameless clowns. The hilariously vulgar Faris (last seen in The House Bunny) injects some superbly timed physical comedy while Michael Pena (better known for serious roles in Lions for Lambs and World Trade Center) contributes a note of nihilistic bromance as Ronnies lisping sidekick. Rogens best bits are conceptual--as when Ronnie goes ""undercover"" (which is to say completely delusional) and recognized by his colleagues at the mall denies his utter existence.Ronnie ultimately devolves into a parody Travis Bickle whose rescue fantasy to the degree that it can be articulated centers on the handicapped abused ""born-again virgin"" (Collette Wolf) working the malls Dunkin Donuts equivalent. Still Observe and Report is not without a certain sociological verite. Ronnie the Mall Cop is as an iconic expression of irate proletarian populism and brainless role-playing as Joe the Plumber or Rush the Limbaugh--identify or ignore at your peril.

By David Edelstein Published Apr 5 2009 ShareThis (Photo Peter Sorel/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Behind the soullessly objective title Observe and Report comes a mighty volcano of psychosexual mayhema landmark crazy (as in pathological) comedy. Its set in a mall and centers on a cop but it is to Paul Blart Mall Cop as Taxi Driver is to Taxi. The writer-director Jody Hill goes straight for the action-comedy genres underbelly which turns out to be dark violent and jiggly. He opens with an overweight man rushing up to women in the parking lot spreading his raincoat and gleefully waggling the family jewels. A short time later another overweight man head of mall security Ronnie Barnhardt (Seth Rogen) proclaims Part of me thinks this disgusting pervert is the best thing that ever happened to me. Hes rightinsanely right. The fat creep has not only given Ronnies life a focushes virtually Ronnies doppelganger. On the hunt the blowhard gun nut Ronnie now has license to wave his own rod in peoples facesparticularly the face of Brandi (Anna Faris) the lissome blonde cosmetics clerk whose counter he haunts. Ronnie makes for an aggressively unattractive heroand some of us were already thinking Havent we seen enough of Seth Rogen for one lifetime? Yet director Hill piles on the unpleasantries as if determined to test our impulse to identify with the man carrying the gun (or here Taser). Ronnie lords it over the guys (racial minorities) in his security detail. He harasses a Muslim lotion vendor. He takes advantage of Brandis terror of the flasher to press her for a dateand give her a little squeeze. He relentlessly interferes with the ultra-professional detective (Ray Liotta) on the case. Its true that in comedies like Anchorman and Step Brothers Will Ferrell wins us over as fatuously self-centered child-men but Ferrell is ineradicably sweet. Rogens Ronnie is on a different plane of ickiness. Coming face-to-face with him in life we might actually fear for our safety. But Hill isnt simply raising the bar on grossness. His purview is wider. Macho mini-despotsand their originsinterest him. His first film The Foot Fist Way (2006) focused on a similar character Fred (Danny McBride) a martial-arts instructor given to bullying people who made him feel small (among them little kids). Only after this peewee fascist was thoroughly humiliatedby much bigger fascistsand had to overcome the urge to curl up in the fetal position for the rest of his pathetic life did we finally care about him He was a dick but he was suddenly our dick. The Foot Fist Way was monotonousit got stuck in a derisive-mockumentary groove. But somehow without our quite realizing it Hill made us see Fred not as a monster but a casualty of his culture. If you pricked him (or kicked him in the head) he would bleed. Observe and Reports Ronnie is a casualty tooof a broken family (his father is long gone his mother a prodigiously sloppy drunk) some bad genes (hes on strong psychoactive meds) a gun culture sexual frustration exacerbated by stacked blondes in short dresses and the accumulating spiritual effects of working in a mall and eating fast food. As Travis Bickle was a sponge for urban bad vibes Ronnie is modern suburban mall culture gone freakazoid. Hill hits what seems like a bad-taste peak early on (Ronnie grinding away on top of an ostensibly unconscious alcohol-and-drug-addled vomit-flecked Brandi) and just keeps climbing. When Ronnie and his second-in-command Dennis (Michael Pena) embark on an orgy of drug-taking and authoritarian violence against unarmed civilians the air in the theater feels dangerously thin. Is this a comedy again? Most certainlythanks to among other things an ensemble of comic geniuses. Ray Liotta uses the tension between his ravaged teenage-delinquent complexion and girlishly soft eyesall at once they twinkle with sadismto make you laugh before he opens his mouth. Anna Faris expels her Valley Girl lines as if hysterically entranced by her own blondeness; her hyperventilations are exquisite. Celia Weston plays Ronnies mothers alcoholism not to the hilt but the hilt above the hilt. I wont spoil the joke in Penas lisping baby-sweet security guard but Ill say its in the tailand it stings. And damn if Rogen isnt wonderful too. He never sugars Ronnies dementia. As the blind fool skulks around the mall egregious in his undercover attire (I live by a code of my own invention he narrates. In these dark times the world has no use for another scared man) you see that he believes in his own omniscience. Observe and Report is the rare action-comedy (almost always a muddled hybrid) that earns its cathartic climax. The blood is real because the psychosis is real. But somehowthe magic of comedyits also uproarious. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Think ""Travis Bickle Mall Cop"" and youll have some idea of what to expect from ""Observe and Report"" writer-director Jody Hills shockingly and sometimes discomfortingly funny comedy about an unstable security guard who views himself as vigilant protector - and occasionally avenging angel - while patrolling a suburban shopping mall. Taking a setup that could have been played for sitcom jokiness and family-friendly slapstick Hill attempts something much darker if not downright transgressive with a pic bound to divide auds and critics into love-it-or-leave-it camps when it opens April 10. Its a gamble that might pay off handsomely for Warners. Or not. With his hair cropped short his waistline expanded and his overall vibe suggesting less lovable schlub than fascistic thug Seth Rogen makes no effort to claim aud sympathy with a nervy lead performance thats in perfect sync with the pic itself. Rogen keeps the aud off-balance in ways that arent always pleasurable often indicating that at any moment funny business might devolve into serious mayhem - which on at least three occasions it does. Rogen plays Ronnie Barnhardt security chief at Forest Ridge Mall a terse tough-talking fellow who still lives at home with his alcoholic mom (Celia Weston) nurses a crush on a bosomy makeup-counter salesclerk (Anna Faris) and commands the other guards on his watch with the intensity of a Marine sergeant in a war zone. When the mall is repeatedly stalked by a flasher Ronnie views the perv as an affront to all that is decent and wholesome in Forest Ridge Mall. He also welcomes the hunt for this unwelcome visitor as a way of proving his potential to become a real police officer. Trouble is someone whos already a real police officer the cynical and unsympathetic Det. Harrison (Ray Liotta) is called in by mall management to handle the situation. For Ronnie Harrison is an interloper in his jurisdiction. For Harrison Ronnie is a klutzy rent-a-cop to be humored then heckled. Despite all the gleeful vulgarity and non-PC humor of the opening scenes and despite all the clear signs that Ronnie has a ludicrously exaggerated (and entirely unjustified) sense of self-worth its not until around the 20-minute mark that writer-director Hill reveals just how unconventional he intends ""Observe and Report"" to be. As a prank Harrison drops Ronnie off in a rough neighborhood to give the security guard a taste of ""real cop"" life. What follows is a sequence that is all the more hilarious because the violence is so seriously brutal. Much like the cruel and clueless martial-arts instructor in Hills breakthrough debut feature ""The Foot Fist Way"" Ronnie is more complex and much scarier than the kind of self-deluding boob auds usually encounter in comedies of this sort. With the invaluable aid of Rogen whos never been better Hill sustains an impressive degree of tension between seemingly contradictory elements. In fact time and again throughout ""Observe and Report"" it may strike some viewers that with just a few tweaks of the script the scenario could have been played straight as a psychological drama in the vein of ""Taxi Driver"" (even though the ending plays more like ""The King of Comedy""). At the same time Hill earns big laughs with comic setpieces that are guaranteed to generate strong word of mouth. Highlights range from explosively funny gross-out gags - Faris is a great sport during the most amusing of these - to scenes of comic violence that elicit winces as well as laughs. Supporting perfs are nicely disciplined across the board so Faris and Weston are effectively uninhibited without seeming grotesque and Liotta never betrays his characters intimidating toughness with a wink or a nod. Other standouts include Colette Wolfe as a Toast-a-Bun barista who warms to Ronnie and John and Matthew Yuan as twin brothers who toil as Ronnies most loyal underlings. Michael Pena is also memorable as the security chiefs loyal assistant. Filmed on location in the largely abandoned Winrock Mall in Albuquerque N.M. ""Observe and Report"" boasts production values that are unobtrusively sufficient. Pic makes inspired use of a semi-obscure oldie on the soundtrack the Yardbirds ""Over Under Sideways Down"" during a sequence that will make viewers guffaw until theyre thoroughly ashamed of themselves.
