A Waste of Anna Faris Movies | By    Jordan Riefe on September 29 2011  1016 am Follow aduralde Email Print Flat rom-com is just another chick flick with nothing but contempt for women Anna Faris has been called this generations Lucille Ball Shes pretty smart has impeccable timing and isnt afraid to cast dignity aside in pursuit of a hardy laugh. Her new film ""Whats Your Number?"" is a pet project she both stars in and produced. Its a chance to show just how audacious she can be a chance to step up a chance to shine. And it stinks on ice. Faris plays Ally an average 20-something living on her own in Boston. Riding home on the subway after losing her job she reads in a magazine that the average woman has had ten lovers in her lifetime and if you reach 20 you will probably never find true love. Acting on this hair-brained tidbit she counts up all her past lovers only to find shes reached 19 one shy of eternal spinsterhood. Seeking to avoid the dreaded 20th she tracks down her exes in the hope that one of them will be marriage material. She enlists the help of playboy neighbor Colin (Chris Evans) whose family of cops somehow qualifies him to track down exes. Allys travels take her to Miami for a pap smear to meet an old lover (Thomas Lennon) who is now a gynecologist; to Washington D.C. to track an old boyfriend (Anthony Mackie) from her college days when she campaigned for George W. Bush (yes Ally may well be the first Republican rom-com protagonist); and stalks a formerly-fat ex in Beacon Hill (real-life husband Chris Pratt) who has slimmed down enough to marry a superhot architect. In other words Ally is pathetic. Spurred into action by questionable notions of how many lovers are appropriate she is unemployed but somehow manages to jet around to meet men she barely knows so she wont miss out on her chance at true happiness. This isnt a woman who needs to fall in love; this is a woman who needs counseling. In classic screwball comedies women were smart and independent beings who had room in their life for romance without making it the overriding priority. But in 21st century movies like ""Whats Your Number?"" a woman isnt complete until she has a man happily putting her life on hold and making an ass of herself to find Mr. Right. Comparing Faris to Lucille Ball might be a touch premature if only because the 35-year-old Faris hasnt yet achieved a comparable body of work. She distinguished herself among lame jokes in the physically punishing ""Scary Movie"" series and blithely carried ""House Bunny"" her last starring vehicle in 2008. But since then she has been mired in an industry clearly bemused by funny ladies taking bland supporting roles in movies like ""Take Me Home Tonight"" and ""Yogi Bear."" But Faris has earned her accolades which is why ""Whats Your Number?"" feels particularly disappointing. Not that its all her fault -- the screenplay by Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden is virtually laugh-free with both jokes and plot points telecast well beforehand. (Youll guess the ending in the first three minutes.) Chris Evans works well with a thinly drawn character but everyone struggles under director Mark Mylods uninspired hand. A veteran of shows like ""Entourage"" Mylod doesnt have much big-screen experience outside of Sacha Baron Cohens pre-""Borat"" feature ""Ali G Indahouse."" In his first studio movie Mylod couldnt play it any safer employing strictly conventional shot selection and editing to cover the action while demonstrating an uneven hand with his talented cast leaving Faris struggling abandoned and rudderless as she reels off joke after deadening joke. Conventional in the worst possible way ""Whats Your Number?"" is anti-woman antediluvian and worst of all about as funny as a public hanging. If youre a Faris fan and you want to stay one do yourself (and her) a favor and stay home. Breaking News To Your Inbox. Sign up >> http//twitter.com/share?text=Review Witless Whats Your Number?

R. 1 hour 46 minutes. At area theaters. In ""Whats Your Number"" Ally Darlings bleak day turns dire when she learns that she is high above the median for women when it comes to number of sexual partners. Worse Her score on that meter is about to hit 20. According to a magazine article that tragic-more-than-magic number is the cutoff between marriageable females and left-behind tarts. This desperately seeking-laughs comedy stars Anna Faris a comedian with a lot of quirk appeal though little of it is on display. At the start of summer the movie was positioned to be Faris comedic breakout. Its not. Comedy isnt easy but Faris tries too hard. When Mr. 20 turns out not to be Mr. Right Ally resorts to creative accounting seeking out her old boyfriends in hopes of discovering that one of them was ""the one."" Chris Evans (a.k.a. Captain America) cuts a relaxed and fine figure as Allys semi-cad of a neighbor Colin. He agrees to help Ally track down her exes if shell let him hide out while each nights conquest gets his gentle hint. A nudge is hardly required to see where Ally and Colin are headed. ""Whats Your Number"" resembles an aging radio that cant pick up a true signal. You spin the dial up and down down and up. Theres girlfriend banter between Faris her soon-to-be wed sis Daisy (Ari Graynor) and a gaggle of bridesmaids that sounds like HBOs ""Sex and the City"" only its never snappy. There are tunes that recall 80s flicks. Is that New Orders ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" really? The static never sharpens. Penned by Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden from Karyn Bosnaks ""20 Times a Lady"" this R-rated comedy is all very high-concept in a stoop-to-conquer way. Which is why the best news about this girls-gone-raunchy comedy might be that ""Bridemaids"" came out on DVD last week. So you can get your naughty deeper laughs elsewhere.

(Claire Folger) D- Whats Your Number? Genre Comedy; Starring Chris Evans Anna Faris; Release Date Wide 09/30/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 106; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Posted October 2 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT When it comes to playing women who are smart even when they act dumb and adorable even when they act skanky Anna Faris has the market cornered. Fans of The House Bunny (like me) know that her funny postfeminist single-girl sexpot avatar -- a woman of integrity who can be mistaken at first glance for a slut -- is a thing of beauty. Faris does what she traditionally does best in the vulgar sex comedy Whats Your Number? But the movie counts too much on the star to save the day single-handedly with her cleavage platinum hair and vagina talk. Lots of vagina talk. And she cant not with a production as witless as this one. Faris plays Ally Darling self-described as ""a jobless whore whos slept with 20 guys."" The bedroom count is fact and Ally is indeed without employment having been let go from her nonspecific marketing job by a boss (Joel McHale from Community) who then proceeds to hit on her while shes drunk. But ""whore"" is strictly a judgment passed by screenwriters Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden (working from a book by Karyn Bosnak) even if its couched as a joke. ""Whore"" is the kind of descriptor the creators of Whats Your Number? think is hilarious for a woman to apply to herself one whose only ""scandal"" involves a head count of her sex partners. And by the way who in this day and age is counting? Allys big mistake is reading an article in a womens magazine that calculates dire husband-hunting odds for any woman whos had more than 20 lovers. So with unemployed time on her hands she works backwards tracking down old bedmates to see if she should have recognized the husband material in any of them. (Andy Samberg and Faris real-life husband Chris Pratt from Parks and Recreation show up among her exes.) For contrast Allys younger sister (Ari Graynor with nothing whatever to do) plans her very perfect wedding while Mama Darling (Blythe Danner) frets about her unmarried older daughter who doesnt style her hair or wardrobe to Mamas liking. Of course the right guy is nearby Hes Colin (Chris Evans) the new across-the-hall neighbor whom Ally enlists to help her do her Google- and Facebook-assisted research. Colin by the way doesnt call himself a man-whore although he brings home a new woman every night. Anyhow Ally and Colin theyre kindred earthy spirits who enjoy sex and sloppy food. But since they arent allowed to recognize their feelings for one another until the end of the movie Whats Your Number? fills the waiting time with a level of chick-style raunchiness that only enhances Bridesmaids reputation as the current paragon of a top-quality universally appealing female-driven comedy. Conversation among female friends and family in this part of the femme-com universe relies on talk of pap smears blow jobs hand jobs penises ""69"" and those aforementioned vaginas discussed with a stupidity that would bore Kenny and Cartman over on South Park. For what its worth Whats Your Number? at least shows consistency Under the direction of Entourages Mark Mylod the movie not only makes cheap sex jokes but looks skanky too. Lighting camerawork and editing are all a slapdash mess one that further hinders the actors trying their best to get through this failed hookup of a comedy.

Colin (Chris Evans) the fuck-machine bachelor who lives across the hall knows how to use Facebook so he aids Allys chase. Cue bicker-flirting over beer and pizza strip basketball and a perfectly chaste sleepover--a utopia wrecked when Ally attempts to appease her judgey mom and soon-to-be-married sis by reuniting with her moneybags high school sweetheart. Pushed back from an April release date Whats Your Number unavoidably plays like a mash-up of the recent romantic comedies that it should have beat to market. Like Bridesmaids its a raunchy romp about a smart pretty girl with a secret creative talent playing second banana in the lead up to a loved ones wedding; like Friends With Benefits its a self-congratulatory self-aware riff on best friends making the best mates. Unfortunate coincidences of timing maybe but what about the shameless retreading of late-20th-century cool-kids rom-coms (High Fidelity Reality Bites)? Still even if the speechifying is cringingly trite and even though its evident from Colins first frame onscreen that 21 will be Allys lucky number at least her roundelay through exes allows for a few scant moments of inspired lunacy led by Fariss cartoon-perfect vocal talents.

The new Anna Faris comedy drastically misuses her and insults women. By Dana Stevens Whats Your Number? Courtesy 20th Century Fox. All rights reserved. After youve seen Whats Your Number? check out our Spoiler Special discussion Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Advertisement If Whats Your Number? (Twentieth Century Fox) a new romantic comedy starring Anna Faris and Chris Evans and directed by Mike Mylod contains even a grain of truth about contemporary gender politics then being a young woman in 2011 must be a frightening and confusing experience indeed. That Whats Your Number? is a bad movie is the least of the reasons to walk out of it feeling awful. Competing for the top spot are these two the criminal misuse of Faris a diminutive round-eyed blonde whos one of the most talented comic actresses now working; and the casual endorsement of courtship practices as arcane and sadistic as Chinese foot-binding. Of course it could be argued that Whats Your Number? doesnt really endorse the belief system that its heroine Ally Darling (Faris) reads about in a womens magazine and immediately takes to heart that women become steadily less desirable with each new sexual encounter while men are free to rack up Situation-esque numbers with no harm done. There are a couple of characters including Allys hunky neighbor and obvious future soulmate Colin (the appealing if miscast Evans) who dismiss this kind of notch-counting as antiquated. But ultimately both Colin and the audience become complicit in the prescriptive fiction that having sex acts as an erosive force on the female character. Over the course of the film Ally moves--sort of--from denying to embracing her identity as a slut but the category of ""slut"" itself is never called into question. According to the article Ally reads once a woman has had in excess of 20 sexual partners her chances of getting married drop precipitously. Making a quick headcount Ally realizes with horror that shes already at 19 and that the next guy she sleeps with had better be ""the one."" Allys haste to pair off is increased by the fact that her perfect younger sister Daisy (Ari Graynor looking more like Angie Dickinson than ever) is about to marry her high-school sweetheart. So Ally decides to go through her list of exes and look them up one by one reasoning that if she can find true love with someone shes already been defiled by she wont have to increase her count. With Colins help Ally begins methodically tracking down her past lovers allowing for a parade of cameos that include Andy Samberg as a pimpled teenage puppeteer Chris Pratt (Faris real-life husband) as a former fat guy whos now become both slim and engaged and Anthony Mackie as a closeted gay politician who wants Ally to serve as his beard. (Mackies furtive confession is one of the many moments when Eisenhower-era sexual mores mysteriously bob to the surface of this raunchy comedy.) Ally begins to despair of ever finding ""the one""--until the night her and Colins platonic date turns into a one-on-one game of strip basketball. Will she throw caution to the wind and make the fateful leap into sex den No. 20? Advertisement If the lead was played by your average rom-com placeholder girl sashaying ditzily through these plot machinations I might just throw up my hands and write off Whats Your Number? on the grounds that a dumb movie and a dumb actress deserve each other. But the presence of Faris renders the proceedings not just annoying but actively depressing. This 34-year-old actress is so gifted so funny so game that even this material cant keep her from getting the odd laugh. In the movies best scene Ally runs into a British ex-boyfriend (Martin Freeman of the original Office). Her face twisted in panic she launches into a posh Oxbridge accent and we realize that during their entire relationship she must have passed herself off as a Brit. The two head off for a pint at the pub and the more Ally drinks the further her accent devolves--first to Eliza Doolittle and finally to Borat. Its a scene that lets Faris showcase some of her skill sets vocal impressions self-mocking goofiness and above all audacity the ability to push a joke past its initial beat to a different crazier place. More than any contemporary comedienne I can think of (with the possible exception of Kristen Wiig who mines a different drier vein) Faris demonstrates this fearless anything-for-a-laugh quality. It would be wonderful to see her in a movie that tested the limits of that audacity rather than forcing her to tamp it down. Ive already raved about Faris performance in the otherwise unremarkable The House Bunny and in a short guest arc on the despicable Entourage. To see her in a role that does deserve her watch Gregg Arakis Smiley Face a feminist stoner odyssey that seems to get funnier and more radical with each viewing. Yes Faris generally plays the role of a well-intentioned spaz but she wouldnt be the first comic to have established a career creating variants on one persona. For comedy connoisseurs it isnt news that Anna Faris is a largely untapped treasure. The melancholy question that lingers on the way out of the vulgar yet retrograde Whats Your Number? is Whither Anna? Tad Friends profile of Faris in The New Yorker earlier this year was both an exploration of the actress originality and a portrait of the Hollywood forces conspiring to stifle it. This movie which Faris co-executive-produced is a grim byproduct of precisely that tension. Its dispiritingly easy to imagine Faris trapped by the paucity of female roles available to her like the heroine of an Edith Wharton novel. At the end of Whats Your Number? her character Ally manages to find happiness despite her double-digit roster of lovers. But Anna Faris cant let herself be besmirched by 19 more comedies like this one. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

Anna Faris in a scene from ""Whats Your Number?"" Film review Whats Your Number? Another stalled vehicle for Anna Faris Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 30 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Anna Faris is the almost-It Girl a wide-eyed clown in the mode of Goldie Hawn or Judy Holiday superficially ditzy but with genuine wit and sex appeal. Almost everyone who talks or writes about her seems to like her and thinks she deserves a higher profile than the crummy roles shes played in such bottom-feeder comedies as Scary Movie The House Bunny and The Hot Chick. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new romantic comedy ""Whats Your Number?"" starring Anna Faris Movies Whats Your Number The official trailer Whats Your Number? in which Faris stars and serves as executive producer has been touted as a potential breakout film that does justice to her comic skills. In the movie directed by Mark Mylod ( Shameless Entourage) Faris plays Ally Darling a woman in her early 30s who reads an article in Marie Claire magazine that says women who have slept with more than 20 men are likely to stay single. Since she has almost hit that magic number Ally decides to review her past lovers to see if she can rediscover Mr. Right. Last April The New Yorker offered a profile of Faris in the context of the prejudices and hurdles against making an R-Rated comedy with a female lead. The article written before the raunchy Bridesmaids became a hit presents an usually bald version of Hollywood cynicism with studios seeking the comedy kill-zone between titillation and offence. As it happens apart from the use of relatively clinical words like ""douche"" ""vagina"" and ""penis"" Whats Your Number? is only disturbing in its painful predictability. Based on Karyn Bosnaks novel Twenty Times a Lady the script by TV writers Jennifer Crittenden and Gabrielle Allan fits the rom-com formula portraying Ally as a sweet and vulnerable mess. Ditched by her boyfriend and fired from her job in the opening reel she gets bombed at her sisters bridal shower gets bombed again and ends up accidentally adding to her lifetime sex score. Convinced that her problem is promiscuity and not the more obvious alcoholism she begins to retrace her romantic steps to find out which former boyfriend might be marriage material. First though the film short circuits its own premise by introducing her across-the-hall neighbour Colin (Captain Americas Chris Evans). Hes a cocky womanizing musician with hot abs and a convenient talent for sleuthing learned from his detective dad. In exchange for letting him use Allys apartment to hide out from his nightly hook-ups hell help her track down her exes. Her past boyfriends (Chris Pratt Martin Freeman Andy Samberg Anthony Mackie Zachary Quinto Joel McHale) are each worth about one snicker. When that storyline runs out of steam the second act pairs her with a dull tycoon (Dave Annable) who pleases Allys blueblood mother (a shrill Blythe Danner) and puts Ally on par with her younger sister (Ari Graynor) whose wedding is imminent. Ed Begley Jr. appears briefly as the free-spirited dad. But the supporting cast seems less a part of a story than the movies built-in audience for repeated scenes in which Faris character takes the spotlight does something embarrassing compounds it with something more embarrassing and blusters irrepressibly through it all. Shes funny yes but is this an achievement or a rut? Once again Anna Faris manages to be the best thing in another not very good Anna Faris movie. Whats Your Number?

Sarah Palin is the subject of a critical portrait by the acerbic documentarian Nick Broomfield known for his gonzo portraits of the famous and the controversial. Steven Senne/AP hide caption toggle caption Steven Senne/AP Sarah Palin You Betcha Director Nick Broomfield Joan Churchill Genre Documentary Running Time 91 minutes Not Rated With Sarah Palin Nick Broomfield John McCain and Bill OReilly (Recommended) Watch Clips From Sarah Palin You Betcha - She Wasnt Listening She Wasnt Listening Credit Freestyle Releasing If youd never heard of Sarah Palin before you saw Nick Broomfields documentary about her heres what youd learn That the former candidate for the vice presidency is a real looker from almost any camera angle. That shes charming gracious and a big flirt at book-signings but impossible to pin down for an interview. That she knows how to work a room of like-minded evangelicals and that she has many adoring fans in the Tea Party because she speaks for them and makes each one feel that ""theyre the only person on Earth."" That in almost every other respect pertaining to Wasilla Alaska the Republican Party and the future of American democracy she is -- according to an assembly of former employees colleagues and rivals -- a waking nightmare. In other words not much thats new. Never one to take a back seat in his movies Broomfield projects a shambling Columbo-style bonhomie that gains him access to people who should be very afraid of letting him cross their threshold. Slipping and sliding his way around Palins icebound hometown of Wasilla -- population 6000; 76 churches; crystal meth capital of Alaska -- in plaid jacket and flapped hat a sound boom clutched in hand the British director charms his way into the modest home where Palin grew up. There her genial father Chuck Heath proves a stalwart Palin booster while conceding that even as a child she never lacked for competitive drive. Heath Sr. might have been less forthcoming had he looked into Broomfield a laid-back Brit of the Michael Moore school of nonfiction filmmaking. Broomfield who co-directed with longtime associate Joan Churchill is an up-front if highly idiosyncratic liberal known for sympathetic profiles of powerfully transgressive women -- serial killer Aileen Wuornos Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss drugged-out rocker Courtney Love. i Broomfield who moved to Palins hometown of Wasilla AK while making the film was ultimately unable to secure an interview with the former Republican vice-presidential candidate -- so he appears with a cardboard stand-up of her in his documentary. Freestyle Releasing hide caption toggle caption Freestyle Releasing Broomfield who moved to Palins hometown of Wasilla AK while making the film was ultimately unable to secure an interview with the former Republican vice-presidential candidate -- so he appears with a cardboard stand-up of her in his documentary. Freestyle Releasing In short Broomfield is a cheerfully kinky guy. But as it turns out theres very little personal dirt in Sarah Palin You Betcha that wouldnt be upstaged by Joe McGinniss recent Palin tell-all unless you count some potentially unreliable testimony about her parental shortcomings from her former brother-in-law a state trooper she tried to have fired during her short stint as governor of Alaska. If anything Broomfield is amused by the smut machine that surrounds most public figures today In a moment of pure black comedy we hear him telling an agent for Palins former son-in-law Levi Johnston that he cant afford the 20000 that is apparently Johnstons going rate for the inside scoop on the Palin familys sexual proclivities. Its not that Broomfield disapproves of dish or has no sympathy for marginal behavior -- his oeuvre offers proof that hes drawn to the absurd and the seamy. But one gets the sense that he is genuinely appalled by Palins political shortcomings the seeming gap between her religious beliefs and her own behavior her failures as mayor of Wasilla and governor of Alaska as well as what comes across as her preternaturally vengeful nature. After traveling to Egypt to chat up the lone former classmate who was willing to talk about her on camera (the word is not good) Broomfield rounds up a posse of operatives who worked for her plus a few intrepid types who dared to oppose her openly. To a man (and woman) they offer appreciations of her personal magnetism before launching into bitter accounts of how thoroughly she shafted them for real or imagined slights. The Sarah Palin that emerges from this collective testimony is consistently thin-skinned mean paranoid divisive lazy and far more obsessed with settling scores than with the daily grind of governance. More than one former ally fears that Palin would be trigger-happy with the nuclear button were she to gain the Oval Office. For his part Broomfield worries more about what he sees as her ignorance her inability to tolerate dissent and her unwillingness to engage in public debate. To him that -- combined with her enormous skill at whipping up a like-minded crowd -- speaks volumes not just about Palin but about the cynical political culture that invited her to draw close to the White House then kicked her to the curb when she got out of hand. If or when Palin finally decides to run for president Broomfield suggests American democracy itself will be at stake.

Laremy Legel 09/30/2011 Youve seen Whats Your Number? before. Sure its rated R and yes it has two strong young leads but its basically every romantic comedy culled together over the past three decades. There will be no variation from exactly what you expect and so enjoyment must be attained from the particulars of the journey. Which it does at times thanks to the uber-likable Chris Evans and Anna Faris. Ally Darling (Anna Faris) is an admittedly wacky girl. Just the sort you build a romantic comedy around Her sister is about to get married and you can tell Ally marches to the beat of a different drummer because her engagement party toast is a little off. She drinks a little too much she sculpts odd little demons in her free time and shes recently become worried about her sexual proclivities. When she reads in a magazine that the average lady person has 10 ""relationships"" before marriage and realizes shes sitting pretty at 20 she becomes concerned. Is she doomed to an existence of casual dalliances? A life change is needed What would you do in this particular situation? Therapy? Reactivate that gym membership? Join your local rotary club? Drink yourself into a stupor? Now pretend youre in a romantic comedy. Ah its all different now isnt it? All of a sudden you want to systematically find all of your exes to figure out if one of them was ""the one"" dont you? I see that look in your eyes you minxy little rom-com. Twenty exes it is. Cue up the expository pop music. The search for exes is precisely where Chris Evans comes in. Hes the next-door neighbor who just so happens to be handy with research. He offers to trade his investigative services in exchange for Allys help in getting rid of the oodles of models he sleeps with who want to ""talk"" with him the morning after the hook-up. And who hasnt been there? This of course is a completely ludicrous setup because none of this has ever happened to anyone anywhere ever throughout the history of the universe. At no point did any living being ever say ""I will now find my 20 previous mates."" A little light Facebook stalking sure no problem -- but all 20 exes? Furthermore at no point did a male of a species sleep with a model of the same species and not know how to talk with her for a few minutes once the sun came up. The very skills one would need to date models would be those same skills that would prove handy in the morning charm levity and the ability to manage tricky situations. It reminds me of that scene from Airplane Rex Kramer Do you know what its like to fall in the mud and get kicked in the head with an iron boot? Of course you dont no one does. It never happens. Sorry Ted thats a dumb question ... skip that. Still the show must go on and chuckles must be had and in fairness Whats Your Number? has at least a dozen of those. Anna Faris is absolutely heroic in her comedic method; shes willing to head straight for site gags take on massive embarrassment and generally look the fool on a level most leading ladies wouldnt deign to show us. In this manner she truly is the funniest actor in the business because shes the most human the most authentic and she needs it the most. You can tell Faris craves laughs and so its incredibly easy to root for her and by extension her character. And so while Whats Your Number? isnt innovative dynamic or anything other than completely predictable it does provide a few laughs. Which is sort of the point. No its not Bridemaids or The Other Guys or any of the other massively funny comedies weve seen over the past few years but its not all bad either.

(Claire Folger/AP) Joe Neumaier Friday September 30 2011 400 AM Title Whats Your Number? With Anna Faris Chris Evans. A woman decides she missed a gem among one of her past 20 boyfriends. Director Mark Mylod (146). R Language sexuality. At area theaters.In ""Whats Your Number?"" Anna Faris plays a luckless woman who announces ""Im not gonna sleep with one more guy till Im sure hes the one""Faris almost always a funnier presence than her terrible movies deserve ought to make the same promise about the scripts she chooses.In this mostly laugh-free charmless rom-com that occasionally glides by with the help of its affable leads Faris plays the ridiculously named Ally Darling a goofy Boston singleton. Ally reads a ""scientific study"" in a womans mag that says her lifetime partners should end up at no more than 10. Allys are twice that and since she has just lost her job and her sister is preparing for a wedding she obsesses about her marriage prospects. To keep her number from going up she seeks out all the guys shes loved before to hopefully rekindle a flame.With the help of her frequently naked overgrown-kid neighbor Colin (Chris Evans) -- an ""expert in finding people"" -- Ally reconnects with Mr. Brit (Martin Freeman) Mr. Magic (Andy Samberg) and Mr. Secretly Gay Politician (Anthony Mackie). Her gross ex-boss (Joel McHale) who clocked in at No. 20 is the tipping point.Suffice to say that Colin a career cad always hiding out with Ally till his gorgeous conquests leave his place is Allys soulmate. Theres also a gaggle of squawky pals who offer dating dos-and-donts straight from a ""SATC"" episode. And Allys divorced folks (Blythe Danner Ed Begley Jr.) think shes a loose cannon who should grow up.Well that parts true but the real problem with ""Whats Your Number?"" is twofold. One it seems eager to out-""Bridesmaids"" the competition by using oh-so-outre scatological language that merely comes off as juvenile. Two it layers onto that would-be naughtiness a scolding attitude toward sex and a race-to-the-altar conclusion that make it as traditional as a zombifi ed Jane Austen. Its of two minds you could say.Evans still in good ""Captain America"" shape tries to be cocky and engaging. And Faris who needs a ""Born Yesterday"" of her own gives a Cockney accent a spin in one scene and goes for broke with some pratfalls. Its all in the service of a movie that if it gets lucky will be the second bill on a future brides ""wild night"" with the gals. But caveat emptor This comedy is empty.Magic Moment Meeting an old BF from Blighty Ally speaks with an accent -- because he thinks shes English.

You cant teach an old-boyfriends movie new tricks.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune October 3 2011 -- 1006am Claire Folger 20th Century Fox Anna Faris has a coiffure malfunction as she revisits tossed-aside boyfriends. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Stop me if youve heard this one before. Girl late 20s checkered romantic background requires boyfriend/date for sisters wedding. Been there done that enough? Then you may as well skip ""Whats Your Number?"" Its not abysmal. Ive seen slight variations on this movie approximately 4000 times and Ive seen it done worse. But anyone who would praise its middling virtues -- pleasant cast photogenic Boston locations perky Anna Faris -- would do a backflip after finding an extra pickle in her Whopper. Theres just zilch here to get excited about. It does nothing you havent seen before. For fans of conventionality and predictability here goes Faris plays Ally a woman thrown into existential crisis by her younger sisters nuptials. Ally has racked up an impressive number of paramours but none of those square pegs fit. A womens magazine article on marriage statistics declares that if she has one more boyfriend she will be a certified hosebag. Therefore she must reconnect with all her old boyfriends to see if she missed Mr. Right and land her catch in time to attend sis wedding. Well yawn. Though her prospects are played by Chris Pratt Aziz Ansari Thomas Lennon Martin Freeman Zachary Quinto Andy Samberg and Anthony Mackie the mirth is restrained. Her bad-boy neighbor agrees to help her with the sleuthing and since the character is played by Chris Evans there is a strong possibility that theyll both be swept away by a destiny they cannot control and end up together. Ya think? Faris who is adept at broad physical comedy overwhelms her role. Kristin Wiig went through many of the same contortions in ""Bridesmaids"" and did a better job. Television director Mark Mylod adds none of the flair needed to redeem the recycled cliche-riddled script. This films ambitions are modest and it still disappoints. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

""You seem like the type of girl who tries to make a bad thing work"" Chris Evans says to Anna Faris in ""Whats Your Number?"" This is certainly true of Faris character whos looking for love within a pool of ex-boyfriends. But it also applies to the actress herself. No matter how charmingly loopy she is Faris cant transcend the stale gender cliches and rehashed rom-com set pieces that keep this movie from being what director Mark Mylod apparently wants it to be -- the new ""Bridesmaids -- right down to the identical opening gag. ""Whats Your Number?"" breaks no new ground as Ally Darling (Faris) a 20-something Bostonian frets about not yet having found ""the one"" while helping her sister (Ari Graynor) plan a lavish wedding. When Ally reads a Marie Claire article about the significance of the number of a womans sexual partners -- more than 20 dooms you to certain spinsterhood -- she asks around and discovers her number (19) is higher than most of her friends. Chastened she vows to make it work with one of the men shes already bedded. She enlists the aid of her neighbor Colin (Chris Evans) who keeps sneaking into Allys apartment in various states of undress to escape morning-after chitchat with his own conquests. She makes a deal Shell let him hide out if hell help track down all her exes. This sets up a series of interludes with some very likable actors. Chris Pratt Faris real-life husband plays a newly svelte ex-boyfriend. British actor Martin Freeman (""Sherlock"") witnesses the slow drunken deterioration of Allys fake accent. Andy Samberg of ""SNL"" in flashback is the geeky puppeteer who deflowered her. Tom Lennon is a gynecologist who remembers her only when she scootches down to the end of the examining table. Anthony Mackies aspiring politician thanks Ally for helping him realize hes gay. Each seems to have the same reaction I did Whats the point of all this? Meanwhile Colin -- adorable enough to make it glaringly obvious hes Mr. Right -- is the voice of reason. ""What kind of guy cares about how many people you slept with anyway?"" he says. Its a fair point especially coming from someone whose number looks to be in the triple digits but the double standard never merits any serious consideration. When not teaching facile lessons about being true to yourself ""Whats Your Number?"" does offer a handful of genuinely funny one-liners about sex. Unfortunately it undermines them by dropping the word ""vagina"" enough times to make Sarah Silverman blush. But then as Evans sage horndog might point out its not the number of vaginas that matters. Its what you do with them that counts.

Starring Anna Faris Chris Evans Zachary Quinto Andy Samberg Ari Graynor Martin Freeman Matt Bomer Chris Pratt Ivana Milicevic Joel McHale Director Mark Mylod Running time 146 Release Opened Sep 30 2011  Editorial Review Bridesmaids revisited sort ofBy Michael OSullivanFriday Sep 30 2011The ads for ""Whats Your Number?"" have made no secret of what theyre gunning for. The chick-centric raunch fest is according to the commercial ""20 times funnier"" than ""Bridesmaids"" this summers breakout R-rated comedy starring Kristen Wiig as the lusty lovelorn best pal of bride-to-be Maya Rudolph. The new movie - starring Anna Faris as the lusty lovelorn sister of bride-to-be Ari Graynor - even opens with the same joke that ""Bridesmaids"" opened with Fariss Ally Darling hopping out of bed at the crack of dawn just so she can primp in front of the mirror before her sleeping boyfriend Rick (Zachary Quinto) sees what she really looks like in the morning. It was funny in ""Bridesmaids."" Now much like Ally herself it just comes across as desperate. In a bid to attract the ""Bridesmaids"" audience - guys who wouldnt normally be caught dead at a chick flick and gals who wouldnt normally be caught dead at a foul-mouthed sex farce - ""Whats Your Number?"" ups the vulgarity ladling it on top of a rom-com base so insipid and predictable that the only thing to keep you awake is counting the number of times that the script drops the word ""vagina."" Its a lot. But as noted by the New York Times nearly every new female-powered TV sitcom this year - ""Whitney"" ""Suburgatory"" ""Two Broke Girls"" - is also wearing out that word. This makes ""Whats Your Number?"" feel less like a boundary-buster than a bandwagon-follower. Its a cynical exercise in marketing masquerading as a maverick. The premise of ""Whats Your Number?"" is also statistical. After breaking up with Rick - Allys 19th lover - Ally reads in a womens magazine that most women who have had 20 or more sex partners will never get married. Panicking - especially after getting drunk and sleeping with the boss who has just fired her (Joel McHale) - Ally vows to stay celibate until she can dig up as many of her exes as possible hoping that one of them in the interim has turned into the man of her dreams. For the most part the former-boyfriend cameos - which include Andy Samberg as a nerdy ventriloquist and Anthony Mackie as a now-gay politician - arent clever. Chris Pratt of ""Parks and Recreation"" playing a happily engaged man who comes to believe that Ally is stalking him is the rare exception. Assisting Ally in the detective work is her across-the-hall neighbor Colin (Chris Evans) a sweet but seemingly commitmentphobic hottie who spends a substantial screen time in various states of undress. This should tell you a lot about where the story is going as well as just how superficial it is. At least in ""Bridesmaids"" Chris ODowds rendition of the dreamboat-right-under-your-nose character was dryly hilarious. Evans may be easy on the eyes and the actor does have a laid-back charm. But hes no comedian. Faris for her part fares better. Despite a raspy voice thats less sexy than annoying - you keep wishing that shed clear her throat or have it checked for polyps - the actress has enough screwball charm to make you wish for better material. Not that ""Whats Your Number?"" is totally devoid of sweetness or humor. The offbeat wedding vows recited by Allys sister and her groom (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) are quirky and wry. And at the very end there is one genuinely laugh-inducing moment. It comes in the form of a voice-mail message delivered by Aziz Ansari (also of ""Parks and Rec"" coincidentally) playing yet another of Allys ex-boyfriends. As filthy as it is funny the short message cant be described in a family newspaper. Still its the best thing about the movie. Admittedly thats not saying much considering that it comes after nearly two hours of focus-group-tested tedium.Contains flashes of nudity steady obscenity and a stream of raunchy if strained humor.

Ally (Anna Faris) sneaks out of bed to apply makeup before her partner wakes reminding audiences of Kristen Wiig and Jon Hamms similar funnier moment. Faris and co-star Chris Evans have an easy charm and sharp comic timing but this by-the-numbers romantic comedy isnt worthy of their talents.Ally is a daffy girl who reads a magazine article that rocks her world. The article claims that women who sleep with 20 or more men are likely to have self-esteem issues which can jeopardize finding a lasting mate. Ally has just achieved the dreaded number of partners and fears a life of lonely spinsterhood. So she seeks to outwit the statistical system by doubling back and embarking on a wacky search of former lovers. Her goal is to find the one that got away and settle down.Faris does her best to inject some appealing quirkiness into shallow Ally but the script focuses mostly on humorless vulgarity. There is however one funny scene when Ally tries to impress a former beau whom she once fooled into thinking she was British. Her deteriorating Brit accent all these years later is a hoot.About the movieWhats Your Number?  out of fourStars Anna Faris Chris Evans Blythe Danner Ed Begley Jr.Director Mark MylodDistributor 20th Century Fox Rating R for sexual content and language Running time 1 hour 46 minutes Opens Friday nationwideEvans plays Colin Allys hunky neighbor. He lives across the hall and hides out in her place to escape any morning-after commitment impinging on his merry life of one-night stands. Captain America notwithstanding Evans is no mere superhero with killer abs. He should try taking on better-written romcoms since he clearly has the wit looks and personality.The thin premise here seems better suited to a sitcom episode than a full-length feature. Thats not surprising given that director Mark Mylods resume includes British TV comedies and Entourage episodes.Given the storys conceit of revisiting old flames its hard not to be reminded of a far better movie 2000s High Fidelity. Though in that film the trips down memory lane were inspired by a more intelligent urge -- to understand what went wrong in the various romances. Theres nothing remotely close to soul-searching here.Faris and Evans have visible chemistry and Ally and Colin are obviously made for each other but it takes them most of the movie to figure it out. Why? Because tired conventions dictate it be that way. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

WYN-267 A A Ally Darling (Anna Faris) and Colin Shea (Chris Evans) discover the shocking secret about one of her exes in ""Whats Your Number?"" Photo Claire Folger Twentieth Century Fox Whats Your Number? review zero nada none 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Whats Your Number? Romantic comedy. Starring Anna Faris and Chris Evans. Directed by Mark Mylod. (R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its a given of romantic comedy that the characters are worthy of love that its just understood that somebody somewhere should be able to love them - otherwise it would be really depressing. But theres a revealing moment near the end of ""Whats Your Number?"" in which the heroine played by Anna Faris refers to herself as a ""jobless whore."" And all you can think when you hear that is ""OK perceptive enough but why did you leave out obnoxious pathetic and vile? "" Dont make the mistake of taking ""Whats Your Number?"" seriously or you might see it as a movie that disrespects women sex life the audience and while were at it Aristotle. But its too inept to be actively trying to take down Western Civilization. At best its an anomaly and at worst its not the means of social collapse but evidence of a collapse that has already taken place. Faris is a pretty delicate-looking actress with a lowdown abandoned sense of comedy that has served her well in supporting roles - she was flat-out hysterical in ""Observe and Report"" as a trashy cosmetics-counter girl. So it probably seemed a natural step forward for her to star here as Ally who looks up one day and decides that she has had too many lovers. In order not to add more lovers to her roster she starts looking for Mr. Right among her past partners. Related Stories Review Whats Your Number? That might sound potentially amusing but its a structure that allows for no forward motion. It can only be a succession of losers because Chris Evans the clear romantic lead is not on the list. He plays a musician who lives on the same floor as Ally and has sex with a different woman every night - then flees his apartment each morning until the woman leaves. Apparently it never occurs to him to avoid this inconvenience by going to the womans place but then hes as short on brains as he is on morals. The attempt here - and this is only a guess because its such a mess - was to make a harsh romance about two people whove been around and arent sentimental about love. (""Going the Distance"" which was excellent was something like that.) But he is borderline evil and she is a completely helpless flailing fool and theres no reason to think they would stay together for a month. Usually screen romances are in some ways surrogate experiences for viewers. But really if the dimensions broke down and the movie and the theater suddenly shared the same reality the woman Faris plays here couldnt find a willing boyfriend in the viewing audience - including a matinee with a bunch of old cranks. Shes hopeless hes hopeless and this movie is just ghastly. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

"Whats Your Number? Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Magic NumberMovie review Whats Your Number?Anna Faris sharp comedic talents are wasted in a sub-par romantic comedy.September 30 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Ally (Anna Faris) decides to search through guys shes already dated... (Claire Folger / Twentieth...)Anna Faris is so adorably entertaining that she can say things like a oh lets see what can we print here a well she can say very bad words which shes often asked to do in films in fall-down funny and completely forgivable ways. Shes got a perpetually sunshiny face that looks as if its always playing catch-up there to put the punctuation mark on whatever naughty bit shes just uttered while making the most of that sling-back mouth those eye-popping baby blues the nose crinkles (who knew a nose could be played for such comic effect?). You cant help but wonder what it would be like to see her at the center of a really really funny film that was really really smart. What we have before us instead is ""Whats Your Number?"" a not very good romantic comedy made somewhat bearable by Faris. It was supposed to be one of those films that lets women break through the R-rated comedy glass ceiling but ""Bridesmaids"" beat it to the punch this summer and with much better punch lines. The basic operating principle here is that for women there is a magic number when it comes to love a if you havent found Mr. Right by the time youve slept with 20 guys youre unlikely to. Ever. At least according to an article in Marie Claire that Ally (Faris) spots. Karyn Bosnaks frothy book ""20 Times a Lady"" started all this with sitcom-tested Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden adapting it for the big screen. Director Mark Mylod whos spent a lot of time filming the exploits of ""Entourage"" so an old hand at sexy comedy in 30-minute bursts is theoretically in control although not as much as he should be. The film is set in Boston a nice scenic change of pace after far too many New York City sets and opens on a day that is already turning out to be tough for Ally. Shes just been fired but worse she realizes her body count of boys shes bedded is at the tipping point. If unemployment and too many sexual encounters werent enough her nearly perfect younger sister Daisy (Ari Graynor) is getting ready to tie the knot. Daisys march toward an ""I do"" will serve as ""normal"" against all of Allys outrages and there are about to be a lot of them because shes decided to look up all her past loves to see if she can find her future soul mate among them. Of course the guy who just may be the real deal is not on this list. Colin (Chris Evans) is a hunky struggling musician with a revolving door of one-night stands. He lives right across the hall from Ally. And a this is the most important part a he retrieves his morning paper in the buff with just a dish towel to cover his privates. Right. All I can say is if more apartments had guys like Colin around newspapers wouldnt need to worry about circulation numbers. Anyway he and Ally meet when theyre in the midst of mutual avoidance of their latest bedfellows. They soon develop a barter arrangement a hell help track down her exes if he can use her apartment to hide out from all those dicey morning-afters. And so were off to the races. But hold your horses heres the problemo. As lovely and likable as Faris is as hunky and soulful as Evans can be they really dont make for a good romantic match. Its hard to root for them to get together because although Ally and Colin seem perfectly nice they dont seem like they were ever meant to be more than friends. There is comfort but no I repeat no chemistry. There are other issues as well. The filmmakers dont seem to know what to do with all the time theyve got and theyve got way too much of it. There are moments an Ally meltdown or two among them that are blazingly comic and Blythe Danner is delightful as Allys overbearing never satisfied mother. But much more of the movie is merely mundane. You really do feel like theyre checking off a list working hard to get through all the exes. With 20 there are a lot of them including the latest ex (Zachary Quinto) the once-fat now-slim ex (Chris Pratt) the Brit (Martin Freeman) the doc (Thomas Lennon) the former boss (Joel McHale) the magician (Mike Vogel) the puppeteer (Andy Samberg) the gay politician (Anthony Mackie) and the perfect one the holy grail of rich handsome and available played by Dave Annable. Thankfully were only required to catch up with these nine but whos counting a| Faris whos been such a bright spot in so many marginal films (""Observe amp; Report"" ""Take Me Home Tonight"") and a brighter spot in some fairly good ones (""The House Bunny"" the ""Scary Movie"" franchise) is definitely overdue for that project that is a perfect match with her comic talents.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Theres nothing new in ""Whats Your Number? Its that awkward tedious monster mash of ""chick flick and romantic comedy - a flatulent issue of Glamour in a Hildy Johnson hat. What it does confirm is that neither genre is an easy home for the lunatic skills of Anna Faris a comedian whose address is somewhere on Planet Farce.Its not that you dont want to see her fall in love. Its that you dont want to see her fall in love in whats basically a Katherine Heigl movie by another name. (Thats how barren the romantic-comic universe is ""a Katherine Heigl movie actually means something.)In any case Faris applies her not-that-dumb-blonde stylings to the story of Ally a freshly fired Boston woman who learns from Harvard or Marie Claire that if she exceeds her 20-sex-partner ceiling something awful might befall her pelvic floor. Or something like that. She vows to dig around among her exes and one-night-stands for a suitable life mate. Her having been recently fired only gives her extra time to say travel to Washington where one old boyfriend (Anthony Mackie) asks for her hand in marriage so that they can conquer the Beltway with him as closeted homosexual and her as his beard. That of course is the movie we should be paying to see - a sexy black gay guy and a pratfall-prone platinum blonde climbing the political ladder.But the movie isnt that ambitious. It looked for a moment as if Ally would join Nicki Minaj and Jenna Maroney of ""30 Rock as one of the few women in popular culture right now who arent afraid of or embarrassed by their sexuality. But Ally opts for recycling old sex into new love which in the movies is a sort of moral alchemy that in life never works.Allys sister (Ari Graynor) is getting married and with her wedding comes the expected parade of tired gags - the uptight mother and whip-cracking sister. But its not all bad just formulaic from start to finish. Director Mark Mylod and the screenwriters Gabrielle Allen and Jennifer Crittenden - adapting a novel by Karyn Bosnak called ""20 Times a Lady - do turn Boston into the glamorous city that we take for granted and they smooth out the bawdiness and broadness so that theres a degree of recognizable humanness among the women. This is one of the few such movies where thats the case but that might have something to do with there being no part for Kate Hudson.The movie squanders an opportunity for satire in D.C. but it does give Chris Evans as the inevitable Mr. Right a chance to remind us that hes truly not an action figure. Hes a natural clown - and the only actor in Hollywood with a five oclock shadow on his chest. In his naturalness hes hot. He plays the Dude Across the Hall and the reason he and Faris work so well together is that he finds his hotness funny in the same way that Faris does hers. These two need another braver movie together preferably one in which sex means never having to say youre sorry.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

She will do anything for a laugh and does in Whats Your Number? Faris is endearing even at those times when this frantic Ive-slept-with- 19-guys comedy is barely endurable. Slideshow Time to reconsider the 19 guys she bedded Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Whats Your Number? >> Since this is a movie starring a woman who is not Julia Roberts or Meryl Streep it follows that it is about a single girl desperate for a mate. Her name is Ally. Complicating her desperation is feeling that she is unworthy of love because she has had too many sexual encounters. How many is too many? For Allys mother (Blythe Danner) that would be 1. For her sister (Ari Graynor) that would be 4. For the magazine she consults as if it were Gospel that would be 20. Women who have had 20 or more close encounters says the magazine are unlikely to find a lasting partner. Allys number is ... 19. So that she does not hit or exceed the official ""slut number"" Ally sets out to find which of her exes might be recycled. This during the run-up to her sisters wedding. Did the screenwriters order up a double shot of Ghosts of Boyfriends Past with a 27 Dresses chaser? Allys accomplice in tracking down her former beaux is Colin (Chris Evans of Captain America renown) the player who lives across the hall and seeks refuge in Allys flat as the hookup from the previous night vacates his premises. Even for farce the films premise is pretty contrived. Plus its garish and so overlit that in scenes the actors resemble Madame Tussauds waxworks. But the thing about Faris the humor-seeking missile in Scary Movie The House Bunny and Lost in Translation is that she is brazen in her pursuit of the laugh. Dance like a demented dervish fall flat on her face drunk lie like Pinocchio - this womanchild with the face of Goldie Hawn and the comic neurological system of Jerry Lewis gives it 200 percent. In some scenes Faris sheer velocity gives the movie liftoff. In others it doesnt hurt that Evans who looks like the very young Alec Baldwin and has the sonorous voice of Mark Feuerstein is the films sex object. Even someone not ordinarily an advocate of sexual objectification can make an exception in his case. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Whats Your Number? Rated R  106 minutes  2011 Based on a chick-lit novel by Chicagoan Karyn Bosnak this grating romantic comedy stars Anna Faris as an unemployed single in Boston whose bad luck with men can be attributed to too much alcohol and too little sense. After she reads in a magazine that women whove had sex with 20 or more men will never marry she realizes to her horror that shes slept with 19. Chris Evans plays the womanizing neighbor she enlists to locate her old boyfriends in the hope that one of them will turn out to be Mr. Right after all. Typical of the movies double standard is the fact that she refers to herself as a ""whore"" while her male pal is supposed to seem appealing because he drops his trousers early and often.

"Whats Your Number? (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Whats Your Number? (R) Count on having a good time Anna Faris in a scene from Whats Your Number?. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com9/28/2011 Editor rating 2.5 There arent many romantic comedies in which the heroine loudly proclaims ""Im a jobless whore"" But as the amusing if silly Whats Your Number? proves things have changed. This isnt your mothers clean-cut romcom with only a chaste smooch at the end although it shares many of the properties required of such movies the planning of a wedding; a protagonist who cant see the man of her dreams even though he lives right across the hall and is hot enough to cause spontaneous combustion; a super-cute funky apartment the heroine couldnt possibly afford; the race across town to declare true feelings. Still this is the year of the raunchy bridesmaid and Whats Your Number? is not about to be left behind. The movie shies away from the scatological jokes that Kristen Wiig and Co. happily reveled in but its full of lively and crude sexual banter discussions of hookups and sex and Joel McHales bare butt (unless theres a stunt man involved always a possibility). Oddly all this makes the film funnier and more accessible than you might imagine. The film stars Anna Faris (Take Me Home Tonight The House Bunny) as Ally Darling who has just been fired from her marketing job in Boston (McHale of Community and The Soup plays the creepy boss who canned her). Idly reading a magazine she comes across an article reporting that the average number of sexual partners for women is 10. Ally counts back comes up with 19 panics and makes a swift decision She will not sleep with No.20 unless hes The One. Her vow is broken almost immediately at her sisters bachelorette party which sends her Google-stalking her exes to see if she let a good one get away. Aiding her on this quest is her jaw-droppingly handsome neighbor Colin (Chris Evans of Captain America) who agrees to help in exchange for a place to hide out every morning from the women he has bedded the previous night (in hopes of encouraging them to leave quickly). For the record Evans is almost naked in several scenes and shirtless in many others and this fact alone will be more than enough to inspire some of you to see this movie. I dont need to tell you what happens between Ally and Colin do I? By now youve seen enough romcoms to know. But the chemistry between Faris and Evans is actually pretty wonderful and the film even gives Ally a good reason to be wary of him Hes charming and sweet under all that hotness but hes a player and shes had enough players. She wants Mr. Right and a guy who looks and acts like Colin is Mr. Right Now. The exes include the great Chris Pratt (Parks and Recreation - and Faris real-life spouse) Anthony Mackie Martin Freeman and Andy Samberg though the trailer footage of Samberg with his puppets is sadly conspicuously absent.

Neither a Bridesmaid nor a Bride Even the gifted Anna Faris cant elevate this dopey rom-com By Mary Pols MaryPolsSept. 28 2011 Share Read Later 20th Century Fox Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture While thumbing through a womens magazine on the subway a young-ish Bostonian named Ally Darling (Anna Faris) happens on an article positing that 96 percent of women who have slept with 20 or more men will never marry. Ally was laid off from her job only moments before but the heroine of Whats Your Number? is far more rattled by the possibility that her number -- at that time 19 -- will jeopardize her chances at marriage. Just imagine what Jane Austen would have done with this Sluts and Non-Sensibility scenario. Directed by Mark Mylod Whats Your Number? is not much dumber than the average romantic comedy but there is something sad and infuriating about it -- like running into a high school friend who seemed destined for greatness and walking away realizing she just picked your pocket. Theres always been something vulnerable about Faris an ease of conveying innocence and decency but shes also capable of very sly characterizations like the unforgettable silly movie star in Lost in Translation. As with most scene stealers she creates an urge for more of whatever shes doing. If she can make something as unpleasant as Observe and Report bearable for even two minutes logic suggests someone should give her more starring roles with closer to 90 minutes on screen. That may still be true but the 106 minutes of Whats Your Number are not the right ones. Fariss timing is as good as ever but having the gifted parodist play it straight for the most part -- theres a fun bit with a fake British accent -- seems like a waste of comic resources. Allys main quality seems to be malleability. Cowed by research found in Marie Claire she vows chastity until she meets husband material worthy of being 20. She does this in a bar surrounded by friends and shot glasses and in the morning wakes up with company. Having accidentally hit the magic number she decides to work back through her list to find someone to marry. She enlists her strapping neighbor Colin (Chris Evans) to help track down ex-lovers (that Google is so complicated) in exchange for allowing him to hide from his romantic conquests in her apartment. The writing is on the wall although the way Colin leers does provide a modicum of suspense. ""Your rapey neighbor?"" Allys friend asks of him. ""Do we call him that?"" Ally answers faintly. Yes yes we do Me and you and everyone we know. The past is bleak. Theres a beau who is now an OB/GYN and recognizes her only mid-Pap smear; a closeted gay man (Anthony Mackie) for whom she pretended to be conservative during college; and a formerly overweight man she called Disgusting Donald (Moneyballs Chris Pratt Fariss off-screen husband) who serves to make a good point about Allys superficiality. Revisiting lovers was done to such better effect in High Fidelity where it had a legitimate purpose. Allys undertaking is so thinly motivated; screenwriters Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden could just as well have justified it by bringing in a fairy godmother to enchant her. This movie has the misfortune of opening with a set piece identical to the one that opens Bridesmaids with Ally sneaking back into bed with 19 (Zachary Quinto) after prettying herself up. There are other similarities a wedding provides the narrative scaffolding Ally delivers an awkward toast at her sister Daisys (Ari Graynor) engagement party and a blue-collar guy comes to the rescue. But in each case Whats Your Number falls short in comparison; the clever truths about friendship and love that made Bridesmaids special are missing along with any confidence that the heroine is capable of self respect. Moreover Whats Your Number? doesnt think out of the box despite having an atypical star. Faris goes through the rom-com heroine motions getting drunk in public falling off high heels stuffing a hot dog in her mouth. Whichever long-ago focus group determined that pretty women in movies would be more endearing if they ate like construction workers on 3-minute breaks should be found and force-fed hot dogs as penance. It looks and feels like every other rom-com with the usual mise-en-scene of artistically disheveled and absurdly enormous apartments intercut with enough urban shots to establish place but not community; I could watch this movie in my sleep. The screenplay does include an acknowledgement by one character mid-pursuit to profess love that it would have been easier to just go back to the persons apartment and wait for them. Ha. But acknowledging the dopiness of other rom-coms doesnt make this movie smarter if the screenwriters knew it was silly why didnt they write a smarter ending? Colin tells Ally ""You seem like the kind of girl who tries to make a bad thing work."" True of Faris as well but try as she may gifted as she is she cant make this bad thing work.

Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 1 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr September 28 2011 | 0748PM PT Its never a good sign when the funniest line in your romantic comedy is ""Did you visit the Holocaust museum?"" Its never a good sign when the funniest line in your romantic comedy is ""Did you visit the Holocaust museum?"" and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Such is the case with ""Whats Your Number?"" a draggy generally laugh-free outing that wastes a perfectly good Anna Faris here playing a spacy sexpot who decides after having slept with 20 different guys that its probably time to settle down. With Chris Evans cast as an all-too-obvious Mr. Right this inane Ill-never-be-slutty-again farce should post OK theatrical and homevid numbers for Fox. Ditched by her latest fling (Zachary Quinto) about five minutes after the opening credits Ally Darling (Faris) is a boozy Boston blonde whose dating standards have plunged lower than her neckline. When she reads a magazine article about how the average American woman has 10.5 lovers over her lifetime Ally realizes shes slept with nearly twice that number and is in danger of making herself unmarriageable. That shes recently lost her job and has no apparent interests beyond making clay-figurine dioramas doesnt improve her prospects. Resolving to stop fooling around and find a husband Ally decides to look up her ex-boyfriends one by one in hopes of rekindling an old flame without raising her number to 21. Helping her with some detective work is her neighbor Colin (Evans) a laid-back guitarist and serial womanizer whos clearly hot for Ally himself though shes wary of hooking up with someone even more whorish than she is. So begins a series of mirthless wild-goose chases as Colin helps Ally stalk her exes across the country. One of them (Chris Pratt) seems to have shed a few hundred pounds and is now engaged to a sexy engineer; another (Anthony Mackie) asks her to marry him for the least romantic possible reasons. She steers clear of the more nightmarish suitors who are relegated to flashbacks. Allys clearly wasting her time and the viewer may come to feel likewise. Unable to build or sustain comic situations Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittendens script (adapted from Karyn Bosnaks novel ""20 Times a Lady"") resorts to jokes so random and context-free they almost qualify as non sequiturs cueing viewers to laugh when a bit player turns out to be a compulsive finger-sniffer or when Allys hair catches fire for no reason. Less vulgar and over-the-top than some of the years other R-rated comedies ""Number"" riffs on the pitfalls of promiscuity en route to a predictably safe sweet pro-commitment happy ending. Viewers will get their fill of coy near-nudity and genital-centric one-liners but none of the sophistication or honesty about gender-based double standards they might reasonably expect from such a scenario. Pic does bear a vague resemblance to recent summer hit ""Bridesmaids"" in the way it uses an upcoming wedding (that of Allys sister nicely played by Ari Graynor) to zero in on a single gals early-midlife funk but its portrait of distaff distress is nowhere near as insightful or funny. A superior comic actress whose talents have been better showcased elsewhere Faris works little of her usual magic here largely because the film essentially shares Allys dim opinion of herself. Theres no secret-weapon intelligence or killer timing behind Faris ditzy veneer this time; she really is just playing a dumb blonde who cant hold her liquor. Evans nice smile and nicer muscles get the job done and Blythe Danner and Ed Begley Jr. submit OK turns as Allys divorced parents. Glossily helmed by Mark Mylod (""Ali G Indahouse"") and crammed with tiresome pop-slathered montages ""Number"" also teems with references to Facebook and Twitter that are meant to show how up-to-the-minute the film is but will have the effect of dating it instantly.

If anything this proves that the actress needs some quick career counseling unless shes looking to become the next Kate Hudson. Whats Your Number? Bad Director Mark Mylod. Cast Anna Faris Chris Evans Blythe Danner. Rating R for sexual content and language. This weeks new movie releases Here Faris plays Ally a ditz who reads in Marie Claire that once an unmarried woman has more than 20 lovers she is doomed to be alone. In an only-in-a-rom-com setup she decides to revisit her past bedmates with the help of the hunky guy (Chris Evans) who lives across the hall. Interview Anna Faris Sometimes the guys turn out to be losers -- one gay fellow wants Ally to be his beard -- and at other times she is simply clueless. With a likable British beau named Simon (Martin Freeman from ""Love Actually"") Ally pretends to be English and starts speaking with an Eliza Doolittle accent. That is one of the movies biggest flaws. Ally isnt really a character; instead shes a device that bends to whatever the screenplay demands. At times she is quite smart and witty; in other moments you wonder if the character suffered a head injury at some point in her life. The films lack of common sense reaches out-of-control proportions in the final minutes as Ally races from wedding to wedding searching for the man she has decided to spend her life with. ""Why didnt I just go wait for him at his apartment?"" she wonders. Its as if the character is pointing out just how lame the film is.

Whats Your Number? draws on appeal of Faris Evans BY JOE WILLIAMS gt; Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 Sep 29 2011 (...) Anna Faris and Chris Evans star in ""Whats Your Number?"" For every movie theres a motive and in the case of the sex comedy ""Whats Your Number?"" it might not be as bogus as it seems. Anna Faris is a funny woman a Meg Ryan among stoner chicks and she deserves to have a hit like ""Bridesmaids."" This is a pale imitation of that libidinous laughfest but it does induce a few giggles like cheap champagne.Faris plays a Boston bachelorette named Ally. While prepping for the wedding of her sister (Ari Graynor) Ally reads an article suggesting that women with more than 20 lifetime hook-ups are unlikely to find true love. Because shes perched on the pivotal number Ally decides to locate her ex-lovers and determine whether any of them are marriage material. The gimmicky premise is an excuse to pair Ally with Colin (Chris Evans) a hunky promiscuous neighbor with amateur detective skills. Between meetings with ex-lovers who include a ventriloquist (Andy Samberg) a gynecologist (Thomas Lennon) and an ersatz Henry Higgins (Martin Freeman) Ally and Colin predictably grow close. He encourages her to make art she encourages him to make music they play a late-night game of strip basketball at Boston Garden yada yada. But Colin cant commit and Allys got a date for her sisters wedding with the blueblood (Dave Annable) preferred by her mother (Blythe Danner).""Whats Your Number?"" is such a stereotypical sex comedy that it sometimes seems like a variation on ""The Scary Movie"" motif. Both Faris and Evans have starred in such parody flicks so they keep it fun and frisky. This movie isnt as daring as it pretends to be but with two likable stars and a quotient of absurdity ""Whats Your Number?"" gets a passing grade.

"Whats Your Number? movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Whats Your Number? counts on a dated premise a 2 starsSeptember 29 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticAnna Farris stars in ""Whats Your Number?""Its a close call given the lousiness and the scolding tone of much of her material but Anna Faris survives ""Whats Your Number?"" with eccentric comic charm intact. Dumb film; smart comedienne.Audiences take to Faris for many reasons. Shes fearless. She has no vanity. She doesnt look like every other ""pretty but funny"" prototype in Hollywood. She can take a pratfall. She can seem simultaneously dim and bright a beat behind the action while mysteriously a step ahead of it which is how most of us feel at any given moment but she knows how to get laughs with that combination.As executive producer Faris helped develop the Boston-set romantic comedy from the book ""20 Times a Lady"" which operates from a defeatist premise I reject utterly but well get to that in a sec. Its implied that the recently laid-off marketing department flunky Ally the Faris character has been dumped 19 straight times in her life. Chronically between unsatisfying relationships she approaches the imminent marriage of her younger sister (Ari Graynor) with a touch of envy.A chance encounter with a Marie Claire magazine article sends Ally into a low-grade panic. If shes had twice the national average (10.5) of sexual partners does that mean shes unmarryable?Thus begins Allys film-long rummage through her roster of exes. With the help of the frequently naked sensitive hunky Lothario across the hall (Chris Evans) she begins a search for Mr. Right presuming he mustve come and gone without her realizing it (Andy Samberg Anthony Mackie and Chris Pratt have cameos in that lineup). Shell do anything to avoid that dreaded No. 20.There is real potential in the notion of a malleable insecure protagonist who has tried to be someone different to suit each new unsuitable relationship. But in strange ways the ""Whats Your Number?"" screenplay plenty coarse without being plentifully witty gives Faris all the room she needs while shackling Ally her character to anachronistic Doris Day-era sexual attitudes.Im sorry and I know Im a guy but who cares how many people so-and-so has slept with? To have the entire movie hung up on this issue only to dismiss it as stupid in the end feels all wrong. The humiliation games played on Anna are more depressing than spirited and old standbys such as the awkward drunken toast in front of the family (Blythe Danner plays Allys hypercritical mother) fall flat. And would Ally even if she comes from money really fly around the country visiting smarmy ex-boyfriends just to see if theyve improved?Under the workmanlike direction of Mark Mylod Faris keeps this fits-and-starts affair from sputtering completely. Ill close with one example that wont sound amusing but is. At one point Allys hair extensions catch fire at an outdoor restaurant and she tosses them into a nearby fountain just in time for her date to not know whats going on. Then owing to residual smoke in the air she lets out a little cough. A quick one. But her timing is brilliant. And after I laughed -- I remember I did because itd been a while -- I did what I generally disdain at movie screenings. Out loud I said ""Finally""mjphillipstribune.comWhats Your Number? -- 2 starsMPAA rating R (for sexual content and language)Cast Anna Faris (Ally); Chris Evans (Colin); Ari Graynor (Daisy); Blythe Danner (Ava);Credits Directed by Mark Mylod; written by Gabrielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden based on the book ""20 Times a Lady"" by Karyn Bosnak; produced by Beau Flynn and Tripp Vinson.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The gimmicky new romantic comedy Whats Your Number? takes place in a strange time warp where attitudes about sex and promiscuity change dramatically from scene to scene. In one sequence members of a bridal party trade bawdy sex talk; in another a future mogul expresses something approaching horror at the prospect that a woman in her 30s like Anna Faris might have had sex with more than two people. It turns out Whats Your Number? isnt any smarter or savvier about sex and its collateral damage than the idiotic fake womens-magazine study that provides its premise. The perpetually underserved Faris stars as a recently fired Boston marketer whos devastated to read a study in a womens magazine stating that a woman whos had more than 20 sexual partners has a 4 percent chance of getting married. Rather than dismissing the study as sexist scare-mongering drivel Faris decides to base her life around it. Since she has had exactly 20 lovers Faris makes an extensive voyage through her sexual history to discover whether her future might lie in her distant and not-so-distant past. Chris Evans assumes Matthew McConaugheys throne of regal shirtlessness as Faris neighbor a charming clothing-averse cad who agrees to help her track down her exes (he comes from a family of cops) in exchange for her letting him hide from his endless bevy of gorgeous one-night stands in her suspiciously enormous apartment. Theres a smart funny observant comedy-drama to be made about the role our romantic pasts play in determining our futures but director Mark Mylod and screenwriters Jennifer Crittenden (a Simpsons veteran who really should know better) and Gabrielle Allan are less interested in making that movie than in cycling Faris through a series of non-starting encounters with one-note-joke ex-flings like the terminally British Martin Freeman or closeted gay Republican Anthony Mackie. Faris and Evans have frisky chemistry until a dire endless third act separates them for the most arbitrary reasons. When Whats Your Number? works at all its a testament to the charm and magnetism of the heroically unselfconscious Faris. She delivers a joyously unashamed performance in a flailing sputtering rom-com that gives her and the rest of a supremely overqualified cast ample cause for embarrassment.

Film Review 745 PM PDT 9/28/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Claire Folger/Twentieth Century Fox Anna Faris with an assist from co-star Chris Evans turns a formulaic rom-com into a surprisingly sweet romance. TWITTER The romantic comedy centers on a woman who vows that her next hook-up will be The One. The couple arrives in a creaky vehicle leaking fluids and tires completely shot but hey it got them to the party. Anna Faris and Chris Evans are the couple in question and together they brighten up a lame idea for a romantic comedy in Whats Your Number? so well that you keep thinking this isnt such a bad concept after all. Well yes it is but to their credit a support team that includes not only other actors but director Mark Mylod and screenwriters Garbielle Allan and Jennifer Crittenden realize a good thing when they see it Set your stellar performers up with good line and physical shtick then get out of their way. For this is a rom-com by the numbers. Literally. Numbers dominate the premise but -- bottom line -- the numbers may pencil out quite well for Fox with its weekend release of a modestly budgeted savvy product for female audiences. And guys may see a few figures they dont mind looking at either. STORY Anna Faris to Star Opposite Sacha Baron Cohen in The Dictator Heres the premise In America the average woman has 10.5 lovers in her lifetime. And 96% of women whove been with 20 or more lovers cant find a husband this according to a study by one Dr. Helen Fig. (No the joke is too obvious.) So the films heroine one Ally Darling (Faris) decides during an inebriated evening celebrating the impending nuptials of her younger sister (Ari Graynor) in their hometown of Boston that the numbers arent running in her favor. So-o-o ... she vows that man No. 20 -- yes shes about to reach that number -- will be The One. Then she sleeps with the creep who just fired her. Oops. Now if her vow not to exceed the No. 20 is to mean anything she must revisit Nos. 1-19 to find the right one. Even the Internet isnt that helpful tracking down those unsuspecting males however. But the guy across the landing from her apartment Colin (Evans) who beds a different bimbo each night has a family in the police business and a natural instinct for finding anybody. EXCLUSIVE Anna Faris Sells Stalker Comedy Project to Paramount Okay so you know instantly how this is going to play out but the playing-out is the whole fun. The two confab about Allys various past ""exes"" she ambushes a few for comic sequences Ally amp; Colin become real friends her sisters wedding has its own comic bumps and then theres the melodrama about dad (Ed Begley Jr.) showing up at the wedding and just how much this will upset Allys patrician mom (Blythe Danner). To paraphrase Noel Coward its extraordinary how potent cheap rom-com is. None of this should play well. It does because Faris and Evans work hard to make it look easy. Faris is oft compared to Lucille Ball but why not? Shes got the beauty awkwardness and guile down pat. She absolutely makes this movie which would otherwise be exasperating. Her timing is impeccable and her enthusiasm contagious. Evans role is more subservient to the heroine and would get lost with a less personable and accomplished comic actor. He definitely plays second fiddle to Faris but what an orchestra they make. STORY Captain Americas Chris Evans Talks Avengers Co-Stars and Raging Insecurity The rest of the movie has good and bad points -- mostly good. The supporting cast does what it should excellent use is made of Boston locations nicely blended with a superior interior set -- designer Jon Billington take your bow ---- and the writers and director achieve a nice nonchalance in how the story unfolds. Mild vulgarity and discreet nudity garner the sought-after R rating but this effort feels forced. The real ""bad"" here is the sheer formulaic nature of everything. There are no surprises but for once you dont much mind. There are more than four weddings in the movie but no funerals so a happy ending is assured. In fact that may be the worst ""bad"" here. There was room for a more ambiguous ending maybe one that found the movies Darling wondering what No. 22 might be like.

So says the survey that prompts Ally (Anna Faris) whose number is 20 to scour her list of exes in search of Mr Right. Shes helped by her womanising neighbour Colin (Chris Evans) a slacker musician whos picked up  stalking tips from his cop father.Surprisingly Evans out-funnies the likeable Faris with his comic turn as the permanently topless sidekick. The inevitable romance however feels less fresh and comes complete with a superfluous game of strip basketball (not enough to explain this layabouts abs).Based on the book 20 Times a Lady by Karyn Bosnak this has a healthy respect for raunch and a handle on the concerns of some modern women. But it doesnt make deft comic work of them as Bridesmaids did. There are decent one-liners but Allys insecurities follow the whims of the plot more than a convincing character outline. And so this becomes a throwaway giggle rather than a life-affirming mirror for that swelling box-office target the single woman.

We have all been here before and seen the slightly kooky nice but not smart actress try to carry a film and not quite carry it off. Faris is nice and Evans is amusing but sadly it isnt enough. The ""scene"" is set by the cliches at play with both characters managing a lifestyle way beyond their apparent means and inhabiting that world you only see in certain American movies where no one is ugly and no one is fat. All in all light and fluffy and not disagreeable just not that rewarding. Not the worst but far from the best.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/90391/whats-your-number.html,200,what'syournumber?29,what'syournumber?,timeout
