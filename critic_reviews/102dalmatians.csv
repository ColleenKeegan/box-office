Publicity photo Image 2 of 2 Glenn Close in ""102 Dalmations."" Publicity photo Glenn Close in ""102 Dalmations."" Publicity photo Cruella Unleashed / Glenn Close steals the show in Disneys 102 Dalmatians 1 / 2 Back to Gallery 102 DALMATIANS Childrens movie. Starring Glenn Close and Alice Evans. Directed by Kevin Lima. (Rated G. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""102 Dalmatians"" is the kind of holiday movie that makes people wish they were kids so they might like it a little better. It has everything -- cuddly animals colorful outfits and sight gags not to mention plenty of people talking in the sort of English accent heard for some reason only in Disney movies. For the adults there is but one attraction but its a substantial one -- Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil. ""102 Dalmatians"" which opens today is the sequel to the live-action ""101 Dalmatians"" from 1996. Directed by Kevin Lima (""Tarzan"") it is far and away the better of the two ""Dalmatians"" for a number of reasons. At the top of the list is that in this one Cruella gets to cut loose. Screenwriters Kristen Buckley and Brian Regan have come up with an amusing premise Cruella De Vil has been rehabilitated. She leaves prison asking that people call her ""Ella not Cruella"" and pledges to devote herself to animal rights. If Close is funny as the evil Cruella she is even funnier as the kindly Cruella doing her best to suppress her inexhaustible capacity for irritation and rage. Watching her is not unlike watching footage of Maria Callas that other grand diva trying to smile for the press. One knows that at any moment the smile will grow fangs and heads will be bitten off. The screenwriters do something else thats wise. They dont try to squeeze 102 dalmatians into the film. They also dont return to the original dog- obsessed family (played in the first film by Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson). Instead they devise an entirely new story about a dalmatian- loving probation officer Chloe (English actress Alice Evans) who has the dubious luck of being assigned to Cruellas case. Evans has the good looks and aura of kindness and sanity that had a way of calming my nerves back in elementary school. She radiates intelligence as well in contrast to Ioan Gruffudd who as her boyfriend Kevin acts more big-eyed and sweet than a neutered puppy. The earlier part of the picture in which Cruella tries to reform are the best. The fun comes in watching her restrain herself playing against her own nature. In one scene she holds a formal dinner for dog-lovers and their pets. She allows the dogs to walk all over the banquet table while she laughs maniacally. The transformation of Ella back into Cruella does not disappoint. It comes in the form of a kind of breakdown in which Cruella suddenly sees all of London -- the sky the streets the cars the people -- as white with black spots. This time out Cruella is not just mean. She is one sick puppy. The second half of the film is not as satisfying but it holds together. Gerard Depardieu one of the least vain actors around shows up as Le Pelt a temperamental French furrier. Close and Depardieu chew up the scenery but Depardieu also chews chicken wings and any other food thats not nailed down. The films title is justified by the fact that 102 dalmatians are needed for Cruella and Le Pelt to succeed in their diabolical plan -- to make a stylish outfit made up entirely of dalmatian skin. ""Ill think of you every time I wear one of your sweet little doggies"" Cruella tells Chloe. When Cruella is not onscreen things tend to bog down and the last half hour heavy on action is the weakest. Adhering to the formula of the previous film the movie indulges in an overlong slapstick bit. It also tries to make a hero of Oddball a dalmatian with no spots. Still in every kids picture there are going to be sections that only kids will enjoy. Fortunately ""102 Dalmatians"" has enough for the adults too.

The Spinal Tap guitarists amps famously went up to 11 because ""its one louder isnt it?"" What sets this sequel apart from 1996s live-action remake of 101 Dalmatians? Well its got one more dog doesnt it? Allegedly rehabilitated after receiving electroshock therapy (mental illness -- aint it a goof?) Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) revives her plan to kidnap 101 puppies to make a dalmatian-fur coat only this time she needs an additional pooch for a hood. She targets a fresh litter owned by her parole officer (Alice Evans) and sets up an animal-shelter operator played by Ioan Gruffudd (star of Aamp;Es Horatio Hornblower) as the fall guy in her scheme. Stuck in the obligatory romantic lead roles Gruffudd and Evans serviceably replace Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson two of the many cast members inexplicably absent from this go-round. Cruellas new partner in crime is Jean Pierre Le Pelt (Gerard Depardieu) a weasel poacher-turned-fur designer. When he first strides onto a fashion-show runway wearing a leopards head as a codpiece Depardieu gooses life into the film. Alas he soon proves a stock henchman unamusing aside from his frenchified pronunciation of puppies as poopies. Speaking of which Depardieus most humiliating moment finds him falling face-first into a commode. Thats merely one of myriad slapstick scenes clumsily staged by director Kevin Lima making his non-animated debut after working with Close on Disneys Tarzan. He makes Stephen Herek (helmer of 96s 101) look like Hitchcock. 102 Dalmatians does boast an aptly cartoonish look. Cruellas elaborate two-tone costumes have once again been cleverly designed by three-time Oscar winner Anthony Powell (Tess) yet Closes performance remains monotonous. She always goes to 11. Screenwriter John Hughes gave the last Dalmatians his Home Alone treatment torturing the villains for sadistic ""comic"" effect. Though Hughes had no hand in the script (its credited to four others) the sequel adds more insults and injuries that could traumatize little ones. Most frightening of all the ending leaves the door open for 103 Dalmatians which would certainly constitute Cruella and unusual punishment.

(Walt Disney Pictures) Walt Disney knows that parents will take their kids to anything during the holiday season even if its the kiddie equivalent of ""Ishtar."" Thats the only plausible explanation for ""102 Dalmatians"" a sequel so dull and formulaic it ought to be leashed and led directly to the doghouse. Obviously this movie (101 minutes - isnt that cute?) is aimed to please young fans. But its paced much too slowly for juvenile fidgeters. Its hard to imagine kids paying more than lukewarm attention to this drone of a movie its insipid romantic couple (Alice Evans and Ioan Gruffudd) and most disappointing of all Glenn Closes toothless encore as Cruella De Vil. The grand dames villainy is so blandified shes just a cackling eccentric in garish clothing schemes. Scary? Naaa. Funny? Hardly. As Monsieur Jean Pierre Le Pelt Cruellas sinister partner in crime Gerard Depardieu isnt amusing so much as a bad sight gag. In his leopard-skin garb his spiked hair and a physique that screams ""No more butter sauce"" he suggests an inflated cross between Rod Stewart and Siegfried amp; Roy. After three years in the slammer for dognapping (in the 1996 live-action movie as opposed to the charming 1961 cartoon original) Cruella De Vil has undergone an apparently miraculous transformation. Shes just darling these days. Released from prison for good behavior she tries to persuade her skeptical probation officer Chloe Simon (Evans) that shes on the straight and narrow. Her first move to save a financially troubled dog shelter run by genial manager Kevin Shepherd (Gruffudd). Has Cruella really learned her lesson? Is she really locking away those expensive fur coats? And can she keep her hands off Chloes Dalmatian puppies Little Dipper Domino and Oddball who happen to be the grand-pups of good old Pongo and Perdy? Prepare for the dullness scripted by a small menagerie of writers and directed by first-timer Kevin Lima. If theres anything moderately funny about this movie its the character of Waddlesworth. As voiced by Eric Idle hes a parrot whos under the delusion that hes a Rottweiler. But lets face it When you need a parrot to save a Dalmatian movie you know youve got problems. ""102 Dalmatians"" (G 101 minutes) - Contains the suggestion of skinned Dalmatians as well as long takes of Gerard Depardieus thighs.

More is not merrier in ""102 Dalmatians"" an overly strenuous sequel to the live-action remake of the animated classic ""101 Dalmatians"" that plays like a pale reworking of its predecessor a perhaps appropriate result for a film that sports 56 people credited as ""spot removal artists."" Still the spectacle of Glenn Closes grandly malevolent Cruella De Vil once again terrorizing the Dalmatian population of London will enthrall moppets and not even a Grinch could prevent these black-and-white canines animatronic and otherwise from chasing down a big B.O. bounty through the holiday season and forever after in ancillary markets. The 1961 cartoon adaptation of Dodie Smiths novel was Disneys biggest hit since ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" while the 1996 feature romped to a 136 million domestic gross and 320.5 million internationally. New entry shouldnt end up too far off from those figures. Basic dynamic of this spotty dog tale once more pivots on fashion-plate Cruellas demented desire to create a unique Dalmatian-skin coat. When first seen however in an amusing opening gag Cruella is the lone human occupant of a Behavior Control Lab for animals where she has apparently been trained to adore the little pooches she once coveted for their special pelts. Told upon her release that she will forfeit her entire fortune if she ever lapses into her old ways Cruella reports to her probation officer Chloe (Alice Evans) a Dalmatian owner who becomes involved with the mild-mannered Kevin (Ioan Gruffudd) who operates a perilously underfunded animal rescue home called 2nd Chance. Like a fox magnanimously assuming responsibility for a henhouse the convicted dognapper underwrites the decrepit shelter and appoints it in her customary lavish style turning 2nd Chance into the poshest pound in Blighty. But oddly Big Bens bells suddenly make all of the labs rehabbed creatures revert to their former predatory selves and Cruella acting out the opposing extremes of her character as represented by her skunk-like black-and-white hairstyle goes on the rampage. Rededicating herself to evil she retrieves the dozens of fur coats she relegated to the basement and teams up with a loony French fashion designer Jean Pierre Le Pelt (a thatch-topped crazy-eyed Gerard Depardieu not in his finest hour) to kidnap the many Dalmatians that have now come under her purview and spirit them off to Paris to be transformed into haute couture. Lightweight frolicsome interludes are provided courtesy of Chloe and Kevins chaste courtship which is always accompanied by the playful romps of assorted doggies. A restaurant date between the shy humans is even intercut with their housebound hounds watching a video of the spaghetti-sharing scene in ""The Lady and the Tramp"" which will likely cause a spurt in sales for that Disney classic. The undoubted star among the new generation of pups is Oddball an all-white puppy that must have taxed the abilities of all of those spot removers. Also helpful is Waddlesworth a hyper-chatty green-winged macaw that thinks its a dog and is provided a lively voice by Eric Idle. Given the virtually identical setup to the original and similar action involving animal and human pursuit of purloined pups to a remote outpost its inevitable that the climax has a twice-baked flavor. Here and elsewhere director Kevin Lima making his live-action debut after scoring with Disneys animated ""Tarzan"" hits all the obvious notes hard and must be held to account for indulging so much hammy mugging from his cast particularly from Depardieu Tim McInnerny as Cruellas long-suffering valet and it must be said from Close herself who goes further over the top than before with a less helpful script and minus the surprise factor of the characters bold conceptualization. As the young romantic duo Evans and Gruffudd are blandly adequate substitutes for Joely Richardson and Jeff Daniels. Ace team of production designer Assheton Gorton costume designer Anthony Powell and cinematographer Adrian Biddle was reassembled by producer Edward S. Feldman (exec producer of ""101"") to lend valuable continuity to the new films look and the animal performances will more than charm the intended audience. 102 DalmatiansProductionA Buena Vista release of a Walt Disney Pictures presentation of an Edward S.
