Entertainment Theres No Room For ""Ant-Man"" In Marvels Big Plan The Marvel Cinematic Universe keeps getting bigger but Paul Rudds shrinking superhero shows that its forgotten how to scale down. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Marvel Studios/Disney Enterprises ID 6285204 Its become a rule that if youve got a gun hanging on the wall in the first act of your story then it ought to go off by the third. So it only follows that if youre going to include a shot of a model building in your movie about a shrinkable superhero then at some point the hero better end up inside or at least in front of it. Lets call it Chekhovs miniature When Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) having suited up to become Ant-Mans titular hero ends up dodging fire while scurrying across that tiny courtyard hes only fulfilling his small-scale destiny.Hes also taking part in a running joke that Ant-Man recounts like someone whos not entirely sure why the punchline is funny but whos committed to the telling anyway. The joke is that Ant-Man offers up the cinematic equivalent of ukulele covers of the overblown double-neck electric guitar solos that are the standard superhero flick. That scene is an intentionally rinky-dink version of the type of full-size architectural carnage included in every other Marvel movie. Captain America The Winter Soldier had a helicarrier slamming into S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters and Avengers Age of Ultron had a city being hoisted into the air as a weapon. But Ant-Man? Ant-Man wrecks a model building and a Thomas the Tank Engine train set. View this image > Marvel Studios/Disney Enterprises ID 6285239 Ant-Man doesnt aim to make fun of superhero tropes but in its best bits most of which involve the action sequences that make up its final section it attempts to partake in them while gently deflating all that continuity-based grandiosity. The reigning blockbuster genre is after all built around the idea of bigness. Franchises are driven by the principle of eternal expansion of new characters always being added and new villains always looming a few installments down the line promising ever-worse disasters and ready to engage in greater battles each time.The hero of Ant-Man isnt just literally small engaging in pint-size set pieces and riding insects hes thematically minimized as well an admittedly expendable protagonist who gets swept up in someone elses battle of good and evil but whos really just hoping to get visitation rights with his daughter. Theres even a whole storyline about how hes brought in to take the rightful place of the resentful better-qualified Hope (Evangeline Lilly) a plot point that manages to apologize for the lack of female-led Marvel movies so far without actually providing one.The problem the movie runs into is that it or rather the Marvel Cinematic Universe needs Ant-Man to be a real superhero as well as a pastiche of one. Rudd whose eternally boyish likability isnt quite a substitute for Scotts lack of a clear personality is signed on for multiple movies and is already set to make an appearance in Captain America Civil War. His characters story is bookended with two bits of MCU tie-in opening with a ponderous 80s flashback involving Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas digitally rejuvenated for the scene) and Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell aged up) and closing with an after-credits stinger that underlines how tonally different the next MCU installment will be from the one we just watched. View this image > Zade Rosenthal Marvel Studios/Disney Enterprises ID 6285252 No other Marvel installment has felt as weighed down by its obligations to the franchise -- even the arrival of Anthony Mackie as the Falcon mostly an excuse for an entertainingly choreographed fight sequence is so unnecessary to the main story that its hard to remember what justification was forced into the plot to make it happen.Ant-Man is a hilariously uncool character -- his powers are becoming tiny and controlling ants which suddenly makes being a really good archer look pretty sweet. The uncool factor is you have to imagine part of what drew Edgar Wright and writing partner Joe Cornish to the character over a decade ago when they were pitching a project based around him to Artisan and then Marvel. Wright maker of wittily wonderful pop culture-soaked movies like Hot Fuzz and The Worlds End was initially set to direct Ant-Man but made a high-profile exit before it went into production last year. He was replaced by Peyton Reed (The Break-Up Yes Man).While its unfair to fault Ant-Man for not being an Edgar Wright project Wright who still shares a writing credit has left behind so many distinctive touches that you can see the ghost outlines of the movie he never made one thats fondly familiar with the ins and outs of superherodom but thats just as much about the redemption of a well-meaning ex-con. Reed is an adequate director but cant get the timing right on scenes like the first one to present Scott a prison-movie gag that doesnt snap crisply enough to its reveal. And a sequence in which Scott and similarly shrinkable villain Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) accidentally trigger a song on an iPhone while fighting inside a suitcase should be funny and grand at the same time and instead is just a throwaway bit. View this image > Marvel Studios/Disney Enterprises ID 6285311 Ant-Mans shrinkage issues are really Marvels -- theres apparently no room for scaling down in the companys big plan and unhappily little to no room for films that feel more like the work of a particular director than like a part of the larger cinematic universe. Theres nothing event movie-worthy about Ant-Man on the page which is part of his charm and yet Ant-Man gamely strives to be an event movie anyway. Scott Langs dwarfed by the giant stage on which hes placed but these days that seems to be the only kind of stage there is.

Comments (3) Ant-Man Video Rated PG-13  117 minutes  2015 At long last Marvel Studios offers up a superhero smaller than its artistic ambitions. Paul Rudd stars as an ex-con recruited by scientist Michael Douglas to test a high-tech suit that reduces Rudd to the size of an insect; why this would be an asset isnt clear--when its me versus an ant I almost always win--but thats OK because Rudds nemesis is another guy whos stolen the technology. Edgar Wright the offscreen collaborator of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead Hot Fuzz The Worlds End) contributed to the screenplay and Rudd applies his usual light touch to the snarky moments; these mix uneasily with the dramatic scenes which are so phony you wonder why anyone even bothered. I enjoyed the scenes in which Rudd first tries to function in a world of giant household objects but only because they reminded me of The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957).

"Ant-Man - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Ant-Man Posted by Christy Lemire on July 22 2015 1 Comment Walt Disney Pictures Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence. Running time 115 minutes. Three stars out of four. The end of the world isnt nigh for once in ""Ant-Man."" Sure there are stakes. This is a summer blockbuster after all. It has to make us care about something of consequence. But the overwhelming self-serious sense that we are watching something Very Important blissfully doesnt exist in ""Ant-Man."" Its just plain fun light breezy simple and enjoyable. Aside from the original ""Iron Man"" from 2008 which had the benefit of Robert Downey Jr. cracking wise in the title role for the first time this is the most purely entertaining film yet from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Its especially a joy to watch just a couple months after ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" which was overloaded with characters subplots bad guys and twists. And yet director Peyton Reeds film based on a script by a whole buncha people (including Edgar Wright who initially was set to direct and the films star Paul Rudd) repeatedly reminds you that it is part of a larger Marvel world. The in-jokes and cameos from other characters and stories are amusing if you get them but if you dont theyre not so prevalent or cutesy as to be off-putting. However meager ""Ant-Man"" may seem it definitely functions as the glue between Marvel movies weve seen already seen and ones to come. Everything is of a piece within the MCU  of course -- hence the tricky little teasers that come during the closing credits which compel us to stay in our seats for a few moments longer rather than dashing off to the bathroom. As the diminutive comic-book hero of the films title Rudd is his usual likable everyman but hes also charming enough to figure his way in and out of every situation. Hes not as flat-out funny per se as he has been traditionally in movies like ""I Love You Man"" or ""Knocked Up"" but thats also not exactly his purpose here. This is a heist movie. He is a master thief -- but a boyishly handsome and decent-hearted one. My good friend and What the Flick? co-host Alonso Duralde suggested when we reviewed ""Ant-Man"" on the show that Rudds charisma is drained here as much as Chris Pratts is in ""Jurassic World."" Id say its not that bad. Its just a different vibe from him lower-key but no less sharp. When we first see Rudds Scott Lang hes being released from San Quentin State Prison (with a memorable send-off from his fellow inmates). Hes spent time behind bars for an elaborate and high-tech theft; now hes struggling to rebuild his life in San Francisco and prove to his ex-wife (Judy Greer in yet another thankless mom role) and young daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson) that he can be a reliable force for good in their lives. The job he ends up taking though is one he never possibly could have expected. The brilliant professor Hank Pym (a touching and wise Michael Douglas whom we first see as an uncanny 1989 version of himself) wants Scott to break into his former headquarters and steal the magical shrinking serum he created to keep it from falling into the wrong hands namely those of his protege (an oily Corey Stoll) who once was full of promise but now is a greedy megalomaniac. You know the usual. The heist requires Scott to wear the sleek and mercilessly snug suit and helmet Hank created and once wore himself long ago which makes the inhabitant instantly tiny with the press of a button. Hank recruits Scott to get in the suit get small get in and get out. But Hanks daughter the equally brilliant Hope (Evangeline Lilly) also wants a chance to prove she can be the ant and is willing to fight Scott physically for the right to climb inside the costume. Lilly gets to do little more here than spar disapprovingly with Rudd while wearing crisp suits and a sharp bob and any kind of romantic connection the two characters might have is tenuous at best. But -- spoiler kinda -- there is the suggestion that more is in store for Hope in the near future. While the montages are amusing as Scott masters the art of size-shifting with hit-and-miss results the action sequences have a real zest and visual panache once he learns to work side by side with the various other high-tech ants Hank has trained. And once he really gets the hang of manipulating the suit and kicking all kinds of pint-size ass his thrills are infectious. Reed might seem like an incredibly odd choice to direct an effects-laden summer blockbuster based on his filmography -- ""Bring It On"" ""Down With Love"" ""The Break-Up"" -- but hes got a solid script to work from and he gets the pacing and comic timing just right. His staging of the films first actual break-in -- at Hanks house actually -- offers a clever bit of clockwork precision and several sight gags provide scattered laughs throughout. As part of the random supporting cast -- which includes John Slattery Bobby Cannavale and T.I. -- the always-reliable Michael Pena co-stars as the friend who picks Scott up from prison and gives him a place to stay in the city. He may seem at first like an offensive Hispanic stereotype but some slyly edited flashbacks reveal his cultured tastes and flesh him out. His character is a great example of what makes ""Ant-Man"" work so well You may think you know where its going but it keeps surprising you in ways both big and small.

By Anthony Lane Paul Rudd plays an unlikely superhero in a movie directed by Peyton Reed.   Credit Illustration by Matt Taylor Some enterprising scholar should compile an antology of film. The starting point would be the crowd of ants in Bunuels ""Un Chien Andalou"" (1929) pouring forth from a hole in a human palm an image provoked by a dream of Salvador Dalis. Pride of place would go to ""Them"" the mysterious 1954 movie about ants in New Mexico that grow as huge as horses after a nuclear test; the stridulation of unseen creatures in the desert makes music--a high wavering whistle--that you cannot wipe from your mind. Then comes ""Phase IV"" (1974) directed by Saul Bass who keeps his ants small although their capacity for global takeover we learn is immense. Merriest of all is a made-up film ""Mant"" the horror flick at the heart of Joe Dantes ""Matinee"" (1993) which is launched by a bumptious producer in the midst of the Cuban missile crisis bearing the magnificent tagline ""Half Man Half Ant All Terror"" So where does ""Ant-Man"" the latest item to roll off the Marvel assembly line fit in that distinguished list? Well there are plenty of ants around but their sole task is to provide tactical support to Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) a thief with a masters degree in electrical engineering. Scott is taken up by Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) a reclusive scientist with a high-tech company to his name and invited to wear a special suit--even more special it would seem than Iron Mans. (When fans talk about the Marvel universe what they really mean is the Marvel wardrobe. You could hang all the characters on one costume rack.) Thus clad Scott presses a button and is instantly diminished to the size of an insect. The first time he does so he is caught up in a cavalcade of perils swept toward a bathtub drain roared at by a rat swallowed by the maw of a vacuum cleaner and dropped onto a revolving LP where in the deepest sense he gets into the groove. That is fun to behold but it hardly breaks new ground. Behind Scott lies another Scott the hero of ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (1957) who began to dwindle after passing through a radioactive cloud. (How much did B movies owe to the A-bomb?) He dwindled gradually however as if to demonstrate that bourgeois existence could grind you down whereas the new shrinker can pop back to regular proportions as and when he desires. That ability is far less socially suggestive and its deployed for the dreariest of reasons allowing our hero to vanish to a speck and then to reappear in mid-combat. Its a knack that serves him well when he has to break into the headquarters of Pyms organization now under the wicked thumb of Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) who has developed his own suit which--wait for it--allows him to turn into a yellow jacket. Game on. Until the eleventh hour the movie was set to be directed by Edgar Wright the maker of ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" and you can spot the skid marks of those works in ""Ant-Man"" especially in the whooshing sound of the flashbacks. But Wright though he retains a screenplay credit along with Joe Cornish Adam McKay and Rudd relinquished command of the film to Peyton Reed. Whether Reed is remotely concerned with the whiz-bang demands of the Marvel formula is open to question and he wrings more laughs from one scene at a Baskin-Robbins than from the entire saga of the Pym corporation with its gleaming labs. Also despite Reeds relish for romantic jinks (he created such confections as ""Down with Love"") he cant do much with the bonding of Scott and Pyms daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) who has a withering glance a black bob and not much else. You wait for her to emerge from her chrysalis as a femme fatale but it never comes to pass just as you long for Michael Douglas to stop being kindly and sage and dredge up his inner Gekko. What if anything holds ""Ant-Man"" together? First Paul Rudd who is laughably unheroic and has the grace to know as much; that knowledge is part of his charm although the poor fellow still has to utter lines like ""I think our first move should be calling the Avengers."" Half comedy Half sci-fi All nonsense Then there is Thomas the Tank Engine who gives the most thoughtful performance in the movie. He is part of a train set in the bedroom of Scotts young daughter and as such he is perfectly adapted to the dimensions of Ant-Mans world. There is an unmistakable sense of release at the finale as Reed brushes aside the bulk of the plot and replaces it with as many gags as possible. Some of them involve Thomas and one of them the most audacious involves a table-tennis paddle--a single forehand swipe of which we suddenly realize can swat or flatten any human who has summoned the courage to assume an insect form. Late in the day ""Ant-Man"" starts to toy with the squashable frailty of its protagonist and to play it off against the masterful powers that we associate with a superhero. So many men cast themselves as big shots and we should welcome anything--a magic suit or a good joke--that cuts them down to size. It would be wrong to call Joshua Oppenheimers ""The Look of Silence"" a sequel to his previous film ""The Act of Killing"" (2012). Rather the two movies comprise a documentary diptych on a single theme the butchering of hundreds of thousands of people--Communists and those accused of sympathizing with them and ethnic Chinese--in Indonesia in the mid-nineteen-sixties. Oppenheimer puts the number as high as a million but he also realizes that beyond a certain point the scale of any massacre makes it hard to grasp; the larger the crime the more it risks a loss of dramatic pressure in the telling. His solution in the new film is to follow the quest of one Indonesian man. Adi is an optometrist; he has a wife and children and his parents are still alive but there is a gap in the family. In 1965 some two years before he was born his elder brother Ramli perished at the hands of his countrymen and Adi now makes it his mission to hear for himself the distressing details of when where and precisely how his brother died. One can think of many action movies in which the slaying of a relative sparks a violent payback but ""The Look of Silence"" holds no such brief. It is an inaction film and Adi in line with his profession does not deal in an eye for an eye. If anything he stays preternaturally calm while he tours the local district offering vision tests to various old men most of whom are implicated in Ramlis demise and are all too keen to talk. Take Inong who keeps a monkey on a leash. His temper is still hot and his memory fresh. ""If we didnt drink blood wed go crazy"" he says recalling how his victims were vampirized and adding in the tone of a connoisseur ""Human blood is salty and sweet."" Inong led the death squad in the village where he continues to dwell and where his deeds command respect. ""Everything is safe now"" he tells Adi and chides him for raising the spectre of unpleasantness ""Youre talking politics again."" There is a wry satisfaction to be gained from ""The Look of Silence"" as it assembles a catalogue of all the excuses and dismissals with which the guilty now as ever slough off their sins ""What could we do? It was a revolution""; ""Better just to follow orders""; ""Forget the past lets all get along"" and so forth. Yet the movie does something more unusual. It jabs at our Whiggish self-consoling--the natural assumption that we live and learn that we are better for the learning and that history once comprehended will not repeat itself. Try telling that to the former leader of an anti-Communist paramilitary group now the Speaker of a regional legislature who listens politely to Adis recital of wrongdoing and announces ""If you make an issue of it it will happen again."" That sounds to me like a threat. Live and learn by all means but remember you could also learn and die. ""The Look of Silence"" is a simpler work than ""The Act of Killing"" and a better one. The earlier film had a complicated trick to play murderers were encouraged often with props such as fake flesh and gore to assume the role of those who had suffered at their hands. The results were startling but is the gruesomeness in the new movie any less arresting for being recounted rather than replayed? (""If you chop from behind theres no noise"" one man confides.) The mood is one of tense tranquillity thanks to Adis stoical insistence on paying homage to his brother and his conversations always difficult are set against more placid sights the bat-filled blue of an evening sky or Adis mother washing his father--a withered stick figure who may or may not recall his vanished child. There is a hint of ritual in these ablution scenes and a note of classical justice in the mothers verdict on the evildoers ""In the afterlife their victims will take revenge."" Whats unnerving is not how rare that ancient sentiment sounds in a documentary but how badly you want it to be true.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Eleventh-century Nordic god reimagined as hunky extraterrestrial? Sure. World War II pulp hero defrosted in the 21st century? Why not? When last summers Guardians of the Galaxy pulled off the ridiculous twofer of a talking raccoon and an ambulatory houseplant it officially felt like Marvel Studios might be incapable of failure.Related Story Marvels Increasingly Ludicrous (and Exciting and Diverse) Plans With Ant-Man however Marvel seems finally to have met its match. The premise--a superhero who can make himself tiny and talk to ants--was tricky enough to begin with. But the picture appears ultimately to have been undone less by premise than by process.Ant-Man isnt a bad movie so much as a highly uneven one one that manages the principal tiny-hero challenge adequately--there are echoes throughout of every shrinking movie ever made--but stumbles in small ways with regularity. It will come as a surprise to no one whos ever watched Paul Rudd that the star displays his customary low-key charm in the role of Scott Lang the well-meaning burglar who is unexpectedly recruited into Ant-Manhood. Michael Douglas is likewise solid as Hank Pym the aging scientist who invented and formerly wore the Ant-Man costume. And the rest of the cast (including Evangeline Lilly Corey Stoll Bobby Canavale and Michael Pena) generally hit their marks as well.The basic plot too is eminently manageable. As it did last year (with Captain America Winter Soldier and Guardians) Marvel has again opted to follow up a big universe-advancing epic (this years was Avengers Age of Ultron) with something lighter in tone and more peripheral to its fate-of-the-Earth megaplots. In an effort to raise money to pay his daughters child support ex-con Lang is persuaded to engage in One Last Heist. But the heist it turns out was merely a test engineered by Pym who needs a new Ant-Man to infiltrate his old company whose current CEO (Stoller) is about to unleash global chaos by beginning production of his own shrinking-soldier costume the Yellowjacket. (One can envision the ensuing arms race the Stink Bug the Hookworm the Chigger...)If that all sounds rather silly well its supposed to. At its best--and with a substantial assist from Rudd--Ant-Man embraces this inherent silliness with gusto. (Again The protagonist zips around on a flying ant hes named ""Antony."") But the tone of the movie varies substantially from scene to scene (theres much unnecessarily overwrought father-daughter melodrama) substantial gaps in logic abound and the whole ultimately amounts to less than the sum of its parts. Its difficult to shake the sense that the film was assembled hurriedly and somewhat haphazardly.At its best--with a substantial assist from Rudd--Ant-Man embraces its inherent silliness with gusto. Which from all available evidence is exactly what happened. Edgar Wright the action-comedy virtuoso responsible for Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz was pegged as the films writer-director all the way back in 2006. And he remained in that role through multiple delays and rewrites until May of last year when he abruptly announced he was pulling out over creative differences with the studio. (Yes yes I understand that Marvel has a brand and a continuity to maintain. But what I would give to see Wrights Ant-Man.) Adam McKay (Anchorman Talladega Nights) briefly entered negotiations to take over before deciding against it and in June just 13 months ago Peyton Reed was announced as the new director with McKay and Rudd reworking the script. (Reed Lilly and Stoll also contributed ideas.) The sensible move under the circumstances would almost certainly have been to delay the films release. But as we know the unfolding Marvelverse has a schedule to keep.And so we have Ant-Man exactly the kind of movie one might anticipate such a process yielding. The script bears all the earmarks of last-minute tinkering by multiple hands and the emergency director Reed--who began his career promisingly with Bring It On and the underrated war-of-the-sexes confection Down with Love before backsliding into such lazy fare as The Break-Up and Yes Man--is not up to the task of tying it all together into a satisfying whole.Ant-Man is by no means a complete failure and Marvel aficionados who keep their expectations in check will find plenty to like including an appearance by one erstwhile Avenger. But the movie is well below par for the studio. It presents Marvel with the lesson that Burnss admonition about the ""best-laid schemes o mice an men"" should perhaps be extended to ants as well.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters How Chelsea Beat Ivanka at Being a Candidate Daughter Michelle Cottle The comparatively less flashy less spirited former First Kid managed to show her moms softer side at the DNC on Thursday. Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings."" Continue Reading Reuters Trump Time Capsule 63 Whats In the Tax Returns? James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

"Chastened Amy Trainwreck Fails Its Breakout Star; Also the Pleasantly Surprising Ant-Man << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Chastened Amy Trainwreck Fails Its Breakout Star; Also the Pleasantly Surprising Ant-Man Universal Pictures Movies July 17 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Amy Schumer seems like a milkmaid in a Mel Brooks movie or on Benny Hill. So whenever she goes to churn butter shell always do it as though shes actually making something else. But her comedy is beyond simulation. It deals with the thing being simulated blowjobs anal sex and all the rest. The title of her Comedy Central show gets right to the point Inside Amy Schumer. On it shes the funniest neurotic in America. The neurosis hails from no pure comedy tradition. All the worry is happy or drunken; the insecurities are so ingrained that they register in reverse as narcissism. Over three seasons the show has tightened and thought its way to brilliance. It goes after the social double standards of sex and gender at work in relationships and in the culture and it satirizes the damage men and women do to each other and to themselves. Even when a sketch is as obvious as one from the end of Season 2 in which Schumer spends a day obsessively grooming herself for a date while being bombarded with enticements for further weirder grooming its funny because the idea takes the express train to lunacy with her looking hot but cowering in terror under her bed. The show works because we know where Schumers coming from. Now shes the star of Trainwreck a Judd Apatow-directed romantic comedy she wrote and I have no idea where its coming from. The title seems like a designation more for the film than for the promiscuous partier Schumer plays. Its got no rhythm or reliable comfort zone. The jokes and ensemble scenes are all rushed so you cant savor them or what anyone in them is doing. Schumers character Amy Townsend writes for SNuff a Manhattan-based lad mag overseen by Dianna a skinny spray-tanned Tilda Swinton snidely answering the unasked question What if Toni Collette were made of dried apricots? The first staff meeting comes early in the film and you know youre in trouble because no one seems to know what the joke is. Diannas hunt for story pitches (the staff includes Schumer Vanessa Bayer Randall Park and Jon Glaser) also feels like a hunt for gags. (""You Call Those Tits?"" is one potential feature.) Swinton bites down on the part but the sequence is full of reaction shots so you can never quite take in the joke her face and body language are telling. This is to say that Apatow is looking for comedy in the wrong spots. Or maybe he was saving Swinton from herself. Either way its a flat scene but its not the only one. Amy leaves the meeting with an assignment Shell profile Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) knee surgeon to the stars. His clientele consists mostly of sports legends shes never heard of. As she enters Aarons office LeBron James is exiting and she doesnt know who he is. Maybe this is supposed to make her story better because either her ignorance will be upended or her skepticism could unearth some journalistic surprise but the whole thing is just a setup for an unethical unconvincing romance. You keep looking for Aaron to notice some sparkle in Amy that allows him to proceed. But its just the script obeying a diagram. As a character Amys a mess -- not in the way ""train wreck"" would imply just as a conception. Shes narcissistic caustic tantrum-prone rarely sober and situationally ignorant -- and not only about sports (she thinks its ""Doctors With Borders""). Loosely shes a bigot too. When Aaron asks her to produce a photo of a black friend she sheepishly shows him one of herself a friend and their waiter. Schumers mix of delusional certitude and chagrin is actually funny. But after enough of these scenes youre asking yourself who is this woman and what is it Schumer is trying to say with her? If the character doesnt work then neither can the movie. Its got a good opening scene thats set during Amys girlhood in which she and her sister listen as their father (Colin Quinn) explains why their mother is kicking him out of the house. He compares marriage to being stuck for life with the same doll and implores them to repeat ""Monogamy isnt realistic."" Theres a cut forward 23 years when Amy is drunkenly bedding impossibly endowed strangers; discovering in horror that she has awakened in Staten Island; and taking mincing high-heeled steps along a walk of shame that culminates in a humiliated/triumphal stretch on the deck of the Staten Island ferry. She does all of this while holding down a he-man boyfriend named Steven (John Cena) who wants more from Amy than she knows how to give. Cena isnt bad in his handful of scenes. But even the small parts suffer from being overconceived and underwritten. Steven wants monogamy with Amy but he also seems gay. And the movie doesnt see any of those possibilities through either. In bed one night Amy asks Steven to talk during sex and the best he can do is stuff like ""Im gonna fill you with my protein."" Is he actually closeted gay for himself or just lousy in bed? The gay boyfriend is a relatable worry in Schumers comedy that rarely ends in belly laughs but always provides some insight into her paranoid distrust. In popular culture men dreaming of having a gay girlfriend is a cliche. In Schumers world (and frankly beyond it) having a gay boyfriend is something women dread and the depiction of that dread is rare in mainstream culture. But the movie shares Amys preemptive promiscuity. Its always on to the next thing to keep from dealing with the matter at hand. That opening scene with Quinn and the little daughters turns sour once you realize an hour later that he wasnt delivering a thesis. He was riffing. There is something psychological under the surface of this movie something about sex and a fear of monogamy but the movie isnt exploring that. It just stays busy. Amy and her sister Kim (Brie Larson) make numerous nursing-home visits to see Quinn as he spews something crude or racist or insulting. (The movie has literalized his on-set curmudgeon routine.) Amy insults Kims bland doughy husband (Mike Birbiglia) and is freaked out by his precocious son (Evan Brinkman). (Theres a very funny moment at one of Manhattans Alice in Wonderland theme cafes when Amy gets a load of her brother-in-law and the kid beaming at each other and says ""Theyre like on a speed date."") Because things are so thin on Amys end the movie tries to give Aaron some of the action but it just confuses everything more. His scenes without Amy are excuses to showcase access to LeBron James who along with Cena feels more substantial than anyone here but who even as himself has nothing to do but butler and chauffeur Amy and Aarons relationship into existence. The filmmakers dont appear to think much of him. He gets to go one-on-one with Hader on a basketball court and earnestly recite the lyrics to ""Gold Digger."" (Method Man has a more embarrassingly thankless part as Quinns Caribbean orderly.) Hader doesnt play Aaron as LeBrons friend per se but as a tolerant acquaintance of Jamess cute confidence. Hader might be the best natural actor of all of the longtime Saturday Night Live cast members and you can feel him building a character here. But I didnt leave Trainwreck with a sense of who that character is. Instead of reducing Amys obnoxiousness it punches his up like in a restaurant scene in which he asks for the check by shouting for it. I laughed because Im helpless against an antic Hader but its a nonsensical quirk for this guy to have. The entire film proceeds from that kind of nonsense. At some point LeBron stages a love intervention on Aarons behalf. James sits alongside Chris Evert and Matthew Broderick while Marv Albert does play-by-play and its impossible to overstate the degree to which this sequence isnt funny. Its like watching five people die in a fire except the culprit is limp comedy instead of arson. Evert looks mortified before she has even said her one vulgar line. It seems as if theyve all been force-fed their dialogue and only some of them know its poison. In a scene like this you dont know where Schumers reality-check comedy ends and Apatows adolescent fantasies begin. Apatow just put out a collection of interviews with comedians that hes been conducting since he was a kid. Its called Sick in the Head and its a fun enlightened book whose insights come from conversations guided by Apatows wonder and respect and awe but also from his genuine human curiosity -- all of which were on display in The 40-Year-Old Virgin but gradually have been seeping out. Its been replaced by stubbornness and incuriosity. Now theres a banal certitude to his movies. This is how the world works -- like how the movies say it does. Apatow has been surpassed by his friend Paul Feig a writer and director of film comedies1 who doesnt have to hunt for a joke. He has the assurance and preparation to build a scene -- and often a single shot -- around a guaranteed laugh. In the book Apatow confesses to having wanted to work with Schumer since he heard her on Howard Sterns radio show. Her sense of freshness drew him to her. It made him want to direct her. With Trainwreck Im not sure he has. The wildness he perceived and the sense of not giving a fuck really works on her television show. Thats the kind of feminism that powers it -- the self-conscious performance of unself-consciousness of exploring what it means for women to behave socially like men. Where then are the lines of propriety and who defines where those lines go? The sketches are brief barbed and all point to a big idea about women sexuality and personality. A particular sketch can be a mess but by the third season the ideas unify and they sting. Most of Trainwreck is sketchy too but in the manner of a random mistaken assembly of an outtake reel. Throughout we get glimpses of a lame black-and-white romantic comedy that stars Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei and its there to remind you that things could always have been worse. The film feels like something that Schumer might have written or wanted to write years ago when she was still searching for a persona. But the thing is Schumer doesnt have one. She has many and the virtue of a sketch show is that you can discard them once theyve served a purpose. But she and Apatow dont appear to be interested in sustaining an actual woman in an actual romantic comedy and if youre Parker Posey or even Drew Barrymore that kind of daffy caricature can get you through a 90- or 100-minute movie. This one lasts for more than two hours and never once is there a moment in which Schumer makes a case for stardom the way she does on her show. She could be a new improved Bette Midler. You get the sense that shes trying to reintroduce the psychological wackiness that Midler eventually forsook in order to do heavenward schmaltz. Its not just sexism and self-hate that Schumer wants to bring down its cute half-assed romantic fantasies. But Trainwreck turns out to be too much of that kind of fantasy. The milkmaid isnt that filthy after all. She actually is just making butter.  Marvel Entertainment Sometimes you get to a movie ready to walk right out. Theres an air of inevitability thats a turnoff. It doesnt even need an audience to be a hit. It could pay to watch itself. Some superhero movies and film series are that way. But not Ant-Man. This is the sort of movie where you see the effort and say Thank god. Its good sloshy fun with the exact right proportions. The hero (Paul Rudd) has a personality. The villain (Corey Stoll) is loathsome without being over-the-top about it. The supporting black and Latino characters are stereotypes but played by energetic charismatic actors (T.I. and Michael Pena). And theres a bite-size perfectly basic caper plot and effects and art design that feel sprung from dreams. Some of my initial resistance to Ant-Man had to do with the movies troubled provenance. Its a Marvel title that Peyton Reed stepped in to direct after the departure of Edgar Wright who keeps a writing credit. When a solid but nondescript director replaces a stylish one you fear blandness. But this movie has a real personality. Rudd plays Scott Lang a professional thief in San Francisco who winds up helping old affluent scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) prevent his protege Darren Cross (Stoll) from doing terrible things with a special suit that allows the wearer to shrink down to a bug-size super-soldier. Pym has a suit of his own which he gives to Lang. With the help of Pyms envious daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly who in a pageboy doesnt look a day over Barbara Hershey) Pym trains Lang to break into his lab which Cross controls and dismantle the new suit. And that is mercifully that. But a lot happens often with ingenuity. Pena plays an ex-con and Langs roommate and he gets a couple of terrific ""my cousin told me"" montages to narrate in which different Latino characters make gossipy plot advancements while lip-syncing to Penas voice. Its like a memory of a music video. What big superhero movie would have either the patience or awareness of a world outside its own for witty sequences like those? You see the backyard parties and the swagger everybodys got and its as if somebodys thrown open a window. It works so well that you even table for another day the problem of Marvels ongoing marginalization of non-white characters. Once Ant-Man harnesses the suit he winds up at a surprise location where Anthony Mackie as Falcon appears in what is basically a security guard job. Nonetheless life around a movie is still life. Or at least thats what I told myself this time. Rudd has at last reeled himself back from the embitterment and smugness hed taken on since he started working with Judd Apatow. He seems youthful and trim and happy to be here. So does Douglas who gets to do more than be old and wise. His comic version of disgust is a new look. These were never crucial Marvel characters but the movies update of the mythology and simultaneous tribute to the history the company has built count as acts of love.2 Theres a plot about Lang trying to get back into the good graces of his young daughter thats pretty hoary. But it lets Bobby Cannavale and Judy Greer -- far more him than her -- in on some of the fun and leads the movies finale which involves action sequences set amid the daughters toys. Some of the kick comes from the pleasure the filmmakers have with size and perception and physics turning running bathwater into a tsunami and ants into Godzillas. The timing on Dan Lebental and Colby Parker Jr.s editing from Langs shrunken perspective to ours results in some of the years best visual comedy. And the 3-D is the best most committed use of the format since the last Jackass movie. Who knows what Wrights artistry would have made of this? But Reed and his crew do just fine. Its annoying to think that the Marvel tractor beam is just going to suck up all of these good well-delineated characters.

Oh why be mean? Because its the middle of summer and kids are out of school and in its medium-stupid and mismanaged fashion its not so awful. Ant-Man is a character other silly people in the Marvel universe make fun of -- was that hurtful? Im so sorry -- and this movie cannot quite decide what it wants to be in the unlikely event that it grows up.Until recently ""Ant-Man"" was going to be a self-referential spoof directed by Edgar Wright of ""Shaun of the Dead"" fame and some of that DNA is still in there. Wright and ""Attack the Block"" director Joe Cornish are among the four credited writers but at some point star Paul Rudd and ""Anchorman"" director Adam McKay got in on the action too. Rudd plays Scott Lang the cheerful lowlife who is transformed into Ant-Man by the power of Michael Douglas shellacked hair and Clinton administration eyewear. Anyway the movie was directed in the end by a person called Peyton Reed one of those longtime Hollywood comedy people who isnt good enough to be memorable or bad enough to be mockable. It largely resembles -- no largely is an elaborate CGI action cartoon with giant ants (mostly friendly) and a giant Thomas the Tank Engine (super scary) bookended by a pleasant but inconsequential Paul Rudd indie comedy that cost 75 million or whatever it was.Michael Pena should probably sue everyone in Hollywood for making him play a stereotypical Latino gangbanger although the character is admittedly really funny and has a taste for white wine and modern art and Pena is one of those actors whos always fun in anything. Judy Greer another always-fun actor should definitely sue everyone in Hollywood for yet another role in which she stands around looking chipper and gets nothing to do. But they both seem like nice people and anyway they cashed the checks so they wont be doing that. You Might Also Like Partway through its ""Honey I Shrunk the Burglar"" plotline ""Ant-Man"" turns into yet another cinematic riff on the mind-altering reality-shifting visual journey pioneered by Stanley Kubrick in ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" No see you think Im still being facetious but Im totally not. Reed attempts after his own antlike fashion to follow in the tripped-out footsteps of Christopher Nolans ""Interstellar"" Gaspar Noes ""Enter the Void"" and Luc Bessons ""Lucy"" just to name a super-mixed bag of examples. After he goes down a bathtub drain and gets sucked into a vacuum bag and surfs the grooves of an LP on a DJs turntable and evades the platform shoes of hot young disco dancers Rudds micro-hero gets so tiny he enters the realm of quantum physics where the laws of space and time no longer apply and your personal identity vanishes into kaleidoscopic triangles floating through a loaf of moldy bread. Is it the ultimate nature of reality or the inside of Donald Trumps brain?Breathe Ant-Man Drink some water. You took a powerful drug or to put it another way you are a character in a discombobulated summer movie thats kind of fun but doesnt have nearly enough story to fill up two hours. God is here looking disconcertingly like Michael Douglas and he loves you in his special sourpuss way. It will all be over soon after about eight seconds of rushed denouement. Then we get one post-credits stinger scene alluding to the endless future of yet more Marvel movies -- and then we get another one (which I didnt understand at all). And then we all get to go home only a little smaller than we were before. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Whether this is good news or bad may depend on how you feel about American pop cultures perpetual adolescence. Is it for instance a sign of a national Peter Pan (er Peter Parker) syndrome? Or is it an illuminating glimpse into our never-waning-but-all-over-the-map wish to save the world and to be saved to be invincible even as were vulnerable to be compassionate and get paid well? If these sort of considerations annoy the heck out of you when applied to escapist fare I get it. And so this review wont hold ""Ant-Man"" under a magnifying glass. At least not for too long. I come not to inspect or fry this months Marvel offering but to praise it as just pretty darn fun. Written by the movies initial director Edgar Wright before he left the project and doctored mightily by Adam McKay and star Paul Rudd ""Ant-Man"" itself plays with themes of dads and daughters mentors and proteges visionary tinkering and exploited research. Paul Rudd portrays burglar Scott Lang who has a heart (and conscience it seems) of gold. Released from prison he intends to be on the straight and narrow. Ex-wife Maggie (Judy Greer) and her cop fiance Paxton (Bobby Cannavale) wont let him spend time with daughter Cassie otherwise. But its hard out there for a thief as a scene in Baskin Robbins attests. And friend and onetime cellmate Luis (Michael Pena all dopey puppy-dog charm) has plans. So too does Dr. Hank Pym. The brilliant researcher and ousted head of his own company -- Pym Technologies -- knows protege Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) is nearing a weaponized application of the Pym Particle -- which can shrink a person while making them stronger. What Cross doesnt yet have is the Ant-Man suit. That good-looking get-up will soon belong to Scott. As is the habit with the ever expanding Marvel Universe ""Ant-Man"" contains plenty of nods to other franchise stars. For fans there are mentions of S.H.I.E.L.D. Tony Stark/Iron Man Captain America and the Avengers as a whole. Pyms Ant-Man alter-ego made his first appearance on the page in 1962 as one of the founding Avengers. Michael Douglas portrays Pym and the movie opens in 1989 with a incensed Pym refusing to allow his research to be used as a weapon. A computer-tweaked version of the star makes him look an awful lot like one of his more iconic characters Gordon Gekko of ""Wall Street."" Only Pym makes it clear to his business partners that greeds not so good. Evangeline Lilly plays Pyms daughter and Pym Technologies higher-up Hope van Dyne. Shes estranged but not so much that she doesnt see Cross dark designs. Lilly has underestimated fun as Pyms resentful utterly capable offspring. Although its hard to tell if the filmmakers intentionally gave her a wig that makes her look like Catherine Zeta-Jones circa ""Chicago."" That joke would be too weird. The cast is better than solid. Directed by Peyton Reed the action is a zippy pleasure. The more Scott shrinks the bigger the fun. The visual effects are witty especially when he begins making allies of various ant colonies. Rudd plays to his strengths here. Lang is a rather sensitive fella. But the role of kinder-gentler wry guy hero and that groovy super-power suit fit him to a T.

Photo Zade Rosenthal/Marvel/Disney The best thing about Marvels Ant-Man is that despite a computer-effects team larger than the population of Scandinavia it plays like a charmingly tacky jet-suit robot picture for kids the kind Japan used to churn out every week for a couple of thousand yen. It doesnt have that familiar Marvel bloat. The key is that instead of everything getting gargantuan the hero (Paul Rudd) shrinks down to the size of an insect and rides on the backs of ants and other wee winged creatures that look laughably fake. But who cares if the storytelling is smart? Related Stories Ant-Man Works Almost Too Well As a a50s Horror B-Movie A Timeline of Ant-Manas Troubled Production History [Updated] Its smart-ish anyway. Rudd plays Scott Lang a San Francisco hacker who went to prison for pulling a Robin Hood on a corrupt corporation and now wants only to spend time with his little daughter. (Yes this is another absent-father-and-daughter story.) Flirting with a life of crime Scott is suddenly recruited by a scientist mogul played by a gray-bearded Michael Douglas to help him stop his ex-protege bald Corey Stoll from helping to create an army of insect-size soldiers. (Wouldnt it be more effective to shrink the opposing armies and then just stomp on them?) Evangeline Lilly with a Louise Brooks bob plays Douglass snippy daughter who doesnt see why a cluck like Scott gets to wear the ant suit instead of her. The answer lies somewhere in the subatomic world beyond the laws of time and space but not corny father-daughter melodrama. Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish (Shaun of the Dead etc.) are credited with the story but I have a feeling their touch turned out to be too anarchic for Marvel. Adam McKay and Rudd get screenplay credit too which means theyre likely to blame for Scotts painfully witless interjections. It doesnt matter too much given that the amiable Rudd is literally impossible to dislike. Literally not figuratively. Try to dislike him -- you cant. I thought Lilly looked better with her hair au naturel on Lost but Im happy to see her cool intelligence onscreen and Stoll gives a lean uninflected performance -- no camp no theatrics -- that I found genuinely chilling. Ant-Man isnt much more than pleasant (Peyton Reed directs limply) but anything Marvel that doesnt feel Marvel-ish makes me smile. My favorite moment is when Douglas has to comment acidly on something that happened in The Avengers Age of Ultron and stumbles over the words -- he cant get them out and is visibly distressed. If that was the take they used what were the others like? Maybe he started screaming ""F--- the %^amp;% Avengers I wont plug your dumbass convoluted %^amp;% universe"" and left on a gurney.

While the pair duke it out in typical Marvel fashion - lasers punches quips - the camera pulls back showing their battle royale as merely a blip in a childs bedroom an epic struggle that will be swept away when its time for bed. The scene is quick but just one of many metafictional digs director Peyton Reed takes at the Marvel machine.As the latest instalment in the studios assembly line factory Ant-Man occupies a curious place on the companys toy shelf. For one it was never supposed to exist at least not in its current form. Conceived back in 2006 as a vehicle for Shaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright - and presumably his excessive genre sensibilities - the film was put through so many development speedbumps and studio tinkering over the course of a decade that the filmmaker left the project in frustration last May.Yet Ant-Man was the final entry in Marvels so-called Phase Two wave of films and apparently such an integral part of their heavily plotted release calendar - which has films slated from now until July 12 2019 - that to abandon it would set off a chain reaction of events that would alter the course of our very universe (i.e. studio shareholders expectations). Reed was quickly shuffled into place with a new script by star Paul Rudd and his Anchorman director Adam McKay.It was always whispered that what Wright was planning for Ant-Man was either too subversive or off-base for Marvels middle-of-the-line tastes. The news that Reed - best known for his peppy if conventional Bring It On - had taken the reins was disheartening for those anticipating something even the teensiest bit different from the comic-book industrial complex.Against all odds though Reed has made not just one of the more entertaining Marvel movies - infinitely better than Joss Whedons overstuffed Avengers Age of Ultron - but a genuinely fun and clever deconstruction of the genre too. The beats are familiar A broken man (Rudd here but Robert Downey Jr./Mark Ruffalo/Chris Hemsworth/Chris Evans elsewhere) discovers a gift of great power and uses it both for personal salvation and the greater good.Yet in Reeds world everything is a bit twisted. Rudds Scott Lang is a smirking crook fully aware of the ridiculousness surrounding him but with such an amiable oh-what-the-hell attitude that were happy just to take it all in stride. The power here is also not innate such as Thors alien strength or Tony Starks ultra-genius but a shrinkable suit fuelled by a serum created by another man entirely. Its the superhero mythos distilled through a bro-comedy lens. I half-expected Ben Stiller to show up as Derek Zoolander and utter that films trademark ""What is this? A centre for ants?"" joke. But alas Reed cant deliver everything.What he can produce though is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of pop The little blockbuster that could wrapped in a few neat genre guises. Ant-Man is a comic-book movie naturally but it also smashes up against the heist film - with its Oceans 11-like plot of charming outsiders infiltrating a high-tech compound - and even the tightly wound family melodrama with a pair of father-daughter tales at its emotional sometimes mushy core.By the films winking climax near Thomas the Train Engines tracks of doom its clear that Reed has done the impossible surviving and thriving while inside Marvels restraints. Thats no small feat.

Its problem is its ""Ant-Man"" and its about a man who shrinks down to the size of and teams up with armies of ants.Alright lets quickly go down the superhero checklist. Batmans got the Batmobile Superman can fly Spider-Man treats cities like theyre his own personal jungle gym. And then over here youve got Ant-Man half an inch tall and hanging out with ants. At the superhero banquet dinner the guys definitely at the kids table.And ants just arent very interesting on screen no matter how theyre dressed up. There are numerous sequences in ""Ant-Man"" where Paul Rudd who plays the titular cat burglar-turned-superhero shares the screen with swarms of CGI ants and giving personalities to those little critters is a problem no amount of computer wizardry can solve. Likewise its no easy feat to wrangle excitement out of someone the size of a flea and try as it might ""Ant-Man"" just cant do it. As mighty as Ant-Man is you still just want to squash him with your foot.Which is too bad because otherwise ""Ant-Man"" hits the right notes. Rudd brings his wry boyish charm to the role of Scott Lang who when the movie opens is being let out of San Quentin after a three-year bid. Hes a non-violent offender were reminded several times over and besides hes Paul Rudd. Hes about as threatening as well an ant.The screenplay -- Rudd is one of the writers along with Edgar Wright Joe Cornish and Adam McKay -- mashes together mad science with family issues (Lang is trying to do right by his young daughter) and a plot to rule the world. You know typical Marvel Universe fare. But the tone is right light like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" rather than heavy like ""Captain America"" and the balance between jokes and action sequences keeps it afloat.Lang comes across the Ant-Man suit during a heist hes lured into by his old pals (including rapper T.I. and scene-stealer Michael Pena). Turns out the suit is the property of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) an ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who discovered a way to shift atoms -- or in laymans terms to make ones self really really small. Bad guy Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) had developed his own use for the the technology and Pyms daughter (""Losts"" Evangeline Lilly) has shifting allegiances. Elsewhere Bobby Cannavale plays a cop Judy Greer is Langs ex-wife and a lower-level Avenger makes an extended cameo. For a small movie ""Ant-Man"" has a lot going on.Rudd makes it work. Theres a scene early on where he shoots a wink to his daughter and in that split second is everything that makes Rudd so lovable. Hes 46 -- ""Clueless"" was 20 years ago -- but he could still pass for 32. Hes your pal from college who never changes your friends husband who makes dinner parties tolerable the dude you want to hang out with on weekends.What hes not is the buff superhero type and thankfully ""Ant-Man"" doesnt force him into a mold. Its the suit that has the superpowers not the man so were there to experience the learning curve to all that size-shifting along with Lang. Its when he teams with the ants -- or worse when he talks to them -- that its easy to check out.Director Peyton Reed (""Bring It On"" ""Yes Man"") stages some fun ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids""-style sequences including one winner with Thomas the Tank Engine and he does what he can to elevate Ant-Man from second-tier superhero status. But despite some strong touches ""Ant-Man"" feels like a superhero stopgap something to pass the time while the Avengers are on vacation or the Justice League is at a business retreat.agrahamdetroitnews.comgrahamoramaAnt-ManGRADE B-Rated PG-13 For sci-fi action violenceRunning time 117 minutesAnt-Man (PG-13) 26 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1MvlLOW MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/07/15/rudd-charms-makes-ant-mans-shortcomings/30212311/,200,ant-man10,ant-man,detroitnews

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 16 2015 Save for later Saved Ant-Man stars Paul Rudd. Zade Rosenthal/Disney/Marvel/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Superhero movies How well do you know them? Monitor Movie Guide As Marvel superheroes go Ant-Man doesnt seem very high in the pantheon. Its all a bit confusing Hes tiny but as powerful as a full-grown man. At times he expands to normal size and then hes tiny again bouncing through storm drains and air shafts dodging rats and cars and peoples feet. Size matters when it comes to superheroes and Ant-Man at least for me is at least one size too many.Now that Ive cleared my throat I admit that ""Ant-Man"" starring Paul Rudd as Scott Lang the genial ex-con who ends up as the shape-shifty Marvel marvel is fairly good fun especially around the edges when its not bogged down in exposition. (My favorite moment comes during a high-tech break-in when one of Ant-Mans human-size helpmates well-played by Michael Pena sings a few bars from ""Its a Small World After All."")Rudd is a good choice to play this hero because his derring-do is made to seem both suspenseful and risible. His nemesis Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) the renegade protege of good-guy scientist Dr. Pym (Michael Douglas) creator of the clandestine Pym Particle that gives rise to Ant-Man is a standard-issue baldheaded meanie which by contrast somehow makes Ant-Mans exploits seem even loopier. Recommended Superhero movies How well do you know them? I wish the film had gone even further into loopiness. Like Ant-Man the film directed by Peyton Reed comes in two sizes  - its sometimes big on laughs but often small on risk-taking. Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence.)

"Ant-Man | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ant-man ) Ant-Man (United States 2015) July 16 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Ant-Man as obscure a superhero title as has been released since the inception of the so-called ""MCU"" (Marvel Cinematic Universe) may test the perception that Marvel can do no wrong. The general public knows Spider-Man Iron Man Captain America and The Hulk but they dont know Ant-Man. And unlike what happened with Guardians of the Galaxy Marvel hasnt carpet-bombed pop culture with a marketing blitz. So Ant-Man has to stand on its own merits with only the Marvel brand to differentiate it from for example Green Lantern. The movie tries to offer something marginally different from the run-of-the-mill superhero origin story. Its hard to say how much of Edgar Wrights original vision remains in the final product but the tone is more jokey than that of most Marvel movies. Unfortunately its almost impossible to make it through the entirety of Ant-Mans two hours without thinking of Honey I Shrunk the Kids as least once and Im not sure thats an association the filmmakers were courting. Narratively tone differences aside this follows the ""origin story"" formula with little variation. With the exception of an unfortunate deus ex machine plot point every beat of Ant-Man is predictable. The movie is engaging in the same way as a generic romantic comedy we know exactly whats going to happen at every moment but theres some comfort in that. Ant-Man contains some compelling scenes (theres a great fight sequence between the title character and someone more established from the MCU) but theres nothing innovative in terms of content or how it is presented. Ant-Man scampers along with a ""been there done that"" vibe. The attempts at overt comedy are hit-and-miss. The heist elements are derivative and not nearly as inventive as one might expect given the possibilities. The action sequences are variable and the dramatic moments... the less said the better. Despite having buffed up physically for the part Paul Rudd is an unlikely choice to play a superhero. His character Scott Lang is intended to be an ""ordinary guy"" and the actor imbues Scott with the most ordinary of traits hes kind-of boring. The defining factor in Scotts life is that he wants to be a good dad. After spending some time in prison (he once earned his living as a Robin Hood-inspired cat burglar) Scott has a lot to make up for. The problem with this backstory is that the screenplay never sufficiently cultivates the relationship between Scott and his daughter for us to really care. As played by Abby Ryder Fortson Cassie is a one-note ""cute"" movie child that the filmmakers fail to develop. Her scenes with Rudd dont gel. This is a critical rent in the films dramatic fabric. The movie opens with a scene in which an impressively de-aged Michael Douglas playing Dr. Hank Pym takes a moral stand against the military-industrial complex. Led by Howard Stark (John Slattery) a group wants to weaponize Pyms breakthrough technology which can shrink objects. Jumping ahead a few decades we learn that Pym is now on the outside of his company looking in. His former protege Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) is running the show aided by Pyms estranged daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly). When he realizes they have nearly succeeded in duplicating his research he decides its time for someone to wear the incredible shrinking suit he once used. He chooses ex-con Scott and goes about recruiting him.  His chief selling point by becoming Ant-Man Scott can redeem himself in his daughters eyes. Ant-Man feels overlong with a lions share of the screen time devoted to the obligatory scenes of Scott learning his ""craft."" We get the expected training montage; I suppose no superhero origin story would be complete without this. Theres a quasi-romance between Scott and Hope that comes out of nowhere and goes nowhere. Ant-Man is hyper-aware of its place in the MCU. It name-drops shamelessly and features several appearances by characters we have seen before. The overall effect is to remind us that there was a time when the MCU was less crowded and more fun. Stand-alone superhero movies have no place in this universe anymore. Numerous previous productions have used special effects to create the illusion of a man reduced to insect size and forced to navigate the micro world. Ant-Man in part because it mixes practical and computer-generated visuals does perhaps the best job of this to-date. The movie doesnt dwell on the perils of being no larger than a thimble but thats not its goal. Some of the quixotic imagery late in the proceedings is less successful. The 3-D as is often the case is unnecessary and sometimes distracting. Its obvious that only a select few directors understand how to employ 3-D to enhance a production; based on the evidence at hand Reed (Yes Man) isnt among their number. Ant-Man isnt ""bad"" in the sense that many movies are ""bad."" Its just lackluster - a diversion with no staying power. The lead character is interchangeable with any number of Grade B superheroes - his unique ""power"" doesnt make the results or the means to achieve them sufficiently different. It wasnt that long ago when superhero movies took chances. (Remember The Dark Knight?) Now they are risk-averse. Thats perhaps the most disappointing thing about Ant-Man. For comic book fans the addition of Ant-Man to the Marvel family will undoubtedly be greeted with high-fives and cheers. The movie however doesnt give the rest of us a reason to care. As the post-credits caption informs us Ant-Man will return although its likely hell be back as part of a team. This is an appetizer and like most meager fare it doesnt satisfy. Lets hope the main course when it comes offers more than these warmed-over hors doeuvres.

Master thief Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) must embrace his inner-hero and help his mentor Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) protect the secret behind his spectacular Ant-Man suit from a new generation of towering threats. In theaters July 17. (Credit Marvel) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A small-time cat burglar becomes an ant-size superhero. Rated PG-13 (action violence some scary moments). BOTTOM LINE Rudds charm and an overall sense of silliness make for breezy summer fun. Its also Marvels most kid-friendly movie yet. CAST Paul Rudd Michael Douglas Evangeline Lilly LENGTH 157 For those who dont spend much time in the comic-book universe the release of ""Ant-Man"" might suggest that Marvel is finally scraping the bottom of its barrel. Has it really come to this -- a small superhero who can lift stuff? As it happens ""Ant-Man"" possesses one of the greatest superpowers in cinema a sense of humor. True its story line is a muddle and its characters slightly thin but so what? With the preternaturally likable Paul Rudd in the title role and a generally breezy hey-its-just-a-movie attitude ""Ant-Man"" is impervious to any nitpicking. Its good summer fun and as a bonus to parents its Marvels most kid-friendly movie yet. advertisement | advertise on newsday Rudd plays Scott Lang a thief with a heart He went to prison for hacking into a corrupt financial firm and returning the money to citizens. Now hes out and trying to stay straight so he can visit his little daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson). Her mom and stepdad (Judy Greer Bobby Cannavale) are right not to trust Scott Within days hes cracking another safe. Surprise All he finds inside is an old weird (and very cool-looking) superhero suit. Here is where the script -- written partly by Rudd and his ""Anchorman"" collaborator Adam McKay -- loses focus but its also where the fun begins. The original Ant-Man Dr. Hank Pym (a classy Michael Douglas) wants Scott to wear the suit while his own daughter (Evangeline Lilly) gains the trust of a ruthless industrialist (Corey Stoll) who has developed a competing suit the Yellowjacket. Dont think about it too hard. Just enjoy the extended training montage in which Scott learns to shrink at will communicate with real ants and grapple with now-humongous vacuum cleaners sewer rats and human feet. Director Peyton Reed (""Bring It On"") has great fun executing miniature action sequences that poke fun at the overblown Marvel style. In one a tabletop model of a city is magnificently destroyed; another involves a Thomas the Tank Engine train-set. Michael Pena as Scotts chatty best friend provides some of the films funniest moments. All in all ""Ant-Man"" is a bigger treat than you might expect.

Zade Rosenthal/Marvel hide caption toggle caption Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Paul Rudd in Marvels Ant-Man. Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Maybe one day if were good boys and girls well get to see the Edgar Wright cut of Ant-Man. Wright a beloved cult filmmaker best known for his ""Cornetto"" trilogy of genre parodies left the itty-bitty-superhero movie in a high-profile split with Marvel last year after nearly a decade of work on the project. He was replaced by the decidedly less idiosyncratic Peyton Reed (Yes Man) though various parties have insisted the bones of the film remained in place and Wright still has a co-writing and executive-producer credit. So its difficult to know how much a Wright-helmed Ant-Man truly wouldve differed from Reeds. But pretending theres a more fascinating version of this film out there somewhere like the Richard Donner cut of Superman II is a great way to come to terms with how rote and unremarkable Ant-Man is. Even without a principled defender of cinema at the helm there should have been a lot going for Ant-Man. Its centerpiece is a Marvel hero who is inarguably even proudly (in this films depiction anyway) a member of the companys B-team which means he comes with fewer fan-imposed restrictions. His power -- the ability to shrink and grow at the push of a button while controlling an army of ants with his mind -- is goofy as all get out. And hes played by ageless funnyman Paul Rudd of Anchorman and countless others a guy who is the living embodiment of a humorous quip. Thats a potent combination; Guardians of the Galaxy made it work with similar ingredients. But here two hours transpire with very little of merit to show for it. Did time shrink when we werent looking like Ant-Man does at one point to escape a prison cell? We open in flashback on Hank Pym (a grizzly Michael Douglas) mad scientist for good and enemy to Iron Mans Stark dynasty furiously leaving his own company over a dispute regarding his secret formula. Pym as all good nerds know was the original Ant-Man and later we glimpse blurry photos of him in action during his 50s prime -- though he mostly just looks like a splotch on the camera. (Pause to note that this film sorely could have used an ""Amazing Stories""-style reel of Ant-Mans exploits with era-appropriate miniature sets. Alas twas not to be.) He recruits Scott Lang (Rudd) an electrical engineer turned burglar just finishing a prison sentence and trying to turn his life around for the good of his estranged daughter. To stop his rival the bald megalomaniac Darren Cross (Corey Stoll smug as a bug in a rug) from unleashing his shrink tech upon the world Pym needs a second-generation Ant-Man to don the ancient suit and infiltrate the lab from within. There are lots of family issues although this being a movie about creatures with hive minds all the emphasis on personal emotion seems misplaced. Beyond Scotts ritual movie-hero devotion to his daughter theres also his estranged wife (Judy Greer) and the dreaded New Boyfriend (Bobby Cannavale) whos also a cop although they couldve saved time by just making the otherwise useless wife the cop. And theres Pyms daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) who is angry that Scott is taking over the Ant-Man suit instead of her. I didnt realize until the credits were rolling that Hopes anger is the only reason for her existence -- the back-pat to justify such a thankless role is to pretend she couldve had a shot at the big time. The Pyms endless dialogue about their family history reeks of overheated exposition like a dung heap waiting to be fertilized so that action sequences may grow. Those effects scenes are the only ones projecting the sense of cheesy adventure that should be all over this thing. When Scott shrinks for the first time he becomes a prisoner in his bathtub before falling through his apartments floorboards and onto a spinning record at an EDM party death trap. Later he and Darren -- who has by this point become the laser-shooting pest Yellowjacket -- stage an epic battle in a childs playroom. They shoot at each other while riding model trains which is as it should be. Why Ant-Mans insta-grow weapons arent put to more use (like say on the terrifying rabbit doll Scott buys his daughter) is beyond me. When Rudd gets to crack a smile or when he lets his sidekick Michael Pena do it for him the film gets a spark. But most of whats in Ant-Man has also been in every other Marvel movie to date including but not limited to the superfluous Avenger cameo. To be interesting on their own merits Marvel movies need a genuinely creative personality at the helm your Whedons your Russos your Gunns. Without Wright this Ant-Man doesnt even bear the signs of a creative dispute -- its too small to bear many signs at all and its shrinking as we speak.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 315890551 Review Ant-Man is a minor win for the little guy REVIEW In ""Ant-Man"" the stakes are surprisingly small for a summer Marvel movie.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune July 16 2015 -- 245pm Marvel Studios Paul Rudd stars as Scott Lang/Ant-Man and Michael Douglas right plays science genius Hank Pym. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In its visual focus the weight of its characters and its storytelling ambition ""Ant-Man"" is the tiniest superhero fantasy in the Marvel universe. The hero is the little guy incarnate a shape-shifter growing in strength by shrinking in size. His biggest concern is the safety of his moppet daughter not the galaxy. The engine of the self-satiric plot is a corporate heist not an epic alien invasion flattening a metropolis. Other Marvel champions face interlocking challenges to their safety and sanity. This heros top worry is getting stepped on. The lead character enters the film not by floating down from Asgard taking a superhuman serum or being bitten by a radioactive spider. He just walks out of prison on release day. Nice guy Scott Lang (the ever-likable Paul Rudd) was locked away for a multimillion-dollar theft. It was he repeatedly explains burglary not robbery. A computer whiz outraged by his money-grubbing employers he turned digital Robin Hood returning the ill-gotten wealth to the good people they cheated. Still a crime is a crime. His good deed put him behind bars and into familial headaches as his ex-wife (Judy Greer) married her cop boyfriend (Bobby Cannavale) and denied Scott visitation to their cute-beyond-words daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson). His efforts to provide child support payments reveal a streak of cat burglar skills apparently developed in prison. Those talents persuade retired science genius Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to recruit Scott for a small-scale caper of his own. Very small-scale. Marvel Studios Paul Rudd stars as the tiny superhero in ""Ant-Man."" Wearing Hanks mechanized shrinking suit bite-sized Scott soon leads an ant army. Dont shiver if you have insect-phobia these are computer-created to look less hairy and scary than the real things. They are not the creepy-crawlies that invade your kitchen but pleasant helpful aides happy to put a sugar cube in your tea. Scott befriends a flying ant imaginatively dubbed Antony riding it into battle against bad guys who are out to seize the Pym Particle an invention of Hanks that could unhinge the world. While director Peyton Reed includes long periods resembling wide-angle macro photography of half-inch Scott much of the film is devoted to comedy. Part of it seems inherited from the script created by the projects originally planned director Edgar Wright (""Shaun of the Dead""). Who but Wright would have crafted a micro-scale battle to a pounding soundtrack of The Cures 1989 song ""Disintegration""? Or the fight on a moving Thomas the Tank Engine toy whose smashing conclusion is the films action high point? Rudd and co-writer Adam McKay (""Anchorman"") among the team that revised Wrights story seem to have created the amusing trio of Scotts quirky criminal sidekicks. Michael Pena hip-hop hero T.I. and David Dastmalchian are each distinctively funny. Penas habit of jitter-jawed storytelling sets off riptides of dialogue flashbacks that are solid gold comedy. Beyond that ""Ant-Man"" is an ant-i-climax. It doesnt rise to the screwball audacity of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Or ""Antz."" Or ""A Bugs Life."" But its an endearing exercise in style -- a playful small-scale crowd-pleaser that parodies its bombastic Marvel precursors. Its designed for comic book fanboys trivial satirically silly filled with action and light on human interest. ""Ant-Man"" isnt a film to rave about but enjoyable enough not to exterminate it in a Roach Motel. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Zade Rosenthal/Disney/Marvel via AP) Lets get small.Superhero movies have been suffering from thematic and budgetary bloat since Batman became a dark knight. It seems like every successive comic-book adaptation has been an exercise in one-upmanship with a cast of all-stars obliterating a major city in order to save the planet from the Ultimate Evil.Yawn. The people who wrote those original comics -- young men such as Stan Lee and Jack Kirby -- were weaned on popcorn. They had personal memories of matinee serials like ""Buck Rogers"" and stop-motion adventures like ""King Kong."" And the generation of directors who are now making the movie versions of those comics grew up on ""Ghostbusters"" and Steven Spielberg. Yet too few of them have learned to convey a sense of wonder and fun.Like the recent refreshing ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" ""Ant-Man"" is a rare Marvel movie that doesnt take itself seriously. It feels like a 1980s blockbuster pretending to be a 1950s creature feature.As the title character a freshly paroled burglar named Scott Lang who is lured into a top-secret project Paul Rudd isnt quite as charismatic as Chris Pratt in ""Guardians"" (or even as charismatic as Rudd himself in his purely comedic roles); but hes good company as we explore an alternate universe. The project Scott discovers during a burglary allows Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to shrink matter to microscopic size. With the aid of a retro Rocketeer spacesuit a tiny human with burglary skills could become the ultimate secret weapon. With nothing to lose divorced dad Scott becomes the test subject for Pyms project with the goal of stopping a rival scientist (Corey Stoll) from selling the technology to the evil Hydra cabal.From the novel ""Gullivers Travels"" to the movie ""Tom Thumb"" to the cartoon ""Epic"" there have been many wondrous depictions of shrinking and supersizing. But although Scott shrinks to the size of an insect the movie misses opportunities to convey that experience. Much of his time is spent with other ants who embody teamwork as they help him infiltrate various nefarious facilities. One problem is that Scott is armed with weapons that allow him to shrink or expand himself and other objects at will so he is constantly jumping back and forth between the micro and macro worlds. Theres rarely a sense that he is trapped in the micocosm of dust bunnies and spiderwebs. Only when a toy train becomes supersize do we experience a pleasure like the arrival of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man in ""Ghostbusters.""""Ant-Man"" isnt aiming that high. Soon the character will be absorbed into yet another all-star superhero movie. But this debut film is fun and everyone involved can proudly declare ""Honey I shrunk the Marvel Cinematic Universe.""What ""Ant-Man""  Three stars out of four  Run time 157  Rating PG-13  Content Sci-fi action violence Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Paul Rudd Ant-man Marvel Michael Douglas Joe Williams Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan July 16 2015 Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) assumes the Ant-Man mantle from Hank Pym in Marvels latest superhero film. (Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Pictures) Paul Rudd probably wouldnt make a casting agents shortlist for a Marvel superhero. Even if you view the actors charm -- worn less like a cape than a shrug -- and his apparent agelessness as superpowers his self-effacing Everyman nature makes him an eccentric choice for a comic book character. But then again Ant-Man is not your typical larger-than-life part. Possessing the ability to shrink to the size of an ant without altering his normal human strength Ant-Man on paper sounds like a rejected idea from a desperate comic book writers brainstorming session. Never mind his ability to exercise telepathic control over actual ants. (Be still my heart.) In the film ""Ant-Man"" Rudds version of the obscure Marvel character -- a hero first introduced in 1962 -- makes for a perversely pleasurable combination of puniness and power. Telling the story of Scott Lang a man who inherits the mantle of Ant-Man from the costumed crusaders originator Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) the movie deploys its real secret weapon wit. The second half of this nearly two-hour film is a pure delight -- fast-paced and funny and filled with special effects and humor as great as any recent Marvel movie with the possible exception of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" One of the films signature bits involves the disconnect between Ant-Mans tiny heroics -- which during the films climax take place on a childs train set -- and what those heroics look like to normal sized people. Ant-Mans mighty struggle to heave a Thomas the Tank Engine toy for instance is contrasted with the resulting plasticky clatter as it skitters harmlessly across the floor making for a sublime sight gag. Getting to that point however requires a little patience. For its first 60 minutes ""Ant-Man"" churns out a setup that is as protracted as it is necessary given the novelty of the character and the audiences unfamiliarity with his back story. Actor Paul Rudd plays a superhero with the ability to change his size in Marvels ""Ant-Man"" in theaters July 17 2015. (  / Walt Disney Pictures) Lang a divorced dad ex-con and recidivist cat burglar is recruited by Pym the aging inventor of a shrinking technology and the original Ant-Man to don Pyms old suit and go after a rival industrialist (Corey Stoll) whos trying to sell similar miniaturization hardware to bad guys. Unfortunately much of this prologue which also deals with Langs bond with his young daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson) and his rivalry with his ex-wifes new boyfriend (Bobby Cannavale) creeps along at a snails pace. Despite a visually clever sequence when Lang first tries on the ant suit -- encountering such dangers as a giant vacuum cleaner and a cataract of water from a bathtub spigot -- the first half of the film feels at times more like a relationship drama than an action movie. All that ends when the action kicks in round about the movies midway point. Once it does ""Ant-Man"" turns into a rousing ""Oceans Eleven""-style heist flick crossed with a mini-""Mission Impossible"" in which Lang and his army of six-legged ninjas attempt to steal the competing shrink-suit dubbed Yellowjacket. (Fair warning There are a number of scenes featuring CGI creepy-crawlies. To its credit the ""Ant-Man"" supporting cast looks uncomfortably lifelike presenting what could be a minor problem for the entomophobic moviegoer.) Its easy to see the appeal of the Ant-Man character to the films co-writer and original director Edgar Wright auteur of such quirky send-ups of genre film as ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz."" Theres a perverse magic to a hero whose un-Hulk-like underdog status -- the ability to bulk down never up -- is his strength not his weakness. Although Wright dropped out of the picture last year after creative differences surfaced with Marvel his replacement director Peyton Reed obviously respects the characters paradoxical power. It may take a while for the movie to wind up but ""Ant-Man"" punches well above its weight. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains sci-fi action violence and some rude language. 117 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

(Disney/Marvel) Robert Wilonsky Dallas Morning News RobertWilonsky rwilonskydallasnews.com Ant-Man a charming and joyful Marvel entry is small but mighty mighty (B+) Jul. 15 2015 1223pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... With Robert Wilonsky Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Ant-Man is officially the 12th entry in Marvel Comics so-called ""Cinematic Universe"" and -- no pun intended -- its also the smallest which is a very good thing following the all-hands-on-dreck Avengers Age of Ultron that came out in May but feels like it was three forevers ago. Its the perfect palate-cleanser for even the truest believer worn down and worn out by the blockbustering of comic books -- a twee cute-enough-for-kids adventure story about fathers and daughters and surrogate sons (so Marvel) and most important how cool it is to get small. Marvel hasnt made a movie this fun - this bright this charming this joyful -- since the first Iron Man in which Robert Downey Jr.s entitled smirk was its most lethal weapon. Ant-Man feels like the B-side of that first hit single a lightweight trifle thats got a good beat you can dance to. Even John Slattery shows up as Tony Starks long-dead dad Howard for the first time since Iron Man 2. Guardians of the Galaxy was a long-playing blast into outer space; Ant-Mans just a gas. The first-ever appearance of the Ant-Man The Ant-Mans actually been a big player in the Marvel Universe since his first appearance in Tales to Astonish in 1962; in fact he even co-founded the Avengers for those wondering why a studio in charge of a gazillion-dollar franchise would stoop to consider the little man skittering across the carpet.That Ant-Man was Hank Pym played here by Michael Douglas as the grumpy old Ant-Man looking for a successor to keep his shrinking serum out of the hands of the brutish broken acolyte (Corey Stoll who makes everything hes in this much better) who pushed Hank out of his own company. Pym who spends most of his time in an aging manse that looks like the one Douglas inhabited in Wonder Boys finds just the man he needs behind bars Scott Lang (the strangely ageless Rudd) a thief who does bad things for good reasons. Lang has a masters degree in electrical engineering which is just good enough to land him a job at Baskin-Robbins upon release from prison. He also has a daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson) falling under the sway of the could-be stepdad (Bobby Canavale) whos the cop aching to put Scott back behind bars. Hank meanwhile has his own issues with the daughter (Evangeline Lilly) who wants inside the suit Hank has convinced Scott to unknowingly steal from Hank (yes thats right) during one of several wittily beautifully constructed set pieces.The movie which feels like the most expensive movie Vincent Price never made arrives in theaters dogged by years of false starts and the departure of a director (Edgar Wright) whos better than anyone else at making parodies that play better than the thing theyre parodying. (Which would you rather watch again Hot Fuzz or Bad Boys?) Rudds now credited as a writer alongside Wright Attack the Block director Joe Cornish and Rudds Anchorman director Adam McKay -- quite the hodgepodge of styles but all awfully good at grin-making. A gag involving The Cure song ""Disintegration"" and a briefcase is but one of a handful of smart subtle gags.The unheralded Peyton Reed who broke up Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Anniston in the painful-for-all-the-right-reasons The Break-Up and who was last seen making episodes of New Girl () directed.

As another ho-hum teenage fantasy lost in the shuffle of a seemingly interminable parade of Marvel comics Ant-Man is a brainless bore and a colossal waste of money time and computer-generated special effects that will probably make billions. The market for superheroes is what it is and so is the movie. If you hate insects bring your own anti-itch ointment. ANT-MAN 1/2 (1.5/4 stars) Written by Edgar Wright Joe Cornish Adam McKay and Paul Rudd Directed by Peyton Reed Starring Paul Rudd Michael Douglas and Corey Stoll Running time 117 min. The script by four typists who should remain nameless is a disjointed compilation of recycled action unoriginal characters and mind-bending stupidity about Dr. Pym (Michael Douglas) a scientist in San Francisco who invents a revolutionary technology called the ""Pym Particle"" that can reduce objects to the size of a chipmunks cerebellum. Imagine what that could mean in fighting wars. But theres a boo-hiss villain on the loose named Darren Cross a.k.a. Yellowjacket (Corey Stoll) the evil head of the research corporation where Dr. Pym made his discovery who is also in love with the scientists daughter (Evangeline Lilly). If the secret formula falls into the wrong hands it could mean the end of the world Dr. Pym races against the clock to find a moron willing to don an Ant-Man suit that will shrink him to the size of a peanut and allow him to command an ant army. The person he chooses is a cat burglar named Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) who just got out of San Quentin with a degree in electrical engineering and a job scooping cones at Baskin-Robbins. Cue the ants. The leaden script is top-heavy with exposition before it ever gets to the action. You hear plenty about ICBMs quantum realms and sub-atomic regulators before you see the first ant. Then you cant get rid of them. The rest of the movie with simulated direction from a mixing-lab keyboard by somebody called Peyton Reed is a series of stunts borrowed from such sci-fi classics as The Incredible Shrinking Man and The Fly. But mostly its about the computerized ants. Millions of them. All kinds. Carpenter ants fire ants bullet ants--not to mention the ordinary ants that turn picnics into horror movies. While the ants carry Scott on their wings like helicopters Dr. Pym controls them with electro-magnetic waves. If the Ant-Man screws up he can shrink out of existence and disappear forever. That would leave his adoring little daughter at the mercy of her new stepfather played with stoic blankness by a wasted Bobby Cannavale. I dont blame him. Its hard to get too excited about a superhero the size of your index fingernail. Ant-Man is no Spider-Man or Avenger especially played by Paul Rudd who looks like a fraternity boy and has neither the charisma nor the cajones to carry an assignment of this magnitude. The whole thing leads to a final showdown between the computerized Yellowjacket and the computerized Ant-Man played out on a toy train. Yawn. The ants steal the picture.

A sci-fi caper movie about an inventor who drafts a thief to steal a knockoff of his shrinking technology before it falls into the wrong hands it feels a world away from the cross-cut planetary peril climaxes that have become the studios default mode. Even its humor--usually seen as one of the stronger points of the Marvel house style--is different. Though some viewers may find themselves playing spot-the-author with the patchy script (e.g. a fight scene gag involving The Cures Disintegration which smacks of Wright) it still makes for an enjoyable intermittently inspired effects-driven comedy and a welcome antidote to the over-burdened world-saving that seems to define big-screen superhero stories.Paul Rudd stars as Scott Lang a good-hearted ex-con whos been reduced to working fast-food jobs and sharing a dingy apartment with his motor-mouthed former cellmate Luis (Michael Pena). Severely behind on child-support payments Lang agrees to join Luis on one last job breaking into the home of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) a reclusive tech millionaire who once battled wrongdoers as a size-altering insect-controlling superhero named Ant-Man. Soon Lang finds himself roped into a scheme to help Pym and his semi-estranged daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) break into the headquarters of the company Pym founded in order to prevent former protege Darren Cross (Corey Stoll doing his best Miguel Ferrer) from re-creating the Ant-Man shrinking suit and mass-producing it as a weapon. Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D.--the fictional warring agencies of the Avengers-centered Marvel screen universe--are involved though they might as well be the Soviets and the CIA; in stretches the movie feels more like a high-concept Chevy Chase flick than a Marvel stand-alone. Extravagant special effects are taken for granted in superhero movies but Ant-Man has enough imagination to make them seem both fun and necessary whether its during a scene where the shrunken Lang finds himself dodging Lucite heels on a dance floor or in a psychedelic space-folding sequence set in the Microverse the dimension of the sub-atomically small. Lang dressed in the red-and-black high-tech Ant-Man suit faces a parody of big-screen destruction in an architectural model dukes it out with the big bad inside a tumbling briefcase and dodges a creepy eye-swiveling Thomas The Tank Engine on a train set. Its fitting that a movie that flaunts its reduced scale should build toward a climax set entirely inside a suburban bedroom. Director Peyton Reed (Down With Love Yes Man) shows a knack for managing and integrating effects though he occasionally seems thrown by the movies competing comic sensibilities which swing from improv-esque deadpan (Adam McKay assisted with rewrites) to complicated audiovisual gags like the montages that accompany Luis convoluted explanations of basic plot points. Both approaches yield their share of funny stuff bolstered by good casting that ranges from Judy Greer and Bobby Cannavale as respectively Langs ex-wife and her cop fiance to cameos from Gregg Turkington and the voice of Tom Kenny. Still it makes for some occasionally uneven storytelling; its only during the extended effects-heavy sequences that Ant-Man feels like a movie in control of itself.

Credit Marvel By Peter Travers July 15 2015 More News See Jimmy Fallon Paul Rudd Play Drinko Chug Tequila Gravy Top 40 Marvel Movie Ideas Ranked All Stories >> The latest film franchise culled from Marvels comic-book universe packs a ton of fun into a teeny package. Its low-key charm helps glide us over trouble spots in tone and pacing. Ant-Man stars Paul Rudd as standard-sized Scott Lang a petty thief who gets to shrink at will and cause all sorts of trouble. Ant-Man may not have the hulking clout of the Avengers but the little bastard from Marvels second-tier gets the job done. The movie version benefits from not being familiar to the point of frustration. More News See Jimmy Fallon Paul Rudd Play Drinko Chug Tequila Gravy Top 40 Marvel Movie Ideas Ranked All Stories >> Related From Avengers to X-Men A Brief History of Superhero Movies From early serials to the Marvel Cinematic Universe era heres how the men-in-capes movie evolved Heads up short attention spans youre in for some heavy exposition before director Peyton Reedrolls out the special effects which are spectacular. Oscar winner Michael Douglas who classes up the place by his very presence plays Dr. Hank Pym a scientist whose particle research has resulted in a suit that can reduce a man to ant size and in the wrong hands spark mass destruction. S.H.I.E.L.D. has been coveting that suit since 1989. The prologue featuring Douglas with his face digitized into youthful Gordon Gekko smoothness lays out the parameters of battle Its peace-loving Pym versus such war mongers as Pyms former protege Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) whos come up with his own scary  shrink-suit Yellowjacket. Talk about having a bee in your bonnet. The script by Joe Cornish and the terrific Edgar Wright with a frisky polish by Rudd and Adam McKay explains it all for you. It also leaves you wondering about the delicious experiment Wright once slated to direct would have made of it. Luckily Rudd is the kind of actor youd happily follow anywhere. His cat burglar is just out of San Quentin and trying to go straight for the sake of his young daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). Pym thinks Scott is the just the guy to get into the ant suit and pull a fast one on Cross. Pyms daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) thinks she not Scott the screw-up should wear the suit. Wake up girl. In Marvels male-centric fantasyland thats never gonna happen. Related Summer Movie Preview 2015 From Superheroes to Strippers From Age of Ultron and Fury Road to Jurassic World the seasons epic sizzlers are big mean and mad as hell So its two dudes Scott and Pym both with daughter issues who are left to save the world from power-hungry psychos. And oh did I mention Michael Pena offers welcome comic relief and then some as Luis Scotts motor-mouthed henchman? Learning that Pyms safe is made of the same metal as the Titanic Luis notes ""that stuff killed DiCaprio."" What revives Ant-Man from too much backstory is its sense of visual mischief. Its a treat watching Scott pull a Spider-Man and learn how to jump in and out of keyholes change size and use his mind to marshal armies of ants. Weve seen some of these tricks before most effectively in 1957s The Incredible Shrinking Man and 1989s Honey I Shrunk the Kids. But you aint seen nothing yet till you get a load of mini Scott navigating the perils of a seemingly harmless bathtub carpet train set and a curious mouse. Marvel fans know to stay for a coda after the end credits. Fake out -- this time there are two codas. Is Ant-Man good enough to make you want to stick around even for a sequel? Thats debatable. But it sure does go down easy. In a hard-sell summer thats enough to make Ant-Man stand tall.

Movie Review    Ant-Man with Paul Rudd Michael Douglas Evangeline Lilly Corey Stoll Thomas the Tank Engine. Directed by Peyton Reed from a screenplay by Edgar Wright Joe Cornish Adam McKay and Rudd. 120 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence. Several theaters. Hes in the movie all right played by a goateed Michael Douglas. But hes old and has hung up the characters signature Ant suit. The guy who inherits that suit is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd all stubbly). And hes well let him run down his list of particulars (per the ""Ant-Man Prelude"" comic) ""I was a failed criminal a convict and a terrible husband."" A loving dad though and willing to do anything to redeem himself in the eyes of his cutie-pie young daughter Cassie (Abbie Ryder Fortson gooily sweet).

Rudds Lang is a nice though pretty ineffectual fellow out of the suit and in the early going rather a bumbler in it. He also gets belted around and roundly scorned by Pyms judgmental daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly her stare disapproving her hair severely styled). The characterizations are tissue thin and are characterized by lots of blather. Pym hectors Lang to be the hero that his daughter imagines him to be. Pym and Hope bicker a bunch over Pyms failures as a father. For thrills there are immense amounts of busy stunt work by those CG ants. Look lets put it this way When your most memorable character turns out to be Thomas the Tank Engine featured in two hilarious scenes you know your picture about a tiny superhero has big big problems.

Director Peyton Reed (157). PG-13. Area theaters. 3-D where available. ""Ant-man"" is proof that pretty good things come in small packages. Were not just talking physical size either. This new extremely lightweight but still fun Marvel movie adventure lacks the apocalyptic bombastic overfantastic quality that so many superhero movies have. But that helps the movie deliver goofy kicks without getting an enlarged sense of itself. Paul Rudd stars as Scott Lang a good-natured San Francisco burglar who spent three years in San Quentin for industrial larceny. His anti-establishment ways and thieving skills attract the attention of Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Pyms an aging scientist (and former S.H.I.E.L.D. operative we learn in the first scene) who needs someone to break into his former laboratory. Pym must retrieve ""the Pym Particle"" a shrinking formula he created. It ""reduces the distance between atoms"" if you must know and needs to be out of the hands of his evil former underling Darren Cross (Corey Stoll). Pyms daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) works with Cross but shes on her dads side. Marvel thinks small Ant-Man goes into action. (Zade Rosenthal / Marvel) Paul Rudd stars as Scott Lang a thief who stumbles into a new line of work. (Zade Rosenthal / Marvel) Ant-Man can shrink to the size of a dime but retains his full-size strength. (Marvel) Pym recruits Lang to wear a special suit Pym himself once donned to become ... Ant-Man Now able to zoom down to the size of a dime (yet still deliver a full-size punch) Lang can get in and out of tight spots. Oh and he can control an army of ants by the use of radio waves that transfer his thoughts into insect-speak. But Cross who dons his own shrinking costume called the Yellowjacket wont be defied. ""The Avengers"" this aint. But thats part of the point. (Lang even suggests they call that Marvel supergroup which will soon include Ant-Man.) Where most heroic adventures have a stereotypical ""first use of new powers"" montage the version here of that staple shows Lang stumbling around a bathtub and getting sucked up into a vacuum cleaner. Eventually he gets the hang of things. And so does director Peyton Reeds quirky heist-comedy adventure. From left Evangeline Lilly Paul Rudd and Michael Douglas in ""Ant-Man."" (Zade Rosenthal / Marvel) Paul Rudd as Scott Lang in ""Ant-Man"" (Zade Rosenthal / Marvel) Evangeline Lilly plays Hope Van Dyne in ""Ant-Man."" (Zade Rosenthal / Marvel) Michael Douglas plays scientist Hank Pym (Zade Rosenthal / Marvel) Because of his easygoing comedy persona Rudd is a perfect choice -- and another example of Marvels savvy casting. He never takes anything too seriously but he seems invested in the emotional side of the story. His Ant-Man costume recalls a 1950s alien toy or a Jules Verne-esque underwater explorer. Douglas lends a wry note Stoll has a great sneer and Lilly provides a grownup sexiness to this kid-friendly lark. The shrinking effects and ant army are cool as well. Reed keeps his protagonist zipping from big to small to keep things peppy. It works though the overall feel is like a retro TV series or a tasty dessert after the usual inflated superhero buffets. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Photo Marvel MOVIE REVIEW Ant-Man Running time 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence profanity). If Id been told someone connected with Marvel movies would be saying ""Sorry sorry"" this summer I would have guessed it would be Joss Whedon talking about ""Age of Ultron."" But instead its ""Ant-Man"" apologetically beating the tar out of a guy and showing hes a refreshingly reluctant superhero. Paul Rudd -- the kind of schlump you can imagine getting fired by Baskin-Robbins but also hacking an impregnable tech company -- turns out to be an ideal choice to play Scott Lang a good-guy cat burglar recruited by a prickly scientist (Michael Douglas) to use a shrinking gizmo that will reduce him to the size of an ant and give him amazing strength. Paul RuddPhoto Marvel Much as in ""Iron Man"" the scientist Dr. Hank Pym has a rivalry with a more diabolical tech genius (Corey Stoll) who is on the verge of duplicating the shrink-suit but plans to use it for world domination via a different insect Hes Yellowjacket-Man. Someone needs to open up a can of whoop-ass on this guy or at least a can of Raid. Rudd who co-wrote the script with three others takes care to establish Scott as an endearing loser who hangs out with three other lovable crooks and needs a job to win back visitation rights to his daughter. Much less arrogant and quippy than other Marvel characters (and nearly everyone in ""Age of Ultron"") he carries a major tactical advantage Hes vulnerable. Hes the only superhero who risks not only getting shot but stepped on. Much of the (limitless) boredom of ""Ultron"" came from the sense that everything came too easily. Evangeline Lily (from left) Paul Rudd and Michael DouglasPhoto Marvel ""Ant-Man"" is at its best in the establishing scenes and in the middle when Scott learns how to operate the shrink suit -- you can get small and then revert to normal size at the touch of a button -- and how to work with the other ants who take electromagnetic direction from Pym. To fight he learns from Pyms daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) who calls him ""Princess"" while shes belting him. Unfortunately for her the four (dudes) who wrote the script evidently thought ""Well make her an ass-kicker"" was both original and sufficient to define her. Watching Ant-Man in action is a lot of fun though; his practical invisibility means director Peyton Reed (""Bring It On"" ""The Break-Up"") can stage action with the wit of the Quicksilver scenes in ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" One such scene involves a surprise confrontation with an Avenger whose group Pym has broken with because of a feud with Ironmans father. Paul RuddPhoto Marvel Closer in spirit to sci-fi movies like ""The Fly"" and to heist flicks than to the lesser superhero spectacles and their obsession with selling tickets to low-attention-span teens ""Ant-Man"" depends much less on meaningless fighting and destruction and much more on playful imagination. The humor is organic not like Whedons forced jocularity. One ""Ant-Man"" crisis involves merely surviving a bathtub filling with water and getting tossed onto a turntable at a dance club. The love story between Scott and Pyms daughter is an afterthought while the climactic third act is a bit too easy -- it seems to take longer to explain how to break into the tech firm than to actually do so. But the film never flags. To find a smarter bug-man saga youd have to go back to ""The Metamorphosis."" I was far from sold on insect superheroes but now I say Bring on Cockroach Chick.

Good but never great.Paul Rudd shrinks in size and charm as the tiny superhero.(Photo Disney/Marvel)Story HighlightsThe script has been in development for years and it shows.The scope is smaller which is a good thing but so is Rudds command of the role.Critics rating 3 stars out of 5""Ant-Man"" is necessarily smaller in scope (and in hero) than the other movies in the Marvel universe.Which is fine. A hero who can shrink and expand at will is an intriguing idea a kind of built-in underdog. The problem with Peyton Reeds film is that when he shrinks the always-affable Paul Rudd he shrinks a big part of Rudds charisma too.Actually the charisma isnt on display too often when Rudd is big either. We see winks and nods (sometimes literally) toward his typical on-screen persona but it comes and goes. And not as if hes turning it on and off at will. More like the movie is put together in haphazard fashion.It may have been. The film has been knocking around in development for ages with Edgar Wright on board as director at one point. (He is still credited as a producer and co-writer.) It would have been interesting to see what Wright (""Shaun of the Dead"" ""The Worlds End"") could have done with this movie with this cast.Its somewhat less interesting to see what Reed has done.NEW FILMS Ant-Man TrainwreckIts not all bad. Its agreeable in fact with flashes of what could have been had Rudd been unleashed. (And lets not put all the blame on Reed -- Rudd and Adam McKay ended up writing the final version of the script.) It chugs along happily enough but never kicks into the higher gear you keep waiting (and hoping) for.Rudd plays Scott Lang who is finishing three years in prison for a Robin Hood-like crime. He wants to go straight so that he can be with his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) but when youve got a record jobs are hard to find and harder to keep. (Funny line ""Baskin-Robbins dont play."")Ant-Man left its troubled development with a few nasty scars. (Photo Disney/Marvel)Meanwhile the clearly unhinged Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) is making great strides in continuing the work of his mentor Henry Pym (Michael Douglas) a scientist who long ago figured out how to shrink himself. (It isnt mentioned explicitly here other than quick footage in a newsreel but Pym was the original Ant-Man.)But Pym decided that the technology was too dangerous and shut down the suit and the technology. Cross has no such moral compass and hes willing to rent the technology to bad guys once he has perfected it.Pym to the consternation of his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly with odd Louise Brooks-type hair) decides Lang is the best hope to stop Cross. Hope wants to tackle the mission herself but grudgingly agrees to help train Lang in how to use the Ant-Man suit and how to control the various types of ants that will serve as his miniature army in his battle against Cross.So far so regular. But there are also lots of daddy-daughter issues -- not just the ones between Pym and Hope but between Lang and Cassie who thinks hes a hero when everyone else sees him as a criminal.By and large the effects are good and a micro battle atop a Thomas the Tank Engine train is edited cleverly -- a joke Reed evidently found so funny he uses it twice in a couple of minutes. But the action scenes are often confusing; the small-to-large-and-back-again shifts are disorienting making everything hard to follow.AZCENTRALAnt-Man (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThere is the obligatory Avengers tie-in (hello Falcon) and the mid-post credits and after-credits blips that Marvel has become known for. (The payoff is pretty meager.)But for all its shortcomings there are some things to like here. Michael Pena overdoes it a little as Langs former cellmate enlisted to help but his shaggy-dog stories are funny. Stoll is convincingly smarmy as an evil genius. The pace isnt as exhaustively break-neck as some of the other Marvel films a refreshing change.And even a muted Rudd is better than no Rudd at all. When he does break out the slightly goofy charm its a welcome treat. Ant-Man famously doesnt have weapons on his suit but Pym does arm him with discs that make small things big. Too bad Reed didnt use one on Rudds personality because in this case more would have been better.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Disney/Marvel Disney/Marvel Disney/Marvel Ant-Man     (out of five) Director Peyton Reed Cast Paul Rudd Michael Douglas Evangeline Lilly Rated PG-13 (sci-fi action violence) Running time 117 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 150pm on Wednesday Jul. 15 2015 Wednesday Jul. 15 2015 Wednesday Jul. 15 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Ant-Man could have ended up seeming more like Cant Man.Originally Edgar Wright -- the British mind behind the cult favorites Shaun of the Dead Hot Fuzz and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World -- was to direct this latest installment in the ever-expanding Marvel universe. But his vision for the micro superhero honed over nearly a decade of trying to get it onto the screen apparently was too ""quirky"" for Marvel and he bailed leaving the studio to bring in Peyton Reed whose resume includes the less well-regarded The Break-Up and Bring It On.Considering all these off-camera shenanigans Ant-Man -- about a man who shrinks to the size of an ant to fight evil -- doesnt completely come up short. As it dutifully marches toward its special-effects-driven conclusion Ant-Man has enough charm to be engaging if not particularly memorable once the end credits roll -- and yes you should stay through them for the usual Marvel promo. For now though superhero fans should just be thankful that its no Green Lantern.Part of Ant-Mans appeal is the always affable suburban-guy-next-door Rudd whos following in the footsteps of Robert Downey Jr. Mark Ruffalo and Chris Pratt in the unlikely-superhero department. Rudd acquits himself well as Scott Lang an ex-con with strong tech skills (he got sent up for burglary) who cant find a job now that hes back on the outside. Lang needs one so his ex-wife (Judy Greer) and her new cop boyfriend (Bobby Cannavale) will allow him to see his daughter.But job prospects arent good and when his old running buddy (a funny Michael Pena) and his two friends (T.I. David Dastmalchian) hatch a plan to sneak into a mansion with a huge safe that must have something valuable in it Lang volunteers as the one to execute the break-in.He doesnt know the house belongs to a reclusive millionaire scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) who has perfected the process of shrinking living matter but kept it away from the ambitious power-hungry guy running his company now Darren Cross (the ever-reliable character actor Corey Stoll). Along with his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) Pym wants to take back his company.So when Lang stumbles upon the suit in the safe and puts it on for the first time he finds himself in the middle of the Pym powerplay and his plans to take down Cross whos also working on miniaturizing people before Cross can take over the world.The best parts of Ant-Man are when Lang is initially plunged into his mini-universe where swirling drains roaring vacuum cleaners and spinning club turntables become giant machines of death. During the finale when Ant-Man and a downsized bad guy are going mano a mano on a toy train track its a lot of fun.There are also some clever pop-culture touches (a nice shoutout to the Cure) and the Avengers Falcon (Anthony Mackie) even makes an appearance.Still Wrights film probably would have been the better one perhaps a cheekily subversive wrench in the unstoppable Marvel machine as opposed to just a mildly entertaining cog.But considering the even more dire alternatives Ant-Man is pretty good. And thats no small feat. Cary Darling 817-390-7571 Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

With the help of a special suit Rudd must embrace his inner hero to pull off a heist that will save the world. VPCScott Lang (Paul Rudd) has a pep talk with a new insect buddy in Ant-Man.(Photo Marvel)One superhero movie is about to do wonders for the sales of ant farms.Just as Jurassic Park put dinosaurs on the A-list Ant-Man (   out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) boosts the coolness factor of the insect community with Marvel Studios most distinctive solo character yet. While Avengers movies tend toward the superfan Ant-Man -- like last years Guardians of the Galaxy -- appeals to most anybody who can fathom a shrinking man.Paul Rudds Scott Lang is an ex-con and ace thief who cant quite get his life right. But deep down hes got heart and is as Avengers-ready as anyone with a high-tech suit that allows him to size down and commandeer ants. As Ant-Man he can fly through the air on a living winged helicopter and navigate a water main with the help of his little buddies huddled in tandem like a surfboard.Not everybody can be the Hulk you know.USA TODAYDomestic drama makes Ant-Man stand tallScott isnt having much luck ditching his life of crime in order to be a better dad for his little girl (Abby Ryder Fortson) and he ends up stealing the Ant-Man suit from its inventor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas).However its all part of Hanks plan. He has been ousted from his tech company by longtime protege Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) whos close to stumbling onto Hanks signature shrinking technology and using it in his military-grade Yellowjacket armor (think souped-up Ant-Man suit). In the wrong hands it could be a world-threatening weapon and the old man wants Scott to use his specific talents to swipe it.Theres a good amount of destruction along the way although director Peyton Reeds Ant-Man trades constant wanton action for universal gags (including one involving Thomas the Tank Engine) and themes.Scott teams with Hank to be the hero his kid thinks he is while Hank tries to reconnect with his own daughter Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) a spitfire who believes shes the one who should be suiting up as Ant-Man (or in her case Ant-Woman). Lilly has such a grasp on the character that everybody wanting a Black Widow movie is going to be yearning for a Hope film guaranteed.Tonally Ant-Man is a little all over the place -- at times its a quirky comedy heist film trippy sci-fi project and family drama never able to really blend everything in a cohesive fashion. (That possibly owes to Edgar Wright and Joe Cornishs original script being rewritten by Rudd and filmmaker Adam McKay.)USA TODAYRudd Douglas are big men in Ant-ManThat said when its on its game Ant-Man does some of the best stuff ever in a Marvel movie. Scott has to take on one of the mighty Avengers in a memorable scene played for laughs and action. And the montage in which Ant-Man learns to work with his tiny friends (on land sea and air) is visually spectacular as is an interesting trip to a never-before-seen quantum realm.The title hero comes off as a little too safe yet Rudd pulls off all the needed aspects of Ant-Man extraordinarily well for someone better known for his comedy chops than his karate ones Hes got sarcasm heroism and gravitas down pat. Rudd is also a great on-screen match for Douglas who even under a beard and a frown seems to having a ball giving his pointed opinion on Tony Stark in a knowing nod to the bigger Marvel Cinematic Universe.Stolls Cross is mostly one-dimensionally evil though that pays off when he puts on the Yellowjacket suit and looks sufficiently intimidating in his throwdown with Ant-Man. And the biggest scene-stealer is Michael Pena as Scotts motormouthed pal and maybe the worlds happiest criminal.Hes more than a little shocked seeing his friend as Ant-Man and mainstream moviegoers may be surprised too at how the smallest comic-book superhero can be such a big success in the right hands. 621 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1J0WuNx,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/07/15/ant-man-movie-review/30154713/,200,ant-man33,ant-man,usatoday
"Review Marvel comes up big with playful Ant-Man - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Marvel comes up big with playful Ant-Man Ant-Man Zade Rosenthal / Marvel Marvels ""Ant-Man."" Marvels ""Ant-Man."" (Zade Rosenthal / Marvel) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Theres no need for psychiatric intervention just quite yet but the mighty Marvel movie empire is showing definite signs of having a split personality.On the one hand you have those big clanking machines like ""The Avengers"" and ""Captain America"" stuffed to bursting with superhero braggadocio. Then there are the loose anarchic films more offbeat items that seem to come from another universe entirely. Films like ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Films like ""Ant-Man."" Playful in unexpected ways and graced with a genuinely off-center sense of humor ""Ant-Man"" (engagingly directed by Peyton Reed) is light on its feet the way the standard-issue Marvel behemoths never are. Its got a vintage science fiction feel and a climactic scene in which Thomas the Tank Engine rather than a crowd of interstellar invaders plays a major part. Business as usual this is not.You cant have a good Ant-Man movie without a good Ant-Man and in the genial and charming everyman Paul Rudd the filmmakers have done it right. When your protagonist Scott Lang is an ex-con introduced getting out of San Quentin after serving three years for burglary being likable means a lot. Rudd and his ""Anchorman"" director Adam McKay share one of the films writing credits but Rudd who has been with the project for years has publicly acknowledged the importance of the initial writing team. Ant-man eyes big opening Saba Hamedy ""Ant-Man"" will likely help the summer box office have another giant weekend. Disneys Marvel Studios film is expected to open with between 60 million and 65 million in the U.S. and Canada according to people familiar with pre-release audience surveys.  An opening in that range puts it on par with openings... ""Ant-Man"" will likely help the summer box office have another giant weekend. Disneys Marvel Studios film is expected to open with between 60 million and 65 million in the U.S. and Canada according to people familiar with pre-release audience surveys.  An opening in that range puts it on par with openings... (Saba Hamedy) That would be Edgar Wright (who was originally slated to direct as well) and Joe Cornish responsible between them for films like ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Attack the Block"" whose anarchic popular culture spirit can be felt here.Equally essential to the films success is the veteran Michael Douglas who brings an invaluable gravitas and stability to the film. Given that shrinking people to half an inch in height is the name of the game here anything that helps make that believable should not be undervalued. Photos from the world premiere of Marvels ""Ant-Man"" held June 29 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. Douglas plays Hank Pym the brilliant founder of Pym Technologies. We meet him in an opening sequence set in 1989 in which he accuses associates of trying to steal the powerful yet mysterious Pym particle. ""As long as I am alive"" Pym thunders ""no one will get that particle."" Duly noted. Back in the present Scott is getting out of prison met at the gate by his old cellmate Luis (a very funny Michael Pena). Luis would love it if Scott put his ""mad thieving skills"" to use but the newly freed man wants to reestablish a relationship with his cute estranged daughter Cassie (Abby Rider Fortson) so hes hoping for a life on the straight and narrow.Speaking of estrangement Hank Pym who was ousted from Pym Technologies by daughter Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) in favor of former Hank protege Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) returns to the building to hear Cross boast that he has made a major breakthrough that will enable him to create a tiny soldier the size of an insect. He calls it ""Yellowjacket"" and being a bit on the power-mad side tells everyone who will listen that hes ""transcended the laws of nature.""Little does anyone know that Pym himself managed such a breakthrough years before but for a variety of reasons never put it into action. Hes had his eye on Scott to be his man in the suit and through some amusing plot machinations makes this happen much to Scotts surprise and terror. Being half an inch tall is no fun if you dont know what youre doing.Though people getting taken down to tiny size is familiar to moviegoers from films like ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" and ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" one of the things that makes ""Ant-Man"" special is well the computer-generated ants.For once he gets the knack of using it one of Scotts powers as ""Ant-Man"" is a helmet that makes him a certified ant whisperer someone who can make these loyal brave and industrious insects his full partners in the exploits he undertakes.These are not just the garden variety of ant you might come across at a picnic. Ant-Man forms close ties with the architecturally inclined fire ants winged and dangerous carpenter ants wacky crazy ants even the perilous bullet ants whose bite is described as ""No. 4 on the Schmidt pain index"" which sounds pretty bad. These little guys are such great team players that after you see this film youll never be tempted to squash one of them again.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------Ant-ManMPAA rating PG for sci-fi action violenceRunning time 1 hour 57 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Ant-Man Paul Rudd Adam McKay Edgar Wright Minions has irresistible wonky golden touch Paul Rudd runs with the insects in new photos from Marvels Ant-Man Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad78deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-ant-man-review-20150716-column.html,200,ant-man34,ant-man,latimes

Paul Rudd stars as ""Ant-Man"" in a movie that may please viewers who dont think the Marvel mystique is all that super. Photo Handout McClatchy-Tribune News Service Ant-Man makes a little distinctive superhero 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The best thing about ""Ant-Man"" is that for much of its running time it doesnt seem like a Marvel Comics superhero movie. The worst thing about it is that it eventually does. Sooner or later men in skintight suits are shown doing battle probably to save humanity or something like that. But even then the action remains close to human scale or at least closer than usual. So ""Ant-Man"" is a strange case a superhero movie that might appeal most to people who would never go see a superhero movie -- not for free not even on an airplane maybe not even to save wounded fawns and baby rabbits. At the same time it just might disappoint audiences who see the name Marvel not as some unfortunate movie phase well just have to live through but as a stamp of cinematic excellence. The first clue that this is going to be a different sort of Marvel movie is that its directed by Peyton Reed whose stock in trade is comedy and whose 2003 movie ""Down With Love"" was one of the shrewdest satires of the previous decade. From the beginning the rhythms are comic and the tone is arch. And the comedy is not the cheap comedy of veiled references to other movies. Its grounded in character. The second clue is the casting of Paul Rudd a comic actor who is refreshingly unheroic but also not a nerd in need of superhero transformation. Hes normal only a little funnier than most people. At the start of the movie he is being released from prison having used his computer genius to steal money from a huge corporation and divert it to customers. In other words he is already a Robin Hood. Becoming Ant-Man wont be a step up but more like a lateral move. Like a lot of superhero movies ""Ant-Man"" attracted some strong talent. Unlike most of them ""Ant-Man"" doesnt leave the actors looking like greedy sellouts leaping on a paycheck. Michael Douglas plays scientist Hank Pym who already in 1989 invented the molecule-crunching formula that makes it possible for Ant-Man to exist. He must have been a genius because 26 years later his protege (Corey Stoll) is only now catching up and he plans to do precisely the thing that Hank refused to do -- sell the discovery to defense contractors. For a surprising length of screen time the science fiction is relegated to the periphery and ""Ant-Man"" is just the story of Scott Lang (Rudd) and his problems. Released from prison Scott cant find a job. He cant pay child support. His wife (Judy Greer) wont let him see his daughter and her new boyfriend (an implacable Bobby Cannavale) is blocking the door. He realizes he may have to turn to crime just to get enough money to survive. This first section doesnt feel like a prelude but like the substance of the entire picture. So when ""Ant-Man"" finally takes a Marvel turn and starts reminding us at first subtly that its a superhero movie the first thought is ""Oh no why did you have to go ruin it?"" It was pretty good as it was -- the story of a nice guy trying to find his footing after a prison term. Why bring in skintight costumes and saving the world? Its been done and done then done to death then revived and done then done some more ... Thats the peculiar problem of ""Ant-Man."" By being more than a superhero movie it reminds us of what its worse than. Its greatest virtue isnt that its a superior comic book movie but rather that it comes close to not being that at all. Close and yet not close enough. By the way it should be said what Ant-Man is and what he can do. Wearing his special suit he is capable of shrinking in size and then growing back to normal size in the blink of an eye. This can be useful in a fight. The shifts in size as well as Ant-Mans ability to make other objects grow and contract when necessary make for some clever action sequences and funny moments. Yet one of the best sequences isnt funny at all. It comes when Scott visits the land of subatomic particles. Something in the rendering of that with light bending and folding exploding and re-forming really does evoke an unseen world something splendid and terrifying at the heart of things. Its an unexpected and deepening moment in an otherwise lighthearted movie and it rounds out the experience. Mick LaSalle is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

And ""Ant-Man"" is proof that sometimes they cant. Im not looking to start any flame wars with fans whove always loved the little guy but face it -- he wasnt exactly Iron Man just made for a big-screen adventure. I mean remember the classic ""Saturday Night Live"" skit when it was a superhero party -- and poor Garrett Morriss Ant-Man got dissed at every turn? The makers of ""Ant-Man"" clearly do which is why theyve approached the story with humor. Based on the superheros late-70s incarnation Edgar Wrights original script (with Joe Cornish) has been rewritten by star Paul Rudd (with Adam McKay) and although the film doesnt turn the character into a joke you never have to wait more than a minute or two for the next gag. Its an understandable approach but as a result theres not much at stake here emotionally. The truly great Marvel superheroes struggle with hubris. Ant-Man mostly panics and yells and falls down a lot. The story has Rudds Scott Lang just getting released from prison -- the screenplay never can decide whether hes a hacker/corporate whistleblower or cat burglar/safecracker -- and coming under the eye of Dr. Hank Pym played by Michael Douglas. Pym a genius and an altruist doesnt like what his old colleagues are doing with his scientific breakthroughs. He needs someone to steal them back. Someone who with the help of those very scientific breakthroughs can get very very small. This is very clearly and consciously not another standard ""Avengers"" movie and not just because it takes a few potshots at S.H.I.E.L.D and the gang. Theres no sly sexual innuendo (but there is an adorable little girl). Theres no near-apocalyptic climax (but there is a cute giant ant). Its clearly aimed at younger audiences My Very First Marvel Movie. Forget the angst of the Hulk or the alienation of Captain America. Although we do have a few go-to superhero elements - the megalomaniac war profiteer played by Corey Stoll the kick-butt heroine played by Evangeline Lilly the aging male guest star appearance courtesy of Douglas -- from the start Rudd and director Peyton Reed push this in a different goofier direction. And face it that may be the only way to go with ""Ant-Man."" But sometimes Rudd is just a little too cute and dimply and sometimes Reed -- whos previously done comedies like the great ""The Break-Up"" the odd ""Down With Love"" and the awful ""Yes Man"" -- pushes things a little too hard particularly with Christophe Becks comic pastiche soundtrack or some oh-those-funny-minorities characters. But as hard as everyone here works Ant-Man emerges only as a minor hero - fine for occasional gags and cameos in upcoming Marvel ensembles but undeserving of all this attention. And his movie feels not like a well-deserved launch but a contractual obligation - arriving in theaters without any real purpose except adding another marketable character to an ever-expanding product line. Oh well. Gnats entertainment. Ratings note The film contains violence. Ant-Man (PG-13) Disney (117 min.) Directed by Peyton Reed. With Paul Rudd Evangeline Lilly Michael Douglas.

"Review Ant-Man saves the day -- seriously - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Ant-Man saves the day -- seriouslyBy Tony Hicksthicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 07/14/2015 033040 PM PDTUpdated 07/17/2015 050100 PM PDT Related StoriesJul 14Ant-Man director Peyton Reed seemed destined for job""Ant-Man"" is a much bigger movie than I expected.Sure -- roll your eyes at another obvious pun about Marvels latest superhero film adaptation. But this movie is an eye opener in so many ways from the unlikely star Paul Rudd nailing it as a superhero to how director Peyton Reed can make a microscopic character seem absolutely explosive on a big screen. But the biggest surprise is how this movie manages to be fresh and charming in a genre bloated with films trying and failing to be fresh and charming. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man in Ant-Man. (Zade Rosenthal/Marvel) ( Zade Rosenthal/Marvel ) Of course ""Ant-Man"" has the requisite destruction fighting special effects and good battling evil to qualify it for admission into the Avengers superhero universe. But theres a wink and a smile in the delivery. The different approach is evident when Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) quips that the world needs Ant-Man because other heroes are ""too busy dropping cities out of the sky"" (a dig at the last Avengers movie) and in the fact that one of the movies best action sequences happens on a childs train set.Rudd stars as Scott Lang a cat burglar fresh out of San Quentin and wanting to do right by his young daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). Struggling to find a straight job Lang ends up pulling a heist that brings him in contact with Pym who has a job for Lang.Advertisement Pym is a giant (no pun intended -- really) in the Avengers comic book universe and the film treats the great scientists back story with the care it deserves. Douglas is commanding in the role and his chemistry with Rudd and Evangeline Lilly (who plays Pyms daughter Hope) provides the films strong framework. What doesnt work so well is Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket. As villains go hes about as subtle as an agitated Donald Trump. As Pyms former protege one would think hed be smart but hes more blunt bully than genius scientist with the intellect to compete with Pym.Fortunately hes overshadowed by the good guys including four varieties of ants that answer to Ant-Man. This movie will make you think twice before pulling out the Raid. Reed did his research and gave the insects real credibility as to what they can do physically and even gives them a little personality. Theyre vital to Ant-Mans mission to stop Cross from selling technology that could have grave consequences (are there any other kind of consequences in superhero movies?) for Earth. Ant-Mans ability to go from big to small to big again adds a new dimension to the action scenes and humor as well -- not surprising considering Rudd best known for his funny-guy roles and comedian Adam McKay both have writing credits. From Douglas occasional deadpan observations to Rudds ability to channel just the right slice of goofiness to the antics of Langs Three Stooges-like heist buddies (led by Michael Penas criminal Luis) the characters are very likable. And of course stay through the credits. But you probably knew that already.Like all great heroes Ant-Man arrives in the nick of time -- for an entire genre. Hes less chiseled and less godlike than other superheroes and refreshingly accessible. Hes kind of a regular guy and Rudd pulls off the part convincingly. If the public is in danger of burning out on superhero movies ""Ant-Man"" could become its true hero.Reach Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.Ant-Man    Rating PG-13 (for sci-fi action violence)Cast Paul Rudd Michael Douglas Evangeline Lilly Corey Stoll Michael PenaDirector Peyton ReedRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Ant-Man movie review A little Marvel hero and a lot to like about him - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Ant-Man review A little hero and a lot to like Ant-Man Marvel Studios/TNS Paul Rudd plays the role of Scott Lang a.k.a. Ant-Man in ""Ant-Man."" Paul Rudd plays the role of Scott Lang a.k.a. Ant-Man in ""Ant-Man."" (Marvel Studios/TNS) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Honey I shrunk the Rudd. An Ant-Man review. ""Ant-Man"" has been skittering around the development corridors of Hollywood so long the earliest unproduced screenplays about the tiny superhero actually preceded the Disney film ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids."" That was another age (1989) decades before our present Age of Ultron -- an epoch of expensive cheap thrills dictated by the steady crushing rollout of so many Marvel movies that even the good ones start to seem like ants at an endless picnic.But wait. The ""Ant-Man"" we have now before us half-an-inch tall and played by genial skillful Paul Rudd turns out to be better company than youd think possible in a multi-strand franchise lousy with corporate directives. The plots the same old thing. Mad mad mad mad science; imminent apocalypse; parent/child issues; blah blah blaggidy blah. The tone of ""Ant-Man"" however is relatively light and predominantly comic. Those who feel they need a break from the numbing destruction of the ""Avengers""/""Captain America"" movies will likely enjoy it.""Ant-Man"" is a frisky hybrid -- part ""Land of the Giants"" part heist film a la ""11 Harrowhouse"" but with Rudd leading an army of ants against the villain Yellowjacket played by the excellent character actor Corey Stoll. The set-up finds burglar Scott Lang (Rudd) getting released from three years in San Quentin. His ex-wife Maggie (Judy Greer never in a role big enough for her talent) has custody of their daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson). The stepfather figure in the girls life (Bobby Cannavale) is a sympathetic cop who doesnt like Langs rap sheet and wonders if hell continue his life of crime. Lang and his old pals (Michael Pena chief among them) learn of a safe inside a mansion belonging to some old rich crank just begging to be robbed. The crank is one Hank Pym (Michael Douglas solid if a little dull) whose big secret involves something called the Pym Particle. This enables humans to shrink down to ant size and then back up to human size in a flash. Pym targets Lang for the next phase of the experiment conducted with the surly but charismatic help of Pyms daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly). Ant-Man (Clip) Clip from ""Ant-Man"" The Suit Has Power (ScreenPlay) Clip from ""Ant-Man"" The Suit Has Power (ScreenPlay) See more videos The shrink gimmick of ""Ant-Man"" is simple and fetching. It may appeal to the younger segment of the Marvel audience more so than the jaded older teenagers and adults accustomed to wearying mass slaughter and entire cities being lifted up in the sky. The climactic smackdown between Rudd and Stoll takes place largely on a toy train set and when director Peyton Reed cuts away from the close-up action to longer shots the effect is very funny as if a pair of invisible preteens were knocking around a Thomas the Tank Engine happily.Well never know how much of what works in ""Ant-Man"" relates to the input of Edgar Wright (""Hot Fuzz"" ""The Worlds End"" ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"") the first director assigned to the movie. Reed (""Down with Love"") replaced Wright though Wright retains producer and co-screenwriting credit along with Joe Cornish. The second credited writing team Adam McKay and Paul Rudd presumably took things in a direction more pleasing to the Marvel folks while adding a few more jokes. Plus heart Cant forget the heart. Also theres a cameo from a back-bench ""Avengers"" superhero setting up Ant-Mans future screen appearances. Peyton Reed says hell show you how Ant-Man is cool Josh Rottenberg There are the superheroes everyone knows and loves the ones kids dress up as for Halloween the ones whose logos and square-jawed faces are emblazoned on everything from lunchboxes to dorm-room posters to tighty-whities. And then there is Ant-Man. The Marvel Comics hero -- whose suit enables him...

And then there is Ant-Man. The Marvel Comics hero -- whose suit enables him... (Josh Rottenberg) Time will tell whether a movie such as ""Ant-Man"" in which conventional firearms are so rewardingly irrelevant can find a big audience. But its more fun than ""Avengers 2.""

Ant-Man is the first Marvel film -- and the first of this summers pixels-go-kablooey time-wasters -- to get better as it goes. The filmmakers save their biggest wiggiest ideas for the climaxes where they wittily reduce the pageantry of destruction to HO scale In one of many third-act dustups our hero faces off against the latest Marvel tech-gone-wrong baddy on an architects model of a building. (It suffers the fate of Man of Steels Metropolis.)From there the action flits to even more humdrum locales intimate of-our-world spaces. This freshens up the usual superheroics. No spoilers here about the half-dozen surprises the filmmakers uncork in the last half-hour but isnt it a relief that once again there are marvels to spoil? I couldnt have spoiled the action in the Thor or Avengers sequels if I had tried Two hours in the digital villains were still gushing at us as if the CGI were coming from some faucet a kid had left running.Film Details Ant-Man RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time117 min. More Info Trailer Ant-Man by comparison makes a virtue of drought-year scarcity. The movie favors story over set pieces never even trying to dazzle us for a good 40 minutes -- and then heading back to hang out in a San Francisco Queen Anne owned by Ant-Man mentor Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Not that said story demanded to be told of course This is familiar superhero origin and training stuff spiced with heist-planning and the comedy of dumbfoundedness. As the goodhearted burglar who winds up with the powers to shrink himself and boss ants around Paul Rudd spends the first hour looking like neither he nor his character Scott Lang can buy that a guy like him could possibly be a hero. Maybe in the Marvel Cinematic Universe the entire history of Hollywood is different?Ant-Man is spry and often funny despite its familiarityDirected by Peyton Reed Ant-Man is spry and often funny despite its familiarity Just as in Jurassic World a few weeks back the villains here plan to militarize some priceless science fiction tech. If not quite the loose surprise of last summers Guardians of the Galaxy its blessedly free of gods-weep ponderousness. But its also uncentered in a way that Marvels origin films have never been. We see Lang become Ant-Man but learn too little about the more interesting man he was before that. In the first scene the not-yet-superpowered Lang is serving time for his brilliant burglaries of tech millionaires. The film makes clear that he held to some moral code in his thieving but doesnt bother sharing it or how he got to be celebrity enough that his arrest made the newspapers. His criminal acumen is simply a given like Captain Americas fightin spirit rather than a discipline the character once set himself to master.So Rudd has little to play. He shrugs through the long buildup a vague everyman schnook despite his good looks and mighty abs. (Early on in the name of product placement he runs a register at Baskin-Robbins when he clearly could be teaching spin and core classes.) Langs neither flip about superheroing nor especially into it -- he just seems relieved to have someplace to go and look a little annoyed. To make all this seem to matter Douglas playing inventor-cum-life coach has to keep speaking the heros motivation out loud ""Redemption.""Redemption of course is the idea that movies without ideas always pretend to be thinking about. Here it just means hes given the chance to perform feats of heroism in front of the family who moved on while he was incarcerated.Douglas guides Rudd and the film through the self-help paces teaching him to believe in himself and to boss ants around. Its mostly shot without distinction in the Marvel house style -- lots of drama in steel-and-concrete laboratories punctuated with stabs of pathos and pop culture. But that house style is effective especially when applied to time-tested formula and the mundanity lends power to the miracles. When we fly with Lang at last on the wings of carpenter ants over Coit Tower the film has the tingle of giddy possibility of Sam Raimis first Spider-Man.Ant-Man ends well and is sturdily built but theres rot at the margins. Judy Greer turns up as Langs ex-wife and the mother of his daughter the second time this summer this gifted actress has played a woman who worries while someone else has a blockbuster adventure. The best that can be said of all this At least they dont make her fall back in love with him.Evangeline Lilly plays Pyms daughter a martial-artist corporate exec who detests Lang on sight -- and wouldnt you know later finds much to admire. There might have been some satiric power in the fact that Lillys Hope van Dyne yearns to be a hero while the diffident Lang is simply given the role but the film doesnt dare take that on. Its no breakthrough that she gets to ask repeatedly why she cant be in the superhero suit or that Douglas as close to an official representative of the patriarchy as I can imagine has to take time from Langs adventures to address her complaints. But there is cause for encouragement Marvel wont make a woman the lead but the studio now feels obliged to pack its films with plot excuses as to why not.Meanwhile Langs crew of merry thieves finds strong non-white actors wasted as cowardly superstitious stereotypes. In his first scene Michael Pena has to report that his characters father has been deported -- and since this news means little to Lang its treated as a laugh. If this were an old-school talking-animal Disney cartoon Ant-Mans sidekicks would all be hyenas or something.For non-devotees of the comic-book film Ant-Man is decidedly a glass-half-empty situation. But fans wont care That glass is also half-awesome and thats enough.Directed by Peyton Reed. Written by Edgar Wright Joe Cornish Adam McKay and Paul Rudd.

How do Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy compare? For moviegoers whose knowledge of the Marvel universe doesnt extend to its second-tier pantheon of superheroes the thought of a microscopic do-gooder in a microscopic suit and mask may sound a bit well ridiculous. Neither super nor particularly heroic. But Peyton Reeds late-summer comic-book caper Ant-Man should uncock a lot of skeptically raised eyebrows. Watching Paul Rudd reduced to the size of a dust mite zipping around with his six-legged army of mind-controlled insects and sneaking into tight top-secret spots it suddenly makes sense why being tiny might be as advantageous as being the size of the Hulk. It helps of course that Rudd is the guy doing the selling. As Scott Lang a tech-savvy ex-con cat burglar tapped by brainiac inventor Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to stop his onetime-disciple-gone-bad (Corey Stoll) from duplicating his research and passing it along to HYDRA Rudd gooses the film to life with his scalpel-sharp comic timing and affable wiseguy charm. Like Chris Pratt hes smart enough to handle these films with a light touch or else fall prey to Marvels tendency to be morose and self-serious. Langs the kind of cut-up Tony Stark might be if he dialed back the smarm factor from an 11 to a 6. Still its a Marvel movie which means it runs on far too long. By the time the final Mission Impossible-style heist arrives my mind was drifting off to all of the unpredictably loopy and lunatic places original Ant-Man director Edgar Wright might have taken the films sluggish climax. Still thanks to Ant-Mans ace supporting cast (including Evangeline Lilly as Pyms estranged daughter and the scene-stealing Michael Pena as Langs excitably dim partner in crime) Reed and Rudds film is proof that no matter how silly some ideas sound at first good things often do come in small packages.

Put it this way The first action sequence in Ant-Man takes place in a bathtub. Ant-Man is ultimately too bland to leave much of an impression but at least its still a much-needed reminder that there are people underneath all that spandex. Based on a comic character that first appeared in 1962 Ant-Man tells the origin story of a sweet-natured thief named Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). Incapable of holding a job but determined to pay child support for his daughter Lang re-teams with his old crew (a trio fronted by the great Michael Pena). Their first score however is revealed to be a scheme concocted by scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Ousted from the company he founded after his particle--capable of reducing things to a fraction of their original size--was deemed too dangerous for mass consumption Hank needs a skilled but expendable stooge to break into his old lab and steal the research from his evil protege Darren Cross (Corey Stoll essentially channelling Jeff Bridgess bald villain from Iron Man). Rudds affable wit makes him a perfect choice for the part. But his performance is uncharacteristically inhibited as if he felt there was too much at stake to try something new. Even the jokes that do work leave some laughs on the table and the impulse to play things safe proves emblematic of a film that shrinks in the face of a challenge. While Ant-Man borrows from the likes of Inception and Oceans Eleven its heist elements are reduced to window-dressing. Director Peyton Reed--who replaced Shaun of the Deads Edgar Wright just weeks before shooting began--deserves credit for jumping aboard a speeding train but his inoffensive finished product proves that Marvel is more interested in protecting the house style than making great movies. Ironically it doesnt really matter if a superhero is big enough to punch Thor or small enough to squeeze through a keyhole When it comes to Marvel movies one size fits all.

""Check this guy out"" says The Flash (Dan Aykroyd). ""Hes got the strength of a human."" Several decades later Ant-Man still cant catch a break. Finally the star of his own big Marvel Cinematic Universe vehicle he gets stuck with the exceedingly pedestrian Peyton Reed in the directors chair taking over for Edgar Wright. Reeds ""Down with Love"" was a concept and some art direction in search of a movie and his ""Ant-Man"" serves up jokes that dont land and thrills that dont thrill. See Video Ant-Man Wants to Call the Avengers to Save the World in New Trailer (Video) Its always possible that the man behind ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"" might not have done any better since the screenplay -- credited to Wright and Joe Cornish (""Attack the Block"") and Adam McKay and star Paul Rudd -- relies upon a collection of Intro Screenwriting tropes that are thoroughly shopworn. Familiar notions like ""Doing This for My Daughter"" ""I Was a Distant Parent For My Childs Own Good"" and ""When Someone Says Dont Press That Button in Act One..."" get trotted out in a most listless fashion. Not that the other Marvel movies havent relied on familiar plot turns but ""Ant-Man"" doesnt provide enough dazzle camouflage to cover its tracks. The supposedly humorous sidekicks are grating the love interest (Evangeline Lilly in a Louise Brooks bob and matching power pantsuits) generates zero sparks and while the climactic battle spawns a memorable sight gag or two the emotional stakes are never such that the eventual big showdown will have anyone gripping their armrests. Even with four writers the movie never acknowledges that our hero and the other good guys allow a helicopter to crash-land in a heavily populated area. Not that this is the sort of movie to pay much attention to detail. We open in a flashback to 1989 where scientist Henry Pym (Michael Douglas digitally rejuvenated far more effectively than Jeff Bridges in ""Tron Legacy"" and less waxily than Arnold Schwarzenegger in ""Terminator Genisys"") leaves SHIELD and takes his ""Pym particle"" with him after a nefarious executive (Martin Donovan) plans to weaponize it. Cut to the present where Scott Lang (Rudd) is being released from San Quentin. Hes a cat burglar with a conscience -- he broke into a credit card companys computers to return money that had been gouged from its customers -- but hes still a convicted felon making it difficult for him to keep a job and to have joint custody of his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson ""Transparent""). Trying and failing to go straight Scott agrees to break into a house with a safe but when he cracks it he finds only a strange costume and helmet. Trying it on at home Scott presses a button in the glove and suddenly shrinks down to ant-size. Pym you see has set up the robbery to recruit Scott to break into Pyms old company and to steal a prototype of the Yellowjacket another shrinking weapons suit developed by Pyms former protege Darren Cross (Corey Stoll). Also Read Paul Rudds Tiny Ant-Man on Track for Giant Debut at Box Office Cue the learning-to-use-the-suit montage as Pym and his bristly daughter Hope (Lilly) put Scott through his paces eventually adding Scotts Three Stooge-ish friends (played by Michael Pena rapper T.I. and David Dastmalchian) to pull off the caper. To its credit ""Ant-Man"" isnt yet another movie where the fate of the entire world rests upon the outcome but the script could have used more personal stakes to counterbalance the relatively minor business of keeping the shrinky suits out of the hands of HYDRA. There are individual pieces of the movie that work wonderfully whether its Douglas performance (hes both dryly witty and convincingly bitter) or the execution of the heist on Pyms house (complete with 1970s wacka-chicka guitar riffs). Theres also a satisfying bit of ""Avengers"" crossover material that works on its own and not just as franchise-building. Unfortunately this is also the kind of movie where talented actors do some of their least notable work whether its Stolls Snidely Whiplash routine Pena overplaying the wackiness or Rudd having all of the charm and charisma stomped out of him. Also Read Marvels Ant-Man Resolves Writing Credit Dispute (Exclusive) Everything funny and mischievous about Rudd has been tamped down and turned into processed cheese here just like what ""Jurassic World"" did to Chris Pratt. (Speaking of which ""Ant-Man"" is the second movie this summer that takes the vibrant talented Judy Greer and wastes her as a fretting mom.) The preview audience around me hooted and hollered throughout particularly when there were any shout-outs to the other Marvel movie or TV properties so no doubt fans of the ""gotta-see-em-all"" bent will eat this one right up. As someone who has liked a majority of these Marvel adaptations I can only hope that ""Ant-Man"" represents a temporary dip thats not the beginning of a slippery slope.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be an awfully big noisy and repetitive place to spend your time and money but at its best it can also allow for humor whimsy and lightness of spirit -- all qualities that come into play in ""Ant-Man"" a winningly modest addition to the ever-expanding Disney/Marvel family. Though we can mourn the more stylish and inventive stand-alone caper we might have gotten from director Edgar Wright (who left the project over creative differences and was replaced by Peyton Reed) this enjoyably off-the-cuff franchise starter takes a cue from its incredible shrinking protagonist (played by a game Paul Rudd) and emerges with a smaller-scaled bigger-hearted origin story than most comicbook heroes are typically granted. Insofar as it feels like a bit of a tonic next to this summers more bloated offerings this July 17 Stateside release wont reach the box office heights of the recent ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" or last years chart-topping ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" But worldwide box office should nonetheless prove quite a picnic aided by 3D showings and solid word of mouth. Certainly Marvel devotees will swarm to this final entry in what the company has termed ""Phase Two"" of its ongoing and largely successful plot to colonize the known moviegoing universe. (For those not keeping track this phase began with ""Iron Man 3"" launched ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and included the sophomore installments of the Avengers Thor and Captain America franchises.) That sort of easy integration with the MCUs bigger better-known properties seems to be precisely what Wright was trying to avoid with his telling which he and writing partner Joe Cornish first pitched years ago well before ""Iron Man"" kicked off Phase One. And while Wright and Cornish retain story and screenplay credit (the latter shared with the rewriting team of Rudd and Adam McKay) their eventual parting of ways with Marvel stands as a sadly instructive example of what can happen to a talented filmmaker who dares to prioritize personal vision over studio synergy. Still whatever has been compromised by turning ""Ant-Man"" over to the director of ""Yes Man"" theres no denying that Reeds movie succeeds well enough as a genial diversion and sometimes a delightful one predicated on the rarely heeded Hollywood wisdom that less really can be more. After a brief 1989-set prologue introducing Dr. Hank Pym (a younger-looking digitally airbrushed Michael Douglas) a brilliant scientist whose particle research is highly coveted by the forces of S.H.I.E.L.D. the movie settles into a loose-and-casual vibe as it shifts to present-day Northern California where we first meet Scott Lang (Rudd) a skilled cat burglar whos just spent three years in San Quentin. Hes picked up by his old cellmate Luis (a scene-stealing Michael Pena) who tries to coax him back into a life of petty crime with his current associates (Tip ""T.I."" Harris and David Dastmalchian) but Scott is determined to go straight and reconnect with his young daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). That means paying child support to his disapproving ex Maggie (Judy Greer) whose cop fiance Paxton (Bobby Cannavale) doesnt think much of Scotts ability to turn over a new leaf. Paxton has a point as Scott is soon cracking a giant safe in someones basement where he finds a slightly battered-looking 60s-era black suit (the work of costume designer Sammy Sheldon Differ) and soon experiences its properties firsthand Not only can he shrink to the size of an ant but thanks to some miracle of atomic compression he also takes on cannonball strength and bullet speed. As it turns out both the basement and the suit belong to Hank who devised his shrinking technology years ago as a powerful U.S. military weapon (as we see advertised in a mock-propaganda film from decades earlier) but ultimately shelved it lest it fall into enemy hands. Now however Hank needs someone able and willing to don the suit again and he has settled on Scott whose impressive stealth agility and talent for thievery are just the skills Ant-Man needs. The requisite mid-movie training montage (niftily assembled by editors Dan Lebental and Colby Parker Jr.) finds Scott learning not only how to throw a punch and dive through keyholes but also how to communicate mentally with four different species of ants entire armies of which will eventually swarm forth to do his bidding. Putting their own spin on a subgenre defined by Jack Arnolds classic ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (1957) and later popularized by Disneys ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" (1989) Reed and his crew deftly orchestrate Ant-Mans shifts in size and the cameras subsequent fluctuations in p.o.v. and scale A splash of water in a bathtub becomes a veritable tsunami while a Thomas the Tank Engine train set triggers a railroad-hopping chase sequence straight out of an old Western complete with cutaways that place the action in amusingly tongue-in-cheek perspective. Less than convinced of Scotts ability -- and thus immediately establishing herself as a promising love interest -- is Hanks combative daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly rocking a pageboy) who would prefer to put on the suit and get the job done herself. That job it turns out will require Ant-Man to thwart the schemes of Hanks ambitious former student Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) whos getting dangerously close to replicating his old mentors technology in the form of a newfangled shrinking-suit technology called Yellowjacket with potentially disastrous results for a world still reeling from the cataclysms of ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" As readers of Stan Lees comics will know Dr. Hank Pym himself was a founding member of the Avengers (a fact that goes unmentioned here) and the very first incarnation of Ant-Man as we see in a brief flashback of him on an airborne mission with his equally shrink-tastic wife Janet Van Dyne (aka the Wasp). Janets absence in the present day goes some way toward explaining the nature of Hank and Hopes estrangement and their complicated father-daughter bond finds an obvious thematic echo in Scotts determination to do right by Cassie. These connections place ""Ant-Man"" in a classically Spielbergian world of single parents and broken marriages where the desire to protect ones child is a force as potent and primal as anything a mad scientist (or the Hulk) could hope to unleash. In some ways then ""Ant-Man"" feels less like a full-blown superhero spectacular than a goofily amusing warmly sentimental family drama with a pleasing overlay of blockbuster elements. (Its telling that this is the rare Marvel extravaganza where a house sustains serious damage rather than an entire city; elsewhere the films most significant location is the Pym family homestead lovingly mapped out by production designer Shepherd Frankel.) Some groundwork is laid for future Marvel cross-branding initiatives when Ant-Man must retrieve some crucial hardware from an Avengers base where he finds himself duking it out with Falcon (the always welcome Anthony Mackie). Beating an opponent of course is far less useful than remaining undetected in the first place and because Ant-Mans powers are a matter of precision and agility rather than technological ingenuity or brute strength the movie applies a similar economy and finesse. Notably the action centerpiece here is not just another bombastic save-the-world confrontation but rather a heist sequence that finds Ant-Man and his six-legged minions sneaking into Darrens laboratory. The vibe throughout is playful and unpretentious from the incorporation of a few upbeat Latin tracks by music supervisor Dave Jordan (with a particularly plot-specific use of ""La Cucharacha"") to the films nimble yet largely functional visual style though Reed does pull off one relatively eye-popping mind-bending sequence that immerses us in the dangerous effects of shrinking to subatomic levels. The refreshingly (and literally) down-to-earth scale of ""Ant-Man"" is largely a factor of Rudds charming performance as the nicest most boy-next-door cat burglar imaginable -- a most unlikely superhero who despite his newfound abilities and washboard abs refuses to take himself or his endeavors too seriously. Happily the Ant-Man helmet conveniently flips open allowing us regular access to the scruffy human face behind the red eye-shield and gas-mask-like protrusion (a fittingly 60s-era touch). Douglas supplies a wonderfully wry presence as a stubborn old father/mentor figure who regards both his daughter and his protege with affectionate exasperation and Stoll always a charismatic supporting player brings a marvelous tech-bro swagger to the role of the villainous Darren/Yellowjacket. John Slattery gets to reprise his ""Iron Man 2"" performance as Howard Stark in one scene while Martin Donovan proves suitably sinister in a more extended role as one of Starks less trustworthy S.H.I.E.L.D. colleagues. Yet the most memorable turn here may well come courtesy of Penas trusty sidekick Luis; with his aw-shucks grin and his charming habit of telling a story in the most digressive possible fashion he comes across as one infectiously happy dude who seems thrilled to have stumbled into a superhero movie. ""Ant-Man will return"" the films second end-credits stinger assures us and so long as he and his story remain as appealingly human-scaled as they are here it might be the rare Marvel kicker that legitimately gives us something to look forward to.

It looked cheap too. Lots of unremarkable interiors and close-ups. A very dull villain some confusing editing a clunky script - Ant Man is something to watch on a plane. Reply mahbawls says July 17 2015 at 1039 am Ant Man Flash Wonder Woman Lex Luther This films villain The writers of this and all Justice League movies The director of this and all Justice League movies 10 internet points if you can point out the hilarious common facet that were all supposed to be blind to. HINT the guy playing Batman was gifted an Oscar (its an award for causeheads) for making a propaganda film demonizing a 7 thousand year old culture who dont observe the answer as being superior to everyone else. It rhymes with lieonist. Reply D. G. Speirs says July 20 2015 at 913 am Nope. Nice try but nope. Swing and a miss guy. You see you can try and make this about you and your beliefs but its not. So if you want to talk about the merits of the film based on the technical structure - the performances the way the script is structured the technical aspects etc. - Imm be more than happy to listen perhaps even give your words credence. But instead you plan to spout meaningless words. Go away useless little person. Go find your little echo chamber and rant somewhere else. Because no one cares. Reply Lucky says July 9 2015 at 526 pm Great review And good to hear Pena is getting a good role hes been all over in the last couple years but hasnt really had a chance to really bring it Reply Kelly says July 9 2015 at 509 pm I will wait for it on Netflix ..but Im sure I will fall sleep watching it. Thanks Hollywood ; ) Reply Doctor Malcom says July 9 2015 at 153 pm Warner Bros. paid Variety to spoil the film...now I dont need to see this rubbish until it hits Red Box....sweeett Reply Bill B. says July 9 2015 at 1146 am Im through with Marvel movies for the most part as they are endlessly repetitive unoriginal and monotonously over the top but this much like Guardians last year offers something original and I suspect that this is going to be a bigger hit than this writer implies. Even I want to see it. Paul Rudd much like Chris Pratt is an extremely likable screen presence. Reply Andy Holloway says July 9 2015 at 423 pm try b-movieshaters. Reply Bea of FakeABaby says July 9 2015 at 749 am Indeed refreshing is the word D Reply Coach L. says July 9 2015 at 626 am I hear a big sucking-sound coming from underneath their theatres.

Reply Guest says July 8 2015 at 1128 pm This movie is getting a lot of good reviews. When I saw the trailer I was bit worried. But this probably going to be just like Guardians.

Reply David says July 8 2015 at 426 pm Does Stan Lee or anyone tied to this picture know this guys spoiling the entire film in his review??? Reply Adam says July 8 2015 at 402 pm If youre going to spoil parts of a movie no matter how trivial you may think those parts are at least put a spoiler alert to start the review off. Its actually embarrassing that you wouldnt even think to warn people that you would be spoiling plot points in here. You should seriously reconsider being a movie critic if you cant provide a review without letting the readers know that your piece contains spoilers. Reply Troubadour Russ says July 8 2015 at 359 pm Give me Hanna-Barbaras Atom Ant from the mid 60s thank you.Marvel please stop. Reply James says July 8 2015 at 301 pm Thanks for spoiling the film dick Reply Spider says July 8 2015 at 256 pm Damn Justin. I had no idea about the ""Avenger"" and ""Wasp"" cameos til I approached mid-spoiler-filled so-called review. I will no longer read your so-called reviews in the future. Reply Coach L. says July 8 2015 at 250 pm Its going to drop like a lead weight Reply Nahuel Benvenuto says July 8 2015 at 240 pm what if you write a review instead of just telling me the whole story of the movie? Reply jimmybing says July 8 2015 at 227 pm Fookin ell mate. Calm it with the spoilers. Reply Nanny Mo says July 8 2015 at 133 pm I feel like we have hit a new low here. Whats left Shazam? He was kind of super. Theres got to be someone in the Marvel / DC / Looney-verse that hasnt got a movie yet and there are so many over-paid stars still that need a second house. Reply Julia_Ormond says July 8 2015 at 1021 pm Ant-Man has been one of the longest-running characters in the Marvel Universe. He was basically a founding member of the Avengers and he predates Spider-Mans debut. Please stop talking. Reply PG says July 8 2015 at 456 pm Already in the works ) Reply Adam Singer says July 8 2015 at 131 pm Thats a lot of spoilers for a review. Reply Nanny Mo says July 8 2015 at 134 pm Im not sure you can ""spoil"" a movie about a super-hero half man ant. Reply Scott says July 8 2015 at 415 pm So you knew there was a Wasp cameo? You knew he found the suit by breaking into Hanks house? You knew he fights Falcon at an Avengers base? Those are spoilers if Ive ever seen em.

TWITTER Paul Rudd stars as the Marvel superhero in Peyton Reeds eagerly awaited sci-fi adventure. If you dont have Thors hammer Hulks bulk Captain Americas resolve or Iron Mans know-how whats an Avenger to do? The answer provided by Ant-Man is to go small smaller than Black Widows fingernail and exude a good sense of humor which is precisely what floats this latest addition to the Marvel cinematic firmament. The timing might even be fortuitous as far as the fan base is concerned what with the sense of overkill emanating from the most recent Avengers installment and a mirth quotient in the new outing that by Marvel standards ranks behind only that of the disarming Guardians of the Galaxy last summer. Although the story dynamics are fundamentally silly and the family stuff with its parallel father-daughter melodrama is elemental button-pushing a good cast led by a winning Paul Rudd puts the nonsense over in reasonably disarming fashion. The geek world even if it approves what has finally emerged onscreen will still always wonder what Ant-Man would have been like if as originally intended Edgar Wright he of Shaun of the Dead and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World cultish veneration had directed the screenplay he wrote with Joe Cornish. Would it have been more extreme irreverent idiosyncratic and in the end less Marvel-like? One can surmise that Rudd and his writing partner Adam McKay punched up the script with more humorous banter and character humor and Peyton Reed (Bring It On) has directed with energy neatly accommodating the assorted comic styles of Rudd and some of the supporting players most notably Michael Pena. But its usually interesting when an idiosyncratic talent like Wright gets involved with an existing franchise so the curiosity will always linger. In the sci-fi/fantasy domain human shrinkage has always occupied -- ahem -- a wee subgenre that has usually proven most effective when laced with humor. In this realm Hollywood has served up the likes of Dr. Cyclops The Incredible Shrinking Man Tom Thumb the short-lived Atom Ant cartoon series Fantastic Voyage Innerspace and Honey I Shrunk the Kids; no true classics among them but the format does force filmmakers to visualize the world from a very particular point of view. Read more Paul Rudd and Marvels Kevin Feige Reveal Ant-Mans Saga The most eye-catching perspectives here are the result of Rudds hapless ex-con Scott Lang trying on the nifty black-and-dark red Ant-Man costume for the first time. Accidentally turning himself tiny he must try to survive a quick tour that perilously includes a bathtub a dance club a thick carpet and the unwanted attentions of a mouse. Ant-Man can apparently endure any amount of being thrown around and buffeted against walls and floors but getting stepped on or eaten would not be good. How the luckless Scott happened to have greatness thrust upon him is the subject of a heavily expository first half-hour intermittently distinguished by a light-hearted approach. A table-setting 1989 opening has a 40ish-looking Michael Douglas (playing Dr. Hank Pym the man behind a revolutionary discovery called the Pym Particle) gravely announcing that ""As long as I am alive nobody is ever going to get that formula."" Arresting as this statement is its hard to pay attention to it while in the presence of a cinematic formula that has taken so many decades off Douglas looks that he could easily once again play the lead in Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct. (This arrives in the immediate wake of a similar computerized makeover that momentarily makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look years younger in Terminator Genisys.) But Dr. Pym -- who it might be noted also fathered Ultron in the comic book canon (in the films Ultron is created by Tony Stark with the help of Bruce Banner) -- is now a has-been having been pushed out of his own company by former protege Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) a gleefully malevolent aspiring supervillain who announces that a long-awaited final breakthrough in the science of miniaturization marks ""the end of warfare as we know it"" (and with this he is not proposing himself as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize). On the opposite end of the socioeconomic and good-luck scale is Scott who gets fired from Baskin-Robbins when his prison record becomes known and is kicked out of his young daughters birthday party by his ex-wife (Judy Greer) and her new beau (Bobby Cannavale). Scott reluctantly returns to a life of crime (but hes anti-violence mind you) and is soon rewarded with both the tight-fitting suit and the attention of Dr. Pym who has plans for the young man that include exacting revenge on Cross who now periodically appears in the guise of a predator called Yellowjacket and has his own notions about revolutionizing the world order. Read more Paul Rudds Ant-Man Could Hit Mighty 65M on July 17 Debut On the grand scale of all things Marvel the conflicts here seem extremely localized and personal rather than of global significance. Quite a few scenes take place within the brown confines of Pyms house and numerous others are set inside similarly cramped quarters such as a prison and Cross labs. The action set pieces sometimes feel weakly motivated invented just for spectacles sake and because the rhythm and expectations of the genre demand them. One particularly ridiculous flashback illustrates how Pyms wife gave her life to deactivate a Soviet ICBM in flight which is just one source of tension between Pym and his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) who has worked for Cross but helps her father and Scott thwart the rogue scientists nefarious plans. The modern comedy stuff comes off quite a bit better especially when Scott keeps company with his former prison buddy Luis (Pena) who continues to plot schemes his picky friend might find morally acceptable as well as other cohorts played by David Dastmalchian Tip T.I. Harris and Wood Harris; a couple of montages in which Luis humorous motor-mouthed storytelling is made to match up with pertinent characters lip movements are particularly effective. In fact the storys central conflict does not involve Scott/Ant-Man but rather Pym and his betrayer the aptly named Cross. For a presumably brilliant guy Cross acts stupidly and rashly when things are on the line and doesnt have the demented grand vision that a major villain should have (Ultron would have him for a snack). As if all too aware of this the writers have tried to compensate with comedy including a goofy bit in the combustible climax that actually brings Thomas the Tank Engine into the action. Having an actor of Douglas caliber on board lends the film some gravitas to balance the humor but its the comedy that prevails in a project that is in a historical sense integral to the Marvel map of the world but also seems rather on the margins of it.
