A fine lead cast of voices underlines its worth for buffs who will have their first chance to view it in Nov. 15 world premiere in L.A. with Budapest and other Hungarian screenings to follow. While it creaks along at times director Csaba Kaels new film version of a Hungarian opera masterpiece Ferenc Erkels ""Bank Ban"" is ultimately an invaluable entry in the opera-on-film library. Lensed by ace d.p. Vilmos Zsigmond in actual locales and on only one studio set pic about 13th century Hungarian court intrigues is conspicuously cinematic unlike many opera performances filmed or taped on stage. Its comparable to some of Werner Schroeters operatic explorations albeit far more conservatively conceived. A fine lead cast of voices underlines its worth for buffs who will have their first chance to view it in Nov. 15 world premiere in L.A. with Budapest and other Hungarian screenings to follow. Ancillary interest in niche market should be strong. Although this marks the third filming of Erkels frankly patriotic tragedy (including a silent Magyar version by Michael Curtiz) the opera itself remains rarely performed on the global circuit. Real value of Kaels version is its ability to record a fine reading of the work. ""Bank Bans"" Hungarian libretto by Beni Egressy (adapted by scripter Gabor Meszoly) set in the boisterous court of Endre the Second is in a lingo that fits comfortably with operatic sung form. While Endre (Kolos Kovats) is away the naughty will play especially Otto (Denes Gulyas) Endres brother and part of the power structure of the Meranians who have long dominated the Magyars in their own land. Otto plots to seduce Melinda (Andrea Rost) wife of Endres loyal Hungarian viceroy Bank Ban (Atilla Kiss B.). While Banks fiery brother Petur (Sandor Solymon-Nagy) tries to stir up Magyar resistance Bank -- chafing from his peoples plight yet still loyal to Endre -- initially refuses to join Peturs rebellion. However an errant knight and general peeping Tom named Biberach (Attila Reti) alerts Bank to Ottos sexual plans and this turns the viceroy to Peturs side. Soon the Magyars present Queen Gertrud (Eva Marton) with a challenge that ""the people are gathering arms."" In a series of intensely felt and sung duos among Kiss B.s Bank Dulyas Otto Rosts Melinda and Martons Gertrud that consume much of the second and third acts private emotions stand in for larger grander principles bringing to mind the personal shadings of Shakespeares history plays as well as the extreme behavior displayed in other mid-19th century Romantic works. Bank finally realizes in a burst of patriotic fury that Magyars must defend their name and the suggestion of Ottos rape of Melinda concludes the opera in a string of rising emotional confrontations. Tenor Kiss B. who smoothly balances the roles bold gruffness and a commitment to core personal values dominates throughout. Rost proves to be a powerful soprano of shattering range. The queens rigidity is made particularly solid by the compact force of mezzo-soprano Marton while tenor Gulyas and baritones Solymon-Nagy and Reti add considerable color in vivid supporting roles. Blatantly uneven pre-recording of voices mars all perfs. The artificial effect unfortunately distances auds from the works emotional strengths further compounded by Kaels direction which is far better in the lengthy duo scenes than in the hackneyed group passages. Coverage of many Hungarian architectural locations is outstanding. Zsigmonds surprising decision to use lots of filters in his lensing produces a muted deflating effect however that works against the operas emotional heat. Conductor Tamas Pal leads an energetic enthralling Hungarian Orchestra of the Millennium. Bank BanHungary ProductionA Bunyik Entertainment release (in U.S.) of an Ezusthajo Prods.

Hilary Duff plays a scientists daughter in ""Agent Cody Banks."" Uneasy laughter / Amusing teen spy comedy Cody Banks strikes some disturbing notes 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Agent Cody Banks Comedy. Starring Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff. Directed by Harald Zwart. (PG. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Agent Cody Banks"" is an entertaining film for kids and young teens. Its also a product of the era in which were living and weird times make for weird movies. Its a romance about two prep school kids in their early teens a jolly frolic set against a background of world terrorism. Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz of TVs ""Malcolm in the Middle"") is both an awkward kid who freezes up whenever he talks to girls and a junior CIA agent charged with protecting the entire military arsenal of the United States from terrorist agents. Throughout the movie everybody is smiling and happy -- but why? So ""Agent Cody Banks"" is both enjoyable and unintentionally creepy. Take for example the scene in which our young hero is called up to active duty and brought to CIA headquarters. Without any of the healthy irony that usually characterizes the American attitude toward authority Cody is told ""You will speak only when spoken to. You will follow orders without question."" This in a comedy. The scene is reminiscent of the kind of thing once seen in Stalinist musicals in which people merrily sang and danced about the glories of tractors factory work and the latest five-year plan. We might expect that from a totalitarian society but when a U.S. film directed at kids starts assuring us that its possible to simultaneously have a boot in your face and a smile on your face its at least worth noticing. Cody is transferred to a new prep school and assigned to get close very close to the prettiest and most popular girl in the school Natalie (Hilary Duff). Her father (Martin Donovan) is a scientist and the government needs to know about the work hes doing for some shady international characters. In a story sense the premise is nonsensical because the government already knows all it needs to know. But in a psychological sense the premise is perfect. Every 15-year-old boy believes that if he cant get the girl of his dreams the world will come to an end. In ""Agent Cody Banks"" the boy just happens to be right. The prospect of geopolitical calamity lends an extra edge of urgency to the boy-meets-girl stuff. What bad luck. The agent is a nerd and the scientists daughter just happens to be beautiful. This is where ""Agent Cody Banks"" is at its best and funniest. With the help of a cadre of secret agents Cody keeps trying to worm his way into Natalies esteem while she remains put off and mystified by this stammering stranger. So long as it focuses on the personal the picture remains amusing but in the last third its as if someone remembered the box office success of the ""Spy Kids"" movies. The movie stops relying on the comic abilities of its engaging young co-stars and gets bogged down in gadgetry. The pace is drawn out. We start seeing bad processed shots of things like Cody skiing on a jet- propelled snowboard and all novelty and momentum are lost. Still ""Agent Cody Banks"" is never bad just odd and may it remain ever so. Indeed thats whats especially unsettling about the film watching without knowing whether the movie is a manifestation of some temporary societal neurosis or something future audiences will consider normal. This film contains scenes of danger and murder.

RELATED STORIES Tweens love romance Hollywood is turning out romantic comedies for younger audiences Eight actors in the mood for love Suave sweet silly Cody BanksBy Claudia Puig USA TODAY As fantasies go this one is pretty classic Ordinary teenage boy gets recruited by the CIA to save the world and date his dream girl. Frankie Muniz plays a 15-year-old boy who goes undercover for the CIA drives a cool car and rescues (and falls for) a pretty girl. By Diyah Pera AP In fact the teenager has trained for several summers learning top-secret maneuvers in a facility disguised as a summer camp. Agent Cody Banks has this fairly winning (if familiar) premise and features one of the more likable young actors around Frankie Muniz of Malcolm in the Middle who has an endearing blend of self-deprecation innocence and smarts that works well here. More on the movies Agent Cody Banks (out of four) Stars Frankie Muniz Hilary Duff Angie Harmon Director Harald Zwart Distributor MGM Rating PG for action violence mild language and some sensual content Opens today nationwide Munizs Cody drives a sleek Ferrari like a stuntman and nimbly eludes high-tech sensors while spying in a remote lab. But he still must do his chores and face ridicule when he becomes tongue-tied around girls. His co-star Hilary Duff the perky and popular star of the Disney Channels Lizzie McGuire is Natalie the object of his affections. The pair has a nice chemistry with an appropriately tame romance for a couple of teens. The movie starts with a bang as Cody saves the life of a toddler in a runaway car. Then he is given his first assignment by the CIA chief (Keith David in a funny turn). Codys mission is to attend every class with Natalie -- the daughter of a brilliant scientist -- and befriend her in order to spy on her dad (Martin Donovan) the creator of a fleet of microscopic robots which bad guys plan to use for nefarious purposes. Natalie gets kidnapped during their first official date. On his quest to find her Cody careens down perilous slopes on a turbo-powered snowboard pilots a racing snowmobile and flies solo in a helicopter-like device. As thrilling as the adventure sequences might be for kids the better scenes take place on the high school campus where he takes the imposing drivers-ed instructor on the ride of his life and at a birthday party at Natalies house where Cody uses his impressive martial-arts skills to fend off bullies. In the background is an adult assigned as Codys ""handler."" Ronica (Angie Harmon) is an intimidating and ultra-efficient Bond-girl type who eventually evolves into a good-hearted partner. Harmon is a surprisingly effective comedian in a performance thats both sexy and maternal. A few quirky segments (perhaps contributions by the unlikely writing team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski who created the clever Ed Wood) spare the high-concept Cody Banks from feeling as if it were conceived and created by marketers. But extended explosions during a climactic scene seem numbingly endless and the villains (Ian McShane and Arnold Vosloo) might as well be cardboard cutouts. Combine the cool gadgetry and exciting special effects of Die Another Day with the derring-do of Spy Kids spice it up with a little comedy and romance and you get a movie to delight tweens the 9- to 12-year-old demographic that is Hollywoods current darling.

As 15-year-old CIA trainee Banks Frankie Muniz gamely zooms through a ""Matrix""-ized variation on his ""Malcolm in the Middle"" persona. Codys wide-eyed exhilaration at his first assignment - snuggling up to the daughter (Hilary Duff) of a scientist whose creations threaten the world - contrasts nicely with the anhedonic antics of such ""adult"" entertainments as ""XXX."" The real mission is product placement of course The movie seems to be set against the silvery backdrop of the Sharper Image catalog. And one has to wonder whether tutoring tweens in the objectification of women (including Angie Harmon as Codys den mother-cum-dominatrix boss) is acceptable collateral damage.

Pic is a lot more enjoyable than most of what passes as youth-aimed entertainment nowadays. Modestly budgeted item could reap a profit and perhaps lead to a franchise for hit-starved MGM. ""Agent Cody Banks"" is a pint-sized James Bond-style adventure that might have been co-produced by the CIA and the extreme-sporting-goods industry. Yet as crass as it is product placement-heavy pic wants to engage youthful imaginations rather than just pacify them and is a lot more enjoyable -- for adults as well as kids -- than most of what passes as youth-aimed entertainment nowadays. Moreover as a spy pic it has more pizzazz than the last few Bond adventures ""The Sum of All Fears"" or ""The Recruit"" (to which it bears a particular resemblance). Modestly budgeted item which boasts a credits-busting 14 producers could reap a tidy profit and perhaps even lead to a franchise for hit-starved MGM. Connect-the-dots plot has nefarious villain (amusingly played by Ian McShane in a mini-reprise of his ""Sexy Beast"" character) exploiting the talents of unsuspecting well-meaning scientist-type (Tate Donovan) to further an agenda of world domination. In the last Bond pic the villain housed his operation in a giant ice palace; here ice itself is the weapon of choice -- ice cubes to be exact containing frozen micro-organisms capable of destroying any substance with which they come into contact. Once the scientist learns his project will be used to sinister intent he tries to back out (though you have to wonder what non-sinister application he could have imagined for these ferocious little creatures). Only the threat of harm to his teenage daughter Natalie (Hillary Duff) keeps him working. Enter the CIA and the diminutive agent of pics title. Engagingly played by ""Malcolm in the Middle"" star Frankie Muniz Cody is a hip-to-be-square Seattle high-schooler recruited by the CIA while attending a summer camp that was actually a ""junior agent"" training facility in disguise. Hesa stereotypical nerdily cool computer-whiz whos got all the right moves (pic opens with a spirited sequence in which Cody speeds through downtown traffic on his skateboard to rescue a baby trapped in a runaway car) except when it comes to girls. Of course his first CIA mission is to ingratiate himself with Natalie as a way of getting to her father. And before its all over Cody will actually fall for Natalie risk blowing his cover and reveal his true identity to her at a particularly inopportune moment. Screenplay (credited to Ashley Edward Miller Zack Stentz Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski from a story by Jeffrey Jurgensen) is quick and clever enough to realize how deadening these spy antics can be and doesnt dwell on them. Marking a return for Alexander and Karaszewski to family-film writing the movie has some of the anarchic snap of the ""Problem Child"" pics that launched their careers. At its best ""Agent Cody Banks"" is ripe with a sense of adolescent boys heroism fantasies -- its like a brasher less elegant ""Spider-Man"" -- and because some boys never outgrow such fantasies pic will carry a certain appeal for adults.The movie also has a throwback male-chauvinist sensibility like the James Coburn ""Flint"" films and theres something oddly refreshing about the way pic keeps Natalie firmly in damsel-in-distress territory while allowing Cody to woo her with his martial-arts prowess and other derring-do. This is the anti-""Charlies Angels.""Despite its many riffs on Bond et al. ""Agent Cody Banks"" never becomes a full-on parody in the ""Austin Powers"" sense; nor does it reach the level of Richard Franklins superb 1984 ""Cloak amp; Dagger"" about a kid embroiled in a real espionage drama. While charming ""Lizzy McGuire"" star Duff is sidelined with little to do much of the time. The adult actors (who include the wonderful Arnold Vosloo as McShanes chief henchman Keith David as the larger-than-life CIA director and the very sexy Angie Harmon as Codys CIA ""handler"") play things more straight than campy and the movies young Norwegian director Harald Zwart (""One Night at McCools"") stages the action as though he were making a high-end thriller. The movie is bigger on stunts and action (with the help of veteran second unit director Terry Leonard whose work includes the Jack Ryan movies) than digital effects and most important -- and unlike the increasingly flabby Bond pics -- it moves right along with editing by Jim Miller). Other tech contributions are proficient if undistinguished. Not unexpectedly Vancouver stands in for Seattle in pics location shooting.
