Hes the kind of guy whod rather narrowly avoid rush-hour sideswipes than submit to suit-and-tie spiritual oblivion. His sixth sense for avoiding close calls with taxicabs pedestrians and other potentially life-ending obstacles is near Jedi levels. But this hipster Padawan faces his greatest challenge after being tasked with the Columbia University-to-Chinatown delivery of a hot-potato envelope that a crooked cop (Michael Shannon) will stop at nothing to get his hands on. Spielberg house screenwriter turned occasional director David Koepp (Stir of Echos Ghost Town) has tons of fun tricking out this relentlessly paced B-movie. All the stunts have a tangible physicality--Wilees multilevel escape from a police storage compound is an especially exhilarating set piece--while most of the digital effects are reserved for inventive Google Maps-meets-Grand Theft Auto asides that hilariously illustrate our heros peril-avoiding thought process. As long as Koepp keeps the focus on his two leads the good times are infectious Gordon-Levitt pedals with ingratiating Wild One attitude and Shannon adds another indelible characterization to his rogues gallery of bug-eyed lunatics. But after the story takes a cloyingly sentimental turn this lean-and-mean thriller becomes bathetically bloated. Just a few spokes short of a wheel guys.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Review Premium Rush delivers action no bells and whistlesBy Tom Charity Special to CNNUpdated 1209 PM ET Fri August 24 2012 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Joseph Gordon-Levitt races through the streets of Manhattan as Wilee in ""Premium Rush.""Story highlights""Premium Rush"" is centered around a group of New York bike messengersJoseph Gordon-Levits character Wilee appears to have a bit of a death wishThere is also a romantic subplot involving Wilee and another of the bikersFor some reason moviemakers havent been falling over themselves to glorify the exciting and heroic lives of bike messengers -- which at least leaves director David Koepp with a clear field. And if its a two-wheeled pedal-powered adrenaline charge youre after this is definitely the movie to watch. Yes the plot is contrived and stretched much too thin. Yes the characters are strictly off the peg. And yes this flick is essentially a one-trick pony.But at least its something different. ""Premium Rush"" is loaded with on-road action scarcely pausing for breath as courier Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) criss-crosses Manhattan on his austere steel-frame fixed-gear no-brakes bone-rattler. Wilee takes his handle from the Coyote but hes got more in common with Road Runner zipping through the citys canyons slaloming around cabs and pedestrians oblivious to red lights and traffic regulations. Gordon-Levitts an attractive and engaging actor but motorists may find it challenging to overlook this guys reckless and self-centered road sense which is dressed up here as your typical Zen-existential-death-wish trip. The Coyote role -- one Robert Monday -- falls to Hollywoods current go-to crazy Michael Shannon (""Take Shelter"" ""Boardwalk Empire"") who sucks up all the juiciest dialogue as a guy with impulse control issues. Hes after an envelope that Wilee is delivering downtown -- it really doesnt matter why -- and hes not going to take no for an answer. Frankly Id have liked to have spent more time with this unhinged brother to the ""Bad Lieutenant."" I mean who didnt wish the Coyote got his bird just once? Koepp who also wrote the screenplay with John Kamps ramps up the velocity with low camera angles speeded-up photography and a rag-bag of digital add-ons. Wilee plots intersections with a kind of mental Streetview calculating potential wipeouts and collisions like Sherlock Holmes armed with a GPS. This souped-up visual gimmickry is eye-catching but as empty and artificial as Koepps story which skates over several glaring coincidences and absurdities on what must be the unluckiest day in Wilees life. It doesnt have to be ""Bicycle Thieves"" but a more nuts and bolts approach to physical reality wouldnt have hurt fewer impossible jumps more hard landings. I can readily believe that a cyclist could stay a step ahead of a car on Manhattans crowded streets -- just as well as the movie is essentially a series of long chase scenes stuck end to end - but a modicum of consistency would be nice. One minute Wilee is racing hell for leather to evade a bike cop; the next hes parking outside a police station to report the bug-eyed motorist trying to turn him into roadkill. Probably to satisfy the moneymen and maybe to spin out his slim 75-minute story to an hour and a half Koepp also throws in a romantic subplot. Its an unnecessary distraction from the business at hand. Koepp shifts backward and forward in time when it suits him but altogether too much of the romantic sparring takes place on the hands-free as Wilee and Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) hurtle in different directions. Trust me That heavy breathing you hear has nothing to do with sex. An unpretentious throwback to the kind of action movie that had no need of superheroes ""Premium Rush"" is hardly a classic but fun up to a point and its a B movie for gearheads with no bells and whistles.

Theres little in the way of fancy subtexts or allegorical overtones and no shocking final twist in which say the kidnapped damsel turns out to be a homicidal maniac. (There is no kidnapped damsel.) The package needing delivery by the bicycle messenger protagonist (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a generic MacGuffin (Dont screw up calls the dispatcher. Its premium rush); and the bad guy trying to take it from him a cop (Michael Shannon) with a frightful gambling problem represents no faction or entity larger than himself. Inevitably there are characters other than the chaser and the one being chased but there hardly need to be. Manhattan has enough pedestrians drivers and other bicyclists to fill the screen for a fast 90 minutes. Gordon-Levitts Wilee does have a life philosophy but its nothing terribly complex. Cant work in an office he says in voice-over while evading numerous potentially deadly obstacles. Cant stop Dont want to either When I see a guy in a gray business suit my balls shrivel up. Zooming through red lights and teeming crosswalks he is exactly the kind of biker to whom we yell We have a walk sign asshole But being as were seeing the world through his eyes we think Out of the way assholes I must say that this cuts to the heart of New Yorkers moral relativism On bikes they think Asshole pedestrians and Asshole drivers In cars they think Asshole pedestrians and Asshole bikers On foot they think Asshole bikers and Asshole drivers (Wherever they are of course they think Asshole critics)Director and co-screenwriter David Koepp understands that chase thrillers and farces are sibling-close and he deftly orchestrates roundelay in and around a precinct house featuring Wilee Bobby Monday (Shannon) and a pissed-off bicycle cop. Theres a wizardly CGI gimmick that tops the one in those lousy Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes pictures Our hero forced to make split-second decisions at busy crosswalks calculates the outcome of various routes most of which are lethal and end in the hellish mangling of either Wilee or a random bystander. In addition to evoking the cyberlike workings of the modern young brain the device gives new meaning to the phrase The road not taken.To deliver his package Wilee needs to get from 116th Street to Doyers the adorable curvy lane in Chinatown that is here home to both restaurants and Chinese gambling dens. To make certain we have our larger geographical bearings Koepp regularly cuts to a grid of Manhattan on which a fat white line displays Wilees trajectory. To make certain we have our larger narrative bearings Koepp uses an onscreen digital clock when flashing back to earlier in the very bad day of Bobby Monday. Good as Gordon-Levitt is (theres no fat on him  or his acting) its Shannon who earns most of our sympathy. His Monday is so very lumbering and hapless. His face is ravaged his eyes bug out and when he thinks he has the upper hand he emits a girlish Hee-hee that inevitably transforms into a howl of pain. Shannon is a great stage actor (his plaintive Astrov in the Soho Rep Uncle Vanya is the finest Ive ever seen) and his performance here is stylized to the point of being cartoonlike  but without a trace of camp. Seeing his Astrov and his Monday back to back I cant help putting them together and imagining something really really big  the best Macbeth of his generation? -- David Edelstein Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick Jon Stewartas New HBO Show Will Be Animated and Onion-Like Divorce Insecure and Westworld Get Fall Premiere Dates on HBO The Larry Sanders Show Is Coming to HBO Streaming Outlets in September TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

That applies to Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a fixie-riding bike courier Wilee in this wildly fun New York chase movie amber-gambling doesnt begin to describe his riding style. The idea behind the film is genius. Who watches a city car chase in a movie and buys it? (The average traffic speed in central London is 10mph). But on a bike now youre talking.Premium Rush runs on adrenaline rather than plot. Wilee has an envelope to deliver and a bad guy (Michael Shannon channelling Harvey Keitel) wants to stop him. Its fast and furious. Cyclists youll be watching with your hands over your face as Wilee bounces off opening taxi doors. Gordon-Levitt is terrific two parts charm to one part cocky king of the road. And the action scenes hum because they look real performed by stuntmen riding real bikes on real streets - including a knockout turn by Scottish cyclist Danny MacAskill (look him up immediately on YouTube if youve never seen him in action). A blast.

"Premium Rush | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; premium-rush ) Premium Rush (United States 2012) August 24 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli It comes as a bit of a surprise that for consistently suspenseful chase sequences the pick of the 2012 summer crop is the under-the-radar thriller from writer/director David Koepp Premium Rush. The average chase filmed with the traditional selection of shots is often so staid as to be sleep-inducing. Content has something to do with why Premium Rush percolates with tension we havent thus far been inundated with scenes of high-speed bicycles weaving in and out of traffic in Manhattan. But Koepps direction deserves credit as well. He varies the way the chases are shown without ever going shaky-cam on us. We are treated to mid-range shots overhead shots and point-of-view shots. There are clever moments in which glimpses are provided of accident-avoiding ""alternatives."" Cut left and a pedestrian would be hit. Go right and a baby stroller would be hit. But swerve around a car stopped in the middle of an intersection and it will be clear sailing. The movie speeds along crisply providing just enough exposition to lend a few pounds of emotional weight without bogging down the breakneck pace. Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the best of New York Citys bicycle messengers. Hes the guy you call when FedEx isnt fast enough. He uses a GPS but usually doesnt need it. He flies through the streets with abandon swerving in and out of traffic occasionally causing accidents and putting himself at constant risk of death or injury. His bicycle has neither gears nor brakes. He doesnt coast; he peddles. Hes not the only one on the streets delivering letters at 30 apiece. His on-again off-again girlfriend Vanessa (Diana Ramirez) is a messenger as well as is too-cool-for-school Manny (Wole Parks). Their lives are dangerous enough without the problem theyre about to face. Vanessas roommate Nima (Jamie Chung) is trying to smuggle her young son out of China. In order to do so she needs a ticket to be delivered to a woman in Chinatown before 7 pm. Who better to do this than Wilee. But the ticket is worth a lot of money and a crooked cop Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon) needs it to clear his gambling debts. When ""gentle"" tactics dont work he starts to get rough. This leads to one of the films most innovate chase scenes with Mondays car trying to overtake Wilees bike. It becomes apparent that while cars are bigger meaner and faster theyre not always the best when it comes to navigating the traffic clogged streets of Manhattan at rush hour. Koepp uses an economical storytelling method relying on quick flashbacks to fill in the details. Theres never an instance when more than a few minutes passes without some kind of action scene. A combination of daredevil activity by the actors (Joseph Gordon-Levitt reportedly ended up with more than 30 stitches after one incident) expert stunt drivers and CGI creates the illusion that these characters are doing some very dangerous things. Its all based (loosely) on fact In New York if youre a pedestrian the two things of which you must be the most aware are the taxis and the bicycle messengers. Koepp is better known in Hollywood circles for A-list screenplays Jurassic Park War of the Worlds and so forth. His directorial efforts have been smaller but never uninteresting. They include The Trigger Effect Stir of Echoes and Secret Window. Premium Rush provides him with another respectable title to add to his resume. Two top-notch performances anchor Premium Rush. The first belongs to Joseph Gordon-Levitt whose Hollywood stock has risen dramatically in the past few years as he has shown the ability to be a dorky romantic lead (500 Days of Summer) a cancer patient (50/50) and an action hero (The Dark Knight Rises). He does a lot with a little here not only anchoring a number of chase scenes but helping to cement the films gooey emotional core. Meanwhile Michael Shannon enjoys himself immensely playing a deliciously detestable bad guy. He never tries to be remotely sympathetic; hes a sleaze and a badass and he knows it. He also provides some of Premium Rushs most darkly comedic moments. This movie is not without its laughs. The most difficult challenge for Columbia Pictures is marketing the film but the seemingly obscure premise should not be a deterrent to seeing this because unlike many of the summers biggest offerings this one delivers. And in the end little else matters.

Happily exuberant bike-messenger-chase-film extravaganza Premium Rush makes the actors lightweight streamlined frame an attribute rather than a liability emphasizing propulsion over punch. After picking up a valuable envelope from Columbia Universitys campus JGLs fixed-gear messenger Wilee is tailed by a psychopath in a Mazda trying to run him down. ""Wile E.? Like the coyote?"" asks Michael Shannons crooked cop--the pieces heavy--falling right in with the movies cartoon concept popping out his eyes while displaying an undervalued comic ability between moments of genuine pathos. Director David Koepp follows the action up and down the length of Manhattan and--with a sinuously mobile camera--through rush-hour traffic while showing a respectful know-how of the citys geography in catching the 28th Street flower vendors and the elbow angle of Chinatowns Doyer Street. There is a lot of silly bike-is-life philosophy including Wilees personal credo of ""Fixed gear steel frame no brakes"" none of which I can speak to because I dont care a tinkers damn about bikes but I do have an abiding fondness for compact and coherent action movies and this is surely one.Film Details Premium Rush RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time91 More Info Trailer Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Sony I believe the world can be divided into three distinct populations bike messengers; people who have never shared a road with bike messengers; and people who have done so and as a result cant stand bike messengers. Given the size of this final cohort it was an act of some bravery for the filmmakers behind Premium Rush to make their hero yes a bike messenger. The ugly reminders are all right up there on the screen the mortal swerves amid traffic the red lights run the multi-car pileups initiated the routine terrorization of motorists and pedestrians alike. MORE ON FILM The Wrong Opinions About Do the Right Thing When Tony Scott Was at His Best What Beasts of the Southern Wild Really Says Movies Should Scare Kids The Greatest Films Ever Includes Nothing From the Past 40 Years? Of course unlike the bike messenger in question none of these innocent bystanders is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt so hes got that going for him. Gordon-Levitt stars as Wilee--nicknamed inevitably ""the coyote""--a twentysomething whose choice of profession current unemployment figures notwithstanding is a consequence of enthusiasm not necessity. A graduate of Columbia Law School Wilee has nonetheless eschewed the bar in favor of the bike--specifically a stripped down fixed-gear steel frame with no brakes. (He argues that they cause more accidents than they prevent; I can only hope that the attorneys at Columbia Pictures are well prepared for a future class-action suit.) Co-written and directed by screenplay superstar David Koepp Premium Rush is slight to the point of evanescence. Wiley is given an envelope to deliver that is More Than It Seems and winds up being chased around Manhattan by a dirty cop (Michael Shannon) who wants its contents. Thrown into the mix are a bike-messenger ex-girlfriend (Dania Ramirez) a bike-messenger competitor for her affections (Wole Parks) a bike-cop (Christopher Place) a Columbia student with a secret (Jamie Chung) and a couple of Chinese gangsters.As cited in the film the term ""premium rush"" is shorthand for an especially well-compensated delivery. But the primary purposes of the title seem to be to advertise Wilees adrenal addiction to urban biking to hope that we will share his zeal and to invite intellectual-property lawsuits. Judged against its modest ambitions the movie is successful in a straightforward middle-concept Cellular kind of way. Like that early Chris Evans vehicle Premium Rush doesnt aim terribly high but manages to hit its marks with reasonable accuracy. Gordon-Levitt is his typical likable self. Shannon plays a villain more pitiable than frightening a compulsive gambler who sneers and whinges his way through the film in a nasal vaguely Cagneyesque tenor. And there are many many scenes of people riding bicycles with extreme prejudice. Arguably best of all the movie completes its delivery in a swift 91 minutes. Throwing ""premium"" into the title may be overselling such a trifling entertainment. But for the cinematically discounted days of late summer its a perfectly diverting little ride.

Twitter previousTrack of the Day The WarpathnextStudy Fish Play Video Game Tell Us to Be Social Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Its a good thing that adrenaline tends to short-circuit logical thinking; the plot is mostly nonsensical but youll be too thrilled by the literal twists and turns to care much. As stories go this ones pretty basic Wiley picks up an envelope at NYU and has to deliver it to Chinatown by 7 p.m. Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon) wants to take that envelope from him. And ... go Granted the screenplay (by John Kamps and director David Koepp) fills in the blanks jumping backward from the perspective of various different characters letting us know why Wiley made the pickup whats in the envelope why Monday wants it so desperately and so on. (They also throw in a nifty running gag about legendary horror-movie champion Forrest J. Ackerman.) Not that any of that ultimately matters all that much even though it does give Shannon the opportunity to chew the scenery with gusto. This is a live-action Road Runner cartoon transplanted from the desert to the city. Which is not to say that ""Premium Rush"" isnt a blast to watch from Wileys split-second reflexes (at certain intersections we see diagrams of how his various choice of routes could end up) to his no-holds-barred race through Central Park with rival courier Manny (Wole Parks) with NYPD bike cops in hot pursuit to the literal ticking clock that periodically pops up on screen. Apart from Shannon theres not a lot of room for acting here but Koepp keeps his performers (and no doubt a hardy crew of doubles) going at full speed. Wiley mentions on several occasions that his bike has no brakes and neither does the movie which pedals as fast as it can. With cinematographer Mitchell Amundsen (a vet of everything from ""Bourne"" to ""Transformers"" to that Jonas Brothers 3D concert movie) and legendary production designer Therese DePrez on hand the film makes New York simultaneously gleaming and treacherous. In addition to Wileys multiple-outcome-vision the movies other neat trick is to periodically cut to a 3D map of New York with swooshing yellow lines showing us where the characters are and where theyre headed intercut with satellite photos and Google Earth-type pictures of their destinations. ""Premium Rush"" may well be the first movie designed to eventually be watched on your phone but its visual moxie merits a look while its still on the big screen. And at 91 minutes its smart enough not to wear out its welcome. Its not a bike tour where youll linger on the details or learn anything about the local sights but youll enjoy feeling the wind in your face as you go careening downhill without much in the way of plot or character to weigh you down.

Ben-Hur staged a chariot race as Biblical demolition derby Speed got virtuoso mileage out of a runaway bus and now director David Koepp has come up with the novel notion of setting an all-too-standard underworld potboiler among the bad-boy community of New York City bike messengers. As anyone who lives in New York (or has even visited for a day) knows well bike messengers are those low-tech daredevils in brightly colored spandex whose job it is to zip through the gnarled clusters of Manhattan traffic at often irresponsible speeds. Thats whats annoying about them but also funny and halfway admirable A certain recklessness is built right into their job description. (If they were any less swift then they wouldnt be of much value.) The hero of Premium Rush is of course a messenger who is faster cockier and more fearless than anyone else. His name is Wilee (pronounced ""Wylie"" -- yes its a reference to Wile E. Coyote). Hes played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt with a fast-break energy and dash that shows off just how much the actor is enjoying evolving into a movie star. Of all the requirements of stardom one of them is surely that if youre going to take on a role like this you need to radiate a sense of down-and-dirty fun. Gordon-Levitt does. The movie is basically Top Gun on bike wheels and Wilee is the Maverick character the rebel who rides a stripped-down cycle thats equipped with no gears and no brakes (""Brakes are death"" is his breathless motto). Hes also a law-school graduate who prides himself on not having an office job on staying outside the system. Koepp shoots the zipping-through-traffic scenes with a sharply angled excitement keeping the camera low to the ground Mad Max-style and always letting you know where every car and crosswalk is. The precision of his staging is what gives the action its kick. (In a rare case of spatial fidelity the film even respects the geography of Manhattan.) The plot however is just a rote high-speed MacGuffin. Wilee heads up to the campus of Columbia University where his ex-girlfriends roommate (Jamie Chung) hands him a mysterious ticket sealed inside a small white envelope. He has to deliver it to an address all the way down in Chinatown. Before he can begin his ride though hes accosted by Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon) a thuggish plain-clothes NYPD officer who demands that Wilee hand the ticket over. Wilee isnt about to do that (it would be a violation of policy) but Bobby its clear will stop at nothing to get the ticket. Wilee manages to shake him and leap onto his bike zipping over to Broadway for the long ride downtown while Bobby jumps into his car and is soon in hot pursuit. He will spend the entire movie trying to get that ticket but Premium Rush (the title is bike-messenger code for a high-priority assignment) is cleverly structured so that the plot feels more complicated than it is. The movie weaves together chase scenes flashbacks (Bobby is a degenerate gambler) and little excursions into the exotic back-room world of Hawala an underground system of Chinese money transfer that accounts for why that ticket is such a hot property. Gordon-Levitt his dark hair shaved short his eyes narrowed as he peers 10 blocks ahead while churning those bike pedals up and down plays Wilee with a convincingly eager and jockish nonchalance. When he rides head-on into a clogged intersection he rapidly runs through every possible scenario each of which hinge on the direction he might turn his bike and Koepp slows the action way way down (sort of like the fight scenes in the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes films) so that we can see each one. Gordon-Levitt did a lot of his own racing (the closing credits feature an outtake of the actor bloodied after slamming into a cars windshield) but the stunt double work has been seamlessly blended in creating an illusion of endless mastery and quickness. The other spark plug in Premium Rush is Michael Shannons performance He makes Bobby a hilariously angry and over-the-top sociopath but with an animal intelligence that you cant totally laugh off. Hes like a dysfunctional human Terminator; even when hes stymied he wont stop frothing and raging. Premium Rush earns its place as end-of-the-summer escapism but I cant say that its more than a well-done formula flick. At this point its just one more movie-as-ride. But this one at least lives up to its title.

More surprisingly on the silver screen in Premium Rush here is what the same combination fails to produce a good action movie. Watch Premium Rush the official trailer Thats a shame because the ingredients should add up to some real kinetic fun. Undeniably the word ""action"" does apply but only as it falls between ""class"" and ""suit.""Yep sue these guys for blatantly false advertising This isnt premium and it sure aint a rush.The city in question is Manhattan where our hero may well be your villain. Thats cause Wilee (pronounced as a prefix to Coyote) is a bike courier the daredevil kind devoted to his ""fixie."" Translation a bicycle with a fixed gear a lightweight steel frame and more to the point no brakes.Periodically then he interrupts his forward momentum by skidding to a halt.The film alas does much the same.The early frames spot Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt with his hair like his bike shorn to the bare essentials) pedalling maniacally through the urban maze of killer cabs and oblivious foot traffic and yawning car doors.En route via his cellphone headset he keeps up a running conversation with his colleagues in the courier biz - including his sometimes girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) a sissy who insists on front brakes at the very least and his constant rival Manny whose ride of choice is a handcrafted Parlee complete with carbon frame and electronic shifters.A bike courier on a Parlee is the equivalent of a pizza-delivery guy zipping around in a Lamborghini but in the good name of entertainment lets allow that little anomaly to slide. In which case we wait for entertainment to announce itself. And wait.In the interim a wavering storyline starts to appear something about mobsters in Chinatown a couriered envelope suspicious in its contents a young Asian mother desperate to reunite with her little boy and a corrupt cop with ""impulse-control issues"" (Michael Shannons overwrought performance is similarly afflicted). None of this matters of course. The plot is just the paint job on the vehicle This is a chase flick pure and simple where the thrill is in the sheer raw speed. Or should be.Certainly there are chases aplenty - cars chasing bikes bikes chasing each other through red lights up onto sidewalks heading the wrong way on a one-way street. But how you might well ask does this mayhem differ from any normal day on the mean streets of Manhattan? Well therein lies the problem It doesnt at least not enough to put the thrill in the ride.Director David Koepp possesses the standard modern arsenal of bike-cams and trick riders and orchestrated stunts and CGI enhancements. However like too many of his Hollywood peers Koepp is a professional technician brimming with competence yet bereft of unique talent. So the chase scenes have no visual flair and consequently we have no visceral reaction - hearts that should be in mouths are still at home comfortably at rest and skipping nary a beat. As for our minds they are just put on hold perhaps occasionally wandering back to remembrances of kinetic things past - to the classic chases in The General or Bullitt or The French Connection. The history is rich; the present seems stuck in a fixed gear.Maybe that is why Premium Rush feels obliged to provide its own built-in thumbs-up reviewer. Enthuses Vanessa in the throes of the pictures climax ""Thats the most fun Ive had with my clothes on.""Speak for yourself girlfriend or better yet get those clothes off - but that would be a whole other movie.

Special to Newsday + - This film image released by Columbia Pictures shows Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a scene from ""Premium Rush."" Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A New York City bicycle messenger is endangered by a mysterious package. BOTTOM LINE Enjoyable kineticism that bicycles from serious to silly. CAST Joseph Gordon-Levitt Michael Shannon Dania Ramirez LENGTH 131 ""Premium Rush"" is both the title of this movie and its clever if less than subtle promise to summer audiences -- which it mostly delivers with its adrenaline-junkie bicycle messenger chased all over Manhattan by a crooked cop. On the downside the movie has a tone as all-over-the-map as the story suspenseful crime drama popcorn action movie and cartoon slapstick. Law school grad turned king-of-the-messengers Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has 90 minutes to deliver a receipt worth 50000 to a Chinese human transporter -- three years worth of savings by dissident Nima (Jamie Chung) who wants to bring her toddler to the States. However its also worth 50 large ones to gambling-addict NYPD detective Robert Monday (Michael Shannon) the worst cop since ""Bad Lieutenant."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Mondays a bad day for Wilee as the desperate detective chases corners threatens and even tries reasoning with him to hand over the receipt. Complicating matters is Wilees love interest Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) and rival messenger Manny (Wole Parks) whos trying to make time with her and constantly challenging Wilee to macho duels of bikesmanship with such unintentionally homoerotic howlers as ""Have you seen my thighs?"" The most interesting thing? The multiple scenarios Wilee imagines whenever a crash is looming with some alternatives involving gruesome Rube Goldberg cause-and-effect like the ""Final Destination"" movies. Director and co-writer David Koepp credibly justifies the extreme choices the characters make If youve ever wanted to yell at the screen about the baby-sitter entering the spooky room instead of running out the door theres none of that here. Everything makes sense -- at least until the subplot about a Wile E. Coyote bike cop (Christopher Place) who keeps getting hurt and until Shannon goes from feral menace to observational humor. His ambulance scene with Gordon-Levitt is funny and sharp and belongs in another movie. In fact ""Premium Rush"" may be a bargain Its three or four kinds of movies for one ticket.

Photo Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dania Ramirez look appalled -- and they should be with this dumb flick. If youve ever wondered why Manhattan bike messengers hurtle through red lights barrel over sidewalks and fly the wrong way on one-way streets ""Premium Rush"" provides an answer The biker might be going to Chinatown with a movie ticket on which someone has scrawled a happy face. Stakes arent the only problem with this sloppy thriller which combines careening images with turgid storytelling. When an angry cop (Michael Shannon) tells bike messenger Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) ""This whole city hates you"" I was certainly ready to join a standing ovation but alas the cop a degenerate gambler is the bad guy. Were supposed to root for the biker who daily breaks about 50 laws while endangering countless pedestrians. Wilee is a Columbia graduate whod rather make 80 bucks a day risking his life biking through traffic than put on a suit. His bike doesnt even have brakes on it. Todays assignment? Pick up a package at his alma mater and get it miles downtown to Chinatown in an hour and a half. PHOTOS PREMIUM RUSH NY PREMIERE You could do that on the subway but that would be no fun. Wilee instead rockets through the streets pursued by Det. Monday (Shannon) who needs the ticket Wilee is carrying to pay off a debt though Monday should probably be worried about other things given that he has just killed a Chinese gangster with many surly friends. The normally superb Shannon this time goes with nonstop screaming and a witchs cackle which makes his extremely dumb villain hilarious when hes supposed to be scary. Meanwhile another cop this one honest but dorky is speeding around on his bike trying to catch Wilee for traffic violations which yields yet more cool footage of bike chases in traffic. But eventually he seems to realize that cops never do this and he simply stops. And Wilee? Hes literally just an errand boy who is doing a job for someone he barely knows for 30. Why does he bother? At one point he decides he doesnt even want this gig and returns the package so the movie reboots. Sigh. Director and co-writer David Koepp is a master screenwriter whose credits include ""Jurassic Park"" ""Carlitos Way"" and ""Spider-Man"" so its puzzling that what were watching wouldnt even make an acceptable first draft. The ticket in the messengers envelope is worth 50000 but not to Wilee. Its important to someone else but shes a boring passive subsidiary character and anyway the ultimate problem is an immigration issue. Couldnt an immigration problem be as easily solved at 701 p.m. as at 7? If not why would someone wait till 530 to tackle the crisis? Not that its likely that a biker could be knocked unconscious in Midtown at 633 take an ambulance ride get out of the ambulance make his way miles uptown to a police tow yard steal two bikes and pedal back down to Chinatown in 27 minutes. And Im still trying to figure out why a guy picking up a package at 116th and Broadway and headed downtown would instead next be found half a mile north under the elevated train at about 125th Street. The only reason is that Koepp likes the look of that area but if youre going to keep updating the action with graphics telling us exactly which block each one is you can hardly protest that the audience thinks youre paying attention to detail. Koepp throws in a love interest (a fellow courier Vanessa played as a routine sassy chick by Dania Ramirez) and a rival for her affections (Wole Parks). But this isnt much of a love triangle since she obviously prefers Wilee and the plot veers off course yet again when the two guys have a race in Central Park. This is supposed to be a life-and-death chase movie not two friends messing around. Did ""Star Wars"" interrupt the climax to show us Han and Luke racing X-wings?

Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Jamie Chung Michael Shannon Dania Ramirez Aasif Mandvi Aaron Tveit Heather Lindell Lauren Ashley Carter Darlene Violette Wayne Stephens Director David Koepp Release Opened Aug 24 2012  Editorial Review Dont shoot the messengerBy Stephanie MerryFriday August 24 2012Bicycle messengers have to deal with a lot of risks. Car doors suddenly fling open minivans make right turns without signaling potholes can be a one-way ticket for a trip over the handlebars. Or as is the case in ""Premium Rush"" a dirty cop can get in the way of what should be a straightforward courier job shepherding an envelope from Morningside Heights to Chinatown. Thats the premise of the breezy and entertaining if imperfect action flick starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the appropriately named Wilee a Columbia Law School grad who opted for a life of adrenaline over one of suits and torts. He sails across Manhattan on a fixed-gear bike with no brakes. At least he wears a helmet which comes in handy on many occasions including the scene that opens the film Wilee flies through the air amid windshield shards after somersaulting over a cab to the tune of ""Baba ORiley."" Its 633 p.m. From there the film immediately rewinds taking the audience back to how the young man landed in this situation. Its been a tough day already considering Wilee is having a fight with his girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) also a messenger. But its about to get a lot worse after his boss at Security Courier gives him the task of picking up a package at Columbia. Its a rush delivery and he has 90 minutes to fly down Broadway and hand it to a woman named Sister Chen (potentially modeled on the real-life snakehead kingpin Sister Ping) in Chinatown. A few things stand in Wilees way. One is a terrifying hotheaded police officer Bobby Monday (a terrific Michael Shannon) who has his sights set on the envelope in Wilees messenger bag. Another is a bike cop who doesnt appreciate Wilees risky riding methods. Theres also Wilees messenger nemesis Manny a cyclist who wears spandex rides a bike with gears (the horror) and whose muscles are rivaled in size only by his massive pickup truck. Its a fun ride with well-drawn characters and Gordon-Levitt as always is dependable as a watchable lead. Writer-director David Koepp has a way of immersing the audience in the action setting the camera at handlebar height as Wilee weaves in and out of traffic. He also cleverly demonstrates Wilees thought process when it comes to choosing a path of least resistance. A white line shows that if he cuts right he might hit that baby carriage but going left would mean getting hit by a truck; straight ahead it is. In that same vein Koepp gives the film a strong sense of time and place. A clock pops up periodically to remind viewers that the minutes are winding down. The camera also zooms out occasionally to give a satellite view and show where in New York the action is taking place and how far Wilee must travel to reach his destination. Yet as the movie unfolds the story keeps flashing back with expository bits explaining why Detective Monday is so interested in this envelope and what the mysterious little ticket inside actually means. Its important information but intercutting it into the chase significantly stalls the momentum. Meanwhile a late-in-the-game plot point that seems destined to create an epic ending akin to the final heist in the 1999 version of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" unfolds with a fizzle. It might not be a noteworthy film but ""Premium Rush"" delivers what it promises. The summertime diversion will give audiences a little jolt of nervous energy along with a few laughs. A rush is about making the most of the present not creating lasting memories.Contains language and violence.

"Premium Rush review Hell on wheels | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPremium Rush review Hell on wheelsChase thriller Premium Rush will leave many tongues tut-tutting. Better to just back and savor the jolt of pure adrenaline.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dania Ramirez in the ridiculous yet thrilling Premium Rush.  (Sarah Shatz / Columbia Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 23 2012Premium Rush (out of 4)Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Michael Shannon Dania Ramirez Wole Parks and Jamie Chung. Written and directed by David Koepp. 91 minutes. Opens Aug. 24 at major theatres. 14AChase thriller Premium Rush spins on the daredevil wheels of bicycle couriers and it will leave cops frowning drivers fuming and pedestrians cowering.Thats only if they take it too seriously. Better to just sit back and enjoy it as a summer jolt of pure adrenaline.Article Continued BelowIts an unlikely vehicle for a story of intrigue and danger. Writer/director David Koepp knows this and delights in showing us the error of our assumptions.Hes assembled a crackerjack cast led by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon who bring the right blend of drama and levity to a story thats more than a little ridiculous but at the same time well paced and plotted. Leave your judgments about cyclists in the parking lot if youre the type who rages over reckless two-wheelers. This entire movie could be shown in schools as a public-safety message about what not to do on a bike. The kids would be sure to pay attention.Gordon-Levitt plays Wilee ace rider for a Manhattan courier firm that promises deliveries fast enough to make emails and faxes seem slow. He earns peanuts whipping around town defying all laws (including gravity) but it sure beats wearing a suit and riding a desk. ""Runnin reds killin peds"" he jokes. Maybe hes not joking.His bike doesnt have brakes much to the chagrin of his girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez TVs Entourage) a fellow courier who wishes Wilee would just slow down. (Yet another courier jealous rival Manny (Wole Parks) wishes Wilee would slow down with Vanessa.)""I cant stop"" Wilee says. ""Dont want to either.""He isnt entirely lacking in common sense or scruples. Sent across town on a rush delivery for an anxious woman named Nima (Jamie Chung The Hangover Part II) he turns old-school postman when a burly fellow named Monday (Michael Shannon) demands he hand over the envelope. Nothing will stop Wilee from completing his appointed rounds. He takes flight with Monday in hot pursuit by car. Theres much more at stake here than a money-back guarantee as we learn on the gallop.Koepp parcels out information following an on-screen timeline that frequently backs up to fill in a plot gap. At times the movie resembles a commercial for a GPS device as Wilee plots the fastest line from A to B and how best to dodge threatening taxis and looming baby strollers.Its a tougher movie than you might expect -- some bad things happen -- but also a goofier one than the circumstances would suggest. The object being energetically delivered and hotly sought is a genuine MacGuffin. It makes no real sense to the story but it is nevertheless of utmost importance to the people in it.Shannons bug-eyed Monday makes the obligatory Wile E. Coyote joke about Wilee but it is actually Monday who is more like a cartoon character. He wants that MacGuffin really really badly and hes prepared to go to absurd lengths to get it.Its a clever story as propulsive as some of Koepps best-known work -- he wrote the screenplays for Jurassic Park and Sam Raimis Spider-Man -- but without the arcane intricacies that sometimes mar his more serious films. He also wrote the first Mission Impossible movie and people are still wondering what that was about.Premium Rush is a pure rush like lightning on wheels and if people get a bicycle safety message out of it consider it a bonus.Gordon-Levitt found out for himself two summers ago when Premium Rush was filming in the streets of Manhattan. He had an accident that required 31 stitches to his arm. The bandage he wore is in the film as is a closing-credits video clip that recalls the spill.

Photo Sarah Shatz Associated Press Premium Rush review bike messenger vs. cop 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Like the lithe and maligned carriers weaving their way through Big Apple traffic ""Premium Rush"" is a thin brash sinewy thing built entirely for speed. Its plot is basic Bike messenger Wilee as in Wile E. Coyote (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) picks up an envelope at Columbia University and gets chased around Manhattan by a bonkers cop named Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon). The envelope contains a slip of paper worth 50000. The cop has a gambling problem an impulse-control problem and a problem with bike-riding punks who call him the d-word. Directed by ""Ghost Towns"" David Koepp the film boasts some throwback touches It was shot on good old celluloid and an early chase scene under an elevated train evokes ""The French Connection."" But its not oldfangled. Check out the maps arrows and other buzzy graphics which point out Wilees course as he bombs from one end of the island to another. Check out the whiplash hypothetical scenarios that unfold at various intersections as Wilee his eyes quirked in close-up decides in a split second whether to peel to the right (nope hed hit a baby) peel to the left (nope a dude would get squished by a UPS truck) or find some alternate crazy route kinked with turns (yep he squeaks through with his life intact). And check out this new New York - still a knotty urban madhouse but cleaner shinier sunnier more eco-hip complete with a bike-patrol police officer who tears after Wilee in mounting frustration. And Monday himself isnt corrupt in the usual sense; for once there isnt some dirtbag conspiracy plaguing New Yorks finest. The guy is acting alone. What makes this whole thing work is first of all Wilees ride an elegant machine that lacks any gears or brakes. So the pedals never stop and neither does the movie The screenplay (by Koepp and John Kamp) is as brakeless as the bicycle. Whole swaths of dialogue occur mid-route as Wilee yaks it up via headset with his girlfriend (Dania Ramirez) and rival (Wole Parks) both of them messengers too. Gordon-Levitt and Shannon are perfectly cast. Who better to play a smart wiry hero and the nutcase in hot pursuit? Shannons delectable weirdness so often exploited for its creep factor or more rarely its fragile pathos (""Take Shelter"") here assumes a breezy comic zip that lightens the proceedings. Despite his unhinged behavior he isnt the films primary menace. More danger lurks in yellow cabs and car doors. Premium Rush Action thriller. Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon. Directed by David Koepp. (PG-13. 91 minutes.) Amy Biancolli is a Hearst movie writer.

Director David Koepp deftly directs the harrowing sequences in which Wilee and his colleagues dodge cars taxis school buses pedestrians baby carriages and other looming obstacles. Wilees ""Coyote"" nickname is not just a cartoon reference. He travels the city below the radar evading human interaction. He so loves courting danger that he rides a ""fixie"" a single-gear bike with no brakes. Careening his bicycle across car hoods swerving down flights of stairs and propelling it over walls Wilees like Evel Knievel-- without the preening spectacle.About the moviePremium Rush   out of fourStars Joseph Gordon-Levitt Michael Shannon Dania Ramirez Wol? Parks Jamie Chung Director David KoeppDistributor Columbia Pictures Rating PG-13 for some violence intense action sequences and language Running time 1 hour 30 minutes Opens Friday nationwideKoepps stylistic flourishes work such as Wilees multiple split-second visions of the outcome of any given maneuver. These energetic ""what-if"" scenarios recall the rapid-fire editing of the seminal 1998 German thriller Run Lola Run.Wilees last assignment of the day is to get an envelope from Nima (Jamie Chung) who works at Columbia Law School where Wilee used to be a student. (He explains to a co-worker that he couldnt stomach spending his days sitting in a drab office so he dropped out and took to his bike.)Within minutes of securing the envelope Wilee is approached by a stranger who identifies himself as a school official and attempts to take back the package. The stranger is actually corrupt NYPD detective Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon). Always an intense actor Shannon chews the scenery in a way that is at once comical and commanding.Monday sets out to thwart Wilee at every turn. Literally. Driving a nondescript sedan he chases the bicyclist all over town leaving traffic jams and outraged motorists in his wake.In a less thrilling subplot lithe Wilee has a rivalry going with brawny fellow bike messenger Manny (Wole Parks). Each considers himself the hottest biker around and both are attracted to co-worker Vanessa (Dania Ramirez).Gordon-Levitt spends nearly the entire movie on his bike which makes for dynamic sequences through the compressed landscape of traffic-choked streets. Despite far-fetched plot points -- such as a flash mob of bike messengers ready to rumble and thwart evil -- its easy to get caught up in this life-or-death two-wheeled slalom.

Sarah Shatz/Sony Pictures Premium Rush Director David Koepp Genre Action Running Time 91 minutes Rated PG-13 for some violence intense action sequences and language With Joseph Gordon-Levitt Michael Shannon Dania Ramirez Jamie Chung Lauren Ashley Carter A character weve yet to meet flies through the air in slow motion above a busy New York street arms and legs splayed. Hes wearing a bike helmet which is a good thing -- because as The Whos ""Baba ORiley"" pulses in the background and numbers come up on the screen telling us its 633 p.m. he lands with a thud on the pavement. For a second or two he lies there staring -- at a car careering toward him a woman mouthing his name a bike that lies crumpled at his side. You might want to take those moments to catch your breath. You wont be offered many other chances. Because a few seconds later the film rewinds leaping back in time to tell you how he got here An envelope at Columbia University needed delivering to Chinatown and as played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt this guys a pedal-pumping courier. His name is Wilee (his nickname is Coyote though hes more the Roadrunner in this story) and almost from the moment he picks up the envelope hes scooting up alleys and darting against traffic to get away from a corrupt cop who covets whats in it. Officer Monday both menacing and hapless as played by Michael Shannon is at a real disadvantage driving a car. On Manhattans jammed avenues he cant begin to keep up with Wiley who has evidently given up a legal career for what qualifies as something of a contact sport -- zipping through Manhattan on a stripped-down ""fixie"" a bike with no gearshift and no brakes. In a flashback Wilees girlfriend who is also a messenger wonders if he has a death wish; its a question that might reasonably be asked of the films actors as well. i Officer Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon) is interested in what Wilee is carrying. Sarah Shatz/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sarah Shatz/Sony Pictures Officer Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon) is interested in what Wilee is carrying. Sarah Shatz/Sony Pictures Writer-director David Koepp who has penned dozens of action scripts from Spider-Man all the way back to Jurassic Park doesnt seem terribly anxious to freight any of this with meaning; Premium Rush is just a fun ride. But the director does do a few things in it that are unusual for Tinseltown His New York actually looks like New York with a largely Asian- Hispanic- and African-American cast. And thats really New York theyre all careering through at breakneck speed not some studio back lot. Gordon-Levitt even did a lot of his own stunts -- and took his own falls as an end-credits outtake makes clear. All of which means this young actors star already bright -- hes currently the most humanizing aspect of The Dark Knight Rises and has the much-anticipated Looper opening next month -- will only burn brighter in the Hollywood firmament. It also means Premium Rush offers a pretty decent end-of-summer adrenaline rush.

"Premium Rush is like Speed on a brakeless bicycle Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Premium Rush a thrilling bike rideBad New York cop plus a guy on a bicycle make for a tightly wound radically fresh slice of street action in the film starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon.August 23 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dania Ramirez in ""Premium Rush."" (Sarah Shatz Columbia TriStar )""Premium Rush"" starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon is a lot like the ticking-clock thriller of ""Speed"" except instead of a big bus and a bigger bomb theres a brakeless bike and a small envelope. Which actually doesnt sound like it would work at all as a tightly wound slice of street action but it does and in radically fresh ways.In a sense the movie has its bomb in Shannons dirty NYPD Det. Bobby Monday. Hes a wired whack job with a gambling habit and rage issues. The envelope hes after has a ticket that promises to pay off his debt with some brutal Chinatown backroom money lenders. The guy who is holding the bag in every sense of the word is Wilee (Gordon-Levitt) one of New York Citys cocky bike messengers. And like his namesake a Wile E. Coyote a when hes riding full tilt its not unlike watching that infamous cartoon blur.Basically a story like this boils down to getting from Point A to Point B without getting killed. The challenge is how to make the obstacle course interesting. In this writer-director David Koepp and his frequent writing partner John Kamps have as the saying goes put it all on the screen. In fact the screen becomes a scene-stealing player.PHOTOS 101 films to see in 2012It all begins at the end. In an almost balletic deceleration of motion the film opens with a slow pan of a bit of blue sky then skyscrapers and finally limbs Wilees float through the frame. When body meets concrete the time appears on-screen and soon everything is spinning backward to a point just before this race-for-his-life officially began. Watching the seconds click off or spin back creates something akin to a lethal stopwatch effect so that you cringe any time it appears. Its just one of the nifty elements that keep the tension high.The story picks up on Wilees last run of the day. Its a premium rush job but otherwise ordinary enough a pick up a package race through crosstown congestion and deliver it on time. Not surprisingly its whats inside the package that matters and whats interesting is the way in which the film keeps you guessing about what will happen next.Besides the cop called Monday who keeps turning up like a bad penny other players who become mitigating factors include Wilees on-and-off-again girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez); his main competition a macho messenger named Manny (Wole Park); and Nima (Jamie Chung) the girl who gives Wilee the ticket to ride. There are reasons why Nima is so desperate why Wilee and Vanessas relationship is rocky and why Manny is obsessed with racing him through Central Park. But rather than fully developed plot twists they function more like shots of Red Bull something to give the movie a jolt when watching a guy ride a bike for 90 minutes straight threatens to get boring.What the filmmakers have done with such pizazz is exploit all the latest cultural touchstones. The bike messenger scene has its own ethos of rebellious outsiders who thrive on extreme athleticism.The action is inventive extensive and exciting a bang-up job by cinematographer Mitchell Amundsen one of the towns hot new shooters. But it is the way in which the big screen is turned into a kind of giant cellphone map app that is the real kick. Every time Wilee has to make a decision on which route to take it comes to connect-the-dots life in a way that anyone whos ever used MapQuest will immediately recognize. (For those who know New York City well it is even more fun.)Wilee is a nice stretch for Gordon-Levitt who more typically plays a hipster charmer as he did so well in ""(500) Days of Summer."" There was the suggestion he could go rogue in 2010s ""Hesher"" but almost no one saw that little indie. As Wilee hes toughened his inner core a both literally and figuratively a in a way that makes him a more formidable presence on-screen. That was critical considering the actor had to go up against the towering force-field created by Shannon who seems to be working his way through 50 shades of crazy. The actor has the ability to emotionally unhinge himself right in front of you and he makes Monday fearsome even at a distance.The guy on the bike and the bad cop prove to be a combustible combo. Who knew a bike ride could be so thrilling?betsy.sharkeylatimes.com---------------------------------Premium RushMPAA rating PG-13 for some violence intense action sequences and languageRunning time 1 hour 31 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCritics Pick Action Guy Joseph Gordon-Levitt in LooperOctober 17 2012Critics Pick Premium Rush not just another action flickSeptember 5 2012Premium Rush is a fun adrenaline-fueled ride critics sayAugust 24 2012Premium Rush and a vicious cycleAugust 23 2012Dania Ramirezs career gets a Premium RushApril 29 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentJoseph Gordon LevittCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-premium-rush-20120824,0,96610.story",200,premiumrush20,premiumrush,latimes

In this silly serpentine Manhattan chase pic Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the intrepid bike messenger Wilee - as in Wile E. Coyote - and Michael Shannon is his nemesis Detective Monday although he keeps telling everybody hes Forrest J. Ackerman (an off-point reference to the late movie-memorabilia collector and sci-fi maven). Video Trailer Premium Rush More about Premium Rush >> But its really Shannons character a crooked cop with a gambling debt who should take the name of the relentless Looney Tunes stalker and Gordon-Levitt should change his to Road Runner. He doesnt announce himself with a beepbeep but in every other way Wilee outsmarts and outmaneuvers his pursuer. If Shannon dropped an anvil on Gordon-Levitts head hed dodge the plummeting object and somehow make sure Shannon got his noggin flattened instead. Unfortunately David Koepp - the A-list Hollywood screenwriter (Jurassic Park War of the Worlds) and decidedly less-successful director (Ghost Town Secret Window) - cant find the right Looney Tunes-ish tone for his immersion into bike-messenger culture. Like Quicksilver that 80s Kevin Bacon classic Premium Rush dives headlong into the glamorous world of two-wheeled couriers the torn T-shirts and grease-smeared shorts the gruff but lovable dispatcher (Aasif Mandvi) the foxy female cyclist (Dania Ramirez) the tony boites where the tattooed pedal-pushers congregate and hey just the whole bike messenger esprit de corps. ""We get paid to ride"" enthuses Wilee. ""What could be better than that?"" But as Gordon-Levitt goes hurtling down Broadway to deliver an envelope in Chinatown before the 7 p.m. deadline Premium Rush cant decide if its a serious ticking-clock thriller or an antic stunt-driven cartoon. Shannon Oscar-nominated for Revolutionary Road and responsible for a beautifully calibrated performance as the Midwestern family man haunted by apocalyptic dreams in Take Shelter has clearly decided hes in an animated romp. The actor huffs and puffs cracks his knuckles and pops his eyes wide cursing every time Wilee gets away. Which is every time they hit an intersection. Wilee shimmies and weaves through the waves of pedestrians and cross traffic while Monday is left honking his horn stuck behind a bus. Stealing a gimmick from Limitless (it worked more efficaciously with Bradley Cooper) Wilee - riding his brakeless fixed-gear bike - pre-visualizes the options when he pulls up to a light Go to the left and get doored? Cut to the right and get run over by a van? Snake up the middle and hell hit a baby in a stroller. But look If he jags just this way and then zigs that way and jumps the curb onto the sidewalk hes good to go. Theres a high-speed sequence under the trestles of an elevated subway line that evokes - pathetically - The French Connection and theres some borderline ethnic caricaturing as Koepp ventures into black-market financing and Pai Gow betting parlors in Chinatown. Gordon-Levitt messenger bag strapped to his torso and a helmet to his head does a lot of his own riding (a closing credit outtake shows the aftermath of a collision with a cab) although the trickier stunt work is left in the hands and wheels of professionals. Wilee who makes his fateful pickup at the Columbia campus knows the university because he was in law school there. Maybe one day hell take the bar put on a suit and settle down with a nice six-figure income. But right now ""the bike wants to go fast"" he says to his girlfriend. And he wants to be on it.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday August 23 2012 258 PM Title Premium Rush Film Info PG-13 Language. Area theaters. Feeling burned out from the summers over-the-top action spectacles? Take ""Premium Rush"" for a spin. Cruising the streets of Manhattan clocking in at a tight 90 minutes and set on a bike without brakes this loose-limbed action-drama is a swift sweaty ode to the citys subcultures and a punky descendant of 70s B-movies. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Wilee a bike messenger who rides a ""fixie"" -- a lightweight cycle with no stopping power good for tricky maneuvers and fast speeds. Wilee is first glimpsed flying not on the pavement but in midair landing in the middle of Broadway. Then we see how he got there On a hot summers day Wilee is sent to the upper West Side to pick up an envelope at Columbia University. Riding across campus he zips past a guy who is about to seriously mess up Wilees day. That guy is Det. Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon) an on-the-edge cop with a gambling addiction. Hes in dutch with Chinatown tough guys and the package Wilees picked up could be Mondays ticket out. He just has to catch him first. So off they go gliding through traffic (in mostly non-CGI chase scenes). Wilee and his fellow messengers go over and under cars the sun beating down on them and the wired detective sometimes beating on them too. Because while Wilees commitment to his delivery bugs the cop the kids smartass manner bugs him too. Whats in the bag is just ""the MacGuffin"" as gimmicks that drive movie plots are called. The kick comes from the snappy attitude and the wild metropolitan tour. This is miles from the 1986 bike melodrama ""Quicksilver."" Director David Koepp who co-wrote the script with John Kamps even provides a cool way to see Wilees split-second pursuit assessments. We see each possibility as he decides which turn will result in a smashup a stroller being hit or a quick getaway. Koepps light touch with actors -- evident in his last film the criminally underrated ""Ghost Town"" -- here gives his stars room to roll. Like Wilees bike the great Gordon-Levitts career has no brakes. ""50/50"" was last years example but he also was the most human face in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" And Shannon is terrific grimacing and sneering in his own charming way. He makes the hot-tempered cop a funny scary recognizable urban animal. Theres a moment early on that marks the film. Shannon in a car is flooring it next to Gordon-Levitt on his bike. They bait each other shout like the devil and set the stage for their own dog day afternoon. The scene moves  the actors click into high gear and ""Premium Rush"" delivers.

"Premium Rush Getting in gear with Joseph Gordon-Levitt - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Premium Rush Getting in gear with Joseph Gordon-Levitt Share Tweet Share Tweet By Mark Feeney Globe Staff | 08.23.12 | 242 PM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Premium Rush"" sounds like the name of an energy drink. Commercial tie-in possibilities anyone? What the title of this movie about bicycle messengers in Manhattan actually refers to is the highest-priced category of delivery service like express mail only with handlebars. And if youre buying premium rush service the messenger you want is Wilee. For several years running he has been crowned champion messenger of Manhattan. Hes fast hes reliable hes crazy. How crazy? ""Brakes are death"" he likes to say. If you have ever been doored -- or for that matter hit by a speeding cyclist -- this is not the movie for you. As Wilee Joseph Gordon-Levitt zips through the city over the course of a late afternoon and early evening. ""Premium Rush"" opens with him flying through the air (as if his character in ""Inception"" has donned a bicycle helmet) and it ends with . . . well lets just say a lot happens. Some of it includes a romantic triangle gambling debts Chinatown gangsters a really unlucky NYPD bicycle patrolman and inevitably a race against time. ""Premium Rush"" has a lot of energy -- too much its kind of exhausting. It also has a lot of trickiness. David Koepp who directed and co-wrote the script with John Kamps piles up plot twists and flashbacks. To try to limit confusion (good luck with that) he frequently superimposes on the screen a digital readout of what time it is and has a CGI-projection of Manhattan pop up to show the route Wilee is about to take. Dont look too closely at the street signs though otherwise you might start laughing. To get from Morningside Heights to Chelsea you go through Central Park? Only if youre taking the scenic route. The pop-ups must have sounded pretty sexy at the pitch meeting but on the screen they look lame as well as slick -- not a good combination. Less slick but considerably lamer is a gimmick whereby whenever Wilee comes to a particularly challenging intersection we see him anticipate various routes in slow motion. If he goes that way he hits a pedestrian. If he goes another way he ends up under a bus. But if he goes this way then yes he crosses safely -- and the film speeds up again. Its like a cycling form of spider-sense only were the ones who are supposed to feel the tingling. Koepp is no stranger to spider-sense. He provided the script for the first ""Spider-Man"" movie as he has for a pretty amazing number of other blockbusters ""Jurassic Park"" ""Mission Impossible"" ""War of the Worlds"" ""Panic Room"" ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" ""Angels amp; Demons."" What all of those very different movies have in common (other than big budgets and big box office) is length. ""Premium Rush"" lasts 85 minutes -- and by the 40-minute mark you may be sucking wind harder than Wilee ever does. The story needs room to breathe. For whatever reasons Koepp doesnt give it any. Gordon-Levitt is easily the best thing in the movie. He has the wiry build and kamikaze stare of someone who rides a bike for a living amid urban congestion. Michael Shannon as the villain looks like David Letterman doing a Frankenstein imitation. Someone stop this man before he grimaces again Dania Ramirez looks extremely fetching as Gordon-Levitts fellow messenger and love interest (expect New York cabs to start sporting ""I Brake for Dania Ramirez"" bumper stickers) but much of an actress shes not. ""Premium Rush"" opens the same day as ""Cosmopolis"" whose hero spends much of the movie caught in Manhattan traffic. What a double bill theyd make. Add ""Traffic"" and it could be a triple bill (oh wait that movies about something else). Dont expect either to cause gridlock at the box office though.

Premium Rush (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Premium Rush (PG-13) Bicycle chases just arent that much fun to watch. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com8/23/2012 Editor rating 1 The streets of New York City have rarely seemed as dangerous as they do in Premium Rush. A distracted jaywalker an opening cab door a gawking tourist -- all are potentials for calamity when youre a bicycle messenger pedaling through Manhattan in order to deliver a crucial letter or document on time. The best moments in director David Koepps slight dull movie are the scenes in which bike messenger Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) pauses at busy intersections to figure out the path of least obstruction. The film cleverly uses animation to show you the alternate possibilities Wilee considers If he goes left hes going to plow into that baby carriage. If he goes right he will plow right into that slow-moving bus. Best to go straight and beat that speeding town car to the light. Still risky but doable. The bicycling scenes in Premium Rush most of which are done by actual stuntmen with a minimum of computer-generated trickery are fun and cool to watch for a while. But thats all there is to the movie. The plot -- a crooked cop played with a surprising streak of humor by Michael Shannon is trying to keep Wilee from delivering his latest package -- is as layered and complex as a TV ad for detergent. Koepp who also wrote the script with John Kamps tries to disguise the slightness of this material by playing with the films chronology and stamping the ticking minutes on the screen. Wilees name is a clever derivation of Wile E. Coyote from the Road Runner cartoons. There is also a female bike messenger (Dania Ramirez) but her name is plain old Vanessa. If the filmmakers had been brazen they would have named her Hot Chick which neatly sums up the reason for her presence in the movie. Gordon-Levitt spends almost the entirety of Premium Rush running or bicycling or scrambling Hes a constant blur of motion which proves hes an athletic actor in terrific shape. But if I want to watch extreme bike stunts I turn on ESPN. If you grew up in the 1980s you may vaguely remember a movie called Quicksilver in which Kevin Bacon played a bicycle messenger in San Francisco. Youve probably forgotten it though. A similar fate awaits Premium Rush. Cast Joseph Gordon-Levitt Michael Shannon Dania Ramirez Wole Parks. Director David Koepp. Screenwriters David Koepp John Kamps. Producer Gavin Polone. A Columbia Pictures release. Running time 91 minutes. Vulgar language brief violence. Playing at area theaters.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The skeleton of ""Premium Rush"" is as old as the movies a chase. Its how the skeleton is fleshed out that makes the movie such loopy crazed dangerous fun. Writer/director David Koepp mixes sharp dialogue a hip tone and top-flight actors to create a nail-biting seat-squirming thriller about a bike messenger. Its an escapist blast. The film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt whose presence these days is almost a guarantee of a great movie. He plays Wilee nicknamed after the tenacious coyote in the ""Road Runner"" cartoons. Hes plenty smart a Columbia Law School grad but hes addicted to the parkour-on-wheels adrenaline surge of dodging death on Manhattans chaotic streets. In a voiceover of telegraphic brevity he introduces himself ""I like to ride. Fixed gear. No brakes. Cant stop. Dont want to either."" The exhilaration on Gordon-Levitts mug as he negotiates serpentine lane shifts is joyous to behold. He takes in every option in an instant visualizes potential hazards and collisions then fearlessly weaves and bobs through the least-lethal alternative. The chorus of screeching brakes blaring horns and profane suggestions he inspires is music to his ears. Hes part of a bustling multicultural competitive bike-delivery service where every supporting role is cast to wicked perfection. Spandex-clad hot dog Manny (Wole Parks) is Wilees rival for deliveries and for the affections of alluring Vanessa (Dania Ramirez). Wilee aims to wheedle his way back into her good graces by handling a high-priority drop for her roommate. But volatile Bobby Monday (seasoned sad-eyed Michael Shannon) wants that thin envelope too. And he has a car. And a gun. And an NYPD detectives badge. Once the no-flab story is set in motion it rockets along at breakneck velocity with Vanessa Manny and a hard-charging bike cop (Christopher Place) joining the dash. Koepp executes the hide-and-seek cat-and-mouse crosstown chases in visually striking style and vividly evokes the textures of diverse neighborhoods. He divides the story into nonchronological chapters handling the time shifts adroitly staying on track and keeping us guessing. He goes easy on the violence and when he does unleash it its fast impressive and terrible. Everyone has an urgent stake in the proceedings but nobodys going to nuke Times Square if the package doesnt arrive on time. Rather than force-feeding us the usual action-thriller gimmicks -- sneering drug lords secret microchips government coverups -- Koepp gives the plot a pleasing plausibility and rich dashes of New York City local color. Sarah Shatz Star Tribune Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in Columbia Pictures ""Premium Rush."" The same goes for Wilees nemesis Bobby. Hes a multifaceted character not a stock villain. With his dry wisecracks brawling masculinity and colorful shortcomings (hes hooked on Chinese dominoes) he could be the hero of another movie. Here he hits a patch of tough luck that gets worse at every turn as do his judgment and impulse control. Hes got a good sense of proportion. He knows when to cajole when to show some smiling-cobra menace and when to bust heads. Shannon makes such a feast of Bobbys jovial duplicity that you may find yourself rooting for both Wilee and his adversary. Which was the pleasing confusion that made those ""Road Runner"" cartoons such jaunty delights. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Set in the thrills-filled world of New York City bicycle couriers the film is a live-action cartoon down to its main characters name -- Wilee ""like the coyote."" Its just a few sticks of dynamite and a 10-ton anvil short of going full Looney Tunes and is all the worse for that restraint. Premium Rush Bad to fair Director David Koepp. Cast Joseph Gordon-Levitt Michael Shannon Dania Ramirez. Rating Rated PG-13 for some violence intense action sequences and language. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as Wilee and his instrument of choice is a ""fixie"" -- a primitive fixed-gear brakeless bike that serves as a heavy-handed metaphor for its carefree rider who is inclined to make such grand pronouncements as ""The pedals never stop turning"" and ""Brakes are death."" Thats about the extent of his character development by the way -- pedals fast doesnt like suits wants his courier girlfriend back. Wilees having an average day of casual death defiance zipping through New Yorks gridlocked traffic when he is given a ""premium rush"" delivery of unspecified importance. He has to deliver a small nondescript envelope across the city from an elite college to Chinatown post-haste. No big deal for the fixie-riding maverick courier except NYPD detective Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon) is desperate to get his hands on the envelope setting off a chain of increasingly unlikely chase sequences through the city. Whatever pulse this movie has is owed not to spinning pedals or stunt work but to Shannon the only person in the film who seems to get how ridiculous this whole endeavor is. There is some prime-grade scene-chewing on display as Shannon slips into full villain mode. His corrupt cop is a smorgasbord of indulgent villainous tics the best of which is his crazed manic giggle. Mondays desire for the envelope is explained in a long flashback exploring his illegal Chinatown shenanigans and for the brief stretch that the film turns into the Shannon show its wholly unreservedly awesome. But then the couriers ride back into the story and the films momentum skids to a halt. The dearth of character development means theres a lot of room for special effects and this indulgence gives the film a video-game vibe The city constructs itself into a 3-D grid to better illustrate Wilees progress. In a slow-motion split-second couriers plot out their potential paths and pitfalls. But for all that visual whiz-bang the film is still the most fun when it puts down the gadgets and lets its only developed character do the heavy lifting. And when it lets those other less-developed characters take center stage? Well you get huffed breathless conversations played out by sweaty cycling actors via their smartphones headsets. ""Premium Rush"" is silly right down to its tire tread; if it could have only brought itself to admit that it could have been a lot more fun.

Columbia Pictures-Sony Sarah Shatz Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dania Ramirez in ""Premium Rush."" Columbia Pictures-Sony The delivery pouch for ""Premium Rush"" promises a white-hot thriller from the bike-messenger subculture. But whats inside the package seems like a lukewarm action-comedy from the pile of scripts that Matthew Broderick rejected after ""Ferris Buellers Day Off."" In Brodericks 1980s heyday bike messengers may have been cool but this contemporary story makes little effort to explain their role in the millennial business-place. Worse its paced like an 80s movie with inexcusable pauses and detours during a supposed death race. Wiley (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is the reigning daredevil of Manhattans messengers. A Columbia University law-school dropout he doesnt have brakes on his bike or a ring on the finger of his co-worker girlfriend (Dania Ramirez). Hes a glorified skateboarder who lives for the rush. So when his boss gets an emergency order to deliver an envelope from the uptown university to Chinatown Wileys the man for the job. Yet as soon as he receives the envelope a mysterious thug wants to snatch it from him. The man identifies himself as a university employee; but through a series of iffy coincidences Wiley learns that he is a crooked cop named Monday (Michael Shannon) who is in debt to Chinese gangsters. Someone must have told Shannon that he was acting in a comedy because as hes chasing after the envelope hes enacting a loopy less-than-scary variation of Harvey Keitel in ""Bad Lieutenant."" Likewise the script by successful screenwriter and sometime-director David Koepp is confused with cutesy subplots about Wileys romantic rival and a belligerent bike cop that slow down the story. Although the movie has some good scenes of Wiley riding through New York traffic and calculating his angles of escape it continually spins its wheels or even goes in reverse backtracking to previous points to load new information. By the end ""Premium Rush"" has pedaled so far backward that its on the highway to the danger zone the place where a talented actor such as Gordon-Levitt would rather be the top gun in a training-wheel whimsy than one of the top actors of his generation.

But even if you dont know a fixie (a bike gruelingly stuck with only one gear) from a fixer-upper youre in for a killer ride.Directed with innovative spunkiness by David Koepp who co-wrote the tidy screenplay with John Kamps ""Rush"" takes a Thumbelina-sized premise -- a gambling-addicted NYPD detectives (Michael Shannon) relentless pursuit of a Road Runner-like messenger named Wilee (Gordon-Levitt) -- and packages it into a zippy 89 minutes thats as snug as a pair of undersized spandex cycling shorts. I have to be upfront about all this. Im an obsessed cyclist and pretty much the target audience for ""Rush."" While Im hardly a daredevil like the bike messenger Gordon-Levitt so sportingly portrays the overstuffed drawer in my bedroom bureau attests to my addiction I have a bike-themed T-shirt for every occasion.That said Im also well-acquainted with the rules of the road for good filmmaking. And ""Rush"" cycles through all the B-movie essentials expertly sprinting ahead late in the summer movie race to deliver one of the seasons best surprises.Yes the motivations behind why everyones hot after the envelope given to Wilee by an anxious young woman (Jamie Chung) might not be as interesting as the energetic ""French Connection-like"" daring chase scenes but they do fit in with ""Rushs"" anti-authority theme. Cops China and 9-to-5ers in suits really take it on the chin here.Advertisement But what makes this thriller click are the well-acted characters the action sequences and the keen point of view. All come together in a storyline that unfolds in a single day.Gordon-Levitt who had to get stitched up while filming after slamming into a taxi cab (stay for the end credits to see a flash of the carnage) taps into the mindset of a hard-core street rider. He makes the renegade nonconformist Wilee intriguing appealing and reckless. He certainly looks the part with his well-defined calves pedaling manically on his fixie. Shannon so marvelously paranoid in the underseen ""Take Shelter"" goes full-throttle as the bad cop making him creepy and pathetic. Dania Ramirez (""American Reunion"") gives all the boys a run for their money as Wilees co-worker and on-again/off-again love interest Vanessa -- even if that romance is a footnote. And relative newcomer Wole Parks makes for a very charismatic Manny Wilees rival messenger who has a pricey bike and all the top-notch gear -- the very antithesis of Wilees scrappy style.Koepp puts the cast through the physical wringer setting much of the action and dialogue while actors are in the bike saddle. His best visual trick shows three options from Wilees point of view as he assesses then responds to obstacles in his path. Its an inspired and stylized stroke even if much of the cycling doesnt represent safe riding.So dont take what you see out on the streets simply take ""Premium"" for what it is a snappy fast-paced thriller that provides a genuine rush to close out the summer. Even if you prefer four wheels over two youre in for a pulse-pounding time.Premium Rush    Rating PG-13 (for some violence intense action sequences and language)Cast Joseph Gordon-Levitt Michael Shannon Dania Ramirez Wole Parks Jamie ChungDirector David KoeppRunning time 1 hour 29 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES A Game of Thrones spin-off?

This thriller by David Koepp functions as one long chase scene halting occasionally for flashbacks that explain why the cop wants the package. (Hey didnt we just decide it doesnt matter?) The cycling action is fun and theres a lot of pop mythology about the tao of bike messengers though the latter sounds as if it were written by someone who pays for rush service not someone who provides it.

TWITTER Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as a bike messenger targeted by a crooked cop in director David Koepps asphalt-action tale. An asphalt-action tale as unadorned as the fixed-gear cycle its hero rides David Koepps Premium Rush supplies just enough dramatic rationale to set a series of Manhattan bike chases in motion and then follows without pretending it cares much about anything beyond the adrenaline. A quick pace and always-enjoyable lead Joseph Gordon-Levitt will please moviegoers even if the pics ticking-clock approach isnt as invigoratingly pulpy here as in the Koepp-penned Snake Eyes and Panic Room. Qamp;A Premium Rushs Joseph Gordon-Levitt Dania Ramirez on Stunts Stitches and Shooting in New York Gordon-Levitt plays Wilee a law student-turned-bike messenger who blew off the bar in favor of battling traffic for peanuts. His bike lacking fancy gear-shifts or even a brake is dumb steel compared to the slick cycles his co-workers ride but Wilee and the film embrace its stubborn brand of constantly forward motion as an existential imperative. Sent uptown to his alma mater Columbia University to fetch an envelope destined for Chinatown Wilee becomes the target of a bad cop (Michael Shannon) bent on stealing the package which contains a marker for 50000 intended as payment for smuggling a refugee from China to the U.S. Koepps script co-written by John Kamps zips back in time occasionally to explain itself -- showing for instance how the packages sender a Chinese Columbia student (Jamie Chung) who happens to be the roommate of Wilees girlfriend (Dania Ramirez) wound up fretfully entrusting this valuable slip of paper to a daredevil on two wheels. VIDEO Premium Rush Trailer Joseph Gordon-Levitt Races Through Streets of New York With Mysterious Envelope But the main attraction of these narrative detours is the time they afford us with Shannon who chews scenery while accumulating massive debt in Chinatown gambling dens then desperately setting out to repay it by intercepting Wilees package. Shannon and Aasif Mandvi (as Wilees dispatcher) are high points in a supporting cast that otherwise fails to add much to one-note roles. Gordon-Levitt sets aside much of his boyish charm to play a character who relies less on wit than nerve. As he hurtles down New York streets the actors alert eyes are as vital in conveying the kinetic geography as is Mitchell Amundsens camera and Koepps occasional time-outs -- stopping action to visualize possible routes through vehicle-and-pedestrian chaos before settling on the least hazardous one -- are effective in getting us on Wilees hyper-perceptive wavelength. VIDEO Comic-Con 2012 Looper Star Joseph Gordon-Levitt on Getting Kicked in the Head by Bruce Willis Whether Wilee is being chased by Shannons unmarked cop car trying to catch up to competitive co-worker Manny (Wole Parks who with a bit more charisma could have made a mark here) or dodging the odd out-of-nowhere cab door the cycling action is consistently invigorating clearly relying on actual stunt work instead of CG (and recalling a time when that would have gone without saying). Although he cheats his geography from time to time (weaseling Harlems elevated train tracks into scenes set farther downtown say) Koepp clearly enjoys setting his action on actual NYC streets. For all the gains planners and activists have made in carving bike lanes into the citys grid its strangely comforting to see that some riders will always find exciting ways to make them unsafe.

"Premium Rush | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Premium Rush Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer barkerrant 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr August 23 2012 | 0700AM PT ""Premium Rush"" deftly straddles the line between stupid and clever for the entirety of its brisk running time. The lovably ridiculous bike-messenger thriller ""Premium Rush"" is a welcome throwback. In a film world where genre fare is elevated to the level of serious cinema and B-movie helmers have a penchant for self-aware irony they just dont make dumb movies like they used to. But ""Premium Rush"" deftly straddles the line between stupid and clever for the entirety of its brisk running time wearing its inessentiality on its sleeve and though B.O. will be modest the pic could thrive in its natural habitat as lazy Sunday cable fodder. Directed and co-scripted by frequent Steven Spielberg collaborator David Koepp (screenwriter on ""Jurassic Park"" ""War of the Worlds"" etc.) and starring Christopher Nolan muse Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the aptly named protag Wilee ""Premium Rush"" feels engineered to provide its principals with a bit of a breather between shouldering blockbusters. Its clear that everyone involved from cast to crew understands the inherent silliness of the material but while the film never tries to introduce any undue seriousness into the proceedings it never winks at them either earnestly embracing the idea that Manhattans kamikaze corps of bicycle messengers exists as a band of Kerouackian urban pirates. Spending the vast majority of his screentime sweating atop a bicycle Wilee is a former law student who fancies himself a samurai of the bike-messenger trade perilously weaving through traffic on a fixed-gear all-steel model with no brakes. Lest the danger of the job escape audiences the film opens on Wilees flailing body hurtling through the air in slow-motion after a collision immediately flashing back to several hours prior. (The relentlessly non-chronological film is full of onscreen clocks maps and text messages which however chintzy greatly reduce the need for expositional ballast.) Embroiled in some pre-existing drama with fellow messenger and girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) who herself seems to be taking a fancy to another co-worker the jockish Manny (Wole Parks) Wilee had taken on a mysterious delivery earlier in the day agreeing to shepherd an envelope from Vanessas roommate Chinese exchange student Nima (Jamie Chung) across the borough to a Chinatown dive. Immediately intercepted by a sweaty malevolent detective (Michael Shannon) whos keen to recover the envelope Wilee takes off on a street chase that will essentially constitute the rest of the film further complicating things by attracting the attention of a dogged accident-prone bike cop (Christopher Place). Through all the time-jumping and nonstop pedaling (even Bradley Wiggins would struggle to keep pace with this crew) a story eventually emerges involving organized crime immigrant smuggling and the perils of Pai Gow poker addiction with hints of a ""Chinatown""-esque skeleton in Wilees closet explaining his curious aversion to brakes. Paying attention to this irregularly unfolding narrative is entirely optional however and not particularly recommended as the film never pauses long enough to linger. Most of the actors exude a general laissez-faire attitude throughout -- even Gordon-Levitts bloody real-life crash during filming is played for laughs in the closing credits -- though Shannon takes the opportunity to consume every inch of scenery with ferocious gusto. Marble-mouthed to the extent that he renders ""uncooperative"" as a two-syllable word he manages to evoke a slightly cuddlier version of Gary Oldmans schizoid cop in ""Leon the Professional."" In the early going the film does well to exploit the anarchic geography of downtown Manhattan for a series of setpieces though it runs out of ideas toward the end eventually dispensing with all attempts at creativity and simply dropping huge cranes and balance beams into its cyclists paths. In the films most eye-rolling gimmick Wilee weaves through traffic by essentially stopping time and visualizing all possible routes through traffic a la Guy Ritchies ""Sherlock Holmes""; never are the films budgetary limitations more apparent.

Different people have different theories but for me it is simple - if a lead can take what is ultimately silly script and support it on the strengths of his charms he is a movie star. If someone can take a generic character and turn him into one of the great funny-yet-sinister villains with just some outrageous line readings and funny faces he is a great character actor. ""Premium Rush"" has both and proves yet again how vibrant Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Shannon are on the film scene today. JGL plays Wilee (like the coyote) the baddest bike messenger in the city. He went to Columbia University to study law (so we know hes smart) but he dropped out before taking the bar (so we know hes an individual) and he says things like ""the bike wants to go fast"" and ""brakes mean death"" (so okay hes a bit of a yutz). Luckily there isnt much talking in ""Premium Rush."" But there is a ridiculous amount of high speed bike-riding action through a fairy tale Manhattan that ought to scratch the itch of any cycling enthusiast as well as folks who like to believe New York is loaded with nothing but crabby people who say ""youse guys"" a lot. With the entire city as his personal velodrome nothing gets between Wilee and his destination not even a bug-eyed crooked cop (Shannon) trying to intercept a curious package before it gets to Chinatown. After a series of time jumps (the movie all takes place in one afternoon but not in straight order) we learn that a postage stamp-sized MacGuffin has to get downtown by 7 oclock or a moppety little boy is going to be stuck in the rain in a totalitarian state. And once it becomes personal neither broken ribs nor an oft-delayed race with his personal workplace rival is going to prevent him from getting there on time. In addition to propulsive camerawork with extra doses of zoom-zoom ""Premium Rush"" has a few marvelous tricks up its sleeve. Racing neck and neck for most exciting is JGLs ""cyclist-vision"" wherein he can see beyond red lights and visualize the safest path in a Google Maps compliant route. Its like the ""Sherlock Holmes"" gag only... faster (And at times intentionally funny.) Also uproarious is Shannons Detective Monday. From his very first line (introducing himself as ""Forrest J. Ackerman"") he is a thick chocolatey shake of unexpected choices that would make Christopher Walken (or Ricardo Montalban) proud. He sounds like Michael Corleone during the scenes when his jaw was busted. He also has time to rail against inappropriate cusswords on network TV or ""what the HR shrink says"" between slapping people around. It is a triumphant bit of the over-the-top ridiculousness and I pray that 50% of it was ad-lib. For three wonderful years I ""worked the streets"" in New York City. That has a bit of a nasty connotation but what it means really is that I was outside in the elements and dealing with the other loonies who refuse to stay indoors all day. Yeah I was just a tour guide walking school groups from Rockefeller Center to the Museum of Natural History but that I still recognize ""Premium Rush""s lust for the chaos of New Yorks exuberant spirit. Maybe if you spend enough time out there you really can find a cop who shouts ""keep yuh arms inside the bus"" when they are pointing and shouting ""he went thatta way"" Grade B Movies Premium Rush News about FAQ/Help Jobs Terms of Use Privacy Policy/Privacy Rights Copyright Closed Captioning Eventful Partners Ad Choices (c)2016 Viacom International Inc.

Lets just be glad Smell-O-Vision never caught on.Thankfully the musky odor of sweaty bike messengers doesnt emanate from ""Premium Rush"" an enjoyable two-wheeled action film and flashy ode to the subculture of urban couriers.Its a silly movie predicated on a simple premise but ""Premium Rush"" is satisfying B-movie entertainment that moves with the swiftness of a Schwinn -- a ride made fun particularly by Michael Shannons enthrallingly comic performance as a dirty cop in mad pursuit of a bike messengers cargo.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Wilee a hardened New York City messenger whos forsaken a promising career in law for the freedom of riding the citys congested streets. His dispatch (Aasif Mandvi) sends him on a seemingly innocuous delivery picking up an envelope at Columbia University to be dropped off in Chinatown before 7 p.m.Like any self-respecting NYC bike messenger Wilee rides a fixed-gear bike meaning theres one speed and no brakes -- the more hardcore and aesthetically appealing way to ride. ""Brakes are death"" is his mantra. He revels in the art of traffic navigation pinpointing routes through red lights sidewalks and crosstown lanes.Director and co-writer David Koepp is best known as a screenwriter of blockbusters like ""Spider-Man"" and ""Jurassic Park"" but who has sometimes directed -- like the underrated Ricky Gervais comedy ""Ghost Town."" In ""Rush"" he charts Wilees paths with a ""Cash Cab""-like map and represents his split-second decision-making with visualizations of disastrous alternatives (like veering left and sideswiping a stroller).But Wilees pedal artistry is severely tested when a man (Michael Shannon) attempts to intercept his delivery and aggressively pursues him down the West Side. His motivation is initially unclear but Koepp fills the film with flashbacks to earlier in the day for exposition.Such time-shifting is often a clunky technique but Koepp assembles the backstories without hitting too many potholes. The man Wilee soon learns is a police officer named Bobby Monday. In flashbacks we learn that his Pai Gow habit and his temper have gotten him in deep with Chinatown gamblers. Hes caught wind of Wilees shipment -- an envelope with a ticket good for 50000 -- and hunts it recklessly.There are other backstories too Wilee is feuding with his girlfriend Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) a fellow messenger whom he fears could be lured by his courier rival the beefy Manny (Wole Parks).As Wilee -- whose name is meant to evoke the coyote albeit with the Road Runners knack for escape -- careens through the city hes also pursued by a bike cop (stuntman Christopher Place) in a variety of chase scenes. One takes place below an elevated subway evoking a smidge of ""The French Connection.""But is cycling ready for its close-up? ""Premium Rush"" arrives with some timeliness a kind of victory lap for the countrys growing cycling culture and New Yorks increasingly bike-friendly streets. Wilees Wild West and his trusty steed are in some ways behind the curve as Mayor Bloomberg has largely tamed the Manhattan grid with color-coded bike paths. Classic movie chase scenes are nearly all of the automotive variety. In one of Shannons many fine moments he curses disgustedly at such flimsy prey a mere bicycle. But the numerous pursuit sequences -- which are a long way from Paul Newman riding to ""Rain Drops Keep Fallin on My Head"" in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" -- are largely riveting. Koepp filmed them without the aid of visual effects and the precarious unarmored position of a cyclist adds to the thrill There is skin in the game.Gordon-Levitt a wonderful young actor carries the film easily and does well to capture the gritty underdog mentality of the bike messenger. (For more on New Yorks couriers see the 2001 documentary ""Pedal."")But its Shannon who doesnt just steal the film he towers over it. One of the finest actors around Shannons gifts are best witnessed on the stage or in last years excellent ""Take Shelter."" He is far more than a great heavy but he is nevertheless a great heavy.His Detective Monday is a combination of desperation and exasperation a wide-eyed maniac impatient with rage but not so impatient to make the kind of clever deranged asides Christopher Walken would appreciate. Without him ""Premium Rush"" is a passable diversion that mostly keeps in the defined lanes of an action film.But its course is entirely unpredictable whenever Shannon is on screen. A New Yorker himself Shannon gives the film -- which sometimes uses the city as merely a race track -- much of its local flavor. When he screams ""This whole city hates you"" at the bikers hes channeling a real gripe.In a two-tire film hes an 18-wheeler.""Premium Rush"" a Columbia Pictures release is rated PG-13 for some violence intense action sequences and language.

"Premium Rush review A daredevil really delivers - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Premium Rush A daredevil really delivers  1/2August 23 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie critic""Premium Rush"" is great fun -- nimble quick the thinking persons mindless entertainment. In the same week of ""Hit amp; Run"" which offers only meager escapism in a high-velocity realm director and co-writer David Koepps thriller about a bicycle messenger pedaling for his life up and down and across Manhattan delivers a bracing corrective. On two wheels only Fours for losers.Like the recent ""Source Code"" Koepps script co-written by John Kamps treats time and space as elastic story components and flashbacks as opportunities for invention not just exposition. ""Premium Rush"" is propelled by Wilee (pronounced ""wily"") a star in the NYC bike messenger universe played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. His conveyance of choice is a stripped-down cycle of nervy simplicity no brakes no gears.The pays not much. ""Eighty bucks on a good day"" as Wilee narrates to us. (Wisely the screenwriters confine the voice-overs to the beginning and the end of the picture.)A Columbia University law school graduate Wilees a rebel uninterested in any cubicle-based employment. ""Runnin reds killin peds"" -- thats the life for him he cracks though his fellow messenger and sometime lover Vanessa (Dania Ramirez) wonders if hes reckless to a fault. Near the start Wilee gets a ""premium rush"" order to deliver an envelope from Vanessas roommate (Jamie Chung) to a location in Chinatown. Inside the envelope is a marker for a considerable amount of money. A dirty cop with heavy gambling debts portrayed with relish by Michael Shannon has his reasons to intercept the delivery.And thats the plot -- Wilee pursued by a murderous bear of a detective as well as an NYPD bike cop out to teach the messengers a lesson in manners.Its plot covering a few hours in the life of Wilee the 90-minute film does not stint on gimmicks. Three times director Koepp presents us with visual segments in which Wilee speeding through a potentially deadly intersection runs what-if? scenarios in his head depicted on screen. (The Guy Ritchie ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies work similar speculative games.) GPS-style mapping of Wilees latest route through the snarl of Manhattan comes to life on screen. Some of this is too fancy too much. But one of the pleasures of ""Premium Rush"" besides a crafty and well-told story is its determined lack of green-screen and digital effects work. Most of the insanity looks vaguely humanly possible. An impressive cadre of stunt riders earned their keep on the film and Gordon-Levitt got racked up pretty good during the shoot as we see in footage tucked inside the end credits.The movie itself boasts speed and a sense of humor and Shannon nets some lovely unexpected laughs with his increasingly desperate detectives topsy-turvy vocal inflections. The script makes everybody either smart a smartass or both. This is rare; too many movies of various levels of ambition settle for writing idiots and jerks. (See ""Hit amp; Run."") To be sure ""Premium Rush"" does not encourage safe riding practices in heavily populated urban areas. But Gordon-Levitt wiry and intense and the equally game (and gorgeous) Ramirez look swell together. And thats while wearing bike helmets like all good death-defying cyclists should.mjphillipstribune.comPremium Rush -- 3 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for some violence intense action sequences and language)Running time 131Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesClergy On A Mission Of The MindApril 24 1994Ghost Town stars Ricky Gervais Tea Leoni and Greg KinnearSeptember 19 2008Actress has made a home hereAugust 13 2010James H.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Premium Rush Joseph Gordon-Levitt Pedals Furiously to Film Stardom The most likable guy in indie films -- and Christopher Nolans favorite movie mensch -- becomes an action hero on two wheels in this far-fetched fun adventure By Richard Corliss Aug. 23 2012 Share Read Later Sarah Shatz / Columbia Pictures-Sony / APJoseph Gordon-Levitt in a scene from ""Premium Rush."" Premium Rush Year 2012 Director David Koepp Studio Columbia Pictures Actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt Michael Shannon Dania Ramirez Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture A New York Times survey this week found that 66% of the citys residents approve of bicycle lanes on busy streets. Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the bike-messenger hero of Premium Rush doesnt. In his furious mission to break world records getting packages from sender to recipient he treats the traffic-clogged thoroughfares of Manhattan as his private demolition-derby course. He has no use for bike lanes -- for that matter lanes -- since hes as likely to pedal down a crowded sidewalk or the wrong way on a one-way street or over the roofs and hoods of closely parked cars. A dropout from Columbia Universitys law school Wilee has also renounced obeying or acknowledging the laws of the road. His only creed is speed ""Goin down Broadway at 50 with no brakes. ... What could be better than that?"" In the real New York City passengers and pedestrians might form a posse to bring a reckless rider like Wilee to justice. Considering Wilees many actual and near-collisions with taxis the movie could be called Crash Cab. Taking place on a work day at the peak of the rush hour (though the glut of cars is not as congested as it should be) the film takes such liberties with road courtesy and civilian safety that closing credit should read ""With gratitude and apologies to New York City."" (READ Corlisss tribute to Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 50/50) But David Koepp the director of Premium Rush would probably tell you that collateral damage is one of the unwritten rules of action films; the little people on the periphery of a car chase are just toys to be brushed away with a second or first thought. He and cowriter John Kamps (who also collaborated on the 2008 Ghost Town) have taken old movies about outlaw motorcycle gangs like The Wild One and The Wild Angels stripped the rooting interest down to one determined man and given him a different vehicle. At the end of the Sept. 1954 Mad comic book parody of The Wild One Marlon Brandos gang do just that; as one onlooker says ""The motorcycle crazies are now bicycle crazies"" Wilee is the bicycle crazy as solitary hero. (READ Corlisss review of David Koepps Ghost Town) His job this afternoon pick up a package from a Columbia student and deliver it to a storefront in Chinatown within an hour and a half. As any New Yorker could tell you thats easy. Take the southbound No. 1 train at 116th Street just outside the Universitys main campus to 42nd Street; switch to the Q or R line and get off at Canal Street; then walk or pedal six short blocks east and two blocks south to your destination at 147 Doyers Street. Probable elapsed time 30 mins. (Your only frustration would be in discovering that there is no 147 on the streets one block; the numbers dont get higher than 30.) But Premium Rush is as you must keep reminding yourself a movie where geography plausibility and road courtesy must all bow to the need to keep the story churning and the wheels spinning. (READ Joel Steins interview with Joseph Gorden-Levitt by subscribing to TIME) The Columbia student Nima (Jamie Chung) is a roommate of Wilees girlfriend and fellow bike messenger Vanessa (the lusciously muscular Dania Ramirez). Whatever is the envelope shes given Wilee has attracted the attention of a lawman who identifies himself suspiciously as Forrest J. Ackerman but is in fact a screw-loose NYPD detective named Bobby Monday (Michael Shannon in full frustration-fulmination mode). Wilee refuses to hand over the envelope and scoots away from Monday. Cue the chase which lasts the same as the movies 90-plus mins. occasionally interrupted for flashbacks explaining who owes what to whom. (READ Michael Shannon as one of the Great Performers of 2008) In one of their few face-to-face meetings Monday notes that the biker is named for Wile E. Coyote of the Warner Bros. cartoons. In fact thats the role Monday is assigned while his prey is as the elusive Road Runner. It takes the cop a while to realize that. ""Chasin a bike -- eh eh"" he barks. Oh yeah? A guy in a car chasing a guy on a bike through the most auto-hostile city in America which one has the greater mobility? And who can go places forbidden to the other? Again a local would have advised Wilee to take the miles-long no-car bike lane along the Hudson River. And if Monday crashes that green-city party Wilee might shout to passersby ""This maniac is trying to kill me"" But that would be too simple for a movie that wants to display the daredevil expertise of parkour on wheels. Think Speed Racer but without rules or engines. (READ Corlisss contrarian rave for Speed Racer) The plot bears some similarities to Joe Quirks 1999 novel The Ultimate Rush set in San Francisco and with a messenger who uses rollerblades not a bike but who gets tangled in mysterious deliveries and the Chinese mob. (Rush has sued the movie for copyright infringement.) Well let the lawyers sort that one out and just say that -- for all the post-film questions that might trouble a viewer especially one whos lived in Manhattan -- the movie is a vivid crowd-pleasing B movie whose mechanics probably shouldnt be taken as seriously as I have. It also has some cool moments in which Wilee instantly gauges the least hurtful route through an intersection. (The third route is always the safe one until -- whack -- it isnt.) (READ Corliss on Joseph Gordon-Levitt in (500) Days of Summer) Wilee may be a madman but hes an ingratiating one as well because hes played by Gordon-Levitt the child actor (3rd Rock from the Sun) who has matured into Christopher Nolans favorite mensch (in Inception and The Dark Knight Rises) and the smiling poster boy for indie films. So appealing is Gordon-Levitt that for great stretches of his new movie I suspended my disapproval of his character and just went with the nonstop flow. He almost persuaded me that the film is if not a premium rush then an economy high.

Share Tweet In David Koepps hugely entertaining thriller Premium Rush Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as a bike messenger named Wilee nickname ""Coyote."" Right up front Koepp is telling the audience what kind of movie theyre going to get a nonstop chase full of blown schemes slipped traps and madcap humor in the spirit of a Roadrunner cartoon. Only Gordon-Levitt isnt the Wile E. Coyote in this scenario. That role falls to the transcendently silly Michael Shannon playing a crooked cop who always thinks he has the drop on the Roadrunner but usually winds up with an anvil dropped on his head. Hes Premium Rushs villain but Shannon doesnt attempt anything like the austere derangement of a Hans Gruber type even though he specializes in playing terrifying nutjobs. Instead hes a buffoon of the first order and his hapless tomfoolery sets the tone for a light fast frequently hilarious 90 minutes. Unfolding more or less in real time--Koepp fiddles with the chronology too much to make it official--Premium Rush follows Gordon-Levitt as he darts through Manhattan on a messenger bike with a fixed gear and no brakes. He takes an envelope from a university student who wants him to dash it over to Chinatown gravely stressing the importance of the task. As soon as Gordon-Levitt gets on his bike Shannon confronts him claiming he needs the envelope for police business. In the first of many feints to come Gordon-Levitt gives Shannon the slip and heads across town not expecting that this supposed campus cop will be trying to run him over minutes later. The contents of the envelope are clarified later as are Shannons hilariously pathetic reasons for coveting it but its mostly a MacGuffin a thin excuse for the tires to meet the pavement. Koepp wants to capture the immediacy of bike messengers zipping through hostile territory but Premium Rush has an arcade elasticity thats a few stops removed from reality. In a clever touch he slows down the action in dangerous situations and charts the various paths Gordon-Levitt can take to get out of trouble--like a split-second Choose Your Own Adventure where two options end in bloody catastrophe and a third is a needle-thread to safety.
