Written and co-produced by war reporter Mark Boal (who worked on Paul Haggiss In the Valley of Elah) Bigelows film combines an expert management of tension with a sensitive and journalistic attention to detail she has one eye on the truth and the other on the multiplex and if you can forgive her the odd sentimental or sensational flourish this makes for an unusual mix of the thrilling and the sobering.The films focus is a bomb disposal squad in Baghdad in 2004 and the 38-day rotation of Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner pictured) an expert in defusing devices and a mouthy renegade whom you could view as either hot shit as one superior calls him or deserving of a sock in the jaw as one of his peers prefers. Bigelow builds suspense and empathy by sticking closely to this small band through several episodes - including one superbly executed desert gunfight - and allowing us to experience events as they unfold for the soldiers. The photography from United 93 DoP and regular Ken Loach collaborator Barry Ackroyd lends a frenetic immediacy to proceedings while the use of Amman as Baghdad lends context and reality to a claustrophobic story. Bigelow is more interested in psychology than politics but she shows just enough awareness of how the behaviour of soliders can fuel retaliation and even includes one direct suggestion that the US Army can and does choose to disregard the welfare of civilians. Most encouragingly the film offers a fine distinction between heroism and heroics.Click here to read an interview with director Bigelow By Dave Calhoun Posted Tuesday August 25 2009 Details Release details Rated 15 Release date Friday August 28 2009 Duration 131 mins Cast and crew Director Kathryn Bigelow Screenwriter Mark Boal Cast Jeremy RennerAnthony MackieBrian GeraghtyGuy PearceRalph FiennesDavid MorseEvangeline Lilly Users say (28) 4 out of 5 stars Average User Rating3.7 / 5Rating Breakdown5 star94 star33 star02 star51 star0LiveReviews|281 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshNov 14 2010Robert ThorntonFeaturedCanaEUR(tm)t understand why this film got an Oscar must have been political. Other than seeing bomb disposal there was little else that was new many of the scenes were in aEURoeJarheadaEUR like coming across the aEURoeenemyaEUR in the desert sniping with your buddy as telescopic look out counting days to go. I would like to get a military critic to review all recent American war films as do all soldiers react in a totally uncontrolled manner like 6 soldiers firing aimlessly together at a target disobedience to orders shouting in English at an Arab who canaEUR(tm)t speak English. What was the scene about when the hero bomb disposer decided to seek out the person who detonated the truck as he guessed it wasnaEUR(tm)t a suicide bomber who did it. Other than getting his buddy killed what did he expect to find? Why did aEURoeBeckhamaEUR have a bomb inside him was this to be detonated by someone. I could go on as I would have expected this Oscar winning to be much more credible.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 13 2010tewkewlFeaturedto those of you who are saying that they were not SAS. you guys dont know jack. The SAS Delta DevGru were charged with seeking out and capturing terrorist big shots. remember the deck of most wanted cards? Contractors were not tasked to get them. The big giveaway is the fact that they call in for air support. Contractors dont call in for military air support. Soldiers can get bonuses for capturing hotshots too. This movie was made by someone who is used to being a hollywood liberal... for an audience with know knowledge of the military. An SAS team being pinned down by Hajis from a KNOWN sniper position? Im sorry this is not realistic. Even more so they get saved by a sniping EOD tech? give me a break. Sure the main Character was a ranger so its believable he went to sniper school but Sanborne sniping? highly unrealistic. but the libs watching this movie have no idea. they just think ""pow pow.. guns shooting... army men... all the same"". And 3 EOD guys running around by themselves? Unsupported? Im sorry the EOD guys dont come in until the area is secured and cordoned off. And the main tech going around without procedures or not using the BOT when they have it? totally absurd. I wanted to like this movie. But that SAS scene just pushed it over the top. This is liberal hollywood fiction not a war movie. For accurate depictions watch blackhawk down (somalia) saving private ryan (ww2) taegukki the brotherhood of war (korean war) hamburger hill (vietham). this movie is a disgrace.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 8 2010HFeaturedI absolutely agree with NJW. I was expecting big things from The Hurt Locker but having seen Generation Kill it pales miserably in comparison. OK we only spend a couple of hours with the guys in this film compared to seven or so with the tv series lot but Gen.Kill is the first time Ive ever understood why anyone would want to join the Marines. The authenticity of the show (writing direction dilemmas language camaraderie frustration politics) is insightful innovative and outstandingly executed. Apart from one or two exceptional moments in The Hurt Locker (the desert shoot-out sniper part in particular) I really cant say the same for it.

Guy Pearce makes a brief cameo in the opening sequence as it ends in tragic detail and than the narrative follows through in a well edited -handheld camera technique where we are taken through the harrowing experiences of an american team . as they tackle the bombs we also become implicitly aware of the flaws where the leader wants to manually disarm IEDS [INTRA EXPLOSIVE DEVICES ]though it is policy to let the robot perform that task this obviously makes turgid drama but it is imprecise too and the security measures or protocols are butchered at times as ordinary taxi drivers drive into the middle of forays in intense barricades . At times this is inadvertently absurd and at times you see the iraqis watching as zombies while the americans expose themselves like sitting ducksit is never asserted whether the civilians are hostile or friendly or what they might deem of this circus in their backyards and doorsteps . One gesture of friendship to Sanborn is rudely snubbed by the Afro-american who tells the Iraqi man to fuck off  but James is rather diffident as he befriends a young guy who is allowed in the base to sell pirated dvds and play ball and is called Beckham which is the only lighter aspect of this grim account . soon they are off into a patrol in the desert in shimmering golden sand dunes with panoramic shots and first encounter a british patrol in plainclothes where Ralph Fiennes makes his special appearance and vanishes in the blink of an eye as an iraqi insurgent ambush ensues which is again staged with flaws as the iraqis have no strategic sense compared to their entrapped american counterparts who shoot them down like pigeons . Bigelow has tried her level best to devise an accurate account of a war which is not conventional neither patriotic but a mercenary misadventure but she is no KUBRICK and this is no FULL METAL JACKET where a harmonious balanced account of all the characters can be rendered in exquisite emotional and visual wizardry . she meanders as she sends her leading man unnecessarily on a nocturnal adventure in the middle of nowhere in a hostile metropolis alone as he breaks into an iraqi house against all rules in search of the murderers who have killed his soccer buddy . Yet she than stages a powerful sequence which redeems her and the movie where a hapless iraqi citizen appears in a public square with a bomb soldered on him begging to be salvaged while the americans bicker as to whether he ought to be terminated or aided as the scene progresses you almost step into the shoes and soul of this iraqi man chanting the quran as he awaits his irrevocable fate and the tragedy that is iraq is reverberatingly captured in this haunting echo as he recites the KALMA . this is rather an uneven movie very well acted and edited shot with precision in a neo-real mode with vicarious techniques where a controversial war and its most vicious aspect of suicide and roadside bombs are explored in a sporadically affective sum of fears . The fact remains that the portrayal of James and Sanborn as the two leads is also haunted by their own scepticism and frustration as they mock wrestle in their quarters and james loses control in a well directed sequence where he physically and verbally abuses his peer. This is a true revelation of the ugly emotions evoked by war and one wishes miss Bigelow had dwelled more on this psychological aspect than the toys and devices that her camera follows while briefly lingering on the expressionless iraqi populace . In one sequence a senior american officer fecilitates james on his skills and demands imperiously to know the quantity of bombs he has tackled and how he has managed to survive . The reply in so many words sums up the net affect -i cannot remember truly the number but the best way to defuse them is the safe way . I wish that miss Bigelow had not followed the safe route of making a comfortable movie about a crucial subject and delved into some unknown territory in her iraqi expedition to visit and explore a place colloquially referred by the yanks as the sandbox where human blood and life are cheaper than the sand itself which is partially and equivocally explored here from a hollywood perspective without describing the human condition in its vast scope or its perilous status in contemporary global milieu  showcasing style over content in a pretentious artistic movie to appeal to critics and their whims . 7/10FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 25 2010critiqueFeaturedWell constructed but didn`t absorb me.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 21 2010RogueFeaturedCouldnt disagree more with the other reviewers that characterisation was weak. The interplay between James and Sanborn was excellent and even the few minutes you get at the beginning with Sanborn and Thompson tells you a lot about the characters involved. The film was relentlessly suspenseful and felt like a true representation of the horror of desert warfare instead of a Hollywood-ised shoot em up where the Americans simply blast their way through everything with a pulse before patting themselves on the back at the end This is not about making a political statement (although it does contain elements of this of course) but about the individuals involved in what our governments created.

Action ok occasionally some real suspense - as youd expect with bomb disposal. But characterisation weak scripting occasionally truly terrible ""I havent got a son. Id like a little boy. How did you do it?"". Desert shootout has totally unconvincing mockney Brits who get shot much more easily than the US boys. And then they spend an age watching a building thats clearly empty.

The set-pieces are very good (though the desert shootout was spoiled by Ralph Fienness usual plywood performance) but I found little else to engage. The characters didnt inspire empathy and the bit with the Beckham kid was sentimentally out of place. The film wouldve been much improved if the tone had been more blackly comic (like Buffalo Soldiers) while retaining a sharper political edge. Im glad that people are watching a film about the war in Iraq; its just a pity that THL comprises thrills and suspense and not much else.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 10 2009Andy SFeaturedAbsolutely brilliant a gripping and tense masterpiece with stunning performances.

Lean mean comprised of multiple episodic parts some old and some new nothing too flashy or polished but deadly efficient. Bigelow deserves credit for not only for securing two effective ""unknowns"" as the leads but also the manner in which she transfers the tension relaying it cumatively from one episode to the next without ever making it actually feel episodic. Although Ive appreciated her very early work Ive never counted myself as a fan but her jaunt in the wilderness as really paid off here. Personally this is her finest hour or two. The ending of an astronaut plodding off into a world of quite possible death ranks up there with the best.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/85710/the-hurt-locker.html,200,thehurtlocker0,thehurtlocker,timeout
"The Hurt Locker | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    The Hurt Locker Print Page Email Page Search The Hurt Locker (2009; Rated ) A+ "" Unflinching raw look at war as a drug."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION The Hurt Locker(2009; R)In theaters Friday 26 June 2009 Summary Iraq. Forced to play a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse in the chaos of war an elite Army bomb squad unit must come together in a city where everyone is a potential enemy and every object could be a deadly bomb. Genre Action Drama Thriller WarDirector Kathryn BigelowCast Jeremy Renner ""The Hurt Locker"" is a war film set in present-day Iraq but it is not about the war in Iraq. It is about the universal soldier who becomes addicted to war. It is about war as a drug. It is about a man who goes home and is utterly lost in the grocery store----but completely comfortable dodging enemy fire and defusing bombs in brutal hostile conditions. It is a searing unforgettable film filled with unbearably tense set pieces and first-rate performances. Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal (who was embedded with a U.S. bomb-disposal squad in Iraq in 2004) have fashioned a gritty visceral slice of the insanely dangerous day-to-day operations of a squad of American soldiers that are risking their lives as regularly as you and I take a three-day weekend. (And they know full well that a huge percentage of the civilians back home think they shouldnt even be in Baghdad or are completely indifferent to their mission.) Bigelow veers close to glamorizing the bloodshed with her penchant for ear-splitting rock and roll and her admittedly impressive slow-motion shots of explosions. But she also serves up horrific scenes of death and destruction that serve as a punch to the gut. Even if a soldier survives a war physically uninjured he does not emerge intact. We follow the day-to-day routines of an elite bomb squad that has 38 days left in their rotation. In the opening scene where the squad uses a rolling bot to sniff out a bomb on a busy street in Baghdad were sure something wont happen because of an element I dont want to divulge here----and yet it happens anyway. From that moment Bigelow serves notice. Were in for a hellacious ride. Jeremy Renner isnt 1/10th as famous as many of his peers but hes got much more of a star presence and better chops than just about any pretty boy actor you can think of. Renner commands the screen here in a performance worthy of a young Russell Crowe. His Sgt. James is a classic conflicted deeply flawed hero. Swaggering macho----but not a caricature. Extremely good at what he does----but the antithesis of the team player. James has defused more than 800 bombs and he keeps the switches in a box under his bed noting that these cheap pieces of plastic and wire could have killed him in others in a heartbeat. At times his bravery crosses the line into death-wish territory----but hes not dead inside. He strikes up a friendship with an Iraqi boy and hes conflicted about the estranged wife and young son hes left behind. (Evangeline Lilly from ""Lost"" has an effective cameo as the wife. We also get brief but memorable turns from Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes.) The underrated Anthony Mackie is brilliant here as a hardened vet who has moments of intense doubt. Brian Geraghty has the Jeremy Davies thing down pat as a good-hearted but brittle soldier who has post-traumatic stress syndrome written all over his future. There isnt a weak performance in this film. Although its not quite in the same league as ""Coming Home"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" this movie strikes similar themes about the huge chasm separating the maddening adrenaline rush of the war experience and the beautiful banality of everyday home life. When a civilian sees a war veteran in a bar or on a bus in the States and the vet is staring into space or acting strangely we might think of him as cliche. Get over it we think. When we see that veteran through Bigelows eyes were amazed that anyone returning home from these experiences can achieve even moments of ""normalcy."" This is one of the best films of the year.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie Review The Hurt Locker -- 4 out of 5 stars The Hurt Locker Jeremy Renner left and Anthony Mackie are shown in a scene from ""The Hurt Locker."" Jeremy Renner left and Anthony Mackie are shown in a scene from ""The Hurt Locker."" Roger MooreSentinel Staff Writer Kathryn Bigelow a director who made her mark on adrenaline-junkie fare such as Point Break finds her ultimate subject in the men stuck in The Hurt Locker bomb disposal experts working the deadly streets of Iraq. This beyond-the-headlines war movie a ""ticking clock"" thriller from journalist-turned-screenwriter Mark Boal (In the Valley of Elah) is the first Iraq War movie to qualify as more first-rate entertainment than sermon.Bravo Company has barely 30 days left In Country. Then Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie terrific) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) meet their worst nightmare. Their new tech the fellow who runs the robot that checks out suspicious packages isnt a fan of the ""the bot."" He isnt a take-his-time ""lets be careful out there"" type. The moment Will James (Jeremy Renner in a break-out performance) swaggers into harms way in his Michelin Man bomb-resistant suit Sanborn gets him. ""Reckless.""Eldridge has seen enough death to become obsessed with it and be blunt ""Hes gonna get me killed."" The film entertainingly trots through standard war movie situations and some situations specific to the Iraq War. Every ""mission"" is a tense race between bomber and bomb squad which has to outsmart the bad guy before more bad guys -- snipers -- show up. One trip outside their urban operating area turns particularly bloody as the team joining some British commandos ( Ralph Fiennes is their leader) is caught in a muscle-and-nerve fraying sniper duel in the middle of the desert.Hurt drags us into one paralyzing trap after another deadly sweaty work under the vengeful eyes of a populace staring down from windows above any one of whom can hold a rifle or a cell phone that sets off the bomb and kills them suit or no suit. The dynamics of the ""unit"" may be familiar -- the sergeant determined to keep his men alive the ""grunt"" who is under the company psychologists care. But Renner and the script create a character of surprising depth as James slowly reveals what he is really about his blind spots.War movie cliches aside Hurt Locker is revealing and action-packed with nervy combat scenes that will make you flinch. And the splendid cast will make you care about soldiers doing the most dangerous job on Earth in the deadliest place to do it.See for yourself The Hurt Locker 4 out of 5 starsCast Jeremy Renner Anthony Mackie Guy Pearce David Morse Ralph Fiennes.Director Kathryn Bigelow.Running time 2 hours 10 minutes.Industry rating R for war violence and language.

The Hurt Locker Director Kathryn Bigelow. Cast Jeremy Renner Anthony Mackie Brian Geraghty. Rating R for war violence and language. Note At Harkins Camelview. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Renner gains respect for GIs hellish job Lockers early Oscar talk Kathryn Bigelows ""The Hurt Locker"" shows us that too but it shows us something else about war its addictive nature. To drive the point home the film opens with this quote ""War is a drug."" And a powerful one indeed. Dont take this to mean that this is a pro-war film an exercise in cheerleading for going into battle. To the extent that such a thing is possible its apolitical more of a character study with a lot of explosions. Only in this case the characters are soldiers. Not just any soldiers. ""The Hurt Locker"" follows a bomb-disposal unit in Iraq in 2004. The work is incredibly intense off-the-charts dangerous the kind of thing where as we learn in the films first scene anything can go wrong at any time. The film follows soldiers in the unit as they complete the final 38 days of their rotation. Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) have survived a blast but their leader hasnt. Hes replaced by Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) whose brilliance at defusing explosives is matched only by his cowboy persona. James is a wild card an adrenaline junkie the kind of guy who when he discovers that a car trunk is full of bombs starts shedding his protective suit which looks like a cross between a spacesuit and an old-time diving outfit. Sanborn and Eldridge are stunned. What in the world is he thinking? Simple James explains. There are enough explosives in that trunk to kill everyone anyway. If hes going to die hes going to be comfortable. That kind of thinking - that kind of action - can be fatal something that Sanborn and Eldridge know as well as anyone. Its so dangerous in fact that they start to wonder whether it would be wiser and safer to cut their losses and plan a well-timed fatal accident. It sounds like an unthinkable idea but these men are in an unthinkable situation. Thats made clear among other ways by their off-duty behavior. How do you wind down after risking your life again in a job with no margin for error? Perhaps you draw targets on each others stomachs and see who can hit them the hardest. At least youre controlling the violence and pain. James keeps under his cot a box containing bits of the bombs he has dismantled all reminders of how good he is at his job - and that any one of these things could have killed him. You do what you need to do to survive. Mackie as the by-the-book Sanborn and Geraghty as the unsure Eldridge are also good as are Guy Pearce David Morse and especially Ralph Fiennes in small roles. But Renner is fantastic bringing many facets to James beyond just the wild man hurtling through a ridiculously difficult assignment. A brief stint back home tells us how difficult it can be to step away from a job you must live so intensely. Bigelows direction is confident - the action sequences are tense and suspenseful so much so that ""The Hurt Locker"" also works as a straight-up war film. But her ability to go past that to explore what makes men who willingly place themselves in incredibly difficult situations makes the movie so much more.

""Transformers"" sequel anyone? Then there are the explosions and the pervasive threat of them that make the ""The Hurt Locker"" directed by Kathryn Bigelow and written by Mark Boal the most intense and jarring experience of the summer thus far. It doesnt take long into the powerfully realized film about a bomb detonation squad working the dusty paranoia-tweaking streets of Baghdad in 2004 to assume we grasp the wounded poetry of the title. Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) enters a refrigerated warehouse to put personal effects into what looks like a meat freezer. (The phrase actually refers to ""a place of ultimate pain."") Earlier a three-man team of explosive experts eyes a mound from 100 yards out that is likely an improvised explosive device or IED. Its a danger-laden yet chatty opening. ""Im craving a hamburger"" says Sgt. Matt Thompson played with appealing ease by Guy Pearce as he suits up. War films have not done particularly well theatrically during our long years in Afghanistan and Iraq. This has made a kind of sorry sense. We want our comedies our escapist pleasures. Yet ""The Hurt Locker"" deserves and earns our rapt attention. The action is taut intelligent. Remember ""The Silence of the Lambs"" when FBI agent Clarice Starling finds herself in Buffalo Bills darkened lair? Now multiply those racked jitters by 10. Into this anxiety-infused space struts a cowboy of sorts. Jeremy Renner is remarkable as Staff Sgt. William James who becomes the Explosive Ordinance Disposal teams leader. Often he likes to disarm or detonate devices without the units equivalent of a net. For his two teammates this isnt simply maverick its death-courting. Sgt. Sanborn and Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) start to fear that James is more of a danger to the approaching end of their tour of duty than Iraqis who camouflage IEDs. The movie makes one of the most persuasive arguments for the logic of a friendly fire incident Ive seen. Mackie does his finest work in ages as the methodical cautious Sanborn. The script neither suppresses nor exploits the tensions between Sanborn who is black and James who flies his ""from the sticks"" flag with pride. Early on Geraghtys character dives into a well of self-recrimination and mortal fears that his smug shrink doesnt quite honor. With 38 days to go who wouldnt come to mistrust then despise a maverick like James. But the movie doesnt allow us easy judgments. Sgt. James has an infant son at home. He makes friends with a young jive-talking video hustler on base. He keeps mementos of his work which initially suggest trophies but have more complex meanings. If we describe Sgt. James as magnetic we mean he carries as powerful a negative charge as a positive one. New facets of his character are revealed when the team and a group of contract fighters headed by Ralph Fiennes are pinned down by snipers. Like the sun-bleached desert in this shoot-out the ruined streets of Baghdad suggest a Western. Yet much has has been written about the ways a war film is in fact a ""true"" horror movie. Bigelow and Boal -- who wrote the story for the upending war-comes-home story ""In the Valley of Elah"" -- get this. The miserably visceral exists here not as exploitation but out of the demands of authenticity. And the film counters many of our movie-trained expectations. Attachments formed between characters -- between audience and characters -- are extremely vulnerable. The filmmakers also embrace the power of this soldiers tale as a psychological thriller. ""The Hurt Locker"" delivers explosive unerring and shattering insights. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com. Also on blogs.denverpostcom/madmoviegoer ""THE HURT LOCKER.""

Comments (19) The Hurt Locker Recommended Video 2009 Kathryn Bigelows heart-stopping Iraq war drama (2009) follows a U.S. army bomb squad around Baghdad as it defuses IEDs a job that places the men in potentially deadly situations a dozen times a day. After the squads explosives expert is killed in action hes replaced by a shameless cowboy (Jeremy Renner) whose needless risk-taking infuriates his two partners (Anthony Mackie Brian Geraghty). Hes a true warrior but Bigelow defines that in terms of addiction; as one of the other soldiers points out he doesnt mind endangering them to get his daily ""adrenaline fix."" The war has already produced some excellent fiction films (The Lucky Ones In the Valley of Elah) but this is the first to dispense with the controversy surrounding the invasion and focus on the timeless subject of men in combat. Its the best war movie since Full Metal Jacket. With Ralph Fiennes and David Morse. R 130 min. By J.R.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Hurt Locker Drama. Starring Jeremy Renner Anthony Mackie Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow. (R. 131 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Director Kathryn Bigelows gender has always been an issue because she makes guy movies - and she makes them better than guys do. For most of her career her superior talent has had to reveal itself through lesser material but in the ""The Hurt Locker"" about a bomb disposal unit in Iraq Bigelow finds the perfect vehicle to show what she can do that others cant touch. Bigelow conveys the surface aspects of an action scene as well as any director working today. She can blow things up with the best of them but shes not McG who thinks that explosions make a movie. Bigelow is interested in the people in the midst of the trauma and its this quality Bigelows understanding of the psychological aspect of action that sets her apart. She uses handheld cameras in ""The Hurt Locker"" not to make viewers dizzy or to instill excitement that isnt there but to create a subtle sense of being alongside the characters. Her camera doesnt shake. It breathes. It pulses. The camera becomes the viewers eyes not those of a spastic cameraman. Through such intuitive means Bigelow takes an audience from the opening credits into a state of fierce attention and total empathy within about 60 seconds.

(AP Photo/Summit Entertainment Jonathan Olley)  NO SALES  Photo Jonathan Olley AP Review The Hurt Locker shows Bigelows skill 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Notice how quickly Bigelow conveys the charm and humanity of Guy Pearce a soldier called upon to neutralize a bomb in the movies first scene. Notice also how the direction and Mark Boals screenplay inject a workaday quality into this tense moment. Throughout ""The Hurt Locker"" the human element is central so that whenever something happens it feels personal. ""The Hurt Locker"" presents daily life within a bomb disposal unit showing how the men go out day after day identify improvised explosive devices and either deactivate them or blow them up within controlled areas. It shows the various roles that each member of the unit plays the routine the hierarchy and the stress involved in knowing as you wake up each morning that you might get blown to smithereens before lunch. But mainly ""The Hurt Locker"" concerns itself with the notion of war as addiction how for certain personalities the adrenaline rush of war becomes a drug. Jeremy Renner makes an indelible impression as Staff Sgt. James a man of average looks average stature average intelligence and average aspirations who thanks to the Iraq war finds out that he is one amazing soldier. He thrives on fear. The more dangerous things get the calmer and happier he gets. He loves defusing bombs and loves taking risks sometimes because theyre necessary and sometimes for the sake of taking them - and that line isnt always clear. He is contrasted with his two subordinates Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) who believes in caution and established procedure and Spc. Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) who is just a nice kid who wants to go home in one piece. Their personalities collide and combine over the course of increasingly dangerous missions. Throughout James remains a fascinating figure hard to pigeonhole. He gets off on the adrenaline yet thrives on it and arguably becomes a better soldier because of it. ""The Hurt Locker"" passes no judgment. Its interest is in war as a human phenomenon. In this way ""The Hurt Locker"" is the first Iraq war film with a postwar feeling. Its not about politics anymore but about a war that happened and what it was like. It was is different. Theres a battle scene one of the films best sequences unlike any youll find in a World War II or Vietnam movie. Soldiers clash but using long-range weapons telescopes and heat sensors. The terrors perils and consequences are the same and blood can still jam a weapon at the crucial moment. But the differences in technology call for differences in heroism - for calm precision and clear thinking. Usually a war has to be over for six or seven years for a movie to come along thats a real work of art. Weve had good and very good Iraq movies for several years now but ""The Hurt Locker"" has a fullness of understanding that sets it apart. On the day of its release this one enters the pantheon of great American war films - and puts Kathryn Bigelow into the top tier of American directors. -- AdvisoryThis film contains violence strong language and disturbing images.

At the Varsity. 14A Just when you thought the battle of Iraq war dramas had been fought and lost along comes one that demands to be seen - if you can handle the raging adrenaline.Kathryn Bigelows The Hurt Locker strips the politics from the Iraqi conflict and brings it down to the garbage-strewn pavement where lives are saved through skill and nerve but lost through bad luck and malevolence.Working a taut script by combat journalist Mark Boal the film follows the men of Bravo Company the elite U.S. army unit tasked with defusing bombs left on Baghdad streets by increasingly violent and determined insurgents.The bomb-removal boys have robots and shrapnel-resistant suits at their disposal but they cant stop every blast - as we see with devastating impact early on.The job ultimately comes down to playing hunches keeping your cool and staying ever vigilant. If the IED (improvised explosive device) doesnt get you the sniper hiding on a nearby rooftop just might. If not on this street then the next one.Gutsy and gung-ho but new to Bravo is Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) a reckless cowboy who has disarmed 873 bombs but is one short fuse away from being blown to kingdom come. He reminds himself of this with a collection of detonators he keeps under his bed.Renner is positively mesmerizing and sure to reverse previous harsh opinions about him. Most of his previous high-profile roles - playing Charlize Therons antagonist in North Country or serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in an earlier movie - have made him look downright despicable.This time hes the hero or rather the anti-hero in a Daniel Craig or Steve McQueen way.James Bravo Company subordinates Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are shocked by his methods and not shy about saying so. But theyre loyal to task and team.Testosterone flows non-stop and so does blood but these macho men are just getting the job done. In so doing they reveal much about themselves and also deliver some home truths about the Iraq conflict. This is no message movie yet insights abound.Bigelow knows the male mind and shes an ace at action as shes demonstrated before in films like Point Break and Strange Days. Now she can add titan of suspense to her laurels.If you can sit through The Hurt Locker without your heart nearly pounding through your chest you must be made of granite.Start the Oscar drumbeats now.(This is an updated version of a review originally published during the Toronto International Film Festival.)The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The actor was mistakenly identified as Jeremy Renner. Movies Movies Ann Hornaday Reviews The Hurt Locker a Great Iraq Thriller PHOTOS Previous          Next Guy Pearce portrays Sgt. Matt Thompson. (Ed Araquel -- Summit Entertainment Via Associated Press) Jeremy Renner as one of the soldiers who disarm roadside bombs in the taut war film. (Summit Entertainment) Anthony Mackie and Renner in the new film from Kathryn Bigelow which is set in Iraq but transcends the specifics of time and place. (Summit Entertainment) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 10 2009 ""War is a drug"" writes Christopher Hedges in the epigraph that precedes ""The Hurt Locker."" Someone else described war as ""interminable boredom punctuated by moments of stark terror."" Director Kathryn Bigelow comprehends both those observations and conveys them in this captivating completely immersive action thriller. ""The Hurt Locker"" just happens to be set in Iraq in 2004 but like the best films transcends time and place and in the process attains something universal and enduring. ""The Hurt Locker"" is about Iraq in the same way that ""Paths of Glory"" was about World War I or ""Full Metal Jacket"" was about Vietnam -- which is to say utterly and not at all. ""The Hurt Locker"" is a great movie period. This StoryMovies Locker Serves as Iraq Tour De ForceSeeing Through Mr. Tough GuyDiscuss A Wow Performance in Hurt LockerFind Showtimes TicketsSummer Movie GuideView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story In the opening scene a winsome little robot goes about its business in a dry and dusty place in an absorbing nearly dialogue-free sequence of startling visual eloquence. But this isnt your toddlers ""WALL E"" The mechanized creature is a device used for ferreting out bombs and when a wheel suddenly breaks that means one of the bots human counterparts must suit up slowly approach a pile of rubble and either find a bunch of trash or risk losing his life to an improvised explosive device. For the next two hours viewers are plunged into the dizzying disorienting world of the soldiers who disarm what Americans have come to know as IEDs or roadside bombs neither of which term does full justice to the carnage they inflict. The men leading the audience through those tense tautly orchestrated encounters are the soldiers of Bravo Company which as ""The Hurt Locker"" begins has 38 days to go in its rotation. Spec. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) is the mild-mannered nice guy who in a World War II movie most likely would have hailed from a farm in Iowa. Anthony Mackie plays Spec. J.T. Sanborn possessed of the somber watchful demeanor of a professional quietly observing protocol quite simply because observing protocol is the best way to stay alive. The groups leader -- and ""The Hurt Lockers"" charismatic often confounding protagonist -- is Staff Sgt. William James an adrenaline junkie and alpha dog played in an astonishing breakout performance by Jeremy Renner. ""Hes a rowdy boy"" Eldridge says with a tinge of admiration after he watches James make his ostentatiously swaggering debut with Bravo Company. ""Hes reckless"" says a studiously unimpressed Sanborn. Either way James is an irresistible central character a man who -- as brought to life by Renner with a tone-perfect combination of cocksure arrogance and baby-face guile -- is either captive to a pathological death wish or the embodiment of heroism at its most physically and mentally uncompromising. The dynamic among the three men -- as well as their uneasy relationships with Iraqi civilians -- heighten and heat up throughout ""The Hurt Locker"" which keeps its characters and by extension the audience on a jittery knife-edge between the chaos and control bravado and breakdown and threat and promise that define the life of a soldier. All those contradictions are alive and kicking in James who goes about his job with what seems to be an increasing sense of heedlessness. (During one of the films most excruciatingly suspenseful scenes James dismantles a car bomb without protective gear which was too hot and bulky for him to do the job; while Eldridge and Sanborn nervously keep watch over Iraqi civilians nearby every click of the wire clipper might deliver a lethal blow.) But just when his men are on the verge of dismissing (and possibly dispatching) James as a showboating cowboy he reveals yet another side. In the desert outside Baghdad they encounter a group of British gunmen whose leader suggests Lawrence of Arabia for a new mercenary age. Soon theyre embroiled in a confrontation with unseen snipers that will last for what seems like a dusty dehydrated eternity. Like every scene in ""The Hurt Locker"" this sequence is orchestrated by Bigelow with breathtaking skill conveying both boredom and terror in an unforgettable tableau of waiting watching killing and waiting again. From the blood-encrusted bullets Eldridge frantically spits on to make them usable to the tiny specks of dust that accumulate on Sanborns eyelashes while he patiently gazes through a rifle sight each detail begins to take on a singular almost hallucinatory life of its own. Its a world where the random and the routine seem engaged in a constant standoff of their own. ""The Hurt Locker"" owes much of its success to its script which was written by journalist Mark Boal after he was embedded with an elite Army explosive ordnance disposal squad for several weeks. These are clearly men whom Boal knows intimately (although a liberal psychologist named Cambridge seems almost too painfully earnest to be true) from their gallows-humor bonhomie to their whiskey-fueled pugilistic bonding sessions. But as authentic as Boals characters are it took a director of Bigelows sensitivity adroitness and sheer technical chops to bring them to life so completely. In such films as ""Near Dark"" and ""Point Break"" Bigelow has made something of a specialty of investigating subcultures mostly male that revolve around ritualized aggression and she has also progressively sharpened her filmmaking skills. With ""The Hurt Locker"" she has made the finest film of her career an exercise in pure cinema that tells its story using every visual aural and sensory element the medium has to offer. A former painter Bigelow approaches the screen like a canvas using the camera as an expressive instrument to bring viewers into an unknown and incomprehensible world. (""The Hurt Locker"" was filmed by Barry Ackroyd who shot Paul Greengrasss ""United 93"" with similar swerving immediacy using four hand-held cameras.) With an unerring sense of hair-trigger realism but an artists appreciation for composition gesture and rhythm Bigelow has created a movie that studiously avoids the kind of ax-grinding rhetoric and posturing that has made other Iraq-themed movies box-office poison. Instead she short-circuits polemic to create a by turns thrilling and terrifying experience one that muscles viewers straight into the action and keeps them there at least until their rotation is over. Bigelow orchestrates that transition with ingenuity in a penultimate sequence that perhaps more than any of the action that precedes it gets to the soldiers sense of purpose and inevitable dislocation. When viewers are ultimately released from ""The Hurt Lockers"" exhilarating vice grip theyll find themselves shaken energized and more than likely eager to see it again. In the hands of a filmmaker working at the height of her powers interminable boredom and stark terror can be a potent cocktail indeed. The Hurt Locker (130 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for war violence and profanity. >> This StoryRead +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Locker Serves as Iraq Tour De Force Seeing Through Mr. Tough Guy Find Showtimes Tickets Summer Movie Guide Discuss A Wow Performance in Hurt Locker",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/09/AR2009070902327.html,200,thehurtlocker12,thehurtlocker,washingtonpost

""This could be fun.""Are you kidding?In Kathryn Bigelows profoundly tense The Hurt Locker set in Baghdad in 2004 fun is the last thing on the mind of Specialist Owen Eldridge (played by Brian Geraghty). Part of a small Bravo Company team assigned to deal with IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) buried in street rubble or strapped to suicide bombers or concealed in corpses Eldridge is barely hanging on.He wants out of Iraq alive and hes counting down the days.A white-knuckle war movie thats far and away the strongest of the many Operation Iraqi Freedom dramas - more coherent more honed-in than even David Simons Generation Kill series on HBO - The Hurt Locker isnt out to make a political statement.Bigelows movie shot in Jordan by the documentary-trained cinematographer Barry Ackroyd is about survival about the adrenaline rush of risk-taking about the disconnected reality of a combat zone and the addiction of war.Following a devastating opening sequence that underscores both the cruel impartiality of urban warfare and the locked-on-target intensity with which Bigelow plans to tell her tale The Hurt Locker introduces Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner). A chain-smoking cowboy who takes command of the bomb squad - working with the increasingly jittery Eldridge and the steady veteran Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) - James is ready when the call comes in donning the heavy protective suit used to approach suspected IEDs.And then he climbs right out of it again. The suit is cumbersome its oven-hot it cramps his style. He cant get close to the tangle of color-coded wires he needs to unravel the batteries and trigger mechanisms he has to disengage before he and everybody inside the perimeter are blown to smithereens.James a Ranger in from Afghanistan is reckless arrogant. He defies protocol; hes not a team player. Hes going to get Eldridge and Sanborn killed.The Hurt Locker follows James and his uneasy partners as they go from one call to the next to a U.N. compound with a suspicious vehicle parked outside a Baghdad intersection where soldiers have taken cover a desert road where a car carrying British mercenaries has broken down.And everywhere there are Iraqis looking on from minarets and railway tracks standing in storefronts cradling cell phones (a potential trigger device) - kids women old men. Any one of them is a possible sniper a detonator the enemy.Fused with paranoia and almost unbearable suspense The Hurt Locker is powerful stuff. Bigelows close-up filmmaking style is riveting and the performances from Renner Mackie and Geraghty are stripped of artifice. Ralph Fiennes David Morse (as a commanding officer in awe of James) and Guy Pearce are among the supporting players all working from a spare but revealing screenplay by Mark Boal a journalist who was embedded with an Army bomb squad.Five years down the line from when the film takes place with the U.S. military recently pulled out of Iraqs cities the first step in the eventual withdrawal it could be argued that The Hurt Locker is less relevant less illuminating. Thats not the case.Like all the best war movies - no matter what war what era - The Hurt Locker goes to the core of human nature. The violence the bravery the insanity the predatory instincts and instinct for survival - theyre all here all exposed on the blood-soaked blocks of Baghdad.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / July 10 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) dismantles roadside bombs as part of an Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) squad. In addition to being very good at it hes also very taken with the excitement of risk and the pleasure he receives from locating and detonating bombs. In ""The Hurt Locker the thrill is unexpectedly contagious. You dont realize how riveted you are until youre back on American soil observing James in civilian life. He seems discontent in his role as husband father and man of the house like an athlete who misses the game.Screenwriter Mark Boal and director Kathryn Bigelow have made a unique film about war. Other movies have looked and felt the way this one does - hot suspenseful as if something could go wrong at any moment. But ""The Hurt Locker suppresses the politics of war particularly this war where the politics always seem to hover unstable in the ether. It focuses instead on men who exist in combats shadow. The bomb squad arrives on the scene in the grace period before daily calm becomes deadly chaos. Troops hang back. Iraqi civilians hide. The bomb squad waxes poetic.In the opening minutes Sergeant Matt Thompson (Guy Pearce) of Bravo Company leads a conversation about the art of the explosion the way the clouds of smoke and flame fill the sky. In their understanding the plume itself is distinguishable from the violence that produced it. Their rapture is theoretical since not much later a botched dismantling shows us the real thing in all its grisliness and dreadful immediacy. The beauty of the detonation (rocks seem to levitate off the ground) cant compete with the bombs devastation.Just that fast Boal and Bigelow have given us the astronomical stakes for these men and what it means for things to go wrong. Death is always a millimeter away. They keep romance on the one hand and reality on the other. The accident makes room for Sergeant James to join Bravo. His two young comrades Sergeant J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Todd Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) dont know what to do with him. When they meet only 38 days remain in their tour and Jamess unorthodox approach suggests they might not make it to 37.In his first assignment with the solemn Sanborn and the underripe Eldridge he forgoes the robotic drone the squad uses to assist in detonations and gets right up close to a possible improvised explosive device. ""I think I found something he mumbles as much to himself and to the bomb as to Sanborn and Eldridge who provide anxious cover in the dwindling minutes they have until insurgents descend. Hes the Bomb Whisperer.Its recommended that James wear a thickly padded green suit made of among many other things Kevlar and fire-retardant polymers. I looked up such a suit on a website called Security Pro. If you want a sobering read treat yourself to the detailed description of whats in an EOD suit and how much one costs. You dont need any of that information to let out a nervous laugh when James removes his while casing a car for a bomb but it might deepen your appreciation for just how riskily eccentric he can be. ""If Im gonna die he tells Sanborn and Eldridge ""Im gonna die comfortable. James is a complex creation too feeling toward others to be called a renegade not feeling enough to make a full commitment to domesticity. Under his bed he keeps a crate of bomb parts things he says that almost killed him. The movies title comes from the colloquial expression for a place of pain like a war. But that crate is a sort of hurt locker too.Renners performance underscores Jamess contradictions. Its a very smart piece of acting that balances Jamess love of his vocation with his pathologically cavalier approach to it. The actor has the soft face and kind eyes Ive seen in soldiers at the airport awaiting deployment. Of course Ive also seen Renner use that same softness to play Jeffrey Dahmer in 2002s ""Dahmer and what was so creepy about that performance was how utterly natural it was.Renner is so good in ""The Hurt Locker that he makes you wish the other characters were as fully written. Boal who spent a number of months as an embedded reporter in Iraq has written some colorful caricatures for Ralph Fiennes and David Morse to play. But most scenes Renner shares with Mackie and Geraghty are richly acted particularly in a well-drawn sequence during a desert shootout that injects urgency into the strange comedy of things.Another movie might have tried to turn James into a hero. Or maybe weve never seen a William James before because theres nothing innately glorious about his eccentric enthusiasm. Hes on the front line in a way that wouldnt interest macho directors like Tony Scott and his brother Ridley both of whom have made films about either the military or combat. These characters are characters that dont blow things up.Bigelow is no stranger to pyrotechnics or the slick contours of an action sequence. She also made ""Near Dark (1987) ""Blue Steel (1989) and ""Point Break (1991) three completely different kinds of thrillers. But the beauty of her career even in action films that dont entirely work like 1995s ""Strange Days and 2002s ""K-19 The Widowmaker resides in the grace she affords her male characters.In ""The Hurt Locker Bigelow finds unexpected ways to express empathy and sensitivity. Rather than trace the path a bullet takes to its human target she focuses on the dance a casing does after its left a rifle. The movie manages not to glorify war. It even implies that James is addicted to the role he plays in this one. But what were allowed so vividly to see and feel when James disarms a bomb is almost no different from watching a conductor seduce an orchestra or a chef produce a meal. It moves him. Thats a feeling both distinct from war and inextricable from it.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

""I hate violence"" says Patrick Swayzes murdering surfing skydiving bank-robbing shaman in ""Point Break."" Its a punch line--the film is certifiably insane as well as gloriously kinetic--but we can relate. We decry violence yet millions of us pay good money to revel in it vicariously. In her grim thriller ""Strange Days"" far harsher than ""Point Break"" Bigelow asked herself (as she said in one interview) ""why we need to have these vicarious thrills"" this ""adrenalized"" brutality. ""The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction for war is a drug."" This is the opening quotation taken from a book by former war correspondent Chris Hedges in ""The Hurt Locker."" The film is Bigelows latest and in many ways strongest work--vivid assured and extremely suspenseful. Taking moviegoers by the collar and throwing them headlong into one horrifying life-and-death situation after another Bigelow and her collaborators remind us that cinema like war is a drug. Most Iraq-themed films have stuck to the home front. Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal by contrast have made the first fictional feature about American soldiers in Iraq that doesnt fall apart or preach to a choir or turn into a position paper. ""The Hurt Locker"" plays it right down the middle politically staying remarkably free of cant or polemical blather focusing--as any good procedural should--on the incremental details of one persons line of work. Jeremy Renner plays the soldier running toward the explosives while everyone else is ducking and covering. He is Staff Sgt. William James a bomb tech whose job entails disarming one Improvised Explosive Device (IED) after another day after day after day. James leads a small perpetually imperiled group of U.S. Army soldiers in the Explosive Ordnance Disposal squad of Bravo Company.As an embedded journalist writing for Playboy magazine Boal wrote about life and war in Baghdad and with Bigelow (both are credited as producers) he expanded his nonfiction chronicle into a fictionalized screenplay. The film is set in 2004 and is no less a period piece than Oliver Stones Vietnam-era ""Platoon"" or Stanley Kubricks World War I masterpiece ""Paths of Glory."" Like ""Platoon"" Bigelows picture seems to play well with a wide variety of American moviegoers conservatives liberals or centrists. Its political dimension obliquely layered is buried deep along with the explosives. An adrenaline junkie no less strung out than the ""Point Break"" thrill-seekers  James is spectacularly skillful. He has disarmed nearly 1000 IEDs in his tours of duty. With about a month to go on their rotation Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie pictured above right with Renner) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) have no interest in breaking any rules of protocol or taking any undue risks. James their new superior lives for the risk and the thrill of cheating death. The verbal tensions among these men have their cliched moments but they are fleeting. The film doesnt talk much. It shows. The opening sequence reveals precisely what warriors such as James are up against. Shooting in Jordan using multiple 16 mm cameras plus one digital camera Bigelow lays out ""The Hurt Locker"" like a master tactician. First shot The camera snakes along the hot dusty ground. Then from another perspective were told we have just seen images captured by a video camera attached to a robot heading toward a pile of rubble that may contain an IED. Guy Pearce of ""L.A. Confidential"" one of a handful of widely recognizable faces in Bigelows cast (Ralph Fiennes and David Morse are the others) plays the soldier guiding the robot. The robot malfunctions. Like a knight donning his armor Pearces character slips on an 80-pound protective suit which if things dont go well with the IED will not protect him at all. There is a cinematic flourish at the end of this opening scene that I question. Its self-conscious attention-getting flash seems misjudged--""cool"" in the wrong way. Now and then the musical score melodramatizes the tension when no extra drama is needed. But these are small problems. At their best Bigelow and her colleagues make us experience first-hand and with profoundly mixed feelings James heroism as well as his nerve-racking addiction to the scariest job on the planet. The result feels like a documentary that happens to be fictional. Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd who shot ""United 93"" deploys similar hand-held methods here and while Bigelows work is no less stylized than ""Point Break"" or ""Strange Days"" or her first feature an arch homage to ""The Wild One"" called ""The Loveless"" the style suits the material. Its fiercely effective. Time will tell if ""The Hurt Locker"" is a classic but right here right now its a formidable experience.MPAA rating R (for war violence and language)Running time 210. Opens FridayStarring Jeremy Renner (Staff Sgt. James); Anthony Mackie (Sgt. Sanborn); Brian Geraghty (Specialist Eldridge); Ralph Fiennes (Contractor Team Leader); Guy Pearce (Sgt. Thompson); David Morse (Col. Reed) Directed by Kathryn Bigelow; written by Mark Boal; produced by Bigelow Boal Greg Shapiro and Nicolas Chartier. A Summit Entertainment release.

(AP/Summit Entertainment) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 25 2009 308 PM Title The Hurt Locker Its finally here the war movie this era needs. For years directors have been trying to turn our attentions to Iraq and for years few have listened. Unapologetically blunt and undeniably gifted Kathryn Bigelow isnt the kind of filmmaker who expects to go unnoticed. Striding forcefully into their all-male terrain Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal pull us along with them insistent that we see war as soldiers do in all its brutal romantic senseless predictable terrifying and even addictive ways. In one of many smart choices they broaden their scope by narrowing their focus towards three members of an Army bomb squad. The team has just a month left in Baghdad but for men who defuse explosives around the clock a month may as well be a lifetime. Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are on the brink of physical and emotional exhaustion when Staff Sergeant James (Jeremy Renner) arrives to replace the guy who got blown up before him. Sanborn and Eldridge are counting the days until they leave so theyre none too thrilled when James turns out to be a cowboy with an apparent death wish. No bomb is too dangerous to approach no risk too extreme to take. Unafraid to push everybody - including the audience - to the brink Bigelow shows us how young men raised on adrenaline-pumped movies like hers respond when they find themselves in a starring role. To her eyes its inevitable that modern soldiers who spend their days edgily scanning windows and dark alleys relax by playing video games that offer a safer version of the same nerve-wracking rush. The film opens and closes with an unnecessarily heavy hand but everything in between is edge-of-your-seat burrow-into-your-brain stuff. And what youll remember most will be Renners remarkably complex commander. By the time we finally figure him out its become clear weve witnessed a star-making performance in a movie that deserves to stand as one of the defining films of the decade.

"The Hurt Locker - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW The Hurt LockerIn Kathryn Bigelows hands the tale of an Army bomb squad unit deployed in Baghdad becomes a classic study of men in combat and the toll it takes.June 26 2009|Kenneth Turan | Film Critic ""The Hurt Locker"" has the killer impact of the explosive devices that are the heart of its plot It simply blows you apart and doesnt bother putting you back together again. Overwhelmingly tense overflowing with crackling verisimilitude its both the film about the war in Iraq that weve been waiting for and the kind of unqualified triumph thats been long expected from director Kathryn Bigelow.Bigelow has been on critics watch lists since her hallucinatory early films ""The Loveless"" and ""Near Dark."" But until now shes never had a subject that so successfully utilized her gift for stylized suspense and what she calls ""heightened emotional states"" as this tale of a three-man U.S. Army bomb squad (tautly portrayed by Jeremy Renner Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty) deployed in the terrifying streets of Baghdad.Actually its unfair to burden ""The Hurt Locker"" with the Iraq label. Its more of a classic study of men in combat and under stress that could have taken place almost anytime anywhere. Theres no sense of winning or losing a war here no notion of making a difference or achieving lofty geopolitical aims. But by narrowing its focus to the bomb squads specific life or death tasks of defusing roadside IEDs (improvised explosive devices) the film manages to expand its effectiveness as well as its relevance.Though its themes are universal ""Hurt Lockers"" specificity of action and situation are what make it compelling. Bigelow and her team bring an awesome ferocity to re-creating the unhinged mania of bomb removal in an alien culturally unfathomable atmosphere. Here is a world where total jeopardy is the watchword where chaos paranoia and random chance make the rules where the number of ways you could lose your life -- or your mind -- are infinite yet growing.""The Hurt Lockers"" verisimilitude begins with the lean and compelling script by Mark Boal a journalist and screenwriter who wrote the magazine article on which ""In the Valley of Elah"" was based. Boal spent time embedded with an Army bomb squad in Iraq and the resulting script is closely observed and sharp enough to attract in addition to the three stars performers of the caliber of Guy Pearce Ralph Fiennes and David Morse in what are essentially supporting roles.The actors who play the bomb squad trio are admired in the business as consummate professionals Renner for his work in ""Dahmer"" and ""North Country;"" the protean Mackie for ""Half Nelson"" ""Brother to Brother"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" and Geraghty for ""Bobby"" and ""Jarhead."" What they accomplish here will raise their profiles considerably.Helping the actors dig into themselves are aspects of the way ""The Hurt Locker"" was shot by Barry Ackroyd who did similarly impeccable verite work on ""United 93."" First most of the film was photographed in the at times 130 degree heat and dust of Amman Jordan a city with physical similarities to parts of Baghdad. Second Bigelow chose to shoot with four hand-held cameras working simultaneously -- a scenario similar to the one Jonathan Demme used on ""Rachel Getting Married"" -- which gave editors Bob Murawski and Chris Innis a staggering 200 hours of footage to deal with.Director Bigelow brought all these elements together by hewing to that venerable dramatic rubric of revealing character through action. We learn almost all we need to know about these men not through what they say but through what they do in a series of mind-bending situations. What comes to light is not only individual traits but also different attitudes to crises separate but surprisingly equal definitions of what we talk about when were talking about heroism and courage.""The Hurt Locker"" is structured around the 38 days the three men in the EOD (for Explosive Ordnance Disposal) squad have left in their rotation in Iraq. Men like Spc. Owen Eldridge (Geraghty) know all too well that every new day is potentially one they will not survive. They all want to avoid the hurt locker the place where bad things happen.The veteran of the group is Sgt. J.T. Sanborn. As played by the always excellent Mackie hes a soldier who is as sane and level-headed as the situation allows. His job is to keep everybody safe and to communicate with the team leader the guy who puts on the 140-pound protective suit and goes in to defuse the bombs knowing that no suit will protect him once he gets close to the device and enters the kill zone.Though Eldridge and Sanborn have been in the Army and in Iraq for some time theyve never met anyone like their new leader Staff Sgt. William James (Renner). A true fatalist whose first act is to remove the protective plywood around his bunk to let the light in James just wants to get in there and handle it no questions asked.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESOriginal screenplay The Hurt LockerMarch 8 2010Hurt Locker wins for sound mixing and sound editingMarch 8 2010Betsy Sharkey The Hurt LockerFebruary 25 2010Plaudits for Kathryn Bigelow and Hurt LockerDecember 23 2009Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/26/entertainment/et-hurtlocker26,200,thehurtlocker21,thehurtlocker,latimes

Despite its pumped-up admiration for our troops and some scenes that spurt adrenaline like a fire hose this sort-of-thriller about a bomb squad working in 2004 is stretched both timewise and for plausibility. Kathryn Bigelow (""Point Break"") one of Hollywoods few remaining unashamedly manly directors -- its easy to picture her slugging back whiskeys with John Ford or Howard Hawks making jokes about gun-control pansies -- puts you in the boots of a cocky Ranger sergeant (Jeremy Renner in a gung-ho performance) who leads his squadmates (Anthony Mackie Brian Geraghty) in defusing IEDs or improvised explosive devices -- roadside booby traps. James (Renner) clad in a protective outfit as bulky as a spacesuit carefully clips his way through wires as Bigelow stomps on the suspense pedal. In one particularly gulp-inducing shot he pulls one cord only to discover its attached to a spider web of wires each leading to its own bomb. The movie photographed in the shake-the-camera play-with-the-zoom-lens style that used to say ""gritty"" but now says ""Dunder Mifflin"" is more an anthology than a story. After three long tense bomb-defusing scenes that dont vary much (twice a soldier lights a cigarette afterward but the comparison to having sex seems forced -- all hes scored is the right to keep living) Bigelow finds herself starting over with a long sniper sequence that while intensely realized says little. After this the troops horse around get wasted and listen to heavy metal. Its been done. Ralph Fiennes Guy Pearce and David Morse pop up but each of them only for a few minutes as if theyre guests on a lethal version of ""The Tonight Show."" Each is so poorly integrated into the film that its as if the actors happened to be visiting the set when Bigelow ordered them to suit up and they were afraid to say no. In the second half James goes on two hard-to- believe quests first busting into the home of a friendly Iraqi to wave a pistol around then leading a demented freelance mission to find a bomber in the streets at night. Tense? Yes. And filmed with gusto. ""We didnt have to go out looking for trouble to get your adrenaline fix"" says one soldier. True. Thats why enlisted troops take orders from older officers instead of running around organizing suicide missions with no supervision whatsoever. kyle.smithnypost.com THE HURT LOCKER Feel the pain.

Kathryn Bigelows unsettling film is more than explosions and gore Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Kathryn Bigelow Movies Entertainment News Whats most striking about Kathryn Bigelows ""The Hurt Locker"" isnt its action sequences -- which are low-key to begin with -- but its tense quietness This is a war movie that rarely goes ""boom"" a salient choice considering that its central character is an explosives expert. Then again perhaps the true subject of Bigelows movie isnt war but human stress After a particularly tough day the movies three central characters bomb-squad specialists go back to base and commence drinking and roughhousing and wrestling seeing who can take the hardest punch. This is how they shake off the days anxieties pushing themselves past the point of exhaustion and consciousness so they can finally rest. They handle the emotional strain of their work not by breaking down but by getting tougher a strategy that can only carry them so long. Yet ""The Hurt Locker"" isnt about reaching the breaking point. Its about the long slow buildup to that potential breaking point the reality that when youve experienced war firsthand one of the things that comes home with you is the possibility of madness. Maybe thats what makes the movies quietness so unsettling.""The Hurt Locker"" set in 2004 Baghdad follows three members of the Armys Explosive Ordnance Disposal squad men specially trained to dismantle IEDs (improvised explosive devices) through the last 38 days of their tour. Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is a newcomer to the team though hes not new to this line of work. (We later see that he keeps souvenirs of every explosive hes dismantled in a box beneath his bed each one a little piece of some mechanism made by the hands of another human being that could have killed him.) The other two team members Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) still reeling from the loss of their previous team leader (played by Guy Pearce) are having trouble accepting him They see him as a reckless cowboy and theyre not wrong. As James approaches a particularly tricky device he tosses aside his giant protective helmet a bulky thing that bears a resemblance to old-time divers headgear. His partners covering him from a distance watch in disbelief. Sanborn via radio asks him what the hell hes doing. He tells them with James Dean-style insouciance that if hes going to die hes at least going to be comfortable.James approach generally works. His swagger is his armor the thing that gets him through the day -- gets him through most days -- without suffering or causing much harm. And getting inside his head and those of his buddies is what Bigelow is after. Bigelow working from a script by Mark Boal a journalist who spent time embedded with a bomb unit in Iraq works just a small corner of the wartime experience instead of attempting the futile task of making grand statements about the whole and to a point her approach works well. ""The Hurt Locker"" stands as a collection of well-executed set pieces many of them involving James dismantling of various devices Even though hes essentially doing the same thing every time (looking for and following the right wire) Bigelow shoots these sequences in a way that differentiates one event from the next. She captures the extremely mundane nature of the teams job without losing sight of the fact that one sudden ill-chosen movement could kill them.The drawback is that even though ""The Hurt Locker"" is extremely effective in places it ultimately feels unformed and somewhat unfinished. Its to Bigelows credit that she doesnt make any final grand pronouncements but the picture could use more dramatic shaping and Bigelow might have allowed just a few cracks in her cool reserve. Its inevitable that ""The Hurt Locker"" will be compared to Brian De Palmas ""Redacted"" another picture about soldiers experience in Iraq but it doesnt have that movies raw anguish or sense of outrage. Bigelow and her director of photography Barry Ackroyd also make extensive use of hand-held cameras as almost everyone in the film industry does these days. They seem to have bought into the fallacy that a jiggly frame enhances the immediacy of a scene but I wonder if a more classical approach wouldnt have worked better Stillness is far more suspenseful and more unnerving than constant jitteriness. Bigelow also lifts a scene a bit shamelessly from Paul Mazurskys ""Moscow on the Hudson"" in which Russian defector Robin Williams finds himself overwhelmed by choice in an American supermarket; she might have found another way to make her point about the glut of creature comforts American life has to offer. You Might Also Like But Bigelow does have a grasp of technique that many younger mainstream filmmakers havent bothered to learn. Over the years Bigelow has sometimes been guilty of working too hard to out-macho the guys (particularly with movies like ""Blue Steel"") though shes also made a few terrific and distinctive pictures like the raggedly poetic vampire story ""Near Dark."" In ""The Hurt Locker"" she lets the guys do all the swaggering and the approach works. Whats more in any sequence involving gunfire she makes sure you always know where one character is in relationship to another. Its crazy that weve reached the point where we praise filmmakers for honoring the basics of good filmmaking but in an age in which few filmmakers bother to shoot action sequences clearly Bigelow stands out as an exception.And in the end Bigelows point of view is whats most interesting about ""The Hurt Locker."" The pictures strength lies in the details she focuses on. Some of them are small ones -- skinny cats trotting purposefully down dusty Baghdad streets or a herd of goats shambling dangerously near a device thats about to be detonated -- that show the way everyday life goes on even in a war zone. But many of Bigelows choices go even deeper James parched after a long extremely tense stakeout in the sun -- a group of snipers have had him and his team trapped in a single location for hours -- asks Eldridge to locate some juice if he can. When James dazed and stressed out gets the juice pack in hand he fumbles to unwrap the little straw -- even as hes risking his life to do mens work hes suffering the momentary clumsiness of a little kid. And when he finally manages to get the damn thing ready to drink he hands it without touching it himself to Sanborn who hasnt said a word about being thirsty but whos clearly just as dehydrated as James is. Its a way of getting at the essence of leadership without using anything so mundane as language. Similarly ""The Hurt Locker"" conveys the distrust between Iraqis and Americans with gestures and carefully chosen shots instead of words. (The wary friendship James strikes up with a brash Iraqi kid who peddles DVDs on the street has a particularly piercing coda.) Taxicab drivers butchers and housewives may innocently try to go about their daily business but the soldiers cant trust in their innocence. The uneasiness between the invaders and the invaded is an uncomfortable but natural state -- Bigelow and Boal dont try to force any facile political resolutions. Bigelow also coaxes understated performances from her actors Pearce and Ralph Fiennes both give terrific compact performances in very small roles. Renner is sometimes a bit too low-key -- hes going for subtlety and often hes just difficult to read. But he Mackie and Geraghty succeed in mapping the rocky territory of their relationship Mackies Sanborn with his background in intelligence work at first tries to put the ""cracker"" James in his place; the shy shambling Eldridge as hes played by Geraghty is the most openly fearful of the three though he ultimately copes with his anger in a way that might actually be healthy.And while were all supposed to tread carefully around the land mines of gender generalizations theres no escaping the fact that ""The Hurt Locker"" is a war movie made by a woman. Even though women fight wars too -- more so today than ever before -- Bigelow happens to be focusing on three men here and if their sense of honor and duty arent exclusively male traits Bigelow accepts that their machismo plays a role in how they go about their job and in how they survive it. Shes sympathetic toward her characters without coddling them or infantilizing them. Bigelow is an outsider looking in and she knows it but that status also allows her some freedom. The guys in ""The Hurt Locker"" are human beings first and men second. The point maybe is that you dont have to have a dick to understand what theyre going through.

"The Hurt Locker reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Hurt Locker reviewed. The Hurt Locker reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 25 2009 734 PM The Hurt Locker You will never see a better movie about an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team. By Dana Stevens Click here to read more about The Hurt Lockers Kathryn Bigelow and her unique approach to action movies The Hurt Locker In the ""Slate Movie Club"" a couple of years ago I got a chance to air my grievances about the Hollywood war movie. The pretext for the discussion was Clint Eastwoods Flags of Our Fathers but the structural problem we discussed is endemic to the genre War movies tend to begin by introducing a large number of characters (an incoming boot-camp class a unit of soldiers etc.) differentiating them just enough so the audience can tell them apart (the gung-ho warrior the coward the sensitive guy) and then picking them off one by one in a series of gruesome battle scenes until the last man standing our protagonist either dies himself or goes home a changed man. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. This Spam-in-a-can suspense strategy makes for movies that are simultaneously tense (Whos going to get smoked next and how?) and boring (How many more guys have to get smoked before I can go home?). The argument could be made of course that this sickening alternation between boredom and fear is precisely what war really feels like. But like other intense life experiences (having a baby falling in love) combat may need to undergo some kind of cinematic alchemy for its reality to become palpable on-screen. In The Hurt Locker (Summit Entertainment) Kathryn Bigelow accomplishes that alchemy--and she does it not by rejecting the Spam-in-a-can structure but by reducing it to its barest elements. Advertisement The film begins by introducing a very small number of characters--three members of an elite bomb-disposal squad in Iraq--then instantly plunges them into an impossibly tense situation as a robot designed to defuse bombs malfunctions and a soldier Sgt. Matt Thompson (Guy Pearce) is forced to get way too close to a ticking IED. Sgt. Thompson either gets blown to smithereens or doesnt (you think Im going to tell you?) and then this unbearably anxiety-provoking situation repeats itself with slight variations in the type of bomb being approached and the person approaching it over and over again for the next two hours. By keeping its scale miniature instead of epic (there are no combat scenes in the traditional sense) The Hurt Locker keeps its audience in a constant state of tension without risking battle fatigue. But the main advantage The Hurt Locker has over conventional war epics is the richness of its characters. The members of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team arent hastily sketched cannon fodder or iconically heroic bores but damaged blustering certifiably crazy and admirably brave men. Sgt. Thompsons fellow squad members include Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) and eventually Staff Sgt. Will James (Jeremy Renner). On his first day with the unit the hotheaded James immediately alienates the by-the-book Sanborn by disregarding his advice and wading into a harrowing (and entirely avoidable) near-death scenario. For the rest of their tour James drives his squadmates and himself nearly mad with his adrenaline-seeking consequence-ignoring behavior going AWOL to track down a suspected bomber and doffing the safety helmet of his Kevlar suit as he investigates a car trunk full of explosives. (""If Im going to die Ill die comfortable."") But just when you think you know the familiar roles that James and Sanborn occupy--the macho thrill addict the meticulous professional--theyll reverse positions as Sanborn reveals a masochistic appetite for drunken fistfights and James proves unexpectedly tender with the emotionally troubled Eldridge. Theres just more than a month left in the squads rotation as the film begins and the days get counted down on-screen with queasy inexorability 23 days left to go ... 16 ... three. The Hurt Locker was scripted by journalist Mark Boal who wrote an article of the same title about being embedded with a bomb-defusal unit in Iraq.  Theres a journalistic attention to the quotidian details of life on the ground but the films elegant episodic structure and the way it uses action sequences to reveal character are the opposite of documentary-style realism. Bigelow is an elegant even intellectual filmmaker but her style here never feels arty or abstract; whether surveying the Green Zone from above or in tight close-up on a spent shell bouncing on the ground her camera is always right where you want it to be. Jeremy Renner is a discovery of an actor; once youve seen him in a movie you go around asking people ""Do you know this Jeremy Renner guy?"" and usually the answer is no. That happened to me with Dahmer his frighteningly intense (and even more frighteningly sympathetic) 2002 portrayal of cannibalistic serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. After The Hurt Locker (which is without question the most exciting and least ideological movie yet made about the war in Iraq) everyone will remember Renners name.

Granted one wish Merida must rely on her bravery and her archery skills to undo a beastly curse. Video courtesy of Pixar. By Joe Morgenstern Updated June 21 2012 656 p.m. ET For the first time in ""Brave"" Pixar has made an animated feature with a female protagonist--a young Scottish princess Merida with incendiary red hair a sweetly independent swagger a talent for archery and a thirst for adventure. Thats a good first and long overdue but theres another one that isnt good at all. ""Brave"" is the first film under Pixars banner that teaches life lessons through insistent preachments instead of letting dramatic events speak for themselves. The most obvious lesson for Merida is to be careful what you wish for since one of her wishes goes horribly wrong and turns her kingdom upside down forcing her to find the bravery that will put things right. The most important lesson for the audience is to be clear about what you expect. This is less a film in the lustrous Pixar tradition than a Disney fairy tale told with Pixars virtuosity. As such its enjoyable consistently beautiful fairly conventional occasionally surprising and ultimately disappointing. ENLARGE Merida voiced by Kelly Macdonald in Brave. Disney/Pixar The issue of expectations is unavoidable since the films marketing campaign like the early passages of the film itself suggests a feminist fable of a young warrior going off to fight her own battles--thus the iconic poster image of the heroine alone in a forest bow and arrow at the ready. For a while Merida (voiced superbly by Kelly Macdonald) does indeed struggle against constraints that threaten her freedom tight dresses boobish suitors arbitrary dictates of etiquette and worst of all a strict mother who insists that a princess should always strive for perfection. And Merida does make a break for it on an escape route that takes her through spectacular settings--one memorable shot finds her standing tall atop a towering rock pedestal--then plunges her into a shady green glade where blue will o the wisps shimmer seductively. Suddenly however the saga takes a sharp turn into witchery wishes and a magical spell--a notably confusing spell prompted by vague plotting--and ""Brave"" becomes a story not of a rebellious daughter but of the bonds between daughter and mother in magical circumstances. The only thing Ill note of those circumstances is that they lead to encounters of genuine tenderness humor and complexity as well as affecting role-reversals in which the child takes care of the parent. So whats to be said against the familiar theme of a mother and daughter establishing a new relationship on the basis of new understandings? First off the theme is at odds with what precedes it. And the familiarity breeds dismay for the last thing weve come to expect from a Pixar film is tried-and-true family-friendly formulations. (The voice cast includes Emma Thompson Billy Connolly Julie Walters and Robbie Coltrane.) ""Brave"" was a notoriously troubled production with a change of directors that clearly led to a change of narrative direction. (The complexity of the final credits reflects the tortuous history directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman and co-directed by Steve Purcell from a script written by Messrs. Andrews and Purcell Ms. Chapman and Irene Mecchi.) That raises the question of how much this Disney-esque fable was influenced by Disney which used to be Pixars distributor and is now the studios owner. Theres no way to know and its certainly premature to panic about Pixars fate. The studio that has given us such animated masterpieces as the ""Toy Story"" trilogy ""Finding Nemo"" and ""WALLE"" may well have a host of untold wonders in its pipeline. At the same time though there is reason to be concerned--not because of the failings of ""Brave"" which is a pleasant entertainment on its own terms but because of the singular promise that Pixar represents in a dimming firmament of entertainment conglomerates. ENLARGE Benjamin Walker in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. Twentieth Century Fox Abraham Lincoln the 16th President of the United States discovers vampires are planning to take over the United States. He makes it his mission to eliminate them. Video courtesy of Fox. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter If I understand this history lesson correctly and I fear that I do Honest Abe fitted his rail-splitting ax with a silver edge that was better suited to the vanquishing of vampires; the Civil War was fought over bodily fluids (the Confederate Army having been beefed up so to speak by vampires who valued the Souths slaves as a source of blood) and the Norths secret weapon was melted-down silverware. What I dont understand is why this extended piece of idiocy chose to sink its stinky teeth into our 16th president. If an axe-wielding hero was required George Washington would have been the better choice with the Redcoats as bloodsuckers. Preposterous premises have been the basis of deathless classics from ""Metropolis"" to ""Planet of the Apes."" The problem here isnt idiocy per se but idiocy sans levity; someone forgot to tell the filmmakers--the director Timur Bekmambetov and his co-producer Tim Burton--that the movie was supposed to be fun. Or at least smart. At certain points the script seems poised to develop a parallel between vampires and racists--the story is mainly set in the years before the Civil War--but thats pretty much lost in recurrent stampedes of slavering predators. Fleeting rewards turn up from time to time Benjamin Walkers Lincoln learning kung fu or twirling his ax--the handle of which conceals a gun--like a demented drum major; Mary Elizabeth Winsteads Mary Todd standing on top of the stovepipe hat that Abe had dropped in order to kiss him; a computer-generated vista of a foundry melting down the forks that will save the Union. But Anthony Mackie one of Americas finest actors is utterly wasted in the role of Will Johnson Lincolns friend from childhood; theres only so much a star can do with banal material. And much as I tried to keep my sense of humor while watching a movie that has none I lost it during a sequence that cuts between Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg Address and Union troops stabbing the vampires with you know what to win the battle. ENLARGE Judy Davis Woody Allen and Alison Pill in To Rome With Love. Sony Pictures Classics To Rome With Love For better or worse Woody Allen turns out a movie every year. Last years ""Midnight in Paris"" was better than better; that is to say sublime. ""To Rome With Love"" is worse than worse as inert as its predecessor was inspired. How to explain the inexplicable? For all we know the answer could be contractual--an obligation if not to others then to himself to go into production when he didnt have a movie worth doing. Woody Allen directed this film that revolves around Italians expats and the romances adventures and predicaments they get into in the ""Eternal city"". Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. Whats on screen is a collection of cliches intermingled with outlandish farce or surreal fantasy. The cliches starting with the title seem to have been set forth in the hope that we would identify them as cliches but find them fragrant all the same A young American tourist for example finds the Italian man of her dreams at the Trevi fountain. The farce elements excel only in ineptitude. In one Italian newlyweds arrive from the provinces then lose track of each other for an implausible reason with disastrous results. The surrealism is perpetrated mainly by Roberto Benigni insufferably self-enchanted in the role of a Roman nobody who suddenly finds himself a prime celebrity. The fantasy turns on Alec Baldwin as an American architect revisiting a Roman neighborhood where he lived as an ardent young man. Hovering over the action like the stage manager in ""Our Town"" the architect tries to cut through the pretensions of three young lovers but that only makes the prevailing pretentiousness more intense. The cast as almost always in Mr. Allens films is an extraordinary one that includes Penelope Cruz Judy Davis Ellen Page Greta Gerwig Jesse Eisenberg and the filmmaker himself who appears to be playing a bad version of one of the many surrogates who have played him annoyingly. The cinematographer was the excellent Darius Khondji whose work is often distinguished by deep burnished tones. In the spirit of this enterprise the tone is indiscriminately bright. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com ENLARGE Toy Story 2 (1999) Some troubled productions remain so their flaws all too evident in the final product. This one turned out to be a triumph the rare sequel that transcends a great original. Like ""Brave"" the second part of the ""Toy Story"" trilogy suffered from serious script problems. Unlike ""Brave"" the production was shut down the script was junked and Pixars writers got a new script right and then some. The director John Lasseter and his co-directors Ash Brannon and Lee Unkrich worked from a screenplay by Andrew Stanton Rita Hsiao Doug Chamberlin and Chris Webb. The Hurt Locker (2008) Anthony Mackie is Sgt. JT Sanborn one of three members of a bomb squad at the focal point of Kathryn Bigelows Oscar-winning drama which was written by Mark Boal; the others are played by Jeremy Renner and Brian Geraghty. The film manages to be many things at once--a first-rate action thriller a vivid evocation of urban warfare in Iraq and a penetrating study of heroism. Most of all though it is as I wrote when it came out an instant classic that demonstrates how the drug of war hooks its victims and why they cant kick the habit. You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010) Coming after the delightful ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" and before ""Midnight in Paris"" Woody Allens small-scale charmer set in London is a comic roundelay of amorous ambitions and delusions that lead mostly but not entirely to disaster. The cast of characters is small and largely screwy. One couple is played by Anthony Hopkins and the enchanting Gemma Jones; the other by Naomi Watts and Josh Brolin. Its touching to watch everyones struggles and instructive to discover that the screwiest people on screen are the only ones who find true happiness. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

ABOUT THE MOVIE The Hurt Locker    1/2 out of four Stars Anthony Mackie Jeremy Renner Bryan Geraghty Evangeline LillyDirectorKathryn BigelowDistributor Summit EntertainmentRating R for war violence and languageRunning time 2 hours 11 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Finally Hollywood has made a great film about the Iraq War. The Hurt Locker is easily the best of the movies which have focused on the ongoing war. Skillfully directed by Kathryn Bigelow Locker is both a psychological portrait and an exciting action film. It captures the complexities of the war in Iraq with visceral suspense as well as explosive battle sequences and powerful performances. By taking a close look at a trio of courageous but also very human soldiers it brings the conflict to life in a way that no previous movie has managed to do. The story based on the first-hand observations of embedded journalist/screenwriter Mark Boal focuses on technicians in an American bomb disposal squad. We get a palpable sense of the ongoing and extreme peril that is a regular part of their daily lives. These soldiers fend off insurgents and save one another in routine acts of bravery. Not only are they fighting a complicated war; theyre also putting themselves directly in jeopardy at every turn which makes for thrilling viewing. Bigelow explores the effect on the psyche of such imminent danger in both large-scale and intimate ways. Sgt. J.T Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) have been trained to handle homemade bombs and explosive devices. These account for half of American deaths in Iraq and thousands of Iraqi casualties. When cocky Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) joins their team Sanborn and Eldridge take an instant dislike to his cowboy-style arrogance and apparent disregard for safety measures and accepted protocol. But things are not black and white. With their impending departure from Baghdad in just over a month Sanborn and Eldridge try to figure out their new leader and stay alive to make it home. The Hurt Locker wisely probes the distinction between bravery and bravado and is sure to spur discussion on the subject. It is a hauntingly memorable film that is as visually riveting as it is emotionally intense.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 26 2009 Save for later Saved Of the many dramatic movies that have been made about Iraq ""The Hurt Locker"" which is about Army bomb-squad technicians in Baghdad is the only one that conveys with the utmost vividness a documentarylike immediacy. The director Kathryn Bigelow shot with four lightweight cameras and the imagery is rarely still. The jitteriness is appropriate for a world where everything can suddenly blow to smithereens.The script is by Mark Boal whose journalism was the basis for the story behind Paul Haggiss ""In the Valley of Elah"" about a father trying to discover how his soldier son died after returning from Iraq. Boal was embedded in Iraq with an explosive ordnance disposal squad and this helps give ""The Hurt Locker"" set in presurge 2004 its core of verity. The drills the vernacular the missions all seem freshly observed. Bigelows gift for orchestrating violence works especially well in this context because so much of the violence in the movie erupts with such stunning irregularity. She keeps us on edge throughout.Unlike most war movies ""The Hurt Locker"" focuses on just a few soldiers. By-the-book Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are closing out their 38 remaining days in Baghdad as Bravo Company bomb disposal experts when their team is taken over by the cowboyish Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) who is anything but by-the-book. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Blithely waving aside the standard precautionary measures James strides into each bomb site as if he were invincible. Hes reckless and possibly dangerous to his men who at one point contemplate fragging him but even they have to admit hes a whiz at dismantling explosives - 873 to date by his count. (He keeps as souvenirs the cleverest of the insurgents wiring mechanisms.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Hurt Locker Taken purely as a combat movie ""The Hurt Locker"" is impeccably done. Bigelow captures the sudden-death reality of the Baghdad streets (shot in Jordan) as well as anybody ever has. Boals taut script with its pitch-perfect ear for military lingo almost never lapses into Hollywoodese.Renner gives a full-bore performance of great individuality and industriousness but essentially his character is as glamorized as any classic Westerner. (Hes not called a cowboy for nothing.) Hes the guy that like him or not gets the dirty job done. For the most part Sanborn and Eldridge serve as his foils.At its most dramatically complex ""The Hurt Locker"" is about an adrenaline junkie whose double-edged heroism threatens those he has pledged to protect. But Bigelow doesnt push it. James is not a ""dark"" character. There is nothing specific to Iraq about his deathly fixations. We never really hear him (or the other soldiers for that matter) talk politics. What Bigelow is saying is that ultimately all wars regardless of the reasons they are fought boil down to one mantra - survive.James who may have a king-size death wish is constantly testing his invulnerability. He lusts for another go-round in the killing fields. Is Bigelow saying that Iraq created a man like James who cant abide the normalcy of noncombat life? If so she hasnt give us enough of him to judge. For all we can tell James was recklessly gung-ho long before he encased himself in body armor. The sanctification of macho in ""The Hurt Locker"" is a bit much. It takes pot shots for example at the company psychiatrist (Christian Camargo) who counsels the men without having the guts to join them in the field. Although James at one point says that ""everybodys a coward about something"" the only thing he seems afraid of is settling down with his wife and kid. (A standard Westerner trope.) In one of the films rare hackneyed moments he calls them from Baghdad but hangs up rather than speak to them.By placing such a premium on docu-realism Bigelow limits herself. If the convolutions of Jamess character had truly been measured she would have had to radically alter her in-your-face stylistics and risk the land mines of in-depth psychological dramaturgy. But then she might have made a great film instead of a really good one. Grade A- (Rated R for war violence and language.)

Jonathan Olley/Summit Entertainment The Fresh Air Interview Hurt Locker Creators On Explosive New Thriller June 24 2009 When it comes to getting an audiences attention theres nothing quite like blowing up a major star within the first five minutes of a movie. Ill let you discover his identity for yourself. Suffice it to say that the character seems to be taking plenty of precautions first using a radio-controlled robot to explode a bomb half a block away -- then when the robot gets stuck donning a bulky protective suit and helmet that make him look like a deep sea diver. All as it happens for naught. Now this is a guy whos cautious -- so it spooks the squad when his replacement arrives and appears far more cavalier. (And after that opening it should spook audiences as well.) Staff Sgt. Will James (Jeremy Renner) may actually be a careful -- even a talented -- technician but he comes off as a showboating cowboy as likely as not to shuck his protective gear when he approaches a bomb. ""If Im gonna die"" he tells the men as he strips off the deep-sea-diver outfit ""Im gonna die comfortable."" The adrenaline rush of war has been largely missing from Hollywoods Iraq but its certainly front and center in The Hurt Locker the first war movie in a while that feels as if it could have starred John Wayne. Journalist turned screenwriter Mark Boal (In the Valley of Elah) was embedded with a bomb squad while covering American troops in Iraq several years ago an experience that led him to write a film script that follows a bomb squad at closer range than some moviegoers will find entirely comfortable. The film details the unnervingly tense business of defusing (or sometimes safely detonating) roadside munitions reserving moments here and there for the comparative downtime of deadly firefights and guarded fretful camaraderie. That said the adrenaline quotient is supplied only partly by the script. Director Kathryn Bigelow ratchets up tension with scene after wrenching scene -- soaring above the action when Renner tugs at a loose wire that leads to a spidery web of bombs hidden under a road pulling in desperately close to a terrified Iraqi whos been locked and locked and locked again into a bomb harness. That a woman has finally entered the all-male world of war movies -- as director yet -- feels somehow right at this moment. American servicewomen after all are finding themselves in combat situations in this war without a front line in ways they never did in previous wars. If the film were just a series of explosions artfully shot Bigelow might lay claim to making a ferociously effective war flick but she and Boal are aiming a little higher They want to get inside the heads of the men in the squad. Thats a trickier proposition and when the film gets misty about subsidiary characters it also gets a bit lost. More often though its psychologically astute especially when demonstrating how friction between the new guy and the squad smoothes a bit when they discover hes got a sentimental side -- a keepsake box under his bed filled with bomb parts that almost killed him. Also a wedding ring. ""Like I said"" he smiles ""things that almost killed me."" There are things The Hurt Locker does not do. The Iraqis mostly are just scowling faces and the reasons for the American presence in their country are left to other movies. The focus here is on that single bomb squad. And if the quote that first lights up the screen -- ""war is a drug"" -- has been amply illustrated by films end what Bigelow makes even more explosively clear is that for these men war is also centrally a job. A job they have to be really good at or they wont do it for long.

""The Hurt Locker"" Review -- Hollywood for all its liberal talk continues to be an all-boys club. Yet Kathryn Bigelow hasnt only made a place for herself there shed done it by blithely avoiding the femme-film ghetto of indie tragedies and making terrific testosterone-pumped action pictures that have impressed even the toughest fans. After all what fanboy director wouldnt give up a few of his mint-edition comic books to be able to brag that he made the cult hits ""Point Break"" and ""Near Dark""? Even Bigelows misses - the apocalyptic ""End of Days"" the Harrison-Ford-as-a-Russian ""K-19 The Widowmaker"" - had interesting things to say about risk and reward duty and loyalty. The Hurt Locker (R) Summit (131 min.) Directed by Kathryn Bigelow. With Jeremy Renner Brian Geraghty Anthony Mackie. Now playing in New York. STEPHEN WHITTYS REVIEW THREE AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains gory violence and strong language. Bigelows newest film ""The Hurt Locker"" is her smartest and most suspenseful yet. Its set in Iraq but its not really a film about the Iraq war - something that should be said early since thats one genre no ones embraced lately. Instead ""The Hurt Locker"" is about men under pressure forced to rely on one another and how that changes when a new boss who loves the rush of risk enters the picture. These men are soldiers - bomb disposal experts in fact - but they could be cops or fireman (or the cavalrymen in John Fords classic ""Fort Apache""). It doesnt matter. What does matter is that their new boss is an adrenaline junkie who never feels more alive than in those moments when hes close to death. And the closer he walks to it the closer he drags all of them to it too risking their lives along with his. Bigelow has always had an eye for good compositions and big moments but her approach here is grimier grittier handheld and painfully realistic. There are none of those movie moments built around countdown clocks or red-wire/green-wire dilemmas; its all sweat and shouting and men working quickly while other men watch frozen in the shadows. Bigelows three main characters are quickly drawn but the skill of her actors makes them archetypes rather than cliches. Brian Geraghty is the young soldier barely holding it together; Anthony Mackie is the by-the-book sergeant who just wants everybody to make it home alive. And in a star-making performance Jeremy Renner is Staff Sgt. James the cocky bomb expert who puts everyones life on the line. Its an interesting point and its at the heart of the film Is fear sometimes just another word for ""survival instinct""? Is courage just one more side-effect of having a death wish? Bigelows movie (based on a script by journalist Mark Boal who was embedded with a bomb unit in Iraq) suggests that the motivations are just as tangled as the wires these men need to cut through. And just as dangerous. ""The Hurt Locker"" has a few rough edges and one character - an intrusive counselor - who doesnt quite play. But otherwise it offers a fresh take on the war and the men in it. And while it announces a strong new presence in Renner (whod previously passed through ""28 Weeks Later"" and ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" before landing TVs ""The Unusuals"") it also confirms an old one. Kathryn Bigelow can beat the boys at their own game -- mostly because she insists on playing it by her rules. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Over the course of the Iraq War reports of people killed and maimed by the crude roadside bombs known as IED (Improvised Explosive Devices) became commonplace. And yet the people who save lives by defusing such bombs remained largely untrumpeted. Kathryn Bigelows nerve-jangling thriller The Hurt Locker seeks to redress the balance but it wouldnt be accurate to describe the film as merely a paean to American courage and derring-do. Granted the members of the Army bomb squad are a courageous lot and Bigelow and journalist screenwriter Mark Boal (who was embedded with a unit in 2004) treat them with proper reverence. Yet theres a kind of madness that comes with the job where the hair-raising red-wire/blue-wire stresses of day-to-day life can make some soldiers punch-drunk on adrenaline. With his brash devil-may-care cockiness and good-ol-boy swagger Jeremy Renner recalls Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now. Both men have seen and survived so much that they project a dangerous aura of invincibility. Called in to take over for the fallen leader of a three-person bomb squad Renner is precisely the wrong replacement With the other two men Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty still reeling over their loss Renner drags them ever more recklessly into sticky situations on the streets of Baghdad. Though Renners skills are as undeniable as his extraordinary resolve Mackie in particular takes exception to his eccentric tactics and abandonment of protocol. At the same time Mackie recognizes that they both have a job to do. For the first hour or more The Hurt Locker boldly forsakes any conventional narrative hook beyond the ongoing tensions between these men and the terrifying grind of defusing bombs day after day. Since the infamous bar sequence in 1987s Near Dark Bigelow has always thrived on graphic intensity and in the early going especially she suggests the psychological toll on Renner Mackie and Geraghty one aggravating mission at a time. Its a shame she and Boal felt the need to introduce a conventional borderline-sentimental subplot to underline Renners heroism but even then hes a complicated figure and ""heroic"" is only one of many not-all-flattering words that might describe him. Hes a creature of war forever doomed to its unnatural habitat.

Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) debates shooting his Commanding Officer William James (Jeremy Renner) for being too committed to defusing explosives. Sanborn and specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) have just lost one C.O. (Guy Pearce) to a hidden bomb. Now with only a month before their safe stateside return their new leader seems determined to lead them all on suicide missions. Their mornings begin with a countdown of how many days they have left and the introduction of their next challenge--bombs strapped to a man bombs hidden in a car bombs hidden under dirt bombs hidden in a corpse--all of which James insists on dismantling without body protection and without letting his team get a comfortable distance away. (""If Im going to die I want to die comfortable"" he grunts.) Bigelow can sure shoot a crackerjack scene that makes you ball up your fists and suck in your breath and screenwriter Mark Boal (who helped create one of the Gulfs other solid scripts In the Valley of Elah) knows our American love for mavericks is bound to get tied in knots watching James cavalier approach to everyones death. Hes a hero and a menace. In an early nailbiter James insists on defusing a car bomb theyre content to explode; he swaggers back to the car and gets a punch in the face. Theres racial tension between Sanborn and James and for that matter between everyone in the U.S. military and every citizen of Iraq both of which Bigelow deals with flatly as facts of cultural barriers and suspicion. Like many modern Iraq war films The Hurt Locker captures the suffocating paranoia of a civilian enemy. It also captures the tedium. The films best shootout sequence ends with the team staring for hours at a distant desert hideout too afraid there might be one last living sniper to kneel down and grab a juice from their backpack. Whenever the squad is off duty the flick collapses into cliche particularly due to the timorous and unstable Eldridge whose every line feels ripped from a simpler flatter propaganda piece. Bigelow ends with a flashback or flash-forward where we visit James back in the states and see the man who wades into the danger of the desert as casually as a cruise ship swimming pool stand bewildered in a cereal aisle. And suddenly in what looks like weakness we get his bravado. This ""a-ha"" moment feels so good we half wish itd come early enough to watch his character through this new lens.

"Hurt Locker The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hurt-locker-the ) Hurt Locker The (United States 2008) June 24 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli War is hell. Its a clichA(c) but not one that Hollywood often embraces. There are exceptions of course like Oliver Stones Platoon which takes no prisoners in depicting war as the gruesome dehumanizing business it is. But Platoon and other films cut from the same cloth are more dramas than thrillers. The question is whether its possible to generate white-knuckle grip-the-edge-of-the-seat tension in a war movie without turning it into a glorification of violence and bloodshed. Director Kathryn Bigelow James Camerons ex and the filmmaker behind Point Break and Strange Days answers this question with a definitive uncompromising ""yes"" On a weekend when the effects-choked Transformers Revenge of the Fallen staggers into theaters like a stoned 800-pound gorilla and threatens to put audiences to sleep with its brand of deadly dull ""action"" The Hurt Locker is the film to see for those seeking an elevated pulse. Its 20 minutes shorter and about three times more exciting. The Hurt Locker may be the first movie set against the backdrop of the Iraq War with absolutely no political agenda. The film doesnt care if the invasion and occupation are right or wrong or moral or immoral. All that matters is that the troops are there they have a job to do and the most important thing for every man is to get to the end of his tour of duty alive and relatively intact. This is an action movie pure and simple. The Americans and their allies are the ""good guys"" (relatively speaking that is) and the insurgents are the ""bad guys."" It doesnt get any deeper than that. The result is a riveting adrenaline-pumping experience that boasts a number of unforgettable suspense sequences. The characters at the focus of this film are bomb technicians and trying to defuse a bomb while being pinned down by sniper fire is about as nerve-wracking a job as one can have in the military. The Hurt Locker boasts names like Ralph Fiennes Guy Pearce and David Morse in its cast but those well-known actors have only small roles. Thats intentional since although familiar faces get people into theaters they can detract from the reality of the situation. The real stars are Jeremy Renner (as James) Anthony Mackie (as Sanborn) and Brian Geraghty (as Owen Eldridge). They play three members of a bomb disposal unit working in Baghdad. Sanborn and Owen provide backup and cover; James is the man who works on the explosive. Hes a risk-taker which irritates Sanborn and he nearly gets himself blown up on more than one occasion because he takes unnecessary chances. This is a tense well-crafted motion picture that keeps viewers on edge. Its an exhausting 130 minutes; many viewers will leave the theater feeling drained. As it proves during its opening sequence The Hurt Locker isnt beyond dispatching characters unexpectedly and without fanfare. There are at least seven high-octane sequences any of which could form the backbone of a tightly plotted feature. Bigelow rolls from one to the next with only brief pauses. Still despite the focus on suspense and tension the characters are all well realized and the setting is forcefully developed. More than any recent movie this has a ""you are there"" feel to it that gives us a flavor of an Iraq we dont see on the nightly newscasts. (Filming took place in Jordan.) To these men tactical objectives are irrelevant. Its all about counting down the days until the tour of duty is over. The insurgents are one enemy; with them its kill or be killed. The other enemy is the explosive devices and they are even less forgiving. In a way this movie reminded me of the old British TV mini-series Danger UXB in the way it depicts the struggle between man and bomb. One wrong move and theres no chance to try again. The movie was picked up at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival by Summit Entertainment for United States distribution and it has taken nine months for it to finally reach theaters. Theres no questioning its worth the wait.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 09 2009 517PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Hurt Locker Directed by Kathryn Bigelow Written by Mark Boal Starring Jeremy Renner Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty Classification 14A Kathryn Bigelows The Hurt Locker is the only significant feature film to come out of the current Iraq War and part of its power is its uncertainty; it does not have in any conventional sense a message to deliver. This is in sharp contrast with the parade of dully sanctimonious allegories about conflicted loyalties that we have seen so far in such films as Stop-Loss  In the Valley of Elah and The Lucky Ones . The Hurt Locker (bomb-squad slang for where you go when a mistake is made) is a triumph of experiential cinema filled with a rigorous moment-by-moment visceral tension. Is this what fighting in Iraq is like? Anyone who hasnt been in a war is only guessing but there is something powerfully convincing about Bigelows way of placing the viewer in a situation where death is unpredictable can come from 360 degrees and is indiscriminate about who it takes. The movie opens with a quote from former New York Times correspondent Chris Hedges (author of War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning ) to the effect that war is a form of addiction a claim both commonplace and debatable. At least it signals the films serious intent at a time when audiences have been lulled into the idea that action movies and stupidity are synonymous. One would have to go back to The Wages of Fear  Henri-Georges Clouzots 1953 film about hired European workers moving nitroglycerin over mountain dirt roads to match The Hurt Locker s mix of intelligent character observation and white-knuckle tension. The movie consists of seven action set-pieces with connecting dramatic material that establishes the characters and relationships between a three-man army bomb squad in the last month of a one-year rotation in Baghdad. The squad consists of an intelligence officer who gives directions a specialist with a rifle who watches out for attackers and an expert who either guides a robot or defuses or detonates the bombs. The scenarios are based on the experiences of journalist Mark Boal who wrote the script after travelling with an anti-bomb squad. The bombs look and sound authentic; they explode not as Hollywood gasoline bursts but as devices designed to fragment and cause maximum human damage. In the opening scene the soldiers of Bravo Companys Explosive Ordnance Disposal team are called to a busy marketplace to defuse a suspected IED (improvised explosive device). When their robot loses a wheel the teams leader (Guy Pearce) dons his protective suit and goes out to set the charge to detonate the bomb. Hes the first visitor to The Hurt Locker and a warning to viewers Dont count on the films few famous faces staying around for long. March forward to the arrival of the leaders replacement a pudgy-faced good ol boy Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner ) with an apparent reckless streak. Somewhere back home there is a wife and a son but they barely interest him. At first James seems like a stock type an adrenalin junkie with a hero complex. As the movie unfolds we see hes less like a cowboy than an elite surgeon engaging in a series of procedures where his own life is at stake. Instead each bomb presents an opportunity for performance art carefully scrutinized by foes and friends alike peering from behind walls and nearby balconies possibly with their fingers on a detonating button. Precision determines everything. Even a desert shoot-out - using a telescope to direct shells at a point a couple of kilometres away - is a painstaking effort requiring steady hands and careful breath control to get the shell on target before the enemy can shoot first. At times The Hurt Locker can feel a little like standing inside the emergency-room doors watching one atrocity after another come riding in on a gurney. But theres also downtime including some relatively conventional interconnecting dramatic sequences. The three men have carefully contrasting temperaments Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) is a by-the-book professional who is less committed to the mission than committed to getting out alive; specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) is already a psychological mess haunted by the unpredictable instantaneous death that hes sure awaits him. There are somewhat familiar scenes of bravado and dominance - including a drunken fist fight in which Sanborn and James work out their tensions by swigging whisky and punching each other in the stomachs to prove their toughness. Theres a subplot about Sgt. James bonding with an Iraqi boy who goes by the name of Beckham a DVD dealer who speaks in a mishmash of American slang. That friendship leads to a scene outside the wire that suggests James himself is a ticking bomb a demonstration of Hunter S. Thompsons observation that when the going gets weird the weird turn pro. Actor Jeremy Renner who has had only minor movie roles ( North Country  The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford ) emerges here as a compelling tightly coiled actor someone maintaining a precarious balance between the seething pressures from within and the terrors around him. Much of the credit for his performance must go to Bigelow who finally lives up to what has often seemed be an overhyped reputation. After the promise of her early vampire movie Near Dark (1987) and the Keanu Reeves surfer-heist film Point Break (1991) her work has been mediocre to disappointing hitting a nadir with her last feature the 2002 studio action film K-19 The Widowmaker . Theres something about this story and this war that brings out the stripped-down conceptual artist in her Against blank canvases of desert sand and rubble explosive wires are linked to nerve ends and everything that matters depends on the twitch of a muscle or a finger on a button.

It gets inside you like a virus puts your nerves in a blender and twists your guts into a Gordian knot. Set during the last month in the year-long rotation of a three-man U.S. Army bomb squad stationed in Baghdad it may be the only film made about Iraq--documentary or fiction--that gives us a true sense of what it feels like to be on the front lines of a war fought not in jungles but in cities where bombs rise up from the ground instead of raining down from the sky every narrow alley portends an ambush and every onlooker is a potential insurgent. Its an experiential war movie--one that calls to mind the title of the 1950s docudrama series You Are There--but also a psychologically astute one matching its intricate sensory architecture with an equally detailed map of the modern soldiers psyche a diagram of what motivates the volunteers in a volunteer army.The movie begins with a typically bracing set piece in which the soldiers of Bravo Companys Explosive Ordnance Disposal team come upon an IED planted in the center of a busy Baghdad marketplace. When their remote-controlled bomb-detonating robot hits a snag the teams affable leader (Guy Pearce) dons a thick Kevlar suit and attempts to set the charge manually. He does not return. His replacement Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) is a career soldier of an entirely different breed one who prefers to handle bombs up close and personally instead of by remote control and whose Kevlar suit is part of his daily wardrobe--not just for special occasions. At first glance Sgt. James seems like the closest thing to a stock character--the gonzo alpha male living out his childhood cowboy fantasies--in a picture markedly devoid of small-town rubes poetry-quoting intellectuals or any other easily reducible war-movie ""types."" But like most things in The Hurt Locker there is considerably more to him than meets the eye. Beneath his blustery macho surface he may be the movies most intricately wired explosive device.Written by former Voice columnist Mark Boal The Hurt Locker belongs to that subset of Bigelows work--including her biker-gang debut The Loveless and the bank-robbing-surfers caper Point Break--devoted to the ethos of hyper-masculine communities the men who choose to live in them and those who emerge as their leaders. Sgt. James is one such character and Bigelow Boal and especially Renner excel at showing us how his reckless displays of bravado are both a coping mechanism and an addiction a battlefield genius and a form of madness. A secular god with sports hero stats (873 disarmed bombs and counting) he inspires envy in some contempt in others and both in the men under his command--two comparatively by-the-book sergeants (very well played by Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty) who also want to prove their mettle as men of war as long as they go home in one piece. But for James who has an ex-wife and child waiting for him somewhere the adrenaline-rush alterna-reality of Iraq is vastly preferable to the home front with its prison of domestic responsibility. Like the jacked-in wire trippers of Bigelows futuristic Strange Days he yearns for something more visceral more cinematic than everyday life.With her strength of revealing character through action Bigelow comes closer to the tradition of Anthony Mann Sam Fuller and other bygone practitioners of the classic Hollywood war movie than to todays dominant breed of studio A-listers who create (mostly incoherent) action at the expense of character. Not that The Hurt Locker which I take to be the best American film since Paul Thomas Andersons There Will Be Blood much resembles any war movie weve ever seen before. Here combat is more often a solitary rather than a group endeavor--a lone man tracing a rats nest of wires back to its source or exchanging long-distance fire with a single sniper across a vast desert expanse.There is little if any talk about patriotism or homeland security and there are fewer American flags on display than in any American war movie in memory. When The Hurt Locker premiered last fall at the Venice and Toronto film festivals this prompted some observers to tag it as an ""apolitical"" war picture which is really a way of saying that Bigelows film is mercifully free of ham-fisted polemics. Instead of setting out to prove a point it seeks to immerse us in an environment--something Bigelow does with a conceptual rigor usually associated with those directors whose work is confined to film societies and art houses.Time is Bigelows organizing principle here--the time left in Iraq for the men of Bravo company (displayed on the screen as chapter headings throughout) the time that ticks away between the discovery of a bomb and its eventual disarming or detonation and the time that in those unbearably tense moments seems to stretch out indefinitely toward the horizon. War may be hell but in The Hurt Locker its also an incredibly pellucid waking dream.

Movie Quiz Pittsburgher movie quiz for yunz Is Birdman star Michael Keaton the best actor with western Pennsylvania ties? Click here to play the Tribs tongue-in-cheek attempt to find out. Rated R for war violence and language; 3.5 stars Despite their admirable intentions and acclaimed names on both sides of the camera the vast majority of movies made about the Iraq war have failed to hit the mark. Either they felt too preachy or they were rather standard action pictures. ""The Hurt Locker"" is by far the most effective film yet on this subject -- and whats ironic about that is it doesnt even feel all that specific to the Iraq war. Its insights and reach extend far beyond whats happened there over the past several years. Its about an elite U.S. Army bomb squad whose members have 38 days left before they can leave Baghdad in the summer of 2004. Theyre under enormous pressure to avoid mistakes because one false move can mean not only their deaths but the deaths of untold numbers of people around them. But theyre also under internal pressure to get the job done and get back home. Into this intense situation comes the swaggering Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner who earned a Spirit Award for the performance earlier this year). The other members of his team (Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty) dont quite know what to make of him; James might be a genius at his job or he might be an egomaniacal show-off. Maybe hes a little bit of both. The script from journalist Mark Boal who spent time embedded with this kind of bomb squad presents him as a fascinating but always believable jumble of contradictions. So at its core ""The Hurt Locker"" is a character study but through the eyes of veteran action director Kathryn Bigelow (""Point Break"" ""K-19 The Widowmaker"") it also offers an intimate look at gritty visceral combat.

By David Denby Jeremy Renner in Kathryn Bigelows movie about a bomb-disposal squad in Iraq.   Credit Illustration by Frank Stockton The Iraq war has been dramatized on film many times and those films have been ignored just as many times by theatre audiences. But Kathryn Bigelows ""The Hurt Locker"" is the most skillful and emotionally involving picture yet made about the conflict. The film from a script by Mark Boal has a new subject the heroism of the men who defuse improvised explosive devices sloppily made but lethal bombs planted under a bag or a pile of garbage or just beneath the dirt of a Baghdad street. Bigelow stages one prolonged and sinister shoot-out in the desert but the movie couldnt be called a combat film nor is it political except by implication--a mutual distrust between American occupiers and Iraqi citizens is there in every scene. The specialized nature of the subject is part of what makes it so powerful and perhaps American audiences worn out by the mixed emotions of frustration and repugnance inspired by the war can enjoy this film without ambivalence or guilt. ""The Hurt Locker"" narrows the war to the existential confrontation of man and deadly threat. Over and over Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) following a tip-off walks to a bomb site in a heavy protective suit and tries to figure out how to pull apart clumsily tangled wires and flimsy triggering devices. Weve seen Jamess predecessor die on the job a man watching him from a nearby store detonated a bomb with a cell phone. As James goes in slowly under a hot sun treading like a spaceman through trash-filled streets people gather in doorways or look out windows. Which of them is hostile which friendly which merely curious? The two other members of Jamess team the frightened young Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) and the wary experienced Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) cover James screaming at anyone who moves. The two men feel entirely vulnerable; they both admire and detest James who pulls them into situations they would rather leave to someone else. In the past Kathryn Bigelow now fifty-seven has outdone the macho movie boys at their own game. In her ""Blue Steel"" (1989) as Jamie Lee Curtis playing a cop geared up for a days work Bigelow focussed on her revolver her leather holster and her shoes in gleaming closeup. The sequence hovered somewhere between fetish and parody. Bigelow went into the ocean with Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves in the surfer-crime movie ""Point Break"" (1991) and brought off scenes of languorously slo-mo destruction in the cultish sci-fi crime movie ""Strange Days"" (1995). By the mid-nineties I had her figured as a violence junkie with a strong tendency to stylize everything into stunning images that didnt always mean much. As a filmmaker Bigelow is still obsessed with violence but shes become a master at staging it. In ""The Hurt Locker"" there are no wasted shots or merely beautiful images. As Eldridge and Sanborn jerk their guns this way and that at a bomb scene Bigelow working with the great cinematographer Barry Ackroyd jerks the camera around too. She wants us to be there to feel the danger the mystery. This kind of immediacy is commonplace in action filmmaking but unlike so many directors today who jam together crashes explosions and people sailing through the air in nonsensical montages of fantasy movement Bigelow keeps the space tight and coherent. No matter how many times she cuts away you know exactly where James is in relation to a bomb--whether hes in the kill zone or far enough away to be safe. (You cant break up the integrity of space when space is the subject of your movie.) And Bigelow prolongs the moment stretching out our anxiety almost to the point at which it becomes pain. ""The Hurt Locker"" is quite a feat in this period of antic fragmentation Bigelow has restored the wholeness of time and space as essentials for action. Occasionally a plaintive reader writes me a note after Ive panned some violent fantasy movie and says something like ""Some of us like explosions. Ease up."" Well I like these explosions because I believe in them. Realism has its thrills too. The insistence on plainness the absence of stylization carries over to the performances as well. Jeremy Renner has played the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer and many minor roles in action movies. He has a round face with a beautiful smile that he mostly keeps hidden and a strong but unglamorous body. Bigelows idea in casting him I think was to make her star a competent but physically ordinary American serviceman whose greatest gifts are within. William James it turns out is implacably heroic. He never steps away from danger. You might say that hes drawn to it and needs it but he never makes a fuss about what hes doing. His charisma consists of having no obvious charisma except phenomenal concentration and guts. And since he knows handling bombs when to be cautious and when not to be he can be hair-raisingly casual tossing aside a disabled device as if it were an empty juice carton. At one point he shucks his headset too and Sanborn who needs to stay in touch with what James is doing is so enraged that he slugs him. In the nineteen-fifties Aldo Ray played men like William James--war lovers completely at home on the battlefield but hapless in the normal relations of life. (When James and his partners relax and get drunk the only way they can show their affection is to punch one another in the stomach.) But Rays military men were unreachable stone-cold killers while James has strong emotions which he keeps pent up. Bigelow and Mark Boal (the journalist who developed the real-life material that served as the basis of Paul Haggiss ""In the Valley of Elah"") dont always let us know exactly whats going on. As the soldiers swing into action the filmmakers want a sense of strangeness and disorientation a craziness thats on the verge of taking over the moment. As James is walking toward a bomb an Iraqi drives into the scene in a taxi and wont obey commands to go back. What is he up to? Another man strapped with explosives changes his mind about suicide and tearfully begs James to rescue him. Is he a lure? The anguish of uncertainty is part of the mens daily life and James himself so sure in his odd profession gets into a serious mixup over a friendly Iraqi boy who he thinks has been murdered by insurgents. Suddenly he loses his bearings and charges around Baghdad like a madman. ""The Hurt Locker"" is a small classic of tension bravery and fear which will be studied twenty years from now when people want to understand something of what happened to American soldiers in Iraq. If there are moviegoers who are exhausted by the current fashion for relentless fantasy violence this is the convincingly blunt and forceful movie for them. Those of us who avoid junk food with many sighs of relief and self-approval may still be eating junk a good deal of the time. This enraging fact which will not surprise anyone who has read such muckraking books as Eric Schlossers ""Fast Food Nation"" (2001) and Michael Pollans ""The Omnivores Dilemma"" (2006) is one of the discomforting meanings of the powerful new documentary ""Food Inc."" an angry blast of disgust aimed at the American food industry. The introduction of corn as a cheap (heavily subsidized) universal feed for chickens for cows even for fish not to mention the corn products seeping into candy soft drinks cheese and everything else but (if were lucky) capers and olives has in the past thirty years or so made that particular package of starch nearly inescapable. Unless we search out at considerable expense organic free-range poultry and grass-fed meat were eating corn when we eat a chicken or a steak dinner. Were eating corn when we drink a Coke. The seemingly vast array of foods in a typical supermarket is not so varied as we might think; much of it is produced or controlled by a few enormous food companies that have operated without serious government regulation in recent years. We didnt always eat as badly as we do now. The director of ""Food Inc."" Robert Kenner has many outrageous things to tell us about industrial food but the picture is perhaps most upsetting when we get a glimpse (largely from footage shot surreptitiously by workers) of the way poultry and livestock are raised. Chickens are mainly kept in long dark stifling sheds where they stand in their own waste and are fatted with corn to the slaughter point in a mere forty-nine days. Beef cattle are jammed together in enormous pens many of them sick from feed that violates a digestive system built for grass. Their illness can become our illness. Both Schlosser and Pollan--measured factual and devastating--appear in the film laying out the broad outlines of the food system and we see some of its victims most memorably a poor Latino family that admits with resigned sorrow that it can afford to fill up on fast-food burgers but not on fresh vegetables. For many of this movies likely viewers the sting built into ""Food Inc."" is the realization that without unending effort they are not all that much freer in their choices than that hard-pressed family.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Explosive Material Visceral and addictive The Hurt Locker is one hell of a war film. Plus Agnes Vardas enchanting memoir. _ By David Edelstein Published Jun 22 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Summit Entertainment) Among director Kathryn Bigelows many gifts is the ability to make men feel penis envy. Thats the theme (and sly joke) of her melodrama Blue Steel in which a male bystander watches a female cop blast a robber into oblivion and covets her phallic power. Pity the movie is so ham-handed and that Bigelows rollicking existential surfer thriller Point Break ends up drowning in grandiose machismo. But in her smashing Baghdad drama The Hurt Locker Bigelow makes the Olympian leap into the mindand circulatory systemof the male warrior. Her voice is attuned to men under threat from all angles; and the men their weapons cocked are attuned to everythinga squeak a pop a wire snaking out from under a mound of debris. The Hurt Locker might be the first Iraq-set film to break through to a mass audience because it doesnt lead with the paralysis of the guilt-ridden Yank. The horror is there but under the rush. One of Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boals few missteps comes right at the start an onscreen quote from journalist Chris Hedges to the effect that war is a drug a potent and often lethal addiction. The quote is brilliant subversive to the pointand pins down the thesis too much. It robs us of the chance to frame that idea for ourselves. The Hurt Locker is otherwise unhinged. The film revolves around the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit a bomb squad that shows up to dismantle devices of varying degrees of sophistication and deadliness. After an overture in which a cautious sergeant goes bye-bye his replacement shows up Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) a Zen cowboy who strides up to potential IEDs in a way that makes you yelp either What a suicidal motherf-----  or That is some hot shit A colonel (David Morse) repeats the latter like a hosanna but Sergeant J. T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) working under James thinks hes dangerousa cock-of-the-walk on a walk off a cliff. BACKSTORY The Hurt Locker star Jeremy Renner says the title of film took on different meanings over the course of the shoot. At first it represented the threat of death and he thought of it as a casket. Later on he says it became a physical place because we had one outhouse for 250 people and we were all getting sick Id say I have to go to the hurt locker.  Finally it became this spiritual place of anguish he says. It was 125 degrees the bomb suit was 100 pounds. By the end we were completely stripped of our dignity and self-respect. After returning to California he says I was in a kind of spiritual hurt locker for three months. A bomb squad in a war zone presents dizzying variables Each time out James has a new puzzle to solve (Wheres the trigger? Is there a timer or are insurgents standing by with a button to push?) while Sanborn and the jittery specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) pirouette and focus and refocus their sights Young man at nine oclock holding a video camera. Three guys at six oclock. Cell phone (the last a potential detonator). Do you shoot them? Shoot into windows with kids nearby? Boal a journalist suggests what other scriptwriters havent that civilians can go bonkers from the pressure toofreezing in their cars or striding up to overanxious troops with idiotic pleasantries. (Where are you fromCalifornia?) Bigelow cinematographer Barry Ackroyd and editors Chris Innis and Bob Murawski form a crack unit of their own. There are sudden camera moves cuts a beat too quick and jumps from close-up to long shot that signal explosions are imminenteven when theyre not. Here is how I knew I was inside the movie. Under fire his weapon jammed from the sticky blood of its last operator James screams at Eldridge to clean the blood off the bullets and panicky Eldridge yells How? and James says Salivaand I found myself building up spit as if maybe I could help before the next onslaught. Even with the kicky technique and violent macho horseplay (in between missions the comrades-in-arms pummel one another) The Hurt Locker wouldnt click without characters of stature and actors to match. Renner has the wit to internalize Jamess hot-dog tendenciesto make him less not more theatrical with no wasted motion. (James wouldnt be much good defusing bombs if given to flamboyant gestures.) Mackie doesnt play Sanborn as a by-the-book killjoy but a man whod take honest joy in killing Jameswho does at times pose a threat to the units safety. Geraghtys Eldridge is an unholy mess wholly reactive and therefore undefended. A few name actorsmost memorably Ralph Fiennes as a brusque seasoned contract soldierpop up and go out with shocking speed. Normal movie-star rules are suspended. Its only after The Hurt Locker ends and your fight-or-flight instincts ebb that the flaws seem more apparent like the too-pat subplot about a kind but glib therapist (Christian Camargo) who decides to get out from behind the wire and go on a mission. The final shot though thrilling puts too fine a point on things. Last but maybe foremost are the politicsor lack of them. The question of what the hell these good men are doing in a culture they dont understand with a language they dont speak surrounded by people they cant read hangs in the air but is never actually called. Or is that why this movie rises above its preachy counterparts? Bigelows triumph is to show why they dont call that into question themselves. Shes deep inside their testosterone-soaked psyches where why has no meaning and sensation is all. 1 2 Next Share this story...

That cowboy attitude exasperates one combat-weary member (Anthony Mackie) of his Baghdad-based Bravo Company team and frightens another (Brian Geraghty) to furious tears. Whats the source of this grim bravado? Is this decent mans addiction to adrenaline the cost to todays American soldier of volunteering for such a crazy assignment one that requires a husband with a family thousands of miles away to lie down in the road in the hot sun next to a live bomb to disarm a deadly device while locals whose language he cant understand stare impassively? It so happens that The Hurt Locker takes place in Iraq. But geography is almost beside the point. What makes the film so essential is its pinpoint accuracy in mapping the disorienting roads a man can walk down when ?his job keeps him so close to death working for what sometimes feels like a distant principle. Director Kathryn Bigelow and journalist-screenwriter Mark Boal (whose blunt vivid script is based on reports from his 2004 stint in Baghdad embedded with an Army bomb squad) probe the intersection of bravery and obsession of risk and responsibility. (Guy Pearce and Ralph ?Fiennes make brief jolting cameo appearances as ?similar risk-takers.) The result is an intense action-driven war pic a muscular efficient standout that ? simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within as well as what it looks like on the ground. This aint no war videogame no flashy cinematic art piece; theres nothing virtual about this reality.

Today theres a report of one on a Baghdad street. Mission simple to define -- ""Let them know that if theyre gonna leave a bomb on the side of the road"" the staff sergeant says ""were gonna blow up their f---in road"" -- but way harder to accomplish. As he walks toward the contaminated area wearing a heavily insulated space suit on a 130-degree day he catches the corner-eyesight of a man about to use a cell phone. The spaceman turns and runs. Too late BOOM The bomb detonates and so does he. Blood seeps down his helmet visor like red rain on the wrong side of a car windshield. This is the first scene of The Hurt Locker which has its world premiere here at the Venice Film Festival before playing Sunday at the Toronto fest. No U.S. opening or distributor has been secured but that should change once festival people strap themselves in for this dynamite drive through the Iraq occupation. (Make that war.) Except for a few digressive scenes -- a solo sortie of personal vengeance a conversation about what it all means -- that could easily be cut from the 2 hr. 11 min. running time The Hurt Locker is a near-perfect movie about men in war men at work. Through sturdy imagery and violent action it says that even Hell needs heroes. The director Kathryn Bigelow has paraded her adroitness with complex stories about oddball characters in two curious subgenres Near Dark (1987) was the all-time teenage vampire love story Point Break (1991) the all-time surfer-heist movie. The scriptwriter Marc Boal is a journalist for Rolling Stone The Village Voice and Playboy which ran a story that Paul Haggis expanded into the sharpest of last years Iraq-related dramas In the Valley of Elah. These two filmmakers have pooled their complementary talents to make one of the rare war movies thats strong but not shrill and sympathetic to guys doing an impossible job. With the death of their boss and 38 days left in their rotation the two survivors -- Sgt. J.T. ""Bomber Mike"" Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) get a new guy Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) who lacks the dead mans leadership skills or his bluff camaraderie. James doesnt say much just does his own thing which is to keep little pieces of Baghdad from blowing up. On his first mission James releases a cloud of smoke protecting him from sharpshooters but obliterating his comrades view of him. (Theres another company ready to cover him closer to the action.) A taxi has just edged toward the suspected device; he tells the driver to back out of the area. No movement. James walks closer repeats the order; stillness. He puts his gun against the mans head ""Wanna back up?"" The car slides into reverse. ""Well if he wasnt an insurgent"" somebody says ""he sure is now."" Finding a string nearly buried in the street dirt James finds it attached to seven bombs and matter-of-factly snaps the wire for each. OK thats done. Piece of cake seven slices. Its a creepy marvel to watch James in action. He has the cool aplomb analytical acumen and attention to detail of a great athlete or a master psychopath maybe both. A quote from former New York Times Iraq expert Christopher Hedges that opens the film says ""War is a drug."" Movies often editorialize on this theme the man whos a misfit back home but an efficient imaginative killing machine on the battlefield. Bigelow and Boal arent after that. Theyre saying that in a hellish peace-keeping operation like the U.S. deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan (James previous assignment) the Army needs guys like James.

Radhika Kate Taylor Brad Wheeler From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 05 2008 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 13 2009 1022AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The following reviews are by Rick Groen and Liam Lacey plus James Adams James Bradshaw Guy Dixon Simon Houpt Mark Peranson Michael Posner Jennie Punter V. Radhika Kate Taylor and Brad Wheeler. Films are rated out of four stars and ranked accordingly and alphabetically. The Good the Bad the Weird Kim Jee-Woon (South Korea)  With one of the most exciting and possibly longest horse-chase gun battles committed to celluloid this Korean spaghetti western is both an exotic treat and an old-fashioned rollicking action pic. After meeting on a train in the Manchurian desert in the 1930s the destinies of a gifted bounty hunter a sadistic gang leader and an eccentric train robber become intertwined with that of a valuable map. The biggest budget Korean flick to date this film is visually rich and fully loaded with wildly inventive comedy and action sequences. The director has fun with conventions yet the movie feels fresher than Hollywoods most recent batch of westerns. J.P. Sept. 12 930 p.m. Roy Thomson; Sept. 13 230 p.m. Elgin Hunger Steve McQueen (U.K.)  The debut film from Turner Prize-winning artist Steve McQueen is a harrowing experience and a rule-breaking tour de force. Hunger focuses on the 1981 death of Irish hunger striker Bobby Sands over the course of 66 days in the Maze prison. Without endorsing Sandss and his fellow IRA soldiers tactics the film places his death in the context of religious martyrdom and portrays the choice of extreme physical degradation - naked and starving in excrement-covered cells - as a form of sacrifice echoing Christs death. Thats not the same as saying McQueen endorses their actions. At the films centre comes an extraordinary single-take 20-minute conversation between Sands (Michael Fassbender) and a sympathetic priest (Liam Cunningham) who tries to convince him this is an ego-driven suicide mission by a man who is no longer in his right mind. For those who are expecting Ken Loach-style propaganda thats not McQueens aim. This is a portrait of a hideous human drama with distinct resonances of the martyrdom and torture in the post-9/11 world. The prison guards here are also victims in a literal sense They were killed by IRA assassins at the same rate as the prisoners starved to death. L.L. Sept. 6 930 p.m. Scotiabank 1; Sept. 8 9 a.m. Scotiabank 2 JCVD Mabrouk El Mechri (France/Belgium/Luxembourg)  Loaded with hilarious in-jokes and packing an unexpected emotional wallop this smart postmodern hostage pic stars martial-arts action thesp Jean-Claude Van Damme as a washed-up version of himself. In this brave career jolt Van Damme transforms his leaden acting into Buster Keaton deadpan pitch-perfect for the string of humiliations - a custody battle losing a role to Steven Seagal an unco-operative ATM - that lead his character to a botched Brussels post-office heist. Cops fans and his parents gather believing hes gone postal. But can this celebrity become a real-life hero? JCVD opens the Midnight Madness program in style. J.P. Sept. 4 1159 p.m. Ryerson; Sept. 5 315 p.m. Scotiabank 1 Rachel Getting Married Jonathan Demme (U.S.)  Many films have used the ritual of a wedding to peer into the dysfunctions of a troubled family but none better than this. In its raw honesty and emotional grit Demmes work here is unsurpassed. Borrowing a little from Robert Altman and a little more from the Dogme directors Demme brings a probing camera to the gathering of a Connecticut clan digging beneath the surface of the rehearsal party chatter - the gaiety real and forced the speeches graceful and cringe-making - to examine some very large themes at a very intimate level themes like sin and atonement and the blood that sometimes runs thinner than water. As the sister who gets checked out of rehab long enough to attend the wedding Anne Hathaway delivers a nuanced and revelatory performance (expect Oscar to call). But so does Rosemarie DeWitt in the title role. The love/hate tension between them filtered through the crowd around them is almost voyeuristic in its intensity. Normally reserved for action flicks that edge-of-your-seat cliche has a new home here - the rawness will have you leaning into the screen often uncomfortable but always entranced. R.G. Sept. 6 630 p.m. Roy Thomson; Sept. 7 11 a.m. Elgin RR James Benning (U.S.)  Barring a change of mind or circumstance RR will be the last of James Bennings films shot on 16 mm and it ends with a locomotive pointedly stopped in front of a wind farm outside Palm Springs Calif. Its the last in a line of 43 trains shot across the U.S. each one a witness to Americas overconsumption. Those familiar with Bennings recent landscape films will be comforted by the fixed camera and the films continental scope but in RR the signified (the train) takes over from the signifier (the camera) each shot lasting as long as it takes for a train to traverse the frame. Each shot comes as a surprise and every one is mesmerizing yet RR acquires a cumulative power over its running time. A masterpiece of structural filmmaking. M. Peranson Sept. 7 630 p.m. Jackman Tulpan Sergey Dvortsevoy (Germany/Switzerland/ Kazakhstan/Russia/Poland) 1/2 Weird winner of the Un Certain Regard prize at Cannes Tulpan is Sergey Dvortsevoys first ""fiction"" feature after a number of equally immersive award-winning documentaries. The film finds young Asa coming back from naval service and being rejected as a suitor by Tulpan because his ears are humongous. Despite this humorous synopsis it would be a mistake to typify Tulpan as per the TIFF program guide as a warmly accessible film for all audiences This is serious filmmaking. What gives the animal-heavy Tulpan its real kick - and elevates it beyond the Weeping Camels of the ethnographic film world - is the way Dvortsevoy integrates non-fictional elements into a developed plotline. Its an extension of what he calls ""life cinema"" showing the simplicity and warmth of the world by mixing naturalism and poetry. The strategy comes to a head with the filmic moment of the year perhaps the greatest on-camera animal birth in cinema history. M.

Folman was present at the most notorious episode of that war the massacres of hundreds of Palestinian refugees at the Sabra and Shatila camps in Lebanon conducted by Christian Phalangists in an area of Israeli control. The film is presented as the filmmakers quest to recover his own blocked memories of the event; it involves a series of intersecting stories that eventually converge on the three days of the massacre. The film uses a detailed realistic animation technique. The stories often based on the soldiers recurring nightmares add sequences of surreal horror to the depictions of actual fighting. Ultimately Folmans film reaches its climax when the technique switches from animation to stark archival footage of the aftermath of the killings. L.L. Sept. 4 9 p.m. Ryerson; Sept. 7 4 p.m. AMC 3 When It Was Blue Jennifer Reeves (U.S./Iceland) 1/2 Reevess captivating tour de force explodes all preconceptions about both experimental and environmental film. When It Was Blue is a frenetic double-projection montage structured in four parts representing the directions of the compass and the seasons; this is a serious eye-popping work that examines the beauty still present in our endangered world as seen by a talented artist. Reeves spanned the globe (including Vancouver Harbour) then hand-painted her 16 mm images resulting in a wide-ranging play on the notion of ""blue"" - the colour the sensation the sinking realization that the natural world (and 16 mm film) must be captured as much as possible before it disappears. The screening will be accompanied by haunting music from a band led by Icelandic composer Skuli Sverrisson who wrote the score and should be a cant-miss event. Take that Godfrey Reggio. M. Peranson Sept. 8 9 p.m. Jackman Che Steven Soderbergh (U.S./Spain/France)  Grand folly or almost masterpiece? That was the tone of the debate when Steven Soderberghs 41/2-hour two-movie Spanish-language film biography of Ernesto (Che) Guevara was unveiled before the press in Cannes in May. In fact the double movie represents a solid though not revolutionary achievement. Both films are handsomely shot mostly outdoors with limpid high-definition digital cinematography but they are otherwise distinct in tone and style. Che Part 1 Argentine is an action film which covers the improbable success of Fidel Castro Guevara (Benicio Del Toro) and their rag-tag army to overthrow Cuban dictator Juan Batista. The film moves through superbly staged series of famous battles leading to the governments overthrow intercut with sequences of Che reviewing his career and flirting with ABC correspondent Lisa Howard (Julia Ormond) and his 1964 speech to the United Nations. Part 2 Guerilla begins shortly before Che disenchanted with governing and wanting to spread the revolution through Latin America sneaks into Bolivia where he hoped to train guerrillas and lead a revolution. The second film progresses toward disaster as relentlessly as the first film did toward triumph. The local peasants and Communists wont work with him; the government backed by the CIA has his fighters on the run before they have had time to train. A measure of the movies strength and weakness is its reliance on Del Toros charisma in the central role In the films second half he disappears from the screen in several scenes and the film devolves into a confusing chronicle of political infighting amidst doomed and frightened soldiers in matching hats and beards. L.L. Che (Part 1 and 2) Sept. 12 9 a.m. Ryerson; Che (Part 1) Sept. 9 9 p.m. Elgin; Sept. 11 230 p.m. Elgin; Che (Part 2) Sept. 10 9 p.m. Elgin; Sept. 12 230 p.m. Elgin Cloud 9 Andreas Dresen (Germany)  A controversial Canadian comedy at last years festival was YPF which stood for Young People Fucking. Cloud 9 from German director Andreas Dresen ( Summer in Berlin) might be called OPF. This modest heartfelt drama follows a seamstress and married grandmother Inge (Ursula Werner) who makes one too many adjustments on a handsome customers trousers and the next thing you know shes in a head-over-heels affair. For a while she tries to hide her erotic awakening from her depressive husband Werner (Horst Rehberg) but she is unable to slip back into her routine life. The erotic warmth between the seniors has a palpable glow even if their naked bodies have a few more folds and lumps than we usually see on the movie screen. There really isnt much more to the story except the familiar message that at any age one persons liberation can be anothers downfall. L.L. Sept. 5 3 p.m. Scotiabank 4; Sept. 11 645 p.m. Scotiabank 1 Dernier Maquis Rabah Ameur-Zaimeche (France/Algeria)  The third in a loose trilogy about the place of France and religion in the minds of Algerian immigrants Rabah Ameur-Zaimeches quietly daring Dernier Maquis mostly takes place in an isolated industrial park near Paris where lower-class workers are engulfed by striking stacks of red pallets - quite literally billions of them. The boss named Mao (played by the director) is a Muslim who employs other Algerian workers in his factory and causes a storm when he decides to build a mosque and appoints the new imam by edict. Ameur-Zaimeche approaches his themes using a loose episodic structure including a terrific digression involving a wayward raccoon and as such has made an eye-opener that sneaks up on the viewer giving a real feel for how these workers approach their daily lives with both humour and anxiety. M. Peranson Sept. 5 1215 p.m. Scotiabank 4; Sept. 6 615 p.m. AMC 5; Sept. 11 9 a.m. Scotiabank 3 Happy-Go-Lucky Mike Leigh (U.K.)  Sally Hawkins scooped up the best-actress award in Berlin for her endearing Chaplinesque turn as the irrepressible Poppy a garrulous London schoolteacher who is like a human Weeble No matter the adversity shell wobble a bit but wont fall down. The story is slight a series of scenes that edge along slowly and gratifyingly When her bike is nicked Poppy takes driving lessons from an instructor (the fabulous Eddie Marsan Reg in Leighs Vera Drake) who seethes with ugly inchoate rage; she watches a flamenco teacher spontaneously combust with her own comically unbridled passion; and she embarks on a tentative romance with a social worker possessing dreamy eyes. Even as Leigh captures lightning in a bottle - as is his wont he and his actors created the scenes through improvisation - he keeps things from veering into the mawkish or twee and allows the dark to creep in where it may. A lovely small-scale gem. S.H. Sept. 8 7 p.m. Isabel Bader; Sept. 10 9 a.m. Scotiabank 2 The Hurt Locker Kathryn Bigelow (U.S.)  Bigelows latest is mostly a series of set pieces. But what set pieces Always a master kineticist Bigelow outdoes herself in this 130-minute epic centred on a company of U.S. grunts charged with defusing one improvised explosive device after another in and around pre-surge Baghdad. The company has only 38 days left in its tour of duty when a swaggering Jeremy Renner joins the unit as its hot-shot bomb-disposal technician. Are his smarts and adrenalin-addiction going to keep them safe - or get them all killed? Bigelow and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd crank up the tension to nail-biting gut-churning extremes and the mayhem is powerfully visceral. Some may chafe at the films lack of context but havent 51/2 years of war given us all the context we need? J.A. Sept. 8 6 p.m. Ryerson; Sept. 10 9 a.m. Ryerson Il Divo Paolo Sorrentino (Italy/France)  Giulio Andreotti was the central figure in a half-century of Italian postwar politics; a seven-time prime minister who in spite of his gnomic unprepossessing appearance and lack of charisma stayed in power thanks a set of machinations that would make the Borgias blush. Unlike most political biopics director Paolo Sorrentinos film is pure exuberant razzle-dazzle including ironic voice-over playful graphics and a blackly humorous montage of the ""natural"" deaths that came to Andreottis rivals. (Often accused Andreotti was always acquitted). The film gets a bit abstract when it catches up to the prime ministers seventh parliament in the early nineties exploring the leaders elaborate links to the Vatican organized crime and big business; most viewers may get lost in the tangle. Fortunately theres always the fascination of watching actor Toni Servillo who does a brilliant job of playing Andreotti (known as Beelzebub) as a kind of devil with a clowns exterior. L.L. Sept. 9 430 p.m.; Winter Garden; Sept. 11 9 p.m. Scotiabank 3 Il y a longtemps que je taime (Ive Loved You So Long) Philippe Claudel (France)  Kristin Scott Thomas goes dowdy and deep as a woman tentatively emerging after being locked away in a metaphorical and literal prison. Fifteen years after going to jail for an unspeakable crime whose details only slowly trickle out Juliette Fontaine (Scott Thomas) is taken in by the family of her younger sister Lea (Elsa Zylberstein) who longs to rebuild their relationship. Director Claudel a French writer best known for his First World War tale Les ames grises makes an impressive feature debut that exhibits a novelistic control of narrative and interest in peopling his frame with a landscape of fully formed characters. S.H. Sept. 10 8 p.m. Winter Garden; Sept. 12 1145 a.m. Scotiabank 4 Le Silence de Lorna (Lornas Silence) Jean-Pierre Dardenne Luc Dardenne (Belgium/France/Italy)  The directing-writing team of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne is best known for its documentary-style dramas of marginalized youth in contemporary Belgium (including Palme dor winners Rosetta and The Child). The brothers latest film is for the Dardennes almost a straightforward thriller. Actress Arta Dobroshi plays Lorna a young Albanian woman who has become caught up in a criminal scheme to get citizenship for a Russian criminal. As the film starts she has already completed the first stage marrying a disposable drug addict to get her citizenship. Then her conscience kicks in. Lornas Silence is probably the Dardennes most conventional-looking effort to date shot in 35-mm in the relatively attractive city of Liege. The apparent thriller sets up an unexpected allegorical ending. Perhaps not quite the razor-sharp effort of their last few films Lornas Silence proves the Dardennes arent afraid of looking conventional. L.L. Sept. 7 6 p.m. Scotiabank 1; Sept. 10 945 p.m. Scotiabank 1 Lheure dete (Summer Hours) Olivier Assayas (France)  Director Olivier Assayass slender but perfectly pitched family drama serves as an exploration of the legacy of French culture in the modern world. (Like Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsiens Flight of the Red Balloon the film was commissioned by Pariss Musee dOrsay to celebrate its 20th anniversary.) An imperious mother (Edith Scob) summons her adult children to her home and assigns her son (Charles Berling) with the task of dispensing her inheritance including some prized furniture and a painting collection by her beloved uncle. One sibling (Juliette Binoche) is a designer living in New York; another (Jeremie Renier) runs an Asian sneaker factory. Neither places the same value on these objects as their brother does. Assayas who makes films both experimental and grandly traditional is expert at handling the subtle undercurrents of tension in this eminently civilized family facing a painful generational and global shift in values. L.L. Sept. 8 415 p.m. Winter Garden; Sept. 10 915 a.m. Scotiabank 3 Linha de Passe (Passing Line) Walter Salles Daniela Thomas (Brazil)  Walter Salless and Daniela Thomass drama set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro follows a family consisting of a maid and her four sons by four different fathers. Never less than competent occasionally engrossing the film suffers a little from what feels like a sociology lesson about the poverty trap served up in a family drama. Mom who works as a maid is pregnant again and is about to be laid off by her employer. One son Dario wants to be a professional soccer player but at 18 may already be too old; another has dedicated his life to religion. A third has a son of his own whom he rarely sees and cant support on his motorcycle-courier salary. Reginaldo the youngest is obsessed with finding his father. Their five stories followed from May to September each hit a climax on the same day. L.L. Sept. 5 245 p.m. Ryerson; Sept. 8 645 p.m. Scotiabank 1; Sept. 10 615 p.m. AMC 7 Liverpool Lisandro Alonso (Argentina/France/Netherlands/ Germany/Spain)  The latest from Argentine director Lisandro Alonso ( La Libertad Los Muertos) follows a middle-aged sailor returning to his mountain home in Tierra del Fuego where he comes to terms with his family history. Impatient viewers may grow frustrated with the precisely composed images sparse dialogue languid pace and a story in which most of the information is withheld but Liverpool has a strong retrospective impact and theres a not a false move here. L.L. Sept. 10 930 p.m. Jackman; Sept. 12 330 p.m. Varsity 5 Miracle at St. Anna Spike Lee (U.S./Italy)  A powerful film which few directors could deliver and none quite the way Spike Lee can. It swings between ensemble piece and close character studies following four stranded soldiers from the African-American 92nd Division the Buffalo Soldiers fighting behind enemy lines in Second World War Italy. The blunt horror of war and racial injustices are overwhelmingly real. And as ever Lee and his lead actors unveil centuries of black American history and value systems in even the most fleeting gestures and dialogue. The only complaint though a testament to Lees mastery is that what he gives us could easily have run nine or 10 hours rather than crammed into two-plus hours. Its that rich. G.D. Sept. 7 9 p.m. Elgin; Sept. 9 11 a.m. Elgin; Sept. 13 830 p.m. Ryerson OHorten Bent Hamer (Norway)  Dry absurdist comedy from the director of Factotum and Kitchen Stories (TIFF 03) follows the fortunes of quiet 67-year-old train conductor Odd Horten (Bard Owe) whose routine near-solitary life is transformed by a series of increasingly strange encounters after his retirement. Pedestrian events like selling a boat losing a pipe and an ice storm become opportunities for surreal observation but Hamer never allows things to get silly. After rescuing a rumpled retired diplomat with a gift for driving blind Odd is inspired to take a life-changing leap of faith. A film propelled by subtle joy. J.P. Sept. 4 845 p.m. Varsity 2; Sept. 6 1215 p.m. Scotiabank 3 Pescuit Sportiv (Hooked) Adrian Sitaru (Romani/France)  Director Adrian Sitarus first feature this darkly comedic and subtly cynical drama is set in a Romania where woman sell themselves by the side of the road for the price of a beer. Mihai is a stressed-out and disillusioned school teacher (a middle-aged rebel deftly created by Adrian Titieni) going on a picnic with his married lover Mihaela (Iona Flora plays the anxious and querulous younger woman) when they hit a prostitute on a country road. Believing they have killed her they panic and bundle her into their car; when she awakes she turns out to be a cheerfully manipulative character (a gleeful Maria Dinulescu) who hijacks their day out inserting herself into the evident fissures of their clandestine relationship. The results are Pinteresque but with more humour than menace. K.T. Sept. 8 930 p.m. Varsity 4; Sept. 11 945 a.m. Scotiabank 4; Sept. 12 530 p.m. Varsity 6 Sugar Anna Boden Ryan Fleck (U.S.)  A film geared toward the Slow Movement - that is for those in the mood to take the time to enjoy the simpler things in life. And what better theme than baseball and the story of a Dominican ace pitcher trying to make it the minor leagues? Rich in texture and colour music and aura Sugar follows the athlete through predictable ups and downs as he attempts to adjust to the American way. But that familiarity is the point. The film is about looking at America through the eyes of a new immigrant one who feels he has sometimes seen too much. G.D. Sept. 8 9 p.m. Scotiabank 4; Sept. 10 330 p.m. Scotiabank 2 Three Monkeys Nuri Bilge Ceylan (Turkey/France/Italy)  Fans of the moody elliptical films of Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan ( Distant Climates) will probably be divided by this latest film which is a departure from his usual wry and quiet dramas for an almost conventional movie with a plot straight from a forties film noir. When a politician accidentally kills a man with his car he persuades his chauffeur to take the rap in exchange for a payment when he gets released from jail. As the jail term goes on the chauffeurs wife and teenaged son suffer and the wife seeks out an advance payment. One bad thing leads to another. Ceylans approach is oblique emphasizing the after-effects more than the actions with a lot of frozen painful moments between the characters. Though Three Monkeys feels conventional compared with Ceylans other work it maintains its auteurist imprint especially the rich colour palette and suggestive HD camerawork that helped Ceylan take the best-director honours at Cannes this year. L.L. Sept. 5 915 a.m. Scotiabank 4; Sept. 6 1245 p.m. Scotiabank 1 Tokyo Sonata Kiyoshi Kurosawa (Japan/Netherlands/Hong Kong/China)  Known primarily in these parts as a genre filmmaker Kiyoshi Kurosawa proved he had just as much to say about the disintegration of a Japanese postnuclear family in 2003s Bright Future. Tokyo Sonata starts even gentler as a look at an increasingly common phenomenon earlier enshrined in Laurent Cantets Time Out the laid-off worker who pretends to still have gainful employment. In Japan the shame of such circumstance is toxic - it sickens the Sasaki family and Kurosawas film as a whole. To ruin any of the plot would be criminal (suffice to say criminal elements do in fact intrude) as this ordinary family deals with ordinary circumstances in arguably extraordinary ways especially in the films raucous second half. Though far from flawless its an adventurous work that is both disturbing and ultimately moving. M. Peranson Sept. 9 530 p.m. Scotiabank 1; Sept. 11 715 p.m. Isabel Bader; Sept. 12 215 p.m. AMC 7 Un conte de Noel Arnaud Desplechin (France)  It sure aint the Christmas ol Dickens imagined. The Vuillards are a Parisian family of dysfunctional overachievers bizarre enough to make The Royal Tenenbaums clan look like candidates for a Hallmark card. As they gather for the festive season and ghosts of tragedies past compete with demons of time present the battleground is drawn. Of course this being France irony and a certain insouciant hauteur are the weapons of choice. And dont expect a grain of sentimentality - the candour in this crowd borders on the brutal. Led by Catherine Deneuve as the least maternal of mamas the cast is uniformly sound and the direction always crisp even through a 21/2-hour journey. Yep this is intriguing fare illuminating in its very nastiness but the thing should come with an advisory For the sake of our seasonal sanity please open well before Christmas. R.G. Sept. 8 915 p.m. Scotiabank 2; Sept. 10 12 p.m. Scotiabank 2 Voy a Explotar Gerardo Naranjo (Mexico)  The passion discovery and confusion of first love is beautifully captured in Gerardo Naranjos dreamy yet energetic film about two misfit teens who fabricate a story that theyre on the lam when theyre actually camping out close to home. Roman is the self-destructive rich son of a politician and has been tossed out of every private school; Manu is a gentle imaginative soul yet world-weary at 15. As light comedy and tender romance gradually give way to darker themes Naranjo never strays from the tiny fragile universe the pair has constructed. A fest gem. J.P. Sept. 7 6 p.m. AMC 7; Sept 9 915 a.m. Scotiabank 4 Zack and Miri Make a Porno Kevin Smith (U.S.) 3/4 The star rating above is a hybrid. By conventional cinematic standards Zack and Miri Make a Porno is a 11/2 -star film a jejune mess of improbabilities and impossibilities. On the other hand it is a Kevin Smith movie - a critic-proof slacker-loving hose-headed world unto itself automatically ""deserving"" four stars. Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks are the titular (heh-heh) leads here. Pals since grade school and (platonic) roommates for years they decide to make a porn flick - ""Star Whores"" featuring Darth Vibrator and Lubed Guy-baller is their first attempt - to earn the money necessary to restore power and water service in their crummy Pittsburgh apartment. Much mayhem and potty-mouthed mirth ensue of course. Porn legend Traci Lords has a cameo while long-time Smith associate Jason Mewes looking like the young Iggy Pop reveals his full monty. J.A. Sept. 7 915 p.m. Ryerson; Sept. 9 3 p.m. Elgin Appaloosa Ed Harris (U.S.) 1/2 In his first directorial outing since Pollock Ed Harris is looking to paint himself a widescreen western but he seems stuck between palettes unsure of whether to go with the old-fashioned John Ford hues or take up a more revisionist Clint Eastwood brush. Harris stars along with Viggo Mortensen playing a pair of brutally efficient lawmen hired to clean up yet another bedevilled town. So far its a straight shooter but when Renee Zellweger pops up as the chubby-cheeked apex of a love triangle things start getting odd and oddly contrived. The film keeps promising to chip the rust off western myths only to lapse back into convention. By the time the strong silent type is riding off into the sunset Unforgiven has pretty near given way to unforgivable. R.G. Sept. 5 6 p.m. Elgin; Sept. 6 9 a.m. Scotiabank 2 Burn After Reading Joel and Ethan Coen (U.S.) 1/2 Coming off the sublime achievement of No Country for Old Men the Coen brothers get ridiculous again with a screwball comedy set deep in the heart of the Washington Beltway. Boosted by George Clooney Brad Pitt Frances McDormand and John Malkovich the star power is mega-wattage but theyre all dimming down to play variations on the same character - the narcissistic middle-aged loser. En route there are plenty of laughs at the periphery and if the centre of the tale doesnt hold maybe thats deliberate - the point is the pointlessness of a befuddled bureaucracy. Some will find this a quirky amusement that like The Big Lebowski is destined for cult status; others will just want to burn after watching. R.G. Sept. 5 930 p.m. Roy Thomson; Sept. 6 11 a.m. Elgin The Duchess Saul Dibb (U.K.) 1/2 Oh but the Brits do it so prettily putting the costume in the drama and in this case Keira Knightley into the late 18th-century role of Georgiana Spencer the Duchess of Devonshire - fashion plate renowned wit and distant relation of Princess Di. With revolution in the global air poor ""G"" struggles in the harness of her marriage to a duke locked into his own brutish notions of chauvinistic duty. Still those bluebloods arent exactly shrinking violets - cue the serial infidelities the menages a trois the children born in and out of wedlock. The soap is definitely sudsy here but these liaisons lack danger and the school for scandal tends to the sophomoric. Really its just a bodice-snipper. R.G. Sept. 7 630 p.m. Roy Thomson; Sept. 8 230 p.m. Elgin Stone of Destiny Charles Martin Smith (Canada/U.K.) 1/2 The gala closer for this years festival Stone of Destiny is a heist film with a nationalist twist. Based on a true story it features Charlie Cox as a Scottish student who in 1950 hits on the idea of energizing the moribund Scottish independence movement by stealing the emblematic Stone of Scone installed in Westminster Abbey by the English 650 years before. Smith who also wrote the screenplay is all brisk efficiency over the course of the movies fat-free 96 minutes. J.A. Sept. 13 6 p.m. Elgin; Sept. 13 8 p.m. Roy Thomson Synecdoche New York Charlie Kaufman (U.S.) 1/2 Self-defeatingly clever screenwriter Charlie Kaufmans directorial debut is the story of a man (Philip Seymour Hoffman) caught in the agonies of creation his troubled relationships with women and his confusion between reality and fantasy. A promising half-hour sets up Hoffman as a death-obsessed stage director in upstate New York and his relationship with his daughter and emotionally distant artist wife Adele (Catherine Keener). Between visiting doctors to deal with an increasingly alarming series of ailments Caden works on his vast multiyear masterpiece. As the external reality disappears so does the viewers reason to care.

War may be hell but watching war movies can also be hell especially when they dont get to the point. Often gripping at a straight thriller level but increasingly weakened by its fuzzy (and hardly original) psychology Kathryn Bigelows ""The Hurt Locker"" centered on an elite U.S. bomb squad in Baghdad doesnt bring anything new to the table of grunts-in-the-firing-line movies. Modest biz looks likeliest. Though pic has yet to garner a U.S. distrib its B.O. fortunes especially Stateside will depend to a large extent on its reception at Toronto and on whether marketing the film more as a thriller will be enough to overcome auds resistance to Iraq War movies. Internationally Bigelows cult rep could be a further plus on the back of good reviews. The major problem with the script by journalist Mark Boal who was embedded with a bomb squad in Baghdad four years ago is that its unclear where the drama in ""Locker"" really lies. Its emphatically not a ""cut the red wire"" countdown thriller -- these guys get by on old-fashioned guts and instinct rather than sissy hardware -- but its not a pure men-under-stress drama either. In fact Boals script stirs a little of everything into the pot which boils down into seven setpieces divided by brief intervals of camaraderie/conflict among the three protags. Three of the setpieces dont even involve defusing bombs and are basically there to broaden the action and deepen the characters. But whether its the adrenaline rush a death wish macho posturing or just ""doin a job"" that drives these men is little clearer by the end than it is at the beginning. After an opening quotation that ""war is a drug"" pic jumps straight into the action as an Explosive Ordinance Disposal team led by iron-jawed Sgt. Matt Thompson (Guy Pearce) is called in to examine a suspicious pile of rubble. When the robotic hardware goes on the fritz Thompson ""suits up"" in protective clothing and does the job by hand -- recklessly as it proves. Attention-grabbing opening reel -- with handheld slightly grainy lensing nervous cutting and one sound effect that will test any theaters woofers -- sets the tone and much of the content of the next two hours. When Staff Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) arrives to take Thompsons place as head of the three-man unit its clear hes even more of a cowboy than his predecessor. Conflict between him and his deputy by-the-book Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) comes to a head early on. Meanwhile cornball Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) is taking voluntary counseling with a Bravo Company colonel Cambridge (Christian Camargo). Unlike many men-in-war movies ""Locker"" concentrates on a small number of characters that are clearly identifiable from the start. Even in the setpieces involving considerable military backup the dramatic focus is kept tight on the three protags. Especially in their first two assignments this works very well with James the guy on the ground while Sanborn rat-a-tats orders as he and Eldridge scan the surrounding buildings for snipers or trigger men. Its when the movie starts to fan out at the 45-minute mark -- with a developing friendship between James and a jive-talkin Arab kid ""Beckham"" (Christopher Sayegh) -- that the script starts to show signs of artificially straining for character depth. As the end of Bravo Companys rotation approaches James threatens to go off the rails in some highly manufactured (and not especially enlightening) ways. Flip-flop final reel is limp. After a couple wobbly entries (""The Weight of Water"" ""K-19 The Widowmaker"") its good to see Bigelow again flexing her gift for sheer physicality. Even when the men are mouthing commonplace dialogue or male-bonding cliches theres a real feel for them on a flesh-and-blood level. Helmers ability to create a sense of ever-present menace seen in her early pictures pumps up scenes in which the trio is silently ""observed"" by hostile/curious Arab bystanders. Film steers clear of questioning the U.S. presence in Iraq and with a couple brief exceptions treats its entire Arab cast as either faceless cannon fodder or potential threats. This may sit uneasily with some viewers even though its clear early on that this is more a dramatic choice than a political one. Renner is fine as James especially in his freewheeling early scenes played off against his suspicious colleagues. Its basically Renners film Mackie and Geraghty are just OK and other roles are bits. Ralph Fiennes pops up briefly as a Brit mercenary and David Morse contributes a memorable thumbnail of a complete military psychopath. As the 1949 bomb-squaddie classic ""The Small Back Room"" proved antsy cutting and camerawork and gritty processing arent necessarily de rigueur for building tension. Still Barry Ackroyds lensing halfway between faux-docu and regular drama is highly emotive equally textured in sun and shade catching the immensely realistic detail in pics production and costume design. (Like Brian De Palmas ""Redacted"" the film was shot in Jordan.) Editing of the mountain of footage captured by multiple Super 16 cameras is aces kinetic but not aggravatingly so. Music is either bland or simply atmospheric.
