Considering the frosty reception given ""Les Visiteurs"" by even the most ardent Francophiles among U.S. arthouse devotees an Americanized remake -- especially one with the same director and two lead players -- might seem a dubious enterprise if not a fools errand. But ""Just Visiting"" a slightly shorter and significantly less frenetic reprise of the 1993 comedy that broke box office records (and generated a 1998 sequel) in France should prove more palatable to mainstream auds on this side of the ocean. Without major marquee allure to attract ticketbuyers -- and perhaps more importantly with a coming-attractions trailer that isnt at all enticing -- pic isnt likely to be a long-term tenant at many theaters. As cable and homevid fare however it may be a welcome guest in many homes. Jean Reno arguably best known to U.S. moviegoers for ""Godzilla"" and ""Mission Impossible"" reprises his portrayal of Count Thibault of Malfee a noble knight whos inadvertently transported from the 12th century to contemporary times by an unreliable wizard (originally Pier Vial now Malcolm McDowell). And Christian Clavier co-screenwriter of the original and the remake returns as Andre the dim-witted servant whom Thibault treats like a dog and feeds accordingly. Thibault and Andre are dropped into a ""time corridor"" that leads to Chicago where artifacts from the noblemans castle are on museum display. For once something got added in the translation. Maybe some credit should go to John Hughes who helped co-writers Clavier and Jean-Marie Poirie retrofit their original ""Visiteurs"" script. The remake like its predecessor is top-heavy with broad slapstick mistaken identities and gross-out gags about Andres undiscriminating eating habits. But ""Just Visiting"" is appreciably less frenzied as it strings together bits and pieces of comical nonsense emerging as a one-joke comedy that is good for more than a few good laughs. The gags many of them recycled from ""Visiteurs"" are fairly predictable The time-travelers mistake a car for a dragon assume small people are trapped inside a TV set marvel at electricity and other modern-day wonders etc. Even so the wackiness quotient is maintained at a level that is modestly amusing not gratingly obnoxious. And to their credit the makers of the remake play fair During the early 12th century scenes which detail Thibaults betrothal to a British noblewoman they firmly establish that the knight and his squire speak English. That way its not such a big deal when theyre able to communicate in their own fashion with modern-day Chicagoans. Reno strikes a nice balance of pomposity and nobility canniness and cluelessness as Thibault tries to regain his equilibrium in the strange new world of 21st century Chicago. Clavier remains a pratfalling clown with an aggressively goofy streak. Hes easiest to take when he finds a kindred spirit in an overworked gardener Angelique played as a spirited neo-bohemian by Tara Reid. A most pleasant surprise is Christina Applegates winning performances in two key roles Rosalind Thibaults beautiful British fiancee whose untimely demise triggers the noble knights time-traveling; and Julia Thibaults only living 21st century descendant whos sweetly oblivious to the infidelities of Hunter (Matthew Ross) her manipulative boyfriend. Hunter wants to marry Julia for the money shes certain to have if she sells her familys ancestral home back in France. Supporting players are a mixed bag. Ross is a standard-issue slick no-goodnik. As Amber Hunters sexy babe on the side Bridgette Wilson-Sampras is allowed to do little more than flash a bit of cleavage and roll provocatively across a desk. Fortunately George Plimpton doesnt even get to do that much as a befuddled museum director. Malcolm McDowell is largely wasted as the wizard who makes the mistake of sending Thibault and Andre forward in time. Character also makes the great leap to 21st century but pic doesnt give him anything funny to do after he arrives. A co-production of Disneys Hollywood Pictures and Gaumont filmed on location in Chicago and at Shepperton Studios in England ""Just Visiting"" makes sparing but effective use of Igor Sekulics first-rate f/x work to enhance some sight gags. Other tech values are solid. Just VisitingProductionA Buena Vista release of a Hollywood Pictures production in association with Gaumont. Produced by Patrice Ledoux Ricardo Mestres.

(Walt Disney) Theyre back. Im talking Jean Reno and Christian Claver who reprise their roles as zany time travellers in the 1993 French comedy ""Les Visiteurs."" Also returning is director Jean-Marie Gaubert who basically redoes his movie for American multiplex audiences with the help of co-writer John Hughes. In the 12th century French nobleman Thibault (Reno) is on the eve of his marriage to the fair Rosalind (Christina Applegate) when deceitful trickery (courtesy of a court schemer and a witch) causes a great tragedy involving his beautiful bride. With the help of an English wizard (Malcolm McDowell who shows up in the strangest places) Thibault and his valet Andre (Clavier also a co-writer) transport themselves through time intending to undo this treachery and preserve Thibaults lineage. Instead theyre catapulted into the future to 21st-century Chicago which just happens to be where co-writer Hughes comes from. With the help of Thibaults descendant Julia (also Applegate) the medieval trio attempts to return to the past. But not before they have tangled with more treachery this time from Julias slimy fiance Hunter (Matthew Ross). If you saw the French version well here it is in Disney language with John-Hughes-style slapstick. The Frenchmen - real fish out of water - ""kill"" a sports utility van wreak unintentional havoc in Julias bathroom and kitchen display outrageous behavior in a swanky restaurant mistake the deodorant bar in a urinal for after-dinner mints and so forth. Some of these gags are very funny and its a pleasure to see Reno as something other than a villain in an English language picture. ""Just Visiting"" (PG-13 88 minutes) - Contains a little foul language crude humor and small hints of sexuality.

Good. Go Home. By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 6 2001 Jean Reno and Christina Applegate in ""Just Visiting."" (Walt Disney) Ah the Middle Ages pestilence ordure slaughter and T-shirts made of chain. That lovely epoch impinges upon our own in the curiously unfunny ""Just Visiting"" which turns out to be about two wild n crazy guys from the 11th century who end up in todays Chicago where this movies level of humor demands that they wash their faces in a toilet bowl. Its based on the most successful movie the French ever made and if only you could blame the usual suspects the parvenus of Hollywood for crushing a delicate Gallic bloom. But you cant because the French themselves seem to have all too willingly enjoyed desecrating their own creation. One hopes the pay was good. ""Les Visiteurs"" Jean-Marie Gauberts 1993 film followed the adventures of the Duke of Anjou Thibault (Jean Reno) and his goofy manservant Andre (Christian Clavier) in modern-day Paris where an errant wizard had inadvertently deposited them. In ""Just Visiting"" of 2001 (or of 2000 its original release date) the movie directed by the same Jean-Marie Gaubert follows the same two lummoxes again played by Reno and Clavier only this time the Wizard has dumped them in present-day Chicago. Hes also taught them English. Those wacky wizards. So much of the fun of the film when it offers fun follows immediately upon the French original which itself follows from the classic oeuvreof the farceurs of the grand French tradition Les Trois Stooges. That is a lot of it is low crude admittedly comic in the rudest positive sense which involves a lot of falling down to humorous effect. You can imagine how daunted the two time travelers are by an automobile (they think its a dragon). Airplanes paralyze them while urinals seem the holiest of accomplishments. In fancy restaurants they belch and pass wind and throw bones on the floor. In one inspired moment of zaniness the moronic Andre tries to roast a chicken on an umbrella. But Thibaults aristocratic self-assurance soon clicks in and soon hes lording it as he believes is his God-given right over poor cowering Andre who is used to running behind the horse -- a slightly different ordeal when the horse is mechanical traveling 60 mph down the Dan Ryan Expressway. Alas theres a story too and I mean other than the feckless fall-down-go-boom stuff which is at least occasionally funny. It seems that Thibaults arrival has been arranged in response to a political crisis in his own century A witch in the employ of a conniving noble competitor has enchanted him leading him to stab his beloved fiancee Rosalind (Christina Applegate) for which he has been sentenced to face the axman. The wizard (Malcolm McDowell) a political ally if an idiot is trying to return him to a point in time where he can prevent his enchantment; he simply dumps Thibault in the wrong corridor in time. Thibault ends up in Chicago under the feeble pretext that it is in the Windy City that his preserved bedroom (from the old castle) is on display in a museum. It turns out this donation was masterminded by his great-great-many-times-great-granddaughter Julia - Applegate again looking paler than she did in the 11th century - and so he quickly makes her acquaintanceship then earns her friendship and ultimately her loyalty. It turns out that Julia the last heiress to the fabulous ancient Malfret fortune is just about to dispose of it at the insistence of her controlling boyfriend Hunter (Matt Ross). But this we learn is a scam; Hunter is using Julia to get her money while hes secretly in love with Amber a curvaceous mouth-breather played by poor Mrs. Pete Sampras (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) who seems to have inherited this niche in Hollywood casting fancy. So the tiny little arc of story chronicles two emotional developments how under the influence of the heroic knight Julia finds the strength to defy her dominating treacherous boyfriend; and how the peasant servant Andre makes the intellectual breakthrough that enables him to conceive of himself as a man not a servant. But neither of these stories really convinces. Applegate is too wan and the putatively smarmy Ross hardly ever seems consequential. As for Clavier one of the great screen comedians of Europe (and a co-author of both this screenplay and the original) he doesnt register with any particular force. Hes a shaggy ill-defined presence and his abnegation while funny grows plaintive. Only Reno magnificent behind that rumbly baritone voice truly knightly and majestic stands out in the film. Indeed ""Just Visiting"" is far better in its expensive evocation of the 11th century than in its endless visit in ours.""Just Visiting"" (90 minutes) is rated PG-13 for sexuality and violence.

Directed by Marzieh Meshkini . (Not rated. 74 minutes. In Farsi with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) In ""The Day I Became a Woman"" the newest entry in the Shooting Gallery film series Iranian director Marzieh Meshkini tells three interlinking tales -- each one a feminist fable about the struggle for independence. Its a marvelous debut for Meshkini the wife of filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf (""The Silence""). Each of her stories has the timeless quality of a fable and each has wisdom and a quiet stoic sense of defiance in the face of patriarchal tradition. The first ""Havva"" finds a 9-year-old girl with one hour left before she becomes a woman and has to sever ties with her best friend a young boy. The girl played with perfect simplicity by Fatemeh Cheragh Akhtar doesnt understand these customs. As her last minutes of childhood count down she manages a vague wistful comprehension of the changes she faces. In ""Ahoo"" the second episode a young housewife disobeys her husband by riding in an all-women bike marathon. On horseback the husband catches up with and berates her telling her to dismount. Defiant she keeps riding until a number of men overpower her. Finally in ""Houra"" an old crone goes on a shopping spree buying an array of household items that she was always denied. Theres a thematic thread among these stories and a unifying quality -- call it chutzpah -- shared by the three female protagonists. Meshkini draws them with affection and frames their stories with graceful compositions and slow easy pacing. In the end its easy to imagine them as manifestations of the same person. -- Edward Guthmann SECRETS OF SILICON VALLEY Documentary. Directed by Alan Snitow and Deborah Kaufman. (Not rated. 60 minutes. Today through Wednesday at the Fine Arts in Berkeley April 18 at the Rafael Film Center in San Rafael April 24-26 at the Towne in San Jose.) Judging by its title ""Secrets of Silicon Valley"" might be a press release from a high-tech public-relations firm. More chest beating about technological advances? About the high-tech economic miracle and the ways in which its changing our lives? Think again. In fact ""Secrets"" is a bracing expose of the ""digital divide"" that separates Silicon Valley billionaires from the underpaid workers who keep the industry afloat. While high-level techies earn fortunes -- and the media celebrates a brave new world thats redefined communications and modes of business -- an underclass of ""temp slaves"" struggles to live on 8 an hour. Directed by Berkeley filmmakers Alan Snitow and Deborah Kaufman ""Secrets"" reveals the downside of a boom industry -- one in which companies use outsourcing and subcontracting to cut costs and allow certain workers (mostly white) to get rich while the rank and file (mostly nonwhite) cant afford to live decently. ""Secrets"" doesnt have an angry tone and yet the evidence it provides and the stories told by its two principal characters Magda Escobar and Raj Jayadev are disturbing. Escobar a Latina runs a low-income computer- training center in East Palo Alto but finds that inflated rents are forcing out the people she needs to reach. Jayadev an assembly worker in a Hewlett-Packard break packaging plant loses his job when he blows the whistle on pay inequities and health and safety conditions. ""Theres nothing new about this new economy"" Jayadev says. ""The only difference is that the (poor working conditions) arent acknowledged. "" -- Wesley Morris POKEMON 3 Animation. Directed by Michael Haigney. (G. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . If the kids are sleepier this time around ""Pokemon 3"" is too. The film is more inert than the first two ""Pokemons."" The odd subtexts include the Tao of capitalism cuddly critters as objects of euphemistic cockfighting and spiritual apocalypse all tied into a G-rated family-friendly knot. ""3"" is set in a verdant land called Greenfield and focuses on a girl who loses her Pokemon-hunter father to an ominous swirling entity. She thinks hes been reincarnated as a legendary feline Pokemon called Entai and demands that he go out and fetch her long-dead mother. Instead he comes back with Delia Ketchum the doting mom of adolescent Pokemon trainer Ash. Neither the girl nor Mrs. K -- both in some kind of post-traumatic consumer delirium -- can tell the difference. Ash knows though. But under the entitys spell Greenfield has become an impenetrable kingdom -- or a pulsing glittering radicchio. Ash will need a curiously strong vinaigrette to get her out that or his Pokemon buddies. Either way the stakes are pretty low. The first two films -- respectively about cloning and eco-friendliness -- had a greater sense of chaos and how to tame it. And the sarcasm of bumbling Pokemon catchers Team Rocket is kept to a cruel minimum. The series maudlin energies take over instead. Even little trainers pet Pikachu appears to have seen it all before. At times it all calls to mind Oz Narnia and the interplanetary squabbling of ""Battlefield Earth."" And the incidental themes of materialism persist The aforementioned entity is called the ""Unown"" a subliminal call to Americas children to turn in their tie-in tchotchkes. Although anyone living on the kiddie cutting edge knew halfway through the previous ""Pokemon"" flick what the folks responsible for this one cant admit Pokemon is over. Wheres our Power Puff Girls movie? -- Edward Guthmann JUST VISITING Comedy. Starring Jean Reno Christian Clavier and Christina Applegate. Directed by Jean-Marie Gaubert. (PG-13. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The time-travel comedy ""Just Visiting"" is as the French say amusing enough. They should know. This is an English-language remake of a 1993 French film. As ""Les Visiteurs "" it was a smash hit in France but didnt catch on in the United States in a subtitled version called ""The Visitors."" This new one keeps the same stars Jean Reno and Christian Clavier as a 12th century nobleman and his lackey but switches the modern locale from France to Chicago and adds digital effects for the bad-trip witchcraft that strands them in todays world. The formidable Reno (""The Professional"" ""The Big Blue"") holds the film together with his unwinking gravitas as a knight trying to get a handle on modern life but proudly sticking to his old ways. He treats his servant Andre (Clavier) with contempt and in return Andre invariably thanks him for each insult and instance of abuse. A lot of the humor deals with hygiene and sanitation as the middle-age Middle Agers try to cope with modern toilets kitchen utensils and such. The premise might tend to get tiresome but director Jean-Marie Gaubert who also did the French version brings it in under 90 minutes and ties all the loose ends together in a slick wrap-up. Christina Applegate (""Married . . . With Children"") plays the sword- wielding knights modern descendant and when he screws up and overreacts she will explain ""Hes French."" Advisory Contains gross-out humor. -- Bob Graham . ALL ACCESS Concert documentary. Directed by Martyn Atkins. (Not rated. 62 minutes. At the Sony Metreon.) Sting says the late Miles Davis once told him he had the biggest head. Turns out Miles had seen the singer in a movie on the big screen. A cross-section of todays pop stars -- Macy Gray Sheryl Crow Kid Rock -- get even bigger heads in this IMAX giant-screen concert documentary. The performances range from freaky (George Clintons riotous P-Funk) to unusual (Al Green with Dave Matthews) to just plain weird (the Roots with B.B. King and Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio). The sound is wonderfully state of the art. During Stings rehearsal take of ""Desert Rose"" with guest Cheb Mami cowbells and other percussion instruments are distinctly audible from overhead and behind even as the voices come at you head on. That clarity cant rescue such middle-of-the-road performances as Crows ""If It Makes You Happy"" performed solo on an empty soundstage or the great Rev. Greens goofy version of ""Take Me to the River"" performed with the Matthews band at Chicagos Soldier Field. Santana sounds sharp as ever but Rob Thomas guest spot on the smash ""Smooth"" only demonstrates how little star quality the Matchbox Twenty singer actually has. On the plus side Clintons house-party medley Mobys contemplative end piece and surprisingly the typically insufferable Kid Rock who rips through his signature song ""Bawitdaba"" with his late sidekick Joe C. at his knee. ""Music is a clearer indication of whats in somebodys soul than language"" says Anastasio in one of several bits of backstage footage. No argument there. But ""All Access"" never gets near the soul of todays pop music. -- James Sullivan . GYPSY BOYS Romantic comedy. Written and directed by Brian Shepp. (R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Brian Shepps ""Gypsy Boys"" is an eternal repetitive albeit earnest search for signs of intelligent (or at least emotionally available) life in a gay universe. Politically speaking the film is mum. Elsewhere it wont shut up. The men here are as vexed with the games and etiquette as the women of ""Sex and the City."" Shepp brings the fed-up attitude but none of the wit. For some guys watching a dozen characters comb San Franciscos AsiaSF nightclub for love sex and laughs might hit so close to home the experience could be like breaking and entering. Otherwise ""Gypsy Boys"" is wrecked by self-congratulatory pith that purports to get at the heart of the promiscuity but only inspires head scratching about why these are the lives writer-director Shepp chose to dramatize. The interwoven stories make up a sadly ordinary brutally plotless soap. It opens with its three most hapless characters searching for 25 spots on the body from which to drink champagne and ends with a literal pony ride into the sunset. Shepps observations might be ones youve had a hundred times and wished someone would put on film -- again only with worse lighting and a deeper house soundtrack. These guys are queer as folk too. To the films credit though the romantic angst seems less packaged and only slightly less pretentious than those on that Showtime series. Shepp proffers nothing new in the gay discourse department. But all the froth is warmed over too. Knights in shining armor (or skin so sweaty it gleams) and the men of the characters dreams come go and literally fade into the movies ether. Things never get deeper than the duo handing out doorway disses at the entrance of AsiaSF like ""Muppets"" armchair critics Statler and Waldorf. The sincere dramatic conflicts only beget more cliches. And in accordance with everything else in ""Gypsy Boys"" they are from the heart -- and the loins. Advisory This film contains strong language and sexual situations. -- Wesley Morris . HIT AND RUNWAY Comedy. Starring Michael Parducci Peter Jacobsen. Co-written and directed by Christopher Livingston. (R. 105 minutes. At the Lumiere.) A premise in search of a better-executed movie Christopher Livingstons ""Hit and Runway"" appears to be looking for a slot in the CBS lineup. Painfully untalented writer Alex (Michael Parducci) teams up with Elliot (Peter Jacobsen) a playwright to write an action movie and for a little while comedy ensues. Alex is a macho Italian. Elliots a gay Jew with a painful resemblance to Woody Allen. Livingston flirts with screwball satire and homage but gets tangled in conventions exactly the kind Alex would learn in his screen-writing night class. At its least grating ""Runway"" plays as a cheesy ode to unlikely creative partnerships. In the process of growing unbearably sentimental it snowballs into a criminally derivative copy of ""Manhattan""-era Allen. On its surface the film plays like a less fraught redux of the hetero-homo relations in ""Kiss Me Guido."" But Jacobsen appears to have been instructed to do Allen in the same way Livingston and co-writer Jaffe Cohen have cribbed the Woodmans lines and scenarios. The real fits of inspiration come early as Alex bribes Elliot into collaboration by promising him a date with Joey (""Dawson Creeks"" gay-hottie- in-residence Kerr Smith) the waiter/actor working at Alexs brothers restaurant. Joey happens to be a Judeo-phile a trait that yields a kiss thats like watching Sal Mineos mouth collide with Karl Maldens. Unclean but endearing anyway. The movie on the other hand with its strained stabs at straight romance (girls with glasses are hotter without them and other non- observations) is mostly unclean. -- Wesley Morris Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 9 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

"USATODAY.com - Also opening Pokemon 3 Just Visiting more Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/06/2001 - Updated 0918 AM ET Also opening Pokemon 3 Just Visiting more Pokemon 3 The Movie OK Time Warner a joke is a joke but the time of tolerance has passed. Get your creatures out of our faces unless youre willing to regale us by afflicting them with Mad Pokemon Disease. Aping its big-screen predecessors the latest Pokemon package begins with a short cartoon -- though this one is unique in that it can be comprehended. Pikachu and Pichu deals with innocent alley mischief in an unnamed big city and a narrator even explains periodically what is happening. Boy would this guy have been welcome in the more psychedelic shorts that accompanied the first two Pokemon movies. Cut to the so-called main event in which a professor of Pokemon is pulled into a mysterious world called the Unown (hey what happened to the ""k""?) joining a wife who disappeared two years earlier. Their daughter spends the rest of the movie seeing her most fantastic imaginings come true protected by a lion-ish ""Entai"" creature with a kind heart. The explosions in a climactic rescue mission wont faze kids; the movies final words may give adults malaria-like sweats. These allude to a ""next time."" (Rated G) -- Mike Clark Just Visiting While some of us were worried about Europe exporting foot-and-mouth disease a French-inspired movie has opened in the USA with foot-in-mouth disease. No disinfectant could clean up this misbegotten Americanized remake of Les Visiteurs a 1993 French hit about a 12th century nobleman and his servant who travel through time to the present. Jean Reno as the nobleman and Christian Clavier the servant played the same roles in the French original and its sequel. So its no surprise that they have comic chemistry and are comfortable with their characters allowing a few of the gags to work. (Clavier spends much of the movie eating and drinking strange things such as cologne and urinal cakes -- and those are the good gags.) And Malcolm McDowell isnt too bad as an English wizard. But despite a Chicago setting its the American cast members who seem out of place flailing as they struggle with their cartoon-ish roles. Christina Applegate could be funny on Married ... With Children but playing two roles here she is as bland as she was on Jesse. The rest of the actors do fidgety bits of business and ham it up with little comedic style. (PG-13 violence crude humor) -- Andy Seiler Shadow Magic Stories have been told about cinemas early days in America Britain Australia and France but China is a special case. What other country would have been so resistant to such a non-traditional form? In director An Hus English-language partly true story an unnamed Brit (Jared Harris) comes to Peking in 1902 peddling shadows on the screen. Though he is immediately denounced as rabble by fans of reigning opera star Lord Tan (Li Yusheng) the masses are excited by the dawn of movies. Among them is a still-photographers assistant (Xia Yu) who signs on with the cultural interloper and messes up his own future and arranged marriage with an older widow. The milieu is unusual and the movie looks more lavish than youd think its budget could allow. But the story doesnt exactly startle with surprises and has a tendency to hammer and rehammer its points. A few later scenes threaten to outstretch the Great Wall. Were ultimately told that by 1905 even the elderly Lord Tan was appearing before the camera. This was of course early enough for him to avoid seeing what the Marx Brothers would do to opera on screen 30 years later. (In New York and Los Angeles; PG for brief mild language) -- M.C. Beautiful Creatures Women can be just as scummy and conniving as men. We dont need any blackhearted noir thriller from Scotland to tell us that especially one this hateful. Vile violent and less hip than it thinks it is Creatures tries to wed the femme revenge angle of Thelma amp; Louise and Bound to the testosterone-on-ice cool of Snatch. But the filmmakers forgot to add sympathetic characters or employ flashy editing to relieve the cheap shocks and general ugliness onscreen. A couple of molls share dreadful taste in boyfriends. Dorothy (Susan Lynch of Waking Ned Devine) is hooked up with a volatile junkie and Petula (Rachel Weisz of The Mummy) cohabits with an abusive businessman. They meet when desperate Dorothy escaping from her trashed apartment happens upon Petula getting throttled by her boyfriend and rescues her by bashing him with a huge metal pipe. He dies and the women plot to pass his disappearance off as an abduction then abscond with the ransom. Sniffing about is a lecherous detective (Alex Norton) who smells a chance to cash in too. Weisz encumbered by a ratty platinum blond wig does a Marilyn Monroe manque while Lynch is supposedly the brains of the duo although its none too bright to keep returning to the scene of the crime. The sick humor (a disembodied ring finger is passed around) and sexual kink is less amusing than offensive. The only creature around who is admirable is Dorothys white Alsatian Pluto. The dog is the one male with an excuse for acting like an animal.

Just Visiting retools the 1993 comedy ""Les Visiteurs"" - a box office grand fromage in France a bombe here - with the same director male stars and premise A 12th-century knight (""Mission Impossible""s Jean Reno) and his idiot servant (Christian Clavier who cowrote both versions) time travel to our century whereupon much slapstick merriment ensues with cars and indoor plumbing. Whats the difference in the American remake? Blonds nifty CGI effects and personal growth. Christina Applegate plays Renos modern descendant a noodle with no self esteem and a rat boyfriend (Matthew Ross) until the knight teaches her to roar like a lion; Tara Reid is the working class chippy Clavier falls for. Since John Hughes cowrote the script someone gets hit in the crotch and the entire shebang has been moved to Chicago (dont ask why the time travelers arrive speaking English rather than Middle French). Except for one blissfully splattery meal in an upscale restaurant though ""Visiting"" forgoes the destructo silliness of the original in favor of one too many bland self help subplots. If its a decent time waster for older kids its also the equivalent of taking them to a McDonalds on the Champs Elysees.
