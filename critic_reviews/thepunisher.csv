Comments The Punisher Producers Avi Arad and Gale Anne Hurd must have learned their lesson from The Hulk after giving respected filmmaker Ang Lee a 120 million budget and watching his movie flop with critics and audiences alike theyve taken another Marvel Comics property and shot it on the cheap with a first-time director Jonathan Hensleigh. The result isnt any better but its certainly no worse and theres something to be said for letting a comic book adaptation operate at the level of a comic book dispensing cheap laughs and ice-cold sadism. Thomas Jane is the hard-bodied hero an FBI agent who turns vigilante after his family is assassinated by malevolent drug lord John Travolta. With Will Patton Laura Harring Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and a brief but welcome cameo by Roy Scheider. R 124 min. By J.R.

Thus did Marvel Comics-writer Garth Ennis introduce his muscled psycho of one-track vengeance. Yet even these intellectual ground zero expectations are disappointed in the unsteady comedy of this latest live-action adaptation whose hootsome script seems to have blown its own brains out amid the non-stop cartoon carnage. Special Agent Frank Castle (Tom Jane) is all set for a nice beach-house retirement before he inadvertently snuffs out the son of Tampa businessman Howard Saint (John Travolta) - sparking a bloodthirsty distinctly unthrilling eye-for-eye retribution even those Ancient Greek chappies might consider a tad unrestrained. Ultimately Franks victim -to-vigilante transformation is so morally unexplored its emotionally alienating.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Starring Thomas Jane John Travolta. Directed by JonathanHensleigh. Written by Hensleigh and Michael France. (R. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). A movie called ""The Punisher"" promises a high body count. Indeed people are thrown from bridges extended families are mowed down and body jewelry gets severely tweaked. But its a prevailing sense of humor that makes this an entertaining if silly film adaptation of the Marvel comic. John Travolta in his crazy/creepy mode certainly seems to have a good time. As a Tampa Fla. crime lord named Howard Saint he simmers and shouts and morphs his usual swagger into an insecure stiffness around the shoulders. The actor goes a little broader than even a comic-book film requires but he is always enjoyable. Saint has ordered the execution of FBI Special Agent Frank Castle (Thomas Jane Mickey Mantle in HBOs ""61"") and Castles whole family after Castle gets Saints son killed. The FBI man survives the slaughter to become the Punisher. Jane plays the Punisher as a grave downcast vengeance machine one who stays ab-tastic despite a daily bottle of Wild Turkey. In fact Janes torso resplendent in low-slung pants emotes as much as the actor does. But even Jane gets comic moments. Having strung up a Saint insider for a torture session the Punisher sears a steak on the stove as he pokes the criminal with a Popsicle. The sucker is convinced that his flesh is burning. Director and co-writer Jonathan Hensleigh has ensured that the title characters pain will resonate by staging a truly horrifying early sequence in which the Castle relatives are killed during a family reunion. The folks are enjoying a barbecue on the beach when Saints henchmen pull up in speedboats and kill everyone in sight. Movie violence registers more fully when its a middle-aged lady wearing Laura Ashley getting shot. Hensleigh and cinematographer Conrad W. Hall never make Tampa look menacing no matter how many times the camera ascends the facade of the mini- skyscraper where Saint practices evil. A nondescript setting actually fits the Punisher a comic book hero who relies on wits not superpowers. He dispenses regular-guy justice in fights with a guitar-wielding hit man and a giant killing machine called the Russian. The one-on-one showdowns are impressive but they dont make sense. Why would Saint with an army of enforcers at his disposal send in the clowns to go it alone? That question has to be filed next to the one about the police. Castle announces his intentions to the cops yet they never come around. The film hews closely to reality at times while making comic-book logic leaps at others. It can be an uneasy mix. His neighbors in a rundown apartment building help soften the Punisher. One is a skinny overly pierced techno-geek played by likable young actor Ben Foster (Claires gay boyfriend on ""Six Feet Under""). The geek goes toe to toe with the Saint familys consigliere played by the always fearsome Will Patton. As foreplay to his sadism the criminal adopts faux-parental concern asking the young man if hes enrolled in college. This unlikely standoff becomes the films tensest moment. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is bathed in a golden glow (inner light not camera work) as the waitress/domestic violence survivor next door. Down-on-their-luck Florida waitresses apparently still get great dental plans. Far more memorable is Samantha Mathis as Castles wife. She manages in a few brief scenes to help us understand why he was once a happy guy. Its earthbound premise lets ""The Punisher"" avoid the overuse of special effects found in some comic-book movies. But when it gets fake it gets really fake. For one action scene Travolta obviously used the services of a body double. Its obvious because the stuntman is way fatter than the actor. Come on. Travolta might not want to do the dirty work anymore but he doesnt deserve to be lampooned. -- Advisory This film contains extreme violence.

The Punisher Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-punisher-2004,200,thepunisher9,thepunisher,rogerebert
"Punisher inflicts suffering on viewers - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Punisher inflicts suffering on viewers By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  April 16 2004 Based on the Marvel Comics title ""The Punisher"" is about Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) a former Delta Force operative who devotes his life and his one apparent facial expression to killing the people who killed his family. By ""family"" I dont mean just his wife and son -- although theyre gunned down too -- but the entire clan mom dad aunts uncles cousins the caterers.The assassins work for the shady crypto-Latin ""nightclub owner"" Howard Saint (John Travolta) whose son died in the crossfire of one of Castles assignments. Saint is committed to revenge although his frosty wife Livia (Laura Harring) orders the family-wide hit on the Castles. Obviously the Saints missed somebody.Directed and co-written by Jonathan Hensleigh the movie is as grim and grave as the comic book. But it lacks atmosphere. Its often illogical and drubs you numb with its single dimension noisy retribution. There are rare bouts of fun. Certainly none of them are courtesy of Travolta who is inexplicably swishy and campy. He seems trapped obliviously in self-parody.Seeking revenge Castle traces Livia to Tampa spies on the familys chief henchman (Will Patton) and makes Saints money-laundering services seem suspect to his Cuban clientele. He moves into a gnarly industrial tenement where he creates an elaborate workshop. The buildings most visible residents happen to be a trio of outcasts the lovable slob (John Pinette); the nervous kid whose face is a gallery of piercings (Ben Foster); and the waitress (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) in hiding from her latest abusive boyfriend.They try to lighten up Castle and to little avail invite this large brooder into their freaky family. His afternoons though are filled with schemes to get at Saint and his nights are for Wild Turkey binges.Out on his missions Castle is clad in the trademark black T-shirt with its iconic long white skull. Wearing it is an act of sentimentality (it was a gift from his late son) yet the shirt is now so commonplace in the real world that Castle looks like a fan of the comic book not the star of the movie. The Punisher has no super powers -- though in the film being bludgeoned shot doused with gasoline and nearly blown up then walking away must make him a mutant of some kind. He just has a daunting physique a zillion guns and as Jane plays it a sinking seriousness.""The Punisher"" rarely gets out of its bad mood which is forgivable but the grimness has no witty original or resonant accompaniment. If youve seen one rogue law enforcer. . . The melancholy is so thick that the movie cant be bothered to move faster than 10 miles per hour. (In 1989 Dolph Lundgren starred in a version that at least hit the speed limit.)There is an effective sequence though between Castle and a big Russian played by Kevin Nash the professional wrestler whom Saint sends over to finish off Castle. Throwing each other through walls they demolish Castles apartment but they snap the movie awake with something beautifully close to style.Mostly though ""The Punisher"" makes a fetish of torture. In one scene Patton removes Fosters piercings. But whats deadening about the sequence is not the pointlessness but the indifference to the pain inflicted. ""The Punisher"" has the misfortune of opening the same month as the fleet adaptation of ""Hellboy"" and the same weekend as the heavenly second installment of ""Kill Bill."" Both feature brutalizing avengers too but they take kernels of violence and make popcorn.""The Punisher"" is merely thrill-less garbage that aspires to franchisehood. (Good luck.) The vengeance holds no catharsis; it provokes no sensation. Death just sits there on screen. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"The Punisher | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review The Punisher Joe Leydon Film Critic joeleydon 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr April 15 2004 | 0415PM PT Second film adaptation of the Marvel Comics franchise about a heavily armed vigilante is a straight-up action-adventure that -- with Tom Jane as the lead and John Travolta as the deadly serious (and deathly dull) bad guy -- fires blanks. Pic plays like a paint-by-numbers pilot for bygone basic-cable teleseries. Theatrical life should be short. Maybe theyll just keep taking their best shots at ""The Punisher"" until they score a hit. Second film adaptation of the Marvel Comics franchise about a heavily armed vigilante is marginally better than the slapdash 1989 edition featuring Dolph Lundgren as the titular antihero. As straight-up action-adventure however this version -- with Tom Jane (""Deep Blue Sea"") as the lead and John Travolta as the deadly serious (and deathly dull) bad guy -- fires blanks. Thoroughly routine pic plays like a paint-by-numbers pilot for bygone basic-cable teleseries. Theatrical life should be short. Although much less widely known to the general public than the Fantastic Four X-Men and other Marvel heavy-hitters the Punisher has attracted a fiercely loyal following since his first ""guest star"" appearance in a February 1974 issue of ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" Eventually spun off in his own comicbook the renegade character was introed early on as Frank Castle much-decorated Marine whose wife and children were killed when the family stumbled upon a gangland execution. After authorities proved unable to convict guilty parties Castle drafted himself to become a full-service dispenser of rough justice. Not unlike makers of the initial ""Punisher"" pic first-time feature helmer Jonathan Hensleigh and co-scripter Michael France take liberties while reconstituting comicbook mythos. In this version Castle (Jane here billed as Tom rather than Thomas as he has been known up to now) is a Florida-based FBI agent who ramrods an ill-fated sting that ends with the inadvertent killing of a would-be arms dealer. Unfortunately the deceased is son of Howard Saint (Travolta) a seemingly respectable Tampa businessman who retains vicious killers and other miscreants while laundering millions for South American drug kingpins. At the urging of Livia (Laura Harring) his even more bloodthirsty wife Saint orders his small army of hit men to invade Castles family reunion celebration in Puerto Rico and kill everything that moves. Resulting slaughter claims Castles flinty father (a fleeting appearance by Roy Scheider) his beloved wife (Samantha Mathis) young son (Marcus Johns) and two or three dozen other unfortunates. But Castle himself survives albeit just barely and returns to Florida to... well to punish the killers. If opening scenes are disappointingly prosaic the rest is depressingly rote and sometimes laughably silly. Unique flavor of the comicbook characters method and motivation has been homogenized in a standard-issue revenge scenario that recalls nothing so much as the straight-to-video vehicles of Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Upon his return to Tampa Castle doesnt even try to maintain a low profile while launching his vendetta. When he isnt zooming around the city in his souped-up GTO or announcing his intentions to local cops and TV camera crews he spends hours alone and unguarded in his decrepit tenement apartment guzzling Wild Turkey and loading his guns while waiting for Saints goons to drop by. A few nasty palookas do indeed show up now and then (pics best sequence has Castle and one bulky adversary literally crashing through walls while fighting). But even though the bad guys know Castles precise whereabouts -- a rockabilly trigger man (Mark Collie) even knows what diner he visits each morning for breakfast -- they never manage to be in the right place at the right time with the right number of bullets to perforate the Punisher. Hensleigh (whose scripting credits include ""Armageddon"" and ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"") tries to humanize Castle by surrounding the remorseless revenger with colorful neighbors -- a sad-eyed waitress (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) a corpulent cook (John Pinette) and body-pierced computer geek (Ben Foster) but theyre not around enough to make much impact. In contrast villains are onscreen too often to little purpose. As Saint Travolta goes through the motions with all the enthusiasm of someone whos fulfilling a commitment after losing a bet. True enough his role is a cliche that -- along with the pics Florida locale -- seems a throwback to ""Miami Vice."" But Travolta does nothing to inject fresh life into bland archetype (baddie in the original was embodied by Jeroen Krabbe). Jane evidences appropriate physicality and brooding gravitas and he looks way-cool in the Punishers trademark skull-adorned T-shirt. Overall however thesp is hampered by the pics oddly and off-puttingly colorless conception of the title character as a generic action hero with big guns and a bad attitude. Production values are unremarkable.

Punisher takes the actor who played Mickey Mantle in 61 and lets him do to bad guys what the Mick did to major-league pitching. Lions Gate Films Thomas Jane is Frank Castle direct from Marvel Comics. And in keeping with the character pumped-up Jane now looks more like a ballplayer on steroids. Diverging from the comic the movie Castle is an FBI man avenging the slaying of his mom dad wife and son a slaughter notably brutal for a film whose primary plus is a sense of humor. That sense of humor is most apparent in Punishers casting of John Travolta as arch-villain Howard Saint a rich underworld maven with two grown sons. At 50 Travolta almost seems too young for the role. A bureau stakeout has contributed to the death of one of his offspring which spurs the retaliatory Castle-clan killings by Saints Tampa-based army of sadists who just miss dispatching Frank. ABOUT THE MOVIE The Punisher    (out of four) Stars Thomas Jane John Travolta Rebecca Romijn-Stamos Will Patton Laura Harring Samantha Mathis Director Jonathan Hensleigh Distributor Lions Gate Rating R for pervasive brutal violence language and brief nudity Opens Friday nationwide Except for this opening carnage in the Puerto Rican outdoors the movie mostly avoids real-world settings. Saint is bunkered in his compound and Castle in a seedy apartment complete with sundry social outcasts down the hall. Some of the ensuing humor comes from having ex-dancer Travolta married to (and insanely possessive of) voluptuous Laura Harring once the star of 1990s Lambada The Forbidden Dance. For a while you think ""Will they get out on the floor?"" But no. Instead the choreographic priorities are reserved for indoor combat making this a banner screen week (see also Kill Bill Vol. 2) for trashing domiciles. This is another movie in which a scalding meal on the stove more determines a fights outcome than severe knife wounds to the torso. I dont want to go to the mat cheering this movie on against naysayers of all creeds yet it does have a comic-book spirit and one of the great final exits for a villain in years. Hour two is better thanks to the casting of Castles new neighbors portly John Pinette face-pierced Ben Foster and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos looking dowdy as the downtrodden Samaritan striving to get Castle off those Wild Turkey breakfasts. Romijn-Stamos smokes wears little makeup dresses drably and is often chained to a sewing machine. Its a nice try and shes touching in the role. But this is the kind of apartment where The Honeymooners Ed Norton is your neighbor. Her presence confirms that this yarn is a fantasy.

"Punisher The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; punisher-the ) Punisher The (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Jonathan Hensleighs directorial debut is the second movie to be based on the Marvel Comics character of The Punisher. The first film released in 1989 stars Dolph Lundgren in the role essayed here by Thomas Jane. The earlier picture is rarely cited as one of the great comic book-to-screen translations and unfortunately the 2004 version doesnt make a noticeable improvement. In recent years a lot of Marvel superheroes have made the leap from printed page to silver screen. None has been given more shoddy treatment than The Punisher. The material isnt inherently bad. This is essentially a revenge story in the grand tradition of Death Wish (although it bears a stronger resemblance to the recent Vin Diesel bomb A Man Apart). The problem is that Hensleigh creates a motion picture with a split personality. The tone evident in the films early scenes is radically divergent from what it morphs into and the union of bleak tragedy camp and mostly-unintentional comedy curdles. Think of what might happen if someone grafted parts of Batman and Robin onto The Crow and youll have an idea of how unpalatable The Punisher is. The film opens by introducing us to Federal agent Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) who is on his last assignment before he retires and takes his wife and child to live in London. Things go wrong and the son of local mob boss Howard Saint (John Travolta) is killed. Saint wants more than an eye for an eye so he sends his enforcer Quentin Glass (Will Patton) and a goon squad to Puerto Rico where the Castle family is holding a reunion. Glass and about a dozen armed men wipe out Castles family including his son wife (Samantha Mathis) and father (Roy Scheider). They believe they have killed Castle as well but its a miscalculation. He returns albeit not quite from the grave to seek vengeance against Glass Saint and Saints wife Livia (Laura Harring). The campy silly elements of the films second half - which include outrageous one-liners (""Gods gonna sit this one out"") and corny visual cues (big moments punctuated by a thunderclap) - would have been more enjoyable if the first 30 minutes werent so depressing and gritty. Once Samantha Mathis Roy Scheider a young kid and a large group of extras are dispatched were supposed to forget about their brutal exit and vicariously enjoy Franks quest for revenge which is played out like a B-movie with an extra helping of cheese. Hansleigh whose previous Hollywood experience is as a script writer (Armageddon) includes as many cues as possible to get 13-year old boys on their feet cheering. (The problem is that at least in theory because of the R-rating 13-year old boys cant see the movie.) Its possible to argue that Hansleigh intended for the movie to be so intentionally dumb that its meant to be funny. But the grim first act argues against that. The filmmakers may be aware that theyre not making high art but they want us to sympathize with Frank and be into his mission of righteous vengeance. Were not. The screenplay is sloppy and overlong and when the last bad guy has been dispatched we feel no satisfaction. The movie pilfers freely from other better films - the Russian bears more than a passing resemblance to From Russia with Loves Red and one of the one-liners is taken directly from Brian DePalmas The Untouchables. In a better movie such cribs might be considered homages; here they sully the source. Thomas Jane appears to be in a quandary about whether to play Frank with a straight intensity or a wink-and-a-nod. He opts for something down the middle which effectively dehumanizes the protagonist. Franks alcoholism is an easily dispatched plot device and his relationship with a downtrodden woman (played by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos sans blue body paint) is little more than an excuse to get a pretty face on the screen. The cast is populated by familiar actors from bygone days. Once Mathis and Scheider would have merited more that glorified cameos. Would that John Travolta had been thus limiteda| The star has been effective as a villain in several previous outings (Face/Off and Swordfish come to mind) but Saint means little more to the actor than a paycheck. He isnt menacing and doesnt represent an imposing adversary. Will Patton who has a knack for playing detestable individuals is far more worthy of our hatred. But the method of his elimination is a cheat. In trying to describe what goes wrong with The Punisher the best illustration may come from Batman. The two cinematic incarnations of the Caped Crusader have been markedly different in tone and intent. The first one starring Adam West was openly silly and embraced its campiness to comedic effect. But theres never any mention of Batmans bleak origins. The Tim Burton version is dark and operatic and dwells on Bruce Waynes sad past. Theres little humor in Burtons Gotham City unless its grim and twisted. Now imagine inserting Wests character into Burtons world and you get a sense of the kind of mismatch that The Punisher offers. Marvel Comics may be intent upon getting every possible character in their superhero stable into a movie but this is one instance when more effort should have been invested in the screenplay. The Punisher isnt Frank Castle; its Jonathan Hensleigh. And the punishee is anyone sitting in the audience.
