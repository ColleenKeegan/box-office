Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores Movie Review Hot Under the White Collar In Fun With Dick amp; Jane Hollywood rediscovers the joy of class warfare. By Logan Hill ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Columbia Pictures) In 2005 a glut of Hollywood dramaslike Munich Syriana The Constant Gardener even War of the Worldsdramatized our shared anxieties about terrorism the military-oil complex Big Pharma and Tom Cruise. But polls suggest that moviegoers are even more worried about issues like Social Security and pensions and by the vague sense that this growing economy isnt. In other words money. Thats something Hollywood wrung its hands about all year if only offscreen. So its a pleasant shock to see the arrival of Fun With Dick amp; Jane a pitch-perfect farce for the post-Enron era. Not only did the movie open right in the middle of the MTA strike but its plot is all about pensions. As a corporate flack whose new-media company Globodyne combusts in scandal Jim Carrey has finally found a role that suits his spastic mania. Maddened by his senseless unemployment he and his wife (the marvelously snarky Tea Leoni) spiral out of control. Almost instantly broke (their pensions were invested in now-worthless Globodyne stock) the two hock their flat-panel TV to pay the nanny. Landscapers have literally repossessed the sod from their well-tended front lawn. And Carrey in an adaptation of Barbara Ehrenreichs minimum-wage expose Nickel and Dimed is forced to take a series of degrading jobsfrom Wal-Mart-ish greeter to illegal day laborerquickly discovering as rapper Kanye West sang about his days as a Gap shop clerk that you cant shine on 6.55. But its not until the night he watches the sprinklers go off on his block that he totally loses it carving jagged patches of turf out of his neighbors yards in a delirious spasm that echoes the manic toaster-stealing of Sam Shepards play True West another story of suburban emasculation. Pleased with their stolen grass and convinced that all that decent Americans who play by the rules stuff is bull the couple reenacts Bonnie and Clyde in the burbsonly with sillier costume changesrobbing yuppie coffee shops to pay for a new pool. And though Dean Parisots film (co-scripted by The 40-Year-Old Virgins Judd Apatow a new force to be reckoned with) is a remake of a 1977 Jane Fonda movie the jokes that hit their marks are pointedly current. Theres even a re-creation of Bushs Now watch this golfing moment in Fahrenheit 9/11 with Dubya doubled by Alec Baldwins Texan-ish Globodyne CEO. It seemed that Hollywood had all but abandoned the long tradition of class-struggle comedies one embraced by nearly every great American comic from Charlie Chaplin to Eddie Murphy. Lately studio comedies have been spoofy remakes or solipsistic satires about media people or unfunnily earnest movies like The Family Stone or Rumor Has It all of which seem to transpire in some Dreamland USA where Wally and the Beav are alive and well and tooling around Pasadena in Range Rovers. Its curious that Dick amp; Jane is such an anomaly because class comedy is booming on TV where shows like Everybody Hates Chris and The Office have put money front and center. And its particularly surprising that Hollywood took so long to send up Kenneth Lay and WorldCom (both are thanked in the end credits) because in the eighties audiences flocked to class-war comedies like Trading Places. If those films punctured the frothy bubbles of Dynasty and Dallas perhaps Fun With Dick amp; Jane and Kanye West and Everybody Hates Chris signal the rumblings of a populist pop backlash against MTV Cribs and Sex and the City. And maybe its a sign of the times that many moviegoers can sympathize with Jim Carreys relatively well-to-do whining in the first place. (I know my health-care premium just went updid yours?) These days its not just Eddie Murphys wise-ass who emerges from the ghetto to tell truth to power; the rich are so much richer that even Carreys soccer dad is howling. Back in the eighties who would have predicted that our newest tramp would be driving a BMW? Fun With Dick amp; Jane Directed by Dean Parisot. Sony. PG-13. Share this story...

His words come to mind here when ruined suburbanite Jane (Tea Leoni) arrives at the same conclusion.There is no more work she declares perhaps coining a new maxim for Bushlandia. A screwball paean to the downsized the outsourced the burn-unit casualties of corporate flame-out this serviceable remake of the 1977 George Segal-Jane Fonda comedy gives go-getter Dick (Jim Carrey) a few halcyon hours as new VP of communications at mega-something Globodyne before the companys Enron-style collapse pulverises his job savings and pension. Dick lines up for a urine test at Cost Mart and a similarly brief stint as a migrant labourer gets him deported while Jane harms herself and others as novice aerobics instructor and cosmetic guinea pig. Soon enough the couple turn to non-corporate crime robbing banks and hatching a convoluted scheme to relieve the unscathed Globodyne honcho (Alec Baldwin) of 400 million. As is often the case even with Jim Carrey films not produced by Jim Carrey Fun with Dick and Jane often becomes Fun with Jim and More Jim which is admittedly fabulous (see Dick flaying I Believe I Can Fly in an elevator or his gloriously reiterative hysteria when faced with indictment) but tends to sideline the gifted comedienne Leoni. At its best though the movie is a borderline cathartic salute to a burgeoning pink-slip subculture of dedicated office drones forced into Starbucks hold-ups cockfight promotion pot cultivation and other twenty-first century variations on subsistence farming.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Fun with Dick and Jane | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fun-with-dick-and-jane ) Fun with Dick and Jane (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Have you ever gone through the painful experience of watching someone who was once good at something try to recapture their past glory? It can be in sports acting writing or any number of vocations. Thats the dubious opportunity Fun with Dick and Jane offers viewers. Jim Carrey tries to turn back the clock and venture into Ace Ventura mode without realizing that hes no longer the comedian he was a dozen years ago. In the interim he has matured to the point where we no longer accept him in this kind of role. (Even Adam Sandler Carreys heir apparent has moved into more serious pictures.) Stranger still the film contains dark undercurrents and elements of melodrama that clash with Carreys attempts to resurrect the zaniness and physicality of his past. Much of the films comedy feels muted; Fun with Dick and Jane isnt a lot of fun. There was a time when Carrey could guarantee a huge opening day box office but Fun with Dick and Jane a re-make of the 1977 film starring George Segal and Jane Fonda is just another disposable end-of-the-year comedy thrown into multiplexes. The backstory has changed from the original. That one was about upwardly mobile yuppies keeping up with the Joneses. This one is about corporate greed and how the collapse of a corporation impacts its loyal employees. If that doesnt sound like funny material to you you have identified the primary problem with Fun with Dick and Jane. The tone is wildly uneven. Its a message movie with a revenge fantasy third act. Try as they might Carrey director Dean Parisot and screenwriters Judd Apatow and Nicholas Stoller cant inject enough worthwhile humor into the mix to keep this enjoyable. This is Enron lite. If you want a lesson about the reverberations of Enrons collapse see Enron The Smartest Guys in the Room. Distilling that real-life tragedy into the basis of a comedy feels a little unseemly. I dont think the filmmakers set out to be insensitive but when a movie like this doesnt work thats how it seems. Carrey is trying to get us to sympathize with the Enron victims but Fun with Dick and Jane never strikes the right balance and its hard to see someone who lost everything in real life enjoying himself/herself while watching this movie. Carrey plays Dick Harper the newly appointed VP of Communications at a mega-corporation thats on its last legs. In the span of a day Dick goes from a man with a bright future to a man without a job. The CEO Jack McCallister (Alec Baldwin) has taken the money and run leaving his CFO Frank Bascom (Richard Jenkins) to take the fall. Thousands of employees like Dick are out of work and have lost their savings and pension. Dicks wife Jane (TA(c)a Leoni) has recently quit her job so the two are unemployed - and late in the year 2000 (when the movie is set) gaining employment is a tough thing. Item-by-item the Harpers sell their possessions until they have nothing left. The utility companies cut them off then the bank decides to foreclose. Desperate times call for desperate measures - and that means turning into two of the most inept outlaws the country has ever seen. But a jolt of reality convinces Dick to go after the big fish and play Robin Hood with Jack McCallisters ill-gotten profits. Carreys antics give the appearance of someone out of practice trying too hard. Theyre more awkward than funny. His bodys not as plastic at age 43 as it was at age 32. TA(c)a Leoni is okay as Dicks wife but the two share no chemistry. One gets the sense that shes supposed to be Carreys ""straight man"" but they never connect in a way that allows this to work. Maybe thats why so many of the jokes seem ""off."" In striving for inspiration Fun with Dick and Jane discovers moments of cleverness but there arent enough of them nor are they sustained. The movies first third is its strongest. Once Dick loses his job the film enters a prolonged death spiral. Watching Dick and Janes social status disintegrate is more sad than amusing and the final act (a sit-com style caper) belongs in a different movie. The funniest scene during the final 60 minutes involves Dick ""sticking up"" an acquaintance. Its worth a giggle or two - if its comedic impact hasnt been killed by its prominence in trailers and TV ads. But isnt that always the case - the best scenes are used for advertising? And in a case like Fun with Dick and Jane that doesnt leave much for viewers who pay to see the movie.

With Jim Carrey Tea Leoni. (90 min.)This update of the 1977 George Segal-Jane Fonda comedy stars Jim Carrey as an executive at an Enron-style company who faced with bankruptcy goes on a crime spree with his peppy wife played by Tea Leoni. Most of it plays out as sub-medium-grade farce but Carrey has some funny calisthenic bits where he appears to have the pliability of a rubber toy. Director Dean Parisot who made the hilarious sci-fi spoof ""Galaxy Quest"" ladles on too much socially conscious sauce. In what is basically an airhead romp he goes in for way too much nudging about Bush-era corporate malfeasance. Even Ralph Nader makes an appearance Grade C+The White Countess (PG-13)Director James Ivory. With Ralph Fiennes Natasha Richardson. (138 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? At the disquieting center of the beautifully shot but somewhat stolid Merchant Ivory film ""The White Countess"" is Todd Jackson (Ralph Fiennes) a blind and disillusioned American diplomat who fulfills his fantasy of owning a nightclub in 1930s Shanghai. Natasha Richardson plays Russian emigre Countess Sofia who is hired by Jackson to be his hostess even though he knows she moonlights as a prostitute to support her family. Vanessa Redgrave Richardsons real-life mother plays Sofias aunt and her real-life aunt Lynn Redgrave plays her mother-in-law making this movie something of a family affair. But Fienness performance tricky and impassioned is the showpiece. Grade B Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Still in ReleaseThe Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe (PG)Director Andrew Adamson. With Tilda Swinton Jim Broadbent. (140 min.)Adamson the director of ""Shrek"" has done a highly creditable job of visualizing the first of Lewiss seven books about four children in the mythical land of Narnia where the animals talk. The film works well both as a boisterous fantasia and as the Christian fable that Lewis intended. Beneath all the special effects (many of which for a change are actually special) you can detect something cherishably human. Grade A-King Kong (PG-13)Director Peter Jackson. With Jack Black Naomi Watts Adrien Brody. (187 min.)Ann Darrow a struggling actress is picked by Carl Denham to star in his jungle epic on Skull Island rife with dinosaurs (and high on the yech factor). Ultimately she finds herself literally in the palm of the giant apes hands and director Jackson wants us to feel their love. After a while though Jacksons grand-scale ghoulishness becomes numbing.

"In the End You Can Have Fun With Dick and Jane washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies In the End You Can Have Fun With Dick and Jane Jim Carrey goes over the top -- surprise -- in the remake of the 70s movie but Tea Leonis controlled performance helps keep a light comedy likable. (By Ralph Nelson -- Columbia Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday December 21 2005 ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" first came out in 1977 and starred Jane Fonda and George Segal in what would become a sort of 70s period piece a comedy saturated in the look and particular anxieties of its era. The remake which stars Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni as an overextended upwardly mobile California couple has continued in that tradition and for the first hour it captures with breezy humor and quick goofy vignettes the angst of the upper-middle manager at the turn of the 21st century. Dick and Jane Harper live in a suburban cul-de-sac amid identical houses with swimming pools and flat-screen TVs. Theyre McMansion millionaires with their assets tied up in an overpriced underbuilt house and a fat pension plan with Dicks company an amorphous global consortium called Globodyne. Dick is Globodynes brand-new vice president of communications and his first task is to be a guest on a Lou Dobbs-like cable financial show. As hes fielding questions from the host and getting ambushed by Ralph Nader (who plays himself as only he can) the ticker across the screen announces the falling price of Globodynes stock the departure of its CEO and its final crash and burn. Its a cleverly choreographed scene of corporate death by news crawl. (And in one of many note-perfect nods to the movies time period Dicks flameout on national television becomes the subject of a Jib Jab video.) Meanwhile Jane has decided to quit her job as a travel agent so by the close of business on Dicks first day as VP theyre both unemployed. It takes a few months -- of Dick looking for work alongside other desperate white-collar refugees and finally becoming a greeter at a Wal-Mart-type superstore of Jane trying to be an exercise instructor and then a cosmetics test subject of their lawn being repossessed -- before Dick hits on the idea of stealing. While hes trying on sunglasses and explaining his plan to Jane she makes a suggestion through disastrously over-Botoxed lips ""Maybe you should steal some Prozac."" From its trailer and marketing campaign ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" looks like one of those instant forgettables that a studio plops into theaters in the middle of the busy season with hopes that they will disappear quietly. But it turns out to be better than that especially during the run-up to Dick and Janes crime spree when the movie clicks along with giddy contagious good humor. (Theres a particularly hilarious running gag involving Dick and Janes son Billy who speaks with a Spanish accent courtesy of his ever-present nanny and screams ""Dont take my Telemundo"" when his parents sell the TV.) True theres a surfeit of scenes in which Carrey mugs and japes shamelessly for the camera one of the dangers of a movies star also being a producer. Indeed there are moments in ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" which was co-written by Judd Apatow when it seems to be a better vehicle for the more understated style of Steve Carell the star of Apatows ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" But for the most part ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" is a no-brainer with a brain the sort of light inoffensive comedy thats ideal for those days when you want to do your tough sledding outside the theater. (Its modest charms seem to have been calibrated to the last sight gag to soothe and amuse frazzled mall shoppers.) Leoni who proved to be such a comic gem in ""Spanglish"" here does yeoman work as Carreys straight person toning down her neurotic-blonde persona and being a good sport in everything from those painfully swollen prosthetic lips to a Hillary Clinton mask. Dick and Jane also impersonate Sonny and Cher and the Blues Brothers as they gain confidence in the crime world going from sticking up coffee shops and sushi joints to masterminding sophisticated heists at bigger and bigger banks. But most of the humor in ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" derives less from the capers themselves than from the setup and its time frame of the year 2000 when Bush was still running against Gore and no one had yet heard of Ken Lay Bernie Ebbers or Richard Scrushy. (Who along with their corporate companions are conspicuously thanked in the movies closing credits.) Dicks Globodyne boss played with a hearty good-ol-boy twinkle by Alec Baldwin is such an on-the-nose evocation of Lay that the movies final punch line is an anticlimax. Still the title characters last heist brings with it a sense of Robin Hood satisfaction and its clear that even as an instant forgettable ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" has lived up to its title Its fun and thats fine. Fun With Dick and Jane (90 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for brief profanity sexual humor and occasional humorous drug references.

Starring Jim Carrey Tea Leoni and Alec Baldwin. Directed by Dean Parisot. (PG-13. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The 1977 comedy ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" has returned 28 years later in a new incarnation as a commentary on corporate greed. Starring Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni the new films social message comes through loud and clear but something in the comedy seems constrained -- effortful yet muffled. It might be a matter of the right tone never having been found. It might be that the films serious issues makes its frivolity harder to embrace. Or it might be something simple The social angle aside no one had a compelling artistic reason or motivation to remake this picture. Still it has Carrey and it has Leoni and it has Alec Baldwin playing a corporate scoundrel and everyone in it is breaking a sweat trying to be funny. ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" ropes in a fair (not good but fair) number of laughs and along the way makes some perceptive observations about how Americans live today. But its a film in conflict with itself a critique of greed thats suffused with materialism a movie about evil rich people that presents falling out of the upper middle class as the ultimate nightmare. The ambition seems to have been to position the film as a morality tale. Carrey plays Dick a mindless guy with a mindless lifestyle doing mindless work for some multinational corporation. He gets promoted to communications director and is dancing in the street. But within days the business implodes The stock collapses top executives are under indictment and the chief executive (Baldwin) a good ol boy with a Southern accent walks away with 400 million in profits. The movie is at its most interesting at this stage. As he looks for work Dick tries to maintain a breezy confident winners attitude. A generation ago ""positive thinking"" was an emerging strategy. Today its the only mode for business discourse virtually a religion. Look at movies from 50 years ago in which men (always men) applied for work in the corporate world. Back then the myth was that by becoming a cog in the machine one was making a contribution to society doing something patriotic maybe even fighting communism. Today its all about inflating the self becoming bigger and achieving victory. Carrey does this well He plays a man who feels like a loser but is determined to imitate a winner even to himself. His scenes with his bosses in which he tries to share in the banter as an equal are funny because theyre so well acted -- and pathetic. Poor Dicks fears hopes and delusions are there in Carreys eyes. When he takes a grape from a plate at his boss house during a breakfast its a calculated move a risk taken. Dick thinks hes disguising his discomfort and essential powerlessness but both are as obvious as a billboard. Obviously for this to be the morality tale that the filmmakers intend Dick has some serious ground to travel as a man. For this journey to be completely realized and satisfying to an audience the movie cant ultimately be about the fluctuations in Dicks economic circumstances but rather about the transformation of Dicks consciousness. The setup demands or at least leads one to expect an awakening of Dicks value system but thats not the direction of the movie. The movie instead follows the farcical course of the earlier ""Dick and Jane"" even though in this version the film isnt a farce. Dick and Jane start pulling petty robberies to keep from losing their home and then start pulling bigger ones. This is where the film becomes labored and even a little disturbing. The desperation isnt made real and yet their robberies are all too real. Its in this weird zone not weird enough for drama not wild enough for comedy and only Carreys moment-by-moment zaniness squeaks out any laughs at all. -- Advisory This film contains strong language.

Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killing - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sentence Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killingJuly 10 2009|By Sarah Lundy and Amy L. Edwards Sentinel Staff WritersA judge sentenced a 22-year-old Orange County man to life in prison without parole Thursday in a 2006 fatal shooting during a drug deal gone wrong.Deangelo Conner was convicted last month of first-degree murder armed robbery and two counts of robbery with a firearm.Florida law required Circuit Judge Bob Wattles to sentence Conner to life in prison for the murder conviction.Conner had turned down a 25-year plea offer and took his chances at trial.His first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors were heard discussing the case before it was allowed.Authorities say Conner shot Ricardo Rivera 41 once in the chest July 6 2006.Conner and two others initially set up the meeting as a drug buy but they never intended to pay for anything the prosecution said; the three planned to grab the drugs and run.At one point Conner pulled out a gun and fired at Rivera. Conner told investigators that Rivera was charging toward him and he was merely protecting himself.The jury didnt buy it.Several of Ricardo Riveras relatives attended the sentencing including his children and brother Robert Rivera who read statements from several people.In a statement Ricardo Riveras ex-wife wrote that the hardest thing she has had to do was tell her children they no longer had a father.The woman wrote that her familys hurt will never go away.

They were the characters who ran jumped and started many a kid reading. Some of you may recall Dick and Jane all grown-up and married in the primer-to-screen comedy ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" (1977). That lark (more interesting as sociological artifact than laugh riot) starred George Segal as aerospace engineer Dick and Jane Fonda as wife Jane. When Dicks company cans him he and Jane begin making ends meet with the pettiest of crimes before graduating to stick-up jobs and safecracking. Nearly 30 years have passed since middle-class Dick and Jane faced unexpected downsizing. Now theyve returned in a just-as-slight retread starring Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni. Dick and Jane Harper reside in a housing development meant to resemble any number of soulless treeless suburbs. Dick drives a company Beamer and suffers the morning jibes of his competitive neighbor. Jane deals with furious customers at a travel agency. Son Billy spends enough time with housekeeper Blanca to speak Spanish as his first language. And Spot - well hes a terrier mix very light on spots. As the ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" begins affable company man Dick is summoned to the highest floor of Globodyne. There he meets with the chief financial officer. CEO Jack McCallister (Alec Baldwin) is nowhere in sight. Congrats Dick is told. He is now VP of communications. See Dick count his chickens. See Jane quit her job. Uh-oh Dick. On no Jane. Dicks rise coincides with Globodynes plummet. While Dick stammers to spin the companys outlook on a financial news show the big bosses make certain files get shredded company helicopters buzz away and golden parachutes open. Intended to echo headlines about Enron WorldCom Adelphia ad nauseam ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" isnt clever enough to pull off the kind of biting satire so much plenty and plunder begs for. Instead the movie - directed by Dean Parisot and written by Judd Apatow and Nicholas Stoller - displays a similar cultural disconnect other titans of industry have with the working class. As pleasant as Dick and Jane are - and they are much sweeter company than their 1977 counterparts - this movie displays mild contempt for the very people who work hardest for the least amount of money. When Dick tries to get a job at KostMart its not Wal-Marts body-double that gets the ribbing its the employees and customers. When Dick tries to get hired as a day laborer again its not the system that takes the brunt of the joke. Before exacting its predictable payback the movie offers a parable about how the mighty have fallen or at least a mid-level worker bee. But the movie squanders Jane and Dicks lessons in economic empathy. You may find laughs. Some slapstick about Jane toiling as a cosmetics guinea pig is hard to resist. Laughing however is not the same as amusement. Early on we get an inkling about what kind of Jim Carrey movie this will be. As the opening credits crawl Dick finds himself alone in the elevator on the way up to his promotion. A Muzak version of R. Kellys ""I Can Believe I Can Fly"" plays. Soon Dick is shouting the words and dancing sort of. Its funny enough. Then Carrey goes on and on. And just in case you dont get the joke his producer credit comes up. So here is a revised primer See Jim Carrey ham it up. See Tea Leoni have appealing fun with scant material. See studio execs digging into their vault for old material. See ... oh why not just wait for the DVD.

"Desperate pleasure - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Desperate pleasure Jim Carrey Tea Leoni are brilliant as partners in crime in a satiric remake of the 1977 film By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  December 21 2005 Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni play Dick and Jane Harper one of those supersuccessful suburban couples for whom theres nowhere to go but up up up. Until of course their luck runs out.After Dick loses his long-awaited vice president job in a corporate corruption scandal (he was just a patsy) the Harpers make a fast hilarious skid into poverty.Dick has to trade in his new BMW for a beat-up Ford their meals come from soup kitchens and the housekeeper has to be paid with their new appliances. When their only child catches mom and dad hauling away the plasma screen television he wails the way kids do for a dead pet.The joke is not that the Harpers are poor. Its that they handle their indigence ridiculously The sight of the family being reduced to bathing via oscillating lawn sprinkler is one of several very funny humiliations. And there is even lower for them to go.Facing foreclosure on their McMansion Dick and Jane let go of their remaining shreds of civility and turn larcenous. They rob banks coffee shops and car dealerships always in disguise (once outrageously as a gender-reversed Sonny and Cher) until the TVs are back and their brown lawn is green again.But Dick and Jane are dismayed to discover that Dicks former co-workers have become just as desperate in their joblessness -- cockfighting rings and pot harvesting Plus Dick is facing indictment. So he aims his rebellion at the riches of his old boss played by Alec Baldwin with a Colonel Sanders accent.Writers Nicholas Stoller and Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") have refashioned Dick and Jane"" from the 1977 George Segal-Jane Fonda vehicle that riffed on Bonnie and Clyde."" Their remake is more devilish hitting its targets with the reckless glee required for a round of Whac-A-Mole.The setting is California in 2000 at the start of a wave of corporate scandals and the movie plugs into the popular intolerance cynicism and ambivalence toward the worlds megacompanies We cant live with em but . . .The film however doesnt collapse under the weight of its righteousness. As satires go this is a drive-by shooting that tickles. Director Dean Parisot has directed episodes of Monk"" and that short-lived gem Bakersfield P.D."" as well as the sci-fi spoof Galaxy Quest."" For Dick and Jane"" his touch is light and his pacing is speedy without turning slick.I only wished the movie slowed down to appreciate the good actors who turn up in microscopic parts including Stacey Travis Laurie Metcalf and John Michael Higgins. (Ralph Nader has a cameo too and theres a fine lampoon of Lou Dobbs.) The underappreciated Richard Jenkins does find time to pocket a few scenes. He plays a senior corporate crook whos now the spineless drunk helping Dick and Jane get revenge on Baldwin.Jenkins is his usual great self and Carrey and Leoni are theirs too. Hes rubber. Shes Teflon. Watch him slide off her nerves. Its good to see Leoni purely enjoying herself after the impossible stress of Spanglish."" She gets to be a comedian again not a punching bag.And Carreys previous forays into seriousness have given ballast to his lunatic physicality. Now when his body breaks down his heart appears to follow. In one scene Dick having suffered his last indignity watches Jane sleep in peace. His face is covered in dirt. His eyes have welled up with tears. And he gives a speech about being fed up with living this way.A few years ago this moment would have been Carrey mugging in another throwaway comedy. Now hes Henry Fonda in The Grapes of Wrath."" Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Jim Carrey and Tea Leonis Dick and Jane turn to crime to make ends meet in Fun with Dick and Jane. Columbia Pictures Fun with Dick and Jane ( ) has occasional moments of amusement but mostly its a poor use of talented lead actors Tea Leoni and Jim Carrey. The details surrounding the premise have been updated from the 1977 original starring Jane Fonda and George Segal but its still a story of a middle-class suburban couple who turn to crime when the husband loses his job. Carrey plays a cheerful guy who gets a promotion to director of communications for a huge corporation but his dream job turns sour when he finds out the company is going under thanks to the thievery of its CEO (a wan Alec Baldwin). With hit-you-over-the-head echoes of Enron and other corporate meltdowns employees are left without severance pay and retirement funds. Everything goes in the fat pockets of the CEO. Baldwin by the way has become the go-to guy for slimy corporate roles. Earlier this year he played a thinly disguised version of Nike chairman Phil Knight in Elizabethtown. Leoni revealed a lot of promise in 1996s low-budget road comedy Flirting with Disaster. We know shes a gifted comic but her latest roles have kept her from realizing her potential. Remember her wince-inducing yuppie mom in Spanglish? In Dick and Jane theres a running gag about the couples young son speaking broken English thanks to being raised by a Spanish-speaking nanny. Its marginally funny but the joke becomes tiring. Those sequences combined with scenes of hard-luck Carrey joining immigrant day laborers to find work border on being offensive and racist. Surely that was not the intention. The movies closing dedication to corporate scandals including Enron Tyco Adelphia and WorldCom is funny. Too bad the film itself isnt as clever. (Opens nationwide Wednesday. PG-13 for brief language some sexual humor and occasional humorous drug references. Running time 1 hour 30 minutes.)

Breezy uneven update of the 1977 George Segal-Jane Fonda vehicle is the rare Hollywood remake that by daring to reinterpret its source material within a fresh political context actually has a reason to exist. A screwball heist comedy for the Enron era the new ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" gives the finger to scandal-ridden big businesses everywhere. Breezy uneven update of the 1977 George Segal-Jane Fonda vehicle is the rare Hollywood remake that by daring to reinterpret its source material within a fresh political context actually has a reason to exist; the results if not exactly subtle are still fun enough to fend off any charges of titular false advertising. Fans of Jim Carrey in full-on manic mode should help Sony bank some B.O. during a competitive holiday frame. Some might argue that by lambasting the giant corporations whose politically entrenched top dogs and fraudulent accounting practices have wreaked havoc on the American economy in recent years pic is basically shooting fish in a barrel. True enough but when the fish are this rotten why complain? Pointedly setting their story in the year 2000 pre-Enron scribes Judd Apatow and Nicholas Stoller (who previously collaborated on TVs short-lived ""Undeclared"") imagine a cartoonishly exaggerated version of the doomed corporate behemoth in Globodyne a company specializing in ""fiber-optic content provision"" among other things. In the original it took five minutes for aerospace engineer Dick Harper to get fired. Here it takes almost half an hour for an entire company to go under taking Dick (played by Carrey who produced with Brian Grazer) with it. Within hours of being promoted to a top communications post Dick is brought on TV to announce the companys earnings and explain why chief executive Jack McCallister (Alec Baldwin) has abruptly dumped his shares of Globodyne stock. After an amusing scene of frantic document-shredding during which the companys No. 2 (an effective Richard Jenkins) goes on a boozy expository rant about Globodynes cooked books Dick breaks the news to his wife Jane (Tea Leoni) who as luck would have it has just quit her job. With both spouses out of work a son (Aaron Michael Drozin) to feed and a pile of ever-rising debt its not long before theyre forced to sell off the Beemer and the plasma TV while the rest of their beautiful suburban abode is stripped bare. While some scenes are lifted straight from the original (i.e. contractors showing up to repossess the lawn) the script adds another satirical layer by playfully sending up Dick Jane and the greedy consumerist culture that produced them -- evident from the cookie-cutter houses lining their street as well as the neighbor who owns a voice-operated Mercedes. Pic also has fun with Dicks vain attempts to find a job amid cutthroat competition which end with him working as a greeter at a Costco-like retailer. But the crux of the story -- the fun if you will -- is that Dick and Jane end up going the way of Bonnie and Clyde staging a few clumsy convenience-store robberies before perfecting their methods and moving on to bigger fish. Pic essentially becomes a parade of costumes at this point which is fine as both Carrey and Leoni are adept at physical comedy and perfectly comfortable donning all manner of ridiculous outfits from one holdup to the next. While Segal played Dick as an affable bumbler Carrey imbues him with an anarchic irrepressibly show-offy streak from the start which makes the characters criminal progression both logical and weirdly sympathetic. Still thesp is more or less playing himself here and mileage will vary accordingly. Leoni however is smooth and winning in a perf that ideally complements and sometimes even trumps Carreys shenanigans. Baldwin is commandingly corrupt as the sleazy ex-CEO who becomes Dick and Janes final target hammering home the message that for sheer evil petty theft has nothing on white-collar crime. Helmer Dean Parisot (""Galaxy Quest"") juggles the various genre elements with a light but supple touch; even when the jokes dont work pic never overstays its welcome clocking in at five minutes shorter than the original. Impudent political humor reaches its arguable nadir during the end credits which extend a special thank-you to top executives from the likes of Enron Worldcom Arthur Andersen Adelphia Cendant and too many others.
