Slacker Zack (Dane Cook) carries boxes in a superstore where cashier Vince (Dax Shepard) is the only guy who bothers to try for the Employee Of The Month title. When Amy (Jessica Simpson) arrives all that changes and Zack goes for the title in a bid to impress her. And so the two rivals go head to head in some moderately amusing scenes racing to answer customer calls and get a nod of approval from their watchful boss. The characters seem inconsistent though one minute Vince is a slick ladies man the next hes a socially clueless figure of fun. Zack seems bright and inherently ambitious and the explanation for his under-achievement is supplied too late. Amy is little more than a pretty face undermining the films female appeal and leading one to wonder if Dukes of Hazzard eye candy Simpson is becoming a trifle typecast. Her next film? Blonde Ambition a workplace romantic comedy.

Comments Employee of the Month Dane Cook and Dax Shepard are superstore grunts who compete for the title honor on the shaky theory that it will get the winner into bed with new coworker Jessica Simpson. Theres a great Office Space-style satire to be made about big-box stores screwing their working-poor employees but Hollywood studios covet DVD rack space at those same stores so instead were supposed to get excited about which of these two idiots earns more gold stars. Greg Coolidge directed; with Andy Dick and Efren Ramirez (the affectless Pedro from Napoleon Dynamite). PG-13 103 min. By J.R.

Johnny Knoxville does it but Dane Cook as a lowly box boy at a superstore stirs up trouble with genial indifference. Hes a rebel of passivity. Theres a crumb of an idea to setting a movie at a mega-mart that makes the Office Space cubicles look like executive suites but the results in Employee of the Month are toothless. As a villainous cashier Dax Shepard mugs with such vitality that its hard not to root for him. Memo to Jessica Simpson You look peachy but stop beaming about it.

"Employee of the Month Give the Blonde a Pink Slip washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Employee of the Month Give the Blonde a Pink Slip Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 6 2006 The 40s had Carole Lombard. The 50s had Judy Holliday. The 60s had Doris Day. The 70s had Goldie Hawn. Each generation it seems is blessed with a blond actress with eye-popping physical assets who also happens to possess warmth goofy accessibility and superior comic timing. As ""Employee of the Month"" helps prove this generation is lucky enough to have its own beloved dizzy dazzling blonde. Her name is Cameron Diaz. Her name is emphatically not Jessica Simpson the putative star of this laugh-free mash-up of ""Office Space"" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and the NBC series ""The Office."" Considering who stars in the latter two vehicles it bears noting that college comedy circuit star Dane Cook is no Steve Carell either. Simpson and Cook star as two service workers at a big-box store somewhere in the American Southwest; when Simpsons character arrives for her first day at work rumor quickly spreads that she only sleeps with guys who qualify as you got it employee of the month. Cooks character a box boy quickly rises to the occasion trying to outdo his closest competitor a smirking brown-noser named Vince (Dax Shepard) who has a cult following of customers and his own lackey (Efren Ramirez playing the same deadpan second banana he did as Pedro in ""Napoleon Dynamite""). Were supposed to root for Cooks slacker because he rides a minibike and shops at a natural foods store while all those around him super-size. Rarely has an actress exuded such blank nothingness as Simpson a one-woman vapid delivery system who sucks the energy and joy out of every scene shes in like some freakishly well-endowed black hole. Cook is no better in a movie that has nothing to recommend it unless you count a nearsighted optician played by Andy Dick who ekes a modicum of slapstick comedy out of his role. All else is dross in a film that shamelessly steals from earlier better versions of itself right down to Jim and Pams ""jinx"" episode of ""The Office."" Shame shame shame and lame lame lame. Employee of the Month (103 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor and profanity.

Jessica Simpson is mere window dressing while standup comic Dane Cook is passably charming in ""Employee of the Month."" If a group of people got together and said ""Lets make a movie kind of like Office Space except nowhere near as funny"" the result just might be something like ""Employee of the Month"" a flat workplace comedy set at a warehouse store. Vince (Dax Shepard) has been employee of the month for 17 months running and if he wins another month hell set an all-time record -- but not if slacker Zack (Dane Cook) his rival for the attention of pretty cashier Amy (Jessica Simpson) can stop him. This isnt exactly knee-slapping stuff but then again ""Office Space"" probably didnt sound all that good on paper either. The problem here is a screenplay (credited to three writers including director Greg Coolidge) that lines up all its characters then doesnt know what to do with them. So time is frittered away with homophobic jokes and fat jokes and baseball games and grannies talking dirty and when the movies over youll be hard-pressed to remember exactly what it was all about. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""Employee of the Month"" with Dane Cook Jessica Simpson Dax Shepard Andy Dick. Directed by Greg Coolidge from a screenplay by Don Calame Chris Conroy and Coolidge. 103 minutes. Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor and language. Several theaters. And the films three leads seem to be acting in different movies. Cook is the most successful; hes got an amused ease on screen and at least seems to be enjoying himself. Shepard gives a highly stylized performance that might work in television sketch comedy but next to the relaxed Cook he just seems a touch insane. And Simpson doesnt act at all. Luckily the costume department has figured out that by putting her in a series of very low-cut tops attention can be diverted from her expressionless face. The effect isnt exactly subtle Her breasts appear to be trying to escape from the movie perhaps in search of a better one. There are a few clever bits here and there (the store manager is named Glen Gary while his corporate-head brother is named Glen Ross) and you get a sense that Cook known for standup comedy would be pretty funny in a movie with a decent screenplay. But ""Employee of the Month"" which finds its comedic apex in watching cashiers scanning purchases is disposable filmmaking with its shelf life already up.

Photo courtesy of Lionsgate Films Dane Cook (from left) Tim Bagley and Dax Shepard in ""Employee of the Month."" Photo courtesy of Lionsgate Films Clerks compete for Jessica Simpson for some reason 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Employee of the Month Comedy. Starring Dane Cook Jessica Simpson and Dax Shepard. Directed by Greg Coolidge. (PG-13. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In the mildly amusing ""Employee of the Month"" Jessica Simpson stars as a cashier at the Super Club a Wal-Mart-type discount emporium. But in her low-cut tops revealing ample cleavage she looks more like a waitress at Hooters. Her ensembles give new meaning to the marketing concept of displaying merchandise. The movie itself is an example of a new marketing trend Throw together several attractive young people whose acting skills are marginal but who are familiar to a target audience -- in this case teens and those scarcely out of adolescence -- and call it a cast. Simpson is a pop music icon and perennial boldface name in gossip columns. As Amy the cashier she doesnt know where to look revealing her inexperience in front of a movie camera. A few times she stares right into it with the panicked expression of someone whos just discovered shes on ""Candid Camera."" Her co-stars Dane Cook and Dax Shepard fare somewhat better as Zack and Vince fierce competitors for Super Clubs highest accolade from which the film takes its title. Cooks extensive experience doing stand-up pays off. His Zack has the funniest moments first seething at Vinces success -- hes been the top employee 17 months in a row and will win a ""newish"" Chevy Malibu if he makes it 18 -- and then deciding to take him on. The pomposity that Shepard a graduate of MTVs ""Punkd"" brings to Vince is humorous in an absurdist kind of way. He flashes his access card to the cashiers lounge as if it gained him entree to a posh private club. Inevitably the two alpha males wind up competing for Amys affections. A transfer from another store branch shes rumored to grant her sexual favors only to the employee of the month. Each time Vince mentions Zack to her he manages to work in that his competitor has yet to advance from box boy the absolute bottom of the food chain. Meanwhile Vince is head cashier on his way to becoming a manager. Thats not only the setup of ""Employee of the Month"" its pretty much the entire story. By day Vince and Zack race around the store looking for good deeds to do; by night they attempt to woo Amy. Upon learning that Zack and Amy instinctively finish each others sentences Vince attempts to second-guess what shes about to say with disastrous results. When she says ""Im going off to"" he quickly adds ""take a dump."" Jokes about bodily functions abound as is increasingly the case in movies aimed at teenage audiences. Does anyone past the age of 6 find this stuff funny? The outcome is as predictable as everything else in ""Employee of the Month."" Zack is so obviously the good guy who cares about his friends and loves his grandmother while Vinces selfishness is apparent to everyone except his bosses. It would have been a far more interesting movie if their personalities had been evenly matched and it wasnt telegraphed whom you were to root for. But Greg Coolidge -- directing his first feature film after writing the screenplay for ""Sorority Boys"" and several other sophomoric comedies -- keeps ""Employee"" zipping along with the speed of Zack on his roller skates stocking the shelves. By the end everybody has learned a moral lesson or two. This will never be the movie of the month but you could do a lot worse at the multiplex. -- Advisory Language and mild sexual situations.

Super Clubs Zack (Dane Cook) offers new cashier Amy (Jessica Simpson) some help at the check-out counter in Employee of the Month. Photo Courtesy Photo Employee of the Month 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Everyone knows big-box stores are a laugh riot. Just shopping in one is a kick in the pants (who doesnt love a fruitless search for ankle socks?) but working there must beat all for hilarity. The fluorescent lighting. The low pay. The bosses and long lines of impatient irate customers. If anyone could find the humor in bulk-discount shopping its Dane Cook that scruffy proletarian monologuist whose stand-up routines have generated a huge following on the Web. Smartly coarsely hilariously he spins comic gold from such mundane setups as cutting in line or asking for ketchup at Burger King. Surely he of all people could spark a few laughs in Employee of the Month. Surely theres a subversive comedy in there somewhere a Sams-Club variation on the screw-this white-collar satire of Office Space. On the other hand maybe Employee of the Month isnt a satire. Maybe its message is corporate all the way Work hard take pride in your job and try not to think dirty thoughts about that piping-hot blonde at checkout because once shes on to your game its over. What sounds reasonable as a human-resources orientation spiel doesnt fare so well as comedy and neither does this limp little film from first-time director Greg Coolidge. Employee of the Month tells the story of Zack (Cook) an uncombed and unmotivated box boy in a discount store that goes by the name of Super Club. Zacks natural rival is Vince (a bottle-blond Dax Shepard) the stores head cashier and chief managerial suck-up. For 17 consecutive months Vince has been named Employee of the Month for which honor his defaced mug hangs framed in the employee locker room. If Vince wins 18 months straight hell set a new company record and take home in the words of his excitable boss (Tim Bagley) ""a brand-newish 2005 Chevy Malibu."" Another implied reward is Super Clubs bodacious new cashier Amy (Jessica Simpson) a transfer whose human-resources file suggests a pronounced affinity for Employee-of-the-Monthers. This revelation spurs Vince and Zack into action Vince assisted in his quest by a doting sidekick (Napoleon Dynamites Efren Ramirez) Zack by a bunch of downtrodden friends (Brian George Harland Williams and in Coke-bottle glasses Andy Dick). In ensuing scenes Cook skates around on wheeled shoes Shepard juggles merchandise and Simpson grins blandly into space while men regard her cleavage. The film cracks a few jokes about class divisions inside Super Club -- cashiers get their own lounge with beverages -- but lest anyone mistake this for a Marxist tract there are additional riffs on Mexicans Puerto Ricans fat people and the developmentally disabled. Every now and then the movie does something genuinely witty like naming the boss ""Glen Gary"" and his brother ""Glen Ross"" then casting the small ferocious Danny Woodburn as the latter -- a corporate shark in the David Mamet mold. By forcing Bagley to quake in fear before ""big brother"" Woodburn empowers one constituency (little people) and entertains another (audiences) however briefly. I was grateful for these scenes because the rest of the film felt like standing in line with a cart full of toilet paper. And I never did find the ankle socks. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals The Mel Brooks Collection on Blu-ray for 25 + pickup at Best Buy GNC Mega Men Sport 90-Count Multivitamins for 9 + free shipping SanDisk 128GB Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive for 20 + pickup at...

Pic will scan reasonably good biz at theatrical checkout stands. Corrections were made to this review on Oct. 2 2006. The slackers take on the brown-nosers in ""Employee of the Month"" a spoof of consumerism and competition thats slightly smarter than might be expected for a pic aimed at the Jessica Simpson demographic. Co-writer-director Greg Coolidges hyphenate debut displays the influence of Mike Judges ""Office Space"" on the 90s generation including that pics deadpan skewering of soulless corporate life. But ""Employee"" shifts the arena from the office to a Costco-like superstore. Falling short of being truly memorable but sharper than the general slagheap of comedies pic will scan reasonably good biz at theatrical checkout stands. At a New Mexico-based branch of the Super Club membership store longtime box boy Zack (standup comic Dane Cook) is inspired by hot new clerk Amy (Simpson) to compete for the title of ""employee of the month"" which Vince (Dax Shepard) has won 17 straight times. Normally languid Zack couldnt care less what Vince does let alone what management thinks. But hearing that Amy sleeps with any guy who wins the monthly award -- and despising goody-good Vince -- spurs Zack to go mano-a-mano with the ace checkout clerk known as ""the fastest hands in the Southwest."" Baseball fans (who will be tickled by an amusing third-act sequence) might think of the Vince-Zack contest as the Yankees vs. a perennial basement-dweller like the Pirates and so its not surprising that Vince immediately racks up the daily gold stars. Coolidge cinematographer Anthony B. Richmond and particularly production designer Jon Gary Steele appear to enjoy using the stores cavernous space and its huge web of aisles as an absurdly overgrown stage. Beyond its physically realistic depiction of shopping culture run amok ""Employee of the Month"" is most enjoyable in its many asides. These include Vince habitually using bagboy and loyal sycophant Jorge (Efren Ramirez) as his key ally in the contest and store boss Glen Gary (Tim Bagley) shuddering when he learns his brutish brother named -- in a cheeky nod to David Mamet -- Glen Ross (Danny Woodburn) is paying a visitfrom Super Clubs corporate offices. Pics midsection with the increasingly likable Zack threatening to overcome Vinces early lead is unexpectedly funny and involving. Last section is much less so mainly because Coolidges script (co-written with Don Calame and Chris Conroy) appears duty-bound to obey every rule of conventional comedy plotting down to the heros seeming defeat and last-minute reprieve. This is where the movie seems to lose its bearings as a genuine post-""Office Space"" American comedy and turns into just another formulaic laffer albeit with a slightly more caustic edge than most. Camaraderie in cast is a key to pics enjoyment delivered by the charismatic Cook alongside his buddies played by Brian George Andy Dick (for once not manic) and Harland Williams with Bagley Ramirez and Woodburn in hilarious standout turns. Shepard somewhat overplays his hand as the seemingly lordly Vince while Simpson wont win new converts in a blah perf. Alas Marcello Thedford as a slow-witted African American guard flirts with a role right out of the Stepin Fetchit era. Even given that the production look is meant to depict a bland plain-wrap world where products matter more than people print screened was unusually blanched and lacking in sharpness. Product placement extends as far as the eye can see. Employee of the MonthProductionA Lionsgate release of a Lionsgate and Tapestry Films production. Produced by Andrew Panay Peter Abrams Robert L.
