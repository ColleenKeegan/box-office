This time high-school dweeb Peter Parker isnt such a nice guy at the outset hes a New Yorker after all and on top of that hes an orphan with a dad-shaped chip on his shoulder. And hes not such a hero by the end though he eventually accepts this films version of his Uncle Bens dictum (""With great power comes great responsibility"") hes still gotta keep a little something for himself you know? The story works hard to integrate various elements from Spideys history and the score works even harder to let you know what you should be feeling at any given moment. Star Andrew Garfield is all grins and grimaces Emma Stone is reliably adorable as love interest Gwen Stacy and Denis Leary is reliably testy as her police captain dad. Reader rating two stars.

Is there a reason we need a new ""Spider-Man"" movie 10 years after Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire got it done properly? Only if youre Sony Pictures and the lawyers say you have to keep the movies coming or the rights will revert to Marvel Comics. Thats correct ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a contract extension which is exactly how it plays on the screen. Dumbed down tarted up and almost shockingly uninspired its the worst superhero movie since ""Green Lantern.""Which is too bad because a lot of people myself included like Andrew Garfield and wish him well. The reedy intense young actor (""The Social Network"") is joined by a promising cast Emma Stone as Peter Parker/Spider-Mans high school sweetheart Gwen Stacy; Denis Leary as her police captain father; Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curtis Connors the scientist who tries to regrow his arm and oops turns into The Lizard. Theyre all actors who know what to do with smart dialogue.Which is not the same as knowing what to do with really stupid dialogue. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" reboots the comic-book saga from the beginning adding a few twists to Marvel orthodoxy. This time Peters father (Campbell Scott) was a geneticist who died mysteriously with his wife (Embeth Davidtz) in the boys youth leaving him to grow up with Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). Sneaking into the research corporation run by Connors his fathers former partner Peter stumbles into a secret lab in which modified spiders manufacture super-webs. Hes bitten. You know the rest.You can see what theyre trying to do here Inject an aging property with a little ""Harry Potter"" DNA. Nor is that the only cross-franchise genetic enhancement since the relationship between Gwen and Peter has been hotted up with as much tremulous ""Twilight"" heaving as possible. All thats missing from this Spider-Man is the lightning bolt on his forehead and some glitter. Gwen and a lot of teenage girls may be on Team Peter. Most of us will be on Team Some Other Movie.We do get the classic Spidey mask (inspired in one of the few successful comic touches by a Mexican wrestling poster). The script (by James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves) establishes that Peter is not a normal nerdy teenager -- only the premise the story has rested on for 50 years and a key to our identification with him -- but a scientific wunderkind who can memorize complex algorithms in a single bound and cook up highly technical web-shooters overnight. (It made more sense when they didnt explain it.) But nothing in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" holds water. Its the kind of movie where the hero can find his fathers glasses wear them for the rest of the running time and never once wonder why the prescription matches. Maybe youve come here for the action. Fair enough There isnt much of it and what there is has been edited into a mangle and squeezed through 3-D effects that achieve a new level of vulgarity. Not since 1981s ""Comin at Ya"" have this many things been thrown so witlessly at the camera and when Spider-Man slingshots himself through a cranes metallic tower you feel like youre watching a Six Flags cellphone video.Wheres the pop grace? Wheres the pulpy joy? Theres no scene that gets close to Raimis first ""Spider-Man"" movie with the hero swinging ecstatically through forests of skyscrapers or hanging upside down for a make-out session with Mary Jane. Stone has been given a blond dye job and it seems to have muted her sass; theres little chemistry with Garfields Peter since the star has decided to go the James Dean route of misunderstood twitches and averted looks. (The real Emma Stone could probably kick him into New Jersey.)But it may be too much to ask for chemistry when the dialogue is this inert. (Peter confessing all to Gwen ""Ive been bitten."" Gwen dazzled ""So have I."") The only one who gets a bit of top-spin on his lines is Leary who looks disgusted by the whole thing which granted is his default expression. Poor Ifans one of the more eccentric talents to come out of Wales spends half the movie as a very ugly digitized lizard-man.The director is Marc Webb whom the producers must have hired for his name. They certainly didnt hire him because he made ""(500) Days of Summer"" (2009) a charming little romantic comedy that is as far from a tentpole blockbuster as Marvel is from Shakespeare. He muffs the action sequences cant get the romance started and doesnt know how to use digital effects to create a cohesive alternate reality the way Raimi or Christopher Nolan in the ""Dark Knight"" movies can do without breaking a sweat.By the time we get to the films climax -- surprise it involves a doomsday device with a ticking countdown placed atop a skyscraper -- the cynicism of the whole enterprise has become unavoidable. The producers obviously think they only have to make a new ""Spider-Man"" and well show up and sadly theyre probably right. Thats still no excuse for this cash grab. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" isnt a movie its a mugging.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter tyburr. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

Director Marc Webb shares secrets of his power The Amazing Spider-Man game is a fine complement to the film -- just dont play it first Superhero movies are flying off the studio shelves like multimillion-dollar widgets and it seems new franchises alone cant fill all those seats. Reboots are inevitable if not necessary even when the franchise in question expired a mere five years ago.And so the three previous Spider-Man movies directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire give way to The Amazing Spider-Man directed by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield. At least the change is more than semantic This is a grittier webslinger saga led by a Peter Parker with swagger and angst and a tone defined more by emotional resonance than wide-eyed wonder. It still has plenty of fizz.It all starts with Garfield a fine English actor on his way to becoming an American movie star should he choose. Sporting a hoodie and an appealing sense of nervous distraction Garfields Peter Parker is both vulnerable and edgy. Obsessed with finding his missing parents smitten with high school crush Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone also excellent) this Peter is more tormented than the previous model and as a result easier to care about. When Peter and Gwen flirt they sound refreshingly like actual awkward teens.He has a worthy foe in Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) a one-armed scientist with a thing for species splicing and an old connection to Peters dad. Like many scientists in such movies he pushes natures limits a little too far and becomes the Lizard a character I remember from the old Spider-Man as a sort of snarling upright crocodile. Hes bigger now and meaner and thanks to 2012 digital effects he wreaks loud and significant havoc upon fair New York. (He also designs a fiendish terrorist scheme very similar to the one that concludes Batman Begins but well let that slide for now.)Theres a lot to like about this Spider-Man including a superhero who bleeds bruises and comes slinking home to his Aunt May (Sally Field) with a sheepish self-effacing grin. Theres also a trade-off here.Even with all the action including the requisite grand finale that doesnt drag on as long as some (Whats up Avengers?) the decidedly human scale takes a little something away from the fantastic voyage that all superhero movies need. The strengths of The Amazing Spider-Man specifically its insistence on crafting characters you might recognize in everyday life also contribute to its minor weaknesses. It doesnt always feel ... super.But its still a success. We like superheroes partially because they represent the unattainable but it never hurts when they give us something we can relate to. Peter learns the extent of his new powers in a subway ride marked by wicked comic timing; as he takes out passengers almost accidentally one by one he cant stop muttering his heartfelt apologies. Hes a bumbling teenager who doesnt know what to make of his new identity. In other words he could be almost anyone sitting in the audience to watch this movie.On Twitter chrisvognarThe Amazing Spider-Man (B+)Starring Andrew Garfield Emma Stone Rhys Ifans Denis Leary Martin Sheen and Sally Field.

Sony You know the story Young Bruce Wayne is out with his parents in Gotham City when the trio is mugged at gunpoint. Father and mother are both killed sowing the seeds for Bruces later obsession with justice and retribution (and spandex) as Batman.But wait. What if Bruces father didnt really die? What if he somehow survived the shooting and disappeared? What if his wound festered over the years twisting his mind and blackening his soul until one day he came back as... the Joker ""I am your father Bruce"" hed bellow as he prepared to hurl the caped crusader down a well into the Bat-Cave.The movie belongs to Garfield with his shy but wicked grin and Stone with her quiet indomitability. Okay its a bad idea (though Im copyrighting it just in case). But is it really that much worse than the revelatory new backstory with which Peter Parker has been saddled in The Amazing Spider-Man? It turns out that when Peter was a boy his scientist father was forced into hiding after engineering a brilliant breakthrough in interspecies genetic mutation. Once grown Peter tries to unravel this family secret which leads to his being bitten by a radioactive spider which leads to--well you know the rest. Its no mystery of course why the filmmakers involved in this latest reweaving of the Spidey yarn felt obligated to add new wrinkles. The last iteration (Sam Raimi Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst et al.) began a mere 10 years ago and feels as though it only just finished stumbling across its trilogic finish line. And apart from this new versions paternal complications it is assembled from terribly familiar pieces lonely Peter the class photog-nerd; decent homily-prone Uncle Ben and Aunt May; the bite; the powers; the robber-with-a-gun whom Peter could have stopped but didnt; the subsequent grief and chance for redemption; the avuncular Oscorp scientist whose experiments go badly awry... and on down the line.I didnt much want to like The Amazing Spider-Man on two conflicting grounds at once its redundancy and its infidelity the fact that it was telling an over-familiar story and the fact that it was telling it wrong. And I succeeded in not liking it for at least the first 20 minutes. But damned if I didnt little by little succumb to the films infectious zeal and hokey grandeur. It turns out that an unnecessary movie--even one as profoundly unnecessary as this one--can still be awfully good. Credit goes first to director Marc Webb. This is the second feature directed by the former music-video auteur and like the first (500) Days of Summer it is at once precision-engineered and full of insinuating charm. The superheroics are appropriately super In particular Webb revitalizes the experience of Spidey swooping down the avenues of Manhattan offering a palpable heft and delirious momentum that had been lacking from the relatively two-dimensional CGI of Raimis version. As Duke Ellington informed us long ago it dont mean a thing if it aint got that swing. But at its best The Amazing Spider-Man is really another story of boy meets girl and here Webb is assisted immeasurably by his young leads. As Peter Andrew Garfield (best known for playing Eduardo Saverin in The Social Network) offers rather sharper edges than Tobey Maguire. He may still be an outsider but his restless energy glows deeper and hotter instead of burning itself off in flares of skittishness. As the object of Peters teen ardor were afforded Emma Stones Gwen Stacy in place of Kirsten Dunsts Mary Jane Watson--an upgrade comparable to opting for Manolo Blahniks in place of well Mary Janes. Theres a fierce yet amiable intelligence to Stone with her penetrating blue eyes and Kathleen-Turner purr and her Gwen is among the strongest female characters the super genre has yet produced. There are times indeed when one wonders whether Spider-Man is even necessary at all. MORE ON MOVIES Male Strippers Reveal the Naked Truth About the Recession Woody Allen Has Officially Lost It Does It Matter If the Heroine of Brave Is Gay? I Babysat the Moonrise Kingdom Kid Our Picks for Which Film to Catch Each Week of Summer As for the rest of the cast Martin Sheen riffs effortlessly as Uncle Ben and Rhys Ifans offers a sturdy turn as this versions benevolent-scientist-turned-homicidal-monster. Denis Leary may lay it on a bit thick as Gwens police-chief dad though and Sally Field is just a bit too Sally Field ever to disappear into the role of Aunt May. But the movie belongs to Garfield with his shy but wicked grin and Stone with her quiet indomitability. Webb entwines the heroic and romantic storylines nimbly offering gentle nods not merely to earlier iterations of the webcrawler but to the original Superman Hellboy and others. Visual treats are scattered throughout--two concentric rings of purply irradiated spiders spinning lazily; an underground network of early-warning webbing--and the movie features what may be Stan Lees best cameo in a Marvel film to date. There are times in the latter half especially when the film teeters on the verge of the overwrought and maudlin but for the most part it manages to land on the right side of the line (though it might have been wiser if Webb had concluded the proceedings five minutes earlier). In all The Amazing Spider-Man is considerably more fun--and yes even touching--than so premature a reboot had any right to be. In particular theres a lovely scene between Peter and Gwen on the rooftop of her Queens apartment building in which he tries to confess to her his arachnoid powers but she takes his words for an admission of an altogether different kind. ""Ive been bitten..."" he begins. She interrupts ""So have I."" Despite my best efforts I was too.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

Thats right go all the way back to 2002. Viewers who lined up for Sam Raimis first installment must have been an odd bunch. Waiting patiently they probably annoyed each other with their dumb phones and Avril Lavigne ring tones. Easing into the viewing experience these primitive ancestors settled for faintly unrealistic special effects and the wiles of a young Tobey Maguire. How innocent it all must have seemed. Of course you do remember Its way too soon for a reboot but if you enjoy making Sony wealthy things could be worse. The Social Networks Andrew Garfield isnt a chirping geek like Maguire so effortlessly was but his moody skate-rat conception of Peter Parker--complete with abandonment issues and a teary sulk--works fine. Actually it makes more sense for a budding vigilante motivated this time by the memory of missing parents (whose backstory is left coyly unexplored a rip-off). Emma Stones science babe has marginally more to do than Kirsten Dunst did but shes still not a fully fleshed-out character. Meanwhile scheming Rhys Ifans should be devolving into a lizard any minute now. On the whole its passable stuff a surprise given how mechanical the masked character seemed. (Garfield takes his off a lot.) Even though youll miss that iconic upside-down kiss and the presence of barking boss J. Jonah Jameson (the editor character has been nixed) theres enough exhilaration in Parkers wall-clinging sense of discovery to make the story feel eternal. Marvels hero--like many others--channels the sticky substance of adolescence into a purpose. Maybe thats a tale worth retelling even prematurely.

Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is a high school student who suffers from the normal bullying and ""not being noticed by girls"" phase. Hes a quiet kid but a smart one generally respectful of his Aunt May and Uncle Bens wishes the type of fellow who stands up against bullies even when he has no hope of triumphing. Unfortunately for Peter while hes standing up for the little guy the teachers at his high school allow him to take a few kicks to the ribs. Thankfully he at least has a potential friend-admirer in Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) to pick him up and scrape off the dirt. Shes a science whiz kid the only student who is ahead of Peter the perfect love match for our budding superhero. Now then if you know the title of the film you can probably guess where this is headed. Peter will become more than a teenager and hell have to fight off a terrible super-baddie to save New York City. Will this all add up to a rockin Spidey origin story? Lets do the math together The ""Spider-Man"" saga stands alone with its transformative method as Peter is neither born that way (Superman) nor a rich billionaire playboy (Batman Iron Man). Hes probably the closest in pedigree to The Hulk though Peters tragic origin story mirrors Bruce Waynes in the ""father-figure disaster"" technique. In ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" Peters initial transformation to Spidey is by far the most stylish and interesting thing the movie does. Well that and young Emma Stones general stage presence she proves to be a formidable romantic interest in a more interesting way than Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) was. While were on the subject of legacy and kudos Andrew Garfield proves hes going to have a long and rewarding career and I say were just getting started on what director Marc Webb can accomplish as well. Sadly there are a few issues with ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". The first is a matter of cultural relevance Its a ""reboot"" of a film thats barely even 10 years in the past apparently targeting that lucrative ""people who saw their first movie in 2005"" demographic. You cant reboot something thats been so recently booted up otherwise well start skipping three-quels altogether instead going straight for the ""reboot"" button every time with parallel superhero stories spiraling out of control toward chaos. The second sticking point is the innovation quotient which ""Amazing Spider-Man"" doesnt really ever deliver relying instead on superhero movie tropes throughout. If youve seen half a dozen superhero films and the box office results suggest you have then youve also seen what ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has to offer. The third issue is the complete lack of a compelling villain. None of these factors individually make the film a lost cause but taken all together they definitely dont help matters. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a very safe film but within the context of an evolving genre. Whether you go for the soaring silliness of ""The Avengers"" or the brutal grit of Nolans ""Dark Knight"" -- choices must be made. And ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" doesnt make nearly enough of them. Also Check Out Directors Cut - Marc Webb on The Amazing Spider-Man It would be fair to say that the comic book genre is now simpatico with the rom-com genre. Some are fun like ""Iron Man"" and ""500 Days of Summer"" some are excellent like ""V for Vendetta"" and ""Amelie"" but most fall in that middle range where its hard to remember anything distinguishing about the piece afterward. Sure they are perfectly palatable throw-way entertainment morsels never quite reaching the potential of a full meal deal but never actively offending either. Thats ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" perfectly fine as youre watching but never standing out enough to differentiate itself in a crowded field. The relationships are a slight improvement Aunt May (Sally Field) is bearable throughout unlike previous iterations and ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a far better film than ""Spider-Man 3."" Gone are Sam Raimis strange ""singin and dancin Tobey Maguire scenes replaced by something more organic and thoughtful. Still this is nothing truly ""amazing"" as ""Spider-Man 3"" was a catastrophe. Merely being average isnt a huge accomplishment for a film produced on this grand of a scale. There are three people credited on this screenplay and I like to imagine they emailed it around mad-libs style and were a little surprised when someone thought up the ""giant reptile"" angle as a bad guy. ""Oh dear"" I imagine one of them saying as he read through ""I would not have gone this direction."" Still well never know who was who in the equation where precisely to place blame and the chances are decent that the studio was changing each and every scene and spoken word to please the focus groups. ""Giant Lizards will play internationally"" you can hear them thinking while writing ""we need the cops to HATE Spidey for no apparent reason"" all over the script in purple crayon. Tropes tropes tropes enough of them that you could very well surmise that the creators were going for a ""comic book"" feel divorced from our modern world. But the film is set in New York Youll see a giant reptile with a lab coat a chief shout ""I want Spider-Man off the streets"" and a countdown clock to doom. While its handy that the bad guys always have to start the clock at two minutes I worry about the day when they can instantly foist their evil plans upon us. Youll see all these things and more and when its all over the next morning youll struggle to remember exactly which scenes impressed you at all.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Emma Stone left and Andrew Garfield star in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" as Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker respectively.Story highlights""The Amazing Spider-Man"" sings the same old song as its predecessorsThere are some improvements with the best being Andrew Garfield as Peter ParkerBut none of its positives can dispel the whiff of deja vuWhen it comes to rebooting Marvels tale of an adolescent web crawler Sony seems more than happy to sing the same old song with todays release of ""The Amazing Spider-Man.""Only 10 years have passed since Tobey Maguire started swinging through the urban jungle in ""Spider-Man"" and now Andrew Garfield is stepping into his flight path in what often feels like a straight-up remake. Considering how important the idea of evolution is to this story is it unreasonable to expect something more inventive than the same origin tale? Note to Sony The entire planet saw Sam Raimis ""Spider-Man"" and you guys know this better than anyone Copping iconic scenes from ""Superman"" ""Batman"" and ""King Kong"" only makes matters worse. Yes there are variations; ""Amazing"" isnt a carbon copy. And to some extent there are improvements. The biggest plus point has to be Garfield the Anglo-American actor who played Mark Zuckerbergs former friend and ally in ""The Social Network.""At 28 Garfields slightly older than Maguire was when he played Peter Parker in 2002 but his combination of fresh-faced innocence nervous agitation and wry humor is immediately appealing. JUST WATCHEDLatest Spider-Man film hits theatresReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLatest Spider-Man film hits theatres 0158JUST WATCHEDHere comes the Spider-ManReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHere comes the Spider-Man 0105Garfields Peter is still very much a boy -- the prologue introduces him as a child searching for the father hes about to lose. Hes a good-hearted curious kid who isnt prepared for the hormonal surges that sweep his body shortly after hes been bitten by a genetically modified spider in the research laboratory of one Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans). The next thing Peter knows hes climbing the walls. Hes stronger stickier and getting a good deal further than he ever thought possible with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Not surprisingly director Marc Webb -- whose last film was the sleeper rom-com ""(500) Days of Summer"" -- employs a deft hand with the relationship scenes and Garfield and Stone have a nice frisky rapport. The dialogue scenes are light and ""on point."" But none of this can dispel the whiff of deja vu.At least we get a new bad guy. When the semi-sympathetic Dr. Connors rashly doses himself into a poor mans Godzilla -- a Middle-aged Mutant Ninja Lizard -- Webb dutifully strings together three or four wham-bang set pieces including a novel interlude in the sewers where Spidey spins his own advance warning system a welcome breath of presumably foul air after all his usual zip-lining antics.The action is mostly coherent and the CGI is a notch or four up from the first Sam Raimi movie but not a significant advance on the last of them unless youre crazy for 3-D. (A couple of dizzying subjective close-ups do make the case for it -- but theyre the exceptions.)This is yet another blockbuster sprinkled with numerous continuity errors ridiculous coincidences contrivances and gaping lapses in logic. To take just one minor example An 8-foot reptile rampages across the Williamsburg bridge during rush hour and no one gets a photograph? And just because it runs two-and-a-quarter hours doesnt mean you should expect the filmmakers to tie up loose ends. The sinister billionaire who is bankrolling Connors work some chap by the name of Osborne remains ominously off-screen and we never do find out what happened to Peters parents. But I suppose thats not carelessness as much as its confidence. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is slick and entertaining and artfully packaged and Andrew Garfield is utterly engaging so yes you can count on seeing more of the same.

Tobey Maguires Spider-Man was last slinging webs just five years ago. Broadways Spider-Man started singing about webs less than two years ago. Now here comes another Spider-dude This Andrew Garfield guy. So hed better be really something right? Well as it happens he is. Garfields no younger than Maguire was when he first played Peter Parker -- the slightly stir-crazy kid who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and starts climbing the walls more literally than most high-schoolers -- but Garfields a lot more appealing and is also one thing that Maguire kinda wasnt. Hes convincing as a teenager. Skinny and lanky as if hes just shot up three inches and is still growing into the extra height Garfield s Peter Parker is a skateboarder so suddenly having sticky fingers and toes definitely comes in handy. Superstrength too though you get the sense that hed trade it for a little superconfidence around the girl he has a crush on. (Of course supershyness has its appeal too.) Garfield and Emma Stone are terrific together and theyre surrounded by performers with the acting chops to root a comic-book narrative in the real world -- Sally Field and Martin Sheen as Aunt May and Uncle Ben Rhys Ifans as a one-armed doctor who has good reason to wonder about the ability of geckos to regrow an amputated tail -- not just to repair himself but to create ""a world without weakness."" Grand plans those to go with a new back story about Peters scientist dad plus new gadgetry for web-slinging and new subtext about abandonment issues. All of which means director Marc Webb -- yes thats his real name -- isnt just reweaving the origin tale spun by Sam Raimi 10 years ago. Webbs only previous feature a quirky little indie romance called 500 Days of Summer hardly seems to qualify him to make a special-effects blockbuster but a youthfully quirky vibe turns out to be just right for the storys romance and it doesnt hurt when Webb is say imagining the kinship that crane operators might feel for a guy who swings from tall buildings. Its only when the rules of the genre require that our hero meet a giant lizard atop a skyscraper that The Amazing Spider-Man gets a little less amazing. There are only so many ways to bring the characters back down without bringing the audience down. Still this origin story has had enough nice surprises by that point that even those who like their genre plotlines very taut will be inclined to cut The Amazing Spider-Man a little slack.

Universal Studios The trilateral love commission with its overtones of Butch Sundance and Etta (or for that matter Jules Jim and Catherine) is comprised of Mr. Kitschs Chon Aaron Johnsons Ben and Blake Livelys O as in Ophelia--""the bipolar basket case"" she explains helpfully ""who committed suicide in Hamlet. "" O further explains that Chon is cold metal Ben is warm wood and together they make one man. That contrast diminishes as time goes by; both men change in substantial ways. (The supercharged script was adapted by Shane Salerno Mr. Stone and Don Winslow from Mr. Winslows novel.) At the outset though Chon a Navy SEAL veteran of Iraq and Ben a Berkeley graduate with degrees in business and botany seem very much as O describes them. Partners in a Southern California enterprise that promotes--at least for them--better living through botany they grow and distribute weed of such legendary quality that a powerful cartel from south of the border offers big benefits in exchange for part of their product. Its an offer they cant refuse but they refuse it all the same a decision that changes the threesomes fate. While the savagery of ""Savages"" first emanates from the cartel the story tracks the increasingly desperate measures that Chon and Ben take to secure the safety of the woman they adore and to exact sweet revenge. After two flops not of his own making--""John Carter"" and ""Battleship""--Mr. Kitsch makes Chon a man of few words and deep feelings a knight of honor who reminded me of Russell Crowes Bud White in ""L.A. Confidential."" Mr. Johnson portrays Bens quirks and complexities with an admirable absence of comment--the glib idealism that has him touting the potential of a 10 solar panel in rural Africa the wimpiness that leads him to see the Mexican thugs as businessmen rather than the savages Chon sees. (The movie is tough on liberal optimism.) Ms. Livelys first task is to be as beautiful and seductive as O must be to keep her two guys hungry and happy; she is that and then much more when events test Os talents as a survivor. John Travolta is an American drug enforcement agent of fungible integrity; the actor plays the relatively small role with hardly a trace of the florid tropes he often favors. Benicio Del Toros Lado is a savage impure and simple who can make cutting a steak seem ominous; give him a nail gun and hed be as malign as Javier Bardems Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men."" The movies great surprise and delight is Salma Hayeks Elena a svelte monster with a Cleopatra haircut who runs the cartel. Ms. Hayek gives a showstopper of a performance in a shrewdly conceived role not because her Elena is given to flashiness but because shes quick-witted scarily focused improbably droll and--the biggest surprise of all--capable of genuine human feeling. Thats evident in the movies best scene when Elena and O come face to face as captor and captive and O revealing a sweetly banal attitude toward life rambles on about her days at a community college and her charmed existence with Chon and Ben. ""Do Americans always talk like that?"" Elena asks when O finally subsides. ""Do you ever think about the future?"" Her questions arent meant to be hostile. Shes genuinely baffled by this golden child and touched by the motherly instincts that Os tenderness provokes. ""Savages"" which was shot by Dan Mindel is all over the place stylistically--its spirit is so inclusive as to welcome brightly lighted recollections of ""Beach Blanket Bingo."" And the runtime is too long by at least 10 of its 130 minutes. (A character played by Uma Thurman was reportedly excised.) Thats not a surprise in an Oliver Stone production Mr. Stones filmmaking energies have always resisted safe containment. But his direction is nicely loose when its not action-taut; theres a playfulness that seems to say What the hell lets let things take whatever course they need to take. Its an unlikely formula for success. The Amazing Spider-Man Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone star in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. Watch a clip of the film. Video courtesy of Sony Pictures. A full appreciation of ""The Amazing Spider-Man""--theres plenty of fancy action to appreciate--requires not only a willing suspension of disbelief but a suspension of memory. The truly amazing thing is that most of what happens to Peter Parker in the first half of the film has already happened in previous chapters of the Spidey saga. Some differences exist to be sure. Peter is played by a different actor--Andrew Garfield instead of Tobey Maguire. Instead of being bitten by a single spider hes now munched on by several. But he gets the same lecture on responsibility from Uncle Ben goes through the same grief over Bens fate discovers the same superpowers in belabor-intensive ways invents the same uniform and mask. This hugely elaborate production is supposed to be the reboot of a foundering franchise but rebooting a computer wipes the silicon slate clean. In the movie whats old is old again. Whats new comes courtesy of technology. Spideys webslinging has been upgraded to spectacular laserlike marksmanship. The flying sequences in unexceptional 3-D have Spider-Man swooping swinging and soaring around midtown Manhattan with ever greater maneuverability. Yet even these blessings of the digital domain are mixed. Theyre oddly joyless demonstrations of hypergymnastics extravagant motion with meager emotion. ENLARGE Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man. Columbia Pictures At one point in fact the movie completely blows an opportunity for airborne wonderment. Its the moment when Peter/Spidey takes his girlfriend for her first cobwebbed ride. (Her name is now Gwen not Mary Jane and shes played by Emma Stone not Kirsten Dunst.) Secretly together in her bedroom they want to leave the apartment without her parents knowing hes been there so they leap out of the window Gwen hanging on to him for dear life. Yet we never get to see her reaction let alone experience the plummeting descent and presumed upswoop from her point of view The next shot shows nothing but two tiny dots swinging past the camera at the end of a very long web. The director Marc Webb presides over many elisions and lapses. We dont see the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) into the giant mutant known as the Lizard; the process starts in a taxicab but the next thing you know the Lizard is scaling the Williamsburg Bridge in all his enormous monstrosity. (Smaller lizards start swarming around the city but the story loses track of them just as it loses track of a villainous scientist played by the splendid Indian actor Irrfan Khan.) Peter needs to penetrate the inner sanctum of a supposedly impenetrable laboratory where deadly pathogens are being manufactured so he simply goes online does a quick bit of Googling gets the info he needs slips into the lab and wanders around unnoticed. Gwen a student at the high school Peter attends--they both look old enough for doctoral programs--conveniently works at the lab when she isnt in class. ENLARGE Andrew Garfield Jamie Trueblood/ (c) Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection Related Speakeasy Andrew Garfield Pulls Off Spider-Mans Mask Theres a sense of filling time with lame contrivance. In a convenience store Peter witnesses an argument about a penny that offends common sense. When it looks like Spidey is too weakened to prevail in the climactic battle with the Lizard everything pauses for a dopey interlude in which all the construction cranes on Sixth Avenue position their booms at a 90-degree angle so Spidey can swing from one to the next with greater ease on his trip uptown or maybe downtown. Yet the mystery that sets the plot in motion--what happened to Peters parents after they disappeared--is never resolved. (This Uncle Ben is played by Martin Sheen while Aunt May is now played by Sally Field made up to look absurdly haggard. Blue-collar women wash their hair too.) The film does open the heros soul to more than the nerdiness and repression of earlier incarnations. Peter Parker is now given to rage scorn humor and romance though the ragged script--credited to James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves--gives the star little chance for emotional nuance. Which brings us back to the need for suspension of memory. If you can forget what you know about how appealing Mr. Garfield was in ""The Social Network""; about how sensationally witty Ms. Stone was in ""Easy A"" (she has been reduced to a foil for Peters moods and needs); about the excitement of sexual tension (theres almost none between Peter and Gwen); about the pleasures of well-crafted drama (scene after shaky scene drifts off tentatively) and about movies that deliver on their promises (this origin tale turns into a wait-for-the-next-episode tease) then you can watch ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" without a sinking sense of being gypped. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com ENLARGE DVD Focus Miss Bala (2011) The Mexican drug wars seen from Mexico entirely through the eyes of a beauty-contest winner. Laura (Stephanie Sigman) a 23-year-old innocent from Tijuana falls into the clutches of the Baja California narco gang that engineered her triumph. (The ironic title means ""Miss Bullet."") Gerardo Naranjo the filmmaker who wrote this shockingly powerful film with Mauricio Katz never insists on symbols--theres too much action and agonizing suspense for that--but its irresistible to see his heroine as a stand-in for her beautiful country increasingly a hostage to savage crime. Frida (2002) Salma Hayek produced and stars in this English-language feature directed by Julie Taymor about the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and her tumultuous love affair with the muralist Diego Rivera; hes played by Alfred Molina. The film is inventive and gorgeously colored from the opening shot of a peacock in a garden to later renderings of Kahlos paintings as tableaux vivants. But the script based on Hayden Herreras biography resembles Riveras murals--its writ large broad and flat with spasms of agitprop style that come together as heavily as the ox-yoke eyebrows on Fridas face. Easy A (2010) The movie that made Emma Stone a star. I know Im like a broken record in recommending it but this high-school comedy directed by Will Gluck from an elated and elating screenplay by Bert V. Royal hasnt received the respect or success it deserves. Ms. Stone plays Olive Penderghast an Ojai Calif. high-school student who goes to class in a bustier emblazoned with the scarlet A of an adulteress. How she reaches this point is a convoluted story and a hilarious one. Suffice it to say that Olive identifies intensely with Hester Prynne the outcast heroine of ""The Scarlet Letter."" --Joe Morgenstern Explore More Gleason Review Inspiration Off the Gridiron Jason Bourne Review Looping Old Loops Indignation Review Life and Love in the 50s Star Trek Beyond Review Boldly Going Where It Has Been Dont Think Twice Review Making It Up as We Go Lights Out Review Flickering Frights Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

In fact she says ""Im here to tell you there is only one."" Slideshow Spider-Man through the years Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about The Amazing Spider-Man >> In other words dont come to The Amazing-Spider-Man looking for originality. A competent though entirely unnecessary reengineering of the Marvel Comics title -- arriving 10 years and two months after Sam Raimis more fun more energized Spider-Man and just five years since Spider-Man 3 -- The Amazing Spider-Man brings fresh faces and 3-D bells and whistles to the adventures of a moody nerd-boy who gets bitten by a radioactive arachnid and morphs into a smart-talking web-slinging thug-busting superhero. Andrew Garfield the Brit who played Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin in The Social Network picks up the Spidey mask dropped by Tobey Maguire bringing a spindly physique and twitchy angst to his portrayal of Peter Parker the Queens kid who lives with his kindly uncle and aunt (Martin Sheen and Sally Field) and becomes a unitarded vigilante to avenge the death of you-know-who and thwart the evil machinations of a ya-da-ya-da. The evil machinations in director Marc Webbs version (talk about aptly named) come courtesy of The Lizard one of the oldest of Spideys comic book nemeses played here in human form as scientist Dr. Curt Connors by Rhys Ifans. Connors were told is ""the worlds foremost authority on herpetology"" the study of reptiles and amphibians and as it happens was long ago partnered with Parkers brilliant geneticist dad on a cross-species tissue regeneration project. Connors lost his arm in a laboratory mishap so he has a personal interest in this regeneration business. And young Parker has his fathers old notebooks and the decay-rate algorithm that is essential to the equation -- and that serves as The Amazing Spider-Mans plot-propelling MacGuffin. (Speaking of MacGuffins Parker has a poster of Hitchcocks Rear Window on his bedroom wall.) And then there is saucy saucer-eyed Gwen Stacy (a very blond Emma Stone) who is a.) Parkers high-school classmate and impossible object of desire b.) Dr. Connors favorite intern at Oscorp labs and c.) the daughter of NYPD Capt. George Stacy (Denis Leary) who decides that this Spider-Man guy shouldnt be allowed to disrupt traffic with his crime-fighting antics. (Note to Leary and to Field do not let your agents talk you into doing another 3-D film. The scrutiny of the stereoscopic format is not flattering) The Amazing Spider-Man is very much a story in two parts The first hour is spent establishing Parkers backstory and Spider-Mans origins. We witness Parkers subway-ride discovery of his newfound powers and the havoc they can wreak; the skateboarding stunts he is now capable of (another poster in Parkers bedroom Mark Gonzalez the street-skating pioneer); his awkward courtship of Gwen and the worried look in Uncle Bens and Aunt Mays eyes as the boy they have raised since toddlerhood starts staying out late and coming home with big bruises and a bad case of the munchies. The second half of the film is a pile-on of CGI effects and thundering face-offs between Spidey and The Lizard. Theres a daring rescue in the middle of the Williamsburg Bridge and theres plenty of skyscraper-scaling slugfests as Spidey has to contend with the gigantic reptile iteration of the Welsh actor Ifans and save a huge chunk of Manhattan from a chemical fallout that could turn the population into lizards. (Dont go into the sewers Theyre literally crawling with the things) The Oscorp Tower an architectural wonder that gives The Avengers Stark Tower a run for its money is where everything comes to a loud climactic head. You can practically feel Webb director of the charmingly gimmicky love story (500) Days of Summer get overrun by effects techies and stunt choreographers and hologram designers. The Amazing Spider-Man goes from what is essentially a teenage identity-crisis love story with nice quirky moments in it (Garfield and Stone shoot sparks) to a studio-ordered supersized slam-bang summer tentpole. Audiences will probably respond to it -- Spider-Man after all is one of Marvels true icons a Silver Age hero with us since the early 1960s -- but this one was made to please a more select demographic Sony shareholders. Like most superhero movies The Amazing Spider-Man taps into our primal dreams and desires. Emotional and physical flaws feelings of inadequacy our losses and lost chances ... all are given a chance at redress and redemption. Its hard not to respond to stuff like that on some level. But its also hard to keep interested in the big screen big noise big whoop of it all. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Share Tweet While it might seem odd for a movie to offer a new take on Spider-Man just five years after Spider-Man 3 the final Sam Raimi-directed film in a series that began in 2002 that sort of quick change isnt unprecedented in the web-slingers history. But The Amazing Spider-Man helmed by (500) Days Of Summer director Marc Webb doesnt put its own stamp on the material which feels warmed-over in ways that dont help. Hitting the reset button The Amazing Spider-Man retells the story of Spider-Mans origins yet again. Andrew Garfield steps into the shoes of Peter Parker a friendless New York high-schooler being raised by his caring Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). Then visit to high-tech lab spider bite wall-crawling dead Uncle Ben angst character motivation crime-fighting. Amazing focuses on elements of Spider-Man lore not at the center of the last batch of Spider-Man films however opening with the mysterious deaths of Peters scientist parents eschewing Mary Jane and Harry Osborn and bringing in Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) Spider-Mans other notable girlfriend as the love interest. Too bad the film mostly distinguishes itself by not being a Raimi film. While Spider-Man 3 didnt work out so well the first two were notable for their emphasis on character classically stylish filmmaking and affection for the source material. Amazing only matches them when it turns its attention to the characters. Garfield and Stone make compelling leads with Garfields slow accumulation of confidence giving the film its spine and Stone bringing an abundance of personality to a character who otherwise might have gotten lost in the mix. When the films attention drifts elsewhere however it runs into trouble. The script--credited to James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves--unsatisfyingly jumbles together a bunch of plot points and supporting characters tying the death of Peters parents to the bioengineering activities of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) whose experiments with regrowing his lost arm transform him into the villainous Lizard. They dont however give the character any dimension either in human form or when he takes the form of a hissing reptile/human hybrid and starts attacking New York. Those attacks at least give the film some momentum in its final act but nothing covers up the absence of any real visual flair or a unique take on the material. Its the most anonymous superhero film since Green Lantern.

Videojournalist Patrick Mullooly and Sony Entertainment. (July 3 2012) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Peter Parker newly transformed into Spider-Man meets his first villain The Lizard. BOTTOM LINE A disappointment on every level from Garfields sullen performance to the dull script that plods old roads. Decent special effects though. CAST Andrew Garfield Emma Stone Rhys Ifans Denis Leary. LENGTH 218 After all the special effects freaky villains and James Franco only one thing from the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy sticks with me. Its the first films dream-come-true sequence with a newly bitten Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) scooping up pretty Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) then flattening the bully Flash Thompson. Those rousing three minutes are the heart of the story and it kept beating even through two hollow sequels. Theres nothing nearly that fresh fun or emotionally satisfying in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a much-hyped expensive-looking and ultimately soulless reboot. It spends a lot of time improving Spideys gear -- textured Spandex stronger webbing -- but fails to do the one thing it was created to do bring something new to a familiar tale. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" sends Peter back to high-school but Maguires replacement Andrew Garfield makes for a sullen sour Peter. He uses his new powers to humiliate people -- my heart actually went out to Flash (Chris Zylka) -- and his idea of repartee is nasty and inane. While fighting Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) a one-armed scientist transformed into a giant reptile -- Spidey stoops to schoolyard taunts ""Ooh somebodys been a baaad lizard"" Director Marc Webb of the indie charmer ""(500) Days of Summer"" seems overwhelmed by the unoriginality of it all. He never strikes the right pace Peters search for his uncles killer (Martin Sheen and Sally Field play Uncle Ben and Aunt May) goes on forever while his courtship of Gwen Stacey (a sparkling Emma Stone) succeeds too quickly. The climactic battle on a giant office tower is remarkably stale as old as ""King Kong"" and as recently recycled as ""Marvels The Avengers."" ""With great power comes great responsibility"" went the still-quotable line from the first ""Spider-Man"" film. ""Responsibility not choice"" is the new far less musical version. Its a pretty poor substitute. 222 VideoAmazing Spider-Man talks to Kidsday PLOT Peter Parker newly transformed into Spider-Man meets his first villain The Lizard.

Pop culture reinvents itself even more ably than capitalism-at-large does. (Actually capitalism-at-large is having some problems with that at the moment.) That goes double for comic-book characters the ersatz gods of our age who get spread diffusely across a wide range of media and audiences until they stop being characters at all and become a Heisenbergian smear of uncertainty. In what sense can the Batman of the 1930s Detective Comics series the Adam West Batman of early 1960s camp television and the Christian Bale Batman of ""The Dark Knight"" be said to be the same ""person""?It might go triple for Spider-Man who is a full generation younger than Superman or Batman and has a particular cultural resonance they do not. All efforts to splice complexity ambiguity and doubt into the personality of those classic DC Comics heroes -- while perhaps laudable in narrative terms -- are essentially heretical. In their most classical forms Superman and Batman are suit-clad adult men hardened by the Depression psychologically impregnable and physically unbeatable. If they belong to the Greatest Generation Spidey is a baby-boomer who sprang to life as an anxious teenager in early 1960s New York just as the city and the country and the culture stood on the precipice of enormous transformation.From the very beginning Marvels Spider-Man comics had an element of teen melodrama and there was a tension between the comic-book universe and the real world that was unprecedented and then widely imitated. Peter Parker was much much closer to being a comics reader than Clark Kent or Bruce Wayne could ever be and something about that strong sense of identification between Spidey and his fans has sparked an ever-metastasizing universe of alternate plot lines and possibilities. Im not nearly enough of a fan to grasp all of them but even in the ""mainstream"" Spider-Man story Peters marriage to Mary Jane Parker was erased from memory after many years dead characters were resurrected and the ""timeline"" was rolled back. Lets not even go into the universes where Spider-Man is Korean or Latino or a flesh-eating zombie or a psychopathic killer or an Elizabethan apprentice spymaster.While there has been tremendous discussion among historians and scholars about the contributions of Marvel Comics legends Stan Lee Steve Ditko and Jack Kirby in creating Spider-Man as well as about the numerous possible sources of inspiration -- a pulp-magazine crime-fighter called the Spider an Archie Comics hero called the Fly a 1950s character prototype called the Silver Spider and even a 1947 one-off villain actually named Spider Man -- one obvious source is often overlooked. Orphaned high-school wunderkind Peter Parker made his first appearance in print about a decade after the publication of ""The Catcher in the Rye"" at the very height of J.D. Salingers fame and influence. Solitary haunted by guilt and sworn to defend the weak Peter is a virtual clone of Salingers Holden Caulfield albeit with a fantasy alter ego Holden lacks.Holdens famous soliloquy about where the Central Park ducks go in winter when the parks southern lagoon freezes over -- this was in the years before global warming when the lagoon actually did freeze over -- would make a perfect Peter Parker thought balloon almost word for word. And I can see this passage translated into a couple of panels in a late 60s or early 70s Spider-Man comic when Peter takes a wintry afternoon stroll through Manhattan while hes on the outs with Gwen or Mary Jane or whatever girl it is at the momentWhile I was walking I saw these two guys that were unloading this big Christmas tree off a truck. One guy kept saying to the other guy ""Hold the sonuvabitch up. Hold it up for Chrissake"" It certainly was a gorgeous way to talk about a Christmas tree.I guess the mask is officially off the Spidey-Holden connection given that Andrew Garfield who plays the title role in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" (which is certainly intended to launch a new series) has made it explicit ""Peter Parker has been the one fictional character I related to growing up that and Holden Caulfield."" This seems odd given that Garfield was born in 1983 and mostly grew up in England (although hes American by birth) but it certainly provides a key to his alternately strained and ingratiating performance with its sense that Peter cant quite stand anything about ordinary life and remains pissed off at everybody the entire time. You Might Also Like Since Ive made you wait this long for any sort of review of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" here it is Pretty good summer flick A non-insulting generally likable retake on Spideys origins that is somewhat closer to the original comic books and is geared particularly for teens and older tweens. Director Marc Webb actually shot it in 3-D (instead of converting after the fact) and as with ""Prometheus"" and ""Hugo"" the difference is enormous. I suppose its typical that just as Hollywood has beaten the whole 3-D thing to death directors are starting to figure it out. But all the excellent supporting players in this movie -- Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans and Martin Sheen and Sally Field -- are pretty much afterthoughts to Garfields angsty glass-chewing central performance. And once you get around to asking why this movie should exist in the first place only five years after Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst and Sam Raimi made ""Spider-Man 3"" its pretty clear that theres no answer. (Or at least none that doesnt involve a number with lots of zeroes at the end.)Ive always liked Garfield in his British roles which included a Holden-esque turn as the troubled ex-convict protagonist of ""Boy A"" but the problem with him playing Holden-as-Spidey is that hes following Maguire an actor who pretty much has Holden Caulfield in his veins instead of blood. Garfield is simply too tall and good-looking with his perfect hair and lean athletic frame to pull off Peter as a science nerd and social outcast. But that same degree of non-realism that sense that the movie is set not in the present or the past but in some vague imaginary in-between plagues all of ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" Peter and his comely thigh-high-clad Gwen (Emma Stone) chat by smartphone and one-armed scientist Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) has a lab that sports all sorts of cool high-end computer imaging tools. But this is a version of 2012 by way of Spideys 1962 origins where the outer boroughs of New York are still populated by working-class Anglos like Peters Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field) and the street thugs all look like those stringy-haired white guys in leather jackets youd see in a burglar-alarm commercial. (Not to mention that Peter and Gwens ostentatiously fake ""Midtown Science High School"" or whatever its called is clearly in Los Angeles.) Im not necessarily saying that I want a fully social-realist Spider-Man universe with Mike Bloomberg and Al Sharpton playing themselves and Peter as a gay Urdu-speaking immigrant or something. (Although come to think of it that might be cool.) Im not necessarily questioning the decision to ditch the Raimi franchise and start over since those movies at least arguably had run out of creative gas by ""Spider-Man 3."" I am saying that the Raimi movies had bright primary colors exaggerated production design and amped-up CGI effects that bespoke a distinctive artistic signature while this one feels intentionally indecisive and constructed by committee. (The writers include James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves.) Its a generally agreeable and occasionally exciting picture but one with major plot holes hit-and-miss effects and a dedication to pleasing everybody and alienating nobody. I could almost take my eight-year-old son to it (and may do so after the proper preparation). It will make a lot of money and be rapidly forgotten and soon enough Spider-Man will be reincarnated in some other guise. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

By Anthony Lane A superhero soars again.   Credit Photograph by Grant Cornett When someone reboots a film franchise as the makers of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" have done what are we meant to think of the original boot? The first ""Spider-Man"" came out in 2002 followed by its obligatory sequels in 2004 and 2007. If you are a twenty-year-old male of unvarnished social aptitude those movies will seem like much-loved classics that have eaten up half your lifetime. They beg to be interpreted anew just as Shakespeares history plays should be freshly staged by every generation. For those of us who are lavishly cobwebbed with time however the notion of yet another Spider-Man saga this soon does seem hasty and I wish that the good people--or at any rate the patent lawyers--at Marvel Comics could at least have taken the opportunity to elide the intensely annoying hyphen in the title. Or does merely suggesting such a change make me a total ass-hole? Our hero Peter Parker is played by Andrew Garfield--Tobey Maguire the previous incumbent having reached the unthinkable age of thirty-seven. Garfield was excellent as the hapless Eduardo Saverin in ""The Social Network"" and he still bears the mournful traces of a smart kid who had to agree to an out-of-court settlement. If anything he is rather too mournful. I know that years of sappy cinema have left me lachrymose-intolerant but I really couldnt understand why Garfields Bambi eyes kept glinting with a mist of tears. Peter lives in Queens with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). His closest friend is a skateboard which I guess is a step up from Mark Zuckerberg. As befits so many superheroes-in-waiting Peter is bullied and if we never entirely shake off the sense that we are witnessing a complex two-hundred-million-dollar revenge of the nerd that also is a defining strain of the genre. At school to his baffled delight Peter gets to know Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone)--a classmate allegedly seventeen years old although for a while I was under the distinct impression that despite her thigh-high socks she was actually a teacher. Here once more is a calculated nod to the daydreams of a junior audience. Stone is twenty-three a wise veteran of ""Easy A"" and ""The Help"" but as Gwen she has to suffer a faintly demeaning reversion to virginal youth. And so to the pudding of the plot. Peter makes contact with a one-armed colleague of his fathers Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) whose status as a brilliant scientist is amply demonstrated by his white lab coat. ""Wonderful things are coming wonderful things"" he cries like someone in a wonky hat who has just opened a chocolate factory. Dr. Connors wants to cure all ills including his own disfigurement by melding one species with another and I had hoped that Ifans a very funny Welshman would use the same technique to splice his own personality onto the part but the films director Marc Webb does not permit such levity in his fiend. Accidentally with the aid of a magic serum Dr. Connors renders himself part lizard although the creepiest shot in the film is not of the beastly result--whose disappointingly blunt unlizardish head resembles that of Ben Grimm in ""The Fantastic Four""--but of the simple shadow that he casts like an approaching hunchback in the tunnel of a New York sewer. And the best line comes as Peter warns a police captain (Denis Leary) of who or what is coming ""He has transformed himself into a giant lizard"" Leary pauses with perfect timing and a face of stone then replies ""Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo?"" We need more zingers like that. Instead ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" adds its pennyworth to the scrawny ethical debate with which films of this kind like to pimp their own significance. Martin Sheen--who else?--gets to deliver the big speech about the responsibilities of the highly gifted. Meanwhile for the benefit of the lowly brained a company receptionist sees Peter looking for a visitors badge and asks ""Are you having trouble finding yourself?"" Its O.K. we get it. There remains nonetheless a conundrum that the film both provokes and dodges by what fickle criterion do some men when infused with genes from elsewhere in the animal kingdom become pleasingly enhanced humans while others turn into hideous mashups with awkward consequences for their sex lives? Why does Peter Parker grow into a paragon of fortitude clad in upmarket cycling gear while Dr. Connors or Jeff Goldblums fast-talking goof in ""The Fly"" submits to dermatological outrages that no amount of cleanser mousse can soothe? If Webb had had the guts to pursue the truly inventive and the biologically accurate Peter would not have surprised Gwen at her bedroom window or shared a dreamy kiss. He would have crawled out of her drain and been beaten to death with a mop. The climax occurs on the pointed peak of a high-rise as if all that any film required in the bid to top its predecessors was to scrape the edge of the sky. But that site like the summit of Everest is surely crowded to the full by creatures from other films--everything from King Kong to Susan Sarandons majestic dragon in ""Enchanted"" who was far more sinuous witty and purple than anything Dr. Connors could devise. Spider-Man himself wounded in the leg hitches a ride on a succession of huge cranes in a scene that even the most muscular of Soviet realists would have considered risible Heroic crane operators of the world unite Bring down the slavering reptile of capitalism By now ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is running out of nimbleness and fun and the promise contained in its title seems ever more tendentious. There are joyous moments when we share Peters point of aerial view through a sort of private Spidey-Cam as he loops and soars through town and there is one sequence early on that clangs with possibility as Peter--endowed with powers that he cant yet control--manages to trash a subway car along with most of its inhabitants. Sadly the implications of that spree are toyed with and cast aside. What a shame; the idea that to be rendered superhuman is neither some sombre moral privilege nor a queasy Faustian temptation but a prelude to ungovernable slapstick might be just what the genre needs. It would definitely tickle the new batch of ten-year-olds receiving their first hit of arachnomania. So what will they have learned from this instructive film? One thing if you want to grab a girl as Peter does you eject a strand of sticky stuff onto her from behind then pull. Not true kids. Dont try it at home. Can the human soul be stirred by hearing the Buggles? They are best known--or simply known--for their 1979 single ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" which became the first music video ever played on MTV in 1981. It came from their aptly named album ""The Age of Plastic"" and there you might think it should have stayed. Yet here it is again halfway through Sarah Polleys new movie ""Take This Waltz"" blaring out over the Scrambler ride at the Centreville amusement park in Toronto. We focus on two scramblees Margot (Michelle Williams) and her neighbor Daniel (Luke Kirby) as they whip and whirl around and fall in love; how Polley conveys this through all the noise I dont know but she does. As the song stops abruptly and the lights grow dim and dusty and some fat guy in long shot ushers them out of their pod it feels like the end of the world. These two are completely Buggled. Would that everything in the film which charts this passion of Margots and the deflation of her marriage to Lou (Seth Rogen) delivered so natural a shock. Polley has a wonderful eye not least for the waves of worry that pass over peoples faces and she gets as much from Williams as she did from a radiant Julie Christie in ""Away From Her"" (2007). So rich is that visual yield however that it needs no verbal boost. Yet from the moment that Margot says to Daniel while sitting next to him on a plane ""Im afraid of connections"" the dialogue strains and grunts so hard for effect that it threatens to pull a muscle. Your best option perhaps is to zone out from the implausible kinks in the setup--husband and wife seem to live a pretty fancy life for instance given that she is a non-writing writer and he creates recipes based exclusively on chicken. This will leave you free to savor the compositions and the melted-candy color schemes which have far more kick and spice than Lous cacciatore. From the early closeup of turquoise toenails to the serene tableau of women of every age and outline showering and chatting after a swim Polley shows that her real theme her obsession almost is the body in time--how it tenses and eases whether in the course of decades or in a single camera-encircled rondeau of sex. Few of us would go as far as Geraldine (Sarah Silverman) Lous sister with her cheerful claim ""I look in the mirror I want to fuck myself"" but you know what she means. And you know it cant last.

Ten years later Maguire and his director Sam Raimi have parted ways with ""Spider-Mans"" parent studio Columbia Pictures and now the corporate overlords are asking audiences for a do-over. Back to one as the filmmaking phrase goes and Action. And there is plenty of action in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" in which the British actor Andrew Garfield plays high school student Peter Parker and Emma Stone plays his adored-from-afar crush Gwen Stacy (Peters original pre-Mary Jane squeeze). The good news is that Garfield and Stone whip up a warm convincing froth as two teenagers caught up in a beguiling case of puppy love. The not-so-great news is that by ""reboot"" the studio means taking audiences once again through every step of Peters transformation into Spider-Man including the fateful mutant spider bite an equally pivotal incident involving his beloved Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and those first wobbly forays discovering his superhuman powers of strength and agility and the ability to shoot bolts of monofilament to encase malefactors in sticky Saran-Wrap cocoons. The result is that for its first hour (and sorry to say there is a first hour to this almost 2 1/2-hour tushie tingler) ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" subjects viewers to an origin story that they either already know or will find soporifically drab and draggy. Much of the background material is conveyed in a mind-numbing tour of the Manhattan labs at the genetic research company OsCorp where a kindly scientist named Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) is trying to find a regenerative formula on behalf of an unseen owner. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" has been filmed in crisp attractive IMAX 3-D but no amount of on-screen graphics or depth-of-field tricks can make up for a drearily dry lecture in speculative science. Thankfully things pick up considerably once Peter dons the famous skin-tight spandex suit first as an urban avenger on a personal mission then doing battle with a green-scaled yellow-clawed super-monster called appropriately the Lizard. Meanwhile hes being tracked with mounting concern by a New York police captain who as portrayed by the dryly funny Denis Leary delivers the few genuinely funny lines in ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" When discussing the various options of dealing with the rock em sock em lizard king thats laying waste to Manhattan he deadpans ""Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo to you?"" Marc Webb best known for directing the inventive indie rom-com ""(500) Days of Summer"" again proves adept at capturing the emotional currents between characters especially the young and love-struck Peter and Gwen. And he handles the action sequences with clarity and graceful pacing especially when Spidey is whooshing over Sixth Avenue with a gorgeously choreographed assist from a squadron of friendly crane operators. (Still ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" suffers from its share of overkill not only in its running time but in James Horners bombastic assaultive musical score. Enough already.) Primarily though ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" serves as something of an audience audition for Garfield who delivers a more recessive withholding performance than Maguire but whose lithe rangy physique aptly lends itself to his characters arachnidan alter-ego. With his soulful brown eyes and mop of untamed hair Garfield is winningly believable as a shy nerdy outcast - and just as credible as the scrambling preternaturally limber superhero who saves the day. Although fans of Maguire and Raimis Spider-Man movies may find themselves wondering if they really need such an exhaustive refresher theyll also no doubt accept Garfield as the latest iteration of one of Marvel Comics most iconic figures. Now that all the fussy exposition has been taken care of the real fun can begin in earnest Long may he weave. Contains sequences of action and violence.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Emo Spider-Man"" wouldnt pop on posters but it would be honest. This reboot of the Marvel franchise is a downshift from the Tobey Maguire-Sam Raimi trilogy. It has less action humor imagination and vitality no Danny Elfman music no classic lines like ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and tragically no J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. In the unlikely hands of indie romcom director Marc Webb (""(500) Days of Summer"") it has more arguments and hugs and sulks and tears and lovelorn teens. It is ""The Notebook"" in Spandex. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is not quite so bad that you want to knock it off the screen and beat it to death with a broom but its hard to imagine many fans being drawn into its web. The long-running James Bond series doesnt feel the need to retell 007s origin story every time a new actor steps into the role but this yarn returns to Peter Parkers fateful bite by a science-lab superspider the death of his guardian Uncle Ben and his first big crush (its early girlfriend Gwen Stacy not Mary Jane Watson this time). As a wise man once said yadda-yadda-yadda. Movie people we know who Spider-Man is. You know we already know who he is. He is a cultural icon. That is the reason you made a movie about him. Do not asphyxiate us with needless exposition. This Peter (Andrew Garfield) is not the dweebish introvert of yore but a skateboarding do-gooder who reduces his usually calm and collected classmate Gwen (Emma Stone) to a puddle of blushing giggles. Denis Leary plays Gwens father a glowering growling New York City police captain peeved at Spider-Man for his vigilante raids on street thugs which have knocked a carefully planned sting operation for a loop. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sequences of action and violence. Peter and Gwen share a web-propelled tour of nighttime Manhattan. What looked genuinely romantic in ""Superman"" looks like a yo-yoing recipe for motion sickness here. Director Webb doesnt have the kinetic imagination necessary to put his own stamp on these action sequences which look like extra-synthetic computer-generated animation. Hoping to uncover information about his long-vanished parents Peter contacts his fathers fellow research scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) the necessary villain. An amputee obsessed by the limb-regenerating abilities of reptiles he has developed a serum that he hopes will restore his lost right arm. Unaware of the tradition demanding that scientists who test their own chemical inventions become psychotic he transforms into the Lizard the least convincing comic bruiser since Ang Lees Gumby-style Hulk. He creates a lab in the citys sewer system where there is apparently an abundant supply of electricity. Using his serum as a bio-weapon he will turn all of Manhattan into cold-blooded predators if that isnt redundant. Theres a battle between Spidey and Lizzy on the gridlocked Williamsburg Bridge but a curious lack of crowd scene tumult. I guess these are just jaded New Yorkers who dont run from their cars screaming at the sight of a 12-foot man-iguana. There are not one but two countdowns to doom with a helpful recorded voice calmly ticking off the seconds. The only suspense is how much time we have to kill before the sweet relief of the closing credits. This ""Spider-Man"" is a puny offering beside the thunderously entertaining ""Avengers."" With great stories come great responsibilities. This one doesnt measure up.

Starring Andrew Garfield Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans. Directed by Marc Webb. (PG-13. 136 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Spider-Man is back again. Hes young again. Hes discovering love realizing his powers and this time hes doing it in three dimensions and if you like in Imax. His girlfriend used to be Kirsten Dunst. Now its Emma Stone. He used to be shorter and have lighter hair. Now hes Andrew Garfield. Hes doing well. First the bottom line then well fill in the details ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a good Spider-Man movie. A case could be made - it could be made here and with enthusiasm - that this is not exactly a story that needs to be told no not again. But the story has been told; the movie is here and the movie before us is a lot better than it has a right to be. Its generally best to talk about films on their own terms without comparing them to other pictures. But ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" might be the one exception. People want to know if the new movie is better or worse than the previous ""Spider-Man"" entries and the answer to that question is yes and no but mostly yes. Or to put it another way this is the second-best Spider-Man movie yet made. In the previous trilogy only ""Spider-Man 2"" surpasses it. The new movie benefits from recent strides in computer graphics so that now finally when Spider-Man swings from building to building he no longer looks like a little stick figure bobbing up and down on a computer screen. The effects are convincing in both long and medium shot such that you stop thinking of them as effects and start reacting to them getting weak-kneed as Spider-Man teeters from the edge of skyscrapers. This is also a rare recent example of a 3-D movie that makes good use of three dimensions. As Peter Parker the high school student whose career begins when he is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider Garfield is not nearly as charming or as idiosyncratic as Tobey Maguire. But Maguires reflective quality often rendered him passive. Garfield a good actor has a prickly ruffled undertone that makes him by nature more active more angry and more suited to prowling the streets at night. Its easier to believe in his anger. The new movie delves a bit further into the backstory. One night years in the past Peters parents need to leave town in a hurry so they drop him off at the aunt and uncles house and never come back. Peter ends up with Martin Sheen as a surrogate dad - winning - with Sally Field in effect fulfilling motherly duties. Fields role doesnt amount to much besides fretting though she can fret with the best of them but Sheen gets to land Uncle Ben as the fundamental pillar of Peters moral decency. This time around the filmmakers seem a little more serious about sticking to the original source the comic books by Stan Lee and so Stone doesnt play Mary Jane (as did Dunst) but Gwen who was Peters high school girlfriend. No one will improve on Dunst but Stone brings some of the same wise kindness and humor to her role and so Peter is in good hands. Part of the fun of any first Spider-Man installment is in waiting for Peter to recognize his newfound Spider-Man abilities and yet the revelation scene in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is a disappointment. Its just a rather drab interlude on a New York subway car which Peter accidentally demolishes. In this scene and others first-time feature director Marc Webb has too much of a tendency to film action scenes with a series of tight close-ups. But there really is no arguing with the story which is grand scale without losing the human scale. I hesitate to mention the villain of the piece because I wasnt sure for half the film who the villain would turn out to be. Suffice it to say there are nuances to the villainy here worthy of a good comic book and not a bad cartoon even if the stakes are as extreme as the possible destruction of New York City and the genetic corruption of the human species. Denis Leary who has made a good career out of grumpiness plays Gwens dad the New York City police chief and hes exactly the right kind of unsmiling guy that no teenage boy would want as his girlfriends father. Hes scary enough without adding in the fact that he is convinced that Spider-Man is a social menace and must be stopped. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Liam Lacey From Mondays Globe and Mail (includes correction) Published Monday Jul. 02 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Jul. 02 2012 1050AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Marc Webb Written by James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves Starring Andrew Garfield Emma Stone and Rhys Ifans Classification PG Genre action Year 2012 Country USA Language English More honourable than ""amazing"" the latest reboot of the Spider-man franchise brings Marvel Comics web-slinging super-hero down to earth in a mostly satisfactory way. Benefiting largely from the twitchy cerebral English actor Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) the new film directed by Marc Webb ( [500] Days of Summer) is less a wish-fulfilment story than an emotional coming-of-age story. In the first and best half the film focuses on high school science geek Peter Parker as he comes to terms with his anger and parent issues and finds a soul-mate. Andrew Garfield is the latest actor to play Spider-Man on the big screen. AP Movies Video Latest Spider-Man swings into Hollywood Andrew Garfield image for AP video. AP Movies Video Andrew Garfield on being a Spider-Man fan The first Spider-Man which concluded with Spider-Man in front of an American flag seemed to reclaim the air space of Manhattan after the 9/11 attacks from eight months before. The new film is literally more earth-bound The early action sequences are less about flight than the French obstacle-course sport of parkour with its emphasis on vaulting rolling running jumping and hand-to-hand combat. The script reverts to Stan Lees original conception of Spider-Man as a precocious scientist who invents the super-strong web material from which he swings rather than having it spontaneously eject from his palms.Why another origin story so soon? The obvious reason is that the Spider-Man franchise has has made more than 2.5-billion to date Sony will lose rights to the Marvel Comic franchise if it doesnt keep producing movies and the 3-D ticket premium cant hurt. From a fans perspective the Spider-Man franchise had lost its momentum by Spider-Man 3 (2007) and reinventing stories is a common practice in the comic book world where retroactive continuity or ""retcon"" is a handy way to tie up loose ends and set up new sequels. In the current film for example the script finds a common cause for Parkers transformation into Spider-Man and that of his eventual enemy Oscorp employee Dr. Curt Conners a.k.a. the Lizard (Rhys Ifans) who was once a friend of Peters father.The focused script (the writers include Zodiacs James Vanderbilt Harry Potter writer Steve Kloves and Alvin Sargent who worked with Sam Raimi) written with the Star Wars mythological template in mind takes pains to show that Parkers transformation was brought about as much by his personal identity quest as by a random spider bite. Years ago his father and mother mysteriously disappeared in the night when he was a toddler leaving him in the care of his aunt and uncle (Sally Fields and Martin Sheen). Its when he goes looking for information about his father that he ends up at the Oscorp laboratory where he gets his fateful bite.Peter never even makes it to college here though his specialized science high school seems populated by students who look as though theyve been held back for a decade. The red-haired Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst in the earlier film) is nowhere to be found replaced by the perky Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) a fellow science whiz and daughter of brusque police chief (Denis Leary). Nor is Peter really ever much of a kid. His new-found powers provide some brief scenes of physical comedy but little elation for this brooding teenager. When he embarrasses a school bully he revels in it a bit too much. After his Uncle Ben is killed by a carjacker Peter now has a legitimate channel for long-repressed rage.The choice of the relatively inexperienced director Marc Webb (still in his thirties) offers pluses and minuses He seems less saturated in comic-book culture than Raimi and a far less fluid visual stylist. But theres an obvious pay-off in the films emphasis on a smart romance. Both in his gangly appearance and stammering style Garfield is reminiscent of a young Tony Perkins shy but not entirely innocent. Here Stones character is not just a dream girl but a catalyst for his awakening human potential. While he stumbles and stutters in her presence her gaze is almost maternal and encouraging and its his pent-up intensity more than his heroism that appeals to her.The movies action-heavy second half is more of a mixed bag with relatively clean action polished but conventional visual effects and a typically over-emphatic score by James Horner. The supporting cast is adequate with Ifans as the scientist who turns into a giant destructive lizard thankfully underplaying the villainy. When he transforms into a big green lizard like a cross between the Incredible Hulk and Godzilla he grows tiresome particularly because he wont shut up.One key action sequence in which Spider-Man rescues a toddler encapsulates the films lesson-conscious thrills. The boy is in a burning car which is hanging by a (spider) thread from a bridge when Spider-Man persuades the child to put on his mask to find the courage to climb to safety. While the sequence is there for the raised heartbeats its really about Parkers new ability to see himself in others rather than his derring-do.Editors Note Marc Webb is the director of the The Amazing Spider-Man and he is in his thirties.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 2 2012 Save for later Saved Amazing Spider-Man star Andrew Garfield is a more surly Peter Parker than former franchise star Tobey Maguire. Jaimie Trueblood/Columbia Sony Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Since Tobey Maguire didnt want to appear in another ""Spider-Man"" movie welcome to ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" starring Andrew Garfield in what Marvel is rather disingenuously calling a ""reboot."" There isnt any particular reason besides the obvious commercial one why we needed to re-up this franchise. Still it could have been worse. Fanboys will flock.Less blatantly comic bookish than Sam Raimis 2002 ""Spider-Man"" and shot in 3-D IMAX this latest arachnid in Marvels cinematic terrarium fills in the back story of the pre-Spidey Peter Parker placing heavy emphasis on his orphan status.Raised by his kindly aunt and uncle (Sally Field and Martin Sheen) after his parents mysteriously vamoosed in the dead of night Peter is a superbright supernerd who ends up infiltrating the scary headquarters of cross-breed citadel OsCorp where hes bitten by a spider and things rapidly become stickier and stickier. OsCorps chief scientist Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) was once partnered with Peters dad (Campbell Scott) and the overhanging question - is he a good guy or a bad guy? - is sort of answered when he morphs into his Lizard Man alter ego. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time From a strictly CGI perspective Lizard Man is kind of cheesy and his punch-outs with Spider-Man that occupy a large swath of the films second half are nothing special. What makes this film work is the human or quasi-human touches. Garfield is a very different Peter Parker. Maguire played the role too insularly I thought and even though his dweebishness may have helped him connect with his fanboy audience he wasnt a terribly exciting presence even when he leapt into costumed action. The 50 best movies of all time Video The Amazing Spiderman trailer Monitor Movie Guide Garfield by contrast is surly and rebellious and twitchy (he reminded me a little of the young Anthony Perkins) and this contrasts smartly with his high school sweetie Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) who is all smiles and wiles. Director Marc Webb working from a script by James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves wisely keeps this duo front and center although kids expecting nonstop action from the get-go are going to be disappointed. The whiz-bang stuff doesnt kick in until the Peter-Gwen relationship (which is the best thing in the movie) is firmly established.An end-credits kicker sets up the sequel - the re-re-boot? Here we go again. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for sequences of action and violence.)

Comments The Amazing Spider-Man Video Rated PG-13  138 minutes  2012 If youve seen Andrew Garfield in the British dramas Boy A or Red Riding 1974 you know hes a moodier more turbulent presence than gee-whiz Tobey Maguire who starred in the first three Spider-Man blockbusters. This fourth installment is a complete reboot returning to the web-slingers creation story and Garfield more than any other factor contributes to the sense of a darker vision along the lines of The Dark Knight. Aside from him--and perhaps Emma Stone an edgier love interest here than Kirsten Dunst in the previous installments--this is a virtual remake of Spider-Man (2002) highly entertaining though superfluous even by the standards of a comic book movie. Marc Webb ((500) Days of Summer) directed a cast that includes Rhys Ifans Denis Leary Irrfan Khan and as the heros good-hearted aunt and uncle Sally Field and Martin Sheen. By J.R.

Even if their third installment had less zing in its swing it seemed unseemly for Columbia Pictures to reboot the franchise so soon like those people who finish a remodel on their home and then start another a year later. Obviously Columbia is greedy but cant we just enjoy what we already have? Marc Webbs ebullient satisfying The Amazing Spider-Man might leave you with a new attitude about crime-fighting superheroes; it certainly did so for me. Theyre becoming like venerable Broadway plays trotted out with different casts and directors on different occasions proving themselves surprisingly flexible to new ideas new stars. You dont say ""Oh Ive already seen Death of a Salesman."" You say ""Philip Seymour Hoffman as Willy Loman? Ill bite."" (Provided you had the chance while it lasted.) It so happens that Andrew Garfield the new Spider-Man played Biff to Hoffmans Willy in Mike Nichols Death of a Salesman this spring and got great notices. He deserves more of the same for his Peter Parker. The character is young a senior at Midtown Science High School and stays the same age throughout. The bony almost bulbous-nosed Garfield (Never Let Me Go The Social Network) is 28 in real life a bit old for high school but between the lanky physique and puff of hair he manages a credible teen. He does very well with Peters goober tendencies as well as the tenderness Peter feels toward Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen). This Spider-Man is full of moist sincerity; hes always tearing up. But Garfield has the edge on Maguire in terms of Peters sex appeal which grows apace -- along with his sarcasm -- with each street fight won and building scaled. That famous Dunst-Maguire kiss? The Amazing Spider-Man has one just as good between Peter and his pre-Mary Jane love high school classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone of The Help and Easy A). Gwen is beautiful brilliant (she interns at Oscorp) and the daughter of police captain George Stacy (Denis Leary). (MORE Never Let Me Go Review Everlasting Love) A Marvel obsessive may take exception over the way the fleet of screenwriters including Harry Potter stalwart Steve Kloves have handled the story. The Amazing Spider-Man is neither a pure return to the source material nor a prequel to the Raimi narrative; it wavers somewhere in between. It helps to be forgetful (which comic-book fans dont tend to be). I didnt rewatch the first Raimi film until after Id seen Webbs -- (500) Days of Summer is the only other film hes directed -- and the sum of my memory of it had faded to Fun Good kiss Cute Tobey Good swinging But even so when the new Uncle Ben goes down in the street and the light leaves Martin Sheens eyes all I could think was How many more times are we going to see this old mans blood run on the pavement? The Amazing Spider-Man covers Peters bite and subsequent transformation in greater detail playing off his bafflement about it to fine effect as well as his dawning realization that being part spider is awesome. Theres a nifty scene on a subway car with Peter apologizing left and right as he discovers his new strength and the challenges of having organic Velcro on his fingertips (he yanks off a womans top). How would it be to go from geeky teen who cant get a date to someone who can move like Mikhail Baryshnikov at warp speed? Thrilling and thats what it looks like. None of this is new to us but Garfield and Webb make it feel convincingly fresh and exciting. (MORE Before Emma Stone Was Famous She Was Almost a Partridge) The main narrative difference other than his youth and love interest is that Peter is more focused on the absence of his parents Richard (Campbell Scott) and Mary Parker (Embeth Davidtz) who leave him with Aunt May and Uncle Ben in a prologue and then die in a plane crash. As a teen Peter finds some of his fathers old files from Oscorp and pays a fateful visit to Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) his fathers former colleague and best friend although it turns out not a very loyal one. ""He never even called"" spits Uncle Ben. (That backstory clearly awaits us in The Even More Amazing Spider-Man should the box office respond to this one.) Sheen is just right as Uncle Ben and Field is good too as Aunt May although I found her youthful mane of dark cascading curls distracting. Im not used to Aunt May (or Field) seeming hot. (MORE Why The Amazing Spider-Man Cant Catch a Break) Like Norman Osborn Dr. Connors dabbles in his own genetically engineered serums which restore a missing arm (plus) but turn him into a lizard (negative). Ifans handles the furtive aspect of pre-lizard Dr. Connors nicely but when he goes reptilian the man and villain hardly seem connected unlike Willem Dafoes Green Goblin who always seemed like an adjunct of Norman. Also even in 3-D I found the lizard version of Dr. Connors mechanical and fake straight out of a B movie. I appreciated Captain Stacys withering comment to Peter mid-lizard-denial ""Do I look like the mayor of Tokyo to you?"" Nearly as many sparks fly between Peter and the cop as they do between Peter and Gwen. For their first date Gwen invites her classmate to share a special dinner with the family. ""Were having branzino"" she promises. This trendy fish is often served whole on the plate. I think from the teasing way Gwen repeatedly says ""branzino"" to Peter that she finds both her mothers culinary reaching and Peters cluelessness about the treat hes being offered amusing. They lob the word back and forth flirtatiously which is weird and yet delightful. (MORE Easy A We  Emma Stone) Garfield and Stone have serious chemistry (theyre dating in real life). Maybe its partly Stones husky Bacall-like voice but their dialogue has an old-fashioned feel to it -- two smart kids sparring with occasional pauses to kiss. Theyre intellectual equals (shes first in her class; hes second according to Gwen) but shes still swayed by that physical-power business. ""Im going to throw you out the window now"" Spider-Man tells her during a fight sequence and when he does and she lands safely on the ground youd think from the look on Gwens face that hed said ""Im going to peel your clothes off now"" and done it. I look forward to seeing more of them together and I suspect audiences will too. The Amazing Spider-Man has a little more than two weeks in theaters to prove itself before The Dark Knight Rises. Speaking of it may seem unfathomable now but someday in the not-so-distant future someone will replace Christian Bale. Blasphemy or economic reality? The latter. And well all be just fine.

Columbia Pictures Andrew Garfield stars in Columbia Pictures The Amazing Spider-Man Photo by Jaimie Trueblood. Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. All Rights Reserved. Spider-Man is the most beloved character in comic books because behind the mask and the swagger theres Peter Parker a sympathetic teen with girl troubles and family issues.The recent Spider-Man trilogy directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire dutifully included the origin story about a boy who gets infected by a radioactive spider but then the series grew freakishly large. By the multivillain spectacular ""Spider-Man 3"" the beating heart of the archetypal story had been squashed like a bug.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" directed by Marc Web and starring Andrew Garfield is not just a reboot -- its a rejuvenation. From the first image of sensory awakening to the final acceptance of adult responsibility it pulses with the warm blood of a very human hero. Under circumstances that cry out for a sequel Peter (Garfield) is abandoned by his scientist parents at age 7. He is raised in suburban New York City by his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (manly-wise Martin Sheen).Peter is a budding photographer who is bullied by star athlete Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka resurrecting memories of the obnoxious jocks in John Hughes movies) yet protected by Flashs brainy girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone).Peter learns that his father partnered with Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) at Oscorp and he talks his way into the companys genetics lab -- where Gwen is a volunteer and Dr. Connors believes he can re-grow his missing arm with the formula that Peters father hid. This astutely art-directed movie is uncommonly smart about science and technology but after nosy Peter is accidentally exposed to spider DNA and morphs into a web-spinning superhero it really soars. His mastering of the physical and technical skills is thrilling as the skateboarding dynamo becomes a magnet for moral conflict and must make a literal leap of faith to accept his powers.Weve heard a billion times that with great power comes great responsibility but this new version of an old story amplifies both the power and the responsibility -- and then streams the Shakespearean drama through a teenagers headphones. While costumed vigilante Peter is heading for a showdown with Dr. Connors reptilian villain he is also shyly romancing Gwen under the disapproving eyes of her cop father (Denis Leary). With Garfield getting high marks for his American accent and adolescent demeanor the breathless young-love subplot deserves comparisons to Webbs work in ""(500) Days of Summer."" And the sensitive sophomore director keeps the action sequences coherent and human-scaled instead of chaotic and hardware-centric. To face demanding fans and hand them this valentine is more than amazing its heroic.The Amazing Spider-ManFour stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 216  Content Sequences of action and violence A rebooted superhero returns to his roots Director Marc Webb focuses on characters in The Amazing Spider-Man.

"Amazing Spider-Man movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs A quick turnaround for The Amazing Spider-Man ???Tobey Maguires Spider-Man feels like just yesterday and yet Andrew Garfield makes the character his ownJune 29 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticWhen a new actor slips on the Spandex for a superhero franchise reboot we should you know notice. And we do with Andrew Garfield who plays Peter Parker in director Marc Webbs""The Amazing Spider-Man.""Garfield served as the skeptical conscience of ""The Social Network""as Mark Zuckerbergs fellow Harvard student Eduardo Saverin and here anchoring his first franchise outing he represents a significant change from Tobey Maguire who played Parker/Spidey in the three ""Spider-Man"" films spanning the years 2002-2007. Maguire was all wide-eyed astonishment cut with a blase comic delivery of the lighter material. Garfield by contrast is pure adolescent angst (though hes nearly 30) more openly emotional and James Dean-y. Hes a rebel with a cause and ultralight ultra-thin metal cable shooting out of his wrists.And hes very good. The nerve-racking duality of his characters situation -- abruptly and mysteriously disappearing parents; a serious mid-film loss of a loved one; warring responsibilities as both ordinary citizen and extraordinary crime-fighter -- is all there in Garfields face and body language the behind-the-beat reactions when hes with the girl he loves (Emma Stone) the open-mouthed half-grin when figuring out his next move. TheSpider-Man guise gives this jangling bundle of loose ends a purpose and physical grace.So here we go again. Director Webb whose previous film was ""(500) Days of Summer""has a clean-lined script credited to James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves that clears away the clutter of the last ""Spider-Man"" installment from 07. (The best of the Sam Raimi pictures by far was No. 2 the one with Alfred Molina as Doc Ock.) Here the storytelling carries the virtue of simplicity and a lack of camp. Peter squares off with the genetic expert associate (Rhys Ifans) of Peters now-missing father (Campbell Scott). Dr. Connors who gave up his right arm in the name of science transforms into The Lizard a character from the early 60s ""Spider-Man"" comics. Martin Sheen and Sally Field ease comfortably into the roles of Peters aunt and uncle.This is not a film of stunning set pieces which isnt to say Webb hasnt delivered a good ""Spider-Man."" He has. For better or worse (at the box office that is) its actually interested in character and to some degree to the degree the Marvel franchise machinery will allow things like pacing and rhythm (though it feels a bit long). Im not sure about the way the Lizard is handled here as a terrifying digital mini-zilla who periodically turns ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" into a full-on horror movie. But when he gets the chance Ifans a fine and subtle actor works in the same confidential and privately suffering key as does Garfield.Is the interest in a new ""Spider-Man"" sky-high? Im speaking only for myself now Not really. It has been only five years since Maguire gave up the modified wrestlers mask. (How Peter Parker gets the notion for his Spidey persona specifically the headgear becomes a clever addition to the new film.) Five years isnt long enough to miss a crime-fighter. Similarly it seems as if ""Superman Returns"" (2006 of middling interest) just came and went and next year brings the arrival of the reboot ""Man of Steel.""Thats a lot of superheroic air traffic. Director Webb and Garfield cant do anything about that. All they can do is attempt to pull off the illusion that this is the first time weve seen this story.

BY Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Monday July 2 2012 1211 PM Title ""The Amazing Spider-Man Film Info With Andrew Garfield Emma Stone. Edgy reboot of popular franchise. Director Marc Webb (216). PG-13. Area theaters. With all due respect to the earlier films the web-slinging reboot ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" opening Tuesday should have come first. Director Marc Webbs action-adventure is grounded in a recognizable reality but is also full of thrills. Its dark and mysterious but doesnt skimp on fun. And in star Andrew Garfield theres actual power to Peter Parker usually seen as comicdoms superdork. The 28-year-old British actor brings to the role something like a 1970s-style grit. Back then actors including Al Pacino and Jon Voight were contenders to play Superman; in Garfield we see a bit of what that may have been like. The new tone is set early. When his scientist father suspects nefarious forces are nearby 7-year-old Peter is brought to his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) for safety. EMMA amp; ANDREW OPEN UP IN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH THE DAILY NEWS Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone get cozy atop the Empire State Building. (Bryan Smith for New York Daily News) Jaimie Trueblood/Columbia Pictures Andrew Garfield stars as Spider-Man/Peter Parker in Columbia Pictures ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" also starring Emma Stone. Mom and dad never return. Now a teen Peters a smart kid more into books than Facebook. He learns Oscorp Labs hired his dads former associate Dr. Curt Connors whom Peter hopes has knowledge about his parents. But Connors (Rhys Ifans) is doing strange things with science developing a reptile serum to regrow his missing arm and one of his steroidal spiders bites Peter. Columbia Pictures ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" starring Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. (Courtesy of CTMG./ImageMagick) We know the result and the transformation from man to Spider-Man is refreshingly free from the giddiness of previous versions. After Uncle Ben is shot during a robbery Peter turns masked vigilante. (The costume he creates looks handmade and stays that way while his webbing comes from wrist devices not his veins.) Yet Connors has changed too -- into a giant lizard with a human mind and voice (more about that later). He has used his serum on himself and as his reptilian side takes over he hatches a plan to turn all of N.Y.C. into scaly iguana-folk. Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield attend the 66th Annual Tony Awards at The Beacon Theatre on June 10 2012 in New York City. (Kevin Mazur/WireImage) No word on whether Jersey would be safe but police Capt. Stacy (Denis Leary) is more intent on catching Spider-Man while Stacys daughter Gwen (Emma Stone) attracts her classmate Peters attention and vice-versa. Their love story is sweet and mature and Stones smart self-possessed Gwen is a far cry from Kirsten Dunsts pouty Mary Jane in the earlier films. In fact so much of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is finely tuned -- including the trippy special effects nighttime atmosphere and full-throated emotions -- that the villains plot seems secondary. That has been a problem before even in the earlier series high point ""Spider-Man 2"" and this isnt the first comic-book film to suffer from a villain problem. For as good as Ifans is his CGI alter-ego feels like a ""Jurassic Park"" reject filled with ""Ill prove to them Im a genius""-style taunts. Its in these areas where the movie stumbles and despite the cool web-swinging and 3D-enhanced powers its almost unfortunate Webb has to build such Spider-Man stuff into his ""Spider-Man"" movie. So many things click -- including a great midfilm save of a car dangling off a bridge -- that the creature-feature fights seem like filler. Happily the missteps arent strong enough to kill this sharp reimagining. Ultimately the amazingly gripping parts of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" are what stick. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movie reviews Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Web sense Spider-Man for a new generation |       NJ.com comments Web sense Spider-Man for a new generation Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 02 2012 at 645 AM View/Post Comments Jaimie TruebloodAndrew Garfield and Emma Stone in ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" Superheroes lives are getting shorter. The first feature ""Superman"" series began in 1978 -- and it was 28 years before Hollywood felt it had to completely start all over again in 2006 with ""Superman Returns."" Tim Burtons ""Batman"" reclaimed the hero from serials and camp TV in 1989; it would be 16 years before Christopher Nolan rethought the Dark Knight for ""Batman Begins"" in 2005. Now weve got ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" -- a mere 10 years after the original ""Spider-Man."" And while thats not a record (that would probably go to the two ""Hulk"" movies made within five years of each other) it may be the start of a trend. Except this episode doesnt feel so much like a new twist on an old character as it does a souped-up version of the original film -- with better effects and a new villain and the same old hero swinging through the skyscrapers. And thats just fine. A decade ago ""Spider-Man"" served as a template for a new era of Marvel movies -- funny (but not farcical) authentic (but not geek-driven) and cast with good actors who took their jobs seriously. The new ""Amazing Spider-Man"" is smart enough to follow all those old rules -- but to add more eye candy too. Oh we get a little more background this time around on Peter Parkers parents and how he was orphaned. (A little too much background -- the film gets off to a slow start.) Gwen Stacy is the love interest rather than Mary Jane Watson and although Peter still has his camera hes no longer shooting for the Daily Bugle. Theres also a slight shift in the usual go-it-alone emphasis of superhero movies. In this one Spider-Man needs help from everyone -- Gwen the police even random New Yorkers. (His ""secret identity"" isnt so well-kept either -- by the end of the film it seems as if everybody except dear Aunt May has cottoned on to who he is.) But other than that this film basically follows the lead of the first going through the origin story (spider bite strange powers) the motivation (tragedy at home search for justice) a similar enemy (potential father figure turned twisted) and even tacking on the same noble ending (albeit a slightly softer one). Jaimie TruebloodThis rendition of ""Spider-Man"" provides more eye candy. So if you saw the first film a decade ago why run out to see this one now at probably twice the original ticket price? Well a few good reasons. The first is the effects. As much fun as the original ""Spider-Man"" was a decade ago even then the computer graphics were only so-so; scenes of the superhero swinging through Manhattans steel canyons looked slightly cartoonish. By now though the technology has finally caught up with our imaginations; this Spider-Man swings. The second is the actors. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were fine in the original film (and theres still nothing in this one to rival their iconic upside-down kiss). Yet Andrew Garfield brings a newly dark mumbling sarcasm; Emma Stone adds a whipsmart intelligence. And together they have an easy and convincing attraction (as they should -- they became a couple while making the film). The supporting actors add some spice too. Denis Leary is a fierce funny presence as Stones father (and as head of the police Garfields pursuer). And Rhys Ifans is an intriguing villain as the maimed messianic scientist who becomes the Lizard. So yes if you think youve seen this all before -- you have. Yet you havent seen it quite like this -- so shiny so spectacular so literally ""Amazing."" Because the new ""Spider-Man"" isnt just another faithful recreation of an old model. Like ""The Avengers"" its the creation of a new model for the next generation. Ratings note The film contains violence. The Amazing Spider-Man (PG-13) Columbia (136 min.) Directed by Marc Webb. With Andrew Garfield Emma Stone Rhys Ifans. Opening in New Jersey today at midnight.

But for all its underlying cynicism the new Spidey picture is pretty damn good. 66 Shares Share 56 Tweet 8 Share 1 Share Email Print Share Photo Courtesy of CTMG./ImageMagick Coming barely a decade after Sam Raimis first Spider-Man the ""reboot"" called The Amazing Spider-Man is clearly unnecessary and ought to be shunned for all kinds of reasons -- chiefly to deliver a shock to the system of Hollywood execs whose primary job is finding merchandisable ""franchises"" and studio ""tentpoles."" But for all its underlying cynicism the new Spidey picture is pretty damn good. The lesson should not be that lazy multiplex viewers and Comic-Con fanatics will pay to see anything with Marvels name on it but that first chapters -- a.k.a. ""origin stories"" -- are easier to make and more reliably fun. By the time part three of a blockbuster superhero saga rolls around the lead actors have aged out of their roles and are impatient to prove they can carry ""serious"" (i.e. Oscar-bait) movies while the filmmakers their edges blunted by too much money and unable to think about complex long-term story arcs the way TV creators can flop about in misery their brains grinding emptiness. Why not start the whole thing over with a younger hungrier less expensive crew? Im not making the case for a movie like The Amazing Spider-Man -- only saying its fresher than Raimi amp; Co.s shambolic Spider-Man 3. (No it cant touch Spider-Man 2 the best of all the Marvel pictures.) The new Peter Parker is Andrew Garfield the glowering dweeb from The Social Network and where Tobey Maguire was soft-faced and mild examining his sudden sticky excretions with an adolescents wonderment Garfield is high-strung and angry -- and those excretions dont come naturally. (This Peter has to build his web-jets.) Because a primal trauma must kick-start every superhero career weve seen little Peter lose his parents (Campbell Scott as his scientist dad Embeth Davidtz as his mom) in the prologue and high-school Peter beaten up by bullies. His powers emerge spasmodically twisting him in knots his body with a mind of its own. The problem with the first Spider-Man was that whenever Maguire got into his suit he transformed into a little video-game fellow swinging around an artificial cityscape fluidity trumping realism. Director Marc Webb makes the flights more jagged mixing up his angles and adding Spidey-eye views for the wheeee factor. At one point Peter channels Ratso Rizzo ""Im swingin here"" You dont get that weightless inhuman CGI vibe as powerfully. Like many superhero pictures The Amazing Spider-Man has more self-empowering messages than there are placards at a Maoist convention. A poster of Albert Einstein carries the banner ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" Peters uncle (Martin Sheen ever the voice of the liberal conscience) preaches moral responsibility -- the social good taking precedence over freedom of choice. Politics-shmolitics Americans now get most of their civic lessons from masked men in Spandex. A strikingly handsome Rhys Ifans plays the Jekyll/Hyde figure Dr. Curt Connors once Peters fathers best friend. Having only one arm he sits in his lab and stares longingly at lizards flitting around their aquaria losing their tails and growing them back with aplomb. Reptiles are the master race he concludes. Everyone should be turned into reptiles. His scheme doesnt make much sense but give it points for weirdness. The lizard metamorphoses mean theres so much CGI that the artists and programmers names are scrolling long after youve exited the restroom and headed for home. Ive saved the best for last The love interest played by that throaty redheaded (here blonde) darling Emma Stone whose blue eyes radiate so much intelligence that any actor on whom she trains them in adoration becomes an instant movie star. Lucky Garfield getting to play scenes like the one in which Peter tries to tell Stones Gwen Stacy what happened after a chemically mutated spider dropped down his shirt. ""Ive been bitten ... "" he stammers. ""So have I"" Stone says sighing and melting him with her gaze. CGI is superfluous. This story appeared in the July 21 2012 issue of New York Magazine.

"Amazing Spider-Man The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; amazing-spider-man-the ) Amazing Spider-Man The (United States 2012) July 02 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Where to go with Spider-Man? Thats the billion dollar question that has plagued Sony Pictures. One of their flagship franchises Spider-Man is a proven money-maker that could not be allowed to lie fallow simply because the creative engine ran out of fuel. One could argue that over the span of three pictures - 2002s Spider-Man 2004s Spider-Man 2 and 2007s Spider-Man 3 - Sam Raimi took the character as far as he could go. In fact the third film in that series might have been one too many. When it came time to develop a fourth installment Raimi departed over ""creative differences"" and Sony was left with a movie that needed to go forward but no driver behind the wheel. So they followed what has become an accepted approach in Hollywood when in doubt remake and reboot. So a mere ten years after Raimi brought one of Marvels most respected titles to the screen that vision has been scrapped for a modification. The Amazing Spider-Man isnt sufficiently different from the 2002 movie to make it interesting and it ignores two major seismic shifts that have rocked the superhero genre since then Nolans Batman trilogy and The Avengers. Both of those have made it almost impossible for something with the limited ambition and lazy writing of The Amazing Spider-Man to satisfy. Oh theres little doubt it will be deemed a success on a business level and die-hard fans of the comic book will probably respond favorably but theres something inherently depressing about what this movie says about the state of summer blockbusters in general and superhero movies in particular. Namely how can audiences respond to something that offers no more than a re-telling of a story we have seen done at least as well so recently? The Amazing Spider-Man provides a regurgitation of the title characters origin story as if we couldnt remember it from ten years ago. There was a simple elegance and charming naivetA(c) to the way Raimi presented the story. Yes the suspension of disbelief curve was high but thats a given with a superhero movie. Here the matter is complicated by sloppy screenwriting. In addition to swallowing the fact that a spider bite from a ""super spider"" can imbue Peter Parker with powers you have to accept that the guy is a master thief. After all he breaks into the inner sanctum of a top secret genetic research think tank with only a fake I.D. badge. Its random repeated acts of stupidity like this that damage the movies ability to establish its own fragile pseudo-reality. The viewer accepts a lot of impossibilities in a superhero movie but there are limits. Tobey Maguire has been replaced by Andrew Garfield. No big deal. With the mask on you dont notice the difference and Garfield is more convincing than Maguire as Peter. Okay Garfield is too old for the part (a 28-year old playing someone in high school) bringing up thoughts of Grease but Maguire was 26 when he put on the costume. Uncle Ben is now Martin Sheen instead of Cliff Robertson and thats an improvement. On the other hand its hard to imagine a worse casting gaffe than Sally Field as Aunt May. She may be Mrs. Gump but shes not Peters guardian. Sorry but its hard to beat Rosemary Harris (although I suppose shes too old by now). Mary Jane has been ditched as the love interest replaced by original comic book girlfriend Gwen Stacy. Hair color is the differentiating characteristic. Emma Stone like Garfield is too old for a high school kid but at least 23 is closer to believable. Stone and Garfield are supposedly an off-screen item which makes it odd that Maguire and Kirsten Dunst displayed better on-screen chemistry. The first half of The Amazing Spider-Man is almost a point-by-point remake of Spider-Man. Lets go through the checklist. Peter is shown to be a nerd in school. Check. Peter gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Check. Peter feels sick then wakes up with new powers. Check. Peter explores his new powers in selfish ways. Check. Uncle Ben gives Peter a lecture about how ""with great power comes great responsibility"" (although he doesnt use those exact words this time around). Check. Uncle Ben is murdered as a result of Peters inaction. Check. And so forth... Its a little like hearing an inelegant cover of a familiar song. The second half replicates the rhythms of Spider-Man with a different villain. This time its The Lizard (Rhys Ifans) instead of The Green Goblin. Theyre largely interchangeable and the final battle is different primarily because the special effects are better. Really though after having watched Spider-Man fight The Goblin Doctor Octopus Sandman and Venom what more can be done with these generic battles? As well executed as they are by director Marc Webb (making his tent-pole debut after previously helming 500 Days of Summer) theres a repetitive quality that is perhaps unavoidable. The Avengers changed the game when it comes to superhero smackdowns and because The Amazing Spider-Man is unable to ascend to that level the fight scenes seem a little quaint and one-dimensional. I wrote in my review of The Avengers that it ""raised the bar to a level where the more traditional approach of having a single superhero tangle with a supervillain or two may no longer be enough... When something has been dialed up to an 11 isnt there an inherent letdown to turning it back to a 7?"" A 7 may be generous where The Amazing Spider-Man is concerned. In all fairness to Webb most of The Amazing Spider-Mans flaws are not his doing - they come from the screenplay. His direction is assured and his handling of the special effects is smooth. He also shows a sure hand with the ""smaller"" scenes. The romance has its share of cute moments and there are some effective dramatic exchanges. The CGI is better here than in any of Raimis films although this is probably as much a result of improving technology than any other factor. One can see that given a better script Webb might have made this work. Might have. The Amazing Spider-Man was filmed in 3-D which means that the ugly conversion artifacts are absent. Nevertheless Webb doesnt use the format effectively. More than half the movie is presented in what amounts to 2-D with just a little background contouring. Take off the glasses if you dont believe me. The only time blurring and double-vision occurs is during the action sequences. This is the kind of movie where the surcharge is a rip-off. Theres no ""bang for the buck."" For all the things Webb does right in the technical department his use of 3-D leaves a lot to be desired. Another point worth mentioning relates to James Horners bombastic score which includes yet another instance of self-cannibalization. There is a five-second cue thats lifted directly from the composers music for Star Trek 2/Star Trek 3 without a single note having been changed. Talk about a way to take a person ""out of the moment."" This is even more egregious than the steals that occurred in Aliens and on that occasion Horner had an excuse (although we can argue about the validity of it). For me this is as deflating a movie as I have seen all year. Not the worst to be sure but a project so utterly unnecessary that it made me want to gnash my teeth in frustration. Rebooting Spider-Man while a questionable endeavor in its own right offered an opportunity to do something unique with the character. Take it to a place where it hasnt been. Accomplish for this franchise what Batman Begins did for Batman. Instead we get an unimaginative and lackadaisical repetition of the origin story with a pedestrian hero/villain battle at the end. The Transformers movies show more inventiveness. Now we have to wait two more years for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to hope the filmmakers can do something to revive a character whose pointless reboot has exposed all the weaknesses and none of the strengths in one of Marvels best-known superheroes.

A bite from a genetically altered spider kicks off his transformation but the desire for justice and the impetus for heroism came from seminal events in Peters personal life.STORY Garfield Stone Amazing togetherVIDEO Garfield a Spider-Man super fanMORE Spider-Man Moscow premiereIts not strictly a reboot or even a prequel to the first Spider-Man out in 2002. This version adds illuminating plot points improving on what has gone before.One of the major reasons it works so well is the gangly charm of Andrew Garfield in the lead role. Where Tobey Maguire in the original Spider-Man trilogy was earnest Garfields Spider-Man is whip-smart and likably cheeky with an undercurrent of teenage angst.And then theres the tale of young love. The casting of Garfield as Spidey and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is inspired. Hes appealingly awkward and boyishly handsome. Shes radiant and self-assured. Together they set off sparks. There are no forced theatrics no upside-down kisses just unadulterated chemistry.A scene in which Peter goes to Gwens house for dinner is wryly funny amid the realization that her father (Denis Leary) is the chief of police and Spidey is at the top of his most-wanted list.About the movieThe Amazing Spider-Man  out of fourStars Andrew Garfield Emma Stone Rhys Ifans Denis Leary Sally Field Martin Sheen Campbell Scott Director Marc Webb Distributor Columbia Pictures Rating PG-13 for sequences of action and violence Running time 2 hours 16 minutes Opens Monday night in select theaters and Tuesday nationwide This is a star-making turn for Garfield. With an impeccable American accent the British Garfield embodies the nerdy Parker the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses.Director Marc Webb showed how to weave a witty romance without resorting to cliche in the exhilaratingly clever (500) Days of Summer. His sensibility works well here. While Sam Raimi who directed the preceding Spider-Man trilogy had some great moves (and some misses) Webb has a more subtle style with more investment in the emotional arc of the characters. The film opens with an eerie flashback in which Peters father (Campbell Scott) finds his office ransacked. He and his wife pack up 7-year-old Peter and send him to live with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen).A decade later Peter finds his fathers briefcase and seeks to understand his parents disappearance. He tracks down Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) his dads partner who is working on regenerative studies for OsCorp. Peter sneaks into a research lab and gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Ifans brings humanity to the role of a kind scientist who becomes a lizard marauder.The climactic face-off between Spider-Man and The Lizard drags on too long and Spideys perilous leaps and dangles are not enhanced by the lackluster 3-D. His movements are more naturalistic and less kinetic than in Raimis movies but still captivating.Told winningly The Amazing Spider-Man is as much a coming-of-age story as a crime-fighting action saga.

"The Amazing Spider-Mans Peter and Gwen are super Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview The Amazing Spider-Mans Peter and Gwen are superThe new superhero movie is at its best with Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) but its too long and sometimes dips below amazing.July 02 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield in ""The Amazing Spider-Man."" (Jaimie Trueblood Columbia...)The unmistakable air of Hollywood calculation hangs over""The Amazing Spider-Man""but this isnt necessarily a bad thing. The studios wouldnt survive if they didnt make smart bets from time to time to balance their multiple bonehead maneuvers and this new superhero saga is a shrewd wager that mostly a but not entirely a pays off.The first piece of calculation was the determination that only a decade past the first ""Spider-Man""film and five years after ""Spider-Man3"" the world was ready for a complete reboot of the franchise starting the story from square one with Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker a.k.a. the Man and Emma Stone as First Girlfriend Gwen Stacy. Given the hundreds of millions that have been sunk into marketing that part of the bet will likely pay off.The second nervy maneuver was to hire Marc Webb whose only previous feature was the inexpensive indie romance""(500) Days of Summer""to helm a major summer tentpole with a budget estimated at 220 million.PHOTOS Andrew Garfield - Our Favorite VictimWhat executives remembered was that the relationship between stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst was a key factor in the 2.5 billion the three previous ""Spider-Man"" films earned. If Webb took care of business there a which he has a they could always surround him with canny Oscar-nominated veterans like cinematographer John Schwartzman and visual effects supervisor Jerome Chen a as well as four members of the stunt coordinating Armstrong family a to take care of the heavy lifting the major action sequences demand.Effective as that strategy is at times its de facto division of responsibility means that ""Spider-Man"" feels less directed with a consistent vision than simply cobbled together. What especially falls through the cracks are the nonromantic nonaction parts of the story which take up a healthy chunk of a movie that has been allowed to unreasonably bloat to 2 hours 18 minutes.The result is that ""Spider-Man"" goes in and out of focus. This is a film that is memorable in pieces but not as a whole doing enough right things in key areas to ensure box-office success but permitted to drift into earnest pokiness when the spotlight is not on.The best piece obviously is the relationship between Garfields Peter Parker and Stones Gwen Stacy. Not just because this is a strength of the director and the James Vanderbilt-Alvin Sargent-Steve Kloves screenplay but also because of the abilities of the actors in question.Though most American audiences know him only through a supporting role in""The Social Network""Garfield is indisputably one of Britains top young actors someone whose impressive skills are visible in such diverse films as ""Red Riding Trilogy""""Never Let Me Go""and ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus""not to mention an extraordinary Tony-nominated performance as the troubled Biff in the recent Broadway revival of""Death of a Salesman.""Having an actor of this high level of ability goes a long way toward making the implausible plausible and Garfield also brings an interesting whiff of James Dean-type teen anguish to the role of a young man whose parents up and disappeared when he was small.Because Garfield can be quite handsome in a brooding kind of outsider way the crush attractive Gwen Stacy has on her fellow classmate and ace photographer at New Yorks mythical Midtown Science High is plausible as well.Though her rA(c)sumA(c) tends toward lighter fare (""Easy A""""Crazy Stupid Love""""The Help"") Stone is gifted as well. So whether its getting to know each other getting romantic or fighting the villainous Lizard the times these two interact on screen are all theyre supposed to be.Before all that can happen however back we go into Peter Parkers past and watch as his brainy scientist dad (a cameo by Campbell Scott) disappears from his life leaving him to be raised by his kindly Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and even kindlier Aunt May (Sally Field).Things get more dramatic when Peter stumbles upon an old briefcase filled with perplexing scientific formulas which leads him to Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans very different from his wacky turn as roommate Spike in ""Notting Hill"") who turns out to be an old colleague of his dads.Dr. Connors as it happens is a top scientist at the all-powerful OsCorp firm working on cross-species genetics and hoping for ""a world without weakness."" What he ends up with is something else again.That visit to OsCorp also leads Peter to the celebrated spider bite that brings on unintended super powers and the scene on the subway ride home when he inadvertently discovers his expanded abilities is one of the films most amusing.Though the films conclusion is also appropriately rousing and contains ""Spider-Mans"" most impressive 3-D vistas it has to overcome the burden of that over-extended running time and the parallel tendency to treat Parkers story with excessive reverence.Even the Lizard heaven help him though effective in moments is not quite an opponent for the ages. Garfield and Stone are good enough to ensure that you wont miss their predecessors but you may well wonder where Doc Ock is now that we really need him.kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESAmazing Spider-Man 2 premiere slings a glitzy webApril 25 2014Amazing Spider-Man 2 Sparks fly amid tangled plot early...April 9 2014Amazing Spider-Man Andrew Garfield on making the fantasy...July 3 2012The Amazing Spider-Man hopes to sling 150 million by...July 2 2012Sonys new Spider-Man poised for amazing openingJune 20 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesBusinessNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-amazing-spiderman-20120702,0,6500728.story",200,theamazingspider-man30,theamazingspider-man,latimes

The Amazing Spider-Man Fair to good Director Marc Webb. Cast Andrew Garfield Emma Stone Rhys Ifans. Rating PG-13 for sequences of action and violence. Or maybe its too early. Maybe the genre hasnt cycled around to the place where a radical rethinking needs to be done (again). With ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" it doesnt really matter anyway. Director Marc Webb isnt reinventing anything here or even trying to. Hes simply telling a story. The important question to ask is whether he tells it well. Interview Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone And with the enormous help of Andrew Garfield in the lead role the answer is yes. It has been only 10 years since Sam Raimis first ""Spider-Man"" movie and five years since his third and last. So you can debate whether we needed another one so soon. Or you can simply enjoy the darker side Garfield brings to the character (he cries more than Speaker of the House John Boehner it seems like) and the chemistry he shares with Emma Stone as Peters girlfriend Gwen Stacy. The film begins with 4-year-old Peter Parker (Max Charles) playing hide-and-seek with his scientist father (Campbell Scott). Peter discovers that his fathers office has been broken into and immediately his parents pack up and flee leaving Peter in the care of Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). Peter now played by Garfield is still living with them by the time he gets to high school. Hes a smart kid but a bit of a nerd picked on by school bully Flash (Chris Zylka). One day he discovers an old photo of his father with a man he doesnt recognize; Uncle Ben tells him its Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who worked with Peters father. The two men had a breakthrough in genetic research before Peters father disappeared. Peter tracks Connors down to the lab where he is still working on a related project. Its while at the lab that Peter gets his famous bite from a mutated spider. It doesnt take long for him to notice a change; he inadvertently shows off his new powers on the subway ride home. Soon hes using them at school for a little revenge. Those familiar with Spider-Man lore will recognize parts of all this. Theyll also see coming the fate of Uncle Ben which plunges Peter into a life of crime fighting much to the chagrin of Capt. Stacy (Denis Leary) of the NYPD -- Gwens father -- who considers Spider-Man a criminal. All superhero stories demand a central villain and ""Spider-Man"" is no different. Its probably no secret thanks to trailers and gossip who that is but if you dont know thats a detail best discovered in the theater not here. Suffice it to say that the plot brings all of the major characters together by the end of the film. Webbs only previous feature was ""(500) Days of Summer."" It was a delightful film but hes not as inventive a director as Raimi; hes a bit clunkier and although the effects during action sequences are at times jaw-dropping sometimes its a little hard to follow. (This film wont do anything to advance the cause of 3-D either; mostly it just made some of the scenes look murky.) But he gets good performances out of everyone involved. The supporting cast is outstanding. Sheens Uncle Ben is unceasingly decent of course. Ifans always brings a hint of crazy to his characters a trait he gets to exercise more and more in this film as time goes on. Stone brings something more to the role of Gwen than just standard-issue superhero girlfriend; her Gwen is smart and independent. But Garfield is the essential ingredient here. Though his Peter clearly longs for his absent father the sheer joy that the discovery of his new powers brings him is infectious; its something both Garfield and Webb revel in. Peters goofy flirtations with Gwen are entertaining; his later more-mature encounters with her come off as genuine. Hes just a really good actor. So was another version of the story -- particularly one that hews so closely to the one previously told especially at the beginning -- really necessary? Of course not. But watching Garfield swinging through New York or toying with criminals after he captures them is reason enough to welcome another telling of the tale. Why make another ""Spider-Man""? Why not?

Ted To Rome With Love Turn Me On Dammit Tyler Perrys Madeas Witness Protection Opening Tuesday The Amazing Spider-Man The Amazing Spider-Man 3-D Without a doubt ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" wipes away the horrible aftertaste left by ""Spider-Man 3."" While thats welcome news theres a bigger question at hand Is this reboot featuring the beloved Peter Parker -- a guy we saw on the big screen just five years ago -- even necessary?Yes it is.In fact this is the best Spidey film yet strong bold and well-acted. Its main problem -- besides a bloated running time and only adequate 3-D -- is that you cant help but experience pangs of deja vu since director Sam Raimis very good ""Spider-Man"" debuted on the screen about 10 years ago. Fortunately the story and character show greater dimension here and theres a different love interest. While ""Spider-Man 3"" crammed in too much ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" takes a less-is-more approach and it pays off.The biggest ace up its sleeve is Andrew Garfield as the once-bitten teen who takes on arachnid superpowers. Best-known for nailing the part of Mark Zuckerbergs ex-chum Eduardo Saverin in ""The Social Network"" the gangly actor makes a moodier brainier Peter.While Tobey Maguire brought an endearing aw-shucks bewilderment to the role Garfield and screenwriters James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves go for a more angsty adolescent. Theres a cockier more teenlike quality to this Peter a skateboarder and photographer who lives with his uncle and aunt (well-played by Martin Sheen and Sally Field) and has a crush on the intelligent and perky Gwen (Emma Stone who lights up the screen as usual).Advertisement Parkers transformation into Spidey happens after he gets bitten while snooping around the lab of scientist Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans of ""Notting Hill"") -- his dead fathers former partner. The brilliant one-armed Connors is mixing and matching human and animal DNA in hopes of curing the world of its ills. Anyone who has ever picked up a comic book realizes this guys obsession can only lead to trouble. Boy does it ever. Once Peter attains his powers he has a hard time keeping them in check especially after a tragic crime is committed and he feels partly responsible. Seduced by his own strength Peter goes a touch too far turning the tables on a school bully.Its edgier themes like these when our hero shows that in his strength he possesses weakness that give this ""Spider-Man"" its bite. Dont go in thinking though that the filmmakers are pulling a ""Dark Knight."" Theres more gray than pitch black in play.Theres also less action than normal for a comic book flick. Director Marc Webb -- who gave us the spry romantic comedy ""500 Days of Summer"" -- hasnt completely forsaken the action but he does slow the pace so the plot can unfold and the relationships take root. Good for him since that helps the major characters come alive. The lizard villain played so impressively by Ifans winds up a complex combo of pathetic and sympathetic. And the NYPD police captain (Denis Leary) who also happens to be Gwens dad is given more to do as Spider-Mans vocal critic.Even the relationship between Peter and Gwen is more mature -- with Garfield and Stone providing romantic chemistry and simmering sexual energy.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" weaves in slightly riskier elements and even though the story is familiar its hard to not get drawn into its own unique web.

We know how their stories are going to turn out but we love watching new versions of their tales over and over and over again. So whatever your thoughts about rebooting the Spider-Man franchise after a mere five years in mothballs ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" winds up being a thrilling and occasionally even exhilarating spin on a familiar saga. The fine team of screenwriters -- James Vanderbilt (""Zodiac"") and ink-stained legends Steve Kloves and Alvin Sargent -- dont intuitively transpose the thrills of comic books onto the big screen with the same verve that Joss Whedon accomplished in ""The Avengers"" but they cram together an origin story a love story a tortured-adolescence story and a monster movie with a surprising amount of finesse. They also succeed in weaving together all the elements we know are coming (the spider bite the discovery of powers the death of Uncle Ben the creation of the costume and the crime-fighting persona) in new ways -- no easy feat for a character whose origins have been told and retold umpteen times in various media over the last half century. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" opens with two characters often ignored in the characters mythos Peter Parkers biological parents (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) who at the beginning of the film are on the run and forced to deposit their young son with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field). Also read Amazing Spider-Man Premiere On the Red Carpet With Andrew Garfield Emma Stone Teenage Peter (Andrew Garfield) is something of a nerdy outsider but not the milquetoast of earlier versions; this Peter rides a skateboard wears contacts and defends punier classmates from the bullying of BMOC Flash Thompson (Chris Zylka ""Kaboom""). Of course no teenager who looks like Andrew Garfield has ever been a nerdy outsider but then not too many teen girl science whizzes and debate team members favor mini-skirts and thigh-high boots like Emma Stones Gwen Stacy who becomes Peters girlfriend. Finding notes his parents left behind Peter tracks down his fathers old collaborator Dr. Curtis Connors (Rhys Ifans); the two had been studying animal-human genetics in the hopes that say a reptiles power to regrow its own tail could help Dr. Connors regenerate his missing arm. Peter gets the spider bite Connors takes an experimental serum that turns him into the maniacal Lizard and New York becomes their battleground despite the best efforts of Gwens police-captain father (Denis Leary). The film gets the expected story beats down pretty well but where ""Amazing"" vaults past the Sam Raimi trilogy is in its breathtaking visuals particularly in Spider-Mans swings across Manhattan. Anyone who thought director Marc Webb best known for ""(500) Days of Summer"" would focus too much on the teen romance and not enough on the action will be gobsmacked at the breathless charge of these sequences. (Unless youve got really strong objections to 3-D and/or IMAX pay the extra cost. Its worth it.) There were some moments I could live without (a scene where a bunch of generic thugs chase a newly-empowered Peter through an alley is so obviously choreographed it could be part of the troubled Spider-Man Broadway musical) while others took me totally by surprise. Our protagonists third-act heroics are matched by the brave and selfless efforts of regular people on the ground including cops construction workers and especially Gwen who calls on both her scientific know-how and her pluck to help save the day. Did we need another ""Spider-Man"" movie just now? Probably not -- but then we didnt necessarily need new versions of ""The Three Stooges"" or ""21 Jump Street"" and both of those wound up being exceedingly pleasurable. Its a bit naive to accuse a Hollywood studio of exploiting a familiar commodity for profit as though that werent business as usual. When said exploitation is handled so well (down to the best Stan Lee cameo to date in the Marvel movies) you might as well enjoy it. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"The Amazing Spider-Man (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Amazing Spider-Man (PG-13) Despite the odds this reboot of Marvel Comics most iconic superhero is fresh exhilarating fun. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/29/2012 Editor rating 3 Weve been here before with Peter Parker the bright but socially awkward teenager who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and develops extraordinary powers. The last time was 10 years ago when Tobey Maguire played Parker for director Sam Raimi. But filmmaking technology has made tremendous leaps over the ensuing decade while the genre of comic-book superhero movies has grown ridiculously cluttered. Part of the reason The Amazing Spider-Man feels so fresh and invigorating is that its story is so simple -- anyone remember exactly what the deal was with Loki and that cube? -- and its protagonist so relatable. Instead of a billionaire playboy or a Norse God who can beckon thunder you get a teenager trying to survive adolescence just like everyone else except his hormones arent entirely human and his puberty will be more torturous than most. As Parker Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) looks just young enough to pass for 17 and he sells the illusion with a terrific physical performance Hes all wild arm movements and impatient leg twitches constantly bouncing with a pent-up energy that will serve him well in short time. The screenplay by James Vanderbilt (Zodiac) Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People) and Steve Kloves (the Harry Potter series) refashions Peter from endearing square to a brainy self-aware outcast who has never gotten over being abandoned by his parents. He doesnt let anyone get emotionally close other than the uncle (Martin Sheen) and aunt (Sally Field) who have raised him. So when Peter falls for the beautiful Gwen Stacy (a hugely appealing Emma Stone) and she seems to reciprocate his interest you share his enthusiasm and excitement - the sugary thrill of that ever-important First Love. Shes the first person hes ever met who can dissipate his gloom. The Amazing Spider-Man was directed by Marc Webb whose previous film (500) Days of Summer turned out to be a perfect practice run for the Peter-Gwen romance. The movie involves you with this sweet likable couple and some of the films best beats belong to them (such as a scene in which Gwen must keep her father played by Denis Leary from realizing Peter has snuck into her bedroom). But then theres the matter of that spider and a well-intentioned scientist (Rhys Ifans) who is experimenting with reptile DNA in hopes of someday growing his missing arm back.The movie takes its time gradually hooking you on an emotional level. It draws you close Then mayhem. Webb shot The Amazing Spider-Man using 3D cameras and he has composed his images with the giant IMAX screen in mind. In the films big set pieces he often trains the camera on the spot where the characters will end up instead of chasing after them in a blur. The action is clear and easy to follow but also imaginatively staged like comic-book panels (the sequence in which Parker discovers his powers while riding a subway car is a marvel of choreography and editing). There are several point-of-view shots of Spider-Man swinging through the canyons of Manhattan where the 3D gives you a giddy elevating rush and even though theres only one villain -- a giant lizard-monster -- the pictures climax is infinitely more exciting than watching a bunch of superheroes battling hordes of faceless invaders from outer space. Despite its enormous size -- this is an expensive-looking movie -- The Amazing Spider-Man always remains intimate in scope with Peter and Gwen front and center. Thats the same thing Stan Lee and Steve Ditko did when they created the character on the page They kept the stakes personal so they actually matter. Yes youve seen this origin story told before but never like this and not with Gwen Stacy either. Comic-book readers who know what the future holds will be particularly appreciative of the way in which Webb primes the stage. If you dont know thats even better. The question thats been hanging over The Amazing Spider-Man since the cameras started rolling was whether it was too soon to reboot the franchise. Do we really need another one? As long as its this much fun -- yes yes we do. Cast Andrew Garfield Emma Stone Rhys Ifans Denis Leary Martin Sheen Sally Field. Director Marc Webb.

With pleasure. A friskier sweeter-natured variation on the story Sam Raimi told in his recent trilogy with greater emphasis on human relations than on special effects this Spidey reboot refreshes an old story through the on-trend notion of making a Marvel superhero less...super-heroic. With an effortlessly winning Andrew Garfield now in the title role and the irresistible Emma Stone by his side as Gwen Stacy the most delicious high school girlfriend a bug- and love-bitten young man could hope to woo The Amazing Spider-Man may be the first big-ticket big-budget big-action-sequence comic-book movie that also doubles as a lilting coming-of-age indie. I mean an indie at its very best with smart attention paid to coming-of-age issues including the prickly shyness of a social outsider whos an easy target for bullies the sexual and romantic awkwardness of a first-timer in love the run-amok emotions of adolescence and the unrest of a teenager who feels abandoned by his father. Of course attention is also paid to a supervillain the Lizard a giant destructive reptile played with impressive commitment to scaliness by Notting Hills Rhys Ifans. In keeping with the tonal makeover The Amazing Spider-Man is directed by Marc Webb a relatively under-the-radar thirtysomething helmer whose first and only other feature (500) Days of Summer told a quirky indie love story as pocket-sized as an iPod Nano. I can imagine the new guy getting the hang of his directorial superpowers in a hit-or-miss fashion similar to Peter Parkers own learning curve showcased in one of the movies most delightful scenes of self-mastery The kid seeks a quiet place to see what he can do with stringy spider goo. Webb keeps showy stuff to a minimum even during climactic moments. The modesty pays off. Through it all Garfield fills both his slackerish Peter Parker identity as well as his Spider-Man rubberwear with star-quality confidence. Mixing self-effacing sweetness with believable teen boy arrogance then adding a wee drop of snark the exciting British-American actor with the JFK Jr. dark good looks defies anyone to hate him because hes beautiful -- or because hes not Tobey Maguire. And any time the actor shares a scene with the radiant Ms. Stone...well the two are a chemistry experiment gone as blindingly right as reptilian Dr. Curt Connors little lab test goes terribly wrong. Whats most amazing in The Amazing Spider-Man turns out to be not the shared sensations of blockbuster wow the picture elicits but rather the shared satisfactions of intimate awww. A?

Photo Poor Spider-Man. His big-screen adventures that set box-office records in the early part of the century have been dwarfed by Batman and his fellow superheroes the Avengers. The notorious production travails of Broadways ""Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark made Peter Parkers alter ego an international laughingstock for months. And now comes ""The Amazing Spider-Man hardly awful but not coming close to living up to that adjective in the title either. Sometimes dull and mostly uninspired its much less a satisfying reboot like ""Batman Begins than a pointless rehash in the mode of ""Superman Returns. Its altogether possible that Andrew Garfield the young British actor who was so good as Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin in ""The Social Network could have made a fine Spidey/Peter Parker -- he certainly looks great in costume -- if he had been given a better script with something like the wit charm and energy of the first two ""Spider-Man films. Instead hes saddled with a slightly darker version of the original film from 10 years ago -- filled with unmotivated actions and wholly arbitrary plot twists. Add a slow-as-molasses first half choppy editing so-so effects and a chemistry-free love story and youve hardly got a recipe for fun. The sparingly deployed 3-D in this visually lackluster film adds nothing to justify the substantial loss of brightness or the stereoscopic surcharge (and that probably goes double for IMAX). One thing ""Spider-Man does have in spades is extreme predictability -- something that fans of superhero movies seem to crave if the massive grosses for the bloated and mediocre ""The Avengers are any indication. Credited to three writers (Alvin Sargent is the only holdover from the first Spidey team) the script tweaks Peter Parkers back story to kill off his mother and his scientist father in an automobile accident after they drop him off with Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field in a thankless paycheck gig). Teenage nerd Peter gets his fateful bite from a genetically altered spider not at Columbia University but at a top-secret research lab run by his fathers former partner Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) to which he and classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) have remarkably unfettered access at any hour of the day or night. Our hero develops the expected Spider-Man powers -- for climbing tangling bad guys in webs -- and like his predecessor played by Toby Maguire agonizes about what to do with them something that again has unfortunate consequences for Uncle Ben. Meanwhile Dr. Connors boss shows up out of nowhere and announces hes shutting down the lab Dr. Connors had hoped would provide the biomedical technology to allow him to grow a replacement for his missing arm. After Peter provides him with calculations worked out by his late father Dr. Connors decides to inject himself with a serum that quickly turns him into Lizard a giant reptile who starts throwing cars full of people off the Williamsburg Bridge. Well I guess getting stuck in traffic will do that to you. Fortunately Spidey is there to catch them in his webs though the sequence is so confusingly shot and edited that its hard to tell exactly whats going on. His rescue of a youngster from a burning car certainly could have been a lot more suspenseful. Unlike its predecessor that flirted with camp there isnt much in the way of humor in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" even when Denis Leary turns up as Gwens father (who conveniently turns out to be the police captain in charge of catching Spider-Man). But thats a small problem compared to the fact that giant lizards just dont make terribly interesting villains. You would think that Sony would have learned that lesson from its flop 1998 reboot of ""God-zilla which is unwisely referenced both in dialogue and visuals. Director Marc Webb -- a music-video vet whose only previous feature the indie ""(500) Days of Summer hardly prepared him for a film of this scale -- picks up the pace in the second half almost to the point of absurdity. Why bother having Lizard disperse biochemicals that turn New Yorkers into reptiles without showing the effects in more than a minimal fashion? Why would this preposterous villain prepare an antidote in industrial quantities except that it will come in handy later? In a clumsy attempt to evoke the citys support of Spider-Man as in the earlier films theres a big awkwardly staged sequence in which construction workers arrange cranes to allow Spidey to swing from them. Three scenes later we see this was totally unnecessary. None of that would matter quite so much in a more involving film -- one that had scenes as memorable as the one where Maguires Spidey hanging upside down has his mask pulled down by Mary Jane Watson (who does not appear in the new version) and they kiss in the rain. Though a few scenes were shot here its laughably obvious that most of the ""New York exteriors for ""The Amazing Spider-Man were filmed on a California backlot. The films geography is consistently amusing.

"Review Garfield a restless reckless Spider-Man Skip to main content Sections Home Washington National Culture International Entertainment Sports Health Business Weird News News Wire Commentary Video Blog Cartoons Social E-Brief Information About Us Subscribe Contact Us Donate Media Research Center CNSNews.com NewsBusters MRCTV MRC Latino MRC Business MRC Culture Toggle navigation sections cnsnews.comTM Review Garfield a restless reckless Spider-Man By CHRISTY LEMIRE | June 26 2012 | 357 PM EDT In this film image released by Sony Pictures Andrew Garfield portrays Peter Parker and Spider-Man in a scene from ""The Amazing Spider-Man set for release on July 3 2012. (AP Photo/Columbia - Sony Pictures Jaimie Trueblood) Its impossible to avoid the comparisons so we may as well just get them out of the way early so we can move on. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" -- a reboot? Prequel? New chapter? Its hard to decide what to call it -- is pretty much different in every way from the staggeringly successful Marvel Comics-inspired trilogy that preceded it. The basics are the same A high school kid gets bitten by a scientifically modified spider discovers he has newfound super powers decides to use them as a vigilante crime fighter and takes to the streets of New York in an unforgivingly tight red-and-blue suit. But in terms of tone characters performances and even visual effects ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" feels like its own separate entity. It may not be as transporting or genre-altering an experience as those earlier films especially the first two but it finds a distinct voice. And a great deal of that has to do with the central performance from Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker. In the hands of Tobey Maguire who originated the role in ""Spider-Man"" a decade ago Peter was nerdy scrawny insecure -- thats how his everyman relatability manifested itself. Garfield plays Peter as more of a misunderstood outsider a rebel with a chip on his shoulder a guy who wasnt afraid to stand up to the class bully even before he underwent his transformation. And that slightly arrogant attitude gives the whole movie a restless reckless energy and a welcome sense of danger. At the helm Marc Webb is a very different sort of director. He may not have sounded like the most obvious choice for a hugely anticipated blockbuster based on his only previous feature the romantic comedy charmer ""(500) Days of Summer."" His big set pieces may lack some of the imagination that director Sam Raimi brought previously but theyll do. More importantly though he conveys an emotional truth a pervasive sense of humanity which may be an even tougher feat in this kind of fantastical scenario. Webbs deft touch is especially clear in the scenes between Garfield and Emma Stone as Peters classmate Gwen Stacy who has to be the cutest best-dressed science geek on the planet. (In this version of the ""Spider-Man"" universe we must be pre-Mary Jane Watson.) Stone radiates the cute bright quick-witted presence weve come to know and love in films like ""Easy A"" and ""Crazy Stupid Love"" and she and Garfield have a sweetly flirty chemistry. (The scene where he finally asks her out without really asking her out is adorably awkward.) But theres depth and sensitivity there too since shes the only one who knows his secret for a long time. The script from James Vanderbilt Steve Kloves and veteran Alvin Sargent begins when Peter was a boy. A sudden threat forces his parents to leave him with his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) before disappearing forever. As Peter grows into a teenager be begins to ask questions about who they were -- especially his mysterious scientist father (Campbell Scott). (If you hadnt noticed its a great supporting cast. All these longtime actors show what total pros they are by finding just the right balance in tone and never over- or under-playing their parts.) This brings him to the gleaming high-rise where his fathers former partner Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) is deeply involved in some groundbreaking -- and unproven -- genetic research. When Connors finally tests his latest formula on himself the results dont exactly turn out the way he (or the unsuspecting residents of Manhattan) might have hoped. The destruction he causes in his altered state and Spider-Mans attempts to stop him from causing even more provide the basis for the films obligatory noisy showdowns. Which brings us to the use of 3-D ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" didnt need it. I realize I say that a lot but its an observation that seems especially true this time around. Webb barely applies this de rigueur trick -- maybe to make the background pop here and there or in an aerial shot of the city but he never puts the technology to its fullest use to make you feel immersed in this world. Basically the 3-D feels like an attempt by the studio to sling more summer moviegoing dollars into its web; you should resist especially since based on a quick tease during the closing credits a sequel is clearly being hatched. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a Columbia Pictures release is rated PG-13 for sequences of action and violence. Running time 138 minutes. Three stars out of four. ___ Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions G -- General audiences. All ages admitted. PG -- Parental guidance suggested.

A nerdy schoolboy from Queens gets bitten by an altered arachnid -- again -- in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a mostly slick entertaining and emotionally involving recombination of fresh and familiar elements. With the propitiously named Marc Webb at the helm and a solid screenplay Sonys reboot of its successful franchise arriving five years after the last Sam Raimi-directed installment is gratifyingly more of a drama-with-action than a nonstop assault on the senses. Benefiting enormously from the perfect chemistry of leads Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone this superhero date movie should do boffo biz though only strong word of mouth can confer must-see status. While this is essentially a remake of Raimis perfectly good ""Spider-Man"" (2002) the lure of (excellent) 3D and Imax showings should help rev up fanboys even if they feel its something theyve already seen; still such auds might be disappointed by how long it takes to get to the action. The screenplay surprisingly compact despite the 136-minute running time is co-written by James Vanderbilt (""Zodiac"") ""Harry Potter"" scribe Steve Kloves and Alvin Sargent who also worked on Raimis version. Following that earlier template the film roughly falls into two halves the stronger of which is the first set before the birth of Peter Parkers unitard-wearing alter ego. Some elements have disappeared (most notably the Daily Bugle newspaper with Peter now shooting photos for ... himself?) and some concessions have been made to fit the new villain Oscorp employee Dr. Curt Conners aka the Lizard (Rhys Ifans) into this origin story. Yet its still essentially a coming-of-ager/romance hybrid albeit one that feels even less comicbook-like than Raimis. Given that the film was shot in 3D it seems appropriate that the prop connecting teen Peter (Brit thesp Garfield) to his dead father scientist Richard (Campbell Scott) is a pair of glasses. The specs are not only a visual reminder of the films underlying father-son theme but also drive home the point that Peter a brilliant student whos occasionally awkward and overly gleeful is a nerd (whose interest in science turns out to be a huge plus). Indeed high school specifically the life lessons learned there figures heavily in the pic which returns to campus several times including for a key battle sequence. Webb and Garfield in a commanding performance that combines boyish charm and manly backbone establish early on that Peters growing pains and search for an identity are common to any teenager yet also inextricably linked to his lack of a father. Every issue may seem like a matter of life and death for an adolescent but Garfield makes Peter an interesting hero precisely because his struggles involve real people -- and real lives. After Peters bitten by the requisite spider at New York-based Oscorps genetic research facility where hes been shown around by cute intern and classmate Gwen Stacy (Stone) he discovers his new powers in a subway car and then the next morning in the bathroom. The two short scenes showcase Peters maladroitness as well as the pics underlying vein of character-driven humor. Though the film is clearly set in the present day or not-too-distant future (with Internet and holographic computer projections galore) there are some nice retro touches such as Peters old-fashioned camera and skateboard which comes in particularly handy when he tries to test the limits of his strengths in a scenic harbor-side hangar. After his uncle Ben (a benign Martin Sheen) is killed in a robbery Peter starts to think of ways he can harness his powers to find the killer with a well-placed luchadores poster inspiring Spideys mask. An hour has elapsed by the time the full transformation is complete but it hardly feels like wasted time since Webb as in his debut ""500 Days of Summer"" has drawn his characters and their predicaments in clear terms and with enough individuality to make auds feel invested. Though the action-heavy second half is well executed with long-held shots and clear editing allowing for a coherent almost old-fashioned sense of spatial relations and never-intrusive use of 3D its clear that Webb is more interested in the storys human dimensions. A spectacular setpiece involving Spider-Mans rescue of a small boy in a burning car hanging off the Williamsburg Bridge has much greater resonance than any confrontation with Connors generally destruction-oriented Lizard an ugly creature thats less human-gone-wrong than two-dimensional comicbook villain with CGI and prosthetic makeup to match. Similarly the palpable rapport of Garfield and the ever-affable Stone in the pics home stretch wows far more than the climactic webslinging antics. Technically ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" is assembled in expert if classical fashion. D.p. John Schwartzman achieves a glossy look on the Red camera while production and costume design set the film sufficiently apart from its predecessor without departing too much from the look of the comics. James Horners nonspecific score is unfortunately deployed so often and indiscriminately that a scene in which its not used as Lizard looks for Gwen Stacy at Oscorp suddenly crackles with a nervous energy absent from some of the bigger fight sequences. The pic is dedicated to producer Laura Ziskin who died last year. Obligatory end-credits kicker suggests which villain is waiting in the wings for the series part deux.

TWITTER Marc Webbs adaptation features Andrew Garfield as the webslinger hero and Emma Stone as his love interest. Leaping back onto the screen with a new cast crew costume and a whole new array of daddy issues The Amazing Spider-Man reboots the top-grossing Marvel franchise to altogether satisfying results. Directed with emotional depth and plenty of comedic touches by Marc Webb (no pun intended) this somewhat darker depiction of your friendly neighborhood superhero inserts a touching portrait of adolescent angst into an otherwise predictable dose of CGI-fueled action with stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone breathing new life into Stan Lees 50-year-old creation. With a stateside release set on the cusp of an extended Independence Day holiday weekend one hardly needs Spidey sense to predict huge worldwide returns for Sony in the first frame though long-term theatrical might be hindered by the arrival of Warners The Dark Knight Rises only two weeks later. PHOTOS The Amazing Spider-Man Andrew Garfield Emma Stone Appear in New Production Images Just a decade after Sam Raimis original Spider-Man propelled the wisecracking web-slinging teenager into the box-office stratosphere launching a (some would say endless) wave of comic book blockbusters where visual effects tend to stand in for veritable character development its encouraging to see Webb and screenwriters James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves build up a convincing Peter Parker origin story here combining tongue-in-cheek high jinks with a more downbeat tale of childhood trauma and attempting to answer those viewers wondering why they ever did a remake in the first place. Opening with a flashback revealing how the young Parker (Max Charles) was suddenly and mysteriously entrusted to his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field) by his father (Campbell Scott) -- a renowned scientist whose studies in all things arachnid give hints of whats to come -- the story quickly shifts to the present where 17-year-old Peter (Garfield) is introduced as a brooding skater with bad posture and an eye for science photography and his cute and clever classmate Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). After suffering a few obligatory high school humiliations and striking out at least once with Gwen Peter comes across his dads old research papers sending him on a stealth mission to the laboratory of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) who runs the state-of-the-art biochemical facility at the all-powerful Oscorp. While snooping around the labs massive web-churning cylinder experiment -- one of several impressive set pieces by production designer J. Michael Rival (Iron Man) -- Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and when hes assaulted on the train ride home his powers unexpectedly come out in full force. Not unlike Raimi Webb has much fun revealing Peters newfound capabilities early on highlighted by the subway scene and a hilarious basketball sequence where he schools the class bully (Chris Zylka) with his superhuman court skills. But such playful moments soon give way to some more despair when Uncle Ben is abruptly -- and perhaps all too conveniently for plot purposes -- murdered by a fleeing street thug sending Peter on a vigilante mission that eventually transforms him into the masked crusader Spider-Man. It came as somewhat of a surprise when commercials veteran Webb with only one indie feature under his belt was chosen to take the reins of the billion-dollar commodity but its clear in the films first half what the maker of (500) Days of Summer is bringing to the table here. Not unlike the forlorn greeting card writer of that catchy rom-com Peter is depicted as a smart but downtrodden outsider who truly comes to life when hes alongside his object of desire and the scenes between Garfield and Stone have a witty and realistic edge to them thats rare for a comic book romance. Such moments combined with Peters eternal quest for the father he never knew help carry the narrative through the mandatory denouement of fights chases mutant transformations and a rather lengthy final showdown set - surprise - at the top of a skyscraper as if Marvel simply swapped out the Stark Enterprises sign of The Avengers for the Oscorp one here. An earlier action scene on a traffic-jammed Williamsburg Bridge shows more inventiveness even if the visual effects (headed up by Jerome Chen Beowulf) are top-notch filled with POV shots of Spidey swinging down Fifth Avenue or in combat mode with his high-tech web shooters -- which along with the more latex-heavy costume reveal how our hero has been updated from previous installments. (The other update being that he relies a lot on his cell phone.) While the two leads deliver the goods and manage to combine a frisky sense of first love with the movies gloomier arc they are well-served by a terrific supporting cast with Sheen as Peters tough-loving guardian angel Denis Leary as Gwens overprotective policeman dad and Ifans as an increasingly mad scientist whose reptile leather fetish yields disastrous results. The swooping score by James Horner blends well with the crime-fighters many leaps and bounds while cinematographer John Schwartzman shooting in 5K with the Red Epic gets plenty of mileage out of the films various night sequences. Beyond a few brief flourishes the 3D hardly feels necessary here serving no other clear purpose than to sling a few additional dollars into Spideys web of worldwide ticket sales.

Five years since Sam Raimi hung up his I Love NY cap and Tobey Maguire ditched the Spandex its the turn of director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) and British actor Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) to turn back the Spidey-clock and start again. Memories are short in Hollywood and generations are measured in dog years.This version of the Marvel Comics staple is an origin tale (dead dad classroom bullying spider-bite) which is low on psychological trauma and high on regular teen woes. Again we learn how Peter Parker (Garfield) lost his parents and gained a mask. But the evolution into a swinging slinging city vigilante is framed squarely by recognisable adolescent awkwardness and romantic troubles involving his schoolmate and new girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) daughter of  the citys chief of police (Denis Leary). Garfield is more robust and charming than Maguire and he forms a pleasing Brit-acting axis with Rhys Ifans who plays his adversary Dr Curt Connors later The Lizard.Webb and the films writers have done a smart job of making a snappy blockbuster with few pretensions The Amazing Spider-Man is light on its feet and feels both intimate and expansive smoothly making the transition from hanging out in school corridors to hanging off the sides of buildings. Webb offers no radical rethink about how to craft a comic-book summer movie but he delivers a enjoyable rush over a patchwork of genres - romance action sci-fi horror and comedy (theres almost one for every leg of a spider) - while avoiding bumps at the joins. The action sequences are gripping and have a bouncy parkour-style giddiness to them. Garfield gets the best lines and is a comic often slapstick presence for much of the movie as he learns how to cope with his new powers. Theres a great scene on the subway as he bumps into fellow commuters (only a Brit could deliver the Im so sorry line). Webb gives the Spider-Man story a distinctly light touch even when Spider-Man and The Lizard are smashing their way through a school he allows us momentarily to view the scene from the perspective of an elderly librarian with headphones on. Were never far from romance or laughs and at times The Amazing Spider-Man feels like a romcom upgraded to include 3D and industrial-strength cobwebs. Spidey is the ultimate New York superhero and this is full of nods to the citys movie heritage. Theres a touch of Woody Allen to some of Garfields twitchy scenes while King Kong looms over Spideys skyscraper-top encounter with The Lizard. Theres even a scene where Parker mopes down the street with his shoulders hanging low like DeNiro in Taxi Driver. This lone gun with a red sock over his head also feels an urge to clean up the streets - but his New York is mostly benign a place where crane drivers and cops wave him on his way and the skyline sparkles in approval. Soft yes but also satisfying.

I felt that Andrew Garfields character delivered more gusto than Toby Maguires Peter Parker portaying much more inner anger. This version is also definately truer to the comic books than Raimis version and delivered a more gritty storyline.

To me this is THE Spider-man movie even though I do believe they could have done better with the Lizzard.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 20 2012CieloFeaturedI am too lazy to comment in every aspect.But I do believe that had this movie come before Raimis version people would be tearing Raimis version to shreds.This is far more true to the comics than Raimis for those of you that dont know.

Laden with way too many soppy scenes and then jumping oddly from slapstick to action it just doesnt work. The 3D is disappointing almost pointless and not used enough and Garfield just doesnt get the part well. Sadly one of the worst of the latest revamped Spiderman films.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 17 2012Nolans BitchFeaturedLot of people seem to be giving this 1 star because its not any better than the original but its still worthy of at least 3 stars right? If I had to Id give this a 3 1/2 stars or 4 if pushed Shame they took out the Lizard student face-licking scene that I saw last summer as an exclusive preview - It made him seem more evil. I thought Rhys Ifans did an admiral job for a villain that was written as being nicer than nasty - He would have done better if they turned his character into something more EVIL. Good job Webb Just not as satisfying as Raimis.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 17 2012scrumpyjackFeaturedOh yes the 3D impresses.........sorryFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 15 2012JohnFeaturedI thought nothing about this movie was better than the original version from ten years ago.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 12 2012predictableFeaturedOverall I did find this very predictable. In fact I think I might be getting sick of superhero films at last. Having said that Andrew Garfield is very appealing though both he and Emma Stone do seem too old for the roles theyre playing. Also the Lizard storyline wasnt too compelling and I actually thought the cgi wasnt great either. But I liked the spidey POV shots - that was new I thought - and also some of the dialogue was fun and a bit different I thought. But on the whole predictable and uninvolving.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 9 2012MattFeaturedWell I knew Id seen it all before but I couldnt see any reason for this ""reboot"" at all. Garfield and Stone were excellent but there was nothing new here the script was really clunky in places with lots of threads dropped the ""Lizard"" was a really poor bad guy Rhys Ifans performance definitely a low point. Id say if youve not seen the other films this one is a good one to start with. But if youve seen any of the others youve already seen this one.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 7 2012IanFeaturedIs it any good? It is worth going to see? The answer to both is a clear yes. As per a few of the other reviewers I feel to review gets it pretty much right. It is good and in places very good. It just doesnt quite turn very good often enough and there are no real excellent or superb moments. For me it is a 7 out of 10 film. A good 3 star just not quite very good often enough to be a true 4 star movie. Dont get me wrong it is good and you shouldnt miss it on the big screen but for me not quite a 4 star.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 4 2012MikeTFeaturedI saw the 2002 version of Spider Man and aEUR"" save for Kirsten Dunst aEUR"" thought it was pretty good. I couldnaEUR(tm)t think why another remake was necessary so soon and what twist could be added to the story. But I was wrong. From the opening titles this film is excellent aEUR"" a word I rarely use in my reviews. The CGI is exceptional. I donaEUR(tm)t always like 3d/CGI as the cinematography can sometimes be fuzzy but not with this film aEUR"" it was crisp from start to finish. The storyline is good aEUR"" and similar to other Spider Mans but itaEUR(tm)s really the CGI that now brings this story to life. The 3d was obvious throughout the film - something thats rare in films that are advertised as 3d. . The castingaEUR(tm)s also excellent aEUR"" Sally Field Martin Sheen Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield aEUR"" all great. I thought Stone and Garfield a believable match. Even Rhys Ifans was good. The storyline and script are great. The storylines humourous in many places. Possibly a few scenes are a little longer than they needed to be aEUR"" but thataEUR(tm)s the only fault I could find. IaEUR(tm)d like to think the Oscar/Academy panel would consider this film for cinematography and CGI quality next year. ItaEUR(tm)ll be interesting to see what Time Out regulars ScrumpyJack and ARCHGATE make of this one. Few films are good enough for 5 stars but this certainly warrants 4 stars from me.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 4 2012AlanFeaturedDave Calhouns review is spot on in all respects. This is a great film. Usually I get bored in superhero movies once the transfiguration from a normal human section of the story finishes. This was great throughout largely due to great dialogue and the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. The action sequences are really dynamic - I watched it in 2D as I dislike 3D but must grudgingly admit that it will probably be stunning in that format. By the way scrumpyjack after your light sabre comments re. Jaws (which did make me smile) some tit actually took a phone call during the closing scenes when we watched thisFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89725/the-amazing-spider-man.html,200,theamazingspider-man43,theamazingspider-man,timeout
