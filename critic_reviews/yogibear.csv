Neither smarter nor dumber than the average family-friendly comedy ""Yogi Bear"" is a bland and innocuous small-fry outing that retains a measure of the original Hanna-Barbera cartoons charm though scarcely enough to justify the time expense and visual-effects trickery it must have taken to inflate an endearing 2D cartoon into a dopey 3D extravaganza. Still as Foxs ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" pics made abundantly clear theres a sizable audience for incongruous pairings of live-action humans and patently computer-generated critters suggesting a steady stream of guests at Warners picnic table through the holidays and heavy minivan DVD-player rotation. As in the original cartoon series (spun off in 1961 from ""The Huckleberry Hound Show"") the friendly domesticated highly accident-prone Yogi Bear (voiced by Dan Aykroyd) is the premiere attraction of Jellystone Park where he tirelessly schemes to get his paws on visitors picnic baskets with the help of his pint-sized lily-livered sidekick Boo Boo (Justin Timberlake). Routine slapstick scenes involving projectile pies and other assorted Wile E. Coyote-style hijinks make clear that Yogi is a perpetual headache for hard-working Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) whos already got his hands full trying to save Jellystone from being shut down by an unscrupulous mayor (Andrew Daly). After Yogi makes a singularly unhelpful attempt to save the day its up to Ranger Smiths oddball love interest Rachel (Anna Faris) to find a way to protect Jellystone from encroaching bulldozers. High-flying shenanigans ensue and romance blossoms both in service of a duly nutritious but not excessively pushy eco-friendly message that might spike visits to state parks. Aykroyd and Timberlake do fine approximations of their characters distinctive cartoon voices and speech patterns; teens and adults in particular can keep themselves amused by imagining Timberlake in one of his more self-effacing career moves having to record lines like ""I have a problem with baked beans"" in Boo Boos trademark nasal delivery. By comparison the not-quite-photorealistic borderline-alien look of these CGI bears is off-putting the technological advancements of lifelike fur and detailed eye movements being no match for the clean expressive lines of hand-drawn animation. Directed with routine efficiency by vfx vet Eric Brevig (who made his feature directing debut with ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"") from a mechanically worked-out script credited to three writers ""Yogi Bear"" was shot using 3D cameras and looks better than most stereoscopically converted fare with Peter James lensing of the majestic outdoor scenery actually benefiting from the augmented visual treatment. Straight-laced Cavanagh and loopy Faris ground the pic as a pair of ideally matched nature geeks though arguably the best performance comes courtesy of New Zealands 36000-acre Woodhill State Forest ably standing in for the patch of classically American wilderness that Jellystone represents.

A mix of live action and animation it sees talking bear Yogi raiding pic-er-nic baskets at Jellystone Park with the help of Boo Boo. Thats until Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) is told to clean up his act or lose the park to developers. Yogi and Boo Boos slapstick attempts to save the park are mostly disastrous and occasionally amusing.Its a pedestrian story and several actors are miscast. Anna Faris gamely scrubs down as an eco warrior but her comic talents are wasted. Dan Aykroyd has fun voicing Yogi and Justin Timberlake is surprisingly authentic as Boo Boo but the 3D only serves to make the animation look more out of place next to the actors. Tots may giggle at the bears but this is no crossover film for parents - a fact highlighted by the witty Road Runner short before it. Maybe some animals should be seen and not heard.

Pictures Boo Boo (voiced by Justin Timberlake) and Yogi bear (voiced by Dan Aykroyd) in ""Yogi Bear"" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Yogi Bear Yogi Bear is barely smarter than the average kid flick BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Dec 17 2010 (...) Warner Bros. Pictures Boo Boo (voiced by Justin Timberlake) and Yogi bear (voiced by Dan Aykroyd) in ""Yogi Bear"" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Being smarter than the average bear is a dubious claim and in the case of the talking mascot of Jellystone Park it just means hes smart enough to steal picnic baskets from the human visitors.""Yogi Bear"" a ho-hum hybrid of live action and computer animation swipes a small ration of sweetness from the 1960s cartoon show but doesnt do much work of its own. In the original show porkpie-hatted Yogi had a certain rakish charm like Art Carney from ""The Honeymooners"" outwitting the wilderness. Here Dan Aykroyd mimics the original voice but the three-dimensional CGI isnt loose and lively enough to compensate for the unimaginative story. The premise is that an ambitious mayor (Andrew Daley) wants to close down Jellystone Park because of its budget deficit and then sell off the logging rights. When straight-arrow Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) is given a week to raise the money and save the park he plans a 100th anniversary picnic and fireworks show with the help of a visiting documentary filmmaker named Rachel (Anna Faris once again adding ditzy charm to a dull movie). But then inventive oaf Yogi and his bow-tied sidekick Boo Boo (nasal voice by Justin Timberlake) get into the act. Cue the booty-shaking rap song. Youve seen this movie before when it was called ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" but the filmmakers are hoping that your kids dont remember. Thats the only demographic that wont wonder why the parks two talking bears arent a moneymaking attraction in their own right.Compared with kiddie comedies like ""Daddy Day Camp"" and ""Furry Vengeance"" the wholesome ""Yogi Bear"" isnt a crime against nature.

Pictures live-action/computer-animated adventure in 3D ""Yogi Bear"" Photo Credit Warner Bros. advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Yogi Boo Boo and Ranger Smith team up to save Jellystone Park. Rated PG (mild rude behavior) BOTTOM LINE An uninspired attempt to turn a small-screen favorite into a big-screen blockbuster. CAST Dan Aykroyd Justin Timberlake Anna Faris WHEN/WHERE ""Yogi Bear"" showtimes and tickets LENGTH 120 Poorly made and unoriginal could describe both Hanna-Barberas animated character Yogi Bear who first appeared in 1958 and Warner Bros. 3-D movie ""Yogi Bear"" in theaters today. So why is one hugely entertaining while the other is well not? There was magic to the original Yogi despite the fact that his trademark tie and collar were just cost-saving devices (animators could move the talking head but leave the body still). Yogis va-va-voom speech pattern - ""Hey there Boo Boo"" - was essentially stolen from Art Carneys irrepressible Ed Norton in ""The Honeymooners."" He also surely took something from baseballs Yogi Berra. advertisement | advertise on newsday Why did this random mix of cultural influences embodied in a brown bear who steals food from campers in Jellystone Park became so popular? The makers of the new ""Yogi Bear"" have no idea. They spend more money computer-animating Yogi and his fretful sidekick Boo Boo but the bears still lack personality. Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake providing the respective voices lazily mimic the originals (the great Daws Butler and Don Messick). Making things worse are the live human characters of Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh bland) and a cute documentary filmmaker Rachel Johnson (Anna Faris wasted). Andrew Daly and Nate Corddry have fun as a corrupt mayor and his yes-man (they want to sell the park to loggers) but its a bad sign when you yearn for more of the villains. Overall the movie is the opposite of the cartoons Everyones body is in motion but nobody is using his head.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 17 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Dec. 16 2010 358PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Sixties cartoon icon Yogi Bear the bumbling ""pic-a-nic basket""-swiping denizen of Jellystone Park and his sidekick Boo Boo have been fluffed out through the magic of CG animation and shot (not literally - but more on that later) in 3-D for 80 minutes of palatable live-action/animated entertainment suitable for family consumption. While the outdoor sequences were filmed in New Zealands Woodhill State Forest - the movies most stunning 3-D moments - Yogi Bear does feature notable ""Canadian content"" via two Ottawa-born thespians. SNL alumnus Oscar-nominated actor bluesman vintner and member of the Order of Canada Dan Aykroyd gives a spirited reverent voice performance as the perpetually scheming Yogi. (Of course it is common knowledge that most males of a certain generation can muster a decent Art Carney-inspired ""Hey there Boo Boo."") And the affable Tom Cavanagh ( Breakfast with Scot TVs Ed) turns the perpetually enraged Ranger Smith into a kinder gentler live-action forest custodian who hopes reason will over time convince Yogi to forage for food using old-school methods. But is Yogi Bear smarter than your average seven-minute 1960s Hanna-Barbera cartoon? The series originally a spinoff from The Huckleberry Hound Show which introduced Yogi in 1958 typically featured the ursine operator in trademark hat and collar plotting picnic manoeuvres and other zany stunts with the diminutive more cautious bow-tie-wearing Boo Boo and inciting the ire of Ranger Smith. Directed by Eric Brevig an award-winning visual-effects veteran who made his directorial debut with Journey to the Centre of the Earth 3D (2008) Yogi Bear does not mess with a 50-year tradition. But it adds a few newfangled twists. There is Yogis latest invention the Basket-Nabber 2000 - ""were going to break the picnic barrier"" Yogi tells Boo Boo (check out Justin Timberlakes dead-on imitation of the original voice characterization). And then theres the bow-tie cam affixed to Boo Boo by Rachel (Anna Faris) an earthy filmmaker who arrives at the park hoping to make a documentary about its ""unusual species."" But the cash-strapped Jellystone is soon for the chopping block. Rachel and the smitten Ranger Smith learn that shifty Mayor Brown (Andrew Daly) is plotting to sell it to logging interests and thus solve the nearby citys budget deficit. The pair plan a fireworks show to mark the parks 100th birthday and attract hundreds of families - potential seasons-pass buyers. Ever the self-centred entertainer Yogi puts on a disastrous water-skiing demo that quashes that dream. The Ranger gets demoted and a chagrined Yogi goes ""back to nature."" Youd think the presence of two talking bears would at least designate Jellystone as a protected wildlife zone but I guess that didnt occur to the screenwriting team. These days it seems every family-oriented creature feature (the Brendan Fraser comedy Furry Vengeance et al.) sports an ""environmental"" theme to er engage young minds with todays pressing issues. But I suggest a different educational strand. First check out an episode or two of the beloved original series (available on DVD or easily found on YouTube) to compare 2-D and 3-D animation techniques. And then for grown-ups and older teens check out the hilariously dark ""alternate ending"" Yogi Bear parody posted on YouTube earlier this week by independent animator Edmund Earle. The three-minute CG-animated short which has received more than 1.5 million hits and lots of press was inspired by the 2007 western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford."" The short is not only a fine well-executed example of parody but its also the perfect tonic for parents who discover that taking the kids to a matinee of Yogi Bear in 3-D is no picnic.

Credit Warner Brothers Pictures Theres exactly one thing about the misbegotten big-screen ""Yogi Bear"" that might make you think back with any fondness to the Hanna-Barbera cartoons on which its based. That would be Justin Timberlakes charming performance as the voice of Boo-Boo Bear a fitting tribute to the original Boo Boo Don Messick (who also voiced Scooby-Doo and the Jetsons dog Astro).Otherwise this mostly live-action film is a bland 21st-century family comedy without a single moment that captures the wit energy or sophistication of the original which by now dates back more than 50 years. After some early picnic-basket stealing the story expands into a battle to save Jellystone Park from loggers and corrupt politicians with a romantic subplot involving Ranger Smith and a cute documentary maker.Weve seen this kind of talking-animal ecological parable quite a few times already and this one is so generic it wouldnt pass muster on Saturday-morning television.Dan Aykroyd gives a glum and largely personality-free reading of Yogi while the human actors who signed on to fill the space around the computer-animated bears -- including Tom Cavanagh as Ranger Smith Anna Faris as the environmentally minded filmmaker and Andrew Daly as the nasty mayor -- are pretty much helpless.Its especially painful to watch Ms. Faris so perversely funny in films like ""Smiley Face"" and ""The House Bunny"" reduced to big smiles and false heartiness. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The director Eric Brevig is a visual-effects specialist and he and his crew have done an excellent job of integrating their animated bears into some majestic scenery (filmed in New Zealand). ""Yogi Bear"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for jokes about marking territory and scratching backsides.YOGI BEAROpens on Friday nationwide.

(Warner Bros.) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday December 17 2010 400 AM Title Yogi Bear Partially animated comedy about Jellystone Parks star. With voices of Dan Aykroyd Justin Timberlake. Director Eric Brevig (120). PG Mild language. At area theaters. In 3-D where available.In movies as in life timing is often everything. Take for instance Eric Brevigs family adventure ""Yogi Bear."" Theres no reason to waste a nice summer day watching a middling movie about talking animals. But when cabin fever hits and its too cold to play outside? Parental standards may just be more flexible.It says a lot about the current state of kiddie comedies than ""Yogi"" actually feels like a mildly welcome discovery -- if only because it (mostly) resists the crude humor and lazy banality so often found in childrens films. In fact if desperation strikes during winter break adults might even be able to sit through it twice.That is no thanks it must be said to the big bear himself. An animated effect in a live-action environment this Yogi is a fairly charmless creature both as written and obnoxiously voiced by Dan Aykroyd. But Justin Timberlake is perfect as his sidekick Boo Boo and much of the live-action cast is equally enthusiastic.Tom Cavanagh plays Ranger Smith whose days managing Jellystone Park could be ending. Mayor Brown (standout Andrew Daly) and his chief of staff (Nathan Corddry) are about to sell the park to loggers unless Smith can find a way to stop them. He enlists the aid of a documentarian (Anna Faris) but ultimately it all comes down to Yogi Will the ever-mischievous bear be a help or a hindrance?Brevig is an Oscar-nominated effects supervisor and the experience shows in his unexpectedly clever use of 3-D technology. In happy contrast the story itself -- based on characters introduced in 1958 -- retains a sweet-natured gentleness. Granted theres a distinct overreliance on familiar catch phrases (its not funny the first time Aykroyd says ""pic-a-nic"" let alone the fifth). And none of the three screenwriters strained himself with effort. But the relative lack of coarseness and snark may come as a surprising relief even to 21st-century audiences.

Photo Tony Barson/FilmMagic After they see the 3-D film of ""Yogi Bear"" your cubs will never believe Yogi used to be cool -- the Kung Fu Panda of the 1960s. Itll be like trying to teach them ""Mabel"" was once a hot name or that there was once so little on TV that people had to sit around reading books. ""Yogi Bear"" is a partially animated version (the ""partially"" seems to derive from budget considerations as does everything else about the film) of the 1960s toon about a thieving but good-natured talking bear and his doubting young squire Boo Boo. (Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake do the voices in the style of the original.) The manic Yogi schemes to fill his belly by using crazy inventions to rob picnickers as the depressive Boo Boo expresses doubts (are they really two halves of the same conflicted being? This could have been ""Black Swan"" for preschoolers). Instead of being a true adversary the exasperated head ranger (Tom Cavanagh) of the park is instead a sort of weary baby sitter to the wayward bear. No one not even a documentary filmmaker (Anna Faris) or the dastardly mayor who proposes to sell Jellystone to loggers seems to find it remarkable that chatty bears roam the park lashing together booby-trapped picnic tables and manufacturing flying machines from spare parts. The animated bears arent even onscreen half the time (which is about 70 minutes before the credits roll) not that I much missed them. I was a little scared by their vacant serial-killer eyeballs the Charles Manson stares that suggest that after they devour everything in your pic-a-nic basket theyll probably offer a brief thank-you prayer to Satan. Cavanagh the always-engaging former star of ""Ed"" (with whom I am friendly) and the adorable Faris (whom I dont know -- but feel free to look me up Anna) make the non-animated scenes amusing as the ranger and the documentarian fall in love and fight to save the park. But the script doesnt give them a lot to do. Their main purpose is to react to Yogis clanky one-liners. ""Urinate on her to mark her as your territory"" he advises. Needing to raise 30000 the ranger plans a fireworks night (Yogi ruins it with a water-skiing stunt that sends rockets shooting toward the crowd) then tries to save an endangered turtle (which Yogi has been using as a footstool) that the pro-logging crowd wants to make disappear lest the park be designated a protected zone. Its already pretty well-insulated from creative ideas. ""Yogi Bear"" lacks even the zinging toddler anarchy of the ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies. Its more like the dim ""Underdog"" movie a couple of years ago. Huckleberry Hound dont sell yourself cheap.

Just sayin. Starring Anna Faris Justin Timberlake Dan Aykroyd T.J. Miller Nathan Corddry Tom Cavanagh Andrew Daly Dean Knowsley Director Eric Brevig Release Opened Dec 17 2010  Editorial Review Hey Boo Boo Zzzzzzzz . . .By Dan KoisFriday December 17 2010An uninspired studio product that demands as little from the audience as it did from its writers directors and actors the 3-D ""Yogi Bear"" mixes anodyne live-action nature with animated animal hijinks. The result? As is so often the case the satirical newspaper the Onions sight-unseen take is as incisive as any review could hope to be "" Yogi Bear Movie Introduces Boring Cartoon Character To New Generation"" a recent headline proclaimed. Of course Eric Brevigs film attempting to make Jellystone Parks resident pic-a-nic basket thief more fun ticks the boxes on some Warner Bros. memo titled ""Things Kids Today Like."" Fart jokes? Check. 3-D spit takes? Check. Yogi shaking his ursine rump to ""Baby Got Back""? Dear Lord check. An engaging storyline or jokes that go deeper than the hoary lines parents remember (or yknow dont) from the Hanna-Barbera cartoons of their childhood? Thats hard work buddy and canny filmmakers know essentially irrelevant to the box-office potential of a family movie dropped in the marketplace once frigid weather and school vacations set in. Yogi is a computer-animated brown bear who walks on his hind legs wears a tie and hat and speaks with the voice of Dan Aykroyd (channeling the late legendary voice actor Daws Butlers familiar tones). Yogis pint-size life partner Boo Boo is voiced by Justin Timberlake who displays neither his golden pipes nor any of the spark he brought to his role in ""The Social Network."" Mostly Timberlakes mushmouthed Boo Boo just plays the nervous scold to Yogis free spirit. The films plot has Yogi and Boo Boo helping Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) defend Jellystone from a rapacious mayor (the funny Andrew Daly) who wants to sell off the parks logging rights to bail out the city budget. The ranger doesnt want to hear about Yogis schemes of course. He just wants Yogi to act like a bear - rather than water-ski steal vending machines and build a contrabulous fabtraption of a flying machine for high-tech picnic-grabbing. (The Baskit Nabber 2000 as its called has no seat belts and its safety information card is just a hand-drawn picture of passengers screaming.) The one real bright spot in the films cast is Anna Faris who plays Rachel a documentarian who arrives at Jellystone to film its rare subspecies of walking talking bears. Faris long a critics-favorite comedian is best known for playing dumb (in ""The House Bunny"" and ""Observe and Report"") but in ""Yogi Bear"" she transforms her standard cluelessness into sweet science-nerd awkwardness. Of course Ranger Smith Rachel Yogi and Boo Boo team up to foil the mayors plans delivering a timely lesson on municipal budget short-sightedness - and a timeless one on staying true to yourself or whatever. While children younger than 8 should enjoy Yogis antics everyone older than 8 - pre-tweens tweens teens young adults parents grandparents great-grandparents and adult bears - will just be grateful that at 80 minutes ""Yogi Bear"" is shorter than the average barely-there family movie.Contains mild rude humor.

Pictures Yogi Bear movie review Swing left at Jellystone 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Yogi Bear Childrens. Starring the voices of Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake and Tom Cavanagh and Anna Faris. Directed by Eric Brevig. (PG. 79 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Remember Jellystone National Park? Well in ""Yogi Bear"" the live-action version of the old 1960s cartoon the parks name has been changed to Jellystone Park and that one missing word becomes the occasion for a story about uncaring politicians and ravenous developers out to wreck Yogi and Boo Boos habitat. They dont care about trees or animals just profit and power. This is a cute movie a kids movie and a rather good one. The computer-generated bears are adorable - its come to this Computer creations can be adorable - and the movie packs a lot of amusing incidents into a nice trim 79-minute package. But dont be surprised if in a few days right-wing bloggers start denouncing the movie as a feature-length propaganda piece to indoctrinate children with liberal values. Likewise dont be surprised if parents start bringing their kids to ""Yogi Bear"" for the precise purpose of introducing a dose of liberal social philosophy along with the Milk Duds and popcorn. On the one side the movie presents a smug repellent mayor (Andrew Daly) who wants to balance the budget by selling off Jellystone to loggers. And on the other we have a sweet documentary filmmaker (Anna Faris) and a dedicated park ranger (Tom Cavanagh) who want to save Jellystone for the animals for the trees and for future generations. But the movies lefty message goes beyond environmentalism into economics and the role of government in peoples lives. At the start of the film the ranger needs to come up with 30000 to close the parks deficit and prevent the sale. So he attempts to make the park profitable. But ultimately the movie suggests private-sector solutions are elusive and whats required is federal intervention. In the midst of this struggle - all played as though for laughs but still kiddies will get the message - we find the endearing Yogi (voiced by Dan Aykroyd) who is many times smarter than the average bear and who is pursuing his happy existence of stealing picnic baskets and showing off for his sidekick Boo Boo (voiced by Justin Timberlake). Yogi has no idea that right outside his private workaday paradise forces are converging to come in and level the place destroy his home and who knows maybe send him and Boo Boo to a zoo. Or separate zoos. These are not nice people. Yogi who was created as far back as 1958 (when the word Yogi meant only one thing to people a great Yankees catcher named Berra) is quite a positive character a can-do fellow who is always inventing things and coming up with elaborate schemes. Usually hes just smart enough to get himself into trouble but his resiliency makes him a not-bad role model. ""Yogi Bear"" takes place in a world in which everybody knows that Jellystone has a talking bear but no one seems to think thats interesting enough to pay the park a visit. So hes not much of an attraction but in our world ""Yogi Bear"" is attraction enough. For single adults theres no reason to see it unless youre a Yogi Bear completist. But adults with children who are used to getting bored out of their skulls with childrens fare may find in this a refreshing and politically charged change of pace.

"No pic-a-nic for returning 60s icon - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs No pic-a-nic for returning 60s iconYogi Bear a 1 starDecember 16 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic""Yogi Bear"" gives cheap hackwork a bad name. Which is a shame because hackwork made this industry.Fledgling director and special effects veteran Eric Brevig managed 92 diverting minutes of schlock with the 3-D ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" (2008) which offered some hope (against hope) for ""Yogi Bear."" You may know that ""Yogi Bear"" is derived from the animated Hanna-Barbera TV original. Yogi himself was introduced as a supporting character on ""The Huckleberry Hound Show"" in the late 1950s; the characters yen for the pic-a-nic baskets not to mention the vocal inflections amounted to an appealing knockoff of Art Carneys Ed Norton on ""The Honeymooners.""You may also know that just about anyone can ""do"" Yogis voice. The new movie didnt really need Dan Aykroyd to do it. Nor did it need Justin Timberlake to ""do"" Boo Boo Yogis fellow resident of Jellystone Park. What it needed was a joke or two and perhaps one less snot- or spit-related attempt at a joke.This is a live-action movie with a couple of animated bears (plus a cartoon turtle) forced to live within its drab confines. Tom Cavanagh underplays with an air of ""Oh well. Im making more than YOU make"" as Ranger Smith whose park is being turned into a logging-rights nightmare of devastation by the local mayor (Andrew Daly given far too much screen time; the movie isnt called ""Mayor Brown"" its called ""Yogi Bear""). I did enjoy some of the weirdo line readings brought to the role of the visiting documentary filmmaker played by Anna Faris. But the story about Yogis fall from grace and Ranger Smiths self-loathing issues (not since Dean Jones in the original ""Love Bug"" has there been more of a sad-sack kids-movie protagonist) and the fight to save the park from rank commercialism comes to criminally little. Besides is this really the picture to decry rank commercialism?Intriguing 3-D side note I cant recall seeing a recent 3-D movie wherein youre watching an action sequence in this case a whitewater rafting sequence and suddenly you think Wait isnt that 60s style rear-projection behind the actors heads? Why am I watching that in 3-D? Its like looking at a GAF Viewmaster. And if you remember those this movie isnt for you. Preteens may not hate ""Yogi Bear."" Its barely 70 minutes long without the end credits. But if Aykroyd contributed any of his own wisecracks to the voice work Id be surprised followed by stunned followed by bargaining acceptance and not laughing.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG (for some mild rude humor)Cast Dan Aykroyd (voice of Yogi); Justin Timberlake (voice of Boo Boo); Tom Cavanagh (Ranger Smith); Anna Faris (Rachel); T.

Miller Nate CorddryVoices Dan Aykroyd Justin TimberlakeDirector Eric BrevigDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG for some mild rude humorRunning time 1 hour 20 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Yogi Bear is a big boo-boo. Or at least he needs to go back into hibernation. In his Hanna-Barbera TV cartoon incarnation Yogi convinced us he was smarter than the average bear. But all these years later in his very own movie Yogis smarts get lost amid the dullness of the screenplay. On the plus side Dan Aykroyd nails the distinctive voice of the cartoon bear and Justin Timberlake is spot-on as his cautious sidekick Boo Boo. But the humans who act along with these computer-generated fellas dont fare as well. The eco-friendly story is familiar ultra-predictable and remarkably bland. Jaunty necktied Yogi and the more timid Boo Boo live in Jellystone Park which is presided over by Ranger Smith (a charm-free Tom Cavanagh). Mayor Brown (Andrew Daly) an evil self-serving politician -- is there any other kind in movies? -- wants to shut the park down and sell the land for logging. The park is losing businesses at least partially due to the pic-a-nic-basket-stealing shenanigans of Yogi and his pal. Surprisingly the news that the park will no longer be available to nature lovers hasnt gotten out so theres no community uproar. The only people who seem upset about the parks imminent closure are Ranger Smith and Rachel (a surprisingly ho-hum Anna Faris) a documentary filmmaker on hand to capture the scenic beauty. Forget that national parks are protected by the federal government. Logic is not a factor here. Ranger Smith and Rachel plan a big fundraising family event at the park but Yogi inadvertently ruins it. So he must redeem himself and help preserve his home. Think he manages it? Most sentient beings over 5 can probably figure out that Yogi saves the day with the assistance of the good ranger and the friendly filmmaker (who speaks ""Bear"" from her years documenting animals in the wild). A not-too-threatening monkey wrench is thrown into the mix when the rangers ambitious assistant (T. J. Miller) is wrangled into working against the parks good. The romance between Faris and Cavanagh lacks any spark but the 3-D fireworks (and some flying popcorn) justify putting on the glasses. Mostly however the visuals are lackluster. Along the way theres a potty full of annoying bathroom humor and a little dance-along to the overdone Baby Got Back to amuse the very young or very silly. A character as beloved as Yogi deserves better than this barely there story. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

One is the surrealistic 1999 classic ""Boo-Boo Runs Wild by ""Ren and Stimpy creator John Kricfalusi in which Yogis little bow-tie-wearing sidekick snaps under pressure and reverts to a feral state. The other is ""Boo-Boo Kills Yogi an extremely unauthorized CGI mash-up of the new Warner Brothers ""Yogi Bear and 2007s ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Both shorts can be found online and are highly recommended.If you want a ""Yogi Bear to make anyone over the age of 5 sit stone-faced and stricken you also have two choices The 1961 TV show or the inane new family film derived from it. What the original isnt a classic? Nope it was just popular without being any good. Worse its success allowed William Hanna and Joseph Barbera to flood the TV schedule with corny cheaply animated knockoffs for the next three decades. Be as nostalgic as you want but those cartoons were terrible.They were product in other words and so is the new movie -- designed to fill RedBox kiosks and 7-11 stacks and to keep children dully narcotized while their parents tend to more important matters. A mix of live-action and digital animation ""Yogi Bear is meant to hit the same commercial sweet spot as the recent ""Alvin and the Chipmunk movies. Sadly its not even that mediocre. To sucker you into the theater though the movies in 3-D and decent 3-D at that. But there the compliments stop.The live-action actors include Tom Cavanagh (TVs ""Ed) as Ranger Smith and the sweetly dim Anna Faris as Rachel a wildlife filmmaker who turns up at Jellystone hoping to make a documentary about the parks famous talking bears. Let us have a moment of silence while these two fire their agents.Dan Aykroyd voices Yogi and Justin Timberlake Boo-Boo the former doing his very best Art Carney impression the latter savoring the inspired silliness of his own casting. Picture Timberlake in the booth recording his lines and you have the best joke in the movie.Everything else is actively painful a frenetic unfunny mix of action romance dud dialogue and icky things popping out of the screen. Theres a plot -- a meanie politician (Andrew Daly) wants to close down Jellystone and bring in the loggers -- but no one appears to notice. The park scenes somehow make New Zealand look unspectacular. And theres Yogi himself a painstakingly photorealistic digital bear who walks on two hind legs and has creepy psycho eyes. (And what is it with the collar anyway?) Paging Werner Herzog -- the only way ""Yogi Bear would be bearable is if its furry hero went cold turkey on the pic-a-nic baskets and ate the producers.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There are two things viewers need to know about Yogi Bear Hes fixated on stealing ""pic-a-nic"" baskets from families visiting Jellystone Park and hes ""smarter than the average bear."" Adapted from the long-lived Hanna-Barbera cartoon--a testament to the vast reservoirs of blood a creative team can draw from a stone--the live-action Yogi Bear wastes no time demonstrating both of those precepts. In the opening scene Yogi (voiced by Dan Aykroyd in a credible imitation of a Honeymooners imitator) and his sidekick Boo-Boo (Justin Timberlake) survey just such a pic-a-nic basket from high on a cliff. Brimming with confidence Yogi delivers his catchphrase hoists himself onto a zipline and flies headlong into slapstick calamity. Classic Yogi. With 3-D-enhanced laughs to boot. Now what? Five minutes into their feature-length Yogi Bear movie the filmmakers have more or less run out of material save for switching up the means by which Yogi swipes baskets or leaving a few pies to cool on various ledges. So director Eric Brevig (Journey To The Center Of The Earth) and his screenwriting team turn to the oldest stock plot in the book one involving evil developers an operational-budget deficit and a wacky last-minute scheme to raise money and save the park. (See also Vengeance Furry.) This means those gentle adversaries Yogi Bear and Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) have to form an alliance (or at least declare a truce) beat back a land-grabbing politician (Andy Daly) and fill the next 75 minutes with whatever will make Yogi Bear a real movie. The best that could be said of Yogi Bear is that it doesnt diminish its source material There was never much to the character beyond the agreeable shtick and enough variations on the pic-a-nic basket gag to link segments with Snagglepuss or Huckleberry Hound. But meeting Hanna-Barberas standards is about as modest as achievements get.

(Our condolences Chipmunks.) Instead hes plopped unharmed into a sweetly frivolous storyline about a park ranger (Tom Cavanagh) trying to save Jellystone Park from the grips of an oily politician.

Yogi (who debuted in 1958 and was loosely based on The Honeymooners Ed Norton) is voiced by Dan Aykroyd unable to nail down the picnic stealers Catskills-comedian delivery. Justin Timberlake however flawlessly re-creates Boo Boos adenoidal intonation. The obligatory creature ass-shaking to a past dance hit (here ""Baby Got Back"") is blessedly brief though 21st-century Yogi proves to be an unbearable mugger. Still the kiddies will learn an important civics lesson by following the main plot thread Yogi tries to save Jellystone Park as Franklin Citys Tea Party-ish mayor prepping for a gubernatorial bid plans to sell it off to logging interests. (Another teachable moment for tykes Eating too many snacks in between meals will lead to Yogis unenviable BMI.) And though Yogis foil Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh formerly of TVs Ed) barely registers as 1-D among the non-CG performers adults will be thrilled to see Anna Faris as nature documentarian Rachel. Greeting Yogi by speaking in ""brown bear"" the actress never fails to be seriously goofy.

Neither smarter nor dumber than the average family-friendly comedy ""Yogi Bear"" is a bland and innocuous small-fry outing that retains a measure of the original Hanna-Barbera cartoons charm though scarcely enough to justify the time expense and visual-effects trickery it must have taken to inflate an endearing 2D cartoon into a dopey 3D extravaganza. Still as Foxs ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" pics made abundantly clear theres a sizable audience for incongruous pairings of live-action humans and patently computer-generated critters suggesting a steady stream of guests at Warners picnic table through the holidays and heavy minivan DVD-player rotation. As in the original cartoon series (spun off in 1961 from ""The Huckleberry Hound Show"") the friendly domesticated highly accident-prone Yogi Bear (voiced by Dan Aykroyd) is the premiere attraction of Jellystone Park where he tirelessly schemes to get his paws on visitors picnic baskets with the help of his pint-sized lily-livered sidekick Boo Boo (Justin Timberlake). Routine slapstick scenes involving projectile pies and other assorted Wile E. Coyote-style hijinks make clear that Yogi is a perpetual headache for hard-working Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) whos already got his hands full trying to save Jellystone from being shut down by an unscrupulous mayor (Andrew Daly). After Yogi makes a singularly unhelpful attempt to save the day its up to Ranger Smiths oddball love interest Rachel (Anna Faris) to find a way to protect Jellystone from encroaching bulldozers. High-flying shenanigans ensue and romance blossoms both in service of a duly nutritious but not excessively pushy eco-friendly message that might spike visits to state parks. Aykroyd and Timberlake do fine approximations of their characters distinctive cartoon voices and speech patterns; teens and adults in particular can keep themselves amused by imagining Timberlake in one of his more self-effacing career moves having to record lines like ""I have a problem with baked beans"" in Boo Boos trademark nasal delivery. By comparison the not-quite-photorealistic borderline-alien look of these CGI bears is off-putting the technological advancements of lifelike fur and detailed eye movements being no match for the clean expressive lines of hand-drawn animation. Directed with routine efficiency by vfx vet Eric Brevig (who made his feature directing debut with ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"") from a mechanically worked-out script credited to three writers ""Yogi Bear"" was shot using 3D cameras and looks better than most stereoscopically converted fare with Peter James lensing of the majestic outdoor scenery actually benefiting from the augmented visual treatment. Straight-laced Cavanagh and loopy Faris ground the pic as a pair of ideally matched nature geeks though arguably the best performance comes courtesy of New Zealands 36000-acre Woodhill State Forest ably standing in for the patch of classically American wilderness that Jellystone represents.

Daily Edition Login to download Film Review Yogi Bear May Send Viewers Into Hibernation 902 PM PST 12/12/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Warner Bros. A live-action/cartoon mix thats misguided in just about every way. TWITTER Poor Yogi Bear. At 52 he finally gets his first movie role and the film is likely to send viewers over the age of 10 into hibernation. Yogi is still smarter than the average bear but Yogi Bear is much less smart than most of the years kid-friendly cartoons. The only worse 2010 animated feature also came from Warner Bros. Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore which only confirms the great irony that Warners home to the greatest cartoon characters of all time has lost touch with its own heritage. The perennial trickster Yogi and his Jellystone Park pal Boo Boo Bear are among the more popular characters from the Hanna-Barbera stable although their antics have always appealed more to youngsters than adults. But as the considerable success of Toy Story 3 Megamind Despicable Me and Tangled more than demonstrates cartoons dont have to go all soft and gooey to win over a family audience. The film certainly had some of the ingredients right. Dan Aykroyd and Justin Timberlake nail the voices of Yogi and Boo Boo. Aykroyd perfectly captures the Art Carney-like vocal manner originated by Yogis first voice the late Daws Butler. And Timberlake loses himself in the more cautious yet easily swayed Boo Boo. The idea of combining live action and cartoon characters in 3D works just fine too. The 3D sends popping popcorn and errant fireworks into the audience and adds excitement to bruin adventures involving a flying machine and whitewater rafting all shot amid various natural wonders in verdant New Zealand. Unfortunately the story is so-o-o-o-o tired. Jeffrey Ventimilia and Joshua Sternins script rewritten by Brad Copeland runs in circles looking for jokes and slapstick while finding little. The best gags are traditional ones involving Yogis ingenious schemes to steal picnic -- a word in which he magnificently contrives to find three syllables -- baskets. The main problem evident both in the script and Eric Brevigs direction is that the humans are more cartoonish than Jellystones wildlife. The human story sets up two pairs of comic teams Yogis long-running nemesis Ranger Smith (Tom Cavanagh) and his overly ambitious deputy Ranger Jones (T.J. Miller) and a corrupt mayor (Andrew Daly) and his fawning deputy (Nate Corddry). Neither pairing registers on the comedy scale. The only semi-inspired byplay comes in the mayors ineptitude at operating his limos side window. Then theres a lame romance between Ranger Smith and a documentary filmmaker played by of all people the very talented Anna Faris. What on earth made her agree to this role? An illogical story has the spendthrift mayor conniving to sell Jellystone Park to pay off the citys staggering debts. Which doesnt explain how a huge national park can exist within a small town or how any mayor can sell a national park. Never mind. It may be a dumb way to put Yogi and Ranger Smiths way of life in jeopardy but if there were any spark to the jokes or character relationships few could care. Perhaps and its only a guess the film needed a veteran animator at the helm. Brevig a visual-effects guy who directed Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D came aboard when Warner Bros. decided to make the film in 3D but he has no real background in childrens entertainment. Children love a little naughtiness especially when a rascal like Yogi is the star. But Yogi Bear plays everything coy and cute when it needs rude and roguish. Opens Dec. 17 (Warner Bros.)
