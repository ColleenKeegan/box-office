Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review And Opening This Week Homeless for the holidays in Will Smiths feverish Pursuit of Happyness. Plus Dreamgirls and Mel. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Columbia Pictures) Depending on your taste the print ads for The Pursuit of Happyness which feature Will Smith and an adorable Afroed moppet (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) will give you either the warm-and-fuzzies or the heebie-jeebiesbut they wont give you a sense of what its like to feel your stomach dropping halfway to China. The movie is an economic cliff-hanger. It tells the (largely true) story of Chris Gardner (Smith) who in 1980 is barely getting by as a salesman for high-end bone-density scanners that he lugs from hospital to hospital in and around San Francisco. Folded up the scanner looks like an old portable turntableor according to a passing acid casualty a time machine. Chris knows these scanners are too expensive but he paid for them out of pocket and isnt selling them quickly enough. His wife Linda (Thandie Newton) dissolves under the strain and decampsat which point Chris who has no college degree decides against ridiculous odds to try to talk his way into a six-month nonpaying internship with Dean Witter Reynolds. The director Gabriele Muccino and the screenwriter Steven Conrad dont underline the central ironythe hysterically narrow margin in the film between prosperity and homelessness. But that irony is in every jittery frame the American Dream astride the American tragedy. Americanisms abound in The Pursuit of Happyness starting with the title which appears on a collage outside Chriss five-year-olds day-care center. The misspelling prompts Chriss ruminations (in voice-over) on the meaning of happiness (a fertile subject) and more important on pursuit. Hes always making mad dashesafter doctors stockbrokers investors. The filmmakers dont seem to worry about whether Chris believes in what hes sellingtheyre neutral on the subject of whether that scanner is a smart buy or Dean Witter really know whats best for peoples money. Pursuit in this context is a Jeffersonian way of saying hustle. At one point my notes on The Pursuit of Happyness read (I swear) Grim. Grim. Wow thats grim. Going down. Down down down. Weve hit bottom now. Oh God were still sinking. It cant get any worse. Oh no  Conrads last film the underrated The Weather Man was a parade of miseries too but the protagonist (Nicolas Cage) didnt move very fast in the throes of his existential crisis and the palette (it was Chicago in winter) was glacial. Here those crazy San Francisco hills give the movie a lift and Muccino frames it all airily with a glancing touch. The only tinny note is the departure of the wife who seems less concerned about the welfare of her child than I (and I hope you) would be. Will Smith is superb. He often plays hustlers but never a hustler with a wolf at the door hustling for his life. Or more accurate for his sons life. The boy is in fact Will and Jada Pinkett Smiths son and has a lovely watchful presence. Did that presence give Smiths acting extra urgency? Theres so much excitement around the opening of Dreamgirlsits a musical its an African-American musical its a musical inspired by Motown and by one of the most momentous cultural upheavals in our countrys history it stars Beyonce and Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy in a (serious) comeback rolethat I know Im going to bring down the room by saying I think its just okay. Well Jennifer Hudson is more than okay. She got booted off American Idol too early so when her character Effie White gets booted out of the SupremesI mean the Dreamettesbecause shes too fat and ornery and has too big a voice and the ruthless manager Curtis Taylor (Foxx as Berry Gordy) wants a lighter sound and a beautiful-skinny lead singer Deena Jones (Beyonce as Diana) her disappointment carries something extra. When she lets loose with her abandoned lover number And I Am Telling You Im Not Going theres twice the elation in hearing her smoke those high notes with something halfway between a bawl and a shriek but always dead on key. Shes proving shes too good for Curtis and much too good for Simon Cowell. And unlike those American Idol winners Hudson can keep all her money. Dreamgirls touches on (or whacks) a number of themes among them the mistreatment of black musicians by whites who appropriated (i.e. gave away to white singers) their songs while confining blacks to the chitlin circuit. But its really a morality play about the exile of Effie (the true artist) and the corruption of Curtis who builds his super girl group around the synthetic Deena (who becomes his trophy wife) and drives away his artistic family. As someone who considers the Phil Spector Motown era one of the high-water marks in the history of music I feel bound to say I dont think this is the whole storybut then Dreamgirls doesnt have actual Supremes songs. The music it has is awful. The onstage numbers get stale after two choruses and the old-fashioned Broadway ones in which people sing their thoughts are Lite FM sludge like Lionel Richie doing recitative at the Met. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Your village pillaged and whats left of your family left down a hole youre herded through the jungle in abject agonising bondage to arrive barely standing or sane in a city of death where children play in shit. Before you can say Jack Robinson youre splayed on a bloody rock atop a ziggurat limbs pulled taut by men with big knives as the crowd raves below. And without giving away too much about the rest of Jaguar Paws day lets just say that isnt the worst of it. Whod be a Late Postclassic Mayan eh?The last film Mel Gibson directed was set in an alienatingly ancient society performed in a fossilised language and sodden with sacrificial blood and he seems to reckon the formula aint broke. Like The Passion of the Christ and its predecessor Braveheart Apocalypto is a period piece on a self-consciously epic scale in which the social wrenches of historical transition - essentially the suppression of an idyllic (rural) community by an all-powerful but decadent (city) empire - are translated into physical trauma visited with near-rapturous detail on the body. Apocalypto may or may not be a credible vision of Mesoamerican life 500 years ago - and plenty of academics and indigenous Americans say not - but its undoubtedly another Mel Gibson film about people being tortured to death.The films opening shots - forest floor foliage the noise of birds and insects - call to mind The New World Terrence Malicks sublime calm tragedy about similar subject matter. Then a tapir bursts through the brush is speared by spring-mounted spikes and has its organs dished out one by one. Gibsons is the world of the hunt and the kill and he is exceptionally proficient at their depiction. Using Panavisions new digital Genesis system photographer Dean Semler brings tremendous momentum and adrenaline to the jungle chases that make up a large part of the action and on its own terms the films Maya City is an extraordinary feat of imaginative will giving a convincing impression of lived-in and troubled complexity.This is by no means a boring film then but it is a grotesque one and that brings it pretty close to camp. A spirit of sadism informs the endemic violence theres no shortage of characters who delight in pain (including fat children and deformed dwarves of a type familiar from The Passion...) but even healthcare consists of lacerations and biting ants. And yes nature is cruel but do we really need to see a jaguar eating a mans face off? Gibson claims contemporary parallels for his story - from deforestation to the sacrifice of the weak by the powerful - but a pay-off that teeters between reactionary and downright absurd leaves this ultimately feeling like a succession of gorified Boys Own scrapes.

"Apocalypto | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; apocalypto ) Apocalypto (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli With Apocalypto Mel Gibson has proven its possible to create a compelling action/adventure film in almost any setting. Gibsons theme (which is only partially developed) as revealed in an opening caption is that all great civilizations fail when they begin to rot from the inside. Over the next 2 1/4 hours he provides glimpses into the degeneracy of the Mayan society on the eve of its encounter with the Spanish conquistadores. However Apocalypto is not a political tract or a dissertation about why the Mayan age came to an end. Instead its a high-octane adventure that concludes with one of the most intense extended chase sequences in recent movie history. Apocalypto is not assigned a date but since it concludes with an image of the arriving Spanish one can assume the year is 1519. Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is a young warrior living in a peaceful village where hunting and making babies appear to be the primary occupations. Jaguar Paw has gotten off to a good start his wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) has given birth once and is pregnant with a second child. Still Jaguar Paw has a distance to go to match the size of his fathers family. Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead) has ten children. The villages peace is shattered when a war party arrives from the center of Mayan civilization. The armed men torture kill rape and maim. Jaguar Paw is able to lower his wife and son into a hole in the ground before he is captured and exposed to a forced march through the jungle. At the end of the journey lies the great temple and the prospect of being sacrificed to appease the Sun God. Like two of Gibsons previous movies Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ Apocalypto doesnt avoid depictions of brutal graphic violence. It is worth noting that some of the most heinous crimes such as the rapes occur off screen. Gibson makes it clear whats transpiring but he doesnt feel the need to subject the audience to that. Theres still plenty of blood and gore including at least one instance in which the slitting of a throat is shown in unbroken detail. This is not a movie for the faint of heart. There are more similarities to Braveheart than The Passion of the Christ. (While in the comparison game it would be unfair to ignore the Aussie post-apocalyptic chase movie Mad Max in which Gibson starred before his Hollywood career ignited.) Although the plot of Apocalypto is considerably different than that of Gibsons Oscar-winning picture the spirit is much the same. This movie is about heroism and overcoming odds. Aside from the aforementioned violence the only thing Apocalypto has in common with The Passion of the Christ is that both are subtitled. Because of this a cynic could argue that Gibson has made the most expensive art-house action movie of all time. Will enough people put aside their aversion of subtitles in order to make this profitable? Apocalypto is divided into three sections as is true of many movies (both traditional and non-traditional). The film begins slowly allowing us to get to know a small group of characters. We are given a glimpse into village life before everything comes apart in one of the most uncompromisingly vicious sequences in any movie released this year. The second part of the film encompasses the forced march to the city ending with the selling of women into slavery and the preparation of men for sacrifice. The final act is a long chase. Lasting nearly 45 minutes it maintains a high level of tension and includes many of the expected obstacles from this sort of jungle adventure waterfalls quicksand and hostile animal life. Some viewers may feel exhausted when the movie is over. Apocalyptos final third is an unrelieved adrenaline rush. Action fans will love it. If all the movie represents is a lot of pretty scenery and well executed action sequences there would be nothing distinguishing about Apocalypto. However - and heres where the Braveheart parallel is the strongest - Gibson succeeds in forging a strong bond between the audience and the protagonist. This is done quickly and economically. We are shown the love Jaguar Paw has for his wife and son and the lengths to which he will go to keep them safe. He is also depicted as resourceful and durable. On more than one occasion I found myself thinking of him as the MacGyver of the jungle. To provide an effective balance we are then introduced to a villain Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo) who is as intelligent and dangerous as he is detestable. To up the ante theres a second bad guy Snake Ink (Rodolfo Palacios) who we probably want to see die even more than his boss Zero Wolf. Snake Ink delights in torturing our hero when Zero Wolf isnt looking. Apocalypto represents a forceful two-plus hours and it isnt for everyone. I appreciate that Gibson set this in a time and place we dont often see on screen. The cameras operated by Dean Semler make this long-dead world come alive. The setting makes the movie seem more exotic and less derivative although those aspects dont lessen the excitement. Historians may quibble about the movies accuracy but Gibson isnt trying to make a documentary. The best thing I can say about Apocalypto is that despite belonging to an overpopulated genre its unlike any other movie to reach theaters this year and because it is as visual an experience as it is visceral it is best seen on a large screen.

After the first few impalements amputations rapes eviscerations and beheadings I thought Mel Gibsons Yucatec-language action adventure set in the waning days of the Maya civilization might well be the most obsessively graphically violent film I had ever seen. By the end I felt sure it was the most obsessively graphically violent film Id ever seen but equally sure that ""Apocalypto"" is a visionary work with its own wild integrity. And absolutely positively convinced that seeing it once is enough for one lifetime. ENLARGE However Mr. Gibson may present himself in public these days hes a singular presence in contemporary American films; no one else is making movies like ""Apocalypto"" or ""The Passion of the Christ"" let alone paying for them out of personal bank accounts. Yet hes also rooted in the Hollywood tradition of flamboyant obsessive-compulsives -- Griffith Von Stroheim De Mille -- who combined the power of primitivist themes with all the razzle-dazzle technique at their command. The technique deployed in ""Apocalypto"" is elegant though that shouldnt be surprising given the superb craftsmanship of ""The Passion of the Christ."" Dean Semlers cinematography Tom Sanderss production design Roberto Bonellis art direction John Wrights editing James Horners music and Mayes C. Rubeos costumes all illuminate the story of one man and his family trying to survive in the ghastly chaos of a pre-Columbian society thats grown rotten to the core. (If the screenplay by Mr. Gibson and Farhad Safinia suggests that any other civilizations are rotting its as the writers intended.) In the department of razzling and dazzling ""Apocalypto"" embraces an assortment of consecrated action tropes and reliable cliches dating back to the silent cinema -- brilliant chases spectacular leaps and falls a creepy seeress women and children in constant jeopardy waters rising quicksand gurgling lives saved by a solar eclipse cliff-hangers on the edge of sandy cliffs. Due to the absence of ice floes off the Yucatan theres no Mayan equivalent of Lillian Gish. The hero Jaguar Paw is played by Rudy Youngblood a Native American artist and musician making his acting debut. In a production that boasts a cast ""made up entirely of indigenous peoples from the Americas"" Mr. Youngblood builds on his indigenousness with a bag of shrewd actors tricks that date back to early Marlon Brando. The impressive result is a protagonist who keeps our disbelief more or less suspended and that is no easy feat. At the outset Jaguar Paw his pregnant wife and their young son are among the peaceful jovial and poetic residents of a village whose worst plague is a mother-in-law reminiscent of the one played last year by Jane Fonda. When the village is invaded by stone-age body-builders with bad teeth but great costumes Jaguar Paw is taken prisoner made a slave (all the slaves are slathered in ""Braveheart"" blue) and forced to endure several successive hells while making good on a promise to his wife that he will return. The film takes that promise solemnly. Its a moral fable about the primacy of the family and other things as well strong fathers; overcoming fear; standing up to corrupt authority (Mad Max careering even farther off-road); the need for new beginnings the sanctity of the land and again not surprisingly given the radical fundamentalism of Mel Gibsons religious beliefs a tacit rejection of the Christianity that arrives by Spanish galleon on the Yucatan shore. As one whose Yucatec-language skills are wanting I cant pass judgment on the quality of the dialogue or on the accuracy of the subtitles which include the memorable phrase ""We must not let this man make feet from us."" I will tell you though that by the time Jaguar Paws journey was over I could not wait to make feet from the theater. Days of Glory ENLARGE From left to right Jamel Debbouze Sami Bouajila and Roschdy Zem portray soldiers in Days of Glory. ""Days of Glory"" is the forgettable English title of ""Indigenes"" an unforgettable drama about Algerian soldiers fighting in the French army in World War II. (Its Algerias Oscar entry for best foreign film and would have my vote if I were an Academy member.) The French title translates to ""natives"" but with a strongly ironic connotation. The soldiers in question dust-poor volunteers who had never set foot on French soil fought valiantly to liberate the motherland from Nazi rule. Yet their fellow French soldiers called them ""natives"" or worse used them as cannon fodder and saw them as subhuman scum. Before and after anything else ""Days of Glory"" which was directed by Rachid Bouchareb from a script by Olivier Lorelle is a splendid war movie. The combat sequences are harrowing -- all the more so for the directors spare sharp-eyed style -- and the performances are phenomenally fine Jamel Debbouzes nebbishy Said an unswervingly loyal private with a missing hand and buried passions; Roschdy Zems Messaoud hopelessly in love with a sweet-spirited French woman; Bernard Blancans Sgt. Martinez caught between his North African troops and his French superiors and Sami Bouajilas Abdelkader a proto-intellectual with a burning sense of justice. More than that though -- as if a film needed to be more than that -- ""Days of Glory"" is a history lesson that has already moved one French mountain. When it opened in Paris in September audiences learned from the movies end titles and Web site that army pensions being paid to North African veterans or their widows were only a fraction of those still going to their counterparts in metropolitan France. After a screening at the Elysee Palace the French president Jacques Chirac was so moved by the film that he ordered the pensions to be equalized as ""an act of justice."" For audiences anywhere the film helps to clarify the colonial roots of the growing conflict between Europe and its Muslim populations. It does so with remarkably little didacticism steadfast humanity and a minimum of sentimentality which is confined to an ending reminiscent of ""Saving Private Ryan."" Until then its easy to imagine one of the survivors the eloquent young firebrand Abdelkader living a thwarted life of self-despair in postwar France (like the grizzled old Algerian in ""Cache"") or just as plausibly becoming a radicalized anti-French fighter like the Muslim ideologues in ""The Battle of Algiers."" The ending might have been more provocative if it had been less specific though the specificity has a dramatic purpose. Still Abdelkaders fate like the film as a whole rings resoundingly true. He does what he does because of who he has always been. Blood Diamond What a great year this is turning out to be for Leonardo DiCaprio. A few months ago he was nothing less than sensational as a desperate undercover cop in Martin Scorseses ""The Departed."" Now hes the beating heart and soul of ""Blood Diamond"" Edward Zwicks ambitious but ultimately unmanageable amalgam of action romance civil war and social chaos in the Sierra Leone of the 1990s. Mr. DiCaprio plays Danny Archer a former mercenary from Zimbabwe whos become a diamond smuggler. Djimon Hounsou is Solomon Vandy a fisherman who finds a diamond much bigger than the Ritz. From that confluence of character and circumstance one might expect a thriller with existential overtones a sort of ""Treasure of Sierra Leone."" Or failing that a romantic adventure capitalizing on the presence of Jennifer Connollys journalist Maddy Bowen in the tradition of ""The Year of Living Dangerously."" Yet nothing so simple seems to have crossed the minds of Mr. Zwick or his screenwriter Charles Leavitt. They have laid on enough plot elements to fill a periodic table the mistrust and mutual need binding Danny and Solomon; Maddys investigation of the diamond trade; the mistrust and mutual need plus plenty of sexiness binding Danny and Maddy; the horrifying (and vividly dramatic) depredations of child soldiers and Solomons need to find one of those lethal children who happens to be his lost son. Any one of these elements would have made a fascinating movie -- especially the shocking assertions about the human toll of the diamond trade. Thanks to the redundancy though ""Blood Diamond"" is dramatically diffuse and at least 30 minutes too long. Thanks to Mr. DiCaprios raffishly dashing soldier of fortune the movie is worth watching all the same. The Holiday One bad sign of many in Nancy Meyerss ""The Holiday"" is how much the movies home-swapping women played by Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz talk to themselves. Its not that theyre crazy though both are improbably crazed by unrequited love (which Lorenz Hart warned in a trenchant lyric is a bore). Its that theyre stuck with the movies structure which uses a home-exchange Web site to send Ms. Diazs unhappy Amanda from California where she produces movie trailers to an empty cottage in the Cotswolds and Ms. Winslets unhappy Iris from England where she writes for a newspaper to an empty mansion in Los Angeles. Eventually both women find conversational partners followed by happiness but here again the story goes on at untoward length. In what was clearly designed to be a chick flick the on-screen chicks work hard at being endearing while Jude Law as Amandas more than conversational partner charms everyone effortlessly and gets the best lines.    DVD TIP Mel Gibson gave a startling performance as Jerry Fletcher a seemingly paranoid New York cabbie in an exciting thriller called ""Conspiracy Theory"" (1997). Yet the movie written by Brian Helgeland and directed by Richard Donner (who directed all three of Mr. Gibsons ""Lethal Weapon"" films) was a flop. Audiences still doted on Mel Gibson then and they didnt want to see him act crazy.

Related New Gibson film stirs objections Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Apocalypto"" with Rudy Youngblood Raoul Trujillo Rodolfo Palacios Dalia Hernandez. Directed by Mel Gibson from a screenplay by Gibson and Farhad Safinia. 137 minutes. Rated R for scenes of graphic violence and disturbing images. In Yucatec Maya dialogue with English subtitles. Several theaters. Mel Gibson recently stated that the stressful production of ""Apocalypto"" may have contributed to his recent DUI arrest and anti-Semitic tirade. Whatever the reasons for Gibsons infamous rant ""Apocalypto"" surely posed a major challenge and Gibson has delivered an impeccably crafted action-adventure that starts fast and never lets up. Bolstered by the triumph of ""The Passion of the Christ"" Gibson can afford the risky prospects of a brutally violent film about the demise of ancient Mayan culture circa 1517 A.D. But where an eccentric genius like Werner Herzog might have opted for a more mystical approach to this rarely filmed Meso- american subject matter Gibson (with co-writer Farhad Safinia) has leveraged his commercial instincts with a pulse-pounding tale that anyone can relate to. The visceral manhunt of ""Apocalypto"" could be easily adapted to any contemporary action genre and Gibsons purely visual emphasis adds another layer of universal appeal. Granted ""Apocalypto"" isnt for everyone. The unflinching brutality of ""The Passion"" is intensified here with vivid images of jungle savagery ritual decapitations and torn-out hearts and a perspective on death as primal as it is poetic. Theres more than a little ""Braveheart"" in Gibsons embrace of gory survival instinct. For all its bloodiness however ""Apocalypto"" (roughly meaning ""A New Beginning"") is an arrestingly beautiful film with a minimum of computer-assisted artifice. It begins by playfully establishing the hunting routine of Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) and his fellow villagers. But their intimate peace is soon shattered by a band of fearsome marauders headed by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo) and his sadistic scout Snake Ink (Rodolfo Palacios) who lead their captives to slavery and death in a corrupted Mayan city. With his pregnant wife (Dalia Hernandez) and young son in hiding Jaguar Paw escapes into the jungle and ""Apocalypto"" turns into a relentless chase movie as he survives spearings a treacherous waterfall and a hungry jaguar with Zero Wolf and his warriors in constant pursuit. Given his established penchant for violence one wishes Gibson had devoted more time to a deeper appreciation of Mayan culture. But the films authentic detail speaks for itself and breathless pacing compensates for Gibsons relative gloss on anthropology. Filmed in Mexico with Panavisions state-of-the-art Genesis digital cameras ""Apocalypto"" (like ""Superman Returns"") expedites the end of analog film as we know it. Dean Semlers cinematography is nothing less than stunning James Horners exotically nuanced score is one of his finest and the performances by an all-indigenous cast are uniformly engaging. But the greatest cause for celebration is Gibsons ongoing defiance of Hollywood expectation. A lesser director would remain comfortable within established boundaries but for all its familiar elements of story action and character ""Apocalypto"" is anything but safe. Gibson may be a flawed human being (who isnt?) but his passionate talent is undeniable.

Starring Rudy Youngblood Morris Birdyellowhead and Dalia Hernandez. Directed by Mel Gibson. (R. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. In Mayan with English subtitles. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) By now its fair to say that Mel Gibson does not make boring movies. He does however make movies that make you a little worried about him and ""Apocalypto"" might be the ultimate exemplar of the Gibson style. Its a bloodbath of course but to say that isnt enough. Scorsese movies can be a bloodbath but would Scorsese ever show you a man eating the raw testicles of a wild boar within the first five minutes of screen time? And what about the running motif of beating hearts yanked from living bodies? No for those excesses one can only turn to Mel. In any discussion of ""Apocalypto"" which deals with the twilight of Mayan civilization a delicate distinction must be made. It would be inappropriate and probably inaccurate for any critic to pronounce on the mental health of a filmmaker based on his movie. Yet no description of ""Apocalypto"" can even begin much less be complete without noting -- say in a colloquial nonclinical anecdotal sort of way -- that it seems like something made by a crazy person. Its unrelenting a succession of blood-soaked disaster an artfully designed parade of cruelty that would make the Marquis de Sade get up and say ""Enough already."" The mission seems to have been to show cruelty and then a justification was found for it. And so at the beginning we get a quote from Will Durant ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."" Aha So thats Gibsons purpose in showing one Mayan tribe attacking raping enslaving torturing bludgeoning stabbing spearing impaling eviscerating dissecting and decapitating the other Its a cautionary tale. According to Gibson the Spanish defeated the Mayans because they had become divided and decadent. And here I thought it had something to do with disease and the fact that the Spanish had things like you know guns. Yet ""Apocalypto"" has to be respected for the sheer audacity of it for the commitment and ambition behind it and for its presentation of a complete other world. It is the furthest thing from a cynical or casual piece of work. Its crazy and it moves. Everything bad that can happen happens and when it doesnt thats only because something even worse happens -- and in this way it keeps a hold on an audiences attention. To see ""Apocalypto"" is to come away feeling as though you really have watched for example an ancient decapitation rite with each head rolling down an immense staircase toward a cheering bloodthirsty throng. Whether you actually want to see this is up to you but youve never seen anything like it before and almost certainly never will again. As in ""The Passion of the Christ"" ""Apocalypto"" is filmed in the original language of the era in this case Mayan and as was the case with ""The Passion"" this has a positive effect on the actors liberating them from having to act stiff in order to suggest the remoteness of the era and the culture. Instead the culture is embodied in the language and the actors are free to behave naturally. The naturalness is charming in an early sequence in which we get a glimpse of peaceful Mayan life with young family man Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) coming home to his beautiful pregnant wife and his young son. But as in ""Braveheart"" the happy domestic interlude is really there only to make the slaughter feel personal. Jaguar Paw is one of a handful of young Mayan hunters who are introduced at the start but he gradually emerges as the films locus. During an attack on his village he successfully hides his family inside a dry well and once hes captured he has to figure out a way to make his way back so that he can rescue them. Along the way we see mainly through his eyes the hardships inflicted by the rival tribe. The enemys town square in which people gather to buy slaves at auction is a decadent spectacle of biblical proportions with images of greed larceny and gluttony everywhere. Its tempting to see this as Gibsons vision of the world as evil treacherous and heedless. The disrespect for life itself constitutes the ultimate decadence and thats on display in the aforementioned decapitation rite which in terms of scale is like something out of Griffiths ""Intolerance."" The onscreen crowds screaming affection for blood-sport rituals of the kind in which Gibson specializes is offered up as evidence that their culture is heading into the abyss. Hmm. Maybe Gibson has a point. -- Advisory This film contains nudity decapitations forced sex throat cuttings arrows in the neck arrows through the mouth and a scene in which a jaguar bites into a mans head. Sensitive viewers may find some of this disturbing.

Meet Apocalypto. It is at times a film of engrossing power and extraordinary craftsmanship. It is at times an exercise in sadism. It is at many times a stirring look at an ancient people on the eve of annihilation. And it is Mel Gibsons latest proof that as a director his ambition is boundless and his energy nearly so but his judgment is sorely lacking. With Apocalypto he seeks to awaken a long-slumbering civilization and for that he deserves commendation. Who else has the chutzpah to pack a mega-budget feature with unknowns then shoot the film entirely in Yucatec? Scholars may beef about the movies reduction of Mesoamerican history or the way it cribs from non-Mayan cultures (the Aztecs for instance) but its not like anyone can point to a more accurate Hollywood portrayal of the subject. Unless youre thinking of George Chakiris in Kings of the Sun. Didnt think so. Gibsons film follows Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) a young hunter whose village is destroyed by marauders from another Mayan tribe. In one brutally vivid sequence after another Jaguar Paw and his fellow captives are marched through the bush toward a bustling city of slave-trade and human sacrifice where a high priest decapitates young men in azure body paint and sends their heads bouncing down the steps of a pyramid. (Never will you look at terraced pyramids the same way again.) Through a stroke of luck or prophesy Jaguar Paw escapes this grisly fate. Other dangers loom as he tears back through the rain forest tattooed villains hot on his heels to rescue his pregnant wife and son from an empty well before it rains and they drown. Here the movie morphs into a single deadly chase -- as hunter becomes hunted hunted becomes hunter and Jaguar Paw tests and proves his moniker. Id be lying if I said I wasnt sucked in hard by Apocalypto. The films resurrection of a lost civilization its expressive cast and naturalistic performances (especially Youngbloods as the hell-bent protagonist and Jonathan Brewers as his grieving friend) its white-knuckle suspense and dazzling artistry (cinematography cityscapes piercings bangles and bones) All these elements bring an ancestral people to life with feral brawn. But somewhere between the jaguar mauling and the blunt head wound that sprays like a backyard sprinkler I lost it. My equilibrium. My tolerance for gore. My dinner almost. And its a big loss too because Gibsons Apocalypto is so close to being great that I wanted to throttle its director. I wanted to throttle him not for the usual gossip-rag rationale but because after Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ I have had it up to here with his ungodly fondness for bloodletting. It clouds his eye and defaces his films. I dont mean that theyre violent -- so are Martin Scorseses -- but that the violence itself is Gibsons objective a what-for why-for behind every creative choice. Even a soft-hearted thing like The Man Without a Face revealed a fetish for the aberrant and the deformed. There was plenty of both amid the Mayas but there was strapping beauty too -- a beauty that haunts moments of Gibsons film but never lingers. His camera too often dwells on ugliness. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Mini Bluetooth 4.0 In-Ear Headset for 4 + free shipping Banana Republic Final Cut Sale Up to 75% off + free shipping...

Last time around Crazy Mel had one man flogged for most of 126 minutes. This time with ""Apocalypto"" he flogs impales eviscerates spears crushes and beheads at least 126 men for 126 minutes. In the merrily sadistic world Gibson seems to be operating in these days thats called progress. ""When I catch him I will peel his skin and have him watch me wear it"" sneers a ruthless Mayan warrior. One imagines the days of ""What Women Want"" have come and gone. A panther eats a mans face. Silly kitty for in Mel World that only earns the panther a fatal clubbing - while still clinging to that unfortunate face - from the mans tribe. We see another man open his own wrists - bear with me here - because its a more pleasant way to die than what is about to happen to him. Hearts are plucked from chests like so many ornaments from a tree. Women give birth underwater while trapped in caves during torrential rainstorms. Did we mention the plague? Mel Gibson sure knows how to put the ""ick"" in biblical. ""Apocalypto"" is ""Snakes on a Plane"" if Hannibal Lecter were the pilot. Thanks to his efforts we can all face our demise with no possible form of fatality left undelineated. I fully intended to write a serious review of ""Apocalypto"" right up to the point where a 4-year-old boy closes his leg wound with the pincers of live fire ants. Gibsons relentless sadism is a new form of jumping the shark that forces the loyal viewer to either gag or giggle. ""The Passion of the Christ"" was a religious snuff film and ""Apocalypto"" is an anthropological snuff film. Either way a deep conversation afterward feels out of proportion to the artwork. What is the plot you ask? The plot is death. All must die some with arrows piercing ... oh never mind. The story line vaguely connects all these assaults through the tale of Jaguar Paw. Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) was minding his own business one year in the 15th century hunting tapirs and forcing his brother to eat tapir testes when invaders struck. Seems the Mayan warlords of the temple next door needed more slaves to sacrifice to the gods - see ""hearts plucked"" above - and Jaguar Paws tribe as they say on ESPN got next. Jaguar Paw is captured just after hiding his family down a cave - see ""underwater birth"" above - and is hauled with the remains of his tribe to the temple city. Gibsons allegedly deeper environmental message is here The ruthless Mayans are destroying the jungle and scarring the landscape with their acquisitive pestilence. A handy eclipse helps Jaguar Paw escape his route naturally taking him across a pit filled with rotting corpses. Our hero is then chased for an hour up trees down waterfalls and through quicksand. All this takes place in a native tongue interpreted for us by subtitles. Thus we can smile along with Mels mother-in-law jokes and erectile dysfunction jokes which really need no translation but must have sounded a lot funnier in ancient Mayan. Gibsons lamentable penchant for tin-eared frat-boy humor pops up elsewhere in the script including a subtitle that must be the first time in cinema history that a noble Mayan warrior drops an f-bomb. The film student in Gibson references plenty of other movies including ""Lord of the Flies"" and Terrence Malicks recent ""The New World."" But mostly Gibson references himself repeating almost shot for shot his own martyrdom in ""Braveheart"" and the cross-bearing scenes from ""Passion."" If Mel thinks everybody hates Mel his revenge is the pain inflicted on the spectator through countless graphic killings. ""Apocalypto"" may succeed with some audiences as there is no denying his films as technical tours de force. If nothing else Gibson understands like few other directors the brutal recipe of sight sound and adrenaline. There are many shots in his jungle that linger in the mind with a raw power not always attributable to sheer violence. But I doubt Id sit through it again if it wasnt required in the job description. ""Apocalypto"" wants us to believe there is an overpowering darkness in the land while I cant quite get past a suspicion of overpowering darkness in the filmmaker.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Apocalypto Recommended Mel Gibsons notorious tirade against Jews highlighted not only his bigotry but his preoccupation with tribal conflict which finds a more benign expression in this heart-pounding epic about the collapse of Mayan civilization. The production design is superb and the actors deliver their dialogue in subtitled Yucatecan Maya but despite all the anthropological drag this is really just a crackerjack Saturday-afternoon serial. After a jungle village is overrun by vicious Holcane warriors three friends are taken prisoner and marched over mountainous terrain to roiling Maya City to meet their horrible fate. An extended chase sequence in the latter half grows increasingly silly but the deus ex machina Gibson uses to resolve it is a masterstroke of historical wit. R 137 min. By J.R.

Co-produced by the companys Touchstone label it is an action epic co-written and directed by Mel Gibson whose directorial career has evolved into an essay in blood lust and gratuitous violence. CLIP Take a sneak peek at Apocalypto Gibsons Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ seemed to revel in explicit brutality. And with his latest film which superficially chronicles the decline of the Mayan civilization he has plunged into new realms of savagery. The story begins in the 16th century on what is meant to be a light note. A group of men hunt and kill a tapir. This being a Gibson movie the animal is impaled brutally not just speared. Theres a bit of comic relief more clownish than funny involving an infertile man persuaded by his fellow tribesmen to eat the tapirs testicles. Shortly thereafter these peaceful forest-dwellers are attacked by marauding Mayans. Most of the community is viciously attacked men and children are slain and women are raped. Several men are taken prisoner to be offered up to the gods. Among them is the films protagonist Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) who escapes and undertakes a perilous journey to be reunited with his family. Along the way theres a litany of barbaric acts filmed to their fullest shock potential. How can Gibson disgust us? Let us count the ways Theres a face chewed off by a panther a spear impaling a mans skull a chest ripped open by a blunt arrowhead and a head spurting blood as if a spigot has been turned on. Then there are the hundreds of rotting corpses that fill the screen for a few harrowing minutes. You cannot deny that Gibson is inventive in depicting torture. But watching it is excruciating despite some striking cinematography and Youngbloods expressive performance. The blood and guts obscure whatever power the story could have had. Certainly the Mayan civilization was not without violence. But the film doesnt even touch on significant Mayan contributions. Advances in mathematics astronomy science and writing are ignored in favor of a focus on the Mayans decadence and barbarism. For Gibson the Mayans seemed to have been all about decapitated heads and extracted still-beating hearts. The impressive temples they built appear to be of little consequence. Though the dialogue in the native language spoken by Mayan descendants in Central America does create a sense of authenticity the story itself seems like anthropology lite. We get just a glimpse of tribal customs as the movie devolves into a conventional chase film. What is missing is context. Why does everyone speak the same language if they had not had any prior contact? Or had they had contact but escaped somehow unscathed? We have no idea how long the forest-dwelling tribe has been living peacefully before they are attacked. The movie is so impressionistic it obfuscates any sense of history. We expect at least a hint at the causes of the Mayan Empires demise but instead we get Mesoamerican Rambo. Perhaps Gibson is trying to shock us into absorbing the torment and severity of mans inhumanity to man. The tragedy is that the film has the opposite effect As we are bombarded by savagery we become inured to it.

"Mel Gibsons Apocalypto reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Mel Gibsons Apocalypto reviewed. Mel Gibsons Apocalypto reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 7 2006 610 PM A Pre-History of Violence Mel Gibsons bloody bewildering Apocalypto. By Dana Stevens Rudy Youngblood in Apocalypto Here is a partial list of the indignities to which the human body is subjected in Mel Gibsons Mayan epic Apocalypto (Buena Vista) being impaled on a trap made of animal bones. Being forced to ingest tapir testicles. Being tricked into rubbing a caustic agent on ones own genitals while the whole village watches and laughs. Seeing ones father have his throat slit. Getting ones heart cut out in a sacrificial ritual. Having ones head subsequently chopped off and thrown down the stairs of a pyramid. Having ones face chewed off by a panther. The above catalog of harm only begins to hint at the dulling and eventually comic frequency of physical violence in Apocalypto which progresses as a series of static set pieces that are little more than narrative pretexts for graphically imagined anguish. Heres the story Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is a handsome young hunter who lives in a remote jungle village with his young son and pregnant wife (Dalia Hernandez). One fine day the bewildered remnants of a neighboring tribe straggle in warning that the villages bucolic way of life is in danger. Sure enough the next day brings a raid by fierce warriors who kidnap the tribes able-bodied men and take them on a long forced march to the city where they will be painted blue and lined up for human sacrifice. Jaguar Paw manages to hide his family in an abandoned well but will he manage to get back to them before they starve or worse fall into the hands of the sadistic captors? Advertisement For a good hour I tried to pretend that I had never heard of Mel Gibson the maker of fanatical blockbusters the spewer of hateful rants. I tried--really tried--to experience Apocalypto as an ethnographic thriller about an ancient culture. But though it may have been researched to within an inch of its life this film is not by any reasonable standard ethnography. It teaches us nothing about Mayan civilization religion or cultural innovations. (Calendars? Hieroglyphic writing? Some of the largest pyramids on Earth?) Rather Gibsons fascination with the Mayans seems to spring entirely from the fact (or fantasy) that they were exotic badasses who knew how to whomp the hell out of one another old-school. You dont leave Apocalypto thinking of the decline of civilizations or the power of myth or anything much except wow that is one sick son of a bitch. Though it never gains forward momentum until the final chase when the hero races against time to save his family from the rapidly filling well Apocalypto does have a weird and undeniable power. Watching human bodies narrowly escape a terrible fate--or as in most cases undergo it--is inherently compelling. The Mexico locations are breathtaking A chase scene at a roaring waterfall is so spectacular it makes Last of the Mohicans look like an Esther Williams musical. The film was shot by Dances With Wolves Dean Semler on the best-looking digital video Ive ever seen. And the final plot twist is a cleverly timed deus ex machina that opens the film out onto world history (while possibly presaging an even gorier sequel). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I could go on about the beautifully detailed production design the fresh performances from unknown and often nonprofessional actors blabbety blah. But praising the movies craftsmanship seems less urgent than communicating the overwhelming experience of watching it the clammy claustrophobic dread of being trapped in a torture chamber. Even the movies rare moments of humor are pain-based--see the above-mentioned scenes of tapir-ball ingestion and caustic crotch-burning both visited on the tribes comic foil Blunted (Jonathan Brewer). The sadomasochism gets more unintended laughs in other bits including an arterial head wound that spurts blood at intervals Monty Python and the Holy Grail-style. Myself I had to stifle a giggle when the bad guys got out a large leather kit full of torture tools--spears hatchets and the like. It looked like something you might purchase at a sex-goods shop in San Francisco. Apocalypto opens with a quote from Will Durant that seems to make a connection between the decline of Mayan civilization and the ills of the present day ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself."" Sounds deep but what are the parallels Gibson is suggesting between the decadence of the Mayan empire and our own? The films moral universe is too Manichean and self-contained to suggest any real allegory with current events. I think the movies real epigraph comes in another scene. As the kidnapped villagers slog along a narrow mountain path manacled together the last man in line slips over the cliff edge nearly dragging his fellow captives with him. Instructed by chief Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo) to cut the dangler loose from the pack the cruelest of the captors Snake Ink (Rodolfo Palacios) puts him off for a moment ""Lets see what happens."" Snake Ink it seems is perversely fascinated with the physics of suffering If the guy falls how many men will he take with him? What kind of splat will they make when they hit the ground? If he could just scrape together 80 million Snake Ink might have a movie on his hands. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Apocalypto Driven by A Hunters Gut Instincts washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Apocalypto Driven by A Hunters Gut Instincts Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 8 2006 ""Apocalypto"" turns out to be not a case of Montezumas revenge but of Mel Gibsons Its something entirely unexpected a sinewy taut poem of action. Brazenly politically incorrect it actually connects with another cult film of epic political incorrectness. Old-timers will immediately be put in mind of Cornel Wildes ""Naked Prey"" of 1966 a brilliant if racist classic in which the ""natives"" of an unnamed tribe capture a Briton on safari and after finding various colorful tortures for his companions decide to stalk him for sport. The movie then devolves to pure narrative as the valiant agile resilient tough-as-leather-bowstring hunter turns the tables on his pursuers. The same figure is at the center of ""Apocalypto"" A hunter being hunted who turns out to be equally valiant agile resilient and tough as leather bowstring. And like his British antecedent he hunts back. It isnt pretty except of course -- by the subversive rules of cinema -- it is especially when he puts spectacular coups de grace on the most savage of his pursuers. I liked the one where he cracks the guy in the skull with a bone-headed club and this little gurgle of blood almost dainty spurts out of the shattered skull. That was cool The scene and time demand some explication. Its Mexicos Yucatan Peninsula in vaguely pre-Columbian times in that seemingly endless epoch when the mighty Mayan city-states ruled supreme and took their pleasures from the land and surrounding peoples with no thought to consequence or brotherhood. They were rulers; everyone else was naked prey. Our hero is no city Maya however. He is one Jaguar Paw (brilliant supple expressive Rudy Youngblood) of an indigenous forest people. Certainly Gibson over-romanticizes this hunter-gatherer lifestyle. In a Potemkin village of surpassing beauty these happy children of innocence cavort like so many Rima the Bird Girls chattering in Yucatek (which subtitles translate into a kind of hardy peasant English bringing to mind Frodo and his mates) joking healthily about sex living in perfect monogamy in warm little family units under the watchful eye of the benevolent patriarch Flint Sky. Under it I could see folk memories of Middle Earth or even for Gods sake Winnetka. Gibson makes decisions to tell certain forgotten truths. The opening sequence depicts a team bringing down a tapir The movie gets not merely the necessity of the hunt and the agony of the beast but the exhilaration. And when these rangy guys begin the alchemy of butchery by which a corpse becomes meat Gibson forces you (PETA people not you ) to feel what they feel My name will be sung at the tribal fires tonight my children will go to bed with full bellies and I will probably get laid. But this is all about to end. One morning -- the portents have been over-dramatic -- the Mayans arrive in force. And why you wonder would the Forest People not even have heard of them and made no preparations as they are about two days march from a Mayan urban center? The only answer is that it suits the political agenda of the picture which is to subvert notions about the ""innocence"" of native peoples and the ""guilt"" of usurpers from the outside. In other words in Gibsons worldview the Mayans are to the Forest People exactly as sometime later the Spaniards would be to the Mayans. Its all a question of empire prerogative. The results are not pretty. Think of the attack on the village in ""Conan the Barbarian"" as if really directed by Conan the Barbarian. Gibsons view of the brutal coinage of human exchange well publicized in ""Jesus The Movie"" -- I mean ""The Passion of the Christ"" -- is on graphic display as slaughter is general and bloody and capture is debasing and grotesque. With the survivors secured by thong and neck brace the surviving children left to die the Mayans herd their captives off for disposal. This begins the films center passage a kind of tour of the hell that is the Mayan city-state. We see it from the dazzled captive outsiders point of view. It appears to be late in the day for Mayan rule as slash-and-burn agriculture has finally used up the land and so the elaborate trade routes between cities have withered. Plague has struck. The priest-kings of the Maya have turned to human sacrifice for salvation. The extent of Mesoamerican sacrifice has always been problematic The latest conclusion seems to be that both the Mayans and the Aztecs practiced it extensively though the Mayans not nearly as much as the Aztecs which prompts the question Why didnt Gibson make a movie about the Aztecs? In any event his portrayal of the urban lifestyle of the Mayan yuppie class will certainly raise hackles among the self-appointed enlightened even as it mesmerizes the unwashed. He conjures up a city built around genocide as religious ceremony and shows the swift deliverance of new victims to the temples their quick blue paint job (actually more of a cobalt-marine candy coating) and their arrival at the pinnacle of death. There each in turn is splayed backward over a ceremonial post his limbs secured by four priests while a fifth performs the myocardial interruption with a flint knife. Talk about the land of the brokenhearted The films version of Mayan culture is -- hmm what can you say? Its not overly opulent seemingly made mostly of ziggurats and shanties with no shopping malls or T.G.I. Fridays anywhere in sight. It reminded me a little of the place where Natalie Portman lived in one of the later ""Star Wars"" movies and all the women look a little Princess Padme Amidala. Its just a hair short of out-and-out kitsch and in some venues giggles and snorts will be heard though the tattoos are very cool and the Nefertiti hairdos all the rage. You can see where this is going but that doesnt really prevent you from enjoying it immensely. Jaguar Paw as it turns out is the messenger of the gods he who is specified in prophecy as harbinger of the end of days according to the movies official haunted-little-girl truth-speaker. Thus by various largely unbelievable contrivances he manages to escape which sets up the films last best hour. Gibson may not be much of a deep thinker -- and theres no reason why this part of this story couldnt have been set just about anywhere in the world where men kill men -- but hes a heck of a storyteller. The central device of the last hour of the film Jaguar Paws freedom run with a crew of Mayan thugs in hot pursuit is helped by two exceptionally strong almost demonic acting performances. As the Obersturmbannfuehrer in a jawbone hat with a fancy knife is Raoul Trujillo who exudes aristocratic sang-froid. Then theres Rodolfo Palacios as Snake Ink more of a weasel than a brute. A terrific actor he makes you see Snake Inks guile and wisdom warped sense of humor and his enjoyment of pain infliction as minor amusement strategy. To Snake Ink slitting a throat is kind of like buying a new tune for your iPod. It must be said that whatever its lumpy geopolitical agitprop Gibsons ""Apocalypto"" is the lowest maybe the best kind of -- this is a strange but necessary word for a film this bloody -- fun. It really goes like hell. Apocalypto (135 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme violence and gore and disturbing images. In Yucatek with English subtitles.

The possessory drumroll is a declaration a challenge a promise This is a movie by Mel Gibson pals in which everything one has ever loved hated been stirred by or hooted at in the mans repertoire to date (both on and off screen) looks even bigger and crazier. So let the buyer beware -- or be titillated. Gibsons preoccupation with torture rage psychosis faith male bonding (fear of) homosexuality sin redemption sadomasochism and for that matter the fate of the rain forest -- its all here in a movie for which Hieronymus Bosch might have drawn the storyboards. Without Mel Gibson Apocalypto would just be a violent exotic historical epic/action flick with a nebulous political message about the decline of a corrupt civilization and the need to seek as the script says ""a new beginning."" It would be a hullabaloo gone native a National Geographic grindhouse pic with subtitles about the impulse of men to destroy one another and the insatiable moviegoing appetite for visual novelty. But it would not feature a fellow chomping down on the testicles of a slaughtered animal a father slit open in front of his son a pregnant woman nearly drowning or an extended scene of human sacrifice in which heads roll down steep temple steps like bowling balls. And the nogginless bodies that remain would not be photographed in piles inspired by old Holocaust imagery. No my friends the Mel Gibson part of the marquee is crucial to the full...appreciation of this astonishing id-soaked work. And if ""astonishing id-soaked"" ends up in the ads then marketers have simplified my meaning. Rather than immediately attaching a value to the intensity of the spectacle Id prefer to talk about the spectacle itself which begins with the hunting of a wild boar for one pre-Columbian Mayan village. An impressive chieftain called Flint Sky (Morris Birdyellowhead an unknown actor like everyone else in the gigantic loinclothed and befeathered cast) leads a pride of local men on the expedition with his soulful son Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) close at hand. The kill is celebrated with the parceling out of body parts during which the aforementioned genitals are handed allegedly for medicinal consumption to Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) a hulking chap whose wife has yet to conceive a child. Laughter ensues when the ball-eating prescription turns out to be a classic Gibsonian prank involving threatened manhood and homoerotic roughhousing. Punkd Then the real slaughter begins and with it the movies frenzied race to a finish in geography that serves as a Bizarro World to the glories of Terrence Malicks The New World. The peaceful village is attacked by marauding Others (assuming Losts ancestral Others decorated their faces like Christmas oranges studded with cloves) who slaughter and torture with vivid inventiveness. Those who arent dead are captured among them soulful Jaguar Paw who stares with Jesus eyes. But before hes carted away the resourceful young man manages to hide his pregnant wife (Dalia Hernandez) and little son. The future is a grim one for the living Theyre replacement stock for the prevailing political rulers -- deciders who have decided that the gods demand human sacrifice and follow through in an orgy of sadism. The lingering depiction of this carnage marks one of Apocalyptos two climaxes and its a hideous sight something perilously close to porn. The movies final act -- Jaguar Paws escape from death his race back to try to save his family and his pursuit by crazed Mayans determined to stay the course (led by a terrifying Raoul Trujillo as head crazy) -- is as elemental in its goals as anything out of the Mad Max yarns or Braveheart. The message may be that were all members of a rotting civilization. Or it may be that pregnant women can do miraculous things. Never let it be said that Gibson the director (he also co-wrote the script with former assistant Farhad Safinia) doesnt know how to pace and build action like a pro. Freed from the roadblocks inevitable in telling the story of say Jesus crucifixion the movie barrels and lunges on jaguar paws itself. But never forget either that theres so much dark material jammed into this complicated conflicted challenging and charismatic mans own noggin that sometimes he knows not I think what hes done. Here behold Mel Gibson has made the weirdest most violent movie of the year.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Even if his name werent on the title anyone familiar with his oeuvre would be able to recognize ""Mel Gibsons Apocalypto"" as the work of the creator of ""The Passion of the Christ"" though here he foregoes Aramaic for the Yucatec language spoken by the descendants of the Mayans.Once again he returns to his favorite theme nearly naked men being tortured. Repeatedly. Imaginatively. At great length. ""Apocalypto"" however begins on a light note the trapping and graphic impalement of a tapir on a fence of spikes. Next comes a jocular moment in which the hunters--a tribe of peaceful forest dwellers in Mesoamerica circa 1517--trick one of their members into eating the dead animals severed testicles. It isnt long before comedy is cast aside and true horror descends the tribe which lives in harmony with nature is invaded by marauding torch-bearing tattooed Mayans who set huts on fire club and knife many of the women and children to death and imprison the men including the films wounded and bloodied young hero Jaguar Paw (Richard Youngblood). Along with his fellow tribesmen Jaguar Paw is shackled to a pole and forced to endure a long sadistic march to the Mayans city where an even crueler fate awaits them.""Apocalypto"" begins with an intriguing quote from Will Durant ""A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within."" This might lead you to expect an exploration of the erosion and extinction of the mighty Mayan empire. But this is not to be. The only aspects of the Mayans culture that fire Gibsons imagination are the blood sacrifices held atop their imposing stone pyramids. The victims blood is meant to appease the gods and end the drought and disease plaguing the land. The director spares us no detail of this exotically savage ritual as our captive tribe members are painted blue and held down on a stone slab while to the cheering mobs below their beating hearts are carved out of their chests and held aloft (page 14). This is followed by swift decapitation and the spectacle of severed heads tossed down the steps followed by the headless carcasses. The director wants you to know he disapproves of this. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Jaguar Paw manages to escape the High Priests dagger but more dangers await as pursued by soldiers he tries to wend his way home where his pregnant mate Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and son are trapped in the bottom of a pit. In its second even gorier half ""Apocalypto"" becomes a straight-ahead chase movie with more cliffhangers than ""The Perils of Pauline."" Some of this is quite thrilling. Gibson has formidable filmmaking skills he knows how to direct a bravura action scene and he and his co-writer Farhad Safina are inexhaustibly inventive in conjuring fresh ways for victims to meet their end. Dramatically however the relentless pileup of atrocities becomes self-defeating. At a certain point--was it the spear that went from the back of a running mans head through his mouth? The jaguar tearing another mans face to shreds? The snakes? The hornets? The hundreds of rotting corpses in the ravine?--you become inured. The harder ""Apocalypto"" works to shock and excite you the less shocked and excited you become until you may find yourself beset by the urge to giggle. Some may find the overkill exploitative but theres nothing cynical about Gibsons obsession with blood and pain. The pathology is genuine.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Mel Gibson is always good for a surprise and his latest is that ""Apocalypto"" is a remarkable film. Set in the waning days of the Mayan civilization the picture provides a trip to a place ones never been before offering hitherto unseen sights of exceptional vividness and power. In the wake of its directors recent outburst and unwanted publicity commercial prospects remain anyones guess and those looking for a reason not to attend will undoubtedly find one be it Gibsons tirade the gore the subtitles or outre subject matter. But blood-and-guts action audiences should eat this up Gibson is courting Latinos eco-political types will like the message and at least part of the massive ""The Passion of the Christ"" crowd should be curious so strong biz is possible if these distinct constituencies are roused. Despite the subjects inherent spectacle conflict and societal interest Central Americas pre-Columbian history has scarcely been touched by filmmakers; Hollywoods only venture into the territory was the little-remembered 1963 quasi-epic ""Kings of the Sun"" with Yul Brynner and George Chakiris. Cast largely with indigenous nonpros speaking the prevailing surviving dialect of the Mesoamericans ""Apocalypto"" is exotic wild ferocious teeming with startling incident and brutal violence. With co-screenwriter Farhad Safinia Gibson has cooked up a scenario that is fundamentally a survival and chase film with a final act that trades on the human hunt motif of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and Cornel Wildes ""The Naked Prey."" But both the grand conception of a civilization in decline and the extraordinary detail with which the society is presented make the picture much more than that to the extent that it startlingly echoes another portent-laden year-end release Alfonso Cuarons ""Children of Men;"" one film is set in the past the other in the near-future one was made in Mexico by a Yank-Aussie the other in Britain by a Mexican but both are contemporaneously resonant stories of pursuit through poisoned dangerous lands on the brink. Starting at a run and seldom stopping for a breather pic opens on an animal hunt that occasions a graphically gross two-prong practical joke that instantly humanizes the characters. It establishes the relaxed intimate sensual nature of family-oriented life in a small jungle settlement occupied by the fearsome-looking but free-spirited protags. Chief among them is Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) an athletic young man who has long flowing locks sports tattoos designed body scars large ear adornments and a sort of chin plug and wears nothing but a well-fitted loin cloth. His teeth are not quite as bad as those of his pals which are very bad indeed. Paradise comes to an abrupt end a half-hour in with the dawn attack of marauders who pillage with ruthless expertise. These guys are more heavily decorated than the locals with bones through their noses and elsewhere. Two members of what the press notes identify as Holcane warriors stand out the leader Zero Wolf (the supremely imposing Raoul Trujillo) whose left arm and head are festooned with human and animal jaws and the sadistic Snake Ink (Rodolfo Palacios fantastically hateful) who restrained from killing Jaguar Paw by Zero Wolf instead murders the captives father in front of him launching an antagonism that runs through the picture. Both of these heavies could stay in costume and stride straight into another ""Mad Max"" film. With his surviving fellow villagers Jaguar Paw is bound and marched off through the jungle but not before hes secreted his very pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and little son (Carlos Emilio Baez) in a deep pit promising rather against the odds to return. The greatest mystery surrounding the Mayan civilization is why it collapsed so suddenly. Gibson adroitly lines his film with hints of the numerous possible causes including famine disease drought increased warfare a corrupt ruling class and general societal breakdown. A bedraggled group of emaciated natives is glimpsed moving through the forest early on and the prisoners later pass by a haunted girl with ""the sickness"" who warns about the coming ""blackness of day."" The long central section of ""Apocalypto"" is simply great epic cinema with generous dollops of chilling horror and grisly human sacrifice. Production designer Tom Sanders makes a huge contribution to the captives gradual entry into the great and chaotic Maya City. Each neighborhood is brilliantly detailed from the derelict outlying shantytown to the industrial and more prosperous commercial districts the slave market where the women are sold off and finally the staggering central plaza where the first thing seen is a freshly detached human head being bounced down the long steps of a towering pyramid toward a frenzied crowd below. Only then does it dawn on the shackled prisoners whats in store for them. At the summit preside dissolute royals as well as a high priest who time and again plunges a knife into a mans belly and while the victim is still alive tears out his still-beating heart as an offering to placate the gods to end the drought. It takes a freakish act of nature to save Jaguar Paw but he and the few other survivors are quickly made objects of sport in an arena from which commences the long and eventful chase of Jaguar Paw by Zero Wolf and his minions back through the jungle. Double-whammy ending tips over into undue melodrama that some may find risible and one aspect of the climax establishes the films time frame as much later in Mayan history than one might have guessed. Notwithstanding the fantastic sets costumes makeup body and hair designs and natural locations perhaps the greatest impression is made by the performers faces which are superbly photogenic and unlike any normally seen in movies. The attractive agile Youngblood carries the film with room to spare and is entirely convincing in his many dramatic moments as well as in the intense action. Casting director Carla Hool rates a huge bonus for tracking down the people who play everyone from the most savage looking warriors to the paralyzingly weird female aristocrats in the city. One notable aspect of the characterizations is the general attitude toward death. The Mayans as portrayed here naturally fear it like anyone but they accept it just as they acknowledge physical pain as an everyday aspect of life. They are utterly without sentimentality tears or remorse; when one is about to die another will sincerely tell them ""Travel well"" and that is that. Blood and violence is abundant but doesnt feel exaggerated or out of line in relation to the material. Production is a wonder. Dean Semlers camera moves relentlessly through the densest of foliage and over the roughest of terrain on locations near Veracruz and in the rainforests of Catemaco with some additional shooting done in Costa Rica and the U.K.; Gibson clearly knew the impact the lenser of the second and third ""Mad Max"" films could deliver. More remarkable still is that pic was shot on the new high definition Genesis camera system. Without a doubt ""Apocalypto"" is the best-looking big-budget film yet shot digitally; one cant tell it wasnt shot on film. James Horner composed an uncharacteristically low-key and moody score full of threatening choral-like synthesizer growling woodwind interludes and alarming percussive strikes.
