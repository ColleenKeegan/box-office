Based on the true-life book ""Stung"" by Gary Stephen Ross the film chronicles the facts of the case of a Toronto bank vice president who stole more than 10 million from his employer over a two-year period in the early 1980s. All of that money funded his expanding gambling addiction ending up in the pockets of bookies and the vaults of casinos. In Owning Mahowny by the time the lead character is caught the concept of losing (or winning) 1000000 in one night is acceptable. But Owning Mahowny isnt really about how the police closed the noose around the mans neck. Instead its a character study and an examination of addiction. The two go hand-in-hand. In order to understand Dan Mahowny (played brilliantly by Philip Seymour Hoffman) you have to come to grips with his addiction and vice versa. The two are inseparable. For Mahowny gambling isnt a diversion a passion or even an obsession. It is a necessity. He cannot survive without it. When a psychologist asks him to quantify on a scale of 1 to 100 what the most excitement he has ever had gambling is he responds ""100."" When asked the same question about excitement away from gambling he replies ""20."" Owning Mahowny is not a feel-good story about one mans ability to overcome addiction. Instead it illustrates a deepening spiral of compulsive behavior withdrawl from society and denial. In this case gambling is the root cause but the same movie could be made about a man caught in the grip of drugs alchohol sex or anything else. For Mahowny gambling isnt about winning or losing. Those things are incidental as is the money needed to play. The high and the need are about playing the game and taking the risk. Winnings are merely ways to prolong the experience. In the end everything will be lost - its just a matter of how long it takes. The film opens with Mahowny in debt for 10300 to a local bookie Frank Perlin (Maury Chaykin). When he learns that he is being cut off until he can pay back the money Mahowny becomes desperate. So he starts fudging accounts and creating fake loan applications. Soon he has access to a nearly endless line of credit - enough to fund expensive binges trips to Atlantic City and Las Vegas and to wager on nearly every sporting event taking place in North America. (""Bet on all the home teams in the National League and all the away teams in the American League"" he says at one point.) His gambling has driven a rift between him and his mousy girlfriend Belinda (Minnie Driver). When he spends all of their ""romantic"" weekend in Vegas at the tables rather than with her she realizes the seriousness of his problem. At work no one seems to figure out what is happening. His bosses are pleased with his work ethic and he even passes an audit. The film also offers some degree of insight into the insidious things that casinos do to appease their high rollers and keep the money flowing. The windows are tinted so it looks gray and unappealing outside. Oxygen is pumped in to create a high. Rooms drinks food shows and prostitutes are on the house. The spider at the center of the Atlantic City web ensnaring Mahowny is Victor Foss (John Hurt) who has all the charm of a snake oil salesman. Hes a predator and Mahowny realizes it but doesnt care. At first Victor fails to notice Mahowny but when his losses cross into the six-figure range things change. Soon Victor is wooing Mahowny with countless amenities but the gambler turns down a woman and barely notices the bigger suite with three washrooms. All he wants are some ribs (without sauce) and a Coke. Victor is delighted. ""A purist"" he exults. Central to the films success is the quality of acting. The role of Dan Mahowny is a standout from Philip Seymour Hoffman best known to date for his scene-stealing supporting performances in Paul Thomas Anderson movies (those guys with two first names have to stick together). As was true last year in a pair of independent features The Good Girl and One Hour Photo a forceful and uncompromising portrayal by the lead actor can elevate the project from intriguing to compelling. Thats what happens here. Hoffman dressed like a slob and looking like a nerd draws us into Mahownys single-mindedness and shows the world through the characters tunnel vision. Even for those who admired Hoffman beforehand this is a revelation. In view of Hoffmans dominating performance there isnt much room for the other actors. John Hurt (who starred in director Richard Kwietniowskis Love and Death on Long Island) offers a deliciously reptilian turn as the casino director who wants to squeeze every last cent out of Mahowny. Theres a wonderful scene in which Victors boss approaches him during a Mahowny winning streak and warns him that the casino could be in trouble. ""Come back to me at 4 a.m. and ask me how were doing"" he advises with the confidence of one who understands the mindset of his prey. While Hurt makes the most of limited screen time the same cannot be said of Minnie Driver who is underutilized in an underwritten part. Movies about men caught in the grip of an addiction are never pleasant to watch. But they are powerful and often instructive. Owning Mahowny is such a motion picture. It works for two reasons (1) it understands the nature and patterns of addiction and doesnt try to blunt or soften them to appeal to an audience and (2) it doesnt cop out with a happy ending. Add to that a brilliant performance by Hoffman and you have a motion picture that never ceases to be worthwhile.

Directed by Jacques Perrin. (G. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Most movies slip out of our consciousness like water off a ducks back but the Oscar-nominated documentary ""Winged Migration"" stays in the mind changing the way we look at the world. Using gliders hot-air balloons and remote- controlled planes the movie takes audiences into the sky as it traces the migration paths of birds who fly thousands of miles in spring and fall in search of congenial weather. Its a privileged view. We get to see close-up what its like to fly over long distances across oceans and into rain and snow. Sometimes the birds just hold out their wings and glide but for the most part flying is revealed to be a physically exhausting activity a kind of light aerobics done for hours on end even days. To see this film is to forever look at geese with respect. They know things we dont know. Director Jacques Perrin is best known as an actor. (He played the middle- aged Salvatore the world-famous director who comes home to Sicily in the last segment of ""Cinema Paradiso."") But in recent years he has been making amazing nature films including ""Microcosmos"" a documentary about insects and ""Himalaya"" a dramatic feature about the ""salt men"" of Tibet starring real- life Tibetan salt men. Like Perrins other films ""Winged Migration"" is in the watching of it alternately stunning and dull -- theres a whole lot of flapping going on for 85 minutes. Yet days later the movie crystallizes in the mind and becomes truly splendid. In a way its an experience akin to travel something thats fine in the moment but only afterward reveals itself as a jewel -- a consciousness-broadening experience that thereafter feels indispensable. It took five crews three years (July 1998 to June 2001) to gather the footage which spans 40 countries and seven continents. Some of it is amazing. In one scene geese are flying in the middle of the ocean and see a battleship. As Perrin explains in voice-over anything resembling land is a chance for birds to catch a rest and so the geese swoop down on the deck of the ship and take a nap. There are poignant moments as when a group of penned-up farm birds look up with consternation at the sight of a migrating flock overhead. The movie doesnt shy away from the harsh side of nature although the most dispiriting moment in the film is a human one Just when it seems safe a pack of North American geese is shot up by morons in hunting hats who blast at them with high-powered rifles. To the birds theres no appreciable difference between a (pre-Sept. 11) New York harbor and the Seine. Theyre both just stops along the way. That doesnt make these real differences any less significant. On the contrary it reminds us of how little humans and birds know of each others worlds. ""Winged Migration"" is just a peek into the birds view of things and its a precious one. -- Mick LaSalle OWNING MAHOWNY Drama. Starring Philip Seymour Hoffman Minnie Driver and John Hurt. Directed by Richard Kwietniowski. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . ""Owning Mahowny"" is a fascinating fact-based portrait of gambling addict Dan Mahowny a Canadian bank manager who financed his addiction in the early 1980s through embezzlement. He created phantom loan accounts and juggled figures keeping his scam alive for two years -- and to the tune of 10 million. As played by Philip Seymour Hoffman Mahowny is the picture of blandness. He dresses in cheap suits drives a beat-up old car and lives in a nondescript apartment with lousy furniture. Money is not for buying things. Its for gambling. Hoffman portrays Mahowny as emotionally sealed off a man with no interests and no pleasures a kind of dead soul who needs the stimulus of the gambling table to feel alive. Playing bland can often be the same thing as being bland but there are subtleties in Hoffmans performance that will reward attentive viewers. Note the way he holds the dice when hes throwing sevens. Then note the way he holds them throwing craps. Its different. Though always impassive Mahowny is perceptibly different in his winning and losing modes. Hes not a systematic gambler but a reckless self-destructive one. ""Give me all the home teams in the National League and all the away teams in the American"" he mumbles to his bookie (Maury Chaykin). He plays tens of thousand of dollars a hand at blackjack. His high-stakes playing makes him a popular man with an Atlantic City casino manager (John Hurt) who doesnt suspect that Mahowny is throwing away stolen money. The story has its tense moments but its the character study that keeps the eyes glued. We know watching Hoffman that something is welling up inside this bottled-up man and that its coming out in the act of gambling. Not in his demeanor while gambling -- that remains unchanged -- but in the act of gambling itself. Its the scream of a man whos never learned to raise his voice. The stakes yes but not his voice. . This film contains sexual situations and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle POKEMON HEROES Animated adventure. Starring Veronica Taylor  Eric Stuart and Rachael Lillis . Directed by Kunihiko Yuyama and Jim Malone . Written by Hideki Sonoda and Jim Malone. (G. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . The last Pokemon movie -- the fourth in the series -- taught the adorable characters a brand-new trick. They laid an egg. The 1999 original based on the wildly popular Game Boy games pulled in a cool 85 million and a franchise was born. But the last one ""Pokemon 4Ever"" was a dreadful dull story that featured the equivalent of kids ordering their pets to attack each other. That snoozer barely dented the box office window earning less than 2 million. This one is likely to do better for several reasons. First theyve jazzed up the animation. The backgrounds appear to be digital and they are striking. The story is also less violent and combative concentrating on how Ash Ketchem and his shower toy pet Pikachu solve a mystery in a city that resembles Venice. The improved animation works best with the new characters Latios and Latias who take the kids on an underwater trip through the canals. However the best addition may be two new villains Annie and Oakley. Even the pre- kindergarten Pokemon audience will recognize them as the snotty kids who think they are cuter and cooler than anyone else. When those two get their comeuppance it is a satisfying moment for all ages. But the real advantage this movie has is that ""Pokemon Heroes"" comes out -- in a stunning coincidence -- just as two new Game Boy games hit the shelves Pokemon Ruby and Pokemon Sapphire. No wonder it is called it Pokemon USA Inc. Oh and by the way even if this one tanks dont worry that little Pikachu will have to start hitting the casting calls. Pokemon six has already been released in Japan. . Mild violence and characters captured by villains. -- C.W. Nevius IN THE MIRROR OF MAYA DEREN  Documentary. Directed by Martina Kudlacek (Not rated. 103 minutes. At the Red Vic Movie House through May 20.) . In experimental film circles Maya Deren is considered the high priestess nonpareil. Her films including the masterpiece ""Meshes in the Afternoon"" introduced a kind of moving visual poetry to the screen -- and opened the door for mavericks such as Kenneth Anger James Broughton and Stan Brakhage. ""In the Mirror of Maya Deren"" a documentary by Austrian filmmaker Martina Kudlacek not only celebrates Derens cinematic legacy but also reveals a gifted talent whose explosive temperament was at odds with the lyrical dreamlike imagery she put on screen. She was born Eleanora Derenkovskaya in Kiev Ukraine in 1917 and emigrated to the United States at age 5 with her psychiatrist father and musician mother. She abbreviated her last name and adopted the first name Maya the name of the Buddhas mother and the word for ""veil of illusion"" in Hindu mythology. She married three times first to a Russian socialist next to fellow filmmaker Alexander Hammid and last to a Japanese musician who was 18 years her junior. Short wide-hipped with a full head of bushy hair Deren was the kind of unbridled personality who would dance wildly at parties challenging the other guests to join her in pursuit of some purifying transcendence. ""Maya was always on fire"" the late actress Judith Malina says. ""She had some intensity that never stopped sizzling."" Once when she was asked to perform a Haitian wedding ceremony at a friends nuptials and then thwarted at the last minute Deren flew into a rage. ""Nobody believes me but I saw it"" Brakhage says. ""She hurled a refrigerator from one corner of the kitchen to another."" In 1961 after years of being unable to finish a film Deren died of a brain hemorrhage at 44. Some blamed it on the amphetamine-spiked ""Doctor Feelgood"" injections that she self-administered others on the Haitian practice of vodun that she studied and wrote about in the book ""The Divine Horsemen The Living Gods of Haiti."" ""When an artist has powers like (hers)"" Brakhage says ""if those get outside of the work process it can kill you. I fervently believed thats what killed Maya."" The material here is fascinating and Kudlacek serves it best when she gets out of the way and lets the story tell itself through Derens film images and the testimony of friends and colleagues. But Kudlacek makes a huge mistake in overlaying clips from Derens work with audio recordings of her lectures in which she lays out her aesthetic intentions in dense academic terms. It seems like a major violation -- not because the language misrepresents the films but because the films were meant to be experienced purely like music without filters or outside noise. -- Edward Guthmann HOUSE OF FOOLS Comedy. Starring Julia Vysotsky  Bryan Adams . Directed and written by Andrei Konchalovsky . (R. 108 minutes. In Russian with English subtitles. At the Opera Plaza). . Pop singer Bryan Adams has taken on his most curious project since that duet with Barbra Streisand. Adams appears in fantasy sequences as the dream date of a Chechen mental patient in ""House of Fools"" an ill-conceived comedy that gets hokier from that point. Accomplished Russian filmmaker Andrei Konchalovsky (""Runaway Train"") misfires remarkably with ""House of Fools"" which is ruined from the start by its insulting depiction of mental illness. Set in a psychiatric hospital on the Chechen border in 1996 the movie is based on a true story which hardly seems possible given its outsize shenanigans. The inmates are oblivious to war around them mostly because theyre busy being ""eccentric."" The idea of hilarious in ""House of Fools"" is a dwarf laughing maniacally as he runs down the hall or patients doing awkward calisthenics to accordion music. The actors chew the scenery and drool while they do it. Arent mentally ill people just so wacky? Julia Vysotsky plays the besotted Adams fan who believes the pop star is going to marry her. The lovely vivacious Vysotsky adopts a lisp and knocks her knees but her character doesnt seem disturbed as much as young and starry-eyed. If falling for Adams gravelly tones constitutes psychosis then half the girls who grew up in the 1980s could have been committed. Things get a bit more tolerable once the Chechen soldiers take over the hospital and the movie captures some casual ironies of war like the Russian and Chechen captains discovering they fought side by side in Afghanistan or the Chechen soldiers bartering arms for marijuana with their Russian counterparts. Konchalovsky dives into pathos midway through when Vysotskys character takes to heart a Chechen soldiers facetious offer of marriage and her ward mates dress her for a wedding. Its hard to tell whos being more patronizing here the soldier or the director. . This film contains nudity graphic images of war. -- Carla Meyer Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 7 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 10 Parilia Ball - San Francisco orgiastic event from almost a...

RELATED STORIES How it breaks down Superheroes rule the summer Sequels and spinoffs Good movies for grown-ups Faves for the family For everyone Guns and a green guy Arthouse offerings Cannibals and nuns Also openingThe Dancer Upstairs Javier Bardem and Laura Morante star in The Dancer Upstairs John Malkovichs directorial debut. He has played the blind boarder in Places in the Heart a comical robot in Making Mr. Right and an assassin in In the Line of Duty. Given this eclectic array movie buffs could almost have a party game guessing which project John Malkovich might choose as his directorial debut. The Dancer Upstairs is the answer a drama about political corruption in an unnamed Latin American country. It has an elusive haunting quality but its too long at 133 minutes and there arent many movies these days that get more involving as they progress. A disillusioned former lawyer (Javier Bardem) now a police investigator wonders why dead dogs are hanging from telephone poles with oblique revolutionary slogans attached to them. His superiors take the case out of his hands because they have a more prudent solution Bring in the military to steam-roll dissidents. In an adjacent story line that eventually melds into the primary one Bardem is taken by his young daughters ballet instructor (Laura Morante the pretty mom in last years The Good Father). Bardem who got an Oscar nomination for 2000s Before Night Falls marvelously underplays here as a man getting resigned to lifelong weariness in both his personal and professional lives. Dancer also gets one of the biggest boosts from its score by Albert Iglesias than any movie in a while. The movie begins and ends with the radio broadcast of a concert preceded by chatter from an initially unidentified vocalist Its Nina Simone who died last week and does a grabber rendition here of Sandy Dennys great Who Knows Where the Time Goes. (In selected cities. R strong violence and language) -- Mike Clark Blue Car Reviews of the movies The Dancer Upstairs (out of four) Blue Car Raising Victor Vargas Owning Mahowny Primarily a character study Blue Car has the feel of a novel in which the characters linger in ones memory well after the book has been read. Director Karen Moncrieff whose acting credits are largely in soap operas artfully avoids the melodramatic touches of that genre in this story of a high school senior with a troubled home life and a talent for writing. Agnes Bruckner does a lovely job as Meg attempting to cope with her parents divorce. Meg also has a sad little sister Lily (Regan Arnold) with burgeoning mental illness. Agnes is no goody-goody (she has shoplifted) but shes not a bad kid either. Shes mostly searching for someone she can trust. Her dedicated English teacher Mr. Auster (David Strathairn) seems to fit the bill. He empathetically encourages her to ""dig deeper"" and work through her emotional pain through poetry. Ultimately though he is not trustworthy and exploits her vulnerability. The talented but underappreciated Strathairn takes an unsympathetic role and gives it complexity creating a character that feels chillingly real. Bruckner and Arnolds performances are heart-wrenchingly understated. The only weak links are the adult actresses Frances Fischer is almost a caricature as Austers brittle wife and Margaret Colin as the girls mother seems oddly blank. But Blue Car is like an unpolished sapphire at once harshly realistic and resplendent. (Opens today in Los Angeles and New York; R sexual content and language) -- Claudia Puig Raising Victor Vargas In low-budget filmmaking casting can make the crucial difference between a nice try and a movie that can tickle the spirits enough to break out into something more. Raising Victor Vargas has landed exactly the right actors for a script that already gets points for respecting its teenage characters. Written and directed by Peter Sollett as an expansion on an award-winning short film he made at NYU Victor has a handsome lead (Victor Rasuk) playing a 16-year-old with obvious appeal. He has experienced enough disappointments in his limited life experiences to affect his swagger. A self-perceived romancer he is saved by the bell from getting involved with a neighborhood girl with a lousy rep and nickname Fat Donna. Victor then sets his sights on Judy (Judy Marte). She too is more vulnerable than one might think despite looks that drive the male locals a little nuts. The movie would like to get them together but Victors grandmother/guardian (Altagracia Guzman as memorable as the young players) gets in the way. No ogre and in fact loving she is rigid old-fashioned and worried. Shed like to throw Victor out in the street for encouraging his kid brother to masturbate but the law doesnt seem to be on her side. The movie keeps you guessing right up to the end a wait made pleasurable thanks to cinematographer Tim Orr. As he has proved with his films for David Gordon Green (George Washington All the Real Girls) budgets are not always the sole determiner of whether a movie is going to look good. (In selected cities. R strong language) -- M.C. Owning Mahowny A study of a compulsive gambler Owning Mahowny is made interesting by the performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman. Set in 1982 Mahowny is based on a true story of a mild-mannered Canadian banker who embezzled massive amounts from his company during a profitable era of minimal scrutiny. Hoffmans fine performance is the centerpiece surrounded by powerful portrayals by John Hurt as a casino owner and Maury Chaykin as a two-bit bookie. Minnie Driver plays Mahownys bank-teller girlfriend made to look frumpy with oversize glasses. Her Canadian accent is awkward and her portrayal lackluster. There are some effectively suspenseful moments in the movie particularly during the gambling sequences but one longs for more context and probing into the psyche of an ordinary man with an extraordinary compulsion.
