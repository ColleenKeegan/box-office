E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + So nonchalant is ""Resident Evil Afterlife the fourth movie in Paul W.S. Andersons dystopian franchise that its overarching premise isnt explained. The plague of undead swarming the planet is a fact of life. Theyre annoying to be swatted like pesky flies though its best to use an Uzi.In the previous flicks Alice the heroine played by surly and svelte Milla Jovovich developed superpowers (and clones) thanks to some uh mutation or other plot hole. In case you missed the back story the nefarious Umbrella Corporation accidentally let loose a genetic experiment the T-virus intended to prolong life. Its unfortunate side-effect? It reanimates dead cells. Hence the zombie apocalypse.But poor Alice. This time around her awesomeness has been taken away by Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) the baddie because he wears sunglasses and speaks in a vaguely British accent.They fight and a now-mortal Alice escapes commandeers an airplane and meets old buddy Claire Redfield (Ali Larter conveniently suffering from amnesia). An enigmatic radio signal leads them to whats left of Los Angeles.Buzzing over a smoldering H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D sign (nice touch) Alice and Claire land on the roof of a prison where survivors -- actors and producers in tight tank tops -- hold back a tide of undead. The posse escapes blazing its way to an offshore tanker possibly home to more survivors and definitely home to grosser stuff like zombie Dobermans whose heads split open to reveal toothy tentacles.As with each iteration of a PlayStation or Xbox game youd expect the next movie-franchise sequel to offer surprising plot zigzags and state-of-the-art visual effects. No such luck with ""Resident Evil Afterlife. Anderson goes for the hat trick producing directing and writing this one after letting others helm the two previous episodes. His camera suffers from ADHD shifting its perspective constantly and his slow-motion action scenes recycle that freeze/pause bullet-dodging effect we saw in ""The Matrix a decade-plus ago. The passe 3-D trickery -- snow throwing stars -- doesnt win you over either.But for films based on video games these deficits arent necessarily deal breakers. The target audience (gamers) wants to see Alice dash flip and blast through zombie-killing scenarios. Just like in the game Point shoot move to the next room.""Resident Evil Afterlife satisfies this craving. The undead explode in hails of bullets and manic jets of blood. Violence equals redemption and hope for the human race. All the while Alices pale makeup and ruby-red lipstick remain intact. Even in the apocalypse a gals war paint is sweat-proof.Ethan Gilsdorf can be reached at ethanethangilsdorf.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company. Thought you might like ...

Comments (1) Resident Evil Afterlife Video Rated R  96 minutes  2010 True to series form plot is nearly indiscernible but this fourth installment in the sci-fi/horror/action franchise created by writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson is the sleekest so far thanks to 3D and star Milla Jovovichs body-hugging catsuit. In a spectacular opening sequence the gun-toting heroine and an army of her clones invade the Tokyo headquarters of her nemesis the Umbrella Corporation engineer of the virus that has turned most of humankind into flesh-eating zombies. The rest of the film doesnt maintain that energy level but offers passable escapism as Jovovich flies down the North American Pacific coast in search of fabled Arcadia a disease-free community. Amid an LA aflame and teeming with the undead she finds a small band of survivors holed up in an old prison; now the good guys have to break out before the zombies break in.

(Oops)Alice and various groups of survivors have been fighting the Umbrella - you know The Man - ever since. The battle became interesting when Alice was injected with the virus and became a super-duper superheroine then began cloning herselfResident Evil Afterlife opens with a breathtaking spectacularly orchestrated sequence in which Alice and her army of Alices storm Umbrellas Tokyo headquarters. Its a delightful lightning-fast action sequence that captures the video-game experience.The rest is naught but a sad slide into mediocrity.Director - and Jovovich husband - Paul W.S. Anderson breaks our hearts first by killing off all the Alice clones then strips Alice of all her cool superhuman powers. (Speaking of stripping Alice remains conspicuously clothed throughout the flick.)The paint-by-numbers plot has Alice find a new group of survivors holed up in a prison in Los Angeles. (Yes were shown a tattered burnt-out ""Hollywood"" sign.)Inevitably Alices new pals die one by one and the film ends with a cliffhanger.Resident Evil Afterlife lacks the humanity - interesting characters funny one-liners - that made its predecessors enjoyable B-movies. All we have here are senseless and ultimately boring killings.Worst of all in Shawn Roberts the film has one of the most uncharismatic unmemorable archvillains in history.Time was Id follow Alice to the corners of the world.Alas not anymore.

"Movie review Resident Evil Afterlife - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Video_gamesMovie review Resident Evil AfterlifeYou know what youre getting Zombie violence and Milla Jovovich kicking butt.September 11 2010|By Michael Ordona Special to the Los Angeles Times One thing ""Resident Evil"" honcho Paul W.S. Anderson has figured out about his franchise Once the train leaves the station its best not to make any stops. His new installment (fourth as writer-producer second as director) ""Resident Evil Afterlife"" is an express to Monstertown on tracks greased with zombie entrails. For those not steeped in the gory legend risen from the popular video games Milla Jovovich plays Alice former operative and now arch-nemesis of the Umbrella Corporation. As the name implies the company covers it all in the field of malevolence a even after it accidentally launches a plague that essentially wipes out humanity it keeps plotting new wickedness that often involves experimenting on uninfected humans. This fourth chapter of Alice in Zombieland in 3-D opens with our heroine somehow granted super powers by the virus and her army of great-looking clones taking down a company installation. After that delightful salutatory carnage Alice searches for her friends from the previous movie eventually holing up with survivors in a maximum-security prison in the middle of Los Angeles. You know the one. If that plot summary seems quick and dirty so is the film a but really how much detail do you need? If youre interested in this movie its because you love either seeing zombies explode (check) the video games (major character included check) or Jovovich kicking undead butt in every conceivable way (check and mate). The insane plot holes dont really matter nor do the laughable divisions of good and bad a the villain ( Shawn Roberts) clearly went to the Agent Smith School of Diction in one of many ""Matrix"" echoes. Anderson has said that the 3-D technology slowed down his edits giving the eye more time to catch up to the images. As a result the action is easier to read than in most films of the genre and therefore more enjoyable. Anderson makes particular use of sets and locations to wring out more bang for the stereoscopic buck. No it doesnt have the immersive quality of ""Avatar"" but the film does represent a step toward making 3-D par for the course. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNew on DVD The AmericanDecember 26 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTVideo_gamesVideo GamesPlotAfterlifeCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-resident-evil-20100911,0,417454.story",200,residentevilafterlife4,residentevilafterlife,latimes

Though she could be forgiven for stifling yawns as she tackles yet another go-round as one-note heroine Alice in ""Resident Evil Afterlife"" Milla Jovovich remains the lone light in the increasingly lackluster videogame-based zombie franchise which barrels through its fourth installment with a threatened fifth on the way. Though boasting significant technical improvements on 2007s borderline incoherent third installment ""Afterlife"" is equally moribund and perhaps even more shamelessly derivative. Considering the franchises track record and evergreen formula (hot woman kills zombies with sharp objects) pic should rack up healthy earnings over the sparse post-Labor Day weekend. Shot in good-looking (if massively gimmick-laden) 3D and boasting action setpieces in which viewers can actually discern who is fighting whom and where ""Afterlife"" is a far cry from the murky ceiling-wax aesthetics of the series earlier iterations. Yet despite this professional sheen director Paul W.S. Anderson (who also directed the original) can hardly manage a hint of suspense or excitement.And excitement is exactly what the film ought to have in excess as an admirably bonkers opening sequence depicts the superpowered Alice and her army of clones (created for half-remembered reasons in ""Resident Evil Extinction"") as they storm the underground Tokyo HQ of the sinister Umbrella Corp. which four years earlier unleashed a zombie apocalypse. Grenades pistols assault rifles swords and ninja stars are unleashed in a frenzied flurry of shootouts and photogenic freefalls with a helpful digital counter keeping track of the death count as it soars past the 300-mark. Yet this is all a mere prologue to a long stretch of inactivity as Alice is stripped of both her superpowers and her clones and left wandering the earth in search of other survivors. Commandeering a plane to seek out a rumored safe haven in Alaska Alice reconnects with former compatriot Claire (Ali Larter) who has been helpfully stricken with amnesia all the better to facilitate a slow drip of plot points as she recovers her memory. The two then head south to Los Angeles for some reason and crash-land on the roof of a prison where a clutch of survivors are holed up seeking shelter from thousands of zombies assembled below. The zombie hordes once prone to bursting out of every dark corner now seem to alarm the survivors about as much as a bumblebee set loose at a pool party and serve more as distant technical obstacles than as predatory foes. Indeed once past the opening sequence a weird lack of urgency sets in with characters rarely breaking beyond a brisk jog to evade danger and fight scenes stripped of all verve by being uniformly shot in extreme slow-motion. Rounding out the victims list are Boris Kodjoe as a good-looking basketball player Kim Coates as a sleazy Hollywood producer and ""Prison Breaks"" Wentworth Miller daringly cast as a prisoner. Few among the cast are granted enough dialogue to distinguish themselves as they wait to be bloodily dispatched though Coates does well enough in his sleazeball role and Shawn Roberts (as Umbrella Corp. villain Albert Wesker) essentially does a slipshod impression of Hugo Weavings Agent Smith from ""The Matrix"" (one of many areas in which ""Afterlife"" lifts from the Wachowski brothers playbook). Jovovich once again invests her character with more energy and professionalism than the role deserves. Technical contributions are mostly well handled though the ceaseless industrial-rock score quickly becomes tiresome.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Paul W.S. Anderson must have learned something remaking the Roger Corman-produced 1975 cult classic Death Race 2000 as 2008s Death Race. Andersons third go-round in the directors chair as the auteur and scribe of the popular Resident Evil series benefits from a Corman-esque sense of economy In classic B-movie form most of the film takes place on a single set a prison where a motley crew of survivors has taken refuge from a zombie apocalypse accidentally caused by an evil multinational corporation named Umbrella. Corman would also approve of the films embrace of trendy spectacle in the form of 3-D that captures the you-are-there immediacy of videogames putting armchair warriors right in the middle of the frenetic action. Andersons real-life wife Milla Jovovich returns to her star-making role as a genetically altered superwoman who has used her superior fighting skills to wage war on her former employers in the Umbrella corporation. Resident Evil Afterlife sends Jovovich to Alaska in search of an elusive zombie paradise known as Arcadia and then to a prison where she plots an escape to safer territory and teams up with a slick professional basketball player (Boris Kodjoe) a mysterious soldier (Wentworth Miller) and returning series veteran Ali Larter among others. Resident Evils appeal as a series is almost exclusively rooted in Jovovichs charisma. She combines the enigmatic magnetism of a silent-movie siren with the badass bravado of an action hero Imagine Theda Bara as the Woman With No Name. Jovovich carries Afterlife on her slight-yet-sturdy shoulders as it alternates between flashy setpieces that make savvy shameless use of 3-D--the most memorable involves a hulking creature that looks like the product of cross-pollination between the undead and medieval torturers--and quiet scenes of the survivors strategizing over how to stay alive. Afterlife loses some of its trashy propulsive energy in its third act and the climax ""borrows"" liberally from The Matrix. Really the whole series would be unthinkable without the films of George Romero. In that respect Anderson has taken another page from the Corman playbook for his superior B-movie If youre going to steal at least steal well.

Posted September 17 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Resident Evil Afterlife is the fourth Hollywood installment based on the hit zombie video game but even though it picks up where 2007s Extinction left off with dozens of Milla Jovovich clones promising to seek revenge on the nefarious virus-developing Umbrella Corporation its filmmakers have basically just pushed the reset button. Again. Grotesque zombies feast. Jovovichs hero Alice and a small band of the uninfected slay with overwhelming firepower and Matrix-inspired acrobatics and director Paul W.S. Anderson (Alien vs. Predator) wraps the numbing exhausting violence with stylistic effects that became cliche if not parody years ago. Only 3-D makes this installment any different than its predecessors. Resident Evil is a true zombie franchise -- and Im not referring to its actual walking undead. Afterlife is slow-moving but relentless and judging from a post-credits teaser that promises yet another sequel it has an unquenchable appetite for your brain cells.

TWITTER ""Resident Evil Afterlife"" certainly will please its fan base and possibly attract newcomers thanks to its arresting visuals. State-of-the-art 3D effects add a welcome dose of visual freshness to the fourth installment of this video game-based franchise which like its central character has managed to kick butt. Marking the return of director Paul W. S. Anderson to the series ""Resident Evil Afterlife"" certainly will please its fan base and possibly attract newcomers thanks to its arresting visuals. But as with the first three installments those looking for anything more than a series of slam-bang action sequences will find little of interest. The film certainly opens strong with its fearsome heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich in fine form) leading a siege on the evil corporation that years ago set loose a virus that has reduced the world to a postapocalyptic nightmare overrun by flesh-eating zombies. (That the film is set in a burnt-out Los Angeles certainly adds verisimilitude.) The elaborate sequence with Alice brandishing heavy artillery and well-sharpened knives while mowing down endless reserves of hapless opponents is staged in expert mock-video game fashion. Unfortunately things go downhill from there as the plot such as it is kicks in. After a quick sojourn to Alaska and a reunion with her old cohort Claire (Ali Larter) who has amnesia Alice makes her way to L.A. There she joins forces with a ragtag group of survivors trapped in a futuristic high-rise prison with thousands of zombies growling at them from below. Among the group is Claires inmate brother Chris played by Wentworth Miller who after ""Prison Break"" and this seems less in need of an agent than a parole officer. Then theres talk lots of it with the only potential excitement coming when it looks like Alice will strip down for a shower only to be interrupted by a zombie invasion (you could practically hear the disappointed sighs in the theater). Eventually the filmmaker rewards our patience with several more high-octane action sequences featuring enough slo-mo and bullet-time effects to remind us not only of the series video game origins but also unfortunately rather too much of ""The Matrix""; the fact that the perpetually sunglass-wearing villain seems to have stepped right out of those films doesnt help. Among the action highlights -- all accompanied by the relentlessly grinding industrial music score -- are Alice and Claires showdown with a giant zombie wielding what looks to be a giant meat tenderizer and the appearance of a couple of zombie dogs who split their heads into two parts each complete with razor-sharp teeth. Shot in actual 3D rather than being the latest example of the horrible post-shooting conversion process ""Afterlife"" undeniably looks terrific. The filmmakers better hope that those inflated 3D television prices come down in time for the home video release.
