Entertainment Amy Schumer Is More Than Seth Rogen With Boobs In ""Trainwreck"" The first female-led Judd Apatow comedy is a rowdy delight but it does lose some of what makes Schumer Schumer. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Bill Hader and Amy Schumer in Trainwreck. Mary Cybulski / Universal Pictures ID 6299244 Within its shaggy embrace the Judd Apatow comedy empire includes the female friendship saga Bridesmaids the high school story Freaks and Geeks Lena Dunhams Brooklyn bildungsroman Girls and the biopic spoof Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story. But when it comes to the movies Apatow himself has directed there have been two all-consuming themes -- guys who struggle to grow up and the women who domesticate them.First there was Andy (Steve Carell) the title character of The 40-Year-Old Virgin a man who like the action figures he collects is still in mint condition frozen in a sort of extended adolescence until single mom Trish (Catherine Keener) comes along. Then there was Ben (Seth Rogen) the 23-year-old stoner hauled into respectability by the unexpected pregnancy that resulted from his one-night stand with type A Alison (Katherine Heigl).Theres also Funny Peoples famous comedian George (Adam Sandler) a cautionary tale for would-be protege Ira (Rogen again). After rattling around his mansion for years having sex with girls who ""always leave disappointed"" George tries to win back Laura (Leslie Mann) whom he loved but couldnt help cheating on. And by This Is 40 we got Pete (Paul Rudd) a dude whos married with children to Debbie (Mann again) and whos still wrestling with arrested development eating cupcakes out of the trash and putting out doomed records by commercially unviable bands. View this image > Schumer and Hader. Universal Pictures ID 6299254 In Apatows films its women who herd men into adulthood and attempt to keep them there. Its a service for which he seems sincerely appreciative even as the stories hes telling are about how these relationships are pretty much the death of fun. Thats the fundamental contradiction at the heart of Apatows work as hilarious profane tender and annoying as it can be as a whole. His movies venerate monogamy in such a traditional configuration -- the house the kids the manicured backyard -- and yet theyre never as lively and comfortable as when theyre depicting the ways in which guys can be slovenly goofballs letting it all hang out together. Its why This Is 40 the Apatow film that most turned away from male friendships in favor of married life inadvertently made its characters plush Los Angeles existence look like suburban No Exit.Its been tough to conceptualize what a female-led Apatow comedy would look like not just because its hard to imagine a studio movie in which the female equivalent of Seth Rogen romances a male equivalent of Leslie Mann but because its Apatows women whove always had to lead the charge toward a stable home life responsibility and growth.So thank god for Amy Schumer the writer and star of Trainwreck who solves this problem albeit imperfectly.Trainwreck is still very much an Apatow movie about how a pot-smoking foul-mouthed disaster of a main character finds happiness by coupling and cleaning up. But it doesnt feel like a gender-flipped version of a story Apatows already told about a guy who finds himself astonished and grateful to have earned the attentions of some endearing harridan.Trainwreck like Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin before it falls into the bawdy end of the romantic comedy genre but it often feels less like a rom-com and more like the story of a woman who comes to terms with the idea that shes met someone she might actually want to have a relationship with -- and its terrifying. Aaron (Bill Hader) the dorky dreamboat doctor Amy (Schumer) meets when assigned to write a story about his work with professional sports teams is on board pretty much from the start. One of the movies most heart-melting moments comes early on and in defiance of usual rom-com contortions when Aaron tells Amy straightforwardly that he really likes her and thinks they should date. The transformation is entirely hers. View this image > Schumer and John Cena. Mary Cybulski / Universal Pictures ID 6299266 Amy is her own kind of hot mess injecting a jolt of chaos into Apatows world in which women are inevitably the grown-ups. Shes already an adult one with a nice New York apartment a high-flying job as a writer at a pitch-perfect fictional mens mag called SNuff and a muscly sorta boyfriend (John Cena in one of the movies several delightful comedic performances from unexpected parties) who doesnt know they arent exclusive. And Amy likes to have sex as we see from an introductory scene in which she maneuvers her way into receiving some oral sex reaches orgasm and pretends to fall asleep so she doesnt have to return the favor.Amy has what one might call sex like a man except that its not the kind of sex that Apatows male protagonists generally get to have. They tend to be the opposite of ladies men awkward or virginal or getting turned down by their wives because their wives are constipated. They tend to be like Aaron who admits to having slept with three women in his life as opposed to Amy who struggles to come up with a number for the past year. Apatow is one of the kings of the R-rated comedy but theres a conservatism to his treatment of sex and relationships thats tied up in his empathy for late blooming nice guys. And its one that Schumers subversive sensibilities nicely counter.When Amy crawls out of a strangers bed and realizes to her dismay that its a bed in Staten Island her ferry ride of shame is actually a scene of bedraggled joyousness arms flung open king-of-the-world style (or queen). The title of the movie suggests its heroine is in need of repair but the early sequences of her tottering home in high heels and sneaking outside during a date to get high defy condemnation. Its not Amys fecklessness thats the problem its what happens when shes no longer having fun when she meets someone she really likes and the boozy random hookups no longer feel like freedom.In the flashback that starts the movie young Amy is told by the philandering father (Colin Quinn) she adores that the reason her parents marriage failed is because ""monogamy isnt realistic"" a lesson she internalizes after chanting it at his request. But adult Amy with her cherubic face and physical fearlessness is having too much unfeigned fun for that to come across as the kind of hangup its meant to. When someone tells her shes ""mean"" we shrug it off as easily as she does -- its not mean to not surrender to other peoples expectations.Still theres nothing in Trainwreck thats as daring as Schumers sketch comedy series which prioritizes boundary pushing in a way that the movie doesnt. It only wants a happy ending and wide-eyed Aaron -- who looks out of his depth from the moment Amy calmly takes him home sits him on the couch and initiates sex -- turns out to be too genuinely nice of a guy to unsettle Amy in anything but good ways (particularly thanks to the advice of his friend LeBron James who plays himself and gives another of the movies surprisingly wonderful comedic turns). View this image > Schumer. Mary Cybulski / Universal Pictures ID 6299269 Trainwrecks most raw moments deal not in shock but in emotional ugliness -- in the all-too-resonant ways that Amy as she starts to feel more vulnerable picks fights with the people who love her including both Aaron and her younger married pregnant sister Kim (Brie Larson). The movie provides a showcase for Schumers dramatic side which is as impressive as her sense of humor even if her characters eventual confession that she doesnt understand why Aaron would want to be with someone like her is Trainwrecks most disappointing moment. Its one in which she and the schlubby menchildren who precede her in Apatows movies suddenly have something unwanted in common -- they all see themselves as having managed to date up.But the last thing we want from Schumer is a crisis of confidence or to have her put in a position in which she has to be gratified to finally have a good guy in her life. Amy is gloriously fallible but she doesnt need to be fixed -- or rather whatever changes she makes should come at her own volition. Trainwreck wobbles a bit in guiding its heroine toward her happily ever after and in trying to figure out a way to have her move forward without condemning the person she was. It does eventually make its way there with the help of a bitingly funny scene of utter humiliation that emphasizes its not the random sex and drinking that are the problem so much as the oblivion Amys now using them to seek out.It works because Amys the kind of character who can bounce back from sexual mishaps far easier than emotional ones -- its rock bottom rather than punishment. Trainwreck is a rewarding imperfect struggle between two comedic sensibilities but its helped by the way that Aaron unlike the Apatow women doesnt seem like a scold. Amy gets her man or maybe he gets her because the characters journey is about getting herself to a place where she wants and is able to commit to him without it feeling like a compromise. Its not a surrender -- its a triumph.

Now shes the best thing to happen to Hollywood since the Tina Fey/Amy Poehler double act. Schumers new autobiographical comedy Trainwreck about a commitment-phobic NYC writer is the funniest film of the summer--outrageous and out to make you think. The posters say ""from the guy who brought you Bridesmaids"" (meaning superproducer Judd Apatow) but Trainwreck is more of a straightforward rom-com with one big difference Schumer plays the traditional ""man"" role. Shes hard-partying promiscuous Amy a writer for a Maxim-esque rag that publishes articles like ""How to talk your girlfriend into a three-way."" But when assigned to interview a sports surgeon (Bill Hader adorable) Amy cracks and gets serious. Trainwreck isnt perfect. An emotionally weak ending feels like a cop-out. But you can forgive this film a lot. You forget how limited so many movies ideas of women are until Schumer launches into an extended tampon joke. Its a film about everyday sexism and double standards. Schumer is calling this stuff out but you only realize this when you stop laughing. Wince-inducing in many ways Trainwreck has its priorities right.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Jul 17 2015 Culture Theres an early gag in Trainwreck the new comedy written by and starring Amy Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow in which our protagonist also named Amy stumbles home with a new male conquest and watches him disrobe. When the fellow drops trou she is both astonished and appalled at the extent of his manhood. ""Your dick doesnt end"" she exclaims.Related Story Amy Schumer and the Growing Pains of Comedy I wasnt sure when I saw the film (and Im still not) whether this was a cunning bit of self-mockery Apatows raunchy comedies have consistently been chided for their excessive length and Trainwreck which clocks in at just over two hours is no exception. This is a movie from which 15 or 20 minutes could have been profitably trimmed.Which is to say that my harshest critique of Trainwreck is that it offers too much of a good thing. This exquisitely rude rom-com is the most flat-out hilarious film to hit screens in many moons a big-screen breakout for Schumer and a return to form for Apatow after the disappointment of This is 40. (I was and remain a committed defender of the oft-maligned Funny People.)Following a prologue in which Amys father (Colin Quinn) explains to his young daughters the impossibility of monogamy by way of a childs doll (""What if I told you this was the only doll you could ever play with for the rest of your life?"") we flash ahead 23 years to find the grownup Amy taking her dads advice to heart. Her encounter with the over-endowed paramour is merely one of a series of interchangeable one-nighters. Groggily waking up in one strange bed she prays ""Please dont be a dorm room please dont be a dorm room"" only to discover a reality almost as horrific Staten Island. (Her shame-ride back to Manhattan however proves admirably shame-free as she Titanic-poses on the guardrails of the Staten Island Ferry.) Amy does have one regular fella the walking HGH-supplement Steven (a surprisingly funny turn by WWE star John Cena). But following her sublimely unsuccessful effort to coach him to talk dirty its all downhill for that relationship.This exquisitely rude rom-com is the most flat-out hilarious film to hit screens in many moons.Amy works for a glossy magazine memorably titled SNuff which under the leadership of its editor Dianna (a gloriously wicked and glammed-up Tilda Swinton) specializes in articles such as ""The SNuff Guide to Beating Off at Work"" and ""Ugliest Celebrity Kids Under Six."" But when Amy is sent out to write a feature on a charmingly nerdy borderline-virginal sports doctor Aaron (Bill Hader) she discovers to her great surprise that she rather likes him.The narrative that unfolds from this premise is not a novel one but Schumers caustic wit keeps the story on its toes. Even as we watch Amy and Aaron begin to fall for each other gauzily Amy punctures the moment in voiceover declaring ""I hope this love montage ends like Jonestown."" Several scenes (the magazine story pitch meeting the bridal shower) are reminiscent of Schumers TV series and the overall tone while less political is no less biting. There are sharp comic drive-bys of Willy Wonka Keyser Soze Kanye West and Lifetime movies as well as what is almost certainly the best Alex Rodriguez joke of all time.Schumer herself is a magnificent mess as Amy and Haders quirky likability has never been put to better use. And even beyond Swinton and Cena the supporting cast is uniformly terrific Quinn as Amys belligerent dad; Brie Larson as her settled-down younger sister; Vanessa Bayer as her co-worker and best friend; Dave Attell as the acerbic homeless guy who claims a chunk of sidewalk outside her apartment.But perhaps the movies greatest surprise is the comic chops displayed by NBA god LeBron James who plays a version of himself as Aarons patient and off-work buddy. (This may be the cleverest counter-self-portrait since Michael Ceras coke-addled sex fiend in This is the End.) Schumer and Apatow deftly avoid saddling James with more than he can handle and he nails the material hes given--most of it revolving around his super-sized love for the city of Cleveland his exceptional frugality and his profound concern for Aarons romantic prospects.The movie drags a touch in its final third (an ""intervention"" scene plays as exactly what it is an unnecessary excuse for additional celebrity cameos) before coasting into a decidedly Apatowian happy ending. The director has always deployed dirty jokes in the service of conventional values--monogamy parenthood marital perseverance--and a number of critics have already faulted the film for its lack of cultural daring in this respect. (I confess that Im not entirely convinced this is a bad thing.) Is Trainwreck essentially a gender-inverted variation on Knocked Up? Sure it is. But that in itself represents progress.In any case this is a film that belongs not to its director but to its star who if there is any justice in the world is about to ascend from cult icon to mass phenomenon. Schumer will almost certainly have many opportunities to deploy her edgy wit toward edgier ends. I can hardly wait.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Sanderson on how men and women experience marital satisfaction differently Whenever Im walking around D.C. with friends on sunny Saturday afternoons we inevitably see lots of babies adorable fat charmingly bald babies. Its not uncommon to hear sighs of ""oh my gosh hes so precious"" and ""I want one"" from my companions; I too have been accused of being a baby stalker from time to time. But at The Atlantics One Day University event on Saturday Amherst psychology professor Catherine A. Sanderson made a convincing case that cute kids (and cute husbands and wives) might seem different when theyre yours to keep. She gave a witty lecture on what social science can tell us about happiness and these were my three biggest take-aways First I will no longer have to worry about being awesome if I get married because my husband will probably be happier for having taken vows regardless of how great I am. In studies of marital satisfaction over time Sanderson said ""there is in fact a positive correlation for some people. Guess who those people are? Men. For men yeah being married makes you happier and the good news is it doesnt matter at all who youre married to. It could be like a mail-order bride from Russia--does not matter at all.""

"Chastened Amy Trainwreck Fails Its Breakout Star; Also the Pleasantly Surprising Ant-Man << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Chastened Amy Trainwreck Fails Its Breakout Star; Also the Pleasantly Surprising Ant-Man Universal Pictures Movies July 17 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Amy Schumer seems like a milkmaid in a Mel Brooks movie or on Benny Hill. So whenever she goes to churn butter shell always do it as though shes actually making something else. But her comedy is beyond simulation. It deals with the thing being simulated blowjobs anal sex and all the rest. The title of her Comedy Central show gets right to the point Inside Amy Schumer. On it shes the funniest neurotic in America. The neurosis hails from no pure comedy tradition. All the worry is happy or drunken; the insecurities are so ingrained that they register in reverse as narcissism. Over three seasons the show has tightened and thought its way to brilliance. It goes after the social double standards of sex and gender at work in relationships and in the culture and it satirizes the damage men and women do to each other and to themselves. Even when a sketch is as obvious as one from the end of Season 2 in which Schumer spends a day obsessively grooming herself for a date while being bombarded with enticements for further weirder grooming its funny because the idea takes the express train to lunacy with her looking hot but cowering in terror under her bed. The show works because we know where Schumers coming from. Now shes the star of Trainwreck a Judd Apatow-directed romantic comedy she wrote and I have no idea where its coming from. The title seems like a designation more for the film than for the promiscuous partier Schumer plays. Its got no rhythm or reliable comfort zone. The jokes and ensemble scenes are all rushed so you cant savor them or what anyone in them is doing. Schumers character Amy Townsend writes for SNuff a Manhattan-based lad mag overseen by Dianna a skinny spray-tanned Tilda Swinton snidely answering the unasked question What if Toni Collette were made of dried apricots? The first staff meeting comes early in the film and you know youre in trouble because no one seems to know what the joke is. Diannas hunt for story pitches (the staff includes Schumer Vanessa Bayer Randall Park and Jon Glaser) also feels like a hunt for gags. (""You Call Those Tits?"" is one potential feature.) Swinton bites down on the part but the sequence is full of reaction shots so you can never quite take in the joke her face and body language are telling. This is to say that Apatow is looking for comedy in the wrong spots. Or maybe he was saving Swinton from herself. Either way its a flat scene but its not the only one. Amy leaves the meeting with an assignment Shell profile Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) knee surgeon to the stars. His clientele consists mostly of sports legends shes never heard of. As she enters Aarons office LeBron James is exiting and she doesnt know who he is. Maybe this is supposed to make her story better because either her ignorance will be upended or her skepticism could unearth some journalistic surprise but the whole thing is just a setup for an unethical unconvincing romance. You keep looking for Aaron to notice some sparkle in Amy that allows him to proceed. But its just the script obeying a diagram. As a character Amys a mess -- not in the way ""train wreck"" would imply just as a conception. Shes narcissistic caustic tantrum-prone rarely sober and situationally ignorant -- and not only about sports (she thinks its ""Doctors With Borders""). Loosely shes a bigot too. When Aaron asks her to produce a photo of a black friend she sheepishly shows him one of herself a friend and their waiter. Schumers mix of delusional certitude and chagrin is actually funny. But after enough of these scenes youre asking yourself who is this woman and what is it Schumer is trying to say with her? If the character doesnt work then neither can the movie. Its got a good opening scene thats set during Amys girlhood in which she and her sister listen as their father (Colin Quinn) explains why their mother is kicking him out of the house. He compares marriage to being stuck for life with the same doll and implores them to repeat ""Monogamy isnt realistic."" Theres a cut forward 23 years when Amy is drunkenly bedding impossibly endowed strangers; discovering in horror that she has awakened in Staten Island; and taking mincing high-heeled steps along a walk of shame that culminates in a humiliated/triumphal stretch on the deck of the Staten Island ferry. She does all of this while holding down a he-man boyfriend named Steven (John Cena) who wants more from Amy than she knows how to give. Cena isnt bad in his handful of scenes. But even the small parts suffer from being overconceived and underwritten. Steven wants monogamy with Amy but he also seems gay. And the movie doesnt see any of those possibilities through either. In bed one night Amy asks Steven to talk during sex and the best he can do is stuff like ""Im gonna fill you with my protein."" Is he actually closeted gay for himself or just lousy in bed? The gay boyfriend is a relatable worry in Schumers comedy that rarely ends in belly laughs but always provides some insight into her paranoid distrust. In popular culture men dreaming of having a gay girlfriend is a cliche. In Schumers world (and frankly beyond it) having a gay boyfriend is something women dread and the depiction of that dread is rare in mainstream culture. But the movie shares Amys preemptive promiscuity. Its always on to the next thing to keep from dealing with the matter at hand. That opening scene with Quinn and the little daughters turns sour once you realize an hour later that he wasnt delivering a thesis. He was riffing. There is something psychological under the surface of this movie something about sex and a fear of monogamy but the movie isnt exploring that. It just stays busy. Amy and her sister Kim (Brie Larson) make numerous nursing-home visits to see Quinn as he spews something crude or racist or insulting. (The movie has literalized his on-set curmudgeon routine.) Amy insults Kims bland doughy husband (Mike Birbiglia) and is freaked out by his precocious son (Evan Brinkman). (Theres a very funny moment at one of Manhattans Alice in Wonderland theme cafes when Amy gets a load of her brother-in-law and the kid beaming at each other and says ""Theyre like on a speed date."") Because things are so thin on Amys end the movie tries to give Aaron some of the action but it just confuses everything more. His scenes without Amy are excuses to showcase access to LeBron James who along with Cena feels more substantial than anyone here but who even as himself has nothing to do but butler and chauffeur Amy and Aarons relationship into existence. The filmmakers dont appear to think much of him. He gets to go one-on-one with Hader on a basketball court and earnestly recite the lyrics to ""Gold Digger."" (Method Man has a more embarrassingly thankless part as Quinns Caribbean orderly.) Hader doesnt play Aaron as LeBrons friend per se but as a tolerant acquaintance of Jamess cute confidence. Hader might be the best natural actor of all of the longtime Saturday Night Live cast members and you can feel him building a character here. But I didnt leave Trainwreck with a sense of who that character is. Instead of reducing Amys obnoxiousness it punches his up like in a restaurant scene in which he asks for the check by shouting for it. I laughed because Im helpless against an antic Hader but its a nonsensical quirk for this guy to have. The entire film proceeds from that kind of nonsense. At some point LeBron stages a love intervention on Aarons behalf. James sits alongside Chris Evert and Matthew Broderick while Marv Albert does play-by-play and its impossible to overstate the degree to which this sequence isnt funny. Its like watching five people die in a fire except the culprit is limp comedy instead of arson. Evert looks mortified before she has even said her one vulgar line. It seems as if theyve all been force-fed their dialogue and only some of them know its poison. In a scene like this you dont know where Schumers reality-check comedy ends and Apatows adolescent fantasies begin. Apatow just put out a collection of interviews with comedians that hes been conducting since he was a kid. Its called Sick in the Head and its a fun enlightened book whose insights come from conversations guided by Apatows wonder and respect and awe but also from his genuine human curiosity -- all of which were on display in The 40-Year-Old Virgin but gradually have been seeping out. Its been replaced by stubbornness and incuriosity. Now theres a banal certitude to his movies. This is how the world works -- like how the movies say it does. Apatow has been surpassed by his friend Paul Feig a writer and director of film comedies1 who doesnt have to hunt for a joke. He has the assurance and preparation to build a scene -- and often a single shot -- around a guaranteed laugh. In the book Apatow confesses to having wanted to work with Schumer since he heard her on Howard Sterns radio show. Her sense of freshness drew him to her. It made him want to direct her. With Trainwreck Im not sure he has. The wildness he perceived and the sense of not giving a fuck really works on her television show. Thats the kind of feminism that powers it -- the self-conscious performance of unself-consciousness of exploring what it means for women to behave socially like men. Where then are the lines of propriety and who defines where those lines go? The sketches are brief barbed and all point to a big idea about women sexuality and personality. A particular sketch can be a mess but by the third season the ideas unify and they sting. Most of Trainwreck is sketchy too but in the manner of a random mistaken assembly of an outtake reel. Throughout we get glimpses of a lame black-and-white romantic comedy that stars Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei and its there to remind you that things could always have been worse. The film feels like something that Schumer might have written or wanted to write years ago when she was still searching for a persona. But the thing is Schumer doesnt have one. She has many and the virtue of a sketch show is that you can discard them once theyve served a purpose. But she and Apatow dont appear to be interested in sustaining an actual woman in an actual romantic comedy and if youre Parker Posey or even Drew Barrymore that kind of daffy caricature can get you through a 90- or 100-minute movie. This one lasts for more than two hours and never once is there a moment in which Schumer makes a case for stardom the way she does on her show. She could be a new improved Bette Midler. You get the sense that shes trying to reintroduce the psychological wackiness that Midler eventually forsook in order to do heavenward schmaltz. Its not just sexism and self-hate that Schumer wants to bring down its cute half-assed romantic fantasies. But Trainwreck turns out to be too much of that kind of fantasy. The milkmaid isnt that filthy after all. She actually is just making butter.  Marvel Entertainment Sometimes you get to a movie ready to walk right out. Theres an air of inevitability thats a turnoff. It doesnt even need an audience to be a hit. It could pay to watch itself. Some superhero movies and film series are that way. But not Ant-Man. This is the sort of movie where you see the effort and say Thank god. Its good sloshy fun with the exact right proportions. The hero (Paul Rudd) has a personality. The villain (Corey Stoll) is loathsome without being over-the-top about it. The supporting black and Latino characters are stereotypes but played by energetic charismatic actors (T.I. and Michael Pena). And theres a bite-size perfectly basic caper plot and effects and art design that feel sprung from dreams. Some of my initial resistance to Ant-Man had to do with the movies troubled provenance. Its a Marvel title that Peyton Reed stepped in to direct after the departure of Edgar Wright who keeps a writing credit. When a solid but nondescript director replaces a stylish one you fear blandness. But this movie has a real personality. Rudd plays Scott Lang a professional thief in San Francisco who winds up helping old affluent scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) prevent his protege Darren Cross (Stoll) from doing terrible things with a special suit that allows the wearer to shrink down to a bug-size super-soldier. Pym has a suit of his own which he gives to Lang. With the help of Pyms envious daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly who in a pageboy doesnt look a day over Barbara Hershey) Pym trains Lang to break into his lab which Cross controls and dismantle the new suit. And that is mercifully that. But a lot happens often with ingenuity. Pena plays an ex-con and Langs roommate and he gets a couple of terrific ""my cousin told me"" montages to narrate in which different Latino characters make gossipy plot advancements while lip-syncing to Penas voice. Its like a memory of a music video. What big superhero movie would have either the patience or awareness of a world outside its own for witty sequences like those? You see the backyard parties and the swagger everybodys got and its as if somebodys thrown open a window. It works so well that you even table for another day the problem of Marvels ongoing marginalization of non-white characters. Once Ant-Man harnesses the suit he winds up at a surprise location where Anthony Mackie as Falcon appears in what is basically a security guard job. Nonetheless life around a movie is still life. Or at least thats what I told myself this time. Rudd has at last reeled himself back from the embitterment and smugness hed taken on since he started working with Judd Apatow. He seems youthful and trim and happy to be here. So does Douglas who gets to do more than be old and wise. His comic version of disgust is a new look. These were never crucial Marvel characters but the movies update of the mythology and simultaneous tribute to the history the company has built count as acts of love.2 Theres a plot about Lang trying to get back into the good graces of his young daughter thats pretty hoary. But it lets Bobby Cannavale and Judy Greer -- far more him than her -- in on some of the fun and leads the movies finale which involves action sequences set amid the daughters toys. Some of the kick comes from the pleasure the filmmakers have with size and perception and physics turning running bathwater into a tsunami and ants into Godzillas. The timing on Dan Lebental and Colby Parker Jr.s editing from Langs shrunken perspective to ours results in some of the years best visual comedy. And the 3-D is the best most committed use of the format since the last Jackass movie. Who knows what Wrights artistry would have made of this? But Reed and his crew do just fine. Its annoying to think that the Marvel tractor beam is just going to suck up all of these good well-delineated characters. Still here in this little speck of the Disney galaxy where cleverness and feeling are prized over bigness and brand continuity its not Marvels universe that Ant-Man seems sprung from. Its Pixars. Like Bridesmaids The Heat and Spy.Both Marvel and Grantland are owned by Disney. Filed Under Movies Trainwreck amy schumer ant-man Paul Rudd michael pena T.I.

Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures Amy Schumer and Bill Hader in Trainwreck. Mary Cybulski/Universal Pictures To be a lead in a Hollywood romance -- especially a female lead -- is to be told whats wrong with you. A lot. Theres always an assistant or a best friend or of course the guy himself to fix you or coach you because you are broken. The fact that Amy Schumers character in Trainwreck -- also named Amy -- is the reason its called Trainwreck would make you think shes in for similar treatment. But thats not as much the case as it might seem. Amy starts as a boozy single magazine writer for whom sex is pretty low-stakes but sleeping over is too intimate. She gets her outlook from her dad played by Colin Quinn who drummed it into Amy and her sister at an early age that partnering up is for suckers. But while she is sort of a mess in some ways shes not lonely or waiting around or disappointed and hurt. Shes got other things on her mind -- like working and caring for her dad whos now in assisted living. When shes sent to profile a surgeon played by Bill Hader who treats pro athletes the stakes do start off low. It gets tricky when they run into the one factor that so many romantic comedies put off until the very last minute They like each other. Thats pretty much his pitch after she says they shouldnt mix romance and work. ""Do you like me?"" he asks. ""Yeah"" she answers. ""Yeah see I really like you."" Consider how weird it is that Hollywood romantic comedies so often position love as something that happens to people who dont like each other. This winds up being Trainwrecks most unexpectedly audacious idea. For adults its the ones you like that get complicated not the ones you fight with for an hour and a half and then kiss in the rain. That exchange -- and those words ""I really like you"" -- become the involving part of this story and the sexy part too. Both Schumer and Hader have the potential for such outsized silliness that when their performances are still and straightforward it feels like it matters. Its still a comedy and its really funny. Maybe the nicest surprise is that the supportive sidekick isnt her best friend but the sports doctors confidante LeBron James. Played very convincingly by the way by LeBron James who offers advice about love but also about his hometown. This isnt really a cameo; its a bona fide supporting performance in a comedy and hes straight-up terrific. Make no mistake Trainwreck which Schumer wrote and Judd Apatow directed has some very traditional romantic comedy elements including a big implausible finish. But even if you know where youre going to wind up it takes interesting side trips along the way.

""Trainwreck"" her lengthy and labored rom-com with benevolent comedy emperor and self-appointed Cosby prosecutor Judd Apatow - she wrote it and plays the lead Apatow directed it - displays both the immense potential and the current limits of Schumers comic genius. Right now she is still the minidress-wearing minibar-raiding female version of Tom Riddle before he became Lord Voldemort not quite aware of the extent of her powers. In English my movie review is as follows ""Trainwreck"" is not very good but Schumer is frequently amazing in it. Officially her fans will not be disappointed; not far below the surface its a bummer.As Schumer herself has put it she ""goes in and out of playing the irreverent idiot"" a complicated dance that presents a constant challenge to gender stereotypes and constantly cuts the ground out from beneath haters and detractors. People are at liberty to think shes not funny of course or to suggest that any particular Schumer assault on the great shibboleths of race and sex and gender is poorly calibrated. But they are always in grave danger of being rendered utterly foolish by the deep Socratic game of Schumers blond bland slutty persona by her shrewd performance of cluelessness. As she has demonstrated on ""The Bachelorette"" an egregious television program that she has almost entirely subverted or at least has provided with a raison detre it never possessed in the first place the calculated blankness of Schumerism is like gender-war stealth technology designed to penetrate the Soviet-style inefficiencies of the male radar system.Fame is still different for women and comedy is still different for women as the great ""Can girls be funny?"" debate of 2014 reminded us. Amid this decades explosion of female-centric and/or feminist comedy Schumer has taken on a cultural importance she didnt necessarily want or expect and which she has achieved at least partly by being in the right spot at the right time. But she has also worked it like nobodys business. As Emily Nussbaum of the New Yorker observed about Schumers rapid rise ""when youre put on a pedestal the whole world gets to upskirt you."" Schumer has short-circuited that process by upskirting herself so to speak - by appearing to reveal too much while revealing only how much she remains in control. She delivered a window-rattling manifesto to the Ms. Foundation last year (""I say if Im beautiful. I say if Im strong"") and she covers the August issue of GQ clad in the bikini worn by Princess Leia as Jabba the Hutts sex slave. Those are not contradictions but interrelated and integral elements of the same package.""Trainwreck"" has clearly consumed a lot of money and time and ingenuity. Its a personal passion project for Schumer on one level and also her big coming-out party held at the apex of the pop-culture volcano. As compromised and undermined as the Hollywood movie is by the rise of TV and the victory of the robots it still confers a mysterious anointment of prestige not to mention large piles of money. There are things in ""Trainwreck"" that are startling and brilliant but they mostly dont have much to do with Schumer herself or what screenwriting manuals would call the arc of her character a New York magazine writer (also named Amy) unhappily devoted to a life of one-night stands and binge drinking. (There is an almost uncanny resemblance between the Amy character and the persona described by my Salon colleague Sarah Hepola in her remarkable memoir ""Blackout."")A lot of that Amy material is funny enough and delivered with Schumers practiced blend of cynicism and vulnerability but also pretty conventional as when she wakes up in some guys bed (having violated the ""sleepover rule"") and prays aloud ""Dear God dont let it be a dorm room."" Its arguably worse than that - shes on Staten Island Goofier and more tangential aspects of ""Trainwreck"" are more original including NBA superstar LeBron James unlikely role as the endlessly supportive and concerned best friend to Amys leading man a sports surgeon named Aaron Connors and played by Bill Hader. James essentially spoofs the yenta-like ""less attractive friend"" found in dozens of rom-coms and does so with immense charisma and good cheer. LeBron is not going to watch the new ""Downton Abbey"" a day late thank you very much (everyone in the Cavs locker room will be talking about it) and hes kind of worried that wild-living Amy will break his buddys fragile heart and trample the fragments underfoot. You Might Also Like James character is the most triumphant result of a subtle politics of gender subversion that runs through the script of ""Trainwreck"" as through all of Schumers work but is not entirely successful. Schumer has never been shy about attacking societal sexism and privileged female smugness in the same breath and the movies Amy is a dim manipulative and deeply wounded person who constantly deceives her so-called boyfriend a bodybuilder (played with zeal by wrestler-turned-actor John Cena) whose true erotic appetites do not seem to encompass Amy or anyone else of her gender. Theres an amusing montage of all the men Amy brings home and then banishes in the wee hours their dreams of enduring romance dashed. One announces ""I guess I really do like pussy""Even casting Hader a lean and angular performer whom no one would accuse of exuding intense masculinity in the obligatory role of Amys true-love savior probably qualifies as a twist. Unfortunately its a twist that falls into the category of ""must have seemed like a great idea at the time."" Hader is a terrific actor (see him with Kristen Wiig in ""The Skeleton Twins"" if you havent) who never finds anything remotely specific or interesting about Aaron and the erotic chemistry between him and Schumer is pretty much at zero degrees Kelvin. Honestly Haders scenes with James are funnier crisper and more alive with possibility than any aspect of Aarons predictable up-and-down love affair with Amy. For that matter Schumer is constantly upstaged by the delirious performance of Tilda Swinton as a nightmarish Anna Wintour-on-steroids magazine editor who greenlights a guide to masturbating at work and a story titled ""Youre Not Gay - Shes Boring"" Actually youd think people would have figured that out If you want to be the star of your own movie you dont put Tilda Swinton in it not even as a wish-granting gnome in a two-second cameo. In a sense that testifies to what Apatow and Schumer have made here which is (oh zing) a bit of a train wreck sprawling and generous and much too long. (How many movies has Apatow sabotaged by pushing them to the length of 19th-century operas with overstuffed plots to match?) ""Trainwreck"" provides ample evidence of Schumers comic genius and also suggests that maybe shes not much of a movie actor right now (or a screenwriter) and that she functions best in small controlled doses.Toward the end of the movie we see Schumer trying her best to do a dance routine alongside the New York Knicks cheerleaders (whom her character has previously derided) and theres so much fearlessness and vulnerability in that brief number so much abashed sexuality and proud sexuality and willingness to make a fool of herself in pursuit of a higher freedom. It makes you laugh and breaks your heart and inspires you to take chances; in a moment of pure physicality free from all the nervous talk it redeems and embraces all the possibilities this disappointing cautious retread rom-com hints at and then avoids.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 17 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 17 2015 702AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Judd Apatow Written by Amy Schumer Starring Amy Schumer Bill Hader Classification 18A Country USA Language English Apart from being laugh-out-loud funny a sure-fire test of the success of a comedy Trainwreck leaves a few things to be desired - including the false advertising of the title.The movie directed by Judd Apatow and written by and starring Amy Schumer stays on the familiar rom-com rails throughout if it takes a few raunchy detours. Schumer plays a Manhattan journalist for a mens magazine called SNuff who parties a lot sleeps with a string of hot guys and tells us about it in a wry dry voice-over. Shes not as querulous as Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City or as concerned with body issues as Bridget Jones. In some circles this might be called Living the Dream. At the world premiere of her new movie Trainwreck actress Amy Schumer calls director Judd Apatow her fairy godfather while Apatow praises the comedienne for being a great storyteller. (July 15) AP Video Video Video Amy Schumer thanks her fairy Godfather at premiere of new movie Comedian Amy Schumer talks about her new film ""Trainwreck"" and the sexual double standards for male and female comics. (April 29) AP Video Video Video Why Amy Schumer insists Trainwreck is not biographical Amys flaw is that she is romantically blocked traumatized by a philandering dad (Colin Quinn) who on the verge of divorce from their mom explained to his two preteen daughters ""Monogamy isnt realistic"" which he compares to the girls need for the freedom to play with various dolls. In the process he somehow thwarts his older daughters chance at future happiness until after a period of growth it all ends in cheers and kisses.For followers of Schumers sacred-cow-slaying TV sketch-comedy series Inside Amy Schumer this will be tough to swallow Its like hearing that Jon Stewart has a secret admiration for Donald Trump or Michael Moore thinks General Motors is an ethical investment. Skewering romantic fantasies and delicate pieties is kind of Schumers thing. When did she turn into such a ... kitten?Whether you look at Trainwreck as Schumer selling out or buying in it feels like a compromise. More specifically the compromise feels guided by Apatow who is in something of a return to broadly popular form after such quasi-autobiographical films as This Is 40 and Funny People. Trainwreck is consistent with his shaggily constructed raunchy-but-cute dramatic comedies that strive hard to be all things to all people and it should probably be a smash.After establishing Amys job world an idiotic Maxim-style publication and her use em and lose em attitude toward men we get to the personal stuff. Along with her younger happily married sister Kim (Brie Larson) Amy is struggling to put her grumpy father who now has advanced multiple sclerosis into an expensive care facility. She could get a promotion by writing a take down on Aaron Connors (Bill Hader) a star sports-medicine doctor with a roster of elite athletes including NBA stars LeBron James and Amare Stoudemire. As is her habit Amy soon seduces the doctor (a shy type who hasnt had sex in six years) and for the rest of the films running time they find reasons why they cant be together before they inevitably are.The change is the gender-role switch. After their first night the commitment-phobic Amy wonders why she has these uncomfortable new things called ""emotions."" The instantly love-struck Aaron gets support from his sensitive big friend (LeBron James as a Downton Abbey-loving romantic).As the straight man and occasional punching bag Hader plays a slightly goofy saint who not only mends multimillion-dollar athletes but gets awards from Doctors Without Borders. And while we might occasionally be puzzled why he finds this hypercritical lush so appealing his character is so impossibly nice that he compels her to see the issue is hers ""Whats wrong with you that you would want to go out with me?"" she asks.Within that frame theres a smorgasbord of small character turns that are delights. The staff at SNuff are led by Tilda Swinton as an Anna Wintour-ish boss with a short temper and shorter attention span urging her staff to ""pitch her hard"" with stories such as ""Youre not gay - shes boring."" Swinton wears so much bronze makeup that to steal a line from novelist Lorrie Moore ""she looks like an oxidization experiment.""Theres a great bit of physical comedy too when James and Hader play a game of one on one - though given the height difference it feels more like three on one. A scene where Schumer watches knee surgery works on a slow build as the operation-room observation window is suddenly decorated with a splat of pea-green puke.The Apatow instinct for doing variations on the same scene hasnt abated though. A series of jokes about Amys muscle-bound boy toy (John Cena) and his poorly repressed homosexual urges for instance is more annoying than funny. And one sequence that could be scratched altogether is an ""intervention"" involving various sports celebrities including sportscaster Marv Albert tennis great Chris Evert and inexplicably actor Matthew Broderick.Theres a funny movie in Trainwreck but you may have to sift through a lot of debris to find it.

Photo Credit Universal Studios / Mary Cybulski advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A nonmonogamous woman begins to fall for a nice guy. Rated R (strong sexual content nudity language and some drug use). BOTTOM LINE Writer-star Schumer plus director Judd Apatow should equal comedic fireworks but this rom-com pops only occasionally. CAST Amy Schumer Bill Hader Colin Quinn LENGTH 202 The subject of gender has become red meat for Rockville Centre-raised Amy Schumer whose Comedy Central show ""Inside Amy Schumer"" has savagely skewered workplace sexism hip-hop misogyny and sexting rituals. Her skits arent just outrageous theyre also outraged mostly by the double standards and hypocrisy of a male-dominated world. Any comedian who can tackle footballs rape problem as Schumer did with a ""Friday Night Lights"" spoof earlier this year should have a field day with the hidebound Hollywood genre known as the romantic comedy. Schumers ""Trainwreck"" doesnt flip the rom-com on its head but merely gives it an awkward shove. Schumer wrote the script and also stars as Amy Townsend a bed-hopping journalist who falls for her latest profile subject a kindly sports doctor named Aaron Conners (Bill Hader). That premise strikes a blow for equal rights For once a woman gets to play the slovenly screw-up and a man plays the perfect saint. In most other respects however ""Trainwreck"" sticks closely to the rom-com tradition. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? For starters its a slapdash affair with too many characters extraneous scenes and jokes that miss as often as they hit -- all hallmarks of this movies director Syosset-raised Judd Apatow. The opening act is the funniest a portrait of Amy as an overgrown party girl who takes after her womanizing father (an endearing Colin Quinn) and scoffs at her happily-married sister (Brie Larson). Amy is dating a doting meathead Steve (John Cena showing solid comedic timing along with his physique) who has no idea that she kicks a new conquest out of bed each morning. Amy works at a lowbrow mens magazine whose abusive editor is played by a marvelous Tilda Swinton. The film weakens once we meet Aaron. This is the kind of non-role that women have been playing for years -- the uninteresting love interest -- so perhaps turnabout is fair play. With few opportunities to crack wise or cut loose however Hader generates zero chemistry with Schumer. Aaron serves mostly as an excuse for Apatow to give small roles to sports figures like LeBron James and Amare Stoudemire both spottily effective. Overall ""Trainwreck"" feels less like a reinvention and more like business as usual. Despite Schumers subversive instincts the romantic comedy remains unchanged. MoviesBig movies out this summer ----- advertisement | advertise on newsday JUDD APATOW FINDS COMEDY IN LOVE ""Trainwreck"" the latest comedy from Judd Apatow marks the Syosset-born filmmakers fifth time behind the camera. Here are the four other feature films directed by Apatow which explore the comic possibilities of trying to make some unlikely relationships work. THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) -- As the title character Steve Carell is reluctant to dive into the dating pool with a single mom (Catherine Keener). The box-office smash made Apatow Hollywoods new wonder man and it didnt hurt Kelly Clarkson who got quite the shoutout from Carell during his waxing scene. KNOCKED UP (2007) -- A successful media personality (Katherine Heigl) and a mega-slacker (Seth Rogen) try to make a go of it after she becomes pregnant following their one-night stand. Apatow has said parts of the film were based on the birth of his daughter Maude. FUNNY PEOPLE (2009) -- A seasoned terminally ill comic (Adam Sandler) takes a green performer (Seth Rogen) under his wing in this bromantic comedy-drama. This was one of Apatows darker films which may explain its mediocre box office take (51.8 million). Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff THIS IS 40 (2012) -- Life doesnt seem to begin at 40 for Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann as marrieds with failing businesses bratty kids and a less than stellar sex life.

Fast forward 20 years and Amy has taken Daddys proclamations to heart as a queen of one-night stands (there are four actors in the films credits listed as ""One Night Stand Guy"").She beds them and leaves them and that is that. Meanwhile Dad now has MS and lives in a nursing home while managing to be as offensive as ever and Amys younger sister Kim (Brie Larson) is settled down with a husband (Mike Birbiglia) and son (Evan Brinkman) whose appeal Amy doesnt get.Amy makes her living writing vaguely scuzzy articles for a vaguely scuzzy magazine where she works for an imperious editor (a barely recognizable Tilda Swinton effortlessly proving she can do anything) and alongside her like-minded friend Nikki (Vanessa Bayer). Amy also has a when-its-convenient boyfriend (John Cena) whos unaware of her other amorous activities.She meets orthopedic surgeon Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) sports doctor to superstars and best buddy to Lebron James (Lebron James) when shes assigned to do a story on Conners. And soon enough shes bedded him as well. But then something strange happens He spends the night (that never happens) and calls her the next day at Lebrons urging to ask her out.What is he some kind of mad stalker?""Im calling the police"" Nikki says.But Amy stops her realizing that she might actually like this guy. And so begins a romance with Amy trying to ignore her fathers words of warning.The stunt casting of Cena and especially James (whos too cheap to pick up dinner checks) works well but a later scene that suddenly drops Matthew Broderick Marv Albert and Chris Evert into the movie falls flat as Apatow stretches things too far. On the other hand a background movie with Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei about professional dogwalking is just strange enough to click.The structure of ""Trainwreck"" is straight romantic comedy with the usual up-down-up dynamic. Its the bits that Schumer brings to the form -- the observations the asides and the naked truths -- that lift the movie. The absolute best thing about this film aside from Schumers strong smart voice is the promise of more to come.

"Trainwreck | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; trainwreck ) Trainwreck (United States 2015) July 16 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli When one considers the impact Judd Apatow has had on the movie scene over the past decade its surprising to realize that Trainwreck is only his fifth feature as a director. This also marks his return to the romantic comedy genre after a two-film break to dabble in dramatic comedies (Funny People This is 40). As written by the brash funny and often vulgar comedienne Amy Schumer Trainwreck is brash funny and often vulgar. Its raunchiness is a perfect match for the man who made The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. It also has a sweetness and sincerity that recalls Cameron Crowes Jerry Maguire. In fact the use of a musical cue (Billy Joels ""Uptown Girl"") as a romantic gesture is taken out of Crowes playbook (""In Your Eyes"" Say Anything). In recent years the adult romantic comedy has come upon hard times after once being among the most reliably popular movie genres. Trainwreck represents the first successful one of 2015. The film gleefully embraces both its romantic and comedic elements. In fact its more amusing than most productions that fall under this umbrella and the love story aspect hits the right notes while avoiding the sour ones. (We are not for example subjected to any ""romantic complications"" that arise from a third-act emergence of an ex-lover whose sole purpose is to keep the protagonists apart until the happy ending.) Schumers screenplay which includes some autobiographical details but is not strictly autobiographical adds a twist to a traditional trope the romance between a commitment-phobic individual who never spends the night and someone whos looking for love and not afraid to admit it.  Its When Harry Met Sally except in this case ""Sally"" is a man and ""Harry"" is a woman. To that end Schumer takes on the role of Amy whose sexual traits are those movies (and society?) typically associates with men. Bill Haders Aaron on the other hand is the more insecure and serious partner. He recognizes the nature of their feelings before she does and when he voices them she freaks out. Although Trainwreck is primarily about how Amy and Aaron meet (shes a magazine reporter doing a feature on him a rising doctor in sports medicine) it illuminates other aspects of Amys life. She has a fractious relationship with her conventional sister Kim (Brie Larson).  She also has a deep bond with her dying father (Colin Quinn) whose advice of ""Monogamy isnt realistic"" has become her lifes slogan. This is Apatows first New York film but his approach isnt a Woody Allen love letter. He gives the metropolis its due with skyline and street shots but the majority of the action could take place in any big city. Apatow is more interested in the characters than the setting. His star is Schumer who is as funny and charismatic on the big screen as she is on the small one - she radiates self-confidence while being self-deprecating but theres an unexpected wellspring of vulnerability under everything.  This quality makes Amy endearing. Bill Hader continues his evolution as an actor who is equally comfortable and capable in both funny and serious roles. Eventually maybe the Academy will stop overlooking him. Trainwreck features a few notable supporting performances. LeBron James plays an exaggerated version of himself erudite penny-pinching and egotistical he waxes poetic about Cleveland and stages an intervention (featuring Marv Albert doing play-by-play for Chris Evert and Matthew Broderick - you have to see it to understand it). Im not prepared to say that James is a good actor but his performance isnt awkward. As stunt casting goes its not unlike what Mike Tyson contributed to The Hangover (although James has more screen time than Tyson did). Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei have small roles in a film-within-the-film. Tilda Swinton is at her most outrageous as Amys editor. And musclebound John Cena is cast against type as a sensitive guy who needs to be coached about how to talk dirty during sex. Trainwreck is a delight for many reasons not the least of which is that the pairing of Schumer and Hader works. Amy and Aaron arent paper characters going through the pre-determined motions of a formula-driven script. By taking the time to flesh them out as real people with relatable problems Apatow involves us in their story. He also accomplishes a rare feat making a two-hour comedy that loses neither its humor nor its appeal over its running length. Trainwreck is anything but what the title would imply.

Thank the goddess. At long last a believable (albeit exaggerated) female character materializes in Trainwreck a loosely autobiographical tale from Schumer about a woman with an XXL libido and non-existent self-esteem. The comic has said that her film character is not too far from who she was at college a party-hearty girl who is just trying to figure it all out. Schumer stars in Trainwreck as Amy a hard-drinking tart with no interest in relationships and nothing but disdain for her happily married sister (Brie Larson). And her sisters goofy husband (Mike Birbiglia). We meet these sisters at the top of the movie when they are just little girls listening carefully to their father (Colin Quinn) explain that monogamy isnt realistic ... as he leaves the family. Amy takes the lesson to heart. And becomes the queen of one-night stands as an adult. Not that she lives without rules. Amy never sleeps over never sees the same guy twice and never stops to worry about any of it. Besides family Amys immediate circle includes a local homeless guy (Dave Attell) who hangs out near her place a friend at work (Vanessa Bayer) her manic boss at SNuff mens magazine (Tilda Swinton -- did we know she was hilarious?) and a sort-of boyfriend (John Cena) with issues of his own. Then a funny thing happens when SNuff magazine sends Amy to interview a famous sports doctor named Aaron Connors (Bill Hader). They go for a drink and fall into bed -- so far nothing unusual -- but then to Amys dismay Dr. Connors calls back for more. He likes her. He wants to see her again. Its so weird. Amy has no experience with this sort of thing. On the sidelines of their strange but developing relationship is an interesting crew we get to visit Amys dad at the nursing home where MS forces him to live listen in on Dr. Connors and his buddy (LeBron James) talking about romance visit Amare Stoudemire in hospital watch an art film starring Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei and observe a skit with Matthew Broderick and Chris Evert that doesnt really work. What does it all mean? No idea but its wonderfully funny. Most of the funny originates with Schumer but it helps that Bill Hader is the perfect match for her energy and her comedy; whatever else happens with Trainwreck it proves that Stefon is an ace leading man. Hader also makes various friendship scenes with NBA great James completely believable and that includes their chats about Downton Abbey. The movie may also (heres hoping) win a new audience for such comics as Dave Attell Mike Birbiglia Colin Quinn and Keith Robinson. Theres something generous about the casting in Trainwreck. Schumer had a hand in all that and you get the distinct feeling that she found roles for as many standup talents as she could. Her generosity pays off for the audience of course; Robinson for example only turns up long enough to argue with John Cena in a movie theatre but its a moment of comedy gold. Trainwreck moves itself into a fairly predictable ending. Its not perfect up until that point either. Its a bit too long its a bit too meandering and its got a couple of bits that just dont work -- such as the previously mentioned appearances by Broderick and Evert. Luckily youll be laughing so hard you wont care about any of the imperfections. Surprisingly you may also find yourself quite moved by serious moments in the third act. In Trainwreck we get a female lead who despite her faults has no interest in artifice status cupid finding Mr. Right or impressing anyone anywhere; thats something to celebrate. Just bring on more Amy Schumer please and soon. Twitter LizBraunSun liz.braunsunmedia.ca Readers comments >> By adding a comment on the site you accept our terms and conditions.

"Review Trainwrecks Amy Schumer is raunchy funny and heartfelt - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Trainwrecks Amy Schumer is raunchy funny and heartfelt Review Trainwrecks Amy Schumer is raunchy funny and heartfelt Universal Pictures Amy Schumer and Bill Hader in ""Trainwreck."" Amy Schumer and Bill Hader in ""Trainwreck."" (Universal Pictures) Rebecca KeeganContact Reporter ""Whats wrong with you that you want to be with me?"" asks Amy the intimacy-averse writer whose troubles are the subject of ""Trainwreck"" a surprisingly touching and raucously funny R-rated comedy written by and starring Amy Schumer.The poignant scene arrives in the middle of this broad bawdy movie like a Trojan horse after punchlines about monogamy A-Rod and Staten Island when Amy disappoints her boyfriend Aaron a disarmingly decent sports doctor played by Bill Hader. Schumer and director Judd Apatow seemed at first to be mocking love stories only to reveal that they have actually been making one. Dont be distracted by its low-cut blouse ""Trainwreck"" is all about the heart as the movie asks a question that has paid therapists and pop singers bills for years -- do naughty girls need love too? (Spoiler alert You bet they do). Finding that love involves several hilarious you-only-live-once-era detours for Schumer in the kind of lovable screw-up role that made Bill Murray a star.Apatow working in his signature tone of sweet raunch directs another writers script for the first time and the comedic marriage is a fruitful one as Schumer delivers the kind of tartly feminist laughs that helped her Comedy Central show ""Inside Amy Schumer"" win a Peabody Award this spring and receive seven Emmy nominations on Thursday. In the film shes refined her stand-up and TV persona also named Amy into a hard-partying occasionally clueless writer for a trashy mens magazine who delivers one-liners that communicate both a brash world view and her own crippling emotional defensiveness -- ""Youre gonna lose us the right to vote"" she shouts to some Knicks cheerleaders who made her feel frumpy. The Kim and Amy Schumer show -- just rub it in Amy Kaufman Amy Schumers sister Kim looked down at her belly and frowned. She was sitting next to Amy in the car on the way to a fancy event this past spring unhappy with how she looked. So Amy reached over placed her hand on Kims stomach and rubbed as if she were one of those Buddha statues. Silently... Amy Schumers sister Kim looked down at her belly and frowned. She was sitting next to Amy in the car on the way to a fancy event this past spring unhappy with how she looked. So Amy reached over placed her hand on Kims stomach and rubbed as if she were one of those Buddha statues. Silently... (Amy Kaufman) In scenes like the argument with Haders Aaron -- and even more so a stirring funeral eulogy she delivers -- Schumer also reveals surprising range displaying a true vulnerability that explains the tossed barbs and empty bottles.That her goofy persona plays so well is in part a tribute to Hader a generous dreamboaty straight man. His subtle often wordless reactions perfectly punctuate scenes such as when sports-hating Amy claims her favorite team is the Orlando Blooms. As Amy doubts whether she should be with someone so kind her sister Kim played with warmth and restraint by Brie Larsen assures her that ""Hes the perfect amount of nice that you deserve."" Amy Schumer to star in co-write mother-daughter comedy for Fox Oliver Gettell ""Trainwreck"" writer-actress Amy Schumer sure doesnt seem to be in any danger of derailing. The ascendant comedian has signed on to star in and co-write an untitled mother-daughter comedy for Fox a studio spokesperson confirmed to The Times. Schumer will write the film with her sister Kim Caramele... ""Trainwreck"" writer-actress Amy Schumer sure doesnt seem to be in any danger of derailing. The ascendant comedian has signed on to star in and co-write an untitled mother-daughter comedy for Fox a studio spokesperson confirmed to The Times. Schumer will write the film with her sister Kim Caramele... (Oliver Gettell) The cast is studded with recognizable comics most notably Colin Quinn as Amy and Kims father Gordon who appears in the opening scene in a childhood flashback to establish Amys commitment-phobia origin story. Like Schumers real father Gordon has multiple sclerosis and her empathy for him hints at her struggle to show such kindness to herself. Schumers comedy has come under criticism lately for what the Guardian called a ""blind spot about race"" and she recently apologized on Twitter for an old stand-up joke about Latino men. Shes clearly evolving in her voice as a writer and Quinns character who spouts offensive comments about nearly every type of human being while still remaining defiantly charming seems to embody an idea she wants to express -- that sometimes the people we care about the most are racist homophobic or otherwise deeply flawed. Its an idea I hope she continues to develop as a comic.Other gems in the supporting cast include Tilda Swinton an utterly unrecognizable testament to the power of bronzer as Amys deliciously mean editor Mike Birbiglia as her sweet lumpy brother-in-law and stand-up comic Dave Attell as a homeless guy who narrates her frequent walks of shame. LeBron James who plays himself as a friend and patient of Aarons has the most significant role of several athletes who appear in the film and his performance reflects impressive off-court timing and a sense of humor about his own image.At just over two hours the feature is Apatows shortest ever as a director but it still could use a haircut and some scenes seem to exist solely for their punchlines not to advance the story. Its awfully entertaining though to see the man behind the bro comedies ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" shooting a womans world with the help of ""Tiny Furniture"" cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes.Apatow also produced the Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo script ""Bridesmaids"" and Lena Dunhams HBO show ""Girls"" and his work with female collaborators is some of his best. In its R-rated comedic portrayal of sex from a female point of view ""Trainwreck"" continues in a more graphic way a path forged memorably by Meg Ryans fake-orgasm scene in ""When Harry Met Sally.""""Trainwreck"" is stuffed with visual references to other New York-set films including ""Working Girl"" and ""Manhattan"" and makes terrific use of the city as a backdrop for love with exuberant set pieces particularly a courtship montage in Central Park and a final energetic cheer-worthy sequence shot at Madison Square Garden.Schumer and Apatow seem to be aiming for an updated version of those kind of smart funny and heartfelt comedies of an earlier era. Thats a high bar and even if they dont quite clear it both star and director have raised each others game.rebecca.keeganlatimes.com------------TrainwreckRated R for strong sexual content nudity language and some drug useRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesPlaying In general release SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTERS Indie Focus Your field guide to only good moviesClassic Hollywood A weekly email celebrating the Golden Age of HollywoodEssential Arts amp; Culture A curated look at SoCals wonderfully vast and complex arts world Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Movies Entertainment Amy Schumer Judd Apatow Kristen Wiig Lena Dunham Amy Schumer I dont try to be feminist.

Close Join the conversation... On Facebook With Chris Vognar Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh The commitment-phobic lover doesnt like to stay the night or spoon or talk about kids. Pillow talk? Not a fan. These emotional isolators tend to be men at least in the movies. But not in Trainwreck the big-screen coming-out party for the exceptionally funny Amy Schumer.Known primarily for her Comedy Central series Inside Amy Schumer Schumer who also wrote Trainwreck is a master of bawdy self-deprecation. The Amy she plays here drinks like one of the guys and blithely hops from bed to bed. Her one-night stands rarely make it to the morning after; when they do theyre summarily dismissed.Schumer finds a fine directorial match here in Judd Apatow. Hes the king of arrested-development comedy and hes long displayed a feminist streak by wedging strong female characters into his tableaux of dudes and their bongs. Apatow like Schumer also goes heavy on improv which can be good and bad. Many sequences in Trainwreck are explosively funny and loose. Like other Apatow productions the movie also settles into a narrative listlessness that prevents the best pieces from forming a fully coherent whole. Amy writes for a tawdry lifestyles magazine that goes by the delicious name of Snuff. Her toxic editor (Tilda Swinton terrific as always) notes Amys overt hostility toward sports and assigns her a profile of an eminent and well-adjusted sports surgeon (Bill Hader). Wouldnt you know it she falls for the nice guy. He reciprocates. And she responds by activating her well-honed flight instincts.""Youre pretty-ish and youre not gorgeous."" Thats Amys boss paying her a backhanded compliment but like the rest of the film the line was written by the star. Schumer doesnt look or act like a supermodel and her regular-girl appeal allows her to get away with saying all manner of inappropriate stuff. Shes also adept at wordless comedy and shes quick to form droll facial reactions that dont need excess verbiage. Shes the real deal.In its own meandering way so is Trainwreck. Apatow may have trouble telling a tight story but hes always had a gift for allowing pungent emotional moments to peek out between the punch lines. Amy is the way she is because of her father an aging philanderer played with understated savvy by Colin Quinn. Their bond is complicated by Amys sister (Brie Larson) married with a kid and with a firm understanding that the old man is kind of a jerk. Apatow and Schumer know that sturdy comedy benefits from the stuff of real life and they supply it in consistent and sneaky fashion. LeBron James and Bill Hader in ""Trainwreck."" (Universal Pictures) Universal Pictures/TNS They also know how to let other people riff. LeBron James - yes that LeBron James - steals a few scenes as a skinflint starry-eyed romantic version of himself. (Other sports cameos include Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo.) Swinton Quinn and Larson all get chances to shine as do Mike Birbiglia Vanessa Bayer John Cena Dave Attell Randall Park and Ezra Miller. Trainwreck possesses a generosity of spirit that makes its bagginess more than tolerable.Most important its got Schumer a comedian seizing her moment. Heres hoping she makes herself comfortable and sticks around a while. TRAINWRECK (B+)Directed by Judd Apatow. R (strong sexual content nudity language and drug use). 125 mins. In wide release.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday July 16 2015 Follow AnnHornaday Amys (Amy Schumer) attitudes about men might change after she meets Aaron (Bill Hader) a sweet sports doctor. (Universal Pictures) Stand-up comedian and Comedy Central phenom Amy Schumer proves her cinematic bona fides in ""Trainwreck"" a strikingly assured feature film debut in which she proves herself as authentic an actress as she is deft as a writer. A warm anarchic romantic comedy about a promiscuous journalist adrift in modern-day New York ""Trainwreck"" hews to the now-familiar contours of raunchy R-rated comedy It trafficks in the frank dialogue absurd sexual situations and mortifying visual stunts familiar to viewers who made ""Knocked Up"" ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"" huge hits. But Schumer -- apple-cheeked and blue-eyed with the mouth of a longshoreman and the countenance of a choir girl -- infuses the genre with rare warmth and emotional honesty. Beneath the bravado and how-low-can-I-go posturing beats the fragile heart of a flawed funny fascinatingly contradictory woman. [How Amy Schumer went from unknown stand-up comic to movie star] Schumer plays a character named Amy whom we meet as a 9-year-old girl in the opening scene of ""Trainwreck"" as her father (Colin Quinn) explains why hes leaving her mother comparing marriage to playing with the same boring old doll all your life. ""Monogamy isnt realistic"" he insists. Twenty-three years later Amy has taken that lesson to heart. Her younger sister (played as an adult by Brie Larson) has gotten married to a good if slightly nerdy guy (Mike Birbiglia) but Amy is creeped out by their domestic bliss. She prefers to drink get high and cheat on her bodybuilder boyfriend (John Cena) with an ever-changing roster of anonymous one-night stands whom she routinely dispatches before the sun comes up. Amy Schumers ""Trainwreck"" is another example of a modern romantic comedy where the female lead is a bit of a mess. From the 1990s alpha girls to the female-driven ""Bridesmaids"" The Posts Alyssa Rosenberg traces the evolution of romantic comedy heroines. (Jayne W. Orenstein and Alyssa Rosenberg/The Washington Post) Amys party-hearty lifestyle provides plenty of comic fodder in ""Trainwreck."" She compares one dates physical endowments to the ""whole cast of Game of Thrones "" then after attaining her own sexual satisfaction promptly falls asleep. But its clear that Amys commitment-phobia and compulsive self-medication are masking more primal wounds which come to the surface when she meets a sweet sports doctor named Aaron (Bill Hader) and when her troubled relationship with her father takes an unexpectedly somber turn. Schumer handles that emotional pivot with exceptional skill and honesty. What makes ""Trainwreck"" work is that she approaches every beat -- funny serious and in-between -- in an open undefended state. And shes blessed with the perfect opposite number in Hader who delivers yet another heartfelt hugely appealing performance as a decent if slightly out-of-his-depth Everyman. His scenes with LeBron James -- who playing himself delivers lines about topics including ""Downton Abbey"" and splitting a lunch check with expert deadpan timing -- lope along with companionable low-key ease. (The film is studded with star-athlete cameos and features one flawlessly constructed A-Rod joke.) ""Trainwreck"" is directed by Judd Apatow whose films have a tendency to sag bag and bulge at the edges. This film has the same overlong digressive streak but its in the service of Schumer whom Apatow naturally follows wherever she goes even when she winds up in one or two cul-de-sacs. Tilda Swinton is funny as Amys brittle British editor but her scenes have a perfunctory jaggedly unfinished rhythm. A recurring movie-within-the-movie starring two recognizable actors feels like a juicy opportunity missed and jokes about the racist assumptions Amy has inherited from her father fall thuddingly flat. Schumers ""Trainwreck"" character has been compared to Apatows similarly directionless infantile male protagonists but in many ways she resembles his finest artistic creation the complex conflicted Lindsay Weir of his television series ""Freaks and Geeks."" Amy exudes more sexual confidence but possesses similar self-doubt and what just might be a tentative sense of worth. ""Trainwreck"" ends on a triumphant but also ambivalent note with a gloriously goofy set piece thats adorable physically brave and completely disarming. But its nod to health and newfound maturity notwithstanding it also feels like a wholesale -- and unnecessary -- capitulation. Theres no doubt that Amys happy ending is earned and worth cheering. Viewers are left hoping that contentment wont make her any less amazing. R. At area theaters.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Every few blue moons a movie will come along that undoes the top button of your work shirt and kisses you on the mouth. Attention must be paid when a film that audacious shows up. While I cant say I felt love at first sight for ""Trainwreck"" it is a raw and honest romantic farce even when it is upside-down wrong. The film is the widescreen debut of Comedy Central star Amy Schumer. She wrote and stars as Amy Townsend a boozy mid-30s New York journalist. If Beauty and the Beast mated their child would be movie-Amy. Her busy commitment-averse sex life is a form of emotional eating and guys are her favorite snack. Her attitude arrived when her dad (Colin Quinn) told his two preteen daughters he was divorcing Mom to keep his dating options open. He and the girls chat outside with a lightning storm approaching as he teaches them to repeat his mantra ""monogamy is a lie."" Twenty years later Amys younger but more mature sister Kimberly (Brie Larson) has a good husband a loving son and a beautiful home. Echoing her chauvinist father Amy has the gall to scoff throwing Kims blessings into question always imagining intimacys stagnant conclusions. Amys closest proxy to a long-term relationship is bulky bodybuilder Steven (wrestling star John Cena) spouting meathead bedroom talk that resembles a sales pitch for protein bars. Schumer is not near the league of Jennifer Lawrence or Kristin Wiig but the pair make a good comic duo. Director Judd Apatow has a gift for bringing out his casts best. When Amy and Steven realize that theyre parting the film humanizes both with vulnerability forcing us to care about them. Apatow balances over-the-top fun with vivid serious acting. It resists the impulse to simply please. In her work life Amy is pushing toward a top job at SNuff a nervy lifestyle mag. Publishing exposes like ""Ugliest Celebrity Kids Under Six"" its formula is Death to Anyone Our Editor Dislikes both in print and on the staff. Tilda Swinton is priceless as the scabrous boss every smile dripping cobra venom. ""Trainwreck"" is filled with knockout cameo roles. One of its greatest highlights is a beyond-brilliant performance by LeBron James playing himself which would earn him an MVP award in any championship comedy team. Amy has the strong ego needed to write -- to do anything really -- yet her ego is the thing that holds her back. When shes assigned to profile prominent sports doctor Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) Amy pitches the endearing fellow into bed. Her wham-bam sex life is so cavalier as to be comical but the films focus shifts with Haders character in the mix. Aaron is thinly drawn but when he tells Amy with a pained-looking deadpan that hes got genuine boyfriend feelings for her the story grows poignant. Trainwreck  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong sexual content nudity language and some drug use. As the character Schumer is warmly approachable even when being careless and offensive as is the movie. But shes capable of going too far wearing out her welcome as the film unspools over more than two hours. The project Schumer wrote for herself unquestionably feels like a personal film and I congratulate her for having the courage to make it. Amy and Kim (named after Schumers real-life sister) share emotional scars from their parents divorce. They cope in conflict with their fathers decline as he faces a long serious illness Not a lot of people throw themselves headfirst into a project like this. ""Trainwreck"" is a lesson on taking a profile too deep. It makes its lead a woman who gives a lot of people bruised feelings (even viewers; a deeply creepy encounter near the climax pulled me out of my comedy comfort zone). The film is about trying to tap into the great mysteries of romance a story it tells with dramatic-comedic tonal shifts in jokes and out of sync paradoxes that make it feel all over the map. Apatows breakout hits ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" had a similar recipe but the happy ending of ""Trainwreck"" is out of harmony. The characters ached too much to exit in laughs. When it was over I felt I was leaving the theater with all sorts of unresolved ideas tacked and taped to my head. ""Trainwreck"" is not a catastrophe but no triumph either. Its like an ambitious experiment too intriguing and meaningful to be dismissed outright too flawed to be deeply admired. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Ms. Tilda Swinton.But seriously. Swinton is amazing as a bad boss but shes an Oscar winner and her shape-shifting brilliance is not entirely unexpected. Yet nobody expected that a midsummer release could be lifted to a new level by a film-comedy novice such as ... pro wrestler John Cena.OK OK. Were running from the obvious like a virgin on a date with Dracula. Amy Schumer is so scary-good in ""Trainwreck"" that it almost seems risky to speak her name. But we have no choice. She plays a bed-hopping boozer named Amy a writer at a Manhattan magazine that caters to twentysomething dudes with sexist articles such as ""You call those (breasts)?"" Swinton plays her barely human editor and when she learns that Amy knows nothing about sports she sadistically assigns her to interview the NBAs leading knee surgeon Dr. Aaron Conners (Bill Hader).A recurring joke here is that all the men in Amys life -- with the exception of her angrily divorced and dying dad (Colin Quinn) -- are sensitive pushovers. So when Amy and Aaron go on a research date that ends at the doctors bedroom hes a wounded puppy dog when she doesnt want to snuggle afterward. Likewise James plays a version of himself who loves ""Downton Abbey"" and Cena plays a muscle-bound hookup whose idea of talking dirty is reciting a locker-room pep talk.""Trainwreck"" was written by Schumer a movie newcomer who stars in the sketch show ""Inside Amy Schumer"" on Comedy Central. Her blunt perspective on female sexuality in the social-network era is being treated as something new. But the film was directed by Judd Apatow whose credits stretch from ""Freaks and Geeks"" to ""This Is Forty"" so it never feels like a feminist manifesto. This is a fully fleshed-out movie the funniest of the year. Apatow still has trouble trimming his comedies to the traditional 100-minute format. (Schumer spends an extra 25 minutes wondering whether shes ready to commit to the nicest guy in the world.) Yet we can hardly blame him for letting his likable writer/star improvise before she shoots 3-pointers from outside the bounds of good taste. As much as it might pain a man to say so Schumer has the ball skills to be the next LeBron James.What ""Trainwreck""  31/2 stars out of four  Run time 205  Rating R  Content Strong sexual content nudity language and some drug use Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Queens of comedy Amy Schumer and other ladies who make us LOL Amy Schumers ""Trainwreck"" is the new engine for a long line of funny females.

VPCAmy Schumer wrote and stars in Judd Apatows romantic comedy about a woman opposed to love who accidentally finds it.""Trainwreck"" isnt especially unique but Amy Schumers raw comedic flair makes for a hilarious time.(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsApatow has a lot to do with the underlying sweetness of the film.Schumer and Hader have great chemistry together.Critics rating 4 stars out of 5It sounds condescending to say that Amy Schumer has written for herself in ""Trainwreck"" the kind of choice juicy role men usually get.In fact the very notion sounds like something Schumer would skewer viciously in ""Inside Amy Schumer"" her television show. Yet women too often are relegated to playing cheerful love objects in romantic comedies which beneath all the sex and profane hilarity and drinking and drugging is what ""Trainwreck"" is.Here Schumer playing a woman who boozes and has sex and misbehaves on her own terms gets whats traditionally the male role in this kind of film and with the help of Judd Apatows direction she kills it. She is hilarious fearless in her pursuit of a joke. Things get a little too lovey-dovey at the end -- Apatow tends toward that direction as a general thing. But Schumer who wrote the film has given us someone to root for who at least at the exhilarating start is as much blue-mouthed antihero as heroine.INTERVIEW Amy Schumer talks about engineering TrainwreckThe film begins with Amys father (Colin Quinn) explaining to his young daughters that monogamy simply isnt possible nor should it be attempted. Grown-up Amy has taken this to heart; she has a kind of sort of meathead boyfriend-type person (John Cena an exceedingly good sport) but she sleeps around whenever she likes. She also mocks her sister Kim (Brie Larson) who is happily married with a son.One supposes that with all the meaningless sex and relentless drinking something is missing in Amys life; one supposes that this being a romantic comedy that thing is love. The hard-won emotion arrives in the person of Aaron (Bill Hader) a sports surgeon. Amy a magazine writer is assigned to profile him even though she doesnt like sports. (An unrecognizable Tilda Swinton has a blast as Amys coldly calculating editor.)AZCENTRALTrainwreck (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsAmy is horrified that Aaron not only likes her but is a genuinely good person who is interested in more than what she looks for in a man. Like say staying over (a no-no in her book). Hes friends with LeBron James (playing a miserly version of himself and doing it really well -- hes funny) and a slew of other top athletes. This means nothing to Amy of course but even she notes that its notable.Aaron (Bill Hader) calls Amy to set up another date while receiving tips from LeBron James. (Photo Universal Pictures)An aside The film does a good job with journalism ethics especially an explanation of how ""off the record"" really works (you have to agree to it up front). But once the romance takes off the journalism realism falls by the wayside.Actually thats not an aside. Once the romance takes off the entire film shifts. It becomes more of a conventional romantic comedy albeit one with really dirty words. And it remains hilarious because Schumer seems to be incapable of being anything else.So the movie is still funny but not quite as unique as it was at the start. Which is OK I guess. Apatow rivals Steven Spielberg as a devotee of the overabundance of heart. (Both were children of broken marriages and have said this colored their view once they had control of the way stories end.)Whats nice is how smart the film is. Schumer gives a nod to plenty of other romantic comedies not to make fun of them but to honor them. Being funny is hard work and she has put in the hours of toil. Yet -- and this doubtless has something to do with Apatow -- although shes known for flamethrower truth-telling here there is an underlying sweetness. Surely there is no one who would begrudge her or her character the satisfaction of getting what she deserves. Theres nothing wrong with being happy.""Trainwreck"" is just funnier and more daring when shes not.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Trainwreck a smart funny twist on rom-coms | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTrainwreck a smart funny twist on rom-comsTrainwreck is an unconventional but hilarious romantic comedy starring comedian Amy Schumer. Amy Schumer plays a more out of control version of herself in Trainwreck while Bill Hader plays a tall dark and gangly but charming leading man.  (Tribune News Service)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. July 16 2015TrainwreckStarring Amy Schumer Bill Hader. Directed by Judd Apatow. 125 minutes.Her life may not quite be a trainwreck per se but theres a certain New York magazine writer named Amy who clearly has some growing up to do. Played by Amy Schumer (and inspired by her own life) the other Amy parties too often and has casual sex while regularly mocking her younger sisters conventional lifestyle.Article Continued BelowIn turn shes mercilessly mocked by the homeless guy who lives outside her building on those mornings she comes home wearing last nights clothes.But whats refreshing about Trainwreck is how it takes a woman whose living la vida loca too loud and too large and turns her into a very likable heroine.In a mainstream culture that regularly celebrates promiscuous men as ""players"" theres no slut-shaming going on here. In fact theres a kind of empowered feminism to be found in Amys ways.Inspired by Schumers own standup comedy (she wrote the screenplay) and youve got a film that crackles with edgy and boundary-pushing wit.Trainwreck also plays with the other convention the leading man. Comic Bill Hader may have tall and dark down pat but with that gangly frame and overbite hes never going to be anyones idea of handsome.Director Judd Apatow -- whose previous films such as Knocked Up and Pineapple Express have been so adept at giving relationship comedies a perverse and contemporary spin -- has an easy job here to let Schumer play a slightly elevated version of herself and to let Hader playing a sports doctor shes interviewing for a magazine article pursue her despite some obvious reluctance on her part.What ensues is a madcap but surprisingly sweet romantic comedy bolstered by sharp dialogue and some great backup performances many of them delivered by actual comedians who probably never imagined themselves as actors. That includes Colin Quinn who brings an unexpected poignancy to the role of her father stricken with multiple sclerosis (as in Schumers own life). The opening scene in which he lectures a childhood Amy and younger sister Kim on the futility of monogamy sets the stage for the future Amys dissolute life.Saturday Night Live cast member Vanessa Bayer makes the best of her small role as kooky office mate Nikki and raunch comic Dave Attell milks the laughs as homeless guy Noam.Theres also a pleasant surprise to be had in Tilda Swintons role as over-the-top magazine boss Dianna -- a satirical take on the British tabloid editor stereotype -- whose every utterance is screamingly funny.Appearances by muscle-bound WWE star John Cena as one of Amys (temporary) suitors and basketball superstar LeBron James as LeBron James are less successful and the joke in cameo performances by Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei is likely to go over most peoples heads.But Schumer who has studied acting seriously demonstrates a real ability to invest her character with both world-weary humour and humanity while Hader is a geeky but winning Prince Charming.Trainwreck is going to have audiences laughing frequently and uproariously even as it finds in quieter moments ways to inject real heart and soul in an otherwise zany romantic comedy.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Otherwise this is a deeply lazy and sentimental raunch comedy from director Judd Apatow and writer-star Amy Schumer. Basically a marshmallow covered with bodily fluids. Lazy characters who are little more than gag bags e.g. a barely repressed gay bodybuilder boyfriend who also dreams of marriage and family with our heroically promiscuous heroine a 16-year-old Mamas boy intern whos also deep into Samp;M and cross-gender roleplay. Lazier characters who are pure cliche dopey bro-in-law bitchy ladyboss suburban momster. Sentimental claiming that the same Dad who incessantly cheated on Mom and so destroyed their marriage was also the greatest Dad who always made you feel loved and important. More sentimental the narrative treatment of a damaged party girl dealing with the terrifying gift of true unconditional grownup love. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

James is in one of the films funnier scenes -- but without Schumer. Photo Mary Cybulski Associated Press Amy Schumers Trainwreck movie goes off the rails 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""You are not nice."" When Bill Hader says that to Amy Schumer -- they play a boyfriend and girlfriend going through a difficult patch -- it would really help the experience if the whole audience didnt think ""Yes youre right. Youre a nice guy. Why are you with this awful woman?"" Romantic comedies can go in all sorts of directions but they depend on the audiences believing that a couple should get together and stay together. But in ""Trainwreck"" that belief is hard to come by. The movie boasts the best title of any comedy this summer. People will want to see it on the basis of the title alone and yet the titles promise is unfulfilled. Amy Schumer who wrote the screenplay and stars in the movie is both not enough of a train wreck here and too much of one. That is the character she plays is not so off the charts as to be amazing funny and outrageous. But she is just enough of a train wreck to be unpleasant selfish and obnoxious. Every viewer will have his or her own reaction and how that goes will determine the movies success or failure. Schumer a stand-up comic with very little experience in feature films gets the showcase of a lifetime in ""Trainwreck"" with Judd Apatow directing her screenplay in a high-profile film. But he turns out not to have been the ideal director for her. At the very least her performance seems unguided with the director endorsing her too completely and uncritically without the specific and knowing attention he might have lavished on say Seth Rogen. He allows her to be harsh where she should be soft and angry when she might have had doubt. Schumers intention may have been to play the role of Amy as a hard-partying but at-heart-sensitive woman. Instead she gives us someone who is hard on the outside and even harder on the inside. Theres sentiment even borderline sentimentality in her performance but no warmth or generosity. Maybe they should have kept Schumer as the writer but hired someone else to star in the movie. You know that something has gone wrong when the two or three funniest scenes dont have Schumer in them. For example theres one in which Hader who plays a sports doctor is playing basketball with a friend and talking about his girlfriend. Its the obligatory scene between buddies one youve seen a hundred times before only in this case the friend is LeBron James playing himself. Gradually you realize that the doctor is not scoring at all and keeps getting the ball taken from him. But the two never note this; they just keep talking. Watching ""Trainwreck"" with a large audience one can feel the crowd rooting for it expecting it to be hilarious and then giving up. An early scene in which two women in adjoining bathroom stalls compare their favorite Johnny Depp movies falls flat. Another one in which Schumer as a magazine writer attends a staff meeting almost lands but mainly thanks to Tilda Swinton as the heartless high-strung editor. Most of the humor trades on unexpected coarseness though given the way Schumer plays Amy the coarseness isnt unexpected and is never as funny as it might have been. There are about a dozen good laughs which amounts to one every 10 minutes in a movie that runs just over two hours. Colin Quinn has a funny early scene as Amys father and Brie Larson as Amys sister steals all her scenes from Schumer just by listening and staying in the moment. ""Trainwreck"" is far from terrible and to be sure Schumer has some good scenes -- a serious one at a funeral is a dramatic highlight. And its hard to dislike a movie that gives laugh lines to the veteran actor Norman Lloyd who is 100 years old. Still once the thought crosses the mind it never leaves Much of whats wrong with ""Trainwreck"" would have disappeared and much of whats good could have been amplified if only Schumer and Larson had switched roles.

Share Tweet High expectations have not been a part of the romantic comedy game for some time but thats exactly what Amy Schumer and Judd Apatows Trainwreck faces--at least from fans of its star and screenwriters (mostly) sketch comedy series Inside Amy Schumer. Schumers biggest fans may not be expecting a rom-com at all but that is more or less what Trainwreck offers albeit with much bigger laughs and more resonant emotion than the genre has seen in a while. In keeping with her sketch-comedy tradition Schumer plays another woman named Amy this version living in New York working at a magazine and worrying about her cantankerous father Gordon (Colin Quinn) who has recently moved into an assisted-living facility. In the opening scene Gordon advises a preteen Amy and her little sister Kim (well played as an adult by Brie Larson) that monogamy is a losing proposition and while grown-up Amy recognizes her fathers failings she both makes excuses for him and more or less lives by his advice casually dating a gym rat (John Cena) while hooking up with various one-night guys on the side. When she meets Aaron (Bill Hader) a successful sports surgeon they manage to go on several dates. Suddenly Amy finds herself perilously close to a serious relationship.Its a tricky thing in romantic comedy modulating the central couples obstacles. If theyre too big overcoming them can feel like an epic contrivance; if theyre too small theres the risk of seeming pointlessly easy. Trainwreck sticks to smallness but in the best way. Amys struggles with commitment alcohol and empathy sting and sometimes visibly unnerve Aaron. Though Schumer has plenty of funny lines shes not just spouting zingers; theres a real hostility in Amy Townsend that makes her pettier tenser and more interesting than a lot of fictional single gals making their way in the city. (As such she may further ruffle the feathers of the real-life Schumers more vigilant critics--and even fans who have come to expect or even demand trenchant social commentary from all of her material). ""Youre not nice"" someone tells Amy at one point and its hard to argue. On the guy side the movie makes Aaron sweetly imperfect in his attempts to forge ""normal"" couplehood with her. Though Apatow didnt co-write Trainwreck--its the first movie hes directed without his name on the screenplay--his influence is all over the movies view of relationships as real if ultimately rewarding work.That influence also provides a default comic style for a voice presumably more accustomed to the shorter narratives of stand-up and sketches. It creates a hybrid aesthetic especially evident in Amys job at SNuff where the staff works on articles with titles like ""Ugliest Celebrity Kids Under 6."" Its a very Schumer riff on faux-irreverent faux-culture magazines and websites located in a very Apatow workplace intimidating including a vaguely threatening boss (here played by Tilda Swinton only semi-recognizable) yet with a seemingly undemanding workload that provides plenty of time for coworker-related riffs (here provided by Swinton Vanessa Bayer Jon Glaser and Randall Park). A few of Apatows go-to moves provide an unnecessary crutch here propping up a comic who can stand on her own the endless side characters (funny but sometimes interchangeable) the sports cameos subbing in for the Hollywood cameos and an odd running gag (featuring even more celebrity cameos) of characters watching a black-and-white movie that plays a like a parody of an indie movie made by someone whos only heard about them secondhand. (That may well be a creation of Schumers script; either way its not as funny as its supposed to be.)In terms of its own genre Trainwreck never approaches full-on parody but it does tweak some familiar conventions without excess meta-commentary When Hader plays casual dude-talk basketball for example its with LeBron James appearing as himself in a bona fide supporting role and doing a surprisingly credible job as Aarons best friend. The New York setting too is something of a rom-com trope--just ask They Came Together--but Apatow adjusts to his first non-Los Angeles movie with a grainier celluloid texture courtesy of cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes who shot much of the first season of Girls as well as Lena Dunhams feature Tiny Furniture. The more overtly comic dialogue-heavy scenes still require plenty of coverage but in more intimate scenes Apatow places trust in his visuals like a lovely two-shot of Schumer and Hader sitting in a cab after shes invited herself home with him. When they get to his apartment the first chunk of the scene plays out in a single dimly lit take. In these moments Trainwreck turns sex farce into genuine romance and throughout the movie the handling of Amys family troubles is sincerely touching. Despite Schumers joke-heavy sketch background this isnt Apatows funniest feature on a laughs-per-minute level. But unlike many comic vehicles and just as many big-city romances its a real and ultimately rewarding piece of work. A big-studio romantic comedy infused with actual human feeling is just as rare an accomplishment as the perfect comedy sketch.

"Trainwreck review Amy Schumer and Judd Apatows rom-com is not a trainwreck of a movie. Slate Sign In Sign Up Trainwreck Isnt Perfect--but Schumer Pushes the Rom-Com to Places Its Never Been Before Trainwreck Isnt Perfect--but Schumer Pushes the Rom-Com to Places Its Never Been Before Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 16 2015 947 AM Trainwreck Its not one By Dana Stevens Amy Schumer and Bill Hader in Trainwreck. Photo by Mary Cybulski courtesy Universal Studios After youve watched Trainwreck come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion with Dana Stevens and Anne Helen Petersen. You can also download the podcast here. The wiki site TV Tropes in its infinite nomenclatural wisdom has created a term for films or TV shows in which the protagonists first name is also the name of the lead actor the Danza (after Tony Danza who played a guy named Tony in two long-running sitcoms Taxi and Whos the Boss?). There are many reasons to pull a Danza but the most important has to do with name recognition as brand leverage. Some performers especially stand-up comedians (think Louis C.K. or Roseanne Barr) are so identified with their names that basing a character on their stage persona and then giving that character a different name just seems like a needless waste of ready-to-hand audience goodwill. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Advertisement Judd Apatows Trainwreck scripted by and starring Amy Schumer--who hosts the similarly eponymous Comedy Central sketch show Inside Amy Schumer--goes full Danza christening its leading lady ""Amy"" in a film populated by other well-known comics not using their own first names. That choice in itself says a lot about the cultural place Amy Schumer occupies at this moment that of a brashly honest young comedian whos building a successful career on the radical premise that even as a pretty blonde woman who talks a lot about sex she intends to get away with being exactly who she is. The arrival of Trainwreck in theaters feels major--not because its a perfect movie by any stretch but because it marks the big-screen arrival of Amy a character/creator/performer who takes the romantic-comedy heroine and the onscreen treatment of feminism to places theyve seldom if ever been before. The Amy who Amy plays in Trainwreck isnt a rapidly rising TV comedian (that would be an ""As Herself"" not a Danza). Shes a staff writer for a glossy mens magazine called (A-plus on this joke) SNuff. At their editorial meetings headed up by a spray-tanned and near-unrecognizable Tilda Swinton un-shamefaced journalists pitch headlines such as ""You Call Those Tits?"" and ""Youre Not Gay Shes Just Boring."" Despite her complete indifference to sports (I feel you sister) Amy is saddled with the assignment of profiling a prominent sports-medicine specialist Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) whos also known for his volunteer work with Doctors Without Borders. Dr. Conners is earnest serious and deeply committed to his job--a far cry from the ambitious but self-sabotaging Amy whos so alienated by her soulless workplace that she parties just a shade too hard sometimes waking up in a borough she doesnt even remember going to and stumbling her way home in red stiletto heels. (Schumers brilliant bit of physical comedy on that Staten Island walk of shame provides the closest onscreen approximation Ive seen of what walking in very high heels after a long night on the town feels like.) It doesnt take long until Amy and Aaron have slept together (because it doesnt take long till Amy and anyone have slept together) but they each respond to the encounter very differently. Hes smitten calling her the next day with an invitation to dinner; shes so used to casual hookups shes almost offended by his show of interest. As weve learned from a brief opening flashback Amy is the child of a proud philanderer (Colin Quinn in a dryly funny and ultimately moving performance) who used to lecture his two young daughters on the impossibility of monogamy. The adult Amy has absorbed his lesson resisting intimacy in favor of a series of one-night stands and an occasional night at the movies with a pea-brained gym rat (the pro wrestler John Cena who lays bare nearly everything in one bravura comic sex scene). Amys younger sister Kim (Brie Larson) grew up to prove her dad wrong--shes happily married to a sweet suburban dork (Mike Birbiglia) and stepmother to his ultrageeky preteen son (Evan Brinkman nailing the kind of exuberant kid energy thats endearing if you love the kid in question and exhausting if--like Amy at least when we first meet her--you dont). Amy and Kims unrepentant scalawag of a father is now in a wheelchair because of MS--a disease that afflicts Schumers father in real life--and the sisters have reluctantly and somewhat resentfully moved him out of his house into an expensive nursing home. He wasnt much of a dad they say to each other (and when his racist misogynist wisecracks get on their nerves to him) but since they lost their mother years ago hes all theyve got. Advertisement Thats a lot of painful backstory for a romantic comedy heroine but one of the charms of the emotionally capacious Trainwreck is that the non-romantic plotlines dont really count as backstory. The rocky but loving relationships Amy has with her father and sister are every bit as important to the story as the connection she shares with her (would-be) boyfriend and all three parts of her life affect and change one another just like in--imagine that--real life. And theres at least one important friendship at stake too--the bond between Haders Aaron and LeBron James (as himself). Aaron is LeBrons doctor but also his confidant brunch buddy and--in a scene thats hilarious whether you care about sports or not--one-on-one basketball partner. The rom-com cliche of dudes confiding their love problems over a game of pick-up ball--amusingly satirized in David Wains 2014 spoof They Came Together--gets a new slapstick twist when one of the two dudes in question can pluck the basketball from the others hands like a giant bending down to pick a dandelion. James gives a funny performance off-court too his placid comic timing meshing nicely with Haders more anxious energy as he earnestly urges his doctor-turned-pal to give Cleveland a chance (""You know Clevelands great for the whole family right?"") then tries to weasel out of paying his half of the brunch check. Like nearly all of Apatows films Trainwreck could lose 20 minutes. A scene in which LeBron stages a relationship intervention with Haders character aided by Marv Albert Chris Evert and for some reason Matthew Broderick (all ""as themselves"") veers so far into sketch-comedy zaniness that it breaks the movies comic rhythm. And at this point in rom-com history youre only allowed a third-act ""separation montage"" set to a wistful pop song if you do something new with the formula which Apatow and Schumer really dont. Trainwreck also contains an odd strain of racial humor involving its white heroines discomfort around black people that needed to be either explored further or cut. Asked to produce a photo of herself with a black friend--a bizarre request in itself--Amy frantically scrolls through her phone finds a picture of a waiter pouring her water and tries to pass him off as her BFF. Later in the subway she gets a dressing-down from a black woman who seems to have been brought in mainly to provide a soupcon of ghetto sass. Im not sure these moments would have stood out as much if Schumer hadnt recently been criticized for her shows treatment of race but they would definitely still have registered.

More... Join In I cant get into the ending of Trainwreck without spoilage but I found the final scene faintly disappointing--too unquestioning of the happy-ever-after cliches familiar from more sexist less interesting comedies with a plot-logic hole you could drive LeBron James through. But the movie still sent me out of the theater smiling because--as a booty-shaking dance number makes clear--Amy playing ""Amy"" has arrived on the big screen and shes not going anywhere.

Proof is in her Comedy Central series Inside Amy Schumer with its classic skits on Bill Cosby and whether Schumer is hot enough for TV. Proof positive is in her starring movie debut in Trainwreck. In the lead role and as screenwriter -- with director Judd Apatow expertly harnessing her energy not taming it -- Schumer is a whole summer of comic fireworks wrapped in one ballsy package. Or is that sexist? Heads up guys. Schumers assault on caveman attitudes hits like a kick in the nut sack.

Any number of romantic comedies since the dawn of time have seen the brash Lothario fall into the tender trap of Miss Right but ""Trainwreck"" puts the formula on its ear by making Dr. Right a man while the promiscuous party animal is -- gasp -- a woman. That this particular woman happens to have been written and portrayed by Amy Schumer goes a long way toward making this sharp funny film more than just a mere switcheroo of longstanding gender roles. Her scathing brilliant Comedy Central series ""Inside Amy Schumer"" takes a scalpel toward prevailing attitudes about sexuality and relationships and while her debut as a screenwriter and leading lady doesnt quite reach the outrageous heights of her TV work ""Trainwreck"" remains hilarious and provocative heralding what we can only hope will be a pot-stirring new voice on the big screen. See Video New Trainwreck Clip Highlights LeBron James Comedy Basketball Skills (Video) Schumer stars as Amy a Manhattan magazine journalist whose high tolerance for tequila shots is matched only by her utter disinterest in settling down. As a child her father (Colin Quinn) told Amy and her sister (played as an adult by Brie Larson) on his way out the door that monogamy is untenable and that life lesson stuck to Amy but not to her sister whos happily married and raising her stepson. Reluctantly accepting an assignment to interview New York Citys hottest sports doctor Aaron (Bill Hader) Amy finds herself so charmed by this sweet dorky guy that after she perfunctorily seduces him she allows herself to be talked into sleeping over usually a no-no for her. As he gets serious and she grows increasingly antsy can this wild child put aside her fears and turn herself into a one-man woman? See Photos Amy Schumer Sleeps With Star Wars Droids R2-D2 C-3PO in Risque GQ Spread (Photos) That question resides firmly in the wheelhouse of director Judd Apatow whose work as a filmmaker in the new millennium has addressed the coming-of-age (or at least the coming-of-thirties) from various angles. ""Trainwreck"" highlights his best and worst instincts as a filmmaker -- on the down side he apparently still cant trim down to a manageable running time yielding scenes that go on too long or lead nowhere particularly interesting. (Actress Becky Ann Baker a veteran of Apatow TV productions ""Girls"" and ""Freaks and Geeks"" appears in one scene with no dialogue implying she probably played a major character who wound up completely excised -- and the movie still runs long.) Where Apatow shines is in his comic staging spotlighting Schumer and Haders facility with both verbal and physical humor and eliciting consistently big laughs from everything including splashy set pieces to muttered asides. And as weve seen in earlier Apatow efforts like ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" ""Knocked Up"" and ""Funny People"" the director shares Preston Sturges love of a deep comedy bench; ""Trainwreck"" delivers a densely packed but never overcrowded army of second bananas possibly one of the most eclectic ones in the history of cinema. Also Read Ant-Man Poised to Crush Amy Schumers Trainwreck Stomp Past Minions at Box Office Where else could Tilda Swinton (hilariously crass in spray tan and blue eye shadow) share billing with 100-year-old movie legend Norman Lloyd pro wrestler John Cena (as a friend with benefits whos blissfully unaware of his repressed sexuality) a gaggle of ""SNL"" vets and stand-up comics and LeBron James the latter showing surprising skill as Aarons friend and confidant? (Its the kind of sassy and supportive best-pal role that less imaginative directors would dump on Schumer in a standard-issue rom-com.) Even if it turns out that the NBA star has only one octaves worth of acting talent Apatow helps James hit every single note in his range. ""Trainwreck"" ultimately comes down in favor of mainstream girl-gets-boy in a way that ""Inside Amy Schumer"" might find a little dubious but it never feels like Schumer is aggressively watering down her uniquely prickly brand of comedy for a mass audience. She never stoops but still she conquers. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Photo Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Trainwreck Running time 122 minutes. Rated R (language sex drug use). ""I dont really like to spoon"" says a panicked Amy (Amy Schumer) while being persuaded by her new boyfriend (Bill Hader) to spend the night. ""If I stay can we sleep in a realistic position?"" Im sure it will be said that Schumer is playing the guy role in ""Trainwreck"" written by her and directed by Judd Apatow whos found his groove collaborating with funny ladies. But thats not the subversive thing about this film; rather its the vulnerable emotionally available men at its center. Photo Universal Studios Hader sweet goofy and down-to-earth seems poised to be this generations Tom Hanks. As Amys so-right-its-painful love interest sports doctor Aaron Conners he sidesteps her manic commitment-phobia with comebacks like ""Well I think we really like each other and we should start dating."" LeBron James playing himself is Aarons sensitive best friend who interrogates Amy thusly ""Do you hear his name when you listen to the wind?"" Even wrestler John Cena as a no-necked Mr. Wrong is crushed when Amy ends things He so wanted her to be his Crossfit Queen. Schumer meanwhile continues her ascent toward unseating Louis CK as Americas top comic. Shes written herself a hell of a prickly role a woman whos internalized the early lessons of her absentee dad (Colin Quinn) ""What if I told you there was only one doll you could play with forever?"" he asks his young daughters by way of informing them he was leaving their mother. In Amys adulthood this plays out as a string of hookups -- enabled by a capacity for drinking herself into believing theyre good ideas -- though shes hardly the disaster the title implies. She works as a writer at a mens magazine SNuff where a near-unrecognizable Tilda Swinton plays her boss a tanned shark whose sole sustenance seems to be misogynist story pitches (""Are You Gay or Is She Just Boring?""). Vanessa Bayer (""SNL"") plays Amys work friend and the two are a united front of over-reactionary female singledom. When Aaron calls to ask Amy for a second date hes immediately deemed a deranged stalker. Photo Universal StudiosIn voice-over throughout Amy cheerfully dismantles rom-com staples. A collection of scenes of her blossoming romance particularly tickles her gag reflex ""I hope this montage ends like Jonestown."" She needles her sister Kim (Brie Larson) about her dorky husband (Mike Birbiglia) and mannered stepson (Evan Brinkman) and early on she cheats on a guy shes seeing (Cena) with countless other men. Shes kind of a jerk which puts her firmly in the tradition of the rom-com dude -- a witty misanthrope who can be reformed through the love of a virtuous significant other. Photo Universal StudiosAt just over two hours the film has ample room for comic asides. In the de rigueur men-shooting-hoops scene James gives it his NBA-star all while playing against the physically hapless Hader. Ezra Miller (""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") as a SNuff intern has a memorable seduction scene in which he gets his freak on. But this is Apatow country which means family and order triumph. I found myself wishing Amys singleness and shameless non-monogamy didnt have to be chalked up to fatherly indoctrination and solved like a problem. In the grand scheme though ""Trainwreck"" is a corrective to a lot of outdated cliches. Its very funny and sweet and even a little weepy and it has maybe the best scene ever filmed of dirty talk gone wrong. In other words its a Schumer/Apatow production -- may there be more of them to come.

EntertainmentMovies Trainwreck A win for Judd Apatow -- and LeBron James Originally published July 16 2015 at 1205 am Updated July 16 2015 at 902 am Amy Schumer stars as a hard-partying magazine writer in ""Trainwreck."" LeBron James plays himself and hes very very funny. (Mary Cybulski / Universal Pictures) A review of ""Trainwreck"" an agreeable Judd Apatow relationship comedy starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Two surprises emerge from the agreeable Judd Apatow/Amy Schumer comedy ""Trainwreck""; namely a) its actually a quite conventional romantic comedy albeit one with a high raunch factor; and b) LeBron James playing himself is very very funny. (Maybe sports fans knew this already? I didnt. But seriously if that basketball thing doesnt work out someone should get this guy his own rom-com; his exuberance and timing particularly when he suddenly starts quoting Kanye West are terrific.) Schumer whos all over the media these days thanks to her hit TV series ""Inside Amy Schumer"" wrote the screenplay and stars in ""Trainwreck"" playing a character loosely based on herself (and it seems Carrie Bradshaw of ""Sex and the City""). Amy Townsend in the film is a hard-drinking hard-partying Manhattan magazine writer with a raucous love life; shes been taught by her rascal father (Colin Quinn) that monogamy isnt realistic. Enter Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) a sweet sports-medicine doctor (James is his patient/best friend) ... and Amy starts to wonder if growing up and settling down might not be the nightmare shes imagined. Theres nothing remotely fresh about this plotline (or the way Apatow true to form makes the movie 20 minutes longer than it should be) but ""Trainwreck"" works as comedy more often than it doesnt -- and thats rare enough. The supporting cast is dotted with funny people; both expected (among the cast are ""Saturday Night Live"" vets Quinn Vanessa Bayer and Leslie Jones) and unexpected. James Marv Albert Chris Evert and Amare Stoudemire (whose stuntman deserves a big hand) contribute good bits as do Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei as stars of a soulful hilarious art-film-within-the-film called ""The Dog Walker."" (Yes I would watch that movie.) And Tilda Swinton cheekbones flaring makes something wickedly brilliant from the role of Amys editor -- if youve ever wondered what sort of magazine the White Witch of Narnia would run wonder no more. Movie Review    Trainwreck with Amy Schumer Bill Hader Brie Larson Colin Quinn John Cena Vanessa Bayer Tilda Swinton LeBron James. Directed by Judd Apatow from a screenplay by Schumer. 122 minutes. Rated R for strong sexual content nudity language and some drug use. Several theaters. The central couple though determines whether a rom-com lives or dies and ""Trainwreck"" gets by on Schumers unexpectedly adorable chemistry with Hader which seems to sneak into the movie almost in spite of itself. Amy Townsend though initially kind of a jerk to Aaron has an inner sweetness that slowly emerges (particularly during one emotional scene that Schumer movingly plays) -- and by the end of the film youre ready to cheer on this couple. And to hope that their buddy LeBron drops by often. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

VPCAmy Schumer and LeBron James bond over Bill Hader in Trainwreck.(Photo Mary Cybulski Universal Pictures)Judd Apatows films have always focused on maturity be it with a 40-year-old virgin or getting knocked up. But in his latest a deconstruction of the romantic comedy star Amy Schumers character easily lives up to the title of Trainwreck. Her New York City life is that of a hedonistic YOLO single She drinks heavily swears just as much and does not a walk but a ferry of shame back home from a Staten Island one-night stand. You know shes going to somehow grow up in the movie ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) but she does it in the most raucous way possible with the help of some amusing athletic supporters.Working at a mens magazine -- with an editor-in-chief played by a nearly unrecognizable Tilda Swinton -- Amys various vices of sex drugs and booze are starting to wear her down while her sister (Brie Larson) and her aging father (Colin Quinn) remind her of the real responsibilities that should be garnering her attention instead of nightly drunken hookups.USA TODAYReal women real issues abound this summerOn an assignment she meets a quiet ridiculously nice and very dateable sports doctor (Bill Hader) whos totally not her type -- while he might be kinda-sorta famous Aaron rocks out to Billy Joels Uptown Girl when operating and is a big fan of cuddling. So uncool yet she finds herself falling for him anyway a strange feeling that gives the committed bachelorette the heebie-jeebies.With cool-girl charm Schumer really makes the movie her own. Her standup material and TV series (Inside Amy Schumer) have tended toward over-the-top and political correctness be damned yet her Trainwreck screenplay is chock-full of emotion and depth as well as skewering humor and gut-busting one-liners. She also proves her worth as an actress tackling both physical comedy and full-on heartache with aplomb.USA TODAYWWEs John Cena dishes on living on the edge - in HollywoodSome of the best performances actually come from the non-thespians. Pro wrestler John Cena is great as Amys hypermuscular boyfriend who confuses sports quotes with dirty talk in a memorably awkward sex scene and famous hoopster LeBron James is a slam dunk as an overly frugal Downton Abbey-adoring version of himself. James is Aarons best friend and the person most looking out for his love life a twist on the tired rom-com formula -- imagine an insanely tall Judy Greer.With films such as Funny People and This Is 40 Apatow has toyed with finding the right blend of the serious and the hilarious and finally hits it here. Whether you end up liking Amy or not you feel for her on her journey and thats a testament to the director/star chemistry.Theres a lot thrown in here for two hours and Apatow could easily have lost about 30 minutes of high jinks and gotten the point across that everybody has their somebody. Yet with Schumer driving the action Trainwreck may be his most impactful ride yet. 723 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1J267eV,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/07/16/trainwreck-movie-review/30200051/,200,trainwreck32,trainwreck,usatoday

By Preston Jonespjonesdfw.comPosted 1123am on Thursday Jul. 16 2015 Thursday Jul. 16 2015 Wednesday Jul. 15 2015 By Preston Jones Fort Worth Star-Telegram Trainwreck is anything but.By giving her raunchy romantic comedy something so many genre entries lack -- a vivacious relatable personality -- star and screenwriter Amy Schumer makes a memorable cinematic debut deftly transitioning from her acclaimed zeitgeist-dominating Comedy Central TV series to the silver screen.Schumer stars as Amy Townsend a magazine writer whose social life could charitably be described as chaotic. Fond of drinking to excess and embarking on a series of sloppy one-night stands slipping out as soon as she possibly can -- all this despite a wobbly relationship with Steven (a woefully miscast John Cena) -- Amy is barely holding it together. Its only when Amy takes a chance assignment from her domineering editor Dianna (a glammed-up Tilda Swinton) reporting a story on sports doctor Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) that she finds herself in unfamiliar (read stable) territory. Trainwreck is a tart blend of frank sexuality and domestic drama giving audiences something they rarely see at the movies a woman unapologetic about wanting sex. In a cultural moment where women and sexuality are a flash point -- whether its Bill Cosbys alleged indiscretions or the harrowing assault allegations of the Runaways Jackie Fuchs -- its striking to see Schumer create a character unapologetic about hooking up and moving on. Theres a sense of reclamation -- too often in Hollywood such a role is almost exclusively male -- particularly since Amy isnt shunned or chastised by any of her friends or family. Her behavior however reckless or selfish is simply considered part of who she is. But Schumer also takes care to round out this self-described ""broken"" person as someone whose family dynamics are particularly fraught Amys sister Kim (Brie Larson) butts heads with her over the care of their multiple-sclerosis-afflicted father Gordon (a terrific Colin Quinn).Despite its sharper moments Trainwreck does follow the well-worn rom-com formula complete with splashy climax involving a dance routine inside Madison Square Garden set to Billy Joels Uptown Girl. Even so the sap has a distinct bite to it. Trainwreck is directed by Judd Apatow who has guided several funny females into high profile projects over the last decade (he oversaw the smash hit Bridesmaids directed Katherine Heigl in Knocked Up and helped Lena Dunham launch the HBO series Girls among others).His is an invisible hand here -- although Trainwreck like so many Apatow films could stand to lose 15-20 minutes from its run time -- allowing Schumers sensitive yet searingly funny work take center stage. Schumers performance is laudable and even moving at times and shes well matched with Hader who brings gentle warmth to his mostly straight-man role. Trainwreck is populated with a host of funny faces and surprise cameos -- Tony Romo turns up and Saturday Night Lives Leslie Jones gets a gut-busting moment late in the film -- but none are as surprising or as funny as basketball superstar LeBron James. (Yes you read that sentence correctly.) James displays a heretofore hidden knack for comedy easily slipping into the role of Dr. Conners best friend a man as eager to watch the latest episode of Downton Abbey as he is to dunk a basketball.Schumer and her collaborators are telling a very familiar tale with Trainwreck but its the way she approaches such tired material that makes this funny filthy film stand apart.

Starring Amy Schumer Bill Hader Brie Larson Colin Quinn LeBron James and Tilda Swinton. Opens everywhere. The title may imply disaster but ""Trainwreck"" is anything but. This raunchy rom-com is a high-speed rail line transporting director Judd Apatow back into relevance and writer/star Amy Schumer to the top of the A-list. Like previous Apatow productions this is a movie all about a lovable slob who learns to grow up with the help of a cast of colorful characters. But Schumer raises Apatows game beautifully. Her biting pitch-black wit and his penchant for character-driven comedy go together like gin and tonic. Schumer plays Amy a magazine writer who spends her days working on tacky articles and her nights boozing it up and sleeping around. Her well-adjusted sister (Brie Larson) is always on her case. Her eccentric editor (Tilda Swinton) wont stop dangling a promotion in front of her. Amy Schumer shifts from standup artist to movie star in ""Trainwreck."" (Photo Credit Mary Cybulski) Then shes assigned a feature about a respected sports doctor (Bill Hader). They fall in love. A relationship ensues. It gets very real and it gets very funny -- and the chemistry between Schumer and Hader is spellbinding. Schumer best known for her standup comedy and her television sketch show reveals herself to be a tremendous and well-rounded actress comfortable taking pratfalls and delivering tearful monologues. Hader is as effortlessly good as ever finally given the leading man role hes earned. These two comic heavyweights form the heart of the movie but they have strong support. LeBron James and professional wrestler John Cena make a strong case for being cast in more comedies. The deep bench of the supporting cast includes Mike Birbiglia Vanessa Bayer and even Method Man. Amy Schumer and Bill Haders relationship is the heart of ""Trainwreck."" (Universal) Bill Hader tries to muscle LeBron James in the paint in ""Trainwreck."" (Mary Cybulski) Amy Schumer and LeBron James in ""Trainwreck"" (Mary Cybulski) ""Trainwreck"" is rarely as laugh-out-loud funny as early Apatow or ""Inside Amy Schumer"" but it is consistently amusing and constantly engaging. Schumers script is a natural extension of the voice shes honed on stage and on TV. She gets raw revealing the truth and pain that power her comedy. Apatow is smart enough to let Schumers voice drive the film but this unmistakable blend of sweet and sour of melodrama and raunch is all him -- the good Apatow of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" not the lesser Apatow of ""This Is 40."" Alas the authentic and personal ""Trainwreck"" ultimately embraces formulaic romantic comedy in a third act that belongs in a 1990s movie starring Julia Roberts But by that point it doesnt matter. Apatow has redeemed himself. Schumer is a star. ""Trainwreck"" is the best comedy of the summer.

Sign up for our Newsletters. Daily Edition Login to download Trainwreck Film Review 437 AM PDT 3/16/2015 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS An extremely funny screenwriting debut with a very personal voice TWITTER Amy Schumer plays a woman whos nearly ready to give up her ramblin ways for Bill Hader. Cutting through many of the easy signifiers found in bad-behavior comedies to get at what it actually feels like to be an intimacy-phobic mess Trainwreck finds Judd Apatow putting his directing chops in service of Amy Schumers deeply felt but cracklingly funny screenplay. Starring as a woman with lets say a well-diversified love life who is disturbed to find herself spending more than one evening with the same man Schumer is more than credible in the kind of role usually associated with men making fun of her characters distrust of love while showing how honestly she comes by it. It will be interesting to see how this picture fares commercially compared to Apatows tales of similarly stunted young men Its in the same league in terms of laughs its romance works as well or better and theres less fat on it than Apatow sometimes allows. What could keep it from being a hit aside from double standards Americans apply to the sex lives of men and women? Schumers character also named Amy is a child of divorce whose father (Colin Quinn) taught her at an early age that ""monogamy isnt realistic."" While her sister Kim (Brie Larson) outgrew that lesson marrying a man who had a precocious kid from a previous relationship Amy took it to heart going home with all comers and generally staying sober enough to flee long before dawn. (If you blacked out and had to make the walk of shame back to Manhattan with commuters on the Staten Island Ferry you might do the same.) Amy is more than fine with this lifestyle and her workplace enables her callousness. Shes a writer for a douchey mag called SNUFF where a typical headline reads ""You Call These Tits?"" (A transformed Tilda Swinton who looks like shes been sandblasted and dipped in preservative chemicals is frighteningly effective as her soulless editor.) Assigned to do a feature on Aaron (Bill Hader) a surgeon who specializes in rebuilding injured athletes the sports-averse Amy is wary. But he interviews her more than vice versa in their first encounter and before long their conversations are happening over dinner then drinks then in a shared cab where Amy startles Aaron by telling the cabbie theyll be making not two stops but one. After that first night were in a rom-com where the roles are reversed Amy puzzles over her desire to see Aaron again while he gets support from a best pal whos thrilled to see he has finally met someone. (That best pal is LeBron James one of a few celebs who continue the Apatow tradition of working famous nonactors into the cast. Fortunately James is charming in the part a penny-pinching Downton Abbey fan who is protective of Aarons emotions.) Amys more pessimistic side is explored in scenes with her dad who has multiple sclerosis and must live in an assisted care facility. (Centenarian Norman Lloyd whose screen credits stretch back to Alfred Hitchcocks Saboteur in 1942 plays his most interesting neighbor.) Disagreements with Kim about Dads care are a window into Amys attitude toward the deeply flawed man and the way he helped shape the mess she became. While one scene on this front effortlessly becomes an eloquent tearjerker Schumers script conveys the storys psychological cause-and-effect without needing to express it in cliched dialogue. Shes much too busy squeezing in jokes and double entendres to waste words on that kind of thing. Hader is mostly straight man here radiating decency and patience even when Amy starts stumbling in their new relationship. Aaron is the kind of boyfriend with whom an I-need-to-be-angry woman really needs to get creative ""You go down on me too much"" she yells grasping at straws before warning him in a panic ""Dont try to spin this into a reason for not going down on me."" Schumer has never had anything like a leading film role but self-revealing stand-up and a TV series have limbered her up for the job. If she doesnt have quite the range of some other nascent stars Apatow has worked with her writing makes up for it and shes comfortable enough with the directors trademark improvisation that Trainwreck plays as if it were fully scripted. Structurally this is one romance whose brief period of crisis emerges less from a need to generate false drama than from insight into a woman who has practiced being a bad girl for so long she cant believe shed be good for someone. And when that crisis resolves were treated to one of the most surprising and charming dance numbers since Napoleon Dynamite. Heres hoping Schumer goes back to this well as quickly as Woody Allen an influence she cheekily acknowledges in a midfilm montage.

"Trainwreck review Amy Schumer keeps the laughs rolling - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Trainwreck review Amy Schumer keeps the laughs rolling Trainwreck Mary Cybulski Amy played by Amy Schumer on a date with Aaron played by Bill Hader in ""Trainwreck"" the new comedy from director/producer Judd Apatow. Amy played by Amy Schumer on a date with Aaron played by Bill Hader in ""Trainwreck"" the new comedy from director/producer Judd Apatow. (Mary Cybulski) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Like every Judd Apatow movie Trainwreck is too long. But Amy Schumers big-screen showcase is really funny. If youve seen ""Spy"" with Melissa McCarthy youre already aware that the movie nails its first big laugh -- the sneezing-assassin joke -- within moments of the opening credits. Even if you know its coming the timing is just right. And right away you think There. Thank you. These people know what theyre doing.How often does that thought run through your mind in a mainstream commercial comedy? Not often enough. It didnt happen with ""Ted 2"" which may be a moderate box-office success but its a weak vaguely smelly sequel. I bring up these movies in order to give ""Trainwreck"" written by and starring Amy Schumer its full brash often riotous due.At the risk of raising expectations the first few scenes are among the best director Judd Apatow has ever done in or out of the ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""/""Knocked Up"" universe of arrested-development guydom. ""Trainwreck"" hails from the universe next door arrested-development female division. Schumer plays a fictionalized variation on herself also named Amy or more accurately a variation on the stand-up and ""Inside Amy Schumer"" Comedy Central personae that have carried Schumer to her current showbiz location. The opening flashback sequence features Colin Quinn explaining to his two preteen daughters the futility and frustration of monogamy. Her childhood established in quick deft expositional strokes -- divorced parents; deceased mother; unrepentant horndog father afflicted with multiple sclerosis -- we travel forward with Schumers Amy to the present. Her zesty boozy emotionally guarded love life includes more sex than love but she doesnt mind. Does she?At any rate she does not like her men to sleep over. (In one stand-up routine Schumer joked that she slept in the position of a swastika requiring the entire bed.) Our guide to Manhattan romance writes for a sub-Cosmo magazine called ""SNuff"" edited by a ferociously egocentric boss played by a barely recognizable Tilda Swinton. The plot of ""Trainwreck"" is simple. Amys assigned to profile a successful Manhattan sports medicine specialist Aaron played by Bill Hader. One abrupt but highly promising sleepover later Aarons convinced they should date. Amy resists. The movie cooks up some conflict to divide these lovers for a while around the two-thirds point before Amy reckons with her more destructive and immature instincts. Trainwreck (Clip) ""Trainwreck"" Clip LeBron Talks To Aaron (ScreenPlay) ""Trainwreck"" Clip LeBron Talks To Aaron (ScreenPlay) See more videos The movie wouldnt be much fun without them of course. ""Trainwreck"" is all kinds of funny and like any talent showcase worth its salt the tone of the humor adjusts to suit the talents on screen. Early on theres a bit where Amy falls asleep immediately after a drunken orgasm and its pricelessly managed. Aarons friend and confidant is LeBron James portraying a penny-pinching ""Downton Abbey"" version of himself. When these two have a heart-to-heart on the basketball court it comes during the most lopsided game of one-on-one in history.Brie Larson plays Amys married sister whose agreeable low hum of a marriage (Mike Birbiglia plays her sweet husband) is everything Amy rejects. The sister relationship feels plausible and lived-in. So does the match of Schumer and Hader both of whom take the opportunity afforded by ""Trainwreck"" to do the subtlest work of their careers. Amy Schumer on the horrible feeling of falling in love Nina Metz In ""Trainwreck"" Amy Schumer plays an amped-up version of -- well not quite herself but someone who shares a good many of her biographical details. She is both the movies star and screenwriter and at least some of the comedy draws from her own life. ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Bill Hader is her... In ""Trainwreck"" Amy Schumer plays an amped-up version of -- well not quite herself but someone who shares a good many of her biographical details. She is both the movies star and screenwriter and at least some of the comedy draws from her own life. ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Bill Hader is her... (Nina Metz) Apatow generally has trouble with his wrap-ups and the final third or so of ""Trainwreck"" feels longish and full of detours. Several scenes (Amys subway encounter with a hostile passenger; an intervention scene featuring sports announcer Marv Albert) were asking to be cut. The climactic hookup scene with Amy on the rebound with a magazine colleague comes from a different film entirely. (Chris Rocks ""Top Five"" had similar issues with its swings from dry observation to a meaner homophobic brand of slapstick.)The laughs in ""Trainwreck"" may come with an apology (the character describes herself as ""broken"") but you believe the characters transformation by romantic love chiefly because Schumer and Hader are wonderful together. Gender inequity in the world of comedy deserves all the overdue attention its getting and more. But there are matters of craft wit (no matter how crude the jokes) and timing that transcend chromosomes. In ""Trainwreck"" when Amy is about to vomit while watching a surgical procedure from behind a glass wall the bit is so carefully calibrated and so aptly filmed in long shot with precisely the right amount of fake puke you think These people know what theyre doing.Michael Phillips is a Tribune Newspapers critic.mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune""Trainwreck"" - 3.5 starsMPAA rating R (for strong sexual content nudity language and some drug use)Running time 202Opens Thursday evening Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Trainwreck Amy Schumer Reviews Judd Apatow Spy Melissa McCarthy Amy Schumers Trainwreck resets portrayal of female appetites on screen Ant-Man review A little hero and a lot to like Amy Schumer I dont try to be feminist.

Over and over again the punchlines come at her own expense--how she drinks too much sleeps around too much and doesnt conform to Hollywoods size 0 ideal. But its hard to tell whether she actually believes what shes saying or if its all an act a way of winning the audience over through self-deprecation. Thats a pretty tricky tightrope to walk but Schumer has managed to walk it with the skill and fearlessness of a Wallenda. Now shes parlaying her deliriously dirty postfeminist brand of feminism into a bid for movie stardom in Judd Apatows new comedy Trainwreck. If the gambit works (and the films so sharp and funny its impossible that it wont) the mind reels at how Schumer will deal with big-screen success in her shock-therapy stand-up act. After all how do you take a shiv to Hollywoods sexism and size 0 piggishness after youve become its latest darling? Thats probably a question for another day. So for now lets just say that Schumers star turn in Trainwreck (which she also wrote) is one of the freshest and filthiest coming-out parties in a while. Rather than toning down her prickly persona to conform to the studio cookie cutter she stays true to what makes her laugh. You get the sense that shes someone whod rather break than bend. Schumer plays Amy an irresponsible good-time gal who thanks to her caddish father (Colin Quinn) lives by a shared belief that ""monogamy isnt realistic."" Unlike her married and pregnant sister (Brie Larson) she fears romantic commitment the same way she fears last call. When Amys not hooking up with sketchy guys or tottering home in heels while shielding daylight from her bloodshot eyes she works as a writer at a mens magazine. Then one particularly hungover day her editor (Tilda Swinton channeling Meryl Streep channeling Anna Wintour) assigns her to profile a hotshot sports physician to the stars (Bill Hader). After a first date that leads to the bedroom (actually his couch) she discovers to her own shock and disbelief that shes found a good guy she actually likes--and who likes her back. Will she sabotage the relationship before it starts or finally grow up and pull herself out of her selfish soused rut? Trainwreck isnt so radical that it subverts the formulaically feel-good ending implied in its setup. Beneath all of his bad-boy shtick Apatows always been a pretty conventional moralist. But Schumer gives their raunchy rom-com enough of her signature spikiness to prevent it from ever feeling predictable. Shes created a decidedly new kind of screwball heroine--one who isnt ashamed of screwing or screwing up.

Tuesday July 14 2015 at 1240 p.m. By Stephanie Zacharek EXPAND Dont be a Hader. Universal Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The problem with clamoring for more woman-led comedies is that actual comedy may be the thing that ends up being left by the wayside. Tina Fey among others has railed against the boneheaded dictum that women cant be funny. (Try telling that to Gracie Allen or to the recently departed Anne Meara to name just two.) But in the current climate of watchfulness -- one in which every joke must be constructed and sealed drum-tight so as not to offend anyone at any time -- its not enough for a woman just to be funny. Women comics must also be spokespeople for feminism for all women for anyone who might be perceived as oppressed or marginalized in any way. When you look at it that way being funny is the unfunniest job in the world.Amy Schumer is making her way ably to the top of this shaky ladder. The subjects she tackles on her Comedy Central show Inside Amy Schumer are the antithesis of boys-club humor In one sketch shes a video-game newbie who takes the controls of a Call of Duty-like shooter from her boyfriend and stumbles into an all-too-realistic military rape scenario. Schumer can be lacerating. Shes also sometimes more likely to leave your jaw hanging open than to make you laugh which is one of the downsides of comedy thats crafted to make a point Theres often something lecture-y about it as if were being made to atone for years of laughing at plain old dumb stuff. Thats the price we pay when we wish -- as we all do -- for smart comedy and Trainwreck if nothing else strives to be smart.Film Details Trainwreck RatingR GenreComedy Running Time122 min. More Info Trailer Trainwreck is Schumers first starring movie role; she also wrote the script. And while the picture is occasionally very funny -- because when she lets loose Schumer does have a fantastic loosey-goosey wiliness -- it also feels carefully constructed to make its points chief among them that men can get away with all kinds of bad or crazy behavior that women cant. That by itself could be entertaining if the movie just ran with it. But theres a much bigger more insidious problem with Trainwreck Schumer may be the writer and star but Judd Apatow is the director and in the end you cant escape the feeling that somehow Schumers vision has been wrestled into the template that nearly all of his movies even the best ones follow one in which the comforts of conventional partnerships and family life are what we should all aspire to even though we may pretend to be interested in tawdry things like casual sex and excessive partying. Apatow and Schumer probably believe theyve made a feminist picture but the reality is something different. This is a conventional movie dressed as a progressive one.Related StoriesPodcast The Taming of Amy SchumerSchumer plays Amy a writer at a slick lads magazine in New York. (Tilda Swinton in a rare comic role is killer as the ruthless editor-in-chief -- shes like a lampreys mouth perched on long long legs.) Amy is determinedly uncommitted and noncommittal; her parents marital breakup years before led her to doubt whether monogamy is even possible. She favors one-night stands and has lots of them though there is one monosyllabic musclebound dude (John Cena) she sees more frequently than the rest -- somehow he believes theyre exclusive and is crestfallen to discover his mistake. The sequence in which he comes to this realization is played partly for laughs but we can see it makes Amy think as if shes getting an inkling that her cluelessness about the feelings of others might amount to a kind of cruelty.Apatow and Schumer probably believe theyve made a feminist picture.Amy also drinks too much and sometimes she wakes up uncertain how she found her way between any given set of sheets One particular bleary morning she opens her eyes and spotting a Scarface poster on the wall utters a quiet prayer ""Please dont be a dorm room."" Between assignations assorted life issues intervene Amy has to navigate an affectionate but sometimes strained relationship with her sister (Brie Larson) while the foul-mouthed racist father she adores (Colin Quinn) is in ill health and has had to go into assisted living. Amy could probably just keep sleeping with random guys forever but in the line of duty she meets a sweet successful super-nerdy orthopedic surgeon Bill Haders Aaron whos unlike anyone shes ever known. She falls for him irrationally and almost immediately. And because she doesnt see herself as the type who could settle down with just one person she proceeds to make his life miserable.The start of Trainwreck is promising. We think were getting a movie where a woman gets to enjoy the company of lots of partners without remorse or shame the sort of freedom men -- some of them at least -- have enjoyed for centuries. But the trouble signs show up early We have no idea why Amy is attracted to one guy or another even just for a night. Before she meets Aaron she doesnt even seem to enjoy the sex we see her having -- were simply supposed to assume she does because theres lots of it and because she favors really short skirts and low-cut blouses (not that she doesnt look good in them). Theres nothing sensuous about Amy. She tackles her sex life with grim determination and her lack of engagement -- emotional or sexual -- exposes a sneaky and unpleasant thread of conservatism in Trainwreck The movie wants us to buy the idea that sex really is best with your One True Love and anything outside that is just a cheap substitute.Meanwhile theres lots of lewd ribald humor -- some of it pretty effective -- to throw us off the trail of the movies squareness. There are jokes about bloody tampons floating unflushed and forlorn in the toilet bowl. There are gags about the ultra-relaxing powers of cunnilingus and about trying (in vain) to get a guy to talk dirty. Theres a montage of Amy and Aaron doing embarrassing kissy-face stuff all across Manhattan narrated by a mortified Amy in voiceover. Some of the actors too seem to belong in a much hipper movie. Hader is a charming leading man -- his goofy smile is vaguely reminiscent of Wallace Shawns and its sexy as hell a surprisingly potent secret weapon. LeBron James and Amare Stoudemire show up in small roles as themselves James in particular hams it up and has a blast -- hes a kick to watch.Schumer has the harder job shouldering the film and theres no doubt shes game. She looks like a cross between an angel on a Victorian greeting card and a Campbells Soup Kid an unholy alliance that promises the right kind of trouble. But her character in Trainwreck is at times so badly behaved -- toward a man she supposedly loves -- that its hard to be on her side. We shouldnt have to approve of characters behavior; in comedy especially its more fun if we dont. Still we have to be mostly sympathetic to Amy for the movie to work and if I were Aaron Id run a mile from her. That he bends over backward to accommodate her doesnt make her seem admirable or smart or modern or even just interesting Anyone man or woman can be an emotional bully. And in the end its supposed to be a triumph that Amy is won over to the wonders of monogamy.In the movies terms we know shell never miss any of those other guys because she never had much invested in them anyway. Trainwreck pretends to be frank about sex from a womans point of view yet it refuses to reckon with how ferocious and unmanageable sex really is. A retreat into the safety of couplehood is the only possible future it can imagine the necessary corrective to sleeping around. In its too-tidy universe good girls dont. And bad girls probably shouldnt either.Trainwreck Directed by Judd Apatow Universal Pictures Opens July 17 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

She has a drinking problem. A drugging problem. And as for her dating situation -- well her current relationship is with a very twisted wrestler with an anger problem. Whom shes cheating on. Thats Amy Townsend by the way not Amy Schumer -- but its easy to get the two confused. Schumer has quickly built a career out of kinda-but-not-really confessions about her vices. (She even used to date a wrestler -- although hopefully a nicer one than this guy.) And in ""Trainwreck"" she digs into that persona again playing a familiarly dirty flirty screwup. And Schumers pretty wonderful and the movie -- in a summer that was still waiting for its R-rated smash -- is great fun. In some ways its a gender-switched version of director Judd Apatows ""Knocked Up."" That movie was about Seth Rogen turning responsible after a fateful hookup with Katherine Heigl; this one is about commitment-phobe Schumer getting serious about nice guy Bill Hader. Both films were about likable slobs thinking Im not ready for this. And us telling them yes you are dope. Grab it. The script (which Schumer wrote) has fun turning cliches inside out too. In this movie its the women who treat the morning-after call from a date as a weird pushy intrusion; its the men who carefully parse every syllable to see if she really really liked them. Bill Hader is dependable fun as Schumers dream-date doctor and this film has a wonderfully eclectic supporting cast from a very funny John Cena (who knew?) and nicely relaxed LeBron James to a sweetly tender Brie Larson and hysterically grumpy Colin Quinn. (And yes that is Tilda Swinton under that wig as Schumers Ab-Fab-style editor and shes simply gorge sweetie baby simply.) But this is really Schumers chance to shine and she seizes it. Deserves it too. Most of our comedy stars are standups-turned-actors; in movies they deliver a line and then freeze waiting for the laugh their timing off. But Schumer began with years of serious theater training; she knows the difference between a routine and a scene and some of her work -- particularly in a teary salute to her father -- is terrific. True ""Trainwreck"" would be even better if it dared more. But while I preferred Apatows last two films ""This is 40"" and ""Funny People"" millions didnt so hes back in a safer spot here no longer confronting the world of mid-life crises. (Hes still a sloppy filmmaker though; twice in the film in multi-character scenes some closeups are consistently slightly grainy - a clue that some desperate last-minute work may have been done in the editing room.) And Schumer -- whose own TV show is both more disciplined and riskier than this - is clearly trying to go a little more mainstream as well. While theres a movie-parody of an indie film that eats up time without delivering any jokes theres little of the very pointed feminist humor that marks her series. (In fact the movie even ends on a fairly unliberated note - Amy tamed and turned into her guys fantasy). But even if this is a movie aimed squarely at the ""Superbad"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" territory thats a pretty hilarious area to revisit and even if its not as gleefully provocative as Schumers TV show just casting her in a picture like this as a character like this is a breakthrough. And almost guaranteed to be a deserved breakout hit. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations nudity strong language substance abuse and brief violence. Trainwreck (R) Universal (122 min.)

By Anthony Lane Amy Schumer and Bill Hader in a new movie directed by Judd Apatow.   Credit Illustration by David Saracino Near the start of ""Trainwreck"" Amy Townsend played by Amy Schumer lies in bed and watches a man undress. He has to stand there the poor sap until she has finished telling jokes about his genitals. The two of them get down to business which is concluded when she falls asleep. She begins to snore and the moral is When it comes to guys and dolls a doll can be just like a guy and be none the worse for it. That is her right and it brooks no contradiction. Or as Amy herself puts it in voice-over ""Dont judge me fuckers."" Your response to ""Trainwreck"" which was written by Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow will depend on how you read that line. Is it robust and plain-speaking proud of its comic swagger or is there something tight-mouthed in its imperative with a hint of ""or else"" hanging off the end? Either way the life of Amy is dished up for our inspection. She is a serial boozer and as if to highlight the fact most of the wine she drinks is of a nasty urinous hue. (Also thanks to a tic of her natural speech invaluable for her onscreen persona Schumer sounds drunk even when shes not.) Amy lives alone in New York making out whenever she pleases and declaring of her conquests ""Never ever let them sleep over."" She does sleep over one night and is mortified at waking up on Staten Island and tottering home in a tiny gold skirt and scarlet heels. There is also a boyfriend of sorts a slab of gym-toughened meat named Steven (John Cena) whose idea of dirty talk is to exclaim ""Let me fill you with my protein"" but Amy wouldnt dream of staying true to him. One thing we can state for sure is that this woman cannot and will not fall in love. Youll never guess what happens. Amy is a writer for SNuff magazine where the staff pitches articles like ""Ugliest Celebrity Kids Under Six"" and ""Youre Not Gay Shes Boring."" Despite her belief that ""sports are stupid"" and that there are teams out there called the Cincinnati Thunder Wizards and the Orlando Blooms Amy is assigned by her editor--a formidable turn by Tilda Swinton encased in a sweeping wig and a fortress of makeup--to profile Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) a surgeon who specializes in sports injury. (Hence the yucky image of a knee sliced open to the bone; hence too the shoal of celebrities milling about for no reason. LeBron James has some easygoing chats with Aaron but once Chris Evert Marv Albert and Amare Stoudemire show up the namechecks become an embarrassment.) Needless to say Amy seduces Aaron whereupon--horrors--he calls her and asks for a date. It turns out that he is not just a sweetheart but a do-gooder earning awards from Doctors Without Borders and the scene in which he is praised for ""changing the world"" is the point at which ""Trainwreck"" mislays its sense of irony. ""Whats wrong with you that you would want to go out with me?"" Amy asks him and the movie answers its own question arguing that (a) there is nothing wrong with Aaron and ergo that (b) she is O.K. too just a lost soul in need of a loving home. You can almost hear her plea ""Be sorry for me fuckers."" Are there any modern comedies that hold their nerve and pursue their radical options to a bitter end? More than eighty years ago the censor Joseph Breen was so appalled by the carnal candor of Barbara Stanwyck in ""Baby Face"" that he strong-armed Warner Bros. into cleaning up the ending and teaching the heroine a lesson but Breen would not be needed these days. Though a movie like ""Trainwreck"" sounds filthy enough it cleans itself up as it goes along--setting off at a rough lick yet soon displaying signs of moral decency. As in previous Apatow films the temptations of togetherness eventually drown the siren call of the boudoir. Amy though informed by Steven ""Youre not nice"" is nice enough to befriend a homeless man outside her apartment; her philandering is not that of a genuine free spirit but of a conscience wrenched out of joint by an equally faithless father (Colin Quinn) who now as if paying for his sins suffers from multiple sclerosis and resides in an assisted-living facility. Amy has a sister (Brie Larson) who has a husband and a stepson and fiercely though Amy mocks their domestic harmony they have much to teach her the end result being a long shot late in the proceedings of all four of them gathered for a group hug. And that as it were is Amys final instruction ""Be happy for me fuckers."" So much for the promise of the title. ""Trainwreck"" sticks to the rails. The new Bill Condon film ""Mr. Holmes"" finds Sherlock Holmes (Ian McKellen) in the dusk of his life. The year is 1947 and he is ninety-three long since retired to the south coast of England. The sea where he bathes is reached across soft pastures. Attended by a housekeeper (Laura Linney) and her young son Roger (Milo Parker) Holmes devotes himself largely to beekeeping. More and more he is stung by lapses of memory each of them marked in his diary with a rueful dot and he recently travelled to Japan in search of a rare plant with rejuvenating powers. You can understand his fear. Were he no longer in his right mind he would not be Holmes at all. One case from his past is a cause of particular vexation. Thirty years ago a woman named Ann Kelmot (Hattie Morahan) was reported by her husband to be straying--whether into mischief madness or illicit love was not yet clear. Holmes assigned to help followed Ann spoke to her and brought light to the mystery and murk yet the outcome was far from satisfactory. ""I must have done something terribly wrong"" he tells himself. The movie makes a big deal of this but Sherlockians will hardly be surprised since on the page wrongness and regret flickered around his exploits from the start. There were many occasions on which he arrived too late to prevent an unfortunate death. ""Mr. Holmes"" is a curious beast. It has three time frames not just 1947 and the Kelmot affair but also a flashback to Japan where Holmess guide (Hiroyuki Sanada) discovers the precious plant in the ruins of Hiroshima no less. This intrusion of the brutally real has been tried before first by Arthur Conan Doyle himself who set ""His Last Bow"" on the brink of the First World War and then by films like ""Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon"" (1943) in which Moriarty had to be stopped from selling military hardware to the Nazis. The difference is that Basil Rathbones Holmes was an ageless being to be spirited through time without a wrinkle whereas McKellen--dapper in his top hat circa 1917 then riven and slowed by the ensuing years--is nothing if not mortal. The conceit on which the movie rests is that Holmes was a real person who walked the earth and that his adventures were transcribed by Watson who as Holmes says ""made me into a fiction"" tweaking a few details along the way. (His actual address was changed to 221B Baker Street ""to mislead the curious."") As for Conan Doyle he vanishes into air. In short there is plenty here for postmodernists. They will squeak with joy at the sight of Holmes entering a cinema and watching an actor play ""Sherlock Holmes"" in a hokey black-and-white movie that never existed. (Another twist the actor is played by Nicholas Rowe who took the title role in ""Young Sherlock Holmes and the Pyramid of Fear"" thirty years ago.) To what end however has this cleverness been brewed? When Holmes collapses dropping a glass paperweight to the floor does the wink to ""Citizen Kane"" mean that we are trapped in a Wellesian quest for identity? Not really. The atmosphere that enfolds ""Mr. Holmes"" could not be more sedate. It belongs to what a friend of mine calls the toot-toot genre which includes any period film or TV drama that starts with a shot of a steam train. The music betrays not a flutter of anxiety and most of the backdrops pacify the eye preferring pastoral quietude to those dim London streets strangled in fog that proved so vivifying to Holmes in his prime. As for the central puzzle it falls to pieces in your hands. Condon prepares us well strewing the screen with closeups as if to demonstrate how an object under the heros gaze is transfigured into a clue and yet the secret of Ann Kelmot once revealed makes no practical sense. In truth ""Mr. Holmes"" is not Holmesian at all. It is Jamesian as shown by a wonderful encounter between Kelmot and Holmes--an attraction of opposites you might say--on a garden bench. McKellen is peremptory and sleek whereas Morahan (whose Nora in ""A Dolls House"" made such an impression at bam last year) is clothed in dove gray and emotionally aflame. Ann reaches out to Holmes for solace and he offers her logic in return. Likewise when young Roger is hurt Holmess instinct is to summon medical aid before informing the housekeeper. ""Im his mother"" she howls. The movie reproaches him for that chill and indeed he reproaches himself but who wants a warmhearted Holmes? He is not a counsellor but a huntsman and without him who would lead the chase?  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

"Trainwreck Review Amy Schumer Shines Judd Apatow Bounces Back | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews SXSW Film Review Trainwreck Scott Foundas Chief Film Critic foundasonfilm 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Image courtesy of Universal March 16 2015 | 0700AM PT Amy Schumer and Judd Apatow craft a winning portrait of a good-time Sally in the grip of her first serious relationship. ""Monogamy isnt realistic"" says a soon-to-be-divorced dad to his two preteen daughters in an early scene from Judd Apatows ""Trainwreck."" Two decades later those words have taken their toll on one of those erstwhile little girls -- a tart-tongued booze-swilling serial dater (writer-star Amy Schumer) whose love life is barreling downhill with ever-increasing velocity. Shes the screwed-up screwball heroine at the center of a somewhat shaggy frequently hilarious romantic comedy that like much of Apatows best work delicately balances irreverent raunch with candid insights into the give-and-take of grown-up relationships. The change in scenery (New York from Los Angeles) and gender emphases serves Apatow well as does Schumers excitingly original comic voice which should spell a critical and commercial rebound for the comedy impresario following the mixed fortunes of his more sober semi-autobiographical ""Funny People"" and ""This Is 40."" The Universal release opens wide July 17 following its ""work-in-progress"" premiere at SXSW. The persistent accusation that Apatow underserves his female characters has never really held water given the smart complex women played by Catherine Keener in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and by Leslie Mann (the real-life Mrs. Apatow) in ""Funny People"" and ""This Is 40."" Still ""Trainwreck"" is the first of Apatows five directorial features to focus on a female lead -- and one with enough unbridled life force for a dozen ordinary characters. Schumer a relative newcomer whose career up to now has mostly been in television has written herself a gem of a role here -- one that allows her to show the full range of her comic gifts while doing a lot to subvert the ossified codes that dictate how women in Hollywood romantic comedies are supposed to behave. Whereas even the supposedly liberated protagonists of Nancy Meyers and the late Nora Ephron still mostly define themselves by the presence (or absence) of Mr. Right in their lives Schumers Amy Townsend has long ago sworn off such aspirations (if she ever had them) looks upon her happily married sister (Brie Larson) the way a child looks at brussels sprouts and uses men as disposably as the playboy-lothario heartbreakers in such movies tend to use women. Amy makes the first move and also the last rarely spending the night and almost never returning for a second date -- save for her semi-steady FWB a musclebound lunkhead (a very game John Cena) who approaches sex as if it were a grueling CrossFit routine. Amy is in many ways a chip off the old block the daughter of a cantankerous alcoholic dad (Colin Quinn) who was never really there for his girls (or their mother) and whos now suffering from the advanced stages of MS. The cost of Dads assisted-living care becomes a running bone of contention for the sisters and one of the ways Apatow (whos always been attentive to matters of class and money) and Schumer maintain a baseline of real-world problems even as the plot begins to tilt in the direction of Tracy and Hepburn. That shift occurs when Amy a staff writer for a crass Maxim-esque mens magazine gets assigned a profile of Aaron Conners (Bill Hader) a rising star among sports-medicine doctors whose patients include LeBron James and Amare Stoudemire. In a device thats as old as 1934s ""It Happened One Night"" (one of several classic comedies including ""Manhattan"" to which ""Trainwreck"" tips its hat) and as recent as last years ""Top Five"" journalist and subject soon find themselves throwing ethics to the wind and their bodies into each others arms. Which in the case of ""Trainwreck"" isnt the end of the story but merely the point where things start to get complicated. Schumer and Hader (fresh off his breakout dramatic turn in last years ""The Skeleton Twins"") are terrifically appealing together in part because they arent cut from the standard movie-romance cloth and because Schumer doesnt give them standard movie-romance obstacles to overcome. There are no rival lovers here who must be jilted en route to the altar but realer trickier matters at hand like Amys lifetime of dating men who failed to stir any deeper feelings in her and Aarons gradual realization of what it really means to share your life with someone for better and for worse. Doubtless such sentiments will earn Apatow yet more accusations of being a closeted family-values pundit but as the filmmaker himself has said repeatedly Yes as a child of divorce himself hes a believer in marriage or at least monogamy however unrealistic that may be. Like Apatow Schumer writes in a deeply personal vein and favors the kind of narrative detours and digressions that dont necessarily further the plot (and which push the running time past the two-hour mark) but which enlarge our sense of the characters and the world they inhabit. In ""Trainwreck"" that means considerable time spent fleshing out the staff of Snuff magazine where Amy competes against her colleagues (Randall Park Vanessa Bayer) for the favor of their castrating Anna Wintour-ish boss (a hilarious Tilda Swinton almost unrecognizable beneath pounds of bronze foundation and turquoise eyeshadow). Aarons workplace is considerably less cutthroat despite all the literal bone and sinew but it allows him time to play a little one-on-one with King James (a good sight gag) and to ponder Amys gale-force impact on his life. Beat for beat this is one of Apatows most consistently funny and charming films right up to one of those extravagant displays of a characters affections that would seem terribly corny if it werent so heartfelt. Its also Apatows most cinematic work with softly lit widescreen cinematography (on 35mm film stock) from d.p. Jody Lee Lipes (""Tiny Furniture"" ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"") and the surest sense of framing camera placement and editing the director has yet demonstrated free of the vestiges of sitcom television and its insistence on ""punching in"" for the joke. In addition to James and Stoudemire Apatow and Schumer have recruited a host of other sports-world figures (including Dallas Cowboys QB Tony Romo and former tennis champ Chris Evert) for self-effacing cameos but the biggest surprise is indeed James who plays himself -- or rather a self-aggrandizing penny-pinching version of himself -- to deadpan perfection. Also deftly stealing a few scenes with the aplomb of a far younger man is the 100-year-old theater film and television legend Norman Lloyd cast as a fellow resident of Quinns elder-care retreat.
