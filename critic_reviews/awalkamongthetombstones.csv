Liam Neeson even walks among them. Other people do too and there may or may not be a pivotal action sequence that takes place at said cemetery most definitely among tombstones with plenty of shooting and running to go alongside the walking (okay there definitely is one). The title of the latest ""hey Liam Neeson is good at killing people"" feature may be surprisingly straightforward but the films content is genuinely unexpected Liam Neeson is good at killing people but yeah he can totally follow investigatory procedure before he does it. ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" isnt ""Taken"" or even ""Taken 2"" or ""Non-Stop"" Neesons Matt Scudder doesnt have anything personal on the line hes just an unlicensed private investigator with a slightly muddled police officer past who occasionally does ""favors"" for ""friends"" for ""gifts."" If you need something taken care of that for whatever reason cant involve the authorities Scudder is your guy. Hes good at it hes dependable and hes got enough of a moral code to set himself apart from the rest the scum out there. The crimes at the heart of ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" are particularly trying hard heinous stuff - the films opening credits stealthily and steadily let on whats ahead of us featuring close shots of a woman in apparent ecstasy being touched and caressed by what looks to be a caring lover. Except oops shes a captive and there are two guys touching her and no no none of this is caring and loving and yes its okay to feel a bit queasy. Turns out shes not the only one and Scudders services are soon requested by the smooth-talking Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens) the brother of Scudders AA pal Peter (Boyd Holbrook doing a lot with a little) who has lost his wife to the same creeps who molested the ill-fated star of the opening credits. Scudder is initially reticent to take on the case - Kenny is a drug dealer and even though Scudder deals with people who arent necessarily on the up-and-up at all times hes got enough sense to stay away from this one. Until well he just cant thanks to a teary Kenny who begs Scudder to take the case punctuating his plea with the gory details some dudes took his wife they asked for a hefty ransom he paid it they killed her anyway. Mrs. Kristo isnt the first victim of the two perps (David Harbour and Adam David Thompson who are revealed early enough the question of ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is never really ""who"" but more ""why"" and ""how"") and Scudder sets about finding the connective tissue between their victims in order to properly ID them and stop them before they kill again. Oh and theyre ready to kill again. Set in 1999 ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is riddled with references to Y2K and all the outsized fears that came with that. Based on Lawrence Blocks novel of the same name the film is preoccupied with people fearing the wrong thing - at one point one character even mutters ""people are afraid of all the wrong things."" A latent fear of someone kidnapping and murdering your loved ones because youre a drug dealer might not be a common fear (or really a reasonable one) but Frank sells it and ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is scary and unnerving in the best ways. Scudder has secrets like why he left the force and why he stopped drinking and why he doesnt have a wife and most of those answers are dutifully doled out throughout the course of the film if not narratively original at least necessary enough to be included. Franks screenplay occasionally hedges to obvious narrative movements most of which he unexpectedly subverts at the last minute. Even the inclusion of a young fun sidekick (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) feels fresh and Bradleys TJ is compelling and interesting on his own (alongside Neeson its nearly magic someone give these two a sequel ASAP). Even better the film has a tidy sense of humor about itself and its heavy stuff is often punctuated by gut-busting giggles (Scudder in the presence of a possible perp says without a lick of irony ""Youre a weirdo Jonas"" but we still know that he and Frank are going for laughs here and does it ever work). Still Franks film is much more of a noir outing than a straight action feature and Neeson slips right into the tone and feel of the hard-boiled detective offering. Neeson may have been treated to a big career resurgence thanks to his knack for big action but hes great as Matt Scudder and the darker charms of the film suit him wonderfully.

The change might have been lamentable if not for the fact that in the half dozen genre films hes toplined since 2009--Unknown The Grey Non-Stop among them--he has each time elevated the janky material with his stalwart workmanlike commitment. In the latest case A Walk Among the Tombstones he plays gruff Brooklyn private eye Matt Scudder (the bullet-holed hero of Lawrence Blocks popular book series) here tasked with hunting down a pair of deviant kidnappers that used power tools on the wife of a drug dealer (Dan Stevens). No matter how ridiculous and ugly the story gets Neeson is an endlessly compelling presence--so gaunt-faced and haunted that for a moment in time its regrettable that he didnt portray Abraham Lincoln as originally planned. It hardly matters when his low growl of a voice switches from an Irish brogue to ""Was wonderin if I could tawk to ya?"" in the space of one sentence. Director Scott Frank the Out of Sight screenwriter whose first feature was 2007s moody noir The Lookout aspires to do something higher-brow with Blocks pulp novel. This backfires on the script level where a number of head-scratching social commentaries (including gun safety Alcoholics Anonymous and Sickle Cell Anemia) inappropriately elbow their way into a plot repellent enough to features a womans breast being sliced off by piano wire. But he has more artistic success with the movies visual style collaborating with the imaginative cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. (The Master) to create a darkly beautiful tilt-focused picture of wintry Brooklyn. The tombstones of the title refer to the ones in Greenwood Cemetery a New York attraction of magnificent landscape and design which is flaunted in its entire spooky cinematic splendor for one of the first times ever onscreen. Frank borrows from the best. A visual reference to the World Trade Center late in the film is an exact replica of Steven Spielbergs Munich finale and he also cribs from Martin Scorsese (GoodFellas) and David Fincher (Zodiac) when he uses a Donovan song as the soundtrack for florid violence. More original are his period preoccupations. Though Blocks book was published in 1992 Frank has adapted it so that it takes place in 1999 and he loads on the fifteen-year-old details video stores pay phones microfilm Y2K anxiety. The nostalgia is most evoked in the depiction of the sociopathic killers as a gay couple--a smutty tactic trotted out in 90s thrillers like Basic Instinct and rarely seen in movies nowadays. The relationship is too undercooked for anyone to accuse the movie of homophobia but the subplot almost works as a knowing wink from Frank who clearly has an eye on hoary devices of decades past. As a throwback to a type of nasty ugly crime film of yesteryear A Walk Among the Tombstones cleans up.

""Touch the one you want to keep"" he says referring to her breasts which hes exposed and poked and ogled. Seconds later we hear her scream as he takes a knife to her chest. That scene just about sums up whether youll want to watch writer-director Scott Franks lurid ultra-grim procedural. ""Tombstones"" distinguishes itself not by its familiar yet satisfyingly plotted whodunit but by its absorbingly macabre depiction of 1999 New York as a playground for cruel psychopaths who treat womens bodies like toddlers treat construction paper. See video Liam Neeson Displays More Killing Skills in A Walk Among the Tombstones Trailer The reluctant do-gooder trying to establish some law and order is unlicensed P.I. Matthew Scudder (Neeson) the protagonist of two dozen books by Lawrence Block. Neesons soulfulness is the only thing keeping this version of the former cop from falling into stereotype since on paper hes exactly the kind of anti-heroic brooder youd expect resourceful haunted seeking redemption. Costumed like a dusty extra from the Coen Brothers ""True Grit"" Scudder is consumed with just enough self-loathing after committing a gross misdeed years earlier to help drug trafficker Kenny (Dan Stevens ""Downton Abbey"") track down the kidnappers who abducted his wife killed her and desecrated her corpse for good measure. Low on psychology but high on pulp ""Tombstones"" tries to tap into some lizard part of the brain obsessed with calamity and doom. The killers inhuman viciousness -- and the fact that the one guy who can do something about their murder spree is routinely thrown around like a sack of potatoes -- is much scarier than the clumsy Y2K-anxious pre-9/11 imagery which portends that an even larger more elusive enemy will strike soon. As nauseating as the films inventive sadisms can be Frank succeeds far more in the details than in the larger picture that tries to relate this world to ours. Also read Liam Neeson Julie Bowen and Key amp; Peele Coming to Foxs Animated Block Fortunately then the latter half of the film focuses simply on plot after establishing mood as Scudder trudges around a pre-gentrified Brooklyn to find a trail toward the killers who careen between the robotically aloof and the clownishly grotesque. The game of cat-and-evil-mice grows to involve the abduction of the teenage daughter of another gangster. Her introduction in a fairy tale-like red hood while the killers leer to Donovans ""Atlantis"" comprise one of several erotically framed moments on which Frank then turns the table leaving viewers both turned on and creeped out. If Frank is trying to say something with that his message is unclear. It just left me wishing the girls and women in this world were allowed any other possibilities beyond kidnap and/or murder victims. See also Liam Neeson Would Reprise His Ras al Ghul Role on CWs Arrow In a Heartbeat (Video) In a film as somber and violent as this one a sense of humor is absolutely necessary. Were grateful then for the brief appearances of Scudders kiddie sidekick T.J. (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley of the upcoming ""Red Band Society"") the tech-savvy homeless teen who fills in for Scudders lack of computer skills. With his precocious verbiage and smack talk about women T.J. isnt too far removed from an 80s sitcom character -- and the relationship between him and the gumshoe begins to resemble something out of ""Diffrent Strokes."" But its hard not to pull for the character when hes the only bright spot in the darkness. The ""Tombstones"" world is so cheerless and bleak wed almost rather just spend an evening watching TV and ragging on Liam Neesons with him. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Neesons character here Matt Scudder is taken from a series of novels by Lawrence Block that date to the 70s but have inspired only one other movie of note (Jeff Bridges 1986 film Eight Million Ways To Die). Hes an ex-cop-turned private detective and recovering alcoholic. The latter gives us scenes in AA that are as close to character development as the movie gets. At one point in avenging-angel-with-a-gun mode he recites ""twelve step"" lines to himself with an impressive gravitas that brings to mind the old saw about actors reciting the phonebook. Which is the thing about Neesons current career. At 62 the man has such physical presence (he only recently gave up boxing as exercise) that he lifts the flimsiest action vehicles a notch above plain silly. And what amounts to drama is stuff he can play in his sleep. For mobile users click this link Essentially a find-the-psychopath procedural at the level of an episode of Criminal Minds A Walk Among the Tombstones finds Scudder hired by a distraught drug trafficker (Dan Stevens) whose wife was kidnapped and murdered even though the ransom was paid. Seems the perps are not so much motivated by money but by some twisted Dexter-like sadism directed at the innocent loved ones of ostensible bad guys. In the TV shows the good guys are usually aided by a trope ""computer hacker"" sidekick. In A Walk Among the Tombstones that role is filled by an implausible street kid (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) who hangs out in the library to keep his hands warm and connected online. Astro is the pubescent ""street"" rapper from last years season of Americas Got Talent who seems to have been snagged by Hollywood as the cute black kid with tude du jour (or half a jour). His role here closely follows his big-screen debut in the youth-oriented sci-fi movie Earth to Echo. Its a cliched oddball-partners-who-need-each-other setup predicated on the idea that Scudder is so old-school he has trouble using Google. Kind of a handicap for a detective in 2014. The irony is that in some Hollywood boardroom Astro was clearly cast to add ""cool"" and youth-cred to Neesons latest vigilante turn. In reality his presence drains the movie of same. What next? Snooki as Neesons leading lady? Director Scott Frank lights and paces the movies tensest moments effectively giving you the impression youre watching something noir. In fact youre watching something forgettable merely the latest packaging around the popular Liam Neeson action-figure.

Comments click to enlarge A Walk Among the Tombstones Video Rated R  114 minutes  2014 Liam Neeson is a private investigator trailing two sickos who prey on the wives of rich drug traffickers. Adapted from a novel by Lawrence Block this revenge thriller evokes Charles Bronson vehicles from the mid 1970s right down to the title. Its nasty cynical and heavy on the torture though writer-director Scott Frank working with the gifted cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. (The Master) achieves a thick foreboding atmosphere. As usual Neeson gives a more thoughtful performance than the material deserves. With Dan Stevens.

"Walk Among the Tombstones A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; walk-among-the-tombstones-a ) Walk Among the Tombstones A (United States 2014) September 19 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Nihilistic. Grim. Humorless. Misogynistic. Those are just a few words that could be used to describe Liam Neesons new thriller A Walk Among the Tombstones. The title provides more than a clue about the movies tone and intentions. Yet this isnt some run-of-the-mill over-the-top revenge flick in which the good guys triumph and the bad guys get their comeuppance. As written and directed by Scott Frank this is about the elusiveness (and perhaps illusion) of redemption. The white hats are stained dark gray as if by ashes and soot. The villains are twisted cruel and vile. The heroes arent much better. If this is your kind of movie its hard to find one better made. Frank whose previous screenwriting credits include Dead Again Get Shorty Minority Report and Out of Sight knows what hes doing. His direction elicits revulsion at the appropriate times and watching A Walk Among the Tombstones can be an uncomfortable and at times daunting experience. This isnt a rah-rah excursion in which viewers hoot and cheer as the good guy turns the tables on his enemies. This isnt another Taken. The screenplay is dour; there are no one-liners or attempts at comic relief unless you count the signs referencing the impending doom of Y2K (this tale transpires in 1999). The body count isnt high - just into the double-digits - but the ways in which women are brutalized and killed dont make for escapist fare. And thats before the violence turns in the direction of a 14-year old girl. But when you sign on for a movie about serial killers and the men who hunt them do you expect anything more upbeat? The Silence of the Lambs was brilliant but it was also harsh. Neeson plays Matt Scudder the protagonist of 17 novels penned by crime novelist Lawrence Block; this is a role that was essayed some 28 years ago by Jeff Bridges in 8 Million Ways to Die. Scudder is ex-NYPD whose current job is as an unlicensed P.I. Hes haunted by the event that caused him to leave the force. He got a commendation for it but he cant shake the memory. The ramifications of his actions that afternoon drove him to join AA and he has been sober ever since. But hes a shell of a man badly in need of something to drive away the demons. So he takes cases no one else would touch chasing salvation and finding that the closer he gets the more unattainable it is. If you want a happy ending go see Guardians of the Galaxy. Now eight years after his life changed Scudder is approached by the Kristo brothers. Peter (Boyd Holbrook) is an artist Scudder met at AA. Kenny (Dan Stevens formerly of Downton Abbey) is a drug dealer whose wife was recently kidnapped and returned to him in little pieces after he haggled over the ransom. Kenny wants Scudder to locate the killers a couple of psychos named Ray (David Harbour) and Albert (Adam David Thompson) so he can do to them what they did to his wife. After a period of initial reluctance Scudder agrees and what he learns convinces him that not only did the butchering duo slaughter two other women but they are likely to strike again. A Walk Among the Tombstones is more slow-burn than fast-paced although there are a few action sequences to punctuate lengthy periods of simmering tension. Its neo-noir as its rarely done because this kind of movie is typically too bloody and too repulsive for mainstream audiences. There are some movies you appreciate for their artistry audacity skill and singlemindedness but never want to see again. This is one of those. Scudder is uncompromising and Neeson plays him without once cracking a smile or leading us to believe hes capable of experiencing even a moments joy. The trailer in its shallowness makes Scudder seem like a clone of Bryan Mills (his character in Taken) but the only real similarities are that they look alike and neither is averse to using violence to achieve his aims. On a purely narrative level there are some hiccups. The multiple flashbacks used to detail background information interrupt the flow of the story. A subplot featuring a kid named TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) feels shoehorned in. TJs inclusion is supposed to reveal Scudders concealed humanity but as developed it doesnt work. Finally Franks decision to use a voiceover reciting the 12-step program during the climax is pretentious obvious and distracting. There are those who arent going to be able to watch this. Some will find it upsetting and I can understand that point of view. To me however Franks willingness to go dark and stay there is one of the movies strengths. This is about a wounded warrior facing death and not caring if it takes him. A Walk Among the Tombstones acknowledges the darkest aspects of the human condition without flinching. Its a tough movie but a rewarding one if the appeal is there.

"Life in a Graveyard Death at a Funeral Scott Franks Beguiling Liam Neeson Thriller and the Ensemble-Driven This Is Where I Leave You << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Life in a Graveyard Death at a Funeral Scott Franks Beguiling Liam Neeson Thriller and the Ensemble-Driven This Is Where I Leave You Movies September 19 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print With some movies you feel like youve pre-seen them. The ads and posters and casting tell the same story you watched the previous weekend. So you go in and wait for a sign that this version will in some way be different. You look for evidence the director knows what hes doing. A Walk Among the Tombstones gives you a sense not too far in that a sensibility is at work. The strings in the score play well with the xylophone kicking up an evocative air of mystery. But the surest indication that the movie is operating in a rarefied zone of confidence involves a simple long shot of Liam Neeson trudging up a Fifth Avenue sidewalk in Sunset Park Brooklyn. The camera takes long patient drags on Neesons carriage and stature. I say its simple. But not every Neeson movie cares enough to do it. For the last six years Neesons become the lethal-weapon choice -- a man of the law (one sometimes pushed beyond it) working out trauma through action much of it either exhilaratingly or exasperatingly stupid. Im used to seeing his limbs (or a stunt doubles) swinging and flying and chopping propelling him laughably across Eastern European rooftops or flying into wolves. Director Scott Frank tries something that feels new. Frank holds the camera on Neeson moving across the frame. Awe suffuses the image. Its as if Frank has never seen this actor before and wants to give the strong allure of his physicality its due. Every time Neeson takes a walk Frank takes him in. The director treats most of this film with similar delicacy warmth and attention to the whims of personality. Thats astonishing given what a grim piece of business the movie reveals itself to be. Tombstones enters the world of Matthew Scudder the former NYPD detective and recovering alcoholic from Lawrence Blocks mystery novels who now works as a private investigator in Brooklyn. Scudder is pensive graceful and serene. Nothing ruffles him yet he isnt cynically jaded either. The case he accepts here involves the lady in a drug dealers life. The men who kidnapped her demanded the dealer Kenny (Dan Stevens) pay a lofty ransom. He did but the kidnappers murdered her anyway and have moved on to other victims. Kenny hires Scudder to find her killers and bring them to him. Frank adapted the novel and patiently unfurls the story holding on to curlicues and wrinkles that another less certain writer might have flattened out or jettisoned altogether Kennys squirrelly junkie brother (Boyd Holbrook); a suspicious-seeming cemetery groundskeeper named James (Olafur Darri Olafsson); and the homeless teenage orphan TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) who appoints himself Scudders sidekick. All three actors are very good especially Bradley who spits out his slang with a strong Brooklyn accent. Frank permits the character both street intelligence and wonder. TJ has a way of noticing small but telling rhythms. During one of their first meetings for instance he tells Scudder that ""Daunte Culpepper"" is a name better suited for the world of private investigation than for the NFL. Indeed the film is set in 1999 the start of Culpeppers career and not far from the turn of the century. Frank quietly captures the sense of paranoid doom in the air that year. He adjusts the weight of the atmosphere. It deepens and darkens as it goes. Theres a smart dramatic arc; motifs redouble. New characters keep showing up (like the creeps played by Adam David Thompson and the outrageously excellent David Harbour who take the film to a new scary-funny place). You expect a thriller from a movie like this but the further into the case Scudder trudges the more soundly and unexpectedly Tombstones is able to hit the sweet spot of any good suspense film the pit of your stomach. Frank is a longtime screenwriter whos composed very good scripts (Dead Again Out of Sight Get Shorty Minority Report) and received writing credits on a few severely outlandish ones (Malice Heavens Prisoners The Interpreter). His other outing as a director 2007s cutthroat thriller The Lookout confirmed the kind of grubby scuzzy criminal landscape Frank prefers. Here what I found myself responding to though was the way the lurid story and the films style work together to draw you in. Theres so much insinuation in Mihai Malaimare Jr.s cinematography. It peers across the way from one apartment into another. The smudging and smearing of the camera frame feels like an act of past violence. Theres a tracking shot toward the side-view mirror of a van as its pulling away thats one of the images of the year. The camera cant get enough not only of Neesons face but also of the hard contours of Bradleys. Its searching these men for notes of good and evil. The sense of place is also strong in this movie. If you dont always know where you are in this film block to block you know at least that its streets and neighborhoods are somewhere real. Theres a kind of director who tries to capture a particular feeling of 1970s Hollywood cinema -- the direness the heaviness the haywire quality of some people the moral jaundice the realism. David Fincher got eerily close in Zodiac. Denis Villeneuve went for it in last years Prisoners and short-circuited. James Gray has been chasing that feeling his entire career often coming up Wile E. Coyote short. The director Hal Ashbys last film was 1986s 8 Million Ways to Die a Matthew Scudder mystery with a mustached Jeff Bridges a hot young Andy Garcia Rosanna Arquette and a sleek turn from the city of Los Angeles. It also wasnt going for too much and now feels like something from the Magnum P.I./Miami Vice era something whose poster would wind up on a hipsters T-shirt. Theres similar casual seriousness in Franks approach. Its formal but it isnt mannered. Theres jazz in his structure room to make you laugh and jump. Hes telling this story in a way that meets up with modest detective pictures like The Drowning Pool instead of going for the mood of the eras iconic political chillers. Other movies get the distinction too like Baltasar Kormakurs heist thriller with Mark Wahlberg Contraband. Frank doesnt risk a whole movie on nostalgia. A Walk Among the Tombstones manages to be innocent of its peers and simultaneously in communication with them. Its the difference between aping a classic and making something classical. This is what I want at the movies a surprise. Lately with this incarnation of Neeson you really felt as if youd seen him before. But Frank believes in Neesons size and experience. When a weirdo considers threatening him with a knife Neeson doesnt need an action sequence to disarm him just some calm verbal wit. This year Ive seen Neeson in four movies including the ludicrous and ludicrously fun airplane thriller Non-Stop. Even in an intellectual fiasco like Third Person he finds another way to convey vulnerable masculine authority. He was remote in Taken Unknown and The Grey as if he were hiding behind convoluted plot and chases and beatdowns. Theres some human variety to these performances now. Neeson this year is the closest anyones come to the bygone Western star Randolph Scott except that Neeson can act. A Walk Among the Tombstones doesnt overdo it though. His laid-back toughness puts the movie and its director in territory familiar to Frank. Theyre both out of sight.  Its difficult to see the members of the biological family in This Is Where I Leave You -- the Altmans -- seated side by side and not ask what drug biology was doing. How does Jane Fonda produce Tina Fey Corey Stoll Jason Bateman and Adam Driver? Driver has a thickness and bigness that doesnt correspond to the petiteness of Fey and Fonda. But the physical incongruity underscores how little these five have to do with each other as performers. The movie is about how disconnected the Altmans are but youd still like to sense some passing or grudging affection among them all. We dont meet Mr. Altman. Hes just died and his funeral is the excuse for good actors to scream and fight and undermine each other the way siblings do in ensemble movies that think like bad television. Each Altman child returns to the familys well-appointed Hudson Valley-ish home with a weekend bag of woe. Judd (Bateman) comes home early from work and finds his wife (Abigail Spencer) in bed with his shock-jock boss (Dax Shepard). He arrives for the funeral having told only his sister Wendy (Fey) that hes left the marriage. He tells everyone else his wife is laid up. Mom (Fonda) cant know about the estrangement only because it gives the movie an excuse to turn the news into a would-be comic outburst in front of scores of people. Wendy is married to the biztronic jerk (Aaron Lazar) who spends all of his scenes doing deals instead of offering condolences and helping out with their two small children one of whom is fond of placing his plastic toilet on the floor and doing his business. Paul (Stoll) and his wife Alice (Kathryn Hahn) are on a baby-making sex schedule which has turned them both brittle. Phillip (Driver) comes up with yet another allegedly inappropriate woman. This time its Tracy (Connie Britton) his tony shrink. As it happens Fondas character Hillary is a psychologist too the celebrity kind whose famous guide to raising children continues to garner her childrens resentment. It pains me to go on. But this information is merely stage-setting for the nonsense that follows. Hillary claims her husbands dying wish was that the family sit shivah for him though the Altmans arent even culturally Jewish. The kids throw up their arms at having to spend a week under one roof. That happens to be plenty of time for Wendy to go moony over the brain-injured ex Horry (Timothy Olyphant) across the street; for Paul and Phillip to fight about who gets to run their dads sports store the very place Judd runs into a girl (Rose Byrne) he liked in high school; for Alice whos desperate for a baby to come on to Judd hoping hell knock her up. (They too used to date.) She doesnt seem to care that hes sleeping in the basement on a sofa bed that cant fold out completely or that given the casting shell have a baby with a brother-in-law who looks nothing like her husband. The brothers sneak into a classroom and get high during their fathers synagogue service. They harass the ""hip rabbi"" (Ben Schwartz) they grew up with. Phillip drives Tracys sports car to chase an old fling. In funeral comedies fucking appears to be a form of mourning. This Is Where I Leave You amounts to everything I cant stand about certain American movies. It gathers too many good smart actors and gives most of them almost nothing interesting to play. I dont want to see Fey as guilty blubbering bigmouth. Thats a character description that plays to none of her strengths. The film prizes smugness over sincerity. It thinks that giving Fondas shrink a big brain and personality means it can laugh at her giving herself a bigger chest and that every time she bends over Bateman can be appalled. Its not seriousness this movie lacks. Its common sense. These are well-off people. If theres no room in Hillarys house for Judd he could stay in a hotel or across the street with Horry Horrys mother (Debra Monk) and the embarrassing plot-surprise who lives there. Either way sleeping on a bed that wont lie flat doesnt make sense Its also a couch. The incredibility of small details keeps you at a remove in a movie like this. I dont believe these actors as siblings or husbands and wives and exes. But I also dont believe theres nowhere else for Judd to sleep. Theres a lack of curiosity at work here too. What sparks fly or bonds form or tensions mount when a son brings home a psychologist girlfriend to his psychologist mother? Theres no tension no drama no reason for any of what happens here. Hillarys children are a mess and she doesnt seem to care. Neither does the movie. This is one of those Sundance comedies about a family that still believes there is novel laughter to be had in generic dysfunction. Theres a wealth of psychological material the movie isnt smart enough to explore. (Jonathan Tropper adapted his own novel which in this case is as ill-advised as performing ones own autopsy.) Director Shawn Levy also gave us Just Married Cheaper by the Dozen the Night at the Museum movies and Date Night. For him theres no distinction between a family movie and an adult movie about families. Theyre all just a kid on his plastic potty taking a dump.

Hal Ashbys 8 Million Ways to Die missed the essentials (it was set in L.A.) although it did have its druggy charms. Now the talented writer-director Scott Frank comes awfully close in his adaptation of one of Blocks better novels A Walk Among the Tombstones. Id be way more enthusiastic if Frank hadnt swapped out the books horrific unforgettable ending for something so conventional I can barely remember it a few days later. The bad guys (David Harbour and Adam David Thompson) introduced at the outset are very bad indeed. Theyre grinning kidnappers of women who take the ransom and then return their victims as agreed -- only lovingly cut into small pieces. An unlicensed PI who lives in a bare cheerless apartment Scudder (Liam Neeson) doesnt want the job of hunting them down when he realizes that the latest victims husband (Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey) made his money as a drug kingpin. But when he understands the depth of the murderers depravity -- and the inevitability that theyll kill again and again -- he knows he has no choice. Hes a trudger. He interviews witnesses finds evidence of other victims and wanders a gray malignant city in mourning over something he did years ago while drunk. Hes another of Gods Loneliest Men. The thing to remember about Block and Scudder is that alcohol -- and Alcoholics Anonymous -- are central. Block has talked openly about his decades-long attendance and Scudder is always taking breaks from detective work to pop into meetings. (He also tithes a percentage of his fees to various churches.) Though its never specifically cited the ""Serenity Prayer"" -- ""God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference"" -- is a controlling force. Scudder isnt a reckless vigilante eaten up with rage. He has the wisdom to know what cant be changed and what can. Hes centered -- sometimes to the point of being a little dull. What saves him is that he doesnt preach. He likes sitting in bars drinking coffee alongside unsavory characters. Hes fascinated by people who dont have control. (Wong Kar-wai was generally taken as the auteur behind the barroom drama My Blueberry Nights but Block co-wrote the screenplay and the film had as much to do with his worldview.) Scudder then is much different from Neesons other bad-guy-hunter Bryan Mills in the Taken movies. Hes slower and heavier-spirited. Neeson gives him the requisite weight along with that Hibernian sadness he carries in most of his roles. He looks terrific in his heavy coat with the collar turned up as he walks around Green-Wood Cemetery where pieces of a body turned up -- its as if his whole life is lived among tombstones. For some reason Neeson and Frank have decided to give Scudder a New Yawk accent though that hurts less than it might since its always slipping. Never have I been so grateful for an absent dialect coach. Its clear from the sunless palette and the measured one-thing-after-another pacing that Frank loves Blocks work and that goes a long way. The performances go a long way too. Stevens evokes every shade of the self-made drug kingpins thoughts His hands are tied but he visibly hungers to wrap them around the killers necks. Boyd Holbrook is eloquently jittery as his addict brother Olafur DarriA Olafsson has two vivid scenes as a graveyard attendant and what can you say about David Harbours tauntingly demonic Ray? Youd cross the street in life if you saw him coming. (Hes equally effective in the coming The Equalizer.) Franks biggest challenge was introducing a Block regular -- a wayward black teen named TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) who talks himself into Scudders life -- without making the relationship seem too sentimental. He only half-succeeds -- it is sentimental -- but it helps that Bradley has a hard unbeatific face and that the movie needs his bopping energy. And there I would leave it if not for that botched climax. Was the original shot and discarded? Whats there now is not just different from the novel it also features a recitation -- woven through the action -- of all 12 AA steps which just seems weird. But I could have lived with that. What I cant accept is the loss of the finale that gives A Walk Among the Tombstones its grisly poetic symmetry and conclusively demonstrates the difference between Scudders passive acceptance of violence and the vigilante fury of the man hes working for. Its true that the books ending would have been hard to bring off. For one thing Scudder plays only a peripheral role -- an action-movie no-no. For another it would give The Human Centipede a run for its money. But the way the movie stands its as if a vital body part has been lopped off. Which is ironic if you know what Im talking about.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 19 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 19 2014 848AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Liam Neeson - large of shoulder gruff of voice kind of gaze - continues his late-career series of action roles this time as Matthew Scudder the protagonist of Lawrence Blocks long-running New York-set detective-novel series.Set in the late nineties the story sees Scudder a recovering alcoholic and ex-cop hired by a drug dealer to find the men who abducted his wife. Scudder is helped out by a homeless teen T.J. (Brian (Astro) Bradley) whos steeped in the novels of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. They soon learn that two sicko vigilantes have been capturing and doing bad things to drug dealers dearests. Although overplotted and underexplained the movie is rich in memorable lairs Scudders minimalist brown drab walk-up the fat-padded furniture and dark matte walls of a nouveau-riche drug dealer (spoiled by a tacky nude of his wife) and an Eastern European mobsters suburban home with Laura Ashley wallpaper and family photos in gilt-edged frames.With its musty retro atmosphere A Walk Among the Tombstones brings to mind Margaret Atwoods prose poem about the juncture of noir and decor In Love with Raymond Chandler ""Not because of the mangled bodies and the marinated cops and hints of eccentric sex but because of his interest in furniture.""

Crime writer Lawrence Block may have had that definition in mind in the 1970s when he dreamed up Matthew Scudder the protagonist who so far has appeared in 17 Block novels. Late of the N.Y.P.D. now an unlicensed private investigator Scudder solves crimes for criminals who are unable to petition the police. In a way he scrapes away at confounding clues to reveal the raw skin of the facts. In return he gets paid under the table and off the books. As he puts it ""I do favors for friends and they give me gifts."" Hollywood tried a Scudder adaptation in 1986 the feeble 8 Million Ways to Die with Jeff Bridges in the lead and a script by Oliver Stone that director Hal Ashby threw out so the actors could improv. After a nearly three-decade moratorium Matt is back this time assuming the more imposing presence of Liam Neeson. Director-screenwriter Scott Franks A Walk Among the Tombstones from the 10th Scudder novel published in 1992 sends the P.I. in pursuit of two major sickos crafty sadists who kidnap the wives or children of drug dealers demand a huge ransom and when its paid mutilate and kill their victims. Repellently they fit the dictionary definition of scudder better than Scudder does. But Neeson brings Scudder far more gravity than the young Bridges did to the earlier movie. At 62 Neeson is a leading man with a face of chiseled concrete an action-film hero whose natural state is grim stasis. Hes also become a major box-office magnet. Five low-budget Neeson thrillers-- Taken and its sequel plus Unknown The Grey and Non-Stop -- have earned more than 1 billion at the worldwide box office. He has become his own B-movie genre and now he wants to move up to A-minus with A Walk Among the Tombstones. That chatty title in the wake of a filmography that has little use for definite articles and none for prepositions hints at Neesons aspirations to a higher screen IQ. You get that here -- literary allusions and citations of AAs 12-step pledge -- along with a dose of sadism not seen much in upmarket American movies since the glory gory days of The Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. Like those films this one is set in the 90s; it begins in 1991 when Scudder then a married alcoholic cop chases down two perps and accidentally kills a girl and soon moves to 1999 when he is off the force sober and alone and his fellow New Yorkers are anxious about the looming Y2K computer glitch. They should have been preparing for al Qaeda. His first client is Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens) a silk-smooth drug trafficker who paid 400000 in ransom money for the privilege of finding his wife returned to him in pieces. The killers Albert (David Harbour) and Ray (Adam David Thompson) have now abducted the young daughter (Danielle Rose Russell) of a Russian drug lord (Sebastian Roche). Scudders job negotiate to get the girl back alive. And then because hes the relentless remorseless hero in the crime genre do unto them. Frank who scripted the crime movies Dead Again Get Shorty and Out of Sight flays the Block novel of Scudders support group his AA sponsor Jim Faber the barkeep Mick Ballou. Intent on underlining Scudders loner status Frank also omits Matts girlfriend the former prostitute Elaine. Jenny Abraham makes a welcome cameo appearance as a doctor at Bellevue but the movie has no significant female roles. The few women we see speak little but get to scream as their more ornamental body parts are severed -- scudded -- by the kidnapper psychos. (To complete the PC-outrage perfecta the killers are most likely gay.) Except for the slicing scenes the movie mostly moseys as Scudder sifts for clues to the killers in their Brooklyn hideouts. These arent not the cool neighborhoods which have made Brooklyn the hot borough with Manhattan as its stodgy elder sibling. They are the last ungentrified sections where the streetlights seem too dim and the air is humid with threat and desperation. Another new movie The Drop written by crime novelist Dennis Lehane also walks these mean streets Brighton Beach for The Drop Red Hook and Sunset Park for Tombstones with inevitable visits to the landmark Green-Wood Cemetery the final residence of Leonard Bernstein Horace Greeley The Wizard of Ozs Frank Morgan and Red Hooks own Crazy Joey Gallo. Green-Wood is where Scudder grills a creepy groundskeeper (Olafur Darri Olafsson always a treat to watch) who leads him into the netherworld of sado-video frequented by the killers. Our taciturn Holmes also acquires a Watson T.J. (rapper Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) a street tyke who has an improbable love for old-time detectives Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe and uses Daunte Culpepper the name of the Minnesota Vikings quarterback as his nom-de-sleuth. Piquant choice for Frank he wipes out Scudders girlfriend but lets him keep his surrogate son. Its also amusing to see Stevens the British actor warmly remembered as Lady Marys sainted husband on Downton Abbey slip into his new career playing scuzzy Yanks with a patina of class. He completes the transformation this week in the socio-horror film The Guest which has more to offer in chills and chutzpah than the Scudder movie. The cluttered climax in a Mother Bates cellar explains little of the killers psychology; for that you have to read the book. But it does let Neeson assert his primacy as the cinemas most graven grieving grievous senior citizen -- a figure who doesnt so much star in his films as haunt them. This ghost of a movie star is never more at home than when walking among the tombstones. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

The quirky sidekick. The crimes that are so vicious so beyond understanding that vigilantism seems not only allowable but desirable. These are the building blocks of pulp. And veteran mystery writer Lawrence Block whos been doing this since the days of cheap paperback originals knows the architecture inside out as any of his Matt Scudder books will prove. One of them ""Eight Million Ways to Die"" got a disastrous Hollywood-ized adaptation about 30 years ago. Now the series has been dusted off and given a well-deserved second shot at life with ""A Walk Among the Tombstones."" This time there are slightly steadier hands in control. The story is back in Blocks well-loved New York. And director Scott Frank -- who adapted Elmore Leonard for ""Get Shorty"" and ""Out of Sight"" as well as directing his own clever ""The Lookout"" -- knows genre. Yet theres something a little over-familiar here as well as more than slightly skeevy. Of course the familiarity starts with star Liam Neeson once again cast as a personally pained mournful man of action who is happy to impart two-eyes-for-an-eye justice. Its a role hes begun to wear down to the nub but you cant deny hes well cast and authoritative. But things get even more cliched when it comes to T.J. Scudders streety spunky teen sidekick who serves no purpose at all (especially as played by the insufferable Astro). And the central crime -- kidnappers who snatch the loved ones of drug dealers then rape and dismember them -- is needlessly horrific. Frank however keeps things tense enough that we may not have time to notice one or two failings in the script. And he has a real feeling for getting the most out of Blocks New York locations particularly underexposed ones like Clinton Hill Washington Heights and College Point. And Neeson who could do these things in his sleep -- and may have to soon if hes going to keep up this pace -- is never less than convincing as a big sad man wracked with Catholic guilt and private pain but determined to see it through to another day or at least until this job is done. That doesnt quite overcome some of the storys flaws or the repulsiveness of some of the subject matter. (You dont need to see the details of a woman being brutalized to imagine the result.) But it does all make it easier to take -- and make us even hope that Blocks formidable Scudder is going to be back for good -- and better. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence sexual assaults strong language and substance abuse. A Walk Among the Tombstones (R) Universal (114 min.) Directed by Scott Frank. With Liam Neeson.

"Review Walk Among the Tombstones runs right into torture porn zone - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Walk Among the Tombstones runs right into torture porn zone Film Title A Walk among the Tombstones Atsushi Nishijima / Universal Pictures Liam Neeson as Matt Scudder in ""Walk Among the Tombstones."" Liam Neeson as Matt Scudder in ""Walk Among the Tombstones."" (Atsushi Nishijima / Universal Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Yes it has Liam Neeson but A Walk Among the Tombstones also features the graphic torture of women ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is the creepiest film Ive seen in quite some time and thats not meant as a compliment.This old-school thriller starring Liam Neeson as an unlicensed private investigator trying to right the worlds wrongs has a very modern emphasis on the graphic torture and mutilation of women. It may make me behind the times and out of touch to say it but how did we get to a place where watching that kind of activity is considered entertainment? In a movie universe where torture porn maestro Eli Roth (whose reprehensible-sounding films I hope never to see) has never lacked for articulate critical support both writer-director Scott Frank and novelist Lawrence Block (whose book is the source of the most gruesome scenes) will likely wonder what Im making a fuss about.Block is one of the mystery/private eye genres most respected names and Frank is a gifted screenwriter (""Get Shorty"" ""Out of Sight"") whose debut feature as a director was 2007s excellent ""The Lookout."" In their eyes Im sure the few minutes of explicit horror used to get and hold an audiences attention are the kind of upping of the ante necessary to satisfy what the culture wants and the market demands. Im aware that future torture-besotted generations may look back on my objections with the kind of genial disdain we reserve for people who railed against rock n roll but I cant help that. I dont live in the future I live in the here and now and for me those kinds of horrendous moments are simply unacceptable. It may make me behind the times and out of touch to say it but how did we get to a place where watching [graphic torture] is considered entertainment? ""Tombstones"" descent into the pornography of violence is especially disturbing because it comes clothed in the garments of a traditional PI film. More than capably written and directed by Frank and well acted by star Neeson and his able supporting cast this is the kind of film that invokes Sam Spades name not once but twice.Though the bulk of ""Tombstones"" takes place in 1999 it starts with a flashback to 1991 which is where we meet NYPDs Matt Scudder (Neeson) a bearded long-haired detective with a major drinking problem. We watch the unfolding of the gun battle that became the major crisis of his life though we arent told until later exactly why it led to his leaving the force. A Walk Among the Tombstones trailer A trailer for ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" starring Liam Neeson. A trailer for ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" starring Liam Neeson. See more videos Cut to 1999 and a clean-shaven Scudder is eight years sober and a stalwart member of AA. He works as an unlicensed investigator which means he solves problems for grateful people who give him cash as a thank-you. All strictly legal. Scudder is approached by Peter Kristo (Boyd Holbrook) a recovering junkie who goes to Scudders AA meeting. Peter says that his brother Kenny (Dan Stevens once upon a time ""Downton Abbeys"" Matthew Crawley) has need of his services and so he does.Kenny not to put too fine a point on it is a drug trafficker whose wife was kidnapped. Kenny paid the ransom but the perpetrators not only chopped her body into tiny pieces (which we see) but left behind an audio tape of her being attacked and tortured (which we hear). Thats bad enough but things will get worse.Scudder not a fan of drug dealers takes the case with reluctance which is kind of the way Neeson took the role. As the actor told The Times ""I had a knee-jerk reaction because I thought This is ""Taken"" territory more talking to bad guys on telephones.""Fortunately Scudder turns out to be a much more modulated character than ""Takens"" Bryan Mills and Neeson despair always in his eyes is quite expert at projecting Scudders been-there air of moody melancholy.A shoe-leather kind of guy whos so retrograde he does most of his work by walking around and talking with people face to face Scudder chats up his share of New York characters including an eccentric groundskeeper (Olafur Darri Olafsson) at a cemetery where yet another sliced and diced woman is found.Aided by an improbable sidekick a homeless teenager named T.J. (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) Scudder discovers a connection between the victims and were soon given the chance to witness even more torture. Especially disturbing is a flashback in which we see and hear the terror of a woman whos about to be chopped up followed by loving close-ups of the instruments the tormentors (played by David Harbour and Adam David Thompson) used for the terrible deeds. Truly this stuff is so unpleasant it makes you want to stay home lock the door and never come outOne of the last things on the screen in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is the American Humane Societys notification that no animals were harmed in any of the films scenes. If women had a powerful advocacy group policing how theyre portrayed on screen or at the very least the support of a rating system with the integrity to give this the NC-17 it deserves wouldnt we all be better off?Twitter KennethTuran-----------------------------------A Walk Among the TombstonesMPAA rating R for strong violence disturbing images language and brief nudityRunning time 1 hour 54 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Column Entertainment Liam Neeson David Harbour New York City Police Department Read more movie reviews gt;gt; Maze Runner may outrace Tombstones This Is Where I Leave You Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad78deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-walk-among-tombstones-review-20140919-column.html,200,awalkamongthetombstones15,awalkamongthetombstones,latimes

Grade C+ Liam Neeson the Atlas of action heroes carries the whole moral universe on his shoulders as well as a labored movie in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones."" This gruesome thriller based on the 10th book in Lawrence Blocks Matt Scudder series pits the recovering alcoholic and retired NYPD detective against two serial killers who kidnap females for ransom and torture them to satisfy depraved appetites. The snatchings culminate in dismemberment so it makes doggerel-poetic sense that Scudder is the one to solve the case. For eight years hes been struggling to make himself whole after a traumatic police shooting scared him off the force and the sauce. He now operates as an unlicensed private investigator cracking mysteries for people who cant go to the police - in this case heroin trafficker Kenny Kristo (a whippet-thin over-acting Dan Stevens). Kristo knows that psycho villains have killed his wife and cut her up. He wants Scudder to find the culprits so he can kill them. Scott Frank who directed and adapted Blocks novel sets the film in 1999 New York. Some of his period touches are knowing and hilarious like a taxi advertising the acclaimed 99 revival of Eugene ONeills great play about drinking ""The Iceman Cometh."" But Frank mostly overdoses on portentousness as he roots his solid hero in a city that fears coming to pieces. The camera takes in tabloid headlines and graffiti about Y2K; a climactic skyline shot with the World Trade Center reminds us that 9/11 is only two years away. Neeson whos been reborn as a bankable star is also the unusual actor who can lift this kind of weight. Unlike performers who translate the tenet of ""being in the moment"" into uncontrolled behavior Neeson can make a quality like wariness amazingly physical. His ability to convey knowledge and energy held in check turns a confrontation with a squirrelly cemetery groundskeeper from a hackneyed showdown into a sardonically amusing turn. One contained piece of violence involving nothing more complex than smashing a door window proves to be explosively funny because Neeson and Frank play on our knowledge of genre cliches. Too often though Franks staging and timing are as deadly as they are dead-on. Once a character steps near a precipice you prepare yourself for the drop. Frank clinched his reputation as a screenwriter with his witty adaptations of the Elmore Leonard novels ""Get Shorty"" (1995) and ""Out of Sight"" (1999). Now I wonder how much of ""Shortys"" humor derived from director Barry Sonnenfelds drollery and how much of ""Sights"" gritty romantic allure stemmed from director Steven Soderberghs originality and elegance. I was in the critical minority about Franks acclaimed 2007 writing-directing debut ""The Lookout."" That movie and ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" make me wonder why Frank prefers to write as well as direct. The great American screenwriter turned writer-director John Huston said ""In pictures if you do it right the thing happens right there on the screen."" Watching Franks films I feel as if what attracted him to a story remains locked up in his imagination. He doesnt exploit a filmmakers power to vitalize a script with atmosphere and spontaneous invention. His attempts at visual style refrigerate the action instead of heating it up. At his flashiest he intercuts a reading of AAs 12 steps with a shootout. Complete with ostentatious freeze frames the sequence inflates the pulp storyline into a tale of hard-guy redemption and plays like a clunky homage to the baptism/execution finale in ""The Godfather."" (Directing Franks script for Out of Sight"" Soderbergh used freeze frames to fix details of behavior in our mind that made sense only after we knew the entire story.) The film leans for uplift on Scudders surrogate parenting of a teenage artist and would-be detective named TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley). In Blocks book TJ thinks better of hiding in the bad guys vehicle ""because this aint no movie."" Long before TJ hides in the killers van in Franks version ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" has become just another movie bred out of other movies.

(Atsushi Nishijima/Universal Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 18 2014 400 PM Title A Walk Among the Tombstones Film Info With Liam Neeson Dan Stevens. An ex-cop tracks down serial murderers. Director Scott Frank (154) R Violence language brutality. Area theaters. Though it looks similar to ""Taken"" ""Unknown"" and other movies in which Liam Neeson plays a renegade enforcer tracking down the missing ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" has more to it. First the films set in 1999 New York. The city is edgy with Y2K worries and only a few years into experiencing less crime in the streets. Secondly the movie has stylistic flourishes that would feel at home in ""Angel Heart"" ""Tightrope"" and several of the grubbier but still watchable thrillers of the 1980s. Finally Neeson whose quality action flicks like ""The Grey"" and ""Non-Stop"" are few and far-between strides through this film with an air of weary gravity. The 62-year-old Irish actor uses his forbidding presence haunted attitude and smarts to great effect. An opening flashback details why Matt Scudder (Neeson) left the NYPD and turned to drinking. By 1999 hes sober in AA and an unlicensed private investigator (and as we see in several scenes a devoted Daily News reader). When Scudders hired by an upscale drug trafficker named Kristo (Dan Stevens) to find the fiends who kidnapped and killed his wife the investigation into what happened gets gruesome. It turns out the villains are snatching the wives and girlfriends of dealers and torturing the women before returning them in multiple garbage bags. Scudders legwork brings him into contact with several species of creeps as he learns who their next victim will be and how he might save her. From left Matt Scudder (Liam Neeson) Peter Kristo (Boyd Holbrook) Yuri Landau (Sebastian Roche) and Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens) plan their next move in ""A Walk among the Tombstones."" (Atsushi Nishijima/Universal Pictures) There are more than a few lurid things about ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" which gets its title from an ending set in Brooklyns Green-Wood Cemetery. In a metaphorical sense though Scudder has been expecting death for a while. Fans of prolific author Lawrence Blocks popular character may have been expecting a big-screen appearance sooner. The forgotten 1986 thriller ""8 Million Ways to Die"" starring Jeff Bridges was Scudders only other movie incarnation. ""Tombstones"" from writer-director Scott Frank (""Get Shorty"" ""Out of Sight"") nods to classic gumshoe procedurals name-checking Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe as Scudder scours the city. Theres a hokey side to such traditions personified here by a streetwise kid (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) who becomes Scudders sidekick. Theres a grisly aspect as well as we glimpse the killers barbaric methods in bits and pieces. But with the combo of Neesons natural solemnity and his action chops ""Tombstones"" treads compellingly amongst lesser thrillers. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

"A Walk Among the Tombstones satisfying film noir review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesA Walk Among the Tombstones satisfying film noir reviewA Walk Among the Tombstones a rare adaptation of prolific crime writer Lawrence Blocks work is a suspenseful satisfying film noir. Liam Neeson as unlicensed private eye Matt Scudder goes to some dark places to track down two vicious killers in A Walk Among the Tombstones.  (Atsushi Nishijima)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Sept. 18 2014A Walk Among the TombstonesStarring Liam Neeson Dan Stevens David Harbour. Written and directed by Scott Frank. Opens Friday Sept. 19 at GTA Theatres. 113 minutes. 14A.Lawrence Block ought to be pleased.A prolific and award-winning writer of crime novels since the 1970s Block has apparently been loath to have his books adapted into films. Only one of them up until now Eight Million Ways to Die was made into a film in 1986 and it was a critical and commercial bomb.Article Continued BelowA Walk Among the Tombstones a more faithful version of the source material also featuring ex-alcoholic private eye Matt Scudder is likely to rectify that first misstep.Blocks Scudder tales tend to explore the dark side on life in the Big Apple and in that sense the film holds true to the style.The story opens with a flashback sequence of sorts bedraggled cop Scudder in 1991 getting semi-loaded (free) in a bar when robbers break in and waste the bartender. In pursuit Scudder kills two and wounds a third.Flash forward eight years and Scudder is cleaned up and sober working as an unlicensed private eye taking on investigative jobs for cash ""gifts."" Writer/director Scott Frank wisely withholds the reason for Scudders sobriety until later in the film.When a drug dealer hires Scudder to find the men who kidnapped and killed his wife (despite the paid ransom) the case leads him down a dark rabbit hole in a hunt for two vicious thrill killers whove decided its time to make their mayhem pay by going after people who cant easily go to the police.Frank has shrewdly chosen Liam Neeson to play Scudder and Neeson is terrific in the role wholly believable as a not-overly sentimental ex-cop who has pretty much seen it all and uses old-fashioned gumshoe techniques and instinct to get to the heart of the mystery. With his gauntness and sombre air Neeson also fits the character physically and manages a pretty decent New York City accent without overdoing it.Theres also some good supporting work from Dan Stevens as the grieving but vengeful husband David Harbour as Ray the more talkative of the two killers and Adam David Thompson as his mostly silent partner.The case is pretty grisly though Frank keeps the explicit violence to the minimal required. Theres a very brief opening sequence of a woman in mortal distress that is blood-free but chillingly effective.A climactic scene in which the 12 steps of Alcohols Anonymous are intoned is somewhat gratuitous despite how central the issue of sobriety is to Scudders character. Block purists would note that Scudder would never flash his old police badge to get information. But these are minor quibbles.Frank creates a pervasive mood of tension and dread throughout -- much helped by Carlos Raphael Riveras melancholy score -- while negotiating a complex storyline making Tombstones a solid entry into the film noir genre. If Scudder returns to the silver screen he couldnt be in better hands than Franks.

Photo Credit Universal Studios / Atsushi Nishijima advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A former cop reluctantly gets involved in a kidnapping case. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE A dark lugubrious movie full of grisly fates and few thrills. Fans of Neesons ""Taken"" movies will be disappointed. CAST Liam Neeson Dan Stevens David Harbour LENGTH 154 Theres a contest going on this month to see which action star can play the toughest loner in the bloodiest movie. Judging wont be final until we see Denzel Washington in next weekends ""The Equalizer"" but right now the front-runner is Liam Neeson in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones."" Neeson plays Matthew Scudder one of the darker inventions of Lawrence Block a genre-fiction machine with more than 80 novels under various pen names. A former NYPD detective Scudder has blood on his hands a guilty conscience and an 8-year sobriety chip. These days -- the 1990s before 9/11 or even Y2K -- Scudder works as an unlicensed private investigator who does ""favors for friends."" He defines friends loosely His latest customer is Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens ""Downton Abbey"") a heroin trafficker looking for the men who murdered his wife. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break Scudder seems a perfect role for Neeson whose large frame (6-foot-4) and mature vintage (hes 62) have made him a formidable action star in movies like ""Taken."" As Scudder he cuts a romantic figure covering the streets of Brooklyn in a coat with upturned collar stopping only to put the screws to some hapless weasel. Initially ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" feels like an old-fashioned noir about a dogged gumshoe working a grimy city. Instead writer-director Scott Frank delves into torture and titillation mostly at the expense of women. The movies villains are two all-purpose psychos (David Harbour and Adam David Thompson) whose handiwork takes place largely off-screen but the suggestions are revolting enough. As the movie becomes increasingly bloody and nihilistic the troubling qualities of our nominal heroes -- a former cop paid by a midlevel drug-dealer -- become harder to ignore. Even Scudders ostensibly comedic sidekick a homeless teen named TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) comes off as depressing. Whats more the movie lacks action Before the grisly finale arrives Scudder throws exactly one punch. ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" feels like one of its villains spiteful sadistic and amoral. 237 MoviesA Walk Among the Tombstones trailer PLOT A former cop reluctantly gets involved in a kidnapping case. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R CAST Liam Neeson Dan Stevens David Harbour LENGTH 154 BOTTOM LINE A dark lugubrious movie full of grisly fates and few thrills.

Jody Mitori Liam Neeson in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" Liam Neeson has a particular set of skills but choosing worthwhile projects is no longer one of them. Even by the standards of his late-career devolution into an action hero ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is so stupid and hateful it needs to have a stake driven through its heart before it can spawn a franchise.With a laughable New Yawk accent Neeson plays former cop Mathew Scudder the subject of 17 novels by Lawrence Block. In Scott Franks trashy adaptation of the 10th novel in the series the year is 1999. Scudder is eight years removed from the NYPD which he left after he caused collateral damage during a shoot-out with robbers. Scudder was drunk at the time but now he is sober and working as an unlicensed detective.Scudder is lured to a meeting with Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens) a sophisticated drug dealer whose wife was recently kidnapped and then butchered after Kristo paid the ransom. Now Kristo wants Scudders help in finding and punishing the perps. Scudder initially balks at the proposal until he learns that several other wives and girlfriends of drug dealers have met similar fates perhaps at the hands of serial killers with connections to law enforcement.Scudders research entails a trip to the public library where a homeless kid named T.J. (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) tutors him about using computers which are due to stop working at the stroke of midnight on Jan. 1 2000. The tag-along kid is also ridiculously well-informed about the history of detective novels in case we miss the intended similarities between the world-weary Scudder and such classic gumshoes as Sam Spade. The virus of ridiculousness crashes the entire movie when we meet co-habitating cut-throats Ray and Albert (David Harbour and Adam David Thompson). Although theyve presumably extorted millions from drug dealers the two serial killers sit around in their underwear in an outer-borough hovel and drive an abduction van that is cut-and-pasted from a ""Stranger Danger"" coloring book. Oh wait -- it gets dumber. When Scudder finally corners the creepy killers the bloodbath is overlaid with an audio flashback to the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and the importance of submitting to the will of God.Its a little-known fact is that the self-help credo has a 13th step and it ought to be etched on the tombstone of every actor who strays from the path of integrity Accept that life is too short for bad movies.What ""A Walk Among the Tombstones""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 153  Content Strong violence disturbing images language and brief nudity Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday September 18 2014 Follow AnnHornaday In between doing ""Taken"" sequels and cashing paychecks for dross like ""Battleship"" and ""Wrath of the Titans"" Liam Neeson manages to sneak in projects of real quality -- films that remind viewers of the strength sensitivity and wounded vulnerability that made us love him in the first place. ""The Grey"" a terrific and lamentably overlooked action thriller from 2012 was one such movie. And ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" shows every sign of becoming one until it clatters fatally off the rails. As Matt Scudder a detective created by the prolific New York mystery writer Lawrence Block Neeson has found a sturdy credible alter ego and in the hands of director Scott Frank he becomes a genuinely original movie hero whos a throwback to another era a rumpled off-white knight full of grim wit understated irony and haunted sad-eyed gravitas. An opening prologue gives us Scudders origin story an episode in 1991 when while working as a New York City police officer he wastes some thugs after downing his morning two-shots-and-a-cup-of-Joe. Eight years later hes in Alcoholics Anonymous sober but not necessarily completely clean at least in his own recriminatory imagination. Neeson embodies Scudder with a mournful visage but an energetic stride He fills out the detectives corduroy jacket with a hulking physical muscularity thats on the verge of going to seed. Its the perfect role for the 62-year-old actor who manages to look younger and more vital than he has in years but somehow more irretrievably damaged as well. The plot of ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" gets underway when a fellow AA member approaches Scudder to find his missing sister-in-law. That leads the detective into a morally murky world in which his interests -- and by association the audiences rooting interest -- happen to lie with a bunch of petty outer-borough lowlifes. Remember the movie ""Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?"" An alternative title for this one might be ""Who Is Killing the Drug Dealers Wives of Brooklyn?"" Frank best known for his screenplays for ""Minority Report"" ""Get Shorty"" and ""Out of Sight"" directs ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" with straightforward efficiency and a downcast 70s-era mood. Presumably we have Block to thank for the derivative -- and troubling -- conceit of psychopaths torturing women as a plot device but Frank keeps the gratuitous luridness to a restrained minimum at least until the films bizarre third (or more accurately fourth) act. Most of the movie features Scudder walking the streets of Brooklyn at one point taking on a precocious homeless teenager named T.J. (played with deadpan charisma by Brian ""Astro"" Bradley); their patter provides some of the most enjoyable material in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" which is braced and leavened by welcome shots of bleak cynical humor. (Asked if he quit the force because the corruption got to him Scudder replies ""Not really. It would have been hard to support my family without it."") The mood is embellished by a marked lack of embellishment especially when it comes to the supporting cast Frank has wisely cast an ensemble of vaguely familiar but un-starry actors who deliver indelible performances as the motley assemblage of criminals and weirdos Scudder alternately courts and stalks. Particularly memorable is Olafur Darri Olafsson as a spooky cemetery groundskeeper named Loogan whose rooftop exchange with Scudder is one of the films most satisfying one-scene chamber pieces. The look style and smarts of ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" seem like such a refreshingly toned-down departure from the outlandishness of Neesons ""Taken"" franchise that its all the more dismaying when the film shifts radically into a sadistic tableau of blood and gore. Its a truism these days that every action-adventure no matter how promising winds up being ""Transformers."" Apparently now every urban thriller has to end up as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" In the case of ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" that means what has been a relatively sophisticated quietly effective vehicle for Neeson at his best veers into the kind of hyperbolic nonsense of Neeson at his worst. With luck Matt Scudder will return -- with more of the same patter and much less splatter.   R. At area theaters.

Photo/Video Universal Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Sept. 18 2014 217 p.m. ET 4 COMMENTS Nothing is a sure thing in movies as in life. ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" prompted hope on several counts. It was adapted from one of Lawrence Blocks perennially popular crime novels by Scott Frank who did the screenplay--from a novel by Elmore Leonard--for one of my favorite films of any category ""Out of Sight."" And it stars Liam Neeson a formidable actor who reinvented himself as a vengeful action hero in ""Taken"" a surprise hit released here five years ago. But Mr. Frank also directed this new film with a heavy hand and Mr. Neeson ever more vengeful intensifies rather than relieves the prevailing gloom as Matthew Scudder Mr. Blocks former NYPD cop whos now a recovering alcoholic and an unlicensed private investigator. More Reviews Tracks This Is Where I Leave You Related Reading Fall Movie Preview Watch trailers and clips from nearly 100 movies due out between now and Thanksgiving. ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" pays frequent homage to classic film noir. Scudders sidekick and wannabe private eye a young African-American street kid named TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) says hes read about Sam Spade Philip Marlowe ""all of those guys."" But TJ comes off as a wind-up shill for retro style and none of the films tropes--fancy camera angles dark streets persistent rain psycho killers in doomy settings Scudder trudging around the city on their trail--can hide the essential hollowness of a not-very-interesting revenge tale that takes a not-at-all-welcome turn into grisly ugly horror. Nor does Mr. Neeson help matters much with an almost literal reprise of his now-famous telephoned threat to an abductor in ""Taken."" Sam Spade never needed to recall past accomplishments. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Non-Stop (2014) Much of the fun in this airborne suspense thriller which was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra is awfully silly. The story strains logic as well as credulity. Its been cobbled together often crudely from pieces of classic predecessors. (Here snippets of Hitchcock there stretches of ""Speed"" with wings on the bus.) Yet the silliness parades itself in a spirit of cheerful self-awareness while Liam Neeson fills the thrill quotient impressively as an air marshal Bill Marks who learns that a terrorist with a bomb is lurking aboard his trans-Atlantic flight. Bills seatmate is played by Julianne Moore.

Universal Pictures Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1039 a.m. MST September 18 2014Liam Neeson plays a private eye trying to track down the killers of a drug dealers wife in Scott Franks film based on the Lawrence Block novel. Liam Neeson with Brian ""Astro"" Bradley in a scene from the action thriller ""A Walk Among The Tombstones."" (Photo Universal Pictures )Story HighlightsCritics review 3 starsThe film is based on the Scudder character in Lawrence Blocks novels.Neeson is good at playing wounded characters.There isnt a lot to the story; the film depends on Neeson and hes solid.Liam Neeson in another crime-drama? What is this ""Taken 3""?No. Thats next year. Sigh.But good news This time its ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" and Scott Franks atmospheric thriller is a step up from Neesons usual shoot-em-ups. Not a giant leap but a step up nonetheless. The film is based on the Lawrence Block novel that features unlicensed private eye Matt Scudder whom Neeson plays.RELATED 5 of the best movies starring Liam NeesonScudder is a wounded man not physically but psychically and Neeson plays that well. He has a haunted look about him as if it pains him to pull another trigger. The story develops patiently enough that it takes a while for that to happen anyway.The film begins in New York in 1991 when Scudder a police officer stops by a bar where they dont make cops pay for their booze. A violent robbery a shooting and then its 1999. Scudder is now an ex-cop in AA and taking cases. He does people favors he explains to a potential client and they give him gifts.In this case its Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens) who needs a job done. Kenny is a wealthy drug dealer whose wife is kidnapped and -- despite his paying 400000 in ransom -- killed. And chopped up into small pieces. Kennys junkie brother Peter (Boyd Holbrook) recommends Scudder whom he met at AA to Kenny. Reluctant to get involved in what seems like bloodlust for revenge -- and having to look past the 40000 payday -- Scudder turns Kenny down at first but soon hes on the case.RELATED azcentral.coms newest movie reviewsThe film has a relatively simple plot. The mystery isnt in who is committing the crimes (and yes they make a habit of this kind of thing); we learn early on that its a couple of creeps (David Harbour and Adam David Thompson). Franks concern and ours is how he gets to them.It will involve the help of a homeless teenager named T.J. (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) who actually knows how to use a computer who dreams of being a comic-book artist but seems willing to settle for junior detective. Its a weird sidetrack frankly present presumably to give Scudder a shred of humanity. For our purposes hes better off without it.Franks framing of scenes is intriguing sometimes inspired. Hes concerned with the look of New York on the eve of Y2K and the worries it caused; the muted washed-out colors contribute to the sense of dread.RELATED 52 Fall films to seeSometimes he tries too hard. The climactic action sequence plays out with freeze frames and a voice-over reading of AAs 12 steps. Its meant to be dramatic but instead just seems out of synch. The tenets dont match up with what is playing out on-screen.But how much you enjoy ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" ultimately boils down to how much you like seeing Neeson do this kind of thing. Who knows what planets had to align for him to become the unlikeliest of action heroes later in his career? This movie doesnt redefine him but it doesnt embarrass him either.Review A Walk Among the Tombstones 3 starsDirector Scott Frank.Cast Liam Neeson Dan Stevens David Harbour.Rating R for strong violence disturbing images language and brief nudity.AZCENTRALA Walk Among the Tombstones (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Photo Photo By Atsushi Nishijima - (c) 2 Review Neeson as knight in noirish ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" 1 / 3 Back to Gallery For a good straight-ahead noirish crime thriller you could do a lot worse than ""A Walk Among the Tombstones."" Liam Neeson gives a nice melancholy turn to his role as Matthew Scudder the private eye at the center of a long-running series of novels by Lawrence Block. The opening is a set piece that handily sketches the characters background. Its the early 90s (the novel was published in 92) and Scudder is an alcoholic cop in New Yorks less flashy precincts. One day he guns down a couple of bad guys but theres horrendous collateral damage. He quits drinking and leaves the NYPD and though he has no license begins taking on occasional detective work. Flash forward to 1999 with Y2K fears in the air. Scudder takes on investigative jobs between AA meetings and he disdains modern tools like cell phones preferring traditional methods lots of footwork waiting and watching etc. Because of his earlier trauma he is anything but quick to use a gun. Soon hes pulled into a nightmarish case. The wife of an affluent drug dealer (Dan Stevens) has been kidnapped and gruesomely murdered even though the husband paid the ransom. The perps are a pair of psychopaths who may or may not have some connection to the DEA but are sure to strike again. These two loonies (one is played with nasty relish by David Harbour) are straight out of a torture-porn movie which becomes clear in some brief but highly distressing scenes of sadism. Thats the films nod to the modern way but writer-director Scott Frank mainly has his eye on tradition -- Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade are mentioned several times in case we miss the point. Scudder has some of that knight-in-shining-armor glow and its hard not to like him He has scruples and for all his troubles a quiet sense of humor. Its a testament to Franks talent that he sidesteps what could have been a major mistake. Scudder is aided in his work by a precocious homeless black teenager (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) he meets at the library. The film could get all warm and fuzzy about this but doesnt as the young man proves a capable sidekick. Frank is also good at establishing the downbeat milieu Theres rain and garbage and graffiti on these mean streets. He makes fine use of the locations -- several Brooklyn sites are shown or mentioned and the climactic scene takes place at that boroughs majestic Green-Wood Cemetery. On the other hand the film does seem a bit long -- theres a reason many classic noirs were cut to the bone. Neeson has so much audience good will at this point that he (almost) can do no wrong. Hes very good as Scudder and with luck (and good box office) this could be the start of a series. Walter Addiego is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

He is hired by a drug dealer to find his kidnapped wife in New York City. VPCHe turns in his badge and becomes a brooding private eye. Even though that Scottish burr keeps blurring his New York accent he draws us in. Scudder was once married but now he lives alone in an apartment he spends little time in devoting many hours to AA meetings. When hes approached about doing work for a heroin trafficker Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens) his first reaction is to pass.USA TODAYTracks is a long strangely glorious journeyHe listens impassively as Kristo tells him about kidnappers who took his wife and asked for a ransom. After he paid the money they led Kristo to his wifes mutilated dead body. Now he just wants vengeance. When Scudder discovers that these might be the same guys who committed similarly twisted unsolved murders he agrees to take the case. When not tracking down killers the brooding Scudder connects with street-smart homeless teen TJ? ( Brian ""Astro"" Bradley). The pair has an appealing chemistry and their interactions are the heart and soul of the film.Liam Neeson in a scene from the motion picture ""A Walk Among The Tombstones."" (Photo Universal Pictures)Tombstones is a rather by-the-book police thriller where suspense is in short supply and takes a back seat to crackling dialogue. The story is set in late 1999 and discussion swirls about the topic of the day Y2K. USA TODAYThis Is Where I Leave You will leave your memory fast""People are afraid of the wrong things"" says Ray (David Harbour) one of the calm vicious killers. Its a dispiriting notion.Also dispiriting is the grisly violence perpetrated against women -- and in a film that has no substantive speaking parts for actresses. A particularly stomach-turning scene focuses on a womans terrified face and bare breasts while shes at the mercy of a sadistic rapist. In fact every female character in the film is victimized and most are brutalized.USA TODAYMaze Runner puzzles and not in a good wayThis marks the directorial debut of Scott Frank who wrote such stellar films as Out of Sight Minority Report Get Shorty and The Lookout. Here not all the writing works. A heavy-handed voice-over listing AAs 12 steps during a climactic scene feels forced. And action sequence are numbingly violent rather than thrilling.Supporting characters are given little to do. Stevens so appealing as Downton Abbeys Matthew Crawley is unconvincing as a drug trafficker. The killers are portrayed as both sadistic and mundane but never given dimension. One of the most off-putting scenes involves the adolescent daughter of a Russian drug trafficker. The murderers spot her on the street and the Donovan song Atlantis blares as the action goes into slow-motion. Perhaps were meant to be seeing from the perspective of their twisted minds as they spot their newest victim. However this stylistic sequence feels jarring. Audiences however will be drawn to a more soulful Neeson as a downtrodden gumshoe with a strong sense of decency and dark streak of humor. . 46 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1udY0kV",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/09/18/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-review/15476623/,200,awalkamongthetombstones25,awalkamongthetombstones,usatoday

Photo Universal Studios MOVIE REVIEW A Walk Among the Tombstones Running time 113 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity drug references). At the Lincoln Square the E-Walk the Magic Johnson others. They dont make em like ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" any more. Mainly because everyone got bored with em and stopped watching em. Based on a Lawrence Block novel the movie is a throwback to 70s private-eye TV shows the ones about scowling hombres with manful names like Mannix or Banacek. Writer-director Scott Frank even throws in freeze frames at climactic moments. Naturally our hero is an alcoholic gumshoe and former NYPD man Matt Scudder (Liam Neeson) who gets hired by a drug dealer (Dan Stevens a k a Matthew from ""Downton Abbey"") to find out who kidnapped his wife and left her chopped up in a trunk in Red Hook. Liam Neeson is on the case in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones.""Photo Universal Studios Cracking the case comes a little too easily to Matt. A quick trip to the library to trawl through microfiche -- this is 1999 and Matt is wary of newfangled stuff like Internet tubes and whatnot -- yields a clever adorable sidekick T.J. (played by young actor Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) who seems like the last kid in New York to know who Sam Spade was. He too is a figure straight out of 70s TV though in his case hes a sitcom type. Witnesses who say theyre reluctant to talk simply change their minds and spill everything they know. One guy (a superb Olafur Darri Olafsson) who works at Brooklyns Green-Wood Cemetery where the remains of another chopped-up woman were found acts so much like a man with secrets that Matt follows him home and breaks into his lair one of those standard sheds-filled-with-evidence that TV murderers always maintain. ""What gave me away?"" asks the creepy guy. ""Everything"" says Scudder. ""Youre a weirdo."" He turns out to be surprisingly chatty for a guy whos an accomplice to multiple slayings. Liam Neeson tries to piece the clues of a kidnapping together in the film.Photo Universal Studios The movie grows less and less plausible as it goes but Frank at least keeps things moving along competently and his actors are engaging. Stevens with his disreputable mustache and soul patch does a nice job distancing himself from his ""Downton"" dreamboat. But theres nothing new here nothing even pretending to be new in a plot that glides along gentle curves instead of sharp twists. When there is a big reversal of fortune this happens off-screen. Even the bad guys (whom we meet fairly early) are lackluster more off-putting than terrifying. Still you could do worse than watch Neeson barking orders at kidnappers over the phone and at such moments ""Tombstones"" is agreeably predictable. Its a Dad movie.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Every year so many artless gormless generically slick thrillers make their way into theaters that any time a genre director displays basic filmmaking smarts the result ends up seeming like a retro novelty. Such is the case with writer-director Scott Franks murky potboiler A Walk Among The Tombstones which stars Liam Neeson as Matt Scudder the unlicensed recovering alcoholic gumshoe created by Lawrence Block. (Scudder was previously played by Jeff Bridges in Hal Ashbys 8 Million Ways To Die.) Based on a 1992 Block novel but set in 1999--which is probably as close as Frank could get to the present day while preserving the mechanics of a pre-Internet detective story--the movie finds Scudder on the hunt for a couple of serial killers who only target the families of drug traffickers. Its a repetitive shoe-leather-type investigation which mostly consists of Scudder schlepping around New York pulling out a phony badge and asking questions. With the exception of one unsettling interlude involving a cemetery groundskeeper (Olafur Darri Olafsson) theres not much to distinguish Tombstones from any number of procedural mysteries at least not in terms of plot or performance. The pleasure of hard-boiled meet-and-interrogate movies lies in the flavor they put into characters and milieux; aside from the aforementioned groundskeeper and his rooftop pigeon coop none of the people or places the imposing gravelly-voiced hero visits would seem out of place in a middling episode of Law amp; Order SVU.Some kudos are due however to Frank and Neeson--the latter continuing his run as this generations answer to Charles Bronson--for handling Scudders commitment to sobriety with credible understatement. Scudders daily attendance of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings is integrated into both his work process and into the plot; its a frame for the story rather than mere window dressing.In fact A Walk Among The Tombstones is a movie thats easier to appreciate for its frames--both visual and narrative--than what it puts in them. Composed for the big screen with typical confidence by cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. (The Master Tetro) Tombstones looks like what old-timers would call ""a real movie."" Its sparing with closeups and rich with negative space purposeful overhead shots and one-point perspectives where the diagonal lines formed by streets hallways and stairways converge into a vanishing point.Periodically Frank--a screenwriter whose pulp cred includes the screenplays for Get Shorty and Out Of Sight--pulls out one of those resourceful tricks of design and direction that decades ago were the stock-in-trade of B-filmmakers. The scene that sets the plot into motion--a conversation between Scudder and AA acquaintance Peter (Boyd Holbrook)--consists mostly of a single static shot composed around a diner booth with Peter at first framed out; a pre-credits sequence depicting the incident that led Scudder to leave the NYPD includes an effective coherent foot chase and ends with a shoot-out rendered in two rigidly geometric wide shots. These moments--too economical and workmanlike to register as flourishes--arent enough to turn A Walk Among The Tombstones into a good movie but they give it a sense of confidence and form thats all too rare in todays thrillers.

New York is a pushers paradise Y2K fever is sweeping the globe and all crumpled crimefighters have a young black sidekick who says things like word and dope. But somethings amiss. If it really is 1999 shouldnt Liam Neeson be making better movies? Adapted from Lawrence Blocks thriller and presumably pitched as the first in a franchise centred around his Matt Scudder character this is a dour exploitative crime story. Neeson plays ex-cop-turned-private-dick Scudder whose investigation into the brutal murder of a drug dealers wife leads to a series of grisly discoveries. A Walk Among the Tombstones is well paced and fairly watchable but it does take itself desperately seriously Scudder spends much of the film agonising over his alkie past while the climactic gun battle plays out to the sound of someone reading the AAs 12 steps in a portentous monotone. The violence too is uncomfortably grim ultimately hinging on the potential rape and mutilation of a 14-year-old girl. Think Taken meets Taggart only not as much fun.

Distinctly and proudly old-fashioned in its retro film noir vibe A Walk Among the Tombstones is notable for its dark atmospherics and strong performance by Liam Neeson in the latest example of his unlikely late career transformation into an action hero. Less impressive in terms of plotting and characterizations the film should have a strong box-office opening but its relentlessly downbeat tone and relative lack of violent pyrotechnics may prevent it from launching a franchise. Scudder who first appeared in print way back in 1976s The Sins of the Fathers is a terrific character that Neeson -- whose casting the characters creator heartily approved -- expertly embodies with his usual physically commanding presence and world-weary gravitas. The films tense 1991-set opening scene efficiently provides the characters backstory as an alcoholic NYC cop who gave up the booze and the badge when his shootout with some bad guys on the streets of New York City went tragically awry. Cut to 1999 when hes working as an unlicensed private investigator who explains that ""I do favors for people... in return they give me gifts."" Enlisted by fellow AA meeting attendee and drug addict Peter (Boyd Holbrook) Scudder reluctantly takes a case involving Peters prosperous drug-dealing brother Kenny (Dan Stevens in a sharp departure from his heartthrob role in Downton Abbey) whose wife was kidnapped and returned dead despite his having paid a 400000 ransom. Kenny demands that Scudder find the culprits and bring them to him for retribution that clearly doesnt involve the legal system. After the discovery of another female victim this time left in pieces in trash bags in a park in Brooklyns historic Greenwood Cemetery the trail eventually leads to a pair of serial killers (David Harbour Adam David Thompson) who target criminals so as to avoid their getting the authorities involved. After discovering their identity from the cemeterys groundskeeper (a very creepy Olafur Darri Olafsson) Scudder pursues the sociopathic duo with the unlikely help of TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) a homeless black teenager who aspires to being a gumshoe himself. Things come to a head after the kidnapping of the young daughter of a Russian drug dealer (Sebastian Roche) with Scudder getting directly involved in the ensuing negotiations which include the sort of tense Taken-style taunting phone calls with the killers that Neeson could by now perform in his sleep. The films final act featuring violent set pieces in a basement and the spooky nighttime environs of the cemetery ratchets up the action considerably. At one point Scudder explains to his young apprentice that the main attribute a private eye must possess is a ""strong bladder."" Viewers may need one as well to get through the films dull middle section filled with long talky patches in which nothing much really happens. The compensation is that Neesons emotionally reticent hero is consistently engaging and refreshingly vulnerable preferring to talk his way out of tense situations and for the most part not even carrying a gun. Director Frank (The Lookout) whose screenwriting credits include Out of Sight clearly has an affinity for the material investing the proceedings with a darkly compelling atmosphere that recalls the best noirs of the 40s and 50s. The film benefits greatly from having been shot in various seedy NYC neighborhoods -- not to mention the spooky gothic cemetery that inspires the title -- with cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. (The Master) delivering a desaturated color palette accentuating the overall gloominess. At times the convoluted plotting proves too baroque for its own good and the subplot involving Scudders mentoring of the sassy teen who we eventually learn suffers from sickle-cell anemia is both silly and distracting. Setting the action in the year 1999 adds little to the story other than to accentuate Scudders Luddite tendencies with the impending threat of Y2K providing the opportunity for one of the villains to ironically observe ""People are afraid of all the wrong things."" The climactic shootout is marred by a too-fussy staging employing freeze frames and a juxtaposition of the tenants of the 12-Step program. If the film does launch a series theres plenty of material to draw from with some 16 other novels (including Eight Million Ways to Die adapted into a 1986 film) and a short-story collection published to date. It sure beats the prospect of seeing Neeson once again exploiting his ""special skills"" in the upcoming Taken 3.

Scott Franks detective thriller ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is at heart a fully old-fashioned pulp potboiler -- set in the convincingly ancient-feeling era of 1999 -- enlivened on one hand by a committed Liam Neeson playing a more cerebral version of his usual avenging heavy and soured by some predictable yet relentlessly sadistic savagery toward women. Too formally well crafted to be dismissed but too straightforward and uncurious to be particularly exciting or insightful this adaptation of Lawrence Blocks novel ought to at least provide a healthy counterprogramming option at the box office. Starting with a 1991 prologue were introduced to detective Matt Scudder (Neeson) a racial-epithet-spewing drunken cop straight out of the Popeye Doyle school. Double-fisting whiskey with his morning coffee Scudder happens to be out of sight in a tavern when a trio of armed assailants burst in and shoot the barkeep. Scudder gives chase and takes out all three only later realizing a young girl was killed in the crossfire. Come 1999 Scudder has retired from the police force and given up the drink working as a kindly unlicensed P.I. when hes not telling his story at AA meetings. Through a fellow addict hes introduced to Brooklyn drug trafficker Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens) who hires him to locate the two men who abducted his wife. Kenny already paid the ransom only for the kidnappers to lead him to a car with his wifes butchered body in the trunk. Now he simply wants revenge. Taking on the case the technophobic Scudder relies on his wits and shoe leather tracking suspicious types through the boroughs reading up on old cases in library archives and at times simply wandering the streets. Neesons late-career evolution into one of modern cinemas most reliable action stars has been something of an odd turn -- possessed as he is of such an inherent likability and an ineluctable kindness in his eyes -- and its a pleasure to see him allowed to play a quieter character here than the ropes-end brawlers hes limned of late. Along the way hes assisted by a sardonic homeless teenager named TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) who sleeps in the library and helps Scudder with Internet research. (The impending Y2K bug is a popular conversation topic throughout.) The character is a bit hard to buy -- and he speaks with urban slang that would have seemed suspiciously out of date 15 years ago -- yet his relationship with Scudder somehow works as TJ attempts to serve as a sort of assistant having absorbed volumes of Hammett and Chandler in his spare time. Gradually the two realize that Scudders current case is not the first of its kind A pair of kidnappers have been targeting the wives of drug dealers (who are unlikely to go to the police) for months always viciously killing their captives once payment has been received. It would hardly be an exaggeration to state that every single female character of any note in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is either stalked mutilated raped or murdered (in non-graphic yet disquieting disturbingly stylized detail) and none is granted more than a line or two of dialogue along the way. (Curiously the literary Scudders love interest Elaine Mardell has been cut from the adaptation as well as previously attached cast member Ruth Wilson.) Frank certainly never waters down the gruesomeness of the storys violence which is philosophically commendable but the film hes constructed is otherwise too much of a meat-and-potatoes genre exercise to bear the weight of such horrors. Part of the fault here may lie in Franks presentation of the killers who spend the first half of the film as shadowy boogeymen only to be formally introduced as an apparent gay couple reading the morning paper over breakfast. Played by David Harbour and Adam David Thompson these two are hardly budding Buffalo Bills and Frank never figures out what to do with their characters Lacking any sort of recognizable motivations for their grotesque crimes the newly visible villains diffuse a degree of the films tension and introduce an odd undertone of oblique homophobia along the way. In the films strangest scene the two killers are seen casing out a Russian drug lords house when they happen upon his preteen daughter (Danielle Rose Russell) crossing the street. They stare in disbelief as she walks by waving at them in slow-motion with Donovans ""Atlantis"" playing on the soundtrack a sequence bizarrely reminiscent of Bo Derek running across the beach in ""10."" Are we supposed to be inside the twisted minds of the kidnappers here experiencing the first sight of their future torture victim as something akin to first love? If so its a gamble that the film botches entirely and the scene simply hangs there in the mind as uncomfortable as it is unrevealing. Otherwise Frank orchestrates the more straightforward thriller setpieces with a good deal of panache and style. The climatic shootout is handled well; a quietly bravura interview sequence in a rooftop pigeon coup is better still. Mihai Malaimare Jr.s photography is consistently impressive and composer Carlos Rafael Rivera offers a score that is unexpectedly melodic yet entirely effective.

Popeye Bluto says May 30 2016 at 336 pm Saw this on HBO this weekend and couldnt quit watching. My thoughts all the way through were ""This is REALLY"" a good movie......................"" Reply Barry Leslie says June 24 2015 at 736 am This is no thriller it is more stinker than anything. I have come to realize anything that has Danny Divitos name on it will be disappointing and Even Liam Neeson cant save this looser. So sad. Reply Roger says September 23 2014 at 848 pm Who gave this fellow credentials to write anything vaguely coherent and clear. Reply Momo says September 21 2014 at 746 pm ""and he speaks with urban slang that would have seemed suspiciously out of date 15 years ago"" Clearly hasnt seen the film or met black people. Reply Robin Gaige says September 19 2014 at 1009 am Did we see the same film?? ""Epithet-spewing""??And yes there were women victims but most of the violence is implied not shown. It was a thoughtful representation of a classic crime novel. Reply OdinSon2k14 says September 18 2014 at 215 am Haha...he unwittingly spoiled the movies killers ). Reply No Thanks says September 17 2014 at 908 am This film would have worked much better as a straight thriller/investigation piece. Its too staked. Just tell a simple story with a complex character. I enjoyed the first 50 seconds of the trailer but it comes off the rails. You dont need all of this complexity. Reply Old School Quality says September 16 2014 at 1051 pm Its sad when Varietys reviewers cant appreciate the merits of an old school thriller without having to get all politically correct on the filmmaker for faithfully adapting Lawrence Blocks novel. Bad guys are bad guys for a reason. Guess what? They dont treat people nice. Women are vulnerable in our society and are often victimized for being such. Do we never depict such depravity in a film because its uncomfortable to watch? The whole plot of A WALK... hinges around the notion that even bad guys sometimes need someone to protect them from worse bad guys. This world is all layers deep in evil. Thank god for Matt Scudder.

Based on one of those Lawrence Block novels thats pretty smart but also too invested in the mechanics of rape and torture the movies a grim beauty shot like nobody told writer-director Scott Frank hes supposed to be churning out schedule-filling late-summer product. Instead Frank has crafted the kind of thriller that Neesons brooding elder-toughs have deserved all along a tense and prickly picture more interested in shoe-leather investigative work than in making a lark of brutal deaths. Neesons Matt Scudder -- the glum ex-cop hero of many bloody Block books -- bobs about Franks colorless pre-millennial New York like a cigarette stub in a cans last spit of beer Hes forgotten and unwanted where no one would ever look. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But that New York is worth looking at. Savoring even in its grand decay. Without sacrificing the momentum of the crime story Frank and director of photography Mihai Malaimare Jr. immerse us in long static shots sharply composed where we see into one hollow of the billions rotted into the city -- and are left to wonder what outside life might be pressing in on our hero. An early scene exemplifies the technique On the right side of the screen Neeson slumps in a booth too early in the day at some deserted olive-drab bar. To his left via a natural split-screen effect we see the proprietor out of Neesons sight and then far up above him the door to the street. Sickly light cuts in through a window guiding our eye to the doorway. Everythings still a little pathetic but were cued to be attentive to divide our gaze between Neesons dispirited lump and the someone we know will soon bust in and get the movie started.Its a rare moment of quiet and breathing and dread in a studio picture. Its echoed later by the scenes of Neeson on the case picking his way through the hallways of buildings we know he shouldnt be in. As in a strong horror film dangerous possibility crowds into the best moments -- what you imagine this New York might cough up could be scarier than what it eventually does.Film DetailsCritics Pick A Walk Among the Tombstones RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time114 More Info Trailer Not that the villains of A Walk Among the Tombstones arent unsettling. The case Neesons on is yet another kidnapping this time of the wife of a drug trafficker (Dan Stevens) who offers 40 grand to Scudder to locate the perpetrators. They turn out to be mundane and uncanny at once Goateed white boys pale as the grubs under rocks played by David Harbour and Adam David Thompson their faces artfully shielded from us for much of the film. Of course Scudder finds theyre up to much more than this one abduction and Frank dutifully shows us flashes of his heavies engaged in the sexualized violence so common to bestselling crime novels. He suggests it rather than dwells but what excuse is there for a scene of a rapist calmly demanding a woman choose which breast he wont slice off especially in a film that otherwise never finds time for a woman to have a speaking part? In Scudders world as on the paperback rack at the drugstore women are there to be saved rather than talked to. I ask this next question as someone who mostly admires the film Doesnt the fantasy of avenging unthinkable crimes demand fantasizing about those crimes?Still A Walk Among the Tombstones is an uncommonly well-made thriller. Neeson spends most of the film in bummed-out sleuth mode puzzling rather than fighting commanding the screen even as his Scudder sinks into the shadows. The painstaking buildup makes the killing when it comes more terrifying and cathartic than is the Hollywood norm. The Taken films invite viewers to cheer violence; A Walk Among the Tombstones with some moral force insists that you want nothing to do with it.Neesons character is freighted with past tragedy and its no surprise when we see him at an AA meeting. Few movie stars are more adept at suggesting having aged with grievous regret a mode that suits a man who blew a year of his life making The Phantom Menace. The specifics of a late-career Neeson bruisers particular backstory hardly matter What he offers audiences besides his wounded soulfulness and dogged grace is hopeful struggle the rediscovery of purpose the promise that through just and forthright action even the most lost of us can earn a place among the living -- a hollow worth inhabiting. At the climax Frank endeavors to tie Scudders heroics directly to his fight against alcoholism a gambit that confirms the writer-directors courage even as it gums up the storytelling. The final beats of the action are linked via voiceover to AAs 12 steps none of which exactly cover how to fend off a garrote attack.Neeson gets a sidekick a teenage African-American boy who seems to be homeless and helps him with the internet. The kids dialogue is hokey and its unfortunate that he gets jumped for his Timbs but theres something reassuring about his reluctant friendship with Scudder. In the summer of Ferguson heres a gun-happy ex-cop white as the cliffs of Dover trusting his life to a kid he once might have stop-and-frisked.2 Atsushi Nishijima Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.
