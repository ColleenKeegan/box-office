Sperm bank jokes. Jokes about toe sucking Viagra-fueled erections eating live mice and doing unspeakably vulgar things to French toast. No doubt about it When it comes to gross-out humor ""Road Trip"" is even grosser than last years ""American Pie."" Its hardly likely to gross more than its notorious predecessor but this first feature by award-winning documentarian Todd Phillips (""Frat House"") aims low and scores big often enough to attract a generous slice of the youth market. Theatrical gross will be pumped by repeat business and word of mouth. Not so far down the road ancillary biz should be brisk. Much more exuberantly funny than its generic title might indicate ""Road Trip"" focuses on the rude crude and occasionally lewd behavior of four college pals on a cross-country misadventure. At New Yorks Ithaca College chronic underachiever Josh (Breckin Meyer looking very much like a trash-compacted Bill Maher) makes a big mistake when he assumes his suddenly incommunicado girlfriend Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) must be misbehaving while attending college in far-off Austin Texas. Deeply wounded -- and yet perhaps just a little relieved -- Josh compounds his error by giving in to temptation. Well actually he doesnt just give in -- he lies down and allows himself to be mounted -- but never mind He has a terrific night of whoopee with the beautiful Beth (Amy Smart) who has long lusted for Josh and who impulsively records the evenings festivities on videotape. The next morning Josh discovers that Tiffany wasnt returning his calls only because she was coping with a family tragedy. Trouble is Josh also discovers that another tragedy may be in the offing One of his roomies has accidentally mailed the Beth-does-Josh video to Tiffany. Frantic to retrieve the tape before Tiffany receives it Josh sets out for Austin accompanied by three friends E.L. (Seann William Scott of ""American Pie"") a wild-eyed party animal; Rubin (Paulo Costanzo) a cerebral stoner; and Kyle (D.J. Qualls) a reedy geek who lives in constant dread of displeasing his overprotective father (Fred Ward). Under normal circumstances Kyle wouldnt dream of going on a road trip with the other fellows -- and truth to tell the other fellows wouldnt dream of asking him. But since Josh borrows Kyles car for the journey Kyle kinda-sorta feels compelled to go along for the ride. Additional complications arise when Beth -- whos understandably miffed about being treated as a one-night stand especially since she genuinely believed Josh and Tiffany had broken up -- hits the road on her own. Shes determined to break the bad news to Tiffany in person. Unfortunately Beth is misdirected by Barry (MTVs Tom Green) Joshs mondo-bizarro buddy who sends her to Boston instead of Austin. Even more unfortunately Tiffany says the wrong thing to the wrong girlfriend who proceeds to wreak havoc on a totally innocent boyfriend. Meanwhile back on the road and racing against time the four travelers wreck their car lose most of their money and nearly cause an unpleasant incident at an African-American college frat house. Desperation leads to improvisation The guys steal a bus from a school for the blind earn some quick money as sperm donors and fortuitously find a way for Kyle to lose his virginity. Not even the inconvenient appearance of Kyles hot-headed father can spoil the fun. Working from a loosely knit picaresque screenplay he co-wrote with Scot Armstrong director Phillips strikes the right balance of beery anarchy and sly calculation in constructing an anything-goes comedy that isnt nearly as politically incorrect as it seems at first glance. The filmmakers want to have their ""American Pie"" and eat it too so they nimbly avoid stereotyping while rolling out the raunch. At the African-American frat house for example the four white leads not their bemused black hosts serve as the butts of broad jokes. And the female characters even the less-than-virginal ones are what feminists might describe as ""empowered"" in that they always are the ones to decide who gets to do what when and how during close contacts. E.L. is a hormonally inflamed sexist who prods Josh toward extracurricular activities -- ""Before you know it youll be 40 and youll have to pay for these kinds of girls"" -- but this tiger is easily tamed by a domineering nurse who knows just where to place a gloved and lubricated finger. (This cues the pics funniest most likely to be quoted line ""That was ... awesome."") Tiffany turns out to be slightly more experienced than Josh assumed -- but ""Road Trip"" is too honest or at least too frankly raunchy to hold this against her. Indeed the filmmakers are quite generous in rewarding anyone with a healthy sex drive even when the reward calls for upending audience expectations regarding how this kind of comedy usually resolves itself. In the world according to ""Road Trip"" even a conventionally ""bad"" girl can get what she really wants and a wacko like Barry can get what he needs before he knows he wants it. The attractive and engaging young leads are game for just about anything and their enthusiasm is highly contagious. In his bigscreen debut Tom Green comes off as a younger marginally hipper version of Bill Murrays wacky groundskeeper in ""Caddyshack."" But the most memorable scene-stealer among the supporting players is Edmund Lyndeck cast as a pot-smoking Viagra-munching senior citizen who hears the darnedest things when hes stoned. The eclectic soundtrack -- everything from Kid Rock to Run-D.M.C. to Twisted Sister -- enhances the antic mood and the rest of the tech package is good to go. But be forewarned After you see ""Road Trip"" it may be months if not years before you can order French toast with a straight face and a settled stomach.

"Road Trip | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; road-trip ) Road Trip (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli In the 1980s Porkys spawned an era of teen sex comedies that took most of the decade to die out. Last year American Pie re-invented the genre albeit with more wit moxie and forthrightness than anything in the 80s ever showed. Todd Phillips Road Trip becomes the first 2000 follow-up to American Pie - a road movie that is more interested in gross-out jokes and sex gags than in getting its four protagonists from point A (Ithaca) to point B (Austin). As with American Pie the film spends time developing a degree of personality for its characters - theyre certainly not well-rounded but they are intended to be more than cardboard cutouts to hang the humor on. Unlike the earlier movie however Road Trip lacks the surprising romantic sweetness that gave American Pie its more widespread appeal. Josh (Breckin Meyer) a University of Ithaca student is suffering through a romantic crisis. His life-long girlfriend Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) who is attending the University of Texas has stopped returning his phone calls and Josh is convinced shes cheating on him. So haunted by visions of her in another guys arms he succumbs to the seductive wiles of Beth (Amy Smart) a girl who has a crush on him. The camcorder is running while they have sex and the tape is accidentally mailed to Tiffany the next day (one of Joshs roommates mixes it up with the ""I miss you"" tape Josh had intended to send). And shortly after the tape gone out Tiffany calls and explains that she has been out of touch because her grandfather died. So in a last-ditch attempt to intercept the tape and save his relationship Josh and three friends (Sean William Scott DJ Qualls Paolo Costanzo) get in a car and head south on a three-day 1800-mile road trip. As with all road movies its not getting there that matters but what happens along the way. And in the case of Josh and company that means plenty - a lot of which has to do with sex. The film features all sorts of outrageous and potentially offensive situations a diner cook who makes French toast in a way that may discourage anyone from ever eating it again copious gratuitous female nudity feet and panty fetishes sperm donations a prostate massage the robbery of a blind woman and an encounter with a horny old man. In addition to chronicling the mishaps that define Joshs trek to Austin Road Trip also follows three other plot threads. The first involves the parents of Kyle one of Joshs friends who believe their son has been kidnapped. Kyles father (Fred Ward) armed with a gun sets off for Austin on a rescue mission. Meanwhile Beth mistakenly believes that Josh has gone to Boston (sounds like ""Austin"") so she heads up there to inform a ""Tiffany Henderson"" that her boyfriend has been unfaithful. (Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned...) Finally theres Barry (Tom Green) one of Joshs friends who doesnt make the journey and his saga of feeding a live mouse to a lazy snake. Road Trip isnt as smart or as funny as American Pie but there are still some big laughs to be had. As expected the dramatic elements amount to nothing more than inconsequential filler but theres enough genuinely amusing humor strewn throughout to keep things moving. Phillips probably wants us to care about the characters and their fates more than we actually do. While its true that he gives each of them a backstory and the semblance of a character arc we never connect with any of these individuals on a deep or meaningful level. The actors are fine for their roles although based on what they have to do here its difficult to determine whether any of them have range or talent. Breckin Meyer is affable but not much more. Sean William Scott (who was in American Pie) has the sex-crazed college student down to a ""T"". DJ Qualls plays a credible nerd and like all movie nerds he experiences a life-changing moment. Paolo Costanzo has the least visible part of the four leads - his portrayal of an intellectual druggie often fades into the background. Tom Green narrates the story which is presented in flashback form - this allows Green who is perhaps the most consistently amusing performer in the film some additional screen time and also provides an amusing explanation for some of the gratuitous nudity. The girls Amy Smart and Rachel Blanchard look cute but arent given much to do. Determining who will be offended by Road Trip isnt difficult - anyone who was comfortable throughout Theres Something About Mary and American Pie wont have any trouble with this movie. Whether those individuals enjoy Road Trip is an altogether different question. The movie is sloppily made but theres almost a sly charm to the sloppiness and the unevenness of the filmmaking doesnt detract from the pictures most obvious laughs. Set loose amidst so many big-budget giants Road Trip may cause a few viewers to take the detour to a theater where its playing but this is a path that might better be left unexplored until the movie reaches the video store.

Starring Breckin Meyer Amy Smart and D.J. Qualls. Directed by Todd Phillips. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Road Trip"" which opens today was directed and co- written by Todd Phillips not a household name but a name to be reckoned with all the same In 1998 he won the best-documentary prize at the Sundance Film Festival for a picture called ""Frat House"" an uncompromising look at campus fraternities and their strange rituals. He has also turned up as a cabdriver on HBOs cinema verite series ""Taxicab Confessions."" His deadpan demeanor suggests a knack for comedy and he gives himself a small role in ""Road Trip"" as a foot fetishist. Make no mistake ""Road Trip"" is little more than a sleazy lightweight comedy produced by Ivan Reitman as a kind of aughts answer to ""Animal House."" Yet there are enough clever touches in Phillips direction to suggest that this narrative feature debut might mark the beginning of an interesting career. The cast of relative unknowns is headed by Breckin Meyer who plays Josh a young fellow trying to stay loyal to his girlfriend even though he goes to school in Ithaca N.Y. and she attends college in Austin Texas. One day he goes to a party and comes home with an aggressive young woman (Amy Smart) who turns on a video camera and tapes their lovemaking -- a daring move for a girl who is also presented as sensitive and levelheaded. The fun starts when the sex tape is accidentally put in the mail to Joshs girlfriend. Its Friday. Josh has three days to intercept the tape in Austin but he has no car and no money for airfare. The situation calls for . . . a road trip so Josh and three of his buddies pile into a Ford Taurus and take off. Phillips who graduated from New York University in 1994 clearly remembers what it was like to go to college. One thing he remembers is that there is little that is innocent about those years that this is often an uninhibited period of life. Though some viewers might be put off by the frankness of the sex talk and by the abruptness with which people tumble into bed ""Road Trip"" at least has the ring of truth. Phillips also has a farceurs knack for topping his punch lines. Some filmmakers play cute with the audience trying to create interest by delaying the inevitable. In ""Road Trip"" things happen quickly and those things lead to other bigger things. ""Road Trip"" may not be an ambitious film but it doesnt lack for imagination and the nasty edge of its comedy makes it refreshing. The cast is adequate. Meyer is not the most inspired leading man but he gets the job done. Smart is better as the intelligent and randy Beth. The films real find is D.J. Qualls who is very funny as a jug-eared nerd who blossoms into a wild man after three days on the road. -- Advisory This film contains nudity and harsh language. ..

B Road Trip Genre Comedy; Starring Rachel Blanchard Paolo Costanzo Tom Green Breckin Meyer D.J. Qualls Seann William Scott Andy Dick; Director Todd Phillips; Author Scot Armstrong Todd Phillips; Release Date Wide 05/19/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 97; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Dreamworks Distribution L.L.C. Posted May 26 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT Its rare that a movie prods and reshapes the culture but in 1978 the slovenly frat-boy high jinks of National Lampoons Animal House did just that. Food fights peekaboo nudity boogie-till-you-puke toga parties Overnight the movie put a generation in touch with its yearning for salacious slob liberation. It was the real kickoff three years before MTV of Spring Break as a state of mind. It was also the launch-pad of course for a thousand crudely raunchy imitators --the gross-out exploitation comedies of the 80s like Gorp and Private School and the box office smash Porkys (which was essentially Animal House with less wit and more breasts). Most of these pictures were junk yet they had one thing going for them an internal Enemy. They helped set the tone for a world in which piggy excess was cool and responsibility and good taste were to be attacked and destroyed. Back then no one could have guessed that the grade-Z Animal House clones would one day be remembered as hip dumb touchstones and fondly recycled in movies like American Pie and the clever shallow genially vulgar Road Trip. The new models if anything are superior to the old -- smartly paced studio machines stocked with gifted young actors who love to clown. They also let women in on the action allowing them to be sharp-tongued characters and not just hot-bod pinups with movable parts. What these movies dont have -- cant have -- is the genuine roguish kick that comes from slaying an Enemy. Spring Break anarchy after all is no longer a rowdy rock amp; roll stance its the status quo and good taste is but a distant memory. Road Trip which like Animal House was produced by Ivan Reitman celebrates the triumph of hedonistic righteousness in a world where it already rules. In Ithaca N.Y. nice-guy college student Josh (Breckin Meyer) is struggling to maintain a long-distance relationship with Tiffany (Rachel Blanchard) his childhood sweetheart but he cant resist the tawny blond charms of Beth (Amy Smart). When a homemade video of their hot sexual encounter is accidentally mailed to Tiffanys dorm in Austin Tex. he takes off on a frantic three-day joy ride to intercept the tape and sidestep disaster. Along for the journey are two buddies party animal E.L. (Seann William Scott) who preens like a BMOC version of Sugar Rays Mark McGrath and sensitive brainy Rubin (Paulo Costanzo) a kind of junior Jerry Seinfeld. Rounding out the group is Kyle the much-ridiculed virgin dork who provides the car. Hes played by newcomer DJ Qualls who proves to be a major scene-stealer with his little-boy naivete and weirdly elastic beaky bird face. The very title Road Trip has a basic-goods 80s-nostalgia flavor; it hints that the movie is going to revel in its high-concept lowbrow glory. The director Todd Phillips is the former punk-provocateur documentarian who made the controversial Frat House and here helming his first Hollywood feature hes careful not to break any taboos that havent already been thoroughly pre-smashed; he stages the movie as a series of flip naughty-but-not-too-naughty set pieces. The boys wreck their car procure a bus from a school for the blind crash at an African-American fraternity and visit a sperm bank where in one of the few moments of all-out hilarity the macho E.L. gets in touch with an unexpected erogenous zone. If Phillips brings anything fresh to the movie its a predilection for slightly outre sexual kinkiness. He gives himself a cameo as a fuzzy-haired foot fetishist and the scene in which Kyle loses his virginity to a sweet girl whos as roly-poly as she is game probably touches closer to a lot of peoples squirmy realities than theyd care to admit. Along the way Tom Green MTVs goateed reptile narrates the film as he tries to get a boa to dine on a live mouse then flirts with gulping it down himself. He never does eat the damn thing and thats Road Trip in a nutshell slick reasonably amusing never asking its audience to swallow anything too wild for consumption.
