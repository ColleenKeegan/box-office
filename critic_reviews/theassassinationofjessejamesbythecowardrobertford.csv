Kimberley French/Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Kimberley French/Warner Bros. Odd couple Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck get a little too close in The Assassination of Jesse James ... . Kimberley French/Warner Bros. Director Andrew DominikGenre Drama WesternRunning Time 160 minutes We all know about the price of fame but its the price of infamy that fascinates these days. And judging from an intriguing new Western The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford that was no less true a century or so ago. Gunslingers Frank and Jesse James were celebrities in 1881 -- despised by the law but heroes to a host of nobodies who read nickel novels and dreamed of riding with the James Gang. Robert Ford a weaselly picked-on 19-year-old little brother of a James Gang member is one such. When Ford begs the brothers to give him a shot hes dismissed by Frank James -- ""the more you talk the more you give me the willies"" says the outlaw. But Franks brother Jesse is sort of amused by young Bobs hero-worship -- amused enough to keep the kid around anyway. And when paranoia strikes which it often does Jesses nervous enough to keep him close. Of course closeness is part of what Ford wants and eventually he gets so close that Pitts puzzled Jesse ends up asking ""Do you want to be like me? Or do you want to be me?"" The sort of Oedipal question a father might ask a son no? Now when a movie gives away as much in its title as this one does a filmmaker had better have something besides plot up his sleeve. What writer-director Andrew Dominik has is a psychological landscape as weirdly mythic as the one his camera keeps sweeping majestically across. Brad Pitts paranoid Jesse James with his easy grin and steely gaze is an oddly ideal match for Casey Afflecks needy creepy high-school-shooter of a Robert Ford. Pitt won the Best Actor award at the Venice Film Festival but its Affleck you cant take your eyes off especially once hes made up his mind to kill his hero. Once hes done that Ford has to deal with the twists that fate throws his way -- for instance a fateful gift from that hero a gun offered as an apology for being ornery and paranoid. Intriguingly in apologizing for paranoia Jesse cites not his own feelings but how hes described in news accounts. This Jesse James believes his own press -- cares about his infamy as its depicted in the media -- in a Western thats no longer behaving much like a traditional western. After the title coward kills the title outlaw (on Easter Sunday if you like your parallels non-contemporary) theres still 40 minutes of movie left. Young Bob Ford will himself become a celebrity and fame will meet infamy for one final struggle -- one that suggests a link to Greek tragedy. And while its a rare film let alone the rare Western that can support that kind of baggage Id say The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is it.

Comments The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford Moseying along for 160 minutes this 2007 revisionist western by writer-director Andrew Dominik makes a wan attempt to present the Jesse James legend as the dawn of celebrity culture in America. That thesis is strengthened by having spotlight-weary Brad Pitt play the notorious outlaw near the end of his career though the role is so opaque he doesnt have much to do besides stare murderously at the third-tier goofballs (Sam Rockwell Paul Schneider) who now constitute the James gang. The real protagonist is Robert Ford a whiny ingratiating teen who joins up brimming with dime-novel visions of glory eventually kills his idol and still finds himself defined by Jamess legend. Casey Affleck gives a spectacularly creepy performance as the seething young man whose mingled worship and resentment make him the prototype of the modern celebrity stalker. R. By J.R.

Based on Ron Hansens novel of the same name director Andrew Dominiks movie slips into local theaters today. On the surface the under-the-radar arrival of the film confounds. After all Brad Pitt inhabits the outlaws boots and furious if hard-to-fathom mind. And Pitt won the Venice Film Festivals acting prize for his turn as the Johnny Reb without many causes beyond his own violent impulses. In the late 1800s Jesse brother Frank and their gang of thieves and killers were coming to the end of their run but not their legendary status. Newspaper accounts and barroom chatter often made Jesse out to be a hero of the defeated Confederacy or a bandit in the key of Robin Hood. From its mildly self-conscious narration to the stack of James gang comics that Robert Ford stores under his bed ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" is very much about our gift for myth-making. Standing in the woods prepping for one of their last train-jackings Frank James (Sam Shepard) appears annoyed and appalled by 19-year-old Robert Fords pitch to join the inner circle. ""Ive got an appetite for greater things"" says Casey Afflecks awkward character. ""Let me be your sidekick."" Ford is Afflecks breakout role. He gives Ford a drowsy-eyed vibe. At times he appears slow-witted. Other times his eerie low-watt glimmer seems savvy. Mary-Louise Parkers gifts are nearly wasted playing Jesses wife. But she does convey her characters intuitive suspicion that theres something not quite healthy about Fords puppy-dog attention to her hubby. Sure there are soulful moments in Pitts depiction of the psychopath Jesse. He has a way of staring and speaking that feels genuine for a hot minute. But those in his increasingly rag-tag gang recognize the lethal ending implied. A scene of Jesse eliciting information from a boy in a barn underscores the notion that James wasnt just a purveyor of terror to strangers on trains he could torture too. Even Frank no sweetheart knew when to quit him. Jesse is sullen and paranoid. (Think of when Robert DeNiros character begins deleting his crew in ""Goodfellas."") Sam Rockwell is fine fun as Charlie Robert Fords rightly scared older brother. Over-identification and competition fuel Fords interest in Jesse. And Jesse feels himself misunderstood just enough to be intrigued by Fords fawning grasp of him. Someone could make a parody of their relationship using another incisive film about over-identification and ambition ""All About Robert."" Indeed Ford does wind up on the New York stage. As if to prove a point that without Jesse Robert wasnt much the films measured pace quickens. And the movie rushes toward its conclusion one that finds Ford running a saloon in Creede Colo. and keeping company with a showgirl (Zooey Deschanel). Last year much was written about Sofia Coppolas ""Marie Antoinette"" as an allegory of modern Los Angeles. That may be. But shot by Roger Deakins and scored by Nick Cave ""Assassination"" is just as stunning. And its ideas about the wages of celebrity worship are sharper. The films muted release is really too bad. This brooding beauty deserves heralding. Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" R for language and a scene of graphic violence. 2 hours 40 minutes.

Starring Brad Pitt Casey Affleck Sam Shepard Sam Rockwell and Paul Schneider. Directed by Andrew Dominik. (R. 160 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Who would have imagined that a biopic about Jesse James could be so boring? The outlaw started out as a Confederacy guerrilla fighter and had a shootout-filled career as a bank train and stagecoach robber. He became a folk hero and remains a pop culture sensation the subject of more than 10 movies a ""Twilight Zone"" episode and even an appearance on ""The Brady Bunch."" ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" covers almost none of the above instead focusing on his final months and then his death at the hand of Ford a late addition to the outlaws gang. As a piece of visual art the movie is frequently impressive. But as a piece of popular entertainment its ponderous repetitive and lacking a single rousing action sequence. Your chances of staying awake are better during a Beatrix Potter biopic. ""Assassination"" will polarize audiences and there will be a few hard-core cinemaphiles who declare this the best picture of the year (fans of Terrence Malicks ""The New World"" and Jim Jarmuschs ""Dead Man"" you know who you are). But for every filmgoer who cherishes the languid pace and Nick Caves moody musical score there will probably be 10 who go to the film expecting something closer to ""Silverado"" and feel supremely disappointed. This movie features ""12 Monkeys"" Brad Pitt not ""Oceans 13"" Brad Pitt. In other words Middle America is going to be mad. ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" (its titles like these that make staff writers wish they were paid by the word) begins with the James Gang preparing for its final train robbery. Their longtime buddies from the Younger family have all been captured or killed and the James boys have collected a few stray cousins and some riffraff from the hills to help their cause. A rift between Jesse and Frank (Sam Shepard always good but way too creaky to play Pitts three-years-older brother) leaves Jesse spending time with a group of unknowns including Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) who harbors a wicked man crush for the outlaw. With a hefty price on James head the gang begins to fester with mistrust shifting alliances and eventually self-destruction. If that sounds like a rollicking good time at the movies then please accept my apologies and a free ticket to ""310 to Yuma."" The movie does have some good qualities with raw tension in almost every scene and a portrayal of James that is admirable in its lack of embellishment. And even when this action slows to a crawl at least the cinematography is fantastic. Falling snow hasnt looked this awesome since that Charlie Brown television Christmas special. ""Assassination"" was written and directed by Andrew Dominik who covered similar material in the excellent 2000 film ""Chopper."" Dominik has lost none of his keen eye for quiet tension-filled verbal exchanges creative use of natural light and realistic violence. The difference is time ""Chopper"" was 94 minutes long and ""Assassination"" clocks in at two hours 40 minutes. That extra hour and six minutes does almost no one any good particularly Pitt as James and Affleck as Ford. Pitts offscreen antics with Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie have actually been his secret weapon. Just when you start to see him as nothing but paparazzi man-candy hell sucker-punch you with an irresistible action movie role such as ""Troy"" or an offbeat character performance in a movie such as ""Snatch."" But he seems lost at times here neither menacing nor particularly tragic. Affleck has different problems. His interpretation of Ford is so unnerving and essentially useless that its impossible to understand not only why James keeps him around but how he could survive in the Wild West. Even worse Afflecks physical features and mannerisms are a dead ringer for those of John Mark Karr that creepy guy who claimed he killed JonBenet Ramsey and then gleefully milked the publicity. (Its an unfortunate coincidence - the movie was shot in 2005 a year before Karr surfaced.) The best exchanges come between the lesser characters including Jeremy Renner as a frustrated cousin of Jesse James and Paul Schneider as a too-clever-for-his-own-good lothario. Dominik is a strong writer who gives even the lesser characters an impressive amount of depth. There are four significant female characters in the movie each with just a few lines but they all have their own distinct personalities. Also surprisingly good in a short cameo is James Carville (yes that James Carville) who shows up as Missouri Gov. Thomas T. Crittenden who was a vital player in the plot to bring down Jesse James. It wasnt too much of a stretch. Crittenden was a Democrat. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations violence and absolutely no mercy for filmgoers with small bladders.

"Jesse turns an outlaw into high art - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review Jesse turns an outlaw into high art Brad Pitt (left as the outlaw) and Casey Affleck star in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford."" (Kimberly French/Warner Brothers Pictures) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 5 2007 As you might expect from something called ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" brevity is not a virtue here. The movie dreamily conjures up the outlaws last months and its gorgeous but long cumbersome and slightly shallow. In its next life it deserves to come back as one of those Taschen art books that never leaves the coffee table heavy art.The writer and director Andrew Dominik aims to use the Jesse James myth circa 1881 and 1882 Missouri to contemplate modern mythmaking. And if youre up for doing some serious intellectual squinting you might even see an allegory for meta-celebrity worship since Brad Pitt plays James and a variety-pack of somewhat younger less globally famous actors - Casey Affleck Sam Rockwell Paul Schneider Jeremy Renner and Garret Dillahunt - play the adoring dudes in his posse. The early narrative event involves Jamess final train robbery. The ensuing drama is over whether the bounty for his capture or murder is too lucrative and too star-making to keep his apostles loyal.Getting to the assassination of the title requires a stupendously excessive drift from point A to point B during which Dominik demonstrates all he learned on his stint a few years ago as a second-unit director for ""The New World"" Terrence Malicks retelling of the John Smith-Pocahontas relationship. Malick displaced the story of the civilized world onto that love affair and the movie was a wonder a perfect balance of moral sadness and aesthetic exploration. Ponderousness hung over the movie just as it did in Malicks ecologys-eye-view of World War II ""The Thin Red Line."" Dominik doesnt quite have Malicks control of the weather. His movie is mostly ponderous despite the unceasingly beautiful imagery (the great Roger Deakins did the cinematography; Curtiss Clayton and Dylan Tichenor edited the film).FAMOUS WESTERNS See a photo gallery of other Western film classics at boston.com/films.Or maybe its ponderous because of the imagery The style doesnt add up to anything bigger. The approach of a trains headlights in a pitch-black forest is like dawn by Thomas Edison. There are shots of empty chairs swaying treetops agitated skies. The film has a narrator Hugh Ross and his intonations are married to composed images whose edges blur but whose centers are sharply focused. Its like watching something through thick glass. ""The Assassination of Jesse James"" has an accompanying thickly sullen atmosphere - the joshing antics and banter among the James boys their priapic names (Dick Liddil Wood Hite) bring some levity. (Mary Louise Parker Alison Elliott and Zooey Deschanel are on hand as half-hearted proof that women existed.) The sequences among the men come off so easily in fact that you wonder why Dominik bothered to construct a movie with such a poker face or devoted this much seriousness to iconography that isnt that compelling. This could be Jesse James playing Brad Pitt in ""Oceans Whatever."" It could be Jesse James as Jesus Christ surrounded by a band of acolytes and turncoats. Pitts characterization is interesting insofar as he doesnt appear to be playing a character. He broods grins and looks fetching in all of Patricia Norriss period costumes. If the movie doubles as a portrait of the actor Dominik picks up on why Pitt is a movie star He makes not acting look easy. But as a subject for allegory Pitt is too opaque to reward scrutiny even if some of the narration adapted from Ron Hansens impressionistic novel seems dead-on. (""Rooms were hotter when he walked into them"" goes one line.) The narration actually contributes a florid but forensic accounting. We learn a lot about what James did without lifting the veil on who he was.If the movie truly is about the lust for fame only the last 30 or so minutes after Robert Ford pulls the trigger bring out the best in Dominiks idea. Casey Affleck plays Ford and his presence in the picture turns less peripheral as the film unfolds. There is time to study the uncanny smoothness of his face and the adolescent awkwardness in his manner so that when the moment comes for Affleck to take the literal stage as a legend-killer (Ford cast himself and his brother Charlie whom Sam Rockwell plays in theatrical reenactments of the murder) hes mesmerizing since his charisma seemed like a closely kept secret.The metaphor of Affleck slaying Pitt is pure Hollywood but its compelling since in this movie Affleck appears to want us to know hes not content to play Robin to everyone elses Batman. And the movie turns into what it should have been all along a dual character study of Bob and Charlie. Youre not entirely sure why the film doesnt work until suddenly it does. The last act is sinister surreal sad and sharply acted. It also uses all the formal flourishes to advance a more hot-blooded story of a surprisingly cold-blooded man. Dominik should have just borrowed the title and length of Sam Fullers 81-minute first movie and called his film ""I Shot Jesse James"" then told it in reverse. Otherwise the movie is a pumpkin that takes too long to get carved into a jack-o-lantern.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog.

Its title for one thing. Its duration - two hours and 40 minutes - for another.But mostly its excruciatingly deliberate pace makes you wonder if Andrew Dominiks film as spare as it is self-important intentionally unfolds in narrative slow-mo.On the plus side Brad Pitts turn as the fastest (and most paranoid) gun in the West and that of Casey Affleck as James starstruck fan and killer are sharp. Both are blunted and befogged by the films atmospherics and glacial pace.The movies texture resembles that of a daguerreotype - metallic monochrome symmetrically framed and a little fuzzy around the edges. Cinematographer Roger Deakins artist among lensmen approximates a 19th-century means of telling the 19th-century story and it is striking.Yet the visuals are so epically scaled for this intimate story that they overwhelm what is a portrait of two men. Inspired by the 1983 novel by Ron Hansen the film about outlaw and sidekick means to be an inquiry into the relations between celebrity and fan - or in Dominiks retelling the prairie Jesus and Judas.It was said about James outlaw-legend that he was ""utterly devoid of fear and with no more compunction about cold-blooded murder than he has about eating breakfast."" Pitt is a study in magnetism and repulsion drawing the ragtag Ford brothers Charley (Sam Rockwell) and Robert (Affleck) into his orbit and then scaring the bejesus out of them to keep them in line.The film opens at the time of the James Gangs final train robbery when Jesses elder brother Frank (Sam Shepard) outright rejects the young Robert because the sycophant with the nervous whimper and battered bowler gives him ""the willies.""Yet Jesse on the eve of the Gangs breakup is looking for a new band of brothers. He eyes Robert - his number-one fan and collector of every dime novel about his exploits - as a vain man might a mirror. ""Want to be like me or want to be me?"" demands Jesse of Robert.Though Jesse gets first billing in the title this is a movie about Robert the man without his own identity the moon reflecting Jesses sun. In suggesting Roberts callowness Affleck delivers an eerily profound performance as shifty-eyed and unpredictable as Pitts Jesse. In a small role as a gang defector Paul Schneider likewise makes a big impression.The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford  (out of four stars) Written and directed by Andrew Dominik.

By Anthony Lane Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner as F.B.I. agents in Peter Bergs movie.   Credit TOM BACHTELL No film whose closing credits list a ""senior inferno artist"" is likely to lull us with its tranquil charms and ""The Kingdom"" is a thumper of a movie full of furious souls. The kingdom in question is Saudi Arabia and before the story gets under way we are treated to a potted history of that countrys birth gushing wealth and political machinations. The scene then narrows to an American compound near Riyadh--a miniature America in fact with the families of oil workers enjoying a ballgame and a barbecue. The compound comes under a series of staggered attacks with the director Peter Berg cleverly allowing us to think the worst is over before slamming us with something even worse. A team of F.B.I. investigators flies in to survey the devastation interview witnesses and nail the culprits the implication being that the Saudis themselves--some of whose law-enforcement personnel were among the victims--are not up to the job. The team consists of Ron Fleury (Jamie Foxx) Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner) Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper) and someone named Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman) although I must admit that I kept forgetting who he was and why he was there. As for Mayes the biggest mystery in the film concerns the dispatching of a female agent to an Arab land. When the Saudi prince in charge of security turns up to inspect the scene of the atrocity the local State Department official Damon Schmidt (Jeremy Piven) takes one look at Mayess breasts beneath her olive-green T-shirt and says ""We need to cover these situations."" More improbable still Mayes is a forensic specialist whose task is to examine corpses so one has to ask if the F.B.I. is so smart why did they send her to a place where according to this movie at any rate she is forbidden to touch the Muslim bodies? The answer is that Bergs film is driven not by logic but by simple needling. Like his heroes he doesnt particularly want to understand the Saudis or get along with them or play by their arcane rules. He just wants to get in their face. As ""The Kingdom"" progresses the role of the F.B.I. squad begins to inflate. At first under the guiding hand of the local investigator Colonel Faris Al Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom) the agents are largely confined to their quarters and barely permitted to disturb the crime scene. As the rules relax the film turns into ""C.S.I. Riyadh"" with Sykes fishing around in bomb craters for twisted clues and by the end the fantastic four--heavily and inexplicably armed despite having been stripped of all weapons when they arrived--are up to their ears in a mad percussive firefight in a militant patch of the city dodging rocket-propelled grenades kicking down doors and generally shooting anything that doesnt speak English. Anything adult that is ""The Kingdom"" written by Matthew Michael Carnahan is one of those violent jaw-jutting films which like to signal a softer side every now and then by stooping down to address the anxieties of children. At home the kindly Ghazi is seen cuddling his offspring thus setting up a symmetry with Fleury who at the beginning of the film back in Washington soothes his young son. ""There are a lot of bad guys out there"" the kid says. ""But you aint one of them"" Fleury replies. The trouble with Bergs film is not hard to pin down. Since he made a sour little black comedy called ""Very Bad Things"" in 1998 he has become adept at the marshalling of multiple figures and the boom and stutter of the action sequences in the new film--whether on the freeway or in the claustrophobic back alleys of Riyadh--leaves you thoroughly winded and wiped. Even in the midst of that response however you realize that what whips up the melee is vengefulness. This is not to be confused with justice; the film has nothing but contempt for the traditional methods of diplomacy and international law and the true villains of the piece are not the terrorists whose patient bombmaking we watch in horrified detail but Schmidt the sweating wimp from the State Department who is nauseated by the sight of blood and even more heinous the U.S. Attorney General (Danny Huston) with his quibbling reluctance to unleash the F.B.I. on foreign soil. There is a mischievous moment early in the plot when Fleury basically blackmails his way into Saudi Arabia. Meeting in secret with the Saudi Ambassador to the United States he announces that if he and his team cannot proceed with their mission he will authorize the leaking of a financial scandal linking Saudi nobility to terrorist funding. And the leak he adds will travel way beyond D.C. into the heartland to places like Terrell Texas. In other words Fleury is reaching over the Ambassadors head and over the Beltway and appealing directly to the indignation of the common man. If Frank Capra had ever made a Rambo movie it would have looked like this. The cunning extends to the casting. Instead of Sylvester Stallone we get Jamie Foxx still trailing clouds of Ray Charles. His sly slurring manner is never more than an inch away from the comic and because he is so unmilitary in his bearing some of the sting is taken out of the mayhem he wreaks. Only Chris Cooper looks as if he knew what he was doing and his laconic middle-aged routine comes as a welcome emollient informed by Ghazi halfway through the shootout that they have strayed into a bad neighborhood he replies ""Yeah no shit"" his features as calm as the head on a coin. As for Jennifer Garner she will not I suspect gaze back on ""The Kingdom"" as her happiest hour. When Mayes is first told of the assault on the compound she slumps into disbelieving grief although her nose-wrinkling expression is more suggestive of a plumber sniffing your property for blocked drains. Still she cheers up relishing her opportunity not merely to see the sights of Saudi Arabia but whilst there to stab a knife into the groin of a terrorist. This is what is known as symbolism although it does leave you wondering what sort of overheated havoc she Fleury and the others will leave behind as they fly home. Could it be that the tension between East and West and thus the potential for yet more destructive payback is even more pronounced than when they arrived? It is no mean feat to make a boring film about Jesse James but Andrew Dominik has pulled it off in style. The style in question is one of undeniable beauty searching and languorous with a palette of tweed-browns grays and dirty whites touched here and there by the bright nickel of a pistol. The director of photography Roger Deakins has devised a trick of keeping the center of the frame cleanly in focus while the rest of it slides away in a blur. We might as well be peering through a pinhole camera and at first sight this glance at the photographic manner of the period is perfectly judged; after it has been used a dozen times however it lapses into a mannerism. We are mostly in Missouri in the eighteen-eighties as some of the wildness is draining from the West and as Jesse James (Brad Pitt) is already rising above the brute facts of his existence--he was a multiple murderer as well as an uncommon thief--and ascending to the status of myth. ""All America thinks highly of me"" he says and his No. 1 fan is a nineteen-year-old named Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) who keeps a stash of Jesse James storybooks under his bed. In fact James is at the butt end of his career. We see him and his brother Frank (Sam Shepard) rob a train at night (Jesse is nobly silhouetted against the billowing steam as if in a student production of ""Godspell"") but that is their last job together and from here on the wanted man is a wanderer. Somehow Robert and his brother Charley (Sam Rockwell) oil their way into Jesses presence if not his affections. Why he should have humored them--Robert to judge from Afflecks portrayal was a cross between a scallywag and a creep--is anyones guess but he did and he paid the price. The movie is called ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" and the arch give-it-all-away sobriety of the title warns you to brace yourself for deconstruction. And so it proves. Dominik who both wrote and directed the film cannot resist coaching us in the finer points of his characters in case we miss something. Ford followed James a voice-over explains ""as if he were composing a biography of the outlaw or as if he were preparing an impersonation."" The interplay of the two men has its oddities as do the particulars of the killing on April 3 1882 not to mention the crazy aftermath with fifty thousand dollars offered for Jamess body as it lay on ice like a salmon. There is a good ninety-minute documentary to be made on the Jesse James cult as a firing pin of modern celebrity; but do we really need two and a half hours of slow shaggy-dog meditation on the man himself in his dull decline with all concerned acting their long johns off to fill the time? Revisionism is a fine thing but too much of it makes you long for the vision of old.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

The movie opens today.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Sept. 21 2007 Starring Brad Pitt Casey Affleck Sam Shepard Sam Rockwell Mary-Louise Parker Paul Schneider. Written and directed by Andrew Dominick. 160 minutes. At the Varsity. 14A  When this movie makes good on its title and the lost-to-legend Missouri bank robber media sensation and icon-to-be Jesse James (played by a decidedly haggard-looking Brad Pitt) is blown into folklore immortality by Casey Afflecks Bob Ford the murder feels like something foreordained.Article Continued BelowLike the stabbing of Julius Caesar the crash of James Dean and - inevitably - the betrayal of Jesus its got ritual written all over it. The most ritualistic of movie narrative forms the western has always had its own death hard-wired into its soul.No popular movie genre is more nostalgic or melancholic by nature and none is more fixated on the transcendent necessity of dying legends are born when the flesh expires.The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford the second film (after 2000s Chopper) written and directed by the 40-year-old New Zealander Andrew Dominik is like an extended death ballad an account of the final days of Jesse James that manages to breathe vitality into the western movie as a popular art form at the same time that it so magisterially administers the last rites. Based on the superb 1983 novel by Ron Hansen The Assassination of Jesse James begins with the arrival of the sadly starstruck 19-year-old Bob Ford (a fetchingly creepy and sad performance by Affleck) at the James gangs forest hideout on the eve of what will be the already famed outfits final train robbery. Coldly rebuffed by Jesses taciturn older brother Frank (Sam Shepard) and subsequently patronized by the distracted and self-possessed Jesse Ford assumes the role that will become his mythic destiny as the man who will ultimately betray the object of his wounded obsession and who will be forced to live out his remaining days as one of historys most despised and trod-upon footnotes.As Bob slowly moves toward his own uncomfortable date with destiny Afflecks performance moves through a multitude of shades of pale at first a needy wannabe desperado looking badly in need of a bar of soap Bob becomes increasingly sensitive to his status as the gangs geek pariah and resident joke.The most painful moment comes when a box full of Jesse James dime novels are found under the starstruck Bobs bed.Eventually consumed by jealousy and resentment Bob in the last act adopts a kind of deathbed serenity - like Jesse hes fully aware of how the script of his life must play out. But thats getting ahead of ourselves. After Frank departs for the east (where he will live long enough to live out the contradictions of his own legend) Jesse is left with both the scruffy remains of his gang - including Bobs brother Charley (Sam Rockwell) his cousin Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner) the bloomer-chasing Dick Liddel (Paul Schneider) and not overly intellectual Ed Miller (Garret Dillahunt) - and the demons of his own unsettled psyche.While Afflecks cipher-like Bob provides the movies romantically distorted quietly tormented point-of-view Pitt is magnetic as Jesse an intelligent but paranoid man driven into hiding by his own reputation and worn into early decline by the certainty of his own death.He never sleeps wears his gunbelts constantly and is prone to mood swings that can be terrifying in their intensity.Pitts Jesse James is a man imprisoned within his own celebrity - at one point were told Jesse is the only American Europeans know besides Mark Twain - driven virtually insane by what he has become and tortured by the peace hell never have.Overlaid with a quietly ironic narration that suggests - along with the haunting isolation of figures in Albertas vast natural spaces - the influence of Badlands Terrence Malick and shot by the estimable Roger Deakins in a manner that frequently gives the edges of the frame a prismatic quality The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is itself a movie that plays out somewhere between the realm of self-conscious myth and grimy human tragedy.Its a western destined to outlive the pronouncements of its own death because it knows that death is only the first stage in the life of legend.This is an edited version of a review which appeared during the Toronto International Film Festival.

Pitt is the latest in a long line of pretty actors - everyone from Tyrone Power to most recently Colin Farrell in ""American Outlaws"" - to play the legendary robber here seen alternately as a psychotic killer and weary bullet-scarred family man approaching both middle age and the end of his life. As the film opens in 1881 most of Jesses original band are long dead and his brother Frank (played briefly by Sam Shepard) retires after one last train robbery (which is about as exciting as this movie gets). As Frank was much smarter than Jesse the latter spends his final months hiding under an assumed identity and planning jobs that were never executed. He spends more time worrying that members of his ragtag entourage will turn him in to collect a bounty offered by the governor of Missouri (a scene-stealing cameo by James Carville). Rubbing out several of his confederates Jesse gives insufficient thought to the sycophantic Bob Ford (Casey Affleck) a stuttering 19-year-old fan of dime novels about Jesses exploits who has entered the gang on the coattails of his morose older brother Charley (Sam Rockwell). Amid more pregnant pauses than a seasons worth of Pinter and visuals practically plagiarized from Robert Altmans ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" Aussie director Andrew Dominik (""Chopper"") offers a variety of explanations for the titular act which finally occurs 132 long minutes into the movie. Besides the reward self-preservation and jealousy of Jesses celebrity the flick rather heavy-handedly suggests Bob Ford had unresolved homoerotic issues. This is most hilariously spelled out in a scene where Bob tries to engage a distracted Jesse whos taking a bath in a conversation about their being the ""same size."" This artsy adaptation of Ron Hansens 1982 book which further obscures things with hard-to-follow accents doesnt pick up even a little momentum until after Bob shoots Jesse in the back. The final half-hour is essentially a lengthy coda devoted to Bobs life afterward which began with 15 minutes of fame as he and his brother re-enacted the assassination in a traveling stage show. Charley takes his own life while Bob endures a famous ballad about ""that dirty little coward"" (performed on-screen by Nick Cave) before being shot to death by another fame-seeker. ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" has been on the shelf for a year with Warner Bros. reportedly testing as many as half a dozen different cuts to indifferent audience response. Even Pitts head-scratching best actor award at the Venice Film Festival (he basically plays Jesse as an attitudinized version of himself in a fashion layout) isnt going to help much. The events here were far more entertainingly covered by Sam Fuller in his directing debut ""I Shot Jesse James"" recently released on DVD - and its half as long to boot. lou.lumenicknypost.com THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD  1/2 They shoulda shot the director instead.

Friday September 21 2007 400 AM The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. True story of the fabled outlaws death at the hands of a disloyal gang member. With Brad Pitt Casey Affleck Sam Rockwell. Director Andrew Dominik (232). R Language violence. At area theaters. Its not exactly the movie I hoped it would be but Andrew Dominiks adaptation of Ron Hansens great historical novel ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" does something no other Jesse James movie has done It tells the truth. With Brad Pitt playing the legendary bank robber it would have been hard to shift the focus to where it belongs on the story of young gang member Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) after the title act in 1882. What consumed more than 100 pages of Hansens meticulously researched novel is summarized in the last - and best - 15 or 20 minutes of the 2 1/2-hour movie. Fords story resonates more with us today because where James fame came from his ability to elude capture his killers was derived from an obsession with fame itself. Ford was a 20-year-old groupie who begged his way into James inner circle then claimed his own legend by shooting his idol in the back of the head. It worked. The name Bob Ford was better-known to Americans than that of their President. But after some instant gratification on stages from St. Louis to Broadway demonstrating how he killed James Ford became the scourge of the West - think O.J. Simpson - and was himself assassinated a decade later. I would like to have seen the movie open with Fords life as a disgraced saloon and brothel operator in Creede Colo. then a long flashback showing the leadup to and the assassination of James and back to Creede for the ultimate comeuppance. Instead the movie fastens itself immediately to James as he puts together a new gang for one last bank robbery before retiring as the genteel family man Tom Howard. The look and feel of the movie are as authentic as any Western since Robert Altmans ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" and the performances by Pitt as the contradictory James and Affleck as the troubled overachiever who finds infamy instead of fame are dead-on. As is often the case it took a foreign director - Dominic is an Aussie - to bring an aura of realism to an intrinsically American story.

Brad Pitt in The Assassination of Jesse James The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (Warner Bros.) revolves around a piece of casting so perfect it almost amounts to a stunt. Brad Pitt is every bit the exemplar of contemporary fame (the good deeds the tabloids the paparazzi) as Jesse James was of its 19th-century version (the bad deeds the broadsheet ballads the carte-de-visite portraits). And like James Pitt retains a haunted inaccessible quality despite his absurdly overdocumented life. The mere phrase ""Brad Pitt as Jesse James"" makes for a kind of mini-reflection on the evolution of celebrity culture. Its a shame that The Assassination of Jesse James a moody epic directed by Andrew Dominik (Chopper) and based on the 1983 novel by Ron Hansen never goes much deeper than that tag line. Theres one thing Pitt and James dont have in common. Pitt is not to all appearances a barking lunatic six-person family bed notwithstanding. James was Accounts by his contemporaries stress his paranoia egocentrism and sudden fits of temper and not least a propensity for shooting former colleagues in the back at the faintest hint of treachery. Dominiks film opens in 1881 as the James brothers Jesse and his cooler-headed sibling Frank (Sam Shepard) are planning their final train robbery outside Blue Cut Mo. Bob Ford (Casey Affleck) the 19-year-old younger brother of a member of their gang shows up to beg for a role in the holdup. Frank shoos him off with a drawn pistol--a gesture that in my own job-interview history Ive always taken as a ""no."" But Bob Ford isnt the type to scare so easily. In modern terms hes a stalker a shameless hanger-on with a puppylike fixation on Jesse and a disturbing attachment to his box of James memorabilia. After the robbery Jesse keeps him around as a gofer and general whipping boy and the two establish a queasy rapport that will eventually result in the event of the title. Advertisement More than any character in cinema Bob Ford recalls Rupert Pupkin the wannabe standup comic who took Jerry Lewis hostage in The King of Comedy. And like Robert De Niro in that role Casey Affleck goes for broke in a wonderfully brave and weird performance as the craven naif Bob. Somehow he makes us want to flee this creep at top speed even as we pray no harm will come to him. Pitt is scary and charismatic as Jesse and the supporting roles are superbly cast (Sam Rockwell is indelible as Bobs brother Charlie) but the movie belongs to Affleck. In old-school Western tradition the female roles--Mary-Louise Parker as Jesses wife Zooey Deschanel as an exotic dancer who befriends Bob--are nearly nonexistent. The Assassination of Jesse James commits one of the most woeful sins of the literary adaptation way too much voice-over. The superstitious Jesse the movie tells us while showing vast prairie skies ""read auguries in the snarled intestines of chickens."" Really? Well dont just tell us about it Lets see some disemboweled fowl Ron Hansens prose as adapted by Dominik is often lovely but the scripts reliance on narration robs the film of its best opportunities to tell the story simply through images. Thanks to Roger Deakins cinematography those images are beautifully composed but a blurred-edges effect meant to evoke period photography feels contrived. Self-conscious mythmaking of the kind this movie undertakes is always a dangerous enterprise. The Western--including the postmodern twisted were-way-beyond-Westerns-now kind of Western--is a genre thats been so thoroughly explored that like the gangster movie a new one better have a damn good reason for existing. It feels strange to wish for more from a movie thats three hours long but the segment following James death in which the Ford brothers tour the country with a vaudeville re-enactment of the murder seems hurried and tacked-on. Dominik might have done well to trim some of the scenes of raunchy camaraderie among the James gang to concentrate on the enigma of the films central dyad. For all the time we spend in their company we leave with little sense of what Bob and Jesses motivations are and without giving away the plot I can state that some of the choices they make are pretty bizarre. ""Do you want to be like me or do you want to be me?"" Jesse asks his worshipful tormentor at one point. What the distinction is between those two desires--or by what path either one would lead to a compulsion to kill--is a question that The Assassination of Jesse James for all its ponderousness leaves frustratingly unexplored.

Once in a while it succeeds. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor September 21 2007 Save for later Saved Sometimes movies are epics because of the largeness of their vision. Other movies strain for epic status because of the slowness of their vision. At a very measured 160 minutes ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" lays out a relatively simple yarn in what often seems like real time and the portentousness is not always indistinguishable from pretentiousness. This is a movie that very much wants to be a classic. Infuriatingly every once in a while it manages to become just that.The story begins in 1881 as Frank James (Sam Shepard) and his younger brother Jesse (Brad Pitt) prepare to stage a train robbery which as usual they pull off handily. Frank afterward decides to pack in his 14-year career as a bandit and move East into anonymity leaving Jesse to carry on with a ragtag gang that includes Bob Ford (Casey Affleck) and his brother Charley (Sam Rockwell).Even if you know nothing about Jesse James the title of the movie gives the show away. The audience is placed in a position of omniscience - we know more than Jesse does about his fate and who will deliver it. He first sizes up the callow Bob by observing matter-of-factly ""You dont have the ingredients son."" But Bob who religiously follows Jesses exploits in the dime novels of the day is so relentlessly adulatory that Jesse keeps him on as a kind of mascot. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? What Jesse despite his finely honed early warning system for danger doesnt realize is that Bobs ardor has its flip side. Hes the original obsessed fan. In his most clear-sighted moment Jesse says to Bob ""You want to be like me or you want to be me?"" Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The writer-director Andrew Dominick adapting the 1983 novel by Ron Hansen mythologizes Jesse even as he brings him into focus as a sociopath. Seemingly invincible Jesse basks in his status as a pulp icon and yet he is constantly on guard against the slightest whisper of betrayal. Hes like a prairie version of the Joe Pesci character in ""Goodfellas"" - an innocent remark by a cohort inspires waves of paranoia. His greatest passion is for methodically hunting down those who have moved against him and so there is a kind of black comedy in watching him steer his gang. No one knows when this grinning maestro will lash out. His gang goes to ridiculous lengths to placate him; they would rather be humiliated than dead.Dominick and his cinematographer Roger Deakins frame the story in expansive tableaux that capture the mournfulness of the wide-open spaces. Equal attention is paid to the aural environment This is the kind of movie where you hear every cricket. The films narration also comes with its surfeit of grandeur. Jesse is described thusly ""Rooms seemed hotter when he was in them rain fell straighter clocks slowed.""(Its not only when Jesse James is around that the clocks seem slow.)Easing into the comforts of vice chomping an expensive stogie Pitts Jesse sometimes appears to be posing for the cover of Cigar Aficionado magazine. But Pitt is the best reason to see this movie. All his years of being a celebrity in the eye of the storm have no doubt worked to his advantage here. When Paul Newman played Buffalo Bill in Robert Altmans ""Buffalo Bill and the Indians"" he emphasized the yawning gap between the dime-book legend and the actual ordinary man. Pitt convincingly incarnates the Jesse James legend while at the same time subverting it. Jesses hair-trigger psychosis is not what we expect - not even from our antiheroes.And yet Dominick understands that Jesse will forever rise above his killer in the public imagination. Affleck does a meticulous job of portraying Bob as a craven idolator. The fact that his killing of Jesse is inevitable does not detract from its power - it may in fact be the source of its power.I wish this movie wasnt so purposefully elegiac and attenuated - at times its like a middling Terrence Malick fantasia - but its well worth sitting through.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; assassination-of-jesse-james-by-the-coward-robert-ford-the ) Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford The (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli One of the longest films of the fall (both in terms of title length and running length) is The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. It seems every bit as long or longer than its 160 minutes. Parts of the movie are brilliant in a Terrence Malick-inspired way but the lugubrious middle section is badly in need of the hand of a ruthless editor. The Assassination of Jesse James starts and finishes strong but it will lose numerous viewers during a frustrating meandering middle section that spends so much time fleshing out secondary characters that it often forgets about the title individuals. Ironically itas the movieas half-hour coda that contains the most compelling material - material that often feels rushed and truncated. One of the aspects of the life (and death) of famed outlaw Jesse James (Brad Pitt) addressed by this overblown drama is the way in which celebrity can take on a life of its own. Viewed in a cold hard light James (Brad Pitt) was a thief and a killer. However even in his day myth had overtaken reality. He was seen as a dashing Robin Hood type who was vaunted in some quarters as a hero. Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) found this out the hard way when he killed James. His initial expectation was that he would be greeted worldwide by thunderous applause. The reaction was quite different. After a period of curiosity public opinion turned against him. The filmas title in which he is referred to as aThe Coward Robert Forda reflects this. The first half-hour of The Assassination of Jesse James is great stuff. Itas September 7 1881 and a train robbery is about to occur. James is 34 years old. This will be the final act of crime in a twelve year span for the James Gang and will become known to history as the Blue Cut Train Robbery. Jesse and his older brother Frank (Sam Shepard) still run the gang but all of the other original members are either dead or in prison. So accompanying them on this robbery are a bunch of locals. Robert Ford is among them. Hes a huge fan of James having idolized him since his youth. He also appears ill-equipped to be an outlaw. Frank says to him ""You donat have the ingredients Son."" Nevertheless he worms himself into Jesseas trust and becomes an off-again/on-again companion until the day when an act half driven by fear and half by avarice leads him down the road to infamy. The problem with the film is that the section bookended by the train robbery and Jesseas death is ponderous. It concentrates on lesser characters who arent especially interesting. Character development during this period for both Jesse and Robert is uneven. Throughout Ford remains an enigma. How he became transformed from Jesseas biggest fan to a man who viewed him with envy and jealousy is never effectively conveyed. By spending so much time with individuals who capture neither our interest nor our sympathy director Andrew Dominikas film veers off track. He gets it back on the rails before it rushes into the station for the ending and extended epilogue but not before a lot of time has seemingly been wasted. The film has three undeniable strengths. The acting especially by Brad Pitt as a world-weary Jesse and Casey Affleck as the increasingly bitter Robert is excellent. Stepping away from his superstar image Pitt recalls the days of his early career when as a character actor he earned raves and Affleck buries himself in the role. Support is provided by Sam Shepard as Frank (whoas only in about the first 30 minutes); Mary-Louise Parker as Jesseas wife; and Zoey Deschanel in a small-but-critical part as Robertas late-film love interest. Vying with the acting for top honors is the filmas cinematography credited to the veteran Roger Deakins. His landscape shots of the open plains of Missouri are astounding and there are countless breathtaking visual compositions throughout. Finally in a departure from the norm the voiceover narrative is informative clever and intelligent. It adds to the filmas structure rather than being redundant and extraneous. The Assassination of Jesse James is too long. It wants to play like a sprawling novel that provides insight into all of the characters not just the main ones. But films are not novels and this approach encourages viewer apathy. Also curious is that the most intriguing material in the movie - the way that public opinion toward Ford changes after Jamesa assassination - is given short shrift. Thatas when the movie comes alive and becomes vital. Thatas also when it ends. As Westerns go this feels like the kind of thing Terrence Malick might produce if his creative powers were ebbing. Itas far less engaging than the recent 310 to Yuma remake and concentrates more on the details than the broad picture. Thereas a place for this sort of thing in the genre but The Assassination of Jesse James is too protracted and oblique to represent it effectively.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr D The Assassination of Jesse James Genre Western Drama; Starring Casey Affleck Brad Pitt Zooey Deschanel; Director Andrew Dominik; Author Andrew Dominik; Release Date Limited 09/21/2007; Runtime (in minutes) 160; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted September 19 2007 -- 1200 AM EDT The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford -- a haunting retelling of one of the enduring outlaw sagas in American culture -- is shot by the brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins in a wide-open geography of moody skies and fields plaintive with bent light and shadow. Yet the psychological heart of the matter is dark secretive and daringly interior. This masterful Western by New Zealand filmmaker Andrew Dominik (Chopper) based on the 1983 book by Ron Hansen dips into the genre-bending influences of wild-card Westerns from the late 60s and 70s like Bonnie and Clyde and Days of Heaven for its elegiacally fatalistic tone. Yet the picture emerges with something very much plaguing the 21st century on its mind -- a cool acceptance of lethal paranoia as the natural state brought on by the weight of too much legend building and the warp of too much unrequited fandom. The charismatic bank-robbing gunslinging James after all was shot in the back by a puny would-be tagalong who claimed to be the gang leaders biggest fan and this is one rueful recounting of how it all went down. Stories about the loneliness of celebrity and the dangers of firearms rarely get starker or more mesmerizing than that. Brad Pitt plays James with a tired-eyed authoritative understanding of fames traps (he won the acting prize at the Venice Film Festival for his work) and a revelatory Casey Affleck brings Ford to life with a mature sense of an underlings craven fawning petulance. But so true to its own lights is Dominiks artful creation that all the actors (the sterling cast includes a fine Sam Rockwell as Fords brother Sam Shepard as Jesses older brother and Mary-Louise Parker as Jesses wife) fit effortlessly into the larger narrative landscape none too big for their britches. The nervy style of this newfangled Western with its eerie insinuating score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is so effective that long after Pitt and Affleck have left the screen emotional disturbance lingers like gun smoke.

Its a magnificent throwback to a time when filmmakers found all sorts of ways to refashion Hollywoods oldest and most durable genre. Given the narrower current notion of what constitutes an acceptable commercial feature Andrew Dominiks daring high-wire act will trod a very hard road to find secure theatrical footing which suggests Warner Bros. might do best to nurture it in a small number of theaters in the hope that critical support and word of mouth will snowball into long runs and a slow rollout. Whether it directly resembles them or not this impeccable new picture is at one with the adventurous spirit that produced such films as ""McCabe amp; Mrs. Miller"" ""Pat Garrett amp; Billy the Kid"" ""Bad Company"" ""The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid"" ""Jeremiah Johnson"" ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" ""Days of Heaven"" ""The Long Riders"" and yes ""Heavens Gate"" rather than with anything being made today. Shot two years ago and long delayed in editing pic marks an enormous advance for Dominik beyond his 2000 Aussie prison crimer ""Chopper."" Elegant artful and consumed by a fascination with American history and Western lore his adaptation of Ron Hansens popular 1983 novel retills the once overworked ground of outlaw legend so thoroughly that it has become fertile once again. Pics hefty 160-minute running time will no doubt cause carping in some quarters but this is one film whose length seems absolutely right for what its doing. Meticulously noting dates and locations and framing the storys long arc with discreetly distanced narration yarn commences on Sept. 5 1881 just prior to the last train robbery pulled off by the James gang in their 14-year career . After this spectacularly staged nocturnal job the older surviving brother Frank (Sam Shepard) calls it quits and disappears back East leaving Jesse (Brad Pitt) whos 34 to continue with the help of dubious lowlifes such as the Ford boys. Most questionable member of the latter clan is 19-year-old Robert (Casey Affleck) whose wimpy demeanor thin unemphatic voice and irritatingly sycophantic manner mark him as a singularly unpromising gunslinger. But even when Jesse returns to his life with wife and children under the alias of Thomas Howard he cant quite bring himself to get rid of Bob a leech who has collected every dime novel written about his hero. Jesse is both appalled and amused  at one point taunting Bob with the question ""You want to be like me or you want to be me?"" Although arrestingly different from the outset pic initially feels over-elaborated; shots in which the edges are purposely blurred and a soundtrack too conspicuously mixed to emphasize ambient sounds of insects and weather warn of incipient pretension. Fears also gather that Dominik has no intention of supplying the film with enough dramatic traction to sustain interest over the long haul as the deliberate pacing seems designed to accommodate numerous embellishments and digressions. But any sense of viewer impatience is soon overtaken by the films accumulation of detail on every front -- narrative historical folkloric behavioral and psychological. Pitching the dialogue in a way that neatly injects prairie twang with a literary lyricism Dominik settles into an expansive narrative strategy of the sort often found in novels and longform series wherein the story skips and meanders among events whose relevance and meaning may be initially unclear but which are all there for good reasons. While Jesse cools his heels and smokes his big cigars at home attention shifts to cohorts Charley Ford (Sam Rockwell) Bobs grinning older brother; Jesses cousin the homely Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner) and Dick Liddil (Paul Schneider) a self-styled ladies man . Jesses shadow hovers over them all and narratives dominant ploy is that the other characters are constantly afraid that Jesse no matter where he is will find out about any transgressions on their part and will come after them. Which in fact he does. Intensely aware of his legendary status and willing to play it up when it suits him especially with the worshipful Bob this Jesse James is both paranoid that everyones out to get himand resigned to the fact that his days are numbered. His antennae for sensing when something is amiss are almost supernaturally acute and he takes more than one long journey to track down people plotting against him . The irony is that the man he really needs to have his eye on is the one closest to him. Eventually the long-ineffectual authorities get into the act setting in place the mechanism leading to Bob Fords almost ritual killing of Jesse as he dusts a picture frame in his house. But thats not all as the final half-hour provides its own fascination in playing out the strange fate of the man whose fame came with its own curse. At least as conceived here Jesse James is the biggest celebrity in the land and Pitt generously endows the character with the droit de signeur he switches on at will. Thesp emphasizes Jesses mercurial nature but in a way that suggests much of it is calculated a strategy that until the end he uses to manipulate events . Its a layered continually interesting performance. Affleck makes an indelible impression as the insecure physically unprepossessing weakling who endures no end of humiliation and eventually embodies the sort of nobody who has bloodied American history from time to time to insure his own immortality. Rockwells effectively drawn Charley Ford is weak but in a different way than his brother always ducking to stay out of trouble and hes a good foil for the other more withdrawn rural men. Supporting turns are vivid all around including a vibrant cameo by political strategist James Carville as a big-shot governor. Even those who resist the film itself will be in awe of its surpassing visual beauty and consummate craftsmanship. Just when it seemed that cinematographer Roger Deakins had achieved another career high with ""No Country for Old Men"" he trumps himself yet again here using a subdued palette of parched-plains earth tones captured with an extraordinary luminosity and delicacy.
