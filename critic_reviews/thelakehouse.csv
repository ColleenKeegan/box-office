So he writes back. But the woman is just as puzzled as he is -- especially by the date on his letter. ""Its 2006. It has been all year. Just ask anybody"" she tells him. Chin-Scratchers Playing with time and words evidently sends hands to the jaw Will Shortz puzzle editor for The New York Times. OMalley Creardon hide caption toggle caption OMalley Creardon A mystical lake house links Sandra Bullock to Keanu Reeves. Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. ""2006"" he chokes. See hes living in 2004 and they have -- heaven help us -- a magical mailbox. This being a romance thats both a boon and a problem. Once they stop sparring our two lovebirds cant just get together tomorrow night because ""tomorrow"" for her is two years away for him. But they do have their letters and that mailbox and some pretty convoluted plot twists to keep them company as they bob like corks on a stormy sea of time... or something. The Lake House based on a Korean picture and directed by an Argentinean features supporting players with a variety of intriguing accents and its tempting to say that somethings getting lost in translation except that we are after all in the Twilight Zone here and all those different influences are more interesting than the leads are. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are attractive enough but theyre almost never on screen together so theres not much of a chance to see any chemistry between them. Still the plot if you dont question it too closely does sort of parse even when it doesnt make sense. So if youre willing to indulge a sappiness factor thats off-the-charts and you dont mind movies that just sort of tread water The Lake House may be your kind of time-waster. Personally I prefer playing with words and who better to do that with than a guy whose name is Shortz with a ""z."" Will Shortz who is NPRs puzzle guy on Weekend Edition Sunday and who has a day-job as crossword puzzle editor at The New York Times is our guide in Wordplay to a pastime that occupies some 50 million Americans every week including some reasonably famous folks -- from former presidents to Comedy Central newscasters. Filmmaker Patrick Creadon spends the first half of Wordplay not just with celebrity puzzleholics but also with the puzzleheads who ""construct"" puzzles... even while driving down the highway. In the films second half the focus shifts to the Annual Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford Conn. where computer graphics snappy editing and the decidedly odd personalities on display lend considerable tension. Admittedly the geek factor in Wordplay is every bit as high as the sap factor is in The Lake House. But if the choice is between a redesign of time or pitting nerds against words Id say make time for the nerds.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

But rather than father and son these time-travellers are potential lovers. Doctor Sarah (Sandra Bullock) starts using the letterbox of her old Lake House to correspond with the new occupant architect Alex (Keanu Reeves). But Alex insists that its 2004 not 2006 and soon an initially sceptical Sarah must accept the fact that they are two years apart in time. Striking up a friendship the penpals become closer and Alex faces the tricky prospect of romancing a woman who is two years into his future (planting trees outside her apartment and writing graffiti on a wall are just two of his little tricks).Like the apparitions in Ghost and Just Like Heaven the time difference provides an entertaining and suspenseful obstacle to romance. Fans of the Back to the Future series may also enjoy the encounters the pair have in Sarahs past and Alexs present in which Alex attempts to alter the future while Sarah has no idea who he is. But the central concept is also this films greatest weakness. Plot holes abound how can a successful architect be so hard to find in the internet age? Why can Sarah attach a book to one of her letters but Alex not? And so on. The Lake House demands a serious suspension of disbelief but if you accept it as a romantic bit of nonsense it has its pleasures.

Hes living in 2004 shes in 2006. Its like a bi-coastal relationship during an airline strike or a seventh-grader going gaga over a ninth grader but even worse because Alex and Kate can never see or touch each other although they occupy the same house and get to know one another through letters left in a magic mailbox. Still Kates mother is unfazed -- the ""time thing"" she says is ""just a detail"" -- and Kates dog trots freely between past and future. Dont ask how since nothing stands up to scrutiny -- least of all the lethargic acting and the clumsy script. I was hot to trot for the exit halfway through but a dogged sense of duty kept me stuck in an endless present. ENLARGE The movie directed by the Argentinean filmmaker Alejandro Agresti is based on a six-year-old Korean film ""Siworae"" thats also known as ""Il Mare."" In keeping with the Italian title the house in the original version sat on a romantic fog-swept beach overlooking the sea. Why then would the producers of the remake want to change the setting to a lake near Chicago thereby losing what the sea conferred on the story -- a sense of timelessness vastness and mystery? (Il Mare is now the name of a trendy fish restaurant in downtown Chicago where much of the action takes place.) Thats only one of many cockeyed decisions that went into the upsizing and downgrading of a fragile fable. In the Korean film which was made with affecting simplicity two beautiful lonely young people discover the time disjuncture struggle to understand it then manage to touch each others souls through their letters which they deposit in the beach houses antique mailbox. (Its really an epistolary romance; the intensity of their yearning is what makes the time gimmick work.) The movies tone is rueful even meditative and its visual style is lush; the camera dotes on the lovers faces when it isnt peering through opalescent mists. But simplicity is the first victim of star vehicles in todays Hollywood and ""The Lake House"" is nothing if not a star vehicle. (Its also a seven-wheeled vehicle; the credits list that many producers.) Thus Kate has become a physician with a demanding practice as well as an obtuse mother. Alex a frustrated architect has been equipped with an acute father complex; its his domineering old man a famous architect played by Christopher Plummer who built the lake house in the first place. (Dad talks sententious talk about capturing the light ""Always the light. Always."") The cinematography is variable at best though the lovers are now able to talk to one another on split screens. Jane Austen is brought in for borrowed power; Kate and Alex share a love of Austens novel ""Persuasion."" (Its about waiting"" Kate explains helpfully.) And the flag on the mailbox now a standard suburban model moves mysteriously and ridiculously whenever Kate invisible to Alex or Alex invisible to Kate deposits a letter. Its a red flag of course and you should heed it. ""The Fast amp; the Furious Tokyo Drift"" In ""The Fast amp; The Furious Tokyo Drift"" real race cars carry on like cartoons -- watch out Pixar theyre coming after you -- and cartoon characters come off as real people. By all thats unholy this third edition of the high-emission franchise should have been at least as awful as the second one was. (The first one was good fun.) Yet its surprisingly entertaining in its deafening fashion despite the absence of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker the co-stars of parts one and two. Street racing has given way to the spectacular sport of drifting -- cars skidding around like ice skaters without the ice -- and Diesels gleeful outlaw driver has been replaced by a new vroom-vrooming hero a troubled kid from Texas Sean Boswell (Lucas Black) who makes good as a loner in Tokyo while doing extremely well on Japans winding roads. ENLARGE The road to Tokyo Race cars in The Fast amp; the Furious Tokyo Drift ""Tokyo Drift"" was directed by Justin Lin from a script by Chris Morgan thats actually thoughtful when its dialogue isnt being drowned out by the din of engines. Several years ago Mr. Lin made a promising debut feature ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" a coming-of-age story about Chinese-American high school kids falling afoul of prosperity in Southern Californias Orange County. Now the director has put a distinctive stamp on his new one. Its quite striking how much human content hes been able to bring to the story which after all is mainly about slip-sliding metal accompanied by heavy metal. (The races are impressive though theyre shot and edited with a music video sensibility -- peak moments in feverish close-ups but little sense of the overall flow.) Mr. Black gives an appealing nuanced performance as Sean the misunderstood hero seeking acceptance in a slightly surreal Japanese version of the high school scene. (Seans Tokyo sidekick who might as well be part of the L.A. high school scene is played by the young rapper Bow Wow.) Nathalie Kelley is charming as Neela a good bad girl with a weakness for fast cars and their drivers. Brian Tee is her Japanese boyfriend D.K. who has ties to organized crime and whose initials stand for Drift King. Hes also a master of the menacing smile. ""Nacho Libre"" ""Nacho Libre"" finds Jack Black in or overflowing from polyester stretch pants and a preposterous cape. Hes very funny at first jumping around like some Zorro with a bad body mass index but his antics wear thin all too soon. Mr. Black plays Nacho a Mexican nebbish who grew up in a monastery and works incompetently as its cook serving tasteless slops to woebegone orphans. Nothing much happens though the nothingness is fairly amusing until Nacho goes off to moonlight as a Lucha Libre wrestler -- a luchador in the Mexican tradition. Then the same thing happens over and over. He and his mournful partner in the ring The Skeleton (Hector Jimenez) earn tidy sums for being beaten within centimeters of their lives and Nacho uses his losings to provide the orphans with decent food. ENLARGE Jack Black in Nacho Libre This broad and noisy comedy was directed by Jared Hess from a script that he wrote with his wife Jerusha Hess and Mike White. Mr. Hess is the man who made ""Napoleon Dynamite"" an extraordinary debut film done in a deadpan style that won the hearts and yes minds of young audiences who made it a hit. But theres a difference between deadpan and dead. ""Nacho Libres"" early scenes are as good as they are because Jack Black underplays them. Yes he does so with an absurd Mexican accent and with a lecher-in-the-headlights expression whenever hes in the presence of Sister Encarnacion a beautiful nun played by Ana de la Reguera. Still this constitutes understatement for such an outsize comic talent. Once Nacho gets the wrestling bug though its all about Jack Black the irrepressible clown and the comedy dies a slow death for lack of fresh ideas. The film was made incidentally in Oaxaca a location that ends up looking incidental. Apart from a few mountain exteriors and a throwaway visit to the ruins of Monte Alban the whole thing could have been shot in Los Angeles.    DVD TIP In the time-warping thriller ""Frequency"" (2000) a lonely son talks to his father across 30 years not merely two with a ham-radio rig that once belonged to the old man. Dennis Quaid plays the father Frank a New York City firefighter in the 1960s. James Caviezel is Franks son a New York City cop. Gregory Hoblit directed with feeling from Toby Emmerichs original script.

Kate (Sandra Bullock) and Alex (Keanu Reeves) live in different years. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Lake House"" with Keanu Reeves Sandra Bullock Christopher Plummer Dylan Walsh Shohreh Aghdashloo. Directed by Alejandro Agresti from a screenplay by David Auburn based on the motion picture ""Il Mare."" 108 minutes. Rated PG for some language and a disturbing image. Several theaters. Alejandro Agrestis romantic drama ""The Lake House"" is a pretty soap bubble of a movie. Its lovely to look at and calming to watch but dont try to touch it -- it just might pop and vanish right there in your hand. Based on the 2000 South Korean film ""Il Mare"" (which to my knowledge has never been released in theaters here) its the story of a pretty lonely Chicago doctor named Kate (Sandra Bullock) and a handsome lonely architect named Alex (Keanu Reeves). As the film begins we see Kate and her dog Jack moving out of the house shes been renting by the lake. Its a strange glass-walled place on stilts crouching delicately above the water like a pretty spaceship. She leaves a note for the next tenant who turns out to be Alex and they begin a correspondence. Only one problem Theyre living in different years. Unlike most other time-travel dramas like ""Somewhere in Time"" or ""Frequency"" Kate and Alex actually arent too far apart Shes in 2006 hes in 2004. And the ease with which they accept their unusual circumstances is remarkable. Before you know it theyre taking strolls around the city together separated only by the minor inconvenience of living in different time periods. (How do they do this? Well ... they just do.) Because the couple is taking all of this so calmly we take it all in too. It takes Shohreh Aghdashloo in the small but bracing role of a brisk fellow doctor who befriends Kate to act as the voice of reason. Hearing about her friends epistolary affair shes horrified. ""Hes in prison isnt he?"" she demands abruptly. Well no ... everything about David Auburns sweet sincere screenplay is meant to be taken at face value; you either buy into it or you dont. The lake house entirely transparent with its curtainless glass (what dont they have a bathroom?) sits serenely in the middle of the movie as its central metaphor It doesnt make sense but there it is. If you start fretting about the details of this movie not only will your forehead get all wrinkled (So if he waits two years hell catch up? But wont she have moved on? And what about that dog?) but youll lose its delicate pleasure. Bullock an underrated dramatic actress gives a gentle performance here that well suits the movies mood; she never overplays emotions. Reeves never the most expressive of actors is less effective mostly because he gets bogged down in the screenplays architect-speak (he has to talk a great deal about interconnection and light). But theres something romantically appealing about these two lonely souls colliding against all odds. You root for them even as you know that its all pretty silly -- and even as a too-obvious early foreshadowing has told us more than we want to know. In the height of the summer movie season when the multiplexes are full of noise you might find the quiet of ""The Lake House"" appealing. Just be careful as with all glass houses not to throw stones.

Starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Directed by Alejandro Agresti. (PG. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) People in movie romances dont behave like the rest of us. If they did maybe they wouldnt be worth a movie romance. Maybe theyd be too much of this world. Take the cozy love story ""The Lake House."" Keanu Reeves finds out through notes in his mailbox that he is communicating with Sandra Bullock who is living in 2006 while he is living at the same lake house in 2004. How does he react? With wonder at this supernatural occurrence? Does he ask how John Kerry made out? Does he want to know who won the fifth race at Pimlico? Does he ask for a stock tip? Or does he get altruistic and try to find out about say aviation disasters so as to contact the future passengers and tell them to take the train? No he greets this only as an opportunity to establish a correspondence with a nice woman. He thinks maybe hes found a girlfriend. Likewise Bullock. She plays a woman communicating with a man from two years earlier. Does she tell him to contact the Army Corps of Engineers about the levee situation in New Orleans? Does she instruct him to inform Kerry about the Swift Boat guys? Does she even do something fun like Google her new pen pal and tell him everything hell do over the next two years? No she just floats around in a wistful cloud hoping someday to meet him. This is not normal behavior and in anything other than a movie this would not be admirable. Emotionally balanced adults would not be so egocentric or so fixated on romance to the exclusion of everything else. Yet we accept this behavior from ostensibly normal adults in a movie romance because the people stand for us. Theyre fantasy glorifications of the selfishness of new love. They give us two hours of license to care about nothing but the characters emotional lives and by extension our own. The measure of this kind of movie is its seductiveness not its logic nor the ways in which it exploits the supernatural angle and ""The Lake House"" is seductive. Bullock and Reeves are good together and theyre just as good not together communicating across a gulf of time through letters. In fact this is one of the few relationship movies of recent vintage in which the principal characters come to know each other in a relaxed way. They dont have to meet cute. They dont have to get into a big argument 20 minutes before the finish. Instead the relationship stays in that good phase -- its all courtship and longing -- and the drama comes not from fake conflict but from the challenge of this two-year distance. ""The Lake House"" depends on the charm and quirky intelligence of its lead actors. (Remember when Reeves used to seem stupid? Thats a distant memory now.) It also more than most romances depends on the ability of the actors to project thoughtfulness and emotion in moments of isolation. Both are good at this. Bullock is so good at it that its become a staple of her movies the scene in which she returns home to a silent house and contemplates her life. David Auburn the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright wrote the original screenplay which moves between two distinct time periods seamlessly without ever becoming confusing. (Bullock has a different haircut for each year which helps. I vote for the 2004 model.) If Auburn is responsible for the arresting concept director Alejandro Agresti is responsible for creating the atmosphere that sustains it. Its a delicate hyper-romantic atmosphere pensive and steeped in longing that covers over the storys inconsistencies -- or at least offers enough distraction to make us not care. -- Advisory A violent car accident adult situations.

Not in iambs anyway. And not at the same time. Their problem is one of temporal misalignment. He exists in 2004 she in 2006. Theyve taken turns residing in the same glass lake house where they hunger for true love and exchange pensive letters in a mailbox of never-explained magical powers. In 2006 she writes him a note pops it in the box flips up the tin red flag. Pfft it instantly arrives in 2004. He flips the flag down reads the note and inserts a reply flag up. Pfft 2006. In this fashion the pen pals fall in love writing of their dreams their parents their scruffy dog (one and the same). Pfft shes homesick for trees at the lake house. Pfft he plants a sapling outside her soon-to-be Chicago apartment which matures two years later (rather quickly) into a shade-giving oasis. With all this pffting around youd think Alex might ask a few shrewd questions about politics or stocks but The Lake House isnt concerned with such things. Its one concern is amour. Clutch breast. Flush pink. Sigh. As a pair Kate and Alex are oh-so everything oh-so lonely oh-so beautiful. Theyre also oh-so separated by the space-time continuum which means Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock dont share too many lusty clutches; witness the discreet PG rating a rare thing for a love story in the age of booty calls. Alex does manage to track her down in ""his"" time when shes tied to a dutiful beau (Dylan Walsh) but mostly their liaison relies on split-screen wizardry and fluent editing (by Alejandro Brodersohn and Lynzee Klingman). Based on the Korean film Il Mare and gauzily realized by Argentine director Alejandro Agresti (Valentin) The Lake House is unreconstituted mystical bunkum. As bunkum goes its not all bad but it lacks cohesion -- and it relies too often and too lazily on cliches. There are better entries in the chronicles of thwarted love Somewhere in Time for era-hopping romance 88 Charing Cross Road for remote epistolary yearning. The Lake House twice excerpts the famous ambulatory-kiss scene from Notorious a classic bit of nibbling eroticism that Agresti might have been wise to avoid. Wedging Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman into the film wasnt exactly fair to its stars. Still it does have a few things going for it. One is Alar Kivilos airy photography which shows a warm regard for Chicagos broad urban musculature. Another is its reflective cud-chewing on love and the conundrum of timing -- whom we can love when we can love them. (Its a riddle tackled by Jane Austens Persuasion much referenced here.) And I suppose its nice after all this time to see Speed co-stars Reeves and Bullock together again though Im not sure why the mysterious mailbox mojo chose to reunite them here. Both do their pining-lover best to act depressed. The film moves toward a spooky coincidence that canny viewers will predict in the first act. I wish I hadnt; it killed all the films suspense and much of its dewy seduction. ""Can this be happening?"" asks Alex in an early correspondence but he got his tenses wrong. It has happened. It will happen. Even without the gift of foresight the future is in plain view. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Onitsuka Tiger Unisex Ultimate 81 Shoes for 28 + free shipping KeySmart 2.0 Compact Key Organizer for 10 + free shipping Tommy Hilfiger via eBay Clearance Sale Extra 50% off + free...

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post If ""The Lake House"" was a real property this sign might hang on its fence ""Beware of dogs that star Keanu Reeves and involve space-time physics."" Because chances are the story line will twist in ways that invite disbelief and not of the suspended variety. Puzzling through the ""Matrix"" labyrinths was part of the fun of that franchise. Even then the quandaries became too much for the saga to bear. Directed by Argentine Alejandro Agresti in his first English-language film ""The Lake House"" swamps its heart-aimed ambitions with too many head- scratching moments. Reteaming Reeves and Sandra Bullock for the first time since ""Speed"" the romantic fable begins when two people living exactly two years apart start communicating by letter. (What a leap year would do to this scenario we dont know.) Over time - but separated by it - they fall for each other. Its a premise you either go with or dont. The rub is even when you do midway through youll begin to notice it isnt quite working. Its 2006 at least in Dr. Kate Foresters world. Shes headed to a job in Chicago and closing her pristine glass-and-steel house perched on a quiet lake outside the city. Before driving away in her vintage Mustang she leaves a note for the next tenant. Please forward my mail. And forgive the paw prints on the walkway. When Alex Wyler (Reeves) arrives in an equally vintage Chevy pickup the place is in sorry shape. An architect by calling and a subdivision developer out of filial rebellion he sets to restoring it. His father played with a gruff chill by Christopher Plummer designed and built the place when Alex was a boy. Alex reads Kates note. What paw prints? he wonders and writes back. He dates the letter 2004. It doesnt take long for Kate and Alex to accept that by writing each other they are rewriting the laws of physics. ""I think we have the same dog"" he observes at one point. Jack a sprite of a terrier mix is a bolt of light for each. What director Agresti doesnt help his personable leads do is achieve much chemistry. And its not because for much of the film theyre kept apart. Youre never quite sure which Keanu Reeves youll get in a movie. This version is flat yet strains. Bullock brings some of the new assurance she continues to hone doing indie films like ""Crash"" and Kevin Bacons ""Loverboy"" in limited release this summer. Kate and Alex have mail. So much in fact that at some point we wonder how many miles the good doctor drives to drop her missives in the mailbox by the rural house. No stranger to dramatizing complicated material Tony winner David Auburn (""Proof"") furnishes this tale based on a 2000 South Korean flick with notions about home control connection and yes timing. Once confided in neither Kates mother nor Alexs younger brother Henry treat the nearly beloveds like lunatics. That might have nudged the movie toward comedy. ""The Lake House"" could use some levity. Thank goodness for Shohreh Aghdashloo who plays the attending doctor at Kates hospital. Kate and Annas scene at a bar floats on Aghdashloos husky laugh and wry wisdom. At a preview screening filmgoers chuckled as the dog watches the mailbox arm rise and fall seemingly of its own accord. Then they hunkered down in their seats with the realization this was going to be a somber affair. The closer Kate and Alex come to meeting in the same time zone the more convoluted the movie becomes. One things for sure Kates provisional boyfriend Morgan (Dylan Walsh) gets it coming and going. Film critic Lisa Kennedy can be reached at 303-820-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

Comments The Lake House Recommended Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are both such guarded celebrities that I have a hard time imagining them as lovers a problem this romantic fantasy set in Chicago surmounted by isolating them from each other almost entirely. The engaging script adapted by David Auburn (Proof) from the South Korean movie Siworae (2000) separates the leads not by distance but by time living in a picturesque lake house in suburban Willow Springs Reeves keeps getting notes in his mailbox from Bullock and eventually realizes that shes living in the same house two years in the future. Teasing out the practical implications of this premise takes up most of the movie which helps contain a trite subplot about Reevess relationship with his famous father (Christopher Plummer) and allows the two stars to luxuriate in their solitude.

"Sweet Lake House happily leaves no room for logic - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Sweet Lake House happily leaves no room for logic By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  June 16 2006 How deeply silly is ``The Lake House""? As silly as a movie about two letter-writing lovers separated by a wrinkle in time can be. How much sweet dumb fun is it? More than you might want to admit.Based on a 2000 Korean film called ``Il Mare"" ``Lake House"" falls squarely in the genre of overripe early-90s chick flicks such as ``Ghost"" (1990) ``Only You"" (1994) and ``Untamed Heart"" (1993) the last forever enshrined as ``the Christian Slater monkey heart movie."" Such films believe love can break through time and the great beyond and theyre willing to employ gauzy lenses retro pop songs and dazed-looking Hollywood stars to seduce moviegoers into their tender traps.You can enjoy a movie like this straight up and have a good happy cry or you can enjoy it as an outrageous camp hoot. Either way the most appropriate setting probably isnt a movie theater but your own couch late at night -- blanket and Ben amp; Jerrys optional. Its called romantic melodrama children and its nothing to be ashamed of.Heres where I tell you about the plot and be advised that it makes as much sense as eggs at a barbecue. Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) moves out of her lakefront house -- a glass-and-steel contraption that looks like one of Frank Lloyd Wrights minor burps -- and leaves a note in the mailbox telling the new renter where to forward her mail. Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) a hunky disaffected architect moves in and leaves a tart note in response.Wouldnt he want to send it to her apartment? Of course he wouldnt; on some level he already knows this is a magic mailbox. Kate drives out one day from her job patching up ER cases with head nurse Shohreh Aghdashloo  reads the note and leaves another. And so their epistolary pas de deux begins. Its not as lyrical as the one Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan had going in ``The Shop Around the Corner"" but Reeves and Bullock are such engaging lunkheads that you go with it.Theres a catch of course. Shes living in 2006. Hes living in 2004. That means Alex is renting the lake house before Kate. This is a harder nut to crack than a bi-coastal relationship Its bi-temporal.Within this set up director Alejandro Agresti and scripter David Auburn -- he wrote the higher-math sudser ``Proof"" and is clearly employing arcane romantic algorithms here -- ring all sorts of guilty-pleasure twists. For instance Alex sends Kate on a walking tour of Chicago that ends with a wall on which he spray-painted a message two years earlier.In the films most shamelessly sappy scene he shows up at a 2004 bash thrown by her then-boyfriend (Dylan Walsh) and woos her with words and a backyard slow dance to Paul McCartneys ``This Never Happened Before."" (Good title since the song didnt come out until late 2005.) Suddenly Kates new memory comes flooding in Hes the guy she kissed at that party two years earlier.By this point the part of your brain that likes kittens has thrown in the towel. The part of your brain that pays the bills is saying ``Now wait just a minute."" Why couldnt Kate send Alex her 2004 e-mail address or phone number and tell him to just bluff it out? Why couldnt he tell her where he lives in 2006? Watching them stare at that mailbox until the tin flag flies up of its own accord wears thin after a while; listening to them ``talk"" their letters to the air is absurd from the get-go.There are complications and theres much busy acting from the supporting players especially Christopher Plummer as Alexs dad a famous architect with an ego bigger than any of his buildings. (Plummer has a wonderful speech toward the end about how architecture captures the light; it feels cut-and-pasted from one of Auburns serious plays.)Reeves and Bullock are perfectly matched though they seem to belong to the same species -- theyre the black labs of movie stars. Together for the first time since ``Speed"" the two fire off mild wisecracks in one scene and look terribly wistful in the next and thats all thats required. Even though theyre hardly on screen together theres more chemistry here than in all of ``The Break-Up.""Anyway Agresti and Auburn know who their audience is and its not alpha males. As soon as Kate lets drop that her favorite author is Jane Austen and the Nick Drake songs kick in on the soundtrack you know this movie wont be taking any prisoners. Dont fight it with logic because youll lose. ``The Lake House"" understands we all have moments of bad timing in our lives but nothing like this. This is gloriously ridiculous.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Rating PG for some language and a disturbing image Running time 1 hour 48 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Illogical Lake House sinks into absurdity Posted 6/15/2006 937 PM ET E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Rumor has it that John Cusack was offered the Keanu Reeves part in The Lake House and turned it down. Wise man that Cusack. The Lake House is one of the more befuddling movies of recent years. The premise makes no sense no matter how you turn it around in your head. It attempts to be a romance a time-traveling mystery and a meditation on loneliness. It doesnt succeed at any of the three. The movie re-teams Speeds Reeves and Sandra Bullock and they do have chemistry in the rare moments they are together. Bullock plays a doctor with no time for a love life (a prototype we see often on TV shows as well as in last years Just Like Heaven). Reeves plays a gifted architect. The two fall in love but nothing is ever easy. It turns out Reeves is living in 2004 while Bullocks existence is set squarely in 2006. Dont you hate when that happens? And more important how can this happen? The truly strange thing about the movie a remake of a Korean film is that no one really questions the logic of this occurrence. The two meet because they have both lived in the same glass-enclosed house overlooking a lake. They correspond through handwritten missives which they leave in a magic mailbox that signals when theyve got mail by mysteriously raising its flag. It makes no sense why these two well-educated professionals their friends and family would simply accept that they have managed to defy time and logic. This melodramatic romance moves at a glacial pace. It also takes itself too seriously. Films such as Somewhere in Time have pulled off the time-traveling love story with more aplomb. Even if we suspend disbelief completely The Lake House is unconvincing unsatisfying and unmoving. Posted 6/15/2006 937 PM ET E-mail | Print | Enlarge Warner Bros.

Talk about a bad date. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 16 2006 Save for later Saved Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) is a woman who believes in keeping her distance in a relationship. In ""The Lake House"" a wan weepie she gets her wish - and then some. She enters into a romance with a man who is literally living two years in the past.Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) first realizes something is amiss when he moves back into the badly neglected lakefront residence in suburban Illinois where he grew up as a child. A note in the mailbox from Kate its previous tenant asks him to forward her mail. He writes back that she must be mistaken because the place has had no previous tenant. In the ensuing back and forth it becomes clear that Alex is living unhappily in 2004 while Kate is moodily ensconced in 2006.The quasi-time-travel gimmick here is derived from a South Korean film called ""Il Mare."" Were meant to pine for these two to somehow get together instead of living years apart. I was tempted to wisecrack ""But they already got together - in Speed"" The physics or metaphysics of their attempts to unite are nonsensical and often confusing without meaning to be. Questions arise such as ""Why dont they just try e-mailing each other?"" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In ""The Lake House"" love means having to wait. And wait. Alex is a frustrated architect - his estranged father (Christopher Plummer) built that waterfront residence in happier times - and Kate is a mopey physician. Both are single although Kate was engaged to a lawyer (Dylan Walsh) whose only drawback seems to be that he is living in the same year she is. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Because their lives are otherwise without romance the stage is set for Alex and Kate to woo each other. They may not be in sync chronologically but temperamentally they are two of a kind.Reeves is engaging enough and Bullock is not as annoying as she used to be. As she ages her girl-next-door shtick seems to be winding down. (Her scabrous performance was one of the few things I liked in ""Crash."") But great love stories require great spirit and the script by David Auburn who wrote the overrated play ""Proof"" is lackluster. The most impassioned moment in fact comes not from the ""lovers"" but from a rhapsodic monologue by Alexs father describing how architectural design can capture the light.There is a germ of a good idea in the notion that an imaginary suitor can be more powerful than a real one. But director Alejandro Agresti isnt the man to pull it off. If youre a masochist this film will work well on a double bill with ""The Break-Up."" In that movie we couldnt wait for the couple to split up. Here we wait an eternity for them to connect. Grade C Rated PG for some language and a disturbing image.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr C- The Lake House Genre Drama Mystery and Thriller; Starring Sandra Bullock Keanu Reeves; Director Alejandro Agresti; Author David Auburn; Release Date Wide 06/16/2006; Runtime (in minutes) 105; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted June 14 2006 -- 1200 AM EDT In the chemistry-challenged specimen of serendipity and romantic fate-tampering called The Lake House Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) a melancholy but pretty Chicago doctor living in 2006 meets her soul mate Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) a melancholy but pretty architect whose only drawback as boyfriend material is that hes living in 2004. And not just in his mind but in reality The man really exists in a world two years less spam-filled than Kates. No problemo. Somehow via wrinkles in the time-space continuum and fairy dust in the sugar bowl Kate and Alex are able to communicate with one another from the past to the present. Or is it the present to the past? Either way the two bond over their love of the title piece of real estate a melancholy but pretty glass structure as light-filled camera-ready and difficult to get to (its built on piles thrusting up from the water) as a movie stars trophy weekend home designed by a celebrity architect. Kate who used to rent the place before she moved back to Chicago (to be lonely work in a hospital and absorb woman-to-woman advice from Shohreh Aghdashloo as her ER colleague) leaves a note for ""the next tenant."" And the next tenant -- actually of course he used to live there in the past when the structure was neglected -- turns out to be Alex whose crotchety celebrity architect of a father (Christopher Plummer) built the joint in the first place. (Its so not worth being confused here.) The only real magic in The Lake House is that Kate and Alex have never heard of e-mail They write to one another in beautifully penned handwriting on creamy stationery folded into crisp envelopes and stashed in a magic mailbox with an old-fashioned youve-got-mail flag right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. Freaky Maybe Alex and Kate actually simultaneously live in 1954 and 1956 and 2004 and 2006 I never saw Il Mare the 2000 South Korean film picked up by producers Doug Davison and Roy Lee for export dismantling and American retrofitting. (The duo transformed the Asian thrillers Ju-On and Ringu into the American hits The Grudge and The Ring.) So I cant report what East-to-West challenges -- not to mention Bullock-and-Reeves headliner requirements -- bested Proof playwright David Auburn as he wrestled the original into a shape suitable for an American audience. But weve all seen Bullock and Reeves (apart and once together) and its clear that Argentinean director Alejandro Agresti best known in the U.S. for his sugary coming-of-age drama Valentin has put too much faith in audience fondness for that cute duo who starred in Speed a dozen years ago. Now the stars are doing Slow -- shes winsome on cue hes pained. Its as if The Lake House team decided that the easiest way to deal with the pesky time-warp thing would be to ram the notion through counting on viewers sticking around for star smooching. Call me an unromantic logician but I think the expectation is a leap too far.

"Lake House The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lake-house-the ) Lake House The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Although this may amount to oversimplification Alejandro Agrestis The Lake House is essentially a romance between two people connected by a time-traveling mailbox. As premises go this has the virtue of uniqueness - Hollywood doesnt churn out time-traveling mailbox movies on a regular basis. Unfortunately trying doesnt necessarily mean succeeding and even for those who buy into the basic ideas there are credibility gaps that The Lake House cannot surmount. And for those who attempt to apply logic to this movie everything will come crashing down like a poorly balanced house of cards. The Lake House is based on the 2000 South Korean film Il Mare which I have not seen. The final scene however is lifted not from the original but from the Hollywood shelf of cheap cop-outs. How many foreign films when ""translated"" into English find their endings mangled or made over in order to pander to ""mainstream"" sensibilities? (Ironically the ending of Il Mare was criticized in some circles for being too upbeat although apparently not upbeat enough for Warner Brothers which remove all vestiges of ambiguity.) The Lake House is about the unlikely love affair between two lonely people Alex (Keanu Reeves) and Kate (Sandra Bullock). Both live in an extravagant glass walled house on the shore of Lake Michigan - he in 2004 and she in 2006. They ""meet"" and begin exchanging correspondence via the houses mailbox. The fact that their letters are traveling through time doesnt seem to bother them. Eventually seeking to meet his soulmate Alex seeks out Kates 2004 counterpart. For her part Kate waits patiently for Alex to ""catch up"" to her. In for a penny in for a pound they say. If you choose to see The Lake House you have to accept it as a fairy tale time travel paradoxes and all. Dont think too hard - youll spoil the mood. The romance which is delicately developed as these two people reach out across the years to each other is effective but theres almost too much baggage. Two things in particular bothered me about this film and neither had to do with its preposterous premise. First despite all their correspondence these two never send pictures. As a veteran of a long distance relationship I can attest that pictures are the lifeblood of such interaction. Secondly Kate never does an Internet search for her would-be love. Such lapses by the screenplay are unforgivable. The Lake House represents the reunion of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock who were last seen discussing the potential future of a relationship that starts under tense circumstances. The spark that ignited between them in Speed still burns - they make an appealing couple. Of course since The Lake House is rated PG their chemistry is more ""cute"" than ""sexy."" Christopher Plummer and Shoreh Aghdashloo have supporting roles (he as Alexs famous architect father; she as Kates boss at a Chicago hospital). Really though their roles are peripheral. The Lake House lives and dies based on Reeves and Bullock. By keeping the human element of the film more important than the fantastical one they ground The Lake House and allow us to overlook many of its contrivances. I am conflicted about this film. I like the fact that it takes chances. I appreciate that its trying to do a supernatural love story without falling into the schmaltz of Ghost. Yet I recognize that the screenplay is like Swiss cheese - riddled with holes some of which are bigger and more distracting than others. The Lake House also has the odd distinction of raising metaphysical questions without boasting an overly intelligent storyline. Despite the conventional ending which has a tacky tacked-on feel the movie is designed for those who are more adventurous when it comes to romance. It will be interesting to see if it finds an audience.

A peculiar wrinkle in time links two Chicago lonely hearts in ""The Lake House"" but director Alejandro Agresti and screenwriter David Auburn seem more interested in making a wanly romantic Hallmark postcard than a movie resonating with mystery and loss. Based on Lee Hyeon-seungs 2000 Korean romancer ""Il Mare"" pic reps one of the first Hollywood remakes of a recent East Asian film not belonging to the horror genre. But pic lacks the astonishing moments strong emotions or real amusement -- let alone real heat between co-leads Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock -- that would encourage more remakes of its kind or generate any feeling in audiences other than indifference. A mailbox at a home built on stilts over a body of water becomes a conduit for a pair of the homes occupants separated by a two-year time span in the original cute but finally messy ""Il Mare"" story. This time it feels strained. The sheer fun of being in the position of Dr. Kate Forster (Bullock) or architect Alex Wyler (Reeves) and communicating with a stranger across time is filtered out of Argentine helmer Agrestis (""Valentin"" ""The Act in Question"") handling with pic aiming for profundity through multiple story levels that arent fully realized. Opening minutes almost exactly trace ""Il Mare"" with Kate packing and moving from the glass-box-style house perched over Lake Michigan on Chicagos North Shore and Alex moving in finding a note from Kate in the mailbox requesting her mail be forwarded and apologizing for the dog paw prints at the entrance. Alex doesnt see any paw prints but a day or so later a dog appears and makes a mess. As the pair starts exchanging puzzled notes Kate corrects Alex on his dating noting that its 2006 not 2004. Agresti has the mailboxs red flag go magically up and down to show Alex and Kate are connecting -- a clever visual device. Nonetheless one wonders why when the twosome are clearly growing interested in one another Kate doesnt simply give Alex her phone number. The adaptation by Auburn (""Proof"") departs from the original in the half-achieved dramatization of Kates (other) love life and Alexs family life particularly in the complicated interaction between Alex his father Simon (Christopher Plummer) and Alexs younger brother Henry (Ebon Moss-Bachrach). Even as Kates involvement with buttoned-down lawyer Morgan (Dylan Walsh) leads to potential frissons of emotions that never ignite the playing out of Alexs love-hate relationship with Simon uneasily tries to draw connections between the main love story and a father-son drama that poses the same sort of tensions between a genius parent and unsure mentor-child as in ""Proof"" but with far less conviction. ""The Lake House"" is never quite sure what it wants to be -a magical-mysterious love story a psychodrama a sprawling family saga or an uneasy combination of these. For all its manifest nonsense ""Il Mare"" maintained direction as a chamber piece between two characters trying to connect across time if not space; ""The Lake House"" aspires to be more and in the process loses track of its central core. Bullock makes the rather glum n solemn Kate a shade glummer bringing the movies energy level down several stops. Reeves on the other hand seems pleased when his Alex senses that true love is entering his life. In a fatuously written role Plummer loads on the ham to distressing effect while Shohreh Aghdashloo (as Kates doctor friend) and Walsh are burdened with poorly conceived dialogue. Moss-Bachrach contributes a nice accent of friskiness. Production package is solid though uninspired including a Rachel Portman score that hints that the talented composer is repeating herself once too often and a misty-eyed lensing scheme by Alar Kivilo. Key contribution by production designer Nathan Crowley a house you might not want to really live in is far from memorable.
