"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"First Dates Good Flick Bad Shtick washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On First Dates Good Flick Bad Shtick Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 13 2004 Until a few years ago it was easy to pigeonhole Adam Sandlers performances into one of two categories obnoxious and slightly less obnoxious. But then he met the director Paul Thomas Anderson and starred in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" a wry slightly bent romantic comedy in which Sandler exhibited heretofore unexpressed subtlety and range. Wisps of that persona occasionally float through ""50 First Dates"" a slapstick romance in which he plays a marine-life veterinarian living in Hawaii who falls in love with a woman suffering from a brain injury that has destroyed her short-term memory. Make no mistake ""50 First Dates"" is an Adam Sandler movie with all the broad physical comedy crude humor and lack of technical finesse the genre implies. But even mired within Sandlers tastelessness and self-regard a certain sweetness manages to seep through like a vein of sweet water weakly bubbling up out of a swamp. The premise of ""50 First Dates"" of course is derived unapologetically from ""Groundhog Day."" Thats no disgrace; one of the cardinal rules of show business is to steal from the best and ""Groundhog Day"" is one of the all-time greats an ingeniously conceived classic that featured an unforgettable performance by Bill Murray as a man doomed to relive the same day over and over again. In ""50 First Dates"" Lucy played by Drew Barrymore lives each day as if it were the Sunday she got into a car accident with her father She wears the same clothes eats the same breakfast at the same place cooks her dad the same birthday dinner. One of the movies most unexpectedly touching sequences shows how Lucys father (played with gruff pathos by Blake Clark) and brother (Sean Astin affecting a Mike Tyson lisp) spend every night preparing for the next day whitewashing walls that Lucy painted plucking a Sunday paper from the stack theyve had printed up washing the same pink T-shirt. When Henry Roth (Sandler) meets Lucy he upsets the routine and after some set pieces involving the couple meeting over and over ""50 First Dates"" concerns itself with how Henry will help Lucy manage her disorder rather than deny it the way her family has helped her to do. Its not a bad idea for a movie and in other hands ""50 First Dates"" could have been something of a modern classic A  la ""Groundhog Day"" as a bittersweet meditation on renewing passion and emotional commitment. But ""50 First Dates"" is in Sandlers hands meaning that it bears the worst of his signature slapstick tropes and a co-starring role for the execrable Rob Schneider here playing a pot-smoking islander with a clouded-over left eye. Barrymore who co-produced the picture with Sandler spends most of the time looking attractively blank until shes forced to act which is never a great idea. Whats more a potentially simple and charming story has been loaded down with lots of cheap audience-pleasing sops from Lucys lovable quirks (she likes to make tepees and log cabins out of her breakfast waffles) to countless cutaway shots of penguins dolphins and other beguiling sea creatures. Still with all the walrus vomit and the wet-fish slaps; with the jokes about sexual identity and smelling peoples fingers; with the stock takes of an elderly man spouting profanities and other characters delivering rude gestures ""50 First Dates"" possesses an undeniable heart. The bad news is that it will still be buried underneath layers of stale Sandlerisms tomorrow and the next day and the next. 50 First Dates (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for crude sexual humor and drug references.

Pic offers nothing to alter the situation. Those who took a shine to his previous romantic outing with Drew Barrymore ""The Wedding Singer"" will turn out to make this a roughly equal-sized hit. Just as the population is split between Republicans and Democrats Coke and Pepsi drinkers and SUV lovers and haters so is it apparently divided over the appeal of Adam Sandler. The comic actors latest ""50 First Dates"" offers nothing to alter the situation; the unconverted will find no reason to change their minds while those who took a shine to his previous romantic outing with Drew Barrymore ""The Wedding Singer"" will turn out to make this a roughly equal-sized hit beginning with a big Valentines Day weekend opening. The premise of first-timer George Wings screenplay in which a brain-damaged young woman wakes up every morning unable to remember what happened to her the day before thereby requiring her ardent suitor to continually win her over afresh seems potentially catchy on paper. But thats different from actually having to watch Sandler invent ever more extreme methods of attracting Barrymores favorable attention ad infinitum while trying to figure out a way to make her remember him. In the end there is something mildly beguiling about the spectacle of a lifelong commitment-phobe single-mindedly extending the limits of his imagination to break down this womans rather unique barrier. But much of this interest stems from the alliance he eventually forges with her father. Initially hostile to the eager fellows annoying persistence the ex-sailor and fisherman is played in a completely disarming turn by Blake Clark whose imposing physicality foghorn voice withering glances and deep-down likability conjure up an unlikely but winning combination of John Wayne and William Demarest. Lets see more of this guy. In fact the entire supporting cast is continually threatening to take over the movie and this is not entirely a good thing. On the one hand Sean Astin wrings a string of laughs out of his resourceful clowning as Barrymores younger brother a short overcompensating muscleman whos addicted to steroids and speaks with a lisp. On the other Sandler cohort Rob Schneider hams it up as a paunchy middle-aged Hawaiian stoner in an eyebrow-raising ethnic caricature that more than once calls to mind Mickey Rooneys unfortunate Japanese turn in ""Breakfast at Tiffanys."" In the middle are Lusia Strus campy pranks as Sandlers sex-starved sea-park assistant of unknown gender affiliation and aquatic creatures that perform cutely on cue but seem dragged in on a ""when in doubt cut to the penguin"" basis. Pic features as many reaction shots of animals as an ""Our Gang"" comedy. Unavoidably however it all comes back around to Sandler whose Sea Life Park vet Henry Roth is presented in the opening reel as Gods gift to scrumptious female tourists who dont want to leave Hawaii without having had a real good time. He breaks his own rule by becoming smitten with a local Lucy Whitmore (Barrymore) whom he chats up in a beachside diner and who falls for him because he smells like fish. The next day however Lucy hasnt the slightest idea who this overly familiar guy is and the reason why is quickly explained The year before she was injured in a car crash that wiped out her short-term memory. Her father and brother coddle her to protect her from the pain of reliving the accident. At first Henry tries a succession of new come-ons at the diner all of which fail. In pics most excruciating section he attempts to catch her eye as she drives by on a remote road. But once he wises up to her condition he goes for less antic solutions finally making a genuine effort to push her through her quandary and ultimately make her fall in love with him every day. Storys concept possesses the worthwhile central kernel that once you win someones love you shouldnt take it for granted but should continue to nurture and merit it. Under the direction of Peter Segal (""Anger Management"") however pics explicit sentiments more often sound like sappy greeting-card lines promoting such ideas as ""Nothing beats a first kiss"" something the lead couple can experience every day. Sandler and Barrymore interact easily together and they make their characters neuroses problems and hang-ups dovetail properly at least on the storys terms. But vast majority of the humor is so grotesquely obvious and crudely presented (in addition to being mildly crude in and of itself) that Sandler dissenters are guaranteed to remain just where they are. 50 First DatesProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures presentation of a Happy Madison/Anonymous Content/Flower Films production.

"50 First Dates Adam Sandler makes nice. Slate Sign In Sign Up 50 First Dates Adam Sandler makes nice. 50 First Dates Adam Sandler makes nice. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 13 2004 747 AM Adam Sandler Makes Nice 50 First Dates is surprisingly um sweet. By David Edelstein For the umpteenth time ... Its hard to believe that the sweetest Valentines Day-type romantic comedy in years should open with a giant walrus projectile-vomiting into the face of a Slavic aquarium worker of comically indeterminate gender. But the first 15 minutes of 50 First Dates (Columbia Pictures) are gross--gross in the lazy reflexive way that passes for comedy in an age in which teenage boys (and teenage boys at heart) hold the key to a movies performance in the marketplace. I like bad-taste humor more than most people my age (way more actually) but the slovenliness of these gags had me reaching for my coat I thought ""No more jokes about walrus penises no more penguins making rude gestures no more Rob Schneider as a half-naked Hawaiian guy with some kind of dead eye. No more Adam Sandler walking through a movie to collect his 20-plus million."" I knew the premise Sandler falls in love with a woman (Drew Barrymore) with no short-term memory so that he has to win her over ""every friggin day."" And the whole thing seemed so horribly exploitive suddenly. Bleah. Advertisement Then something weird happened The movie got really really good. Barrymore had a lot to do with its recovery. In 50 First Dates she plays Lucy Whitmore a warm and quick-witted art teacher who Sandler spies in a cafe making a castle out of her waffles. He plays Henry Roth--not the writer but an arctic marine veterinarian marking time in Hawaii where he likes to seduce single-women tourists and then blow them off with a cockamamie story. Hes not a jerk about it though He wants them to keep their golden memories. The fact that Lucy is a local makes him nervous but theres something about her he cant shake. They make a date for breakfast the next day then catch each other in the parking lot doing identical dances of joy. You know from the previews that when Henry shows up the next day she doesnt have a clue who he is She tries to have him arrested. Thats when he learns that she had a car accident that injured the part of the brain that holds new memories. Shes fine with everything up to the accident on her dads birthday but every morning she wakes up and the previous days slate has been wiped clean. Its her dads birthday again--and again. This is all sad and creepy for a gross-out comedy but the script by George Wing quickly changes gears. We meet Lucys dad (Blake Clark) and brother (Sean Astin) who not only try to protect her from operators like Henry but from all knowledge of her own condition. The sequence that restarts the movie doesnt feature Sandlers Henry Its the father and brother repeating the day theyve repeated a hundred times before the same birthday cake and video (The Sixth Sense which they have to be surprised by all over again) the same routine of letting Lucy paint big colorful flowers on the wall of her dads workshop. Then they say good night and while she sleeps carry in buckets of white latex and cover her days work over. Its a miraculous episode funny and heartbreaking in equal measure. Advertisement My hunch is that Wings original script didnt have a lot of walrus-barf jokes but Sandler knows his base He remembers that the fans who flocked to garbage like Mr. Deeds and AngerManagement were outraged by that lyrical absurdist romance Punch Drunk Love. So theres lots of slapstick in the margins of every scene--lots of cuts to Lusia Strus made to look even more androgynous than Julia Sweeneys Pat and lots of gags that revolve around Astin flexing his glutes in a hopeless quest to become a bodybuilder. But through it all 50 First Dates stays bravely true to its unresolvable premise. Henry keeps coming back with no triumph lasting more than a few short hours. Will Lucys love for him eventually take root? When she learns of her condition (not for the first time) she gives him advice on how to win her the next day Bring lilies. She says she cant believe she regularly falls for a guy with an egg-shaped head. That egg-shaped head is a little bigger these days Theres something regally entitled about Sandlers manner. The good part of this is that hes rarely in your face (he doesnt need to make every joke kill) and the warmth of his lazy delivery sneaks up on you. Over the years he has developed his own agreeable stock company. Steve Buscemi isnt in this one but the croaky bit player Blake Clark gives a breakthrough performance as Lucys dad; Sean Astin makes the leap from the Shire with a fuddled and funny turn; and Dan Aykroyd has a touching scene as a brain doctor who taps Lucys head and quips that her all-important sense-of-humor region is unimpaired. The camera lingers on all the bit players giving them each a moment to shine. Even Rob Schneider is-- No maybe not. Never mind. 50 First Dates belongs to Barrymore. Id soured on her after last summers nightmarish Charlies Angels Full Throttle (a real career-killer) but in a couple of seconds my memory of that debacle had been wiped clean. Its strange to think of her as coming from such a royal theatrical family Part of her charm is a kind of inspired amateurishness. She has a melting sweetness that makes everything she does--even when in this film she has done it over and over--seem believably new. As in The Wedding Singer she brings out the tenderness in Sandlers aggressive comedy stylings. And she brings out the tenderness in the audience that goes for those aggressive comedy stylings too. Theres a larger Valentines Day theme buried in 50 First Dates. Again and again Lucy is wooed and won; and again and again she says ""Theres nothing like a first kiss."" (The movies first and better title was 50 First Kisses.) Wing and director Peter Segal and Sandler and Barrymore have built a comedy around the thrill of first attraction the sadness that comes from knowing it cant last and the challenge of finding something in the heart to hang onto.

(AP Photo/ Darren Michaels) Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler star in Columbia Pictures romantic comedy ""50 First Dates."" (AP Photo/ Darren Michaels) Photo DARREN MICHAELS One forgettable date / Barrymore the bright spot in Sandler comedy 1 / 1 Back to Gallery 50 First Dates Romantic comedy. Starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. Directed by Peter Segal. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""50 First Dates"" is a mildly pleasing romantic comedy a trifle held together by Drew Barrymores charm and a decent high-concept gimmick A man falls in love with a woman who has short-term memory loss which means that every morning she wakes up not knowing him. Say that premise to anyone and the next question is likely to be ""What happens?"" Thats the best that can be said for ""50 First Dates"" -- it keeps an audience interested in the what- happens question all the way to the finish. But theres a problem a substantial one in a supposed comedy. Its not remotely funny. Adam Sandler isnt funny as the romantic lead and Rob Schneider as a drug-taking Hawaiian is even less funny. Its a peculiar thing to watch. The jokes in ""50 First Dates"" arent jokes and the bits arent bits so much as scattershot gestures in the general direction of comedy at which an audience is expected to laugh not at the joke but at the comics attempt at humor. Or to be more precise at the comics parody of a person attempting humor. Obviously this is either postmodern and lousy or just lousy. When we meet Sandler -- as Henry a marine veterinarian and all-around ladies man in Hawaii -- he is standing on a dock trying to get rid of a beautiful woman with whom hes had a one-week affair. He tells her hes a secret agent and starts talking into his watch. Forget the fact that Sandler who can no longer tuck in his shirt looks like a guy whod be lucky enough to have a once-a-year date on New Years Eve. The bit flops because 1) its witless; 2) Sandler cant make it funny; 3) theres no truth in it (shed never buy it); and 4) it establishes Henry the guy were supposed to like as an infantile moron. Alas in a Sandler movie ""infantile moron"" is just another way of saying ""great guy."" Certainly Lucy (Barrymore) likes him as soon as she meets him when he strikes up a conversation with her over breakfast in a restaurant. Each is excited about the other and they arrange to meet for breakfast the following morning. But the next day she has no idea who he is. Think ""Memento"" without the dead bodies. Everything fun about ""50 First Dates"" derives from the memory-loss concept. Every day she rises believing its Sunday Oct. 13 of the previous year and her father (Blake Clark) and brother (Sean Astin) do everything to maintain that illusion. They give her the same newspaper every morning and every evening they watch a year-old football game on tape. But how long can they keep this up? They know that at a certain point 10 years will have passed and shell freak out at having aged a decade overnight. The gimmicky concept is given an emotional lift by Barrymore who makes a virtue of Lucys brain damage playing her in a constant state of sunniness and sweet discovery. The relationship cant get old because every dates the first -- though why Lucy doesnt start screaming when she sees her boyfriend is anyones guess. Even accounting for the brain trauma hes the one getting the bargain. ""50 First Dates"" contains just enough crude humor to remind everyone that this is a Sandler movie including a love serenade in which he rhymes ""Lucy"" with a slang for her genitals.

"Its fun going on Dates with Sandler Barrymore - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Its fun going on Dates with Sandler Barrymore By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  February 13 2004 You may adore Adam Sandler or you may think hes Jerry Lewiss idiot kid brother but you have to admit hes a canny man. The comedian knows enough to diversify alternating projects that appeal to his core audience of smartass young guys (""Anger Management"" ""Eight Crazy Nights"") date-night couples (""Big Daddy"" ""The Wedding Singer"") and even art-house snobs (the underrated ""Punch-Drunk Love"").""50 First Dates"" is one for the couples especially since it reunites Sandler with his ""Wedding Singer"" costar Drew Barrymore. Maybe its going a little too far to call them the Tracy and Hepburn of their generation but the two cast a disarmingly gentle glow. Neither Sandler nor Barrymore is a conventional Hollywood god Instead they shuffle happily around each other joshing as if the cameras werent rolling and you find yourself enchanted. They play well together -- he gets her to focus and she softens his frat-boy smugness.Then Rob Schneider shows up as a grotesque Hawaiian stoner or the walrus pukes all over the set and were back in Sandler Land. ""50 First Dates"" wants to have it both ways but only one of them really works.The plot -- its inspired and ridiculous at the same time -- is best described as ""Groundhog Day"" meets ""Memento."" Sandler plays Henry Roth a Hawaii-based veterinarian at a Sea World-style aquarium. (This gives director Peter Segal license to indulge in crowd-pleasing anthropomorphic high jinks such as penguins in Hawaiian shirts and a high-fiving walrus a little of which goes a terribly long way.) Barrymore is Lucy Whitmore a sweetie pie with a penchant for treating her waffles like Lincoln Logs when Henry meets her in a local diner. They meet cute and get along cuter. The next day she has no idea who he is.This is because Lucy has no short-term memory the result of a car accident that banged up her and her fisherman father Marlin (Blake Clark) several months previously. The result is that its eternally October of last year for the poor girl a fact of which Marlin and Lucys steroid-addled brother Doug (Sean Astin) work strenuously to keep her convinced.Henry sees an easier way. After starting his courtship of Lucy each day from scratch -- the variations are sweet extremely funny stupid and occasionally all three -- he creates an explanatory video with which she can start her morning get over the necessary trauma and move on with her life. None of this is particularly believable but one doesnt come to an Adam Sandler movie for clinical realism especially when Dan Aykroyds playing Lucys doctor.Nevertheless theres a real charm to the notion that a couple might share a first kiss every day -- we should all be so lucky -- and the stars warm to it. ""50 First Dates"" offers the post-""Punch-Drunk"" Sandler appealingly lumpy confident instead of cocky and if not exactly mature at least aware maturity has its benefits.Outside of the protective bubble surrounding the two though its business as usual. Since Sandler is in romantic mode Schneider is tapped to provide the gross-out comedy. His performance as Henrys best friend Ula a ""wacky"" island burnout and fifth-rate Cheech will give giggles to the young and young of mind but its still an appalling bit of Hawaiian blackface hardly mitigated by the fact that Schneider is himself half-Filipino. Note to Schneider I wouldnt travel to the islands any time soon unless you want to get sent running back to Haole-wood.Much funnier is Astin in his first notable post-Sam Gamgee role as Lucys lisping muscle-bound brother -- a shrimp in an ill-fitting new beefcake body. Doug is a fully realized deeply silly character and the difference between Ula and him is the difference between a comedian and a comic actor. Whats most subtly pleasing about ""50 First Dates"" is watching Sandler himself step gingerly onto the high wire connecting the two.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.(""50 First Dates"" 1/2) (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"50 First Dates | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 50-first-dates ) 50 First Dates (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli 50 First Dates offers viewers a kinder gentler Adam Sandler. Gone (at least for one movie) is the narcissistic adolescent caught in a perpetual state of arrested development. In his place is a likeable goofball whose rough edges are worn off by a force more effective than sandpaper falling in love. Although there are moments that will tickle the bellies of longtime Sandler fans (one of which involves gallons of walrus vomit dripping from an individual of indeterminate sex) 50 First Dates is sweet enough to capture the attention and perhaps affection of those who would not ordinarily see a movie headlined by this particular star. The fact is 50 First Dates is more of a romantic comedy than an Adam Sandler comedy. Sandlers last romance Punch Drunk Love was deemed to be nearly unwatchable by his core constituency because they couldnt find anything funny in the way director Paul Thomas Anderson used their hero. 50 First Dates is more mainstream. The premise is a little off the wall but those who are able to buy into it will find that the movie takes them places. Anyone incapable of overcoming the significant suspension of disbelief hurdle will discover that the plot holes and inconsistencies accumulate faster than January snow in Buffalo. It took a little while but the films genial nature eventually won me over. If Memento represents the serious side of short term memory loss 50 First Dates stands in for the comedic aspect. (Its a cut above Clean Slate.) Henry Roth (Sandler) is a Hawaiian veterinarian who spends much of his free time seducing female tourists. One day while at breakfast he encounters Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore). They strike up a conversation and before they know it morning has become afternoon. Lucy has to go but she agrees to meet Henry the next day for breakfast. 24 hours later however when he approaches her she doesnt recognize him. The owner of the diner explains to him that as the result of an accident Lucy has lost her short term memory. Every night when she goes to sleep she forgets everything that happened to her the day before. Thus begins Henrys quest to win her heart even though he has to try repeatedly and never gets more than about 12 hours with her. In addition he has to deal with her overprotective father (Blake Clark) and flaky brother (Sean Astin no longer looking after Frodo). The only one on his side is a pothead named Ula (frequent Sandler flunky Rob Schneider). Theres an element of Groundhog Day in 50 First Dates. Both films feature characters who repeatedly live the same day. Because of Lucys memory loss she awakens every morning and believes it to be a Sunday in October. Her father and brother are enablers encouraging the fantasy in an effort to make her happy. But they wonder and worry what will happen when something occurs to permanently shatter the illusion. For Henry to have any hope to be with Lucy he has to find some way to help her connect with her recent past. That involves a video camera and a diary. The movie was made with fans of The Wedding Singer in mind although in my opinion this is a vastly superior effort. Sandler and Drew Barrymore develop an easygoing connection thats heartfelt enough to be romantic. Granted they dont exhibit white-hot chemistry but its suitably sweet without being too saccharine. Sandler has toned down his trademark obnoxiousness - his goal is for the audience to like him and by taking this approach he hits the mark. Barrymore mixes flower-girl charm with kick-ass girl power. Shes as tough here as in Charlies Angels witness how she beats the crap out of both Sandler and Rob Schneider. Unlike in The Big Bounce the flora and fauna of Hawaii dont upstage the actors. As I previously mentioned the script is far from watertight but director Peter Segal (who helmed the last Sandler movie Anger Management) does something truly shocking for this kind of movie a he gets us to care enough about the characters that the idiotic plot elements arent all that off-putting. If theres a downside its that aside from a few notable moments of outrageousness the comedy is both low-key and limited in its ability to generate laughs. Perhaps the biggest surprise of all is that the film doesnt resort to an easy cheat at the end. It plays things straight and still manages to satisfy making this one of Sandlers most appealing outings to date. 50 First Dates (United States 2004) Director Peter Segal Cast Adam Sandler Drew Barrymore Sean Astin Rob Schneider Blake Clark Screenplay George Wing Cinematography Jack N.

Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler over-emphasize the romantic aspects of their romantic comedy reunion 50 First Dates. By Darren Michaels Columbia Pictures Adam Sandler as a romantic leading man is a stretch to begin with -- even Sandler as a comedian is a stretch for anyone over 15 -- but the bigger problem with this movie is the dichotomy created by interspersing gross-out gags with cloying sweetness. By teaming with Drew Barrymore his Wedding Singer co-star Sandler probably has the formula that will expand his youthful male fan base and guarantee a profitable opening weekend. But neither the lovey-dovey antics of Sandler and Barrymore nor the juvenile humor coming from his fellow SNL alum Rob Schneider who plays his best friend and Lusia Strus whose creepy androgyny might repel kids keeps the forced plot from bogging down into tedium. There are enough jokes about vomit body parts and bad smells to keep the pre-teen set happy but with its fairly explicit sexual references the movie is not entirely appropriate for kids under 13. The premise has hints of Groundhog Day with none of its charm. Henry (Sandler) a commitment-phobic Lothario and veterinarian works at an aquatic park in Hawaii where he meets and beds a bevy of women seeking romance and excitement while on vacation. A classic player hell come up with a multitude of unoriginal excuses (hes married gay or a secret agent) to ensure theres no lasting attachment. Then in the midst of his love-em-and-leave-em antics he changes into a romantic bent on wooing Lucy (Barrymore) a lovely but slightly daffy art teacher he meets in a cafe. About the show 50 First Dates  (out of four) Stars Drew Barrymore Adam Sandler Rob Schneider Sean Astin Director Peter Segal Distributor Columbia Pictures Rating PG-13 for crude sexual humor and drug references Opens nationwide Friday When he learns she has a neurological disorder that has erased her short-term memory he must make Lucy fall in love with him anew every day. His methods grow exceedingly outlandish if not exactly humorous as he plays on her kindheartedness. In an unfunny scene he pretends he cant read grabbing her attention by sobbing loudly and lamenting his stupidity in the cafe where they meet daily. Lucys father (Blake Clark) and body-building brother (Sean Astin in a role light-years away from hobbit Sam) try to protect her from Sandler but eventually they see he is sincere. Sandlers casual almost lackadaisical movie approach contrasts with his determined character. If only he worked as diligently to win the audience over as he does to lure Lucy.

Or visit Popular Alerts for suggestions. Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- Remember the comedy ""Groundhog Day"" in which Bill Murray is forced to relive the same day time and time again? Well ""50 First Dates"" has the exact same premise with one big difference Its not funny. This pedestrian pic starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore never gets out of neutral and should have been left in park -- back in the junkyard. The film is set in Hawaii and Im sure everyone involved got a great tan not to mention all of that quality time with Don Ho. Sandler fans will once again find their hero displaying his wounded puppy-dog look and Barrymore fans will once again find her bubbly and appealing. Indeed this movie will probably enjoy a great opening weekend due to the marquee value of its two stars. Then it will drop like a stone down a deep deep sewer. Cute meetings ugly script The limp script by George Wing features Sandler as Henry Roth an arctic marine life veterinarian. Yes ""arctic"" in Hawaii. Wait it gets even better. Anyway Henry only dates women who are just visiting Hawaii never locals. He wants no emotional entanglements -- none that is until he meets the girl of his dreams Lucy played by Barrymore. To use the Hollywood vernacular they ""meet cute"" at a local diner. Lucy is fond of using her breakfast waffles to build little log cabins and Henry helps her make a waffle door using a toothpick as a hinge. See I told you it got even better. Among the co-stars in ""50 First Dates"" is Sean Astin (left) who comes way down from his ""Lord of the Rings"" performance says CNN critic Paul Clinton True love strikes and despite the fact that Lucy is a local art teacher Henry makes plans to meet her again the following morning. Here comes the big twist. The next morning at the diner Lucy has no idea who Henry is and rebuffs his advances. Workers at the diner quietly explain to Henry that due to a car accident on her fathers birthday the previous year Lucy has no short-term memory. So now the film is ""Groundhog Day"" meets Dory from ""Finding Nemo"" without the sharks or cleverness. Now Henry has no choice Hes forced to make Lucy fall in love with him every day day after day. And you guessed it. Every time they meet they ""meet cute."" Its enough to give you sugar shock. Pass the insulin. Bad news To really stretch this concept to the outer limits of sanity Lucys family enters the act. Her father Marlin (see? ""Finding Nemo"") played by Blake Clark and her brother Doug played by Sean Astin (in an unfortunate role after his triumph in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) recreate her final day of memory over and over again so she wont know about her handicap. Sandler with a walrus in ""50 First Dates."" According to our critic the walrus gets the best line in the movie. Every morning she reads the same newspaper (theyve had hundreds of copies made) plans Marlins birthday paints her fathers office and has breakfast at the same diner -- all the things she did on the day of the accident. How long can her family keep up the charade? How long can Henry and Lucy keep ""meeting cute""? How long can the audience stand this idiotic drivel? Too long too long and not long at all. To add insult to injury this film features a number of eccentric characters who are so contrived so stunningly stereotyped it defies description -- but Ill try. First is brother Doug a steroid-popping body builder with a lisp and no goals or ambition beyond making his gluteus maximus rival the Cliffs of Dover. Obviously Astin has a big mortgage and he cant live off his ""Lord of the Rings"" checks forever. Objectable character number two is Ula played by Rob Schneider hes a one-eyed beach bum stoner with numerous kids and an overweight wife who lives vicariously through Henrys love life. Then there is Henrys co-worker Alexa played by Lusia Strus. He or she -- no one is really sure which -- puts the make on everyone and everything. Sporting blond pig tails and a blank stare this androgynous character serves as a walking punchline thats punched far too often. Lets put it this way The highlight of the entire movie is when a walrus vomits all over Alexa. Now THATS entertainment. ""50 First Dates"" opens nationwide on the all-too-appropriate Friday February 13 and is rated PG-13.

Patricia Arquette in ""Little Nicky""? Joey Lauren Adams in ""Big Daddy""? For Sandler these costars arent love partners; theyre more like women who take in a stray puppy and patiently housebreak him. I dont mean to suggest though that Sandler lacks the qualities of a romantic star. He may favor gags that trade on bodily functions and bashed limbs but as a hero he has always possessed a streak of stubborn loyalty. He is nothing if not obsessive - and of course more than a little childlike. (Isnt that what his AstroTurf-on-a-coconut-shell hair is about? It makes him look 12.) Hes an elfin parody of a grown-up in love. Sandlers pursuit of Emily Watson in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" had the quality of a grade-school crush driven to maniacal extremes. If the movie for all its fascination lacked fizz that was due to its central imbalance He was a creature of stuttering fixation; she was all elegant sanity. In 50 First Dates an agreeably deranged romance with a geeks-in-paradise Hawaiian setting Sandler finally gets matched with a character who is every bit as moonstruck as he is. Maybe more so. Drew Barrymore with her giggly sweet smirk plays Lucy who lives in a permanent floating state of 24-hour amnesia. Each day she wakes up having forgotten everything that occurred the day before - everything in fact since the car accident that caused her condition. Over and over she engages in her morning ritual sitting in the booth of a tiki-shack breakfast cafe and building a sculpture out of waffles. Sandler as marine veterinarian Henry Roth is a baby-cheeked lothario in sandals and flowered shirts whose love life consists of seducing and then ditching one horny tourist after the next. Spying Lucy in that booth he attempts to make his move but the moment she announces how much she likes the smell of fish on his hands (it reminds her of her dad) she gives off a glow he cant shake. They agree to meet up the next morning - but of course when they do she cant remember him. The seduction has to start all over. Theres a glimmer of randiness to this daffy fusion of ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Memento"" since Henry if he chose to could attempt to sleep with Lucy in perpetuity turning her into the ultimate one-night stand. But Sandler once he gets past a few early signature gross-out gags (one features a tidal wave of walrus vomit) stares at Barrymore with a twinkle thats deeper more alive in its adoration than the look he had when he first teamed up with her in ""The Wedding Singer."" In this even sillier movie the stars have a goo-goo chemistry thats hard to resist. ""50 First Dates"" is fairly slapdash with only a semblance of the intricate rhymed structure of ""Groundhog Day."" Most of the comedy springs from jokes on the sidelines like Rob Schneiders Polynesian-slob routine or Sandlers assistant (Lusia Strus) whos like a transsexual KGB agent rejected by the Farrelly brothers or Sean Astin doing a weirdly original lisp as Barrymores muscle-boy brother who appears to have a crush on himself. Yet the movie for all its genial idiocy connects emotionally by tapping into the frustration of Lucys condition. Barrymore has such a flaky bedazzled charm that you start to get invested in seeing her rescued. Sandler confronted with a girl who cant remember him is forced to become the ultimate romantic a man who woos with every breath. As a comedy ""50 First Dates"" is standard Sandler but as a love story it left me pleasantly buzzed if not quite punch-drunk.
