The much-abused hero of this family-reunion comedy shares his first name with a Los Angeles restaurant chain best known for its chicken n waffles -- a delicious if artery-clogging combo. As soul food goes Roscoes signature dish still digests more smoothly and satisfyingly than ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"" an in-your-face double helping of fat jokes crude slapstick wacky Southern-black stereotypes and occasionally inspired improv -- sort of like a BET remake of ""Dan in Real Life"" in which Martin Lawrence gets smacked around a lot. Pics target audience should eat it up; others not so much. Lawrence plays successful Hollywood talkshow host RJ Stevens -- thats Roscoe Jenkins to his folks -- whos heading home for his parents 50th wedding anniversary celebration. Roscoe hasnt seen the family in nine years and auds will understand why upon meeting his gruff dad (James Earl Jones oozing authority) whos always given preferential treatment to Roscoes attention-hogging super-competitive cousin Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer). Rounding out the clan are Roscoes sweet-natured mom (Margaret Avery) and boisterously obnoxious siblings sly con artist Reggie (Mike Epps) tough-lovin family man Otis (Michael Clarke Duncan) and plus-sized diva Betty (the irrepressible MoNique). Generally unimpressed with his celebrity status Roscoes relations love nothing more than to torture him reminding him of past mistakes and opening the occasional (well-deserved) can of whup-ass when he tries to fight back. Also there to dredge up unpleasant memories and stir up competitive male hormones is Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker) the beauteous young woman whom Roscoe and Clyde fought over years ago. Predictably this doesnt sit well with Roscoes shallow fiancee Bianca (Joy Bryant who deserves better) a pampered-princess type who refers to their impending marriage as an ""alliance."" Roscoe also has a young son Jamaal (Damani Roberts) whos trotted out every so often to look cutely neglected and give this noisy aggressive movie some semblance of an emotional core. The ploy would be more successful if writer-director Malcolm D. Lee (""Undercover Brother"" ""Roll Bounce"") didnt swing at every comic target with all the restraint of two unneutered dogs in the throes of passion -- an image that incidentally comes directly from the movie. As the misunderstood Roscoe Lawrence gamely cedes the comic spotlight to Epps Duncan and MoNique -- skillful performers all and Lee often lets them run their mouths off long after the cameras would have ordinarily stopped rolling. While the effect is pretty hit-or-miss this directorial indulgence does yield some amusing off-the-cuff banter amid the general pile-up of physical pratfalls and cloying daddy issues. (Pic seems wholly unaware of the irony that Roscoe having never earned his dads love also mistreats his own son.) Louisiana-lensed production looks slick and professional; musically however pic veers between overemphatic emotional cues and a rap/pop/Ramp;B soundtrack that couldnt have been cheap.

Aside from that theres little to distinguish this oddly mean-spirited comedy about a television talk-show host who ventures back to his Georgia home for his parents 50th wedding anniversary. CLIP Take a peek at Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins Martin Lawrence plays R.J. Stevens a Dr. Phil-like personality who has changed his name and persona to hit the jackpot in Hollywood. But he remains bumbling old Roscoe to his home-spun family which includes Michael Clarke Duncan James Earl Jones and MoNique. For a movie shot primarily in Louisiana Roscoe relies on some tired cliches of the South. Cousins lust after one another chitlins are the meal of choice and everyone speaks in drawls that sound inspired by TheDukes of Hazzard. Stranger still director Malcolm D. Lee has populated his movie with some downright impious characters who turn their backs on children try to steal each others love interests and when necessary simply whale on each other. Two dogs are relegated to nothing short of a porn shoot (though they somehow maintain their dignity). There are a few moments of humor particularly when comedians Mike Epps and Cedric the Entertainer rib Roscoe for selling his soul (and appetite) to Hollywood. And Jones adds a dose of earnestness such as when he warns his son that the wedding anniversary is to be ""a family celebration not a Hollywood production."" Sadly Roscoe isnt much of either.

"Roscoe Jenkins Home is where the cliches are | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRoscoe Jenkins Home is where the cliches are Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins reinforces the sense that movies are not about real life but about other movies.By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. Feb. 8 2008(out of 4)Starring Martin Lawrence Joy Bryant Monique Nicole Ari Parker Cedric the Entertainer James Earl Jones. Written and directed by Malcolm D. Lee. 100 minutes. At major theatres. 14AWelcome Home Roscoe Jenkins reinforces the sense that movies are not about real life but about other movies.How many times in the long history of Hollywood have we seen the city slicker corrupted by power or snobbery finding himself back among the real people in the heartland of America? The down-home virtues of these people eventually set him straight.Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins is a black-themed variation of this Capra-esque standard - which means among other things that instead of the roast turkey around the family table we have corn bread collard greens and ribs.Article Continued BelowThe city slicker is Roscoe Jenkins a Jerry Springer-like television host played by veteran comic actor Martin Lawrence. Hes returned home for his parents 50th wedding anniversary..Along with him is his fiance Bianca Kittles (Joy Bryant). We know Bianca is the villain who will have to be cast out before harmony can reign among the Jenkins family because she practices yoga is a vegan who makes Roscoe drink beet juice and has an insalubrious past.""Baby Ive dated all kinds of men - athletes CEOs princes bad boys attorneys mob bosses - but Ive never connected with any of them the way I do with you"" she breathes into Roscoes ear.When this pair arrives in town the fun begins. And what fun In the course of being set straight Roscoe - deemed ""sissified"" and ""scrawny"" by his family - tumbles down staircases is sprayed by a skunk engages in a mammoth barroom style brawl with his cousin Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer) is punched in the face by his brother the sheriff and is even beaten up by his sister Betty (Monique). The latter pushes her comic specialty - the fat woman driven by unbridled lusts who believes she is alluring to men - for all its worth.Unhappily presiding over this comic spectacle is James Earl Jones who occasionally flashes his trademark alligator grin as if he were in a picture where that grin had meaning. His role a crusty but good-hearted patriarch is something he could do in his sleep.This is a moral tale of course. ""I believe in winning at all costs"" the feline Bianca hisses and Roscoe confesses to his family ""I thought I was a loser so I went away and transformed myself into what I thought was a winner.""Realizing his mistake he is ready to return to the city with a renewed sense of humanity and self-respect. The only question is how he expects to keep those virtues and continue to do his Jerry Springer act on TV.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(AP Photo/Universal Studios ... more Photo David Lee Review Welcome Home Mr. TV star 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins Comedy. Written and directed by Malcolm D. Lee. With Martin Lawrence Joy Bryant MoNique Margaret Avery James Earl Jones Mike Epps Cedric the Entertainer Damani Roberts Michael Clarke Duncan Nicole Ari Parker. (PG-13. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) On TV the hero of ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"" is known as Dr. R.J. Stevens a self-centered self-help guru whose outrageous talk show borrows a little from Dr. Phil and a lot from Jerry Springer. Back home in rural Georgia hes plain old Roscoe and anything but a superstar. Roscoes extended family puts a serious hurt on his inflated ego in this boisterous comedy from writer-director Malcolm D. Lee (""The Best Man""). The message - stay true to your roots - is solid and Lee gives his outstanding comic cast some sharp one-liners but he undermines the effort with crass humor mugging and slapstick. The title character (Martin Lawrence) is a single dad living the high life in L.A. - besides his hit program hes written a best-seller ""The Team of Me"" and hes engaged to a vain and ultracompetitive reality-show star Bianca (Joy Bryant). He hasnt been home to Georgia in nine years but partly prompted by guilt over neglecting his son (Damani Roberts) he agrees to attend the 50th wedding anniversary party of his parents (James Earl Jones Margaret Avery). Instead of treating Roscoe like royalty the folks at home guffaw and tease him about a variety of childhood humiliations he underwent particularly those at the hand of his cousin Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer) who always managed to one-up him and has now become an obnoxious and wealthy used-car dealer. Also on hand are Roscoes muscle-bound older brother (Michael Clarke Duncan) whos the towns sheriff; Roscoes motormouth sister Betty (MoNique); his scheming cousin Reggie (Mike Epps); and a stunningly beautiful woman Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker) whom Roscoe adored as a youngster but lost to Clyde. Roscoes old rivalry with Clyde flares up eventually leading to a face-off during a madcap obstacle-course race a tradition at the familys gatherings. Roscoe begins to notice Biancas many flaws and feels the old tug toward Lucinda. He also has to contend with his dads resentment that hes been away for so long plus the old mans disgust at his TV persona. Roscoes facade begins to crack and he lashes out at everyone only to be put down hard. Its pretty clear where this is headed and the sentimental ending is what youd expect. But getting there is a problem since writer-director Lee pumps the proceedings with slapstick involving fistfights groin smashing skunk spray in the face canine intercourse and obesity - adolescent stuff that seems borrowed from Lawrences ""Big Momma"" vehicles. Avery (and to a lesser degree Jones) who carries herself with some dignity seems as if shes in another movie. So Lee gets points for celebrating family values over those of bottom-feeder TV programs and (in the pictures better moments) for letting some talented comedians - Epps MoNique and Cedric are all stand-up veterans - riff off each other.

""We had an emotional lift in general"" Bobby Holik said of last nights belated reunion of Junes Stanley Cup champions. Sundays signees combined on a third-period goal initially credited to Niedermayer but claimed by Arnott and Arnott added another assist as the Devils opened their three-game California trip with a 5-2 victory over the Ducks. The victory lifted the Devils over .500 at 9-8-3 and on the road at 4-3-2. Winning the opening game of a back-to-back also for the first time this season the Devils make their first visit to the Kings new arena today. It was clear early that Niedermayer and Arnott will have to work hard to earn the big contracts that brought them back. Niedermayer led all Devils with 2344 in ice-time in his first game and Arnott saw regular duty while turning in a two-point night. ""Im a little tired. Ill see how I feel [today]"" Niedermayer said. ""I felt pretty good not 100 percent but it didnt take too long. You give a hit and take a hit and you feel that you havent missed too much."" Arnott played 1429 ample for a forward and nearly as much as Bobby Holik who returned the alternate captaincy to Arnott. ""Not too bad"" Arnott said. ""I was a little rough around the edges handling the puck. But as long as I kept my shifts short I was all right. There were a few times when I was caught out there though."" Niedermayer skated with Colin White and his first contribution was being tripped by Teemu Selanne giving the Devils their first power play which took only six seconds to convert. Both Arnott and Niedermayer moved right onto the power play which had fallen from the league lead by being blanked in its previous 14 chances over five games. Holik won the faceoff to Petr Sykora whose point shot rebounded to the right side for Patrik Elias eighth at 537. Elias goal was his third in four games. ""That warms the feelings a little bit gets you going. It made me feel part of it right off the bat"" Arnott said. Selanne answered at 809 of the first with his 11th the fourth shot in a flurry around Martin Brodeurs crease with Ken Daneyko and Ken Sutton unable to clear. Selannes flip from the front of the crease hopped over Brodeur sprawled in desperation. In the second the big guns missed great chances while it remained for Jay Pandolfo to put the Devils back in front with his first of the year. Alexander Mogilny fanned on a backdoor set up shot a semibreakaway into Guy Heberts chest and fell while trying to control another breakaway pass. At the other end Selanne missed a dangerous feed to the goalmouth off a rush and Marty McInnis shot another chance into Brodeurs sprawl. Pandolfos go-ahead goal developed innocently while the Devils were changing on the fly. Petr Sykora head-manned off the right boards and Pandolfo darted behind Pavol Trnka to reach the puck in the right circle immediately hoisting a backhand into the far top corner over Heberts waffle at 842. Arnott notched an assist on that goal. The Devils took advantage of a left shoulder injury suffered by Hebert when a teammate fell on him. Hebert did not leave the game after a trainers visit but was obviously hurt holding his glove arm tight to his chest. After the second faceoff the Ducks bench was ready to replace him but he remained in the net. The next faceoff came at the center dot after Scott Gomez gave the Devils a 3-1 lead wristing his fourth from the top of the right circle past Heberts unmoving glove arm at 1615. Hebert who was chased by the Devils in New Jersey Oct. 14 was then replaced by Dominic Roussel. Any suspense ended at 1201 of the third when Niedermayers point shot eluded Roussel.

Lee Comedy Romance PG-13 1h 54m By MATT ZOLLER SEITZFEB. 8 2008 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Back to the home he tried to forget Martin Lawrence left with Cedric the Entertainer in ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins."" Credit David Lee/Universal Late in ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"" a comedy about a talk-show host (Martin Lawrence) revisiting his relatives down South theres a scene in which characters sit in the family patriarchs living room playing video games. The scene is already funny because the competitors are playing on a bulky 1977 television while the heros recent gift to his father a flat-screen plasma set sits unopened in a box nearby. But the crowning touch is a throwaway detail The TVs knob is missing its button and in its place is a pair of pliers clamped over the metal stem.""Roscoe Jenkins"" is just a shaggy diversion that gives its energetic star and its populous accomplished supporting cast (including James Earl Jones as Papa Jenkins Margaret Avery as Mamma Jenkins and Cedric the Entertainer and MoNique as the heros siblings) a chance to clown around. But its a cut above other films of its type because every scene is packed with details like those pliers -- touches that suggest that the films writer and director Malcolm D. Lee (""The Best Man"") is working overtime to smuggle life into formula.Mr. Lawrence is apoplectic and affecting as Roscoe a braggart who now calls himself R. J. Stevens and whose cockiness masks his hurt over past and present miseries.His dad always favored Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer) an adopted child turned used-car impresario who won every prize Roscoe coveted including Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker sweet but tough) Roscoes childhood crush and Clydes current squeeze. Roscoes gossiping eavesdropping trash-talking sister (MoNique) stirs every pot and when called out by Roscoe silences him with a ""Raising Arizona""-level backside whupping.His fiancee Bianca Kittles (a gem of a performance by Joy Bryant) is a ""Survivor"" prizewinner who pressures Roscoes sweet-natured son Jamaal (Damani Roberts) to be more ruthless and whose scheming nature brings out Roscoes least flattering qualities. (Roscoe puts up with her because the sex makes him speak in tongues.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story You can see every twist coming Roscoes disenchantment with Bianca and his reconnection with his family; the tension between Clyde who treats the empathetic Lucinda as a possession and Roscoe who sees her as his salvation; the sequence in which the family members run an obstacle course and Roscoe must choose between helping his struggling son and heeding Biancas exhortations to abandon Jamaal and win the race. (The films vilification of Bianca is its least savory aspect; a story with this many screwed-up hypercompetitive characters has no business scapegoating one of them.)But its the gags that make or break this sort of film and ""Roscoe Jenkins"" is aces in that department from Clydes fits of comic weeping (he sounds like the Cowardly Lion) to the newly health-conscious Roscoes furtive sampling of forbidden barbecue (his sauce goatee gives him away) to the veteran scene-stealer Mike Epps as Roscoes hustling best friend getting a laugh simply by pronouncing the word Telemundo.The most absurd gag is a dog sex scene shot like something out of a soft-core film that pays off in subsequent images of those same dogs tenderly spooning. As the song says everybody needs somebody sometime.""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for crude and sexual content language and some drug references.WELCOME HOME ROSCOE JENKINSOpens on Friday nationwide.

Lee; director of photography Greg Gardiner; edited by George Bowers and Paul Millspaugh; music by David Newman; production designer William Elliott; produced by Scott Stuber Mary Parent and Charles Castaldi; released by Universal Pictures.

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday June 3 2008 1108 AM Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins. Comedy about a TV star who heads South for a rowdy family reunion. With Martin Lawrence Mike Epps MoNique. Director Malcolm D. Lee (154). PG-13 Crude and sexual humor language drug references. At area theaters.Having gotten all the sweetness out of his system with the 2005 sleeper ""Roll Bounce"" Malcolm D. Lee caters to a wider audience in his raucous reunion comedy ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins."" Hell probably find the success hes looking for. Spiking sentimental family values with crude hilarity isnt the recipe for an award winner but it will feed crowds hungry for a good time. Martin Lawrence is Roscoe a Jerry Springer-style talk-show host with the seemingly perfect L.A. life fame fortune and a gorgeous fiancee named Bianca (Joy Bryant). A recent winner of ""Survivor"" Bianca sees life as one big competition - which is fine since Roscoe does too. This attitude brings him success but it doesnt leave much time for family. Still at the urging of his son Jamaal (Damani Roberts) he reluctantly agrees to attend a 50th anniversary celebration for his parents (James Earl Jones and Margaret Avery) back home. Of course things dont go quite as planned once Roscoe arrives in rural Georgia. Though hes hoping for a heros welcome nobody much cares that hes a big star. In fact everyone seems far more impressed by Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer) Roscoes car-dealer cousin and longtime nemesis. Making matters worse Clyde is now dating Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker) Roscoes childhood crush. As his brother (Michael Clarke Duncan) sister (MoNique) and cousin Reggie (Mike Epps) point out Roscoe needs to decide where his home really is. In case that sounds a little too sugary keep in mind that Lawrences co-stars are more than ready to provide salty humor while creating a loose almost improvised feel. Although Lee relies on too many lame gross-out jokes this cast does know how to have fun - which may come as welcome relief to audiences desperate for laughs during a cold month at the movies.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint What will be the worst Martin Lawrence movie of the year? The competition is always fierce and its still early but we may have a winner in ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins."" A groundbreaking achievement in blandness the film has nothing other than a few ethnic references to distinguish it from the next lazy family comedy from Steve Martin. Lawrence plays R.J. Stevens a popular television relationship counselor who returns to his Southern home for his parents 50th wedding anniversary reconnecting his upscale celebrity with his down-home relations. The reactions of James Earl Jones Cedric the Entertainer MoNique and the rest of the clan range from reserved to openly hostile. They think that hes grown too big for his britches with his finicky high-maintenance fiancee Bianca (Joy Bryant ""Antwone Fisher"") and his big-city ways. Let the groin-whacking commence Written and directed by Malcolm D. Lee (Spike Lees cousin) the film teeters between neo-minstrel humor and sappy sentimentality. Lee was much funnier with his spy spoof ""Undercover Brother"" and more likable with the skate-dancing toss-off ""Roll Bounce""; here he flailingly attempts to grapple with questions of racial identity. Roscoe has abandoned the family name for a presumably more media-friendly one he shows up for the party in hideous plaid golf pants that scream WASP and his relatives accidentally-on-purpose mispronounce his girlfriends name ""Blanca."" Will R.J. be able to stick to Biancas string-bean cuisine diet or will he throw her over for his salt-of-the-earth ex-girlfriend (Nicole Ari Parker) and heaping plates of fried chicken? If you cant predict the answer how are you reading this newspaper? Modestly budgeted and massively dumb ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"" belongs to the sassy sistas and blinged-out playas school of comedy (maybe its a preschool come to think of it). Its great to see a studio release with so many black people in front of the camera and behind but it would be so much more satisfying if the project was something to be proud of. Isnt good comedy a civil right?

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Martin Lawrence. Love him. Same goes for Cedric the Entertainer. Theres a sweetness to both performers that endures even when onscreen shenanigans have them acting crazy naughty both. Casting them in a family comedy should deliver a romp not invite a rant. So what the heck happened to writer- director Malcolm D. Lees ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins""? RJ Stevens (Lawrence) is at the top of his game. His talk show is a ratings bonanza. His recent engagement to Bianca Kittles a ""Survivor""-type winner whos all about ""alliances"" has made him one half of an L.A. power couple. RATING | Family Comedy But when Stevens (nee Roscoe Jenkins) visits his people in the small Southern town of Dry Springs after a nine-year hiatus hes reminded that all hes achieved is nothing a trip home cant cure. Along for the self-help gurus journey of enforced self-discovery are Jenkins son Jamaal Bianca (Joy Bryant vibrantly game in her first comedic role) and her dog. Waiting to greet or cut him down to size are Mamma Jenkins (Margaret Avery) and Roscoes disapproving father played with a posture that still issues a challenge by James Earl Jones. There are also siblings Otis (Michael Clarke Duncan) the backwaters hulking but kind sheriff and Sister Betty. Its not immediately clear what she does. You can be sure played broadly by Monique whatever it is its gonna be loud. When Roscoe was a kid his family took in Clyde. Their bitter rivalry fostered by Pappa Jenkins continues to this day and throughout the movie. Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer) arrives with Roscoes childhood love Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker giving a nicely attuned turn). There are laughs. Anyone who loves sweet tea gets the gag when vegan Bianca chokes on Bettys brew. But more often the movie ditches clever for crass Monique and Mike Epps as opportunistic cousin Reggie provide most of the downhome and dirty entendres. Less nique would have fixed much of what ails this movie. Writer-director Lee has done better by audiences and his gift for wry observation ""The Best Man"" ""Undercover Brother"" even the nostalgia-driven ""Roll Bounce."" Here he seems to have ripped a page from Tyler Perrys redemption playbook. Only he flipped the script to make it less sacred more profane. Much more. Behold this years front-runner for The Norbit. This newly minted award (named for last years desperately crude Eddie Murphy comedy) recognizes a movie for pulling off a PG-13 rating when it deserves an R. Were this critic as suspicious as Dave Chappelles Conspiracy Brother Id wonder why the MPAA gave ""Superbad"" an R but this film pitched at the urban market a broader rating. Instead well just ask what good is an intergenerational comedy if you cant take your aging parents and shouldnt take the kids?

"Lights on but nobodys really home - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Lights on but nobodys really home Martin Lawrence and MoNique play brother and sister in this family humiliation comedy. (David Lee/Universal Studios via AP) Email|Print| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / February 8 2008 ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"" is a comedy that wants us to believe that James Earl Jones and Margaret Avery could be the proudish parents of Martin Lawrence Michael Clarke Duncan and MoNique. You cant ask comedy to pull that off when its science-fictions job. Then again realism gets beat up something awful in this movie. So do we. This is one of those your-roots-are-showing family circuses where just about everybody seems like a clown.Lawrence plays RJ Stevens a sub-Dr. Phil talk-show host and best-selling author (""The Team of Me"") who takes his snotty vegan fiancee Bianca (Joy Bryant) to Georgia for his parents 50th wedding anniversary. He hasnt been home in nine years which is plenty of time for the humiliations hes avoided to pile up.Before RJ even gets out of his first-class seat his white suit is covered in beet juice (which airline stocks that?). Hes forced to wear a pair of madras patch pants then an entire Cross Colors faux-African outfit which is perfect for a movie that feels like it came out 18 years ago. Both getups are only slightly more obnoxious than the movie itself.Eventually RJs successful car salesman cousin Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer) shows up. They resume their boyhood rivalry over Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker) the down-to-earth beauty whos still mysteriously available to them. The writer and director Malcolm D. Lee (""Roll Bounce"") has no apparent interest in developing this movie into even a moderately plausible tonally consistent entertainment. Hed rather show us two dogs having sex (which goes on long enough to be almost funny) or whip up senseless horseplay that ends in the destruction of Mamma Jenkinss kitchen. Oh and look out for that stream of skunk spray that hits RJs face. (Yup its that type of movie too.)Lee hasnt grown much as a filmmaker or a storyteller over the years. But my can he waste a very good cast. Here everybody stands around while one actor does his or her thing (usually its Mike Epps as a lewd cousin). Playing the eldest Jenkinss child Duncan is actually as funny as Epps and MoNique. He ought to get himself a real comedy quick.""Roscoe Jenkins"" never tries for passable adult laughs. Why is MoNique scrubbing her feet at the kitchen table? Why does Margaret Avery have to be socked in the head during the long long softball-game sequence? Why doesnt Mamma Jenkins have any control over her house? And that skunk . . . for real?Sadly the movies biggest burst of inspiration involves Lawrence and MoNique battering each other a la Eddie Murphy and Della Reese in ""Harlem Nights."" None of Lees attempts at satire work either. Bryant is supposed to be playing a cutthroat ""Survivor"" contestant and some joke on Paris Hilton (shes usually a pleasure to watch; not here).Its as if Lees taken the likable bawdy gags of his 2002 blaxploitation romp ""Undercover Brother"" and the ensemble charm of his 1999 romantic comedy ""The Best Man"" and dropped them on the Jenkins house like a cartoon anvil.

What kind of movie do you feel like? Ask Movie Mom Click here Trailer Ace the Case with Susan Sarandon Posted by Nell Minow 10-year old Olivia and her 17-year old brother are left home alone when their Mom goes on a business trip for the weekend. Olivia sees a young woman being kidnapped on the empty New York City streets. Her brother doesnt believe her and neither do the cops. So Olivia starts investigating on her own trying to persuade a cynical detective (Susan Sarandon) that she is telling the truth.

If we dont know where we are there may be jokes but it is not truly comedy. Writer/directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore are not people with a lot of ideas. Their ""21 and Over"" was pretty much the same movie as their ""Hangover."" And the big innovation here is that this time its girls-gone-wild instead of boys. But it plays like it was inspired by a couple of womens magazine articles about the impossibility of ""having it all."" The movie says it comes down on the side of not judging other mothers those who seem to be losing it and those who seem to be holding it together. The message is that its good to forgive yourself for not being able to be perfect all the time. And its important to understand that loving your children means letting them learn to be responsible and not doing everything for them. But those good thoughts are undercut by the unexpectedly sour triumph of the main characters with antagonists who must be shown as spineless or pitiful. The reality of womens lives is a target-rich environment for comedy and the reality of mothers lives is especially so. But this script is so lazy that it does not meet the level of basic cable sitcoms for originality and wit. They have more in 22 minutes than ""Bad Moms"" does in 101. This is a movie that is supposed to be about female empowerment. There are two specific instances that involve women telling their cartoonishly awful husbands that they need to take more responsibility for their children and their households. And yet this is a movie that consistently shows the PTA as apparently entirely made up of women with the exception of one man who is shown at a PTA meeting specifically so he can be humiliated in public by his wife. Funny. amiright? And this is a school that apparently includes elementary middle and possibly high school students does not notice when a mother does a childs homework and has a pot-smoking principal who cant stand up to the President of the PTA. What? ""Hangover"" worked because most of the movie was about dealing with the horrible consequences of a major sort-of-accidental bender. ""Bad Moms"" tries to persuade us that a bender and attendant irresponsible behavior are signs of liberation. The bender is a mild one no tigers or tooth extractions. On the other hand the issue of money is raised but in the kind of fairy tale way that suggests no one connected with the movie has had to think about how to pay for groceries -- or damage inflicted on a grocery store -- in a very long time. Were supposed to believe them when they talk about how much they love their kids and would do anything for them but they dont really seem to enjoy or support them. And newsflash -- jokes about foreskins butt stuff and girl-on-girl kisses as a sign of rebellion and edginess are so 1998. The one-dimensional characters are as follows Mila Kunis plays Amy the exhausted mom of two who boots out her childish cheating husband. Shes had no sex in years. Kristen Bell is Kiki the exhausted mom of four whose husband treats her like Cinderella. They have sex once a week (""After ""Blue Bloods"") but he is not very uh excited or exciting. And Kathryn Hahn is Carla the happy unreliable slut who does not even know what a standardized test is much less whether her son has to take and pass them. She talks about sex all the time but does not seem to be having any either. Christina Applegate is Gwendolyn the Mean Girl (with henchmen played by Jada Pinkett-Smith and ""Bridesmaids"" co-writer Annie Mumolo (who should have done a major rewrite here). One thing Lucas and Moore get right is the combination of the humblebrag and the insult-wrapped in a compliment handed out by the ladies who run the school. Yes when they flutter their eyelashes and say ""I dont know how you do it"" to Amy she understands that they mean ""Youre doing it badly."" And there is a lot to be said about impossible standards and judgey people especially when it comes to parenting. But that requires actually saying something not just pointing it out. Amy blows her top decides not to try to be everything to everyone any more and then when Gwendolyn lashes back involving Amys daughter (in the Bizarro world of this movie the head of the PTA is in charge of everything in the school) Amy decides to run against her on a platform similar to but less authentic than that of Tammy in ""Election."" Even in a PTA election someone has to propose something more than ""lets do less and not judge each other."" All four women are brilliant actors and comedians and make as much of this material as they can but they all deserve much better. Jay Hernandez transcends the thankless role of the hot guy making him the only male in the film who is not completely infantilized. Someone needs to put him in a leading man role. And someone needs to start putting women in the leading role of writing and directing stories about women or at least men who can do better than this. NOTE The highlight of the movie is the series of conversations over the credits with the actresses and their real-life mothers filled with exactly the wit and heart missing from most of the film. Parents should know that this film is crude and explicit language throughout including very strong and crude language drinking drugs sexual references and explicit nudity and comic peril and violence. Family discussion Who is responsible for the standard the moms felt they had to live up to? How would this be different if it was about dads?

During the boring parts of this movie I played a game I made up that I called ""Same or Different."" For example in one of the earlier Bourne movies our hero the once-amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) grabbed a limited-use anonymous cell phone for a particularly clever maneuver. In this one he grabs a small tracking device handily left out in a bowl like peanuts at a bar for happy hour. Same or different? Different because the first one was plausible and this one was ridiculous. The earlier films had exceptionally well-staged fight scenes that felt like real people who get out of breath and hurt each other and jockey for advantage. In the first moments of this film in addition to completely unnecessary jumps between five different locations around the world for no purpose he knocks out an enormous professional fighter with one punch. Same or different? Same answer as above.  And if we distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys by how much collateral damage they inflict on the world -- how many innocent bystanders get killed the answer here is more same than different. There are franchise films made for fan service and then there are those that do not even service the fans are merely a cash grab and retroactively devalue the franchise. This is a movie that asks us to believe that the head of the CIA and a Mark Zuckerberg-young titan of the worlds coolest social media company a sort of cross between Google and Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat decide to have a conversation of the utmost secrecy in a posh Washington DC restaurant the kind where everyone eavesdrops on the big shots at the next table especially reporters politicians and Hill staffers. The first three Bourne films transcended the action/spy genre with a gritty almost intimate feel far from the glossiness of James Bond and with an expanding deepening storyline that as the then-LA Times critic Manohla Dargis said began with the existential in ""Identity"" (Who am I?) extended to the moral in ""Supremacy"" (What did I do?). With the third film the question of culpability extended to the larger ""I"" of the government Who are we and what have we done? We will put aside for the moment the non-Bourne ""Bourne"" which mistakenly went in the direction of a secret government program that was more ""Captain America"" than Bourne with a mysterious ability-enhancing drug that removed the somber reality that resonated with the era of waterboarding and Abu Ghraib. There is plenty to explore and attempt to expiate now and the movie tries to touch on contemporary issues explored in far more compelling -- and terrifying -- terms in documentaries like Alex Gibneys ""We Steal Secrets"" and ""Zero Days."" It just doesnt do anything interesting with them while it is piling improbable motivations and preposterous situations almost as high as the carnage and wrecked cars. Parents should know that this film has constant spy-related action-style peril and violence many characters injured and killed including many innocent bystanders themes of government corruption and some strong language. Family discussion Who should decide the balance between privacy and security and how much information about those decisions should be public? What real-life events inspired this story?

Roscoe Jenkins says ""No man is a hero to his dad."" Whatever our achievements or status those who know us best do not see us as larger-than-life figures. Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins stars Martin Lawrence as a Dr. Phil-style self-help guru. When playing a know-it-all who gets his comeuppance as he does here Lawrence has few peers. He is as attached to his certainty as Jack Benny was to his billfold. Still Roscoe Jenkins labors too hard to wring too-few chuckles as this pop psychologist helpless on the occasion of his folks golden anniversary gets belittled by parents and ridiculed by siblings. Just like when he was a kid. Some movies straddle two genres. This film written and directed by Malcolm Lee (maker of the far superior The Best Man) is a Twister game hands and feet everywhere. With adult siblings reverting to childish competition Roscoe Jenkins haselements of the family-reunion farce. With the ultra-successful Roscoe bringing his fiancA(c)e (Joy Bryant) a reality-TV star home for inspection it likewise has themes of the meet-the-parents comedy. And with the psychologist who is clueless about his own life we have a physician-heal-thyself film. As if that werent enough Lee additionally crowds his three-ring circus with jugglers clowns and dancing elephants in the persons of Michael Clarke Duncan MoNique and Cedric the Entertainer as Roscoes siblings and cousin. As a rule I dont mind broad humor. But the widescreen isnt ample enough to fit the jokes here. As Roscoes parents Margaret Avery and James Earl Jones emerge with drawers undropped and dignity intact.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

The much-abused hero of this family-reunion comedy shares his first name with a Los Angeles restaurant chain best known for its chicken n waffles -- a delicious if artery-clogging combo. As soul food goes Roscoes signature dish still digests more smoothly and satisfyingly than ""Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins"" an in-your-face double helping of fat jokes crude slapstick wacky Southern-black stereotypes and occasionally inspired improv -- sort of like a BET remake of ""Dan in Real Life"" in which Martin Lawrence gets smacked around a lot. Pics target audience should eat it up; others not so much. Lawrence plays successful Hollywood talkshow host RJ Stevens -- thats Roscoe Jenkins to his folks -- whos heading home for his parents 50th wedding anniversary celebration. Roscoe hasnt seen the family in nine years and auds will understand why upon meeting his gruff dad (James Earl Jones oozing authority) whos always given preferential treatment to Roscoes attention-hogging super-competitive cousin Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer). Rounding out the clan are Roscoes sweet-natured mom (Margaret Avery) and boisterously obnoxious siblings sly con artist Reggie (Mike Epps) tough-lovin family man Otis (Michael Clarke Duncan) and plus-sized diva Betty (the irrepressible MoNique). Generally unimpressed with his celebrity status Roscoes relations love nothing more than to torture him reminding him of past mistakes and opening the occasional (well-deserved) can of whup-ass when he tries to fight back. Also there to dredge up unpleasant memories and stir up competitive male hormones is Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker) the beauteous young woman whom Roscoe and Clyde fought over years ago. Predictably this doesnt sit well with Roscoes shallow fiancee Bianca (Joy Bryant who deserves better) a pampered-princess type who refers to their impending marriage as an ""alliance."" Roscoe also has a young son Jamaal (Damani Roberts) whos trotted out every so often to look cutely neglected and give this noisy aggressive movie some semblance of an emotional core. The ploy would be more successful if writer-director Malcolm D. Lee (""Undercover Brother"" ""Roll Bounce"") didnt swing at every comic target with all the restraint of two unneutered dogs in the throes of passion -- an image that incidentally comes directly from the movie. As the misunderstood Roscoe Lawrence gamely cedes the comic spotlight to Epps Duncan and MoNique -- skillful performers all and Lee often lets them run their mouths off long after the cameras would have ordinarily stopped rolling. While the effect is pretty hit-or-miss this directorial indulgence does yield some amusing off-the-cuff banter amid the general pile-up of physical pratfalls and cloying daddy issues. (Pic seems wholly unaware of the irony that Roscoe having never earned his dads love also mistreats his own son.) Louisiana-lensed production looks slick and professional; musically however pic veers between overemphatic emotional cues and a rap/pop/Ramp;B soundtrack that couldnt have been cheap.

Not a wholly pleasant one - you cant call the Martin Lawrence comedy a genuinely good movie. The story is too predictable too pat its feel-good lessons telegraphed from the start. Director Malcolm D. Lee who also wrote the script has trouble bringing together disparate plot threads. But thanks to a spirited supporting cast you can call parts of Roscoe Jenkins genuinely funny especially compared with such Lawrence fare as Big Mommas House. Mike Epps in particular is hilarious as Lawrences hustler relative. But were getting ahead of the story which is this Lawrence plays the Roscoe of the title - though as we learn thats not his real name. Hes a talk-show host in Los Angeles somewhere between Jerry Springer and Montel Williams leaning a little more toward the former. His career gets a boost when he gets engaged to Bianca Kittles (Joy Bryant) a winner on Survivor whose ambition is rivaled only by her self-esteem. Roscoe a single parent just kind of plays along and allows Bianca to talk him into going back home down South for his parents anniversary. Not because shes sentimental. She sees it as a boffo media opportunity. Its at his parents house that we meet the oddball cast of characters that Roscoes been running from most of his life. Theres Reggie (Epps) always on the make; Betty (MoNique) constantly undermining Roscoe; and Otis (Michael Clarke Duncan) Roscoes well-grounded brother and the town sheriff. Then along comes Clyde (Cedric the Entertainer) Roscoes cousin who was raised with him. A childhood incident has left them fiercely competitive - despite Roscoes fame and fortune its Clyde who owns car dealerships whom the family considers a success. Their rivalry extends to (and was created by) their feelings for Lucinda (Nicole Ari Parker). What follows is a lesson in family love true happiness all that. No surprise at where the film leads. But there is some fun in getting there. Reggie is the funniest thing in the film though sometimes you feel bad about laughing. Epps plays him over the top often resorting - on purpose one assumes - to broad stereotypes that are nevertheless a riot. When hes paired with MoNique you dont know whether to laugh or wince. I nearly always went with the former. Bryant captures well the psychotic competitive streak we suspect remains when the reality-show cameras stop rolling. Lawrence is much more low-key than usual toning down his performance for most of the film. In his case thats a good thing. In Cedrics case however its a disappointment. He never gets going never seems fully invested in Clyde. Too bad - when hes rolling Cedrics really funny. Ultimately the movie works best as a series of isolated moments Reggies reaction upon mistakenly walking in on Betty in the shower for instance (I know I know but its funny). Nothing highbrow about it - but Roscoe Jenkins works best when it aims lowest. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Read his blog at goodyblog.azcentral.com.

Lee; Author Malcolm D. Lee; Release Date Wide 02/08/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 114; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Posted February 6 2008 -- 1200 AM EST In this broad comedy of familial bad manners Martin Lawrence stars as a Jerry Springer-ish talk-show host with a Survivor-winning fiancee (Joy Bryant) and a young son (Damani Roberts) he somewhat neglects. All three decamp to his parents house in rural Georgia on the occasion of the oldsters 50th wedding anniversary. There our celebrity-life-embracing hero is cut down to size by the relations he left behind including his abrasive sister Betty (MoNique) and big brother Otis (very big brother actually given that hes played by Michael Clarke Duncan). In short if you thought National Lampoons Vacation films were at least okay then Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins is a decent enough way to spend two hours. However as was the case with the Vacation movies the cast is never really made to break a metaphorical sweat. Lawrence is a genuinely funny actor and spiky stand-up but here he is often merely required to fall over -- or be sprayed by a skunk (a comedy trope that humor scientists now agree stopped being funny some time during the second Reagan administration). MoNique is similarly given little opportunity to show off her indisputable comedic chops though her freewheeling monologue during the closing credits hints at what might have been. The result may not smell nearly as bad as a skunk but it does give off the distinct whiff of underachievement.
