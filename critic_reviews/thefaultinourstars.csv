You bet there is. A minority of critics have already posted their too-cool-for-this dismissal of The Fault In Our Stars a movie that would dare push their emotional buttons and God forbid bring a tear to their eye. But from the ingredients alone its easy to see why the source material - the young-adult novel by John Green - was a bestseller. Cancer is not an easy sell. But the notion of young people going through experiences - both love and death - that patronizing adults cant fathom is. Every teen trauma is the end of the world but in The Fault In Our Stars it literally is. (Even Shakespeare knew that young love plus death equals boffo box office). The tone is set in the opening scene when odds-beater Hazel (Shailene Woodley) who should have been dead three years earlier from a thyroid cancer that spread to her lungs is diagnosed with depression ""a common side effect"" of cancer. ""Depression is not a side effect of cancer"" Hazel intones in narration ""its a side effect of dying."" Nonetheless Hazel clearly does need some cheering up. And the spirit-lifter turns out to be Augustus (Ansel Elgort) an aggressively charming member of a youth cancer support group (caricaturistically portrayed as a cheesy experience run by a Born Again who makes up impromptu songs about Jesus). Where Hazel believes only in oblivion Gus believes in... something most assuredly the notion that hell get the chance to be remembered despite having lost a leg (and his athleticism) to cancer. His texts are hilarious his spirit indomitable his smile semi-permanent his driving terrible to a slapstick degree. Apart from their natural attraction to each other Hazel and Gus have An Imperial Affliction a novel about young people with cancer (by an author Peter Van Houten who we eventually discover is played by Willem Dafoe). This meta plot-twist is the springboard for the movies journey to Amsterdam and some unexpected turns (plus a trip to the Anne Frank museum which may seem heavy-handed metaphorically but Im a sucker for bathos). Hazel and Gus are clearly in the words of Hazels mom (Laura Dern) ""a cute couple."" And theyre complemented nicely by Isaac (Nat Woolf) Guss wiseacre best friend whos already lost an eye to cancer and is about to lose the second (with his relationship with his girlfriend in the balance). Like Hazel hes the master of deflective sarcasm but even harder-edged. To some extent Woodleys Hazel seems to suffer from what Mad Magazine referred to in Love Story as ""Old Movie Disease"" - i.e. she seems to become more beautiful as death ostensibly approaches the oxygen hose in her nose notwithstanding. But it seems only appropriate. If Gen Y still has a heart (and the existence of emo music suggests it does) then The Fault In Our Stars could indeed become this generations Love Story - mildly implausible but genuinely moving.

Does That Make It Good? Review In The Fault in Our Stars Shailene Woodley Will Make You Cry. Does That Make It Good? Eric Kohn Jun 4 2014 335 pm erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk There are good tearjerkers that earn their emotional impact on audiences and bad tearjerkers that exploit them. Cancer dramas dance across this line with particular frequency. For every smart balanced portrait of living with illness like Jonathan Levines insightful ""50/50"" theres the grating form of bottled sentimentalism found in ""The Bucket List."" But its not always that cut and dry. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" provides an inoffensive if largely underwhelming counterexample An adaptation of Josh Greens bestselling 2012 novel it straddles the line between earnest weepie and a savvy deconstruction of one partly because everyone involved seems to resist its inevitable direction. Starring Shailene Woodley as a dying teen who finds love with a fellow cancer patient played by her ""Divergent"" co-star Ansel Elgort the movie hits all the obvious beats that are primed to make you cry from the shouting matches that devolve into tears to the tender moments pitched between tragedy and uplift. However director Josh Boone exercises a noticeable degree of restraint with these scenes and his cast plays along. Together they show just enough caution to make ""The Fault in Our Stars"" stand out for its valiant attempts at turning into the formula expected of it. Though it ultimately cant dodge that fate its fascinating to watch the filmmaker give it a try--with a healthy boost from his lead. Shot by ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" cinematographer Ben Richardson ""The Fault in Our Stars"" casts the world of Woodleys character Hazel Grace Lancaster with a delicacy that borders on rawness. Even the cheesier scenes are easy on the eyes; Richardson never pushes the visuals to brightly-lit soap opera extremes and neither does Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Webers script. Hazel who meets the suave Augustus Waters (Elgort) at a cancer support group and quickly falls prey to his advances often appears in closeup--drawing attention to the contrast between her gentle look and the breathing tube stretched beneath her nose which attaches her to an oxygen tank to sustain her failing lungs. Augustus who lost a foot to cancer-related surgery naturally sees past Hazels predicament and falls for her while her conflicted parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) watch from a curious distance. The ensuing plot is a relatively straightforward process of soul-searching that finds Hazel yearning for a trip to Amsterdam in order to meet the author of a novel she admires. With Augustus and Hazels parents help she eventually makes the trip and discovers the reclusive scribe (Willem Dafoe) in a disgruntled inebriated state. No surprise then that the solace the dying woman seeks comes from the true love she consummates over the course of her travels. This rather obvious device unfolds with a fair amount of predictability but ""The Fault in Our Stars"" constantly resists overdramatizing the mounting sadness that eventually overtakes the picture. The movie works hard to make you cry but its gradual manipulation is too lighthearted to justify much contempt. Boone gives the story a self-aware quality in Hazels believable embodiment of teenage angst ""The Fault in Our Stars"" only turns into a sob story once she decides to let it go there by confronting her deepest fears. Her romance with Augustus on the other hand strikes a series of falser notes--unless the perception of his infallible affection towards her represents her own perspective which is certainly a possibility in this mostly average product which is just solid enough to hint at greater nuances lurking beneath the surface. The movie capably universalizes Hazels plight by exploring a larger fear of mortality assailing its characters--and the catharsis involved in defying that fear--but eventually panders to the same wishy-washy genre conventions that it frequently works around. Yet scenes that are seemingly destined to fall apart from a passionate make-out session to Hazel confronting her parents about their plans after her death hold together mainly because the actors bring a visible conviction to their roles. But theres a mounting sense that they can only carry it so far before ""The Fault in Our Stars"" reaches its destiny. Youll either tear up or gag by its closing scenes; the savviest viewers will likely do both. Boones unobtrusive style takes cues from the subdued nature of the material but theres little about the movie that makes the filmmaking stand out. Instead it derives its chief strengths from a series of efforts to take the drama seriously mainly embodied by Woodleys onscreen investment in it. Though she already showed a capacity for embodying a wide range of emotions without overplaying them in Alexander Paynes far superior ""The Descendants"" the recurrence of that talent here suggests a process of smuggling involved in her performing abilities. Woodley has yet to carry a rich adult story on her own but ""The Fault in Our Stars"" shows a rare capacity to introduce mature ingredients to a scenario weve seen countless times before. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is unabashed in its efforts to make you well up but the tears come from a real place. Grade B- ""The Fault in Our Stars"" opens nationwide on Friday.

Sorry."" Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is dying. Thats the truth. Sorry. Augustus ""Gus"" Waters (Ansel Elgort) doesnt care. Thats also the truth. Sorry. Based on the beloved novel of the same name by John Green Josh Boones ""The Fault in Our Stars"" commits the ballad of Hazel and Gus to the big screen (kicking off with an apologetic voiceover from Hazel who promises to tell us only the truth) and sticking to the choppy emotional structure of the relentlessly popular YA novel proves to be the productions wisest decision. Despite some early missteps in performance and the cutting of an essential subplot the charming and touching film has plenty to recommend it and fans of the novel and newbies alike will likely find themselves moved (and dabbing their eyes) more times than they can count. Young Hazels perpetual illness has kept her away from most social situations and shes far more happy at home watching ""Americas Next Top Model"" and hanging out with her perpetually concerned parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell who are both excellent) than putting herself out there amongst her own age group. Being a teen is hard enough - being a terminally ill whip-smart teen sounds nearly impossible. But there is one thing that trumps Hazels discomfort at being around other kids which is seeing her parents unhappy and knowing that she will eventually die and devastate them Hazel agrees to attend a local support group for kids with cancer simply because it appears to (temporarily) please them. Hazel is without question or qualification a wonderful person and a character very much worth rooting for. Woodley is winning as ever in the film thanks to a role that requires her to fold in a bit of the star-making sarcasm that set her apart in ""The Descendants"" with her particular brand of quirky charm. Elgort however doesnt fare quite as well. His Gus isnt so much whimsical and weird as he is a former sports bro with a staring problem and a deep misunderstanding of what ""metaphor"" means. Perhaps this is what teens like - strangers who stare at them and trot around with unlit cigarettes between their cancer-ridden lips - but the films first act doesnt do Gus any favors and Elgorts performance feels more like a bad spin on the ""manic pixie dream girl"" trope just stuffed into basketball shorts. The pair meet at that forced support group - Gus is in remission but hes there to support his best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) who is about to lose a second eye to his own cancer - and slowly form a close friendship that seems destined to turn into love. The films first half is lovely and sweet and quite funny if perhaps just a bit too good-natured. While Hazels illness is never far from mind (she totes around a backpack that provides her with fresh oxygen and she even ends up in the hospital for a brief stay) the duos halting steps into Teen Relationship Territory are real and relatable. That of course eventually changes during the films wrenching final half one that hinges entirely on the various evolutions of both Hazel and Gus seemingly different health statuses. Perhaps thats the real magic of the film as Boones big screen take on Greens novel appropriately apes the flow of the book - one that feels almost disarmingly fizzy and fun for its first half (yes despite the cancer) before turning quite suddenly serious around its halfway point. Theres an infectious lightness to the films first hour that is both disarming and genuinely honest. Although most stories would mine Hazel and Gus age for maximum emotional violence - theyre just kids - ""The Fault in Our Stars"" doesnt shy away from flipping that on its head. Theyre just kids and theyre going to act like it too. Both Hazel and Gus can be silly and stupid and airheaded obsessed with texting and talking and sharing beloved bits of pop culture wild about each other and their future just like any other (cancer-free) duo of similar age. After all theyre just kids and while they might temporarily swoon at their thoughtless display of public affection in the Anne Frank House (the Anne Frank House you guys the Anne Frank House) its the kind of act only a pair of hormonally-driven teens could get away with whereas adults would be (and should be) shunned for such a bizarre and disrespectful spectacle. Gus habit of keeping an unlit cigarette between his lips - ""its a metaphor"" - is a wearing personality tic but it does help ready the audience for one hell of an actual storytelling device the kind that shakes up Gus Hazel and the trajectory of the film itself. Early on in the film Hazel shares her favorite book with Gus - ""An Imperial Affliction"" penned by the mysterious Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) who has never written another thing - and their mutual love for the book soon serves as a driving force in both their relationship and the films narrative. Desperate to fully win Hazels affection Gus plans a trip to Amsterdam to meet Van Houten who has sort of invited them to visit thanks to a newly-launched email correspondence. The anticipation the pair feels is palpable and their expectation that the trip will be a life-changing one is understandable but what they encounter there is shockingly different than anything they could have anticipated (and emotionally devastating to both them and the audience). As is always the case with book-to-film adaptations Greens source material has been snipped down a bit to fit into a nifty two-hour package and while most of the cut chunks arent missed (a subplot about Hazel discovering the fate of Gus other cancer girlfriend has wisely been excised along with the books deeper emphasis on the Waters family as a whole) the brief attention paid to Nat Wolffs Isaac and his own cancer travails stings and fans of his character will be left disappointed for the lack of attention and care paid to him. Still Scott Neustadter and Michael Webers screenplay is a crisp one and the screenwriters seem to be very much in tune with the source material. Greens book is beloved by the younger set and it occasionally feels as if the film is pandering to a teen-skewing audience with bubbly text messages and on-screen emails frequently popping up and a mismatched soundtrack thats heavy on popular acts and light on the kind of songs that add appropriate emotion (aside from some haunting songs by Birdy). The film has enough charm and humor to keep it appealing to a wide audience and dumbing things down doesnt feel particularly smart or canny and proves to be a minor distraction to an otherwise majorly entertaining feature.

The films linchpin is young Shailene Woodley (already the savior of several iffy projects including Divergent) an actor whose effortless way with real-girlness and soft exhausted voice turns her oxygen-tank-rolling Hazel into a fully fleshed-out teenage creation. Even as her character meets and falls for upbeat charmer Gus (Ansel Elgort Woodleys Divergent costar) in a support group theres believable banter between them that redeems a long-telegraphed outcome known to anyone whos ever waded into the salty pool of movies like Love Story. The lions share of the credit should go to restrained director Josh Boone showcasing his text-sending vulnerable duo (elsewhere he even manages to coach Laura Dern away from her smeary cry-face). But the original story faithfully honored is bolder than its setup implies A love of a shared novel leads the ailing couple to Amsterdam to meet its reclusive author (Willem Dafoe). Its a welcome interlude where the condition of personal suffering is expanded to include bitterness cynicism and even a political dimension when the lovers visit the Anne Frank house. Though supported by Woodleys subtle narration The Fault in Our Stars is relentlessly outward. Thats part of the books inspiring touch and even if some of the supporting cast comes off as merely functional onscreen the core of the tragedy comes to life in a heartbreaking way.

The movie which evokes classic cancer weepies ""Love Story"" and ""Brians Song"" is starry-eyed affecting and preternaturally wise. It certainly benefits from appealing leads ""Divergent"" siblings Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort star as cancer-afflicted teens. Tears will definitely be shed at multiplexes around the country. Wearing its sorrow on its sleeve the movie opens with a voiceover about sad stories. Promising not to sugarcoat the truth ""The Fault in Our Stars"" sprinkles fairy dust over it instead. See video Shailene Woodley Falls in Love With Ansel Elgort in New Fault in Our Stars Trailer The movie is glossy Hollywood sad -- cathartic without being too much of a bummer. Hazel (Woodley) and Gus (Elgort) battle health challenges but never really lose their looks engaging in an almost fantastical quest to see a reclusive author in Amsterdam while bantering with pal Isaac (Nat Wolff) and her concerned but never overbearing parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) on the homefront. They even meet cute in a cancer support group. Hazel who must wear a breathing tube and tote around oxygen goes reluctantly to appease her mother all but rolling her eyes at the gathering. When she bumps into Gus she is thrown off her game by his frank interest. The two begin a halting friendship that turns into romance. Hazel who considers herself a grenade capable of inflicting great emotional damage tries to keep him at arms length but Gus is not deterred. They bond over her passion for ""An Imperial Affliction"" a book about cancer and he introduces her to video games and sci-fi. See photos The Fault in Our Stars Premiere Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort John Green Hit the Red Carpet Once a jock he lost part of a leg but is in remission at the movies outset with Hazel more outwardly at risk. In the best YA style he takes on her quest to meet ""Imperial Affliction"" author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) getting an email response where she could not. After requisite obstacles -- cost doctors opposition -- the couple travel to Europe with her mom in tow. Its all too good to be true (except for the cancer part) until their disappointing meeting with the writer. The dismayed teens instead sight-see Amsterdam with the authors assistant as their guide. (Moms conveniently back at the hotel.) After their romantic interlude they head back home where cancer rears its ugly head.

The movie does not shy away from the morbid concerns of terminal teens who worry about their parents and their eulogy with equal import. It also addresses the very real concern that romantic interests will bail in the face of severe health issues. After watching pal Isaac split with the girlfriend that had pledged to always be there for him Hazel and Gus decide their watchword will be ""OK"" a fairly less definitive choice. Under the direction of Josh Boone (""Stuck in Love"" which also featured Wolff)  ""The Fault in Our Stars"" strains credulity at moments (its a bold move to have teens take their relationship to the next level after a visit to the Anne Frank house) and verges on cutesy in others. But it never gets cloying which is a testimony to the grounding influence of Woodley. Against all odds it even manages to end on an upbeat note.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 06 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Jun. 09 2014 405PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Jeff Boone Written by Scott Neustadter Michael H. Weber Starring Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort Nat Wolff Laura Dern Sam Trammell Classification PG Year 2014 Country USA Language English Im not sure how Id react if a pair of teenagers - even a pair like Hazel Grace (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort) started passionately kissing in the attic of the Anne Frank House - but I doubt Id start slow clapping. But thats what spectators do in Josh Boones tissue-shredding adaptation of John Greens young adult bestseller The Fault in Our Stars and while it may not conform to ones real-life expectations it certainly hews tightly to teen-flick conventions. Although ostensibly a movie about how two doomed lovers refuse to march to societys drumbeat when it comes to fatal illness - she has stage 4 cancer and hes also a survivor - Fault is at heart a full-throttle by-the-numbers tearjerker. The two principals are winningly almost impossibly loveable Woodleys unsentimental Hazel melting inexorably in face of Elgorts take-no-prisoners campaign of puppy dog persistence and Gus himself bearing a mile-wide goofball grin that would do the young Jeff Bridges proud.

By Margaret Talbot Green wanted to write ""an unsentimental cancer novel"" that offered ""some basis for hope.""   Credit Illustration by Bartosz Kosowski In late 2006 the writer John Green came up with the idea of communicating with his brother Hank for a year solely through videos posted to YouTube. The project wasnt quite as extreme as it sounds. John who was then twenty-nine and Hank who was three years younger saw each other about once a year at their parents house and they typically went several years between phone calls. They communicated mainly through instant messaging. Hank was living in Missoula where hed started a Web site about green technology. John was living on the Upper West Side while his wife Sarah Urist Green completed a graduate degree in art history at Columbia. He had published two young-adult novels ""Looking for Alaska"" in 2005 and ""An Abundance of Katherines"" in 2006 and was working on a third. Like the best realistic Y.A. books and like ""The Catcher in the Rye""--a novel that today would almost certainly be marketed as Y.A.--Greens books were narrated in a clever confiding voice. His protagonists were sweetly intellectual teen-age boys smitten with complicated charismatic girls. Although the books were funny their story lines propelled by spontaneous road trips and outrageous pranks they displayed a youthfully insatiable appetite for big questions What is an honorable life? How do we wrest meaning from the unexpected death of someone close to us? What do we do when we realize that were not as special as we thought we were? Green was more forgiving toward adults than Salinger was but he shared Salingers conviction that they underestimate the emotional depth of adolescents. Green told me ""I love the intensity teen-agers bring not just to first love but also to the first time youre grappling with grief at least as a sovereign being--the first time youre taking on why people suffer and whether theres meaning in life and whether meaning is constructed or derived. Teen-agers feel that what you conclude about those questions is going to matter. And theyre dead right. It matters for adults too but weve almost taken too much power away from ourselves. We dont acknowledge on a daily basis how much it matters."" Y.A. novels are peculiarly well suited to consideration of ethical matters. It seems natural when a high schooler like Miles Halter of ""Looking for Alaska"" is depicted struggling to write essays on topics like ""What is the most important question human beings must answer?"" Miles is equally preoccupied with girls and with collecting the dying words of famous people. (His favorite Rabelaiss ""I go to seek a Great Perhaps."") Though ""Looking for Alaska"" sold modestly it won the Michael L. Printz Award the American Library Associations honor for best Y.A. book of the year. At the time Green was living in Chicago working at the associations magazine Booklist where he had reviewed books in a peculiar constellation of subjects conjoined twins boxing and theology. Upon graduating from Kenyon College in 2000 Green had thought of going to divinity school and he worked for six months as an apprentice chaplain at a childrens hospital in Columbus. He found the experience almost too sad to bear and decided that such a life was not for him. Still he remained deeply interested in spiritual matters with one exception ""Is there a God?"" struck him as ""one of the least interesting questions."" After ""Alaska"" won the prize Green quit his day job. He got more writing done but he missed the intellectual camaraderie that hed always had with his peers. The YouTube project was in part an attempt to fill that void. (It was also a smart marketing stunt though Green could not have predicted how smart.) Hank had reservations about becoming the repository for Johns excess energy. He told me ""I found John exciting and smart and interesting but also a little dramatic. He gets frustrated easily. Hes anxious. Hypochondriacal."" At the same time he said ""John for me has always been the baseline of what was cool and valuable and important. If he liked a band Id buy all of their CDs and memorize them and become a bigger fan than he ever was."" In 2006 YouTube was entering its second year and people were starting to post video diaries which in their more theatrical moments looked like performance art staged in somebodys basement. John Green was a fan of several such series especially ""The Show with Zefrank"" which enlisted viewers in quirky projects such as dressing up their vacuum cleaners as people. Hank shared Johns enthusiasm for these experiments and it trumped any hesitations that he had. ""We really believed in the importance of online video as a cultural form"" Hank said. The Greens started posting videos several times a week under the name the Vlogbrothers. The project was less a conversation than an extended form of parallel play. They shared personal stories--John confessed that the only sports trophy he ever got was made by his parents and bore the inscription ""All-Star in Our Hearts""--but mainly they exchanged ideas. The brothers had signature preoccupations which they discussed with excitable urgency talking into the camera at tremendous speed. John discussed books existential anxiety and pizza; Hank was into science math and corn dogs. John invented a highly undignified ""happy dance""; Hank wrote and performed songs many of them about Harry Potter. The tone of their monologues ranged from goofily informative (how giraffes have sex) to wonkish (""Why Are American Health-Care Costs So High?""). Many posts dispensed adult wisdom but in a reassuringly modern way. In a post advising boys on how to charm a girl John jokingly said ""Become a puppy. A kitten would also be acceptable or possibly a sneezy panda""--an allusion to a popular clip on YouTube. But he also said ""If you can see girls as like people instead of pathways to kissing and/or salvation."" The Greens vlogs were filled with in-jokes and code words that rewarded dedicated viewing. ""D.F.T.B.A."" stood for ""Dont Forget to Be Awesome"" and John referred to his wife as ""the Yeti"" because she was much talked about but--by her choice--never seen on camera. When a brother broke a rule that theyd established such as posting a video longer than four minutes the other brother could impose a punishment. Hank once had to spend fifteen consecutive hours in a Target; John had to eat a generous helping of ""slobber carrots."" (His toddler Henry provided the slobber.) In February 2007 John was stuck at the Savannah airport and he spotted an arcade game called Aero Fighters. He initially misread the name as ""Nerdfighters"" and later in a video he started riffing what if Nerdfighters were a real game? As he put it ""The band geek would be like I will destroy your ears with my tuba And the theatre guy would be like I am an expert at sword fighting And the English nerd would be like Hmm I know a lot of Shakespeare quotes "" Why did people still pick on nerds anyway? Who did the popular guys have on their side--George W. Bush and Tom Brady? Green declared ""I raise you an Abraham Lincoln and a Franklin Delano Roosevelt and . . . an Isaac Newton a William Shakespeare a Blaise Pascal an Albert Einstein an Immanuel Kant an Aristotle a Jane Austen a Bill Gates a Mahatma Gandhi a Nelson Mandela and all four Beatles. We win."" Fans loved the term ""nerdfighter"" and started using it to identify themselves. Initially Green talked about nerdfighters with a hostile edge they stood against the popular people. But the word soon took on a more celebratory inclusive cast. Nerdfighters werent against anything; they were simply proud to immerse themselves in interests that others might find geeky or arcane. Indeed the nerdfighter community is strikingly civil and constructive for an Internet subculture. Through an annual charity event the Project for Awesome nerdfighters have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for one anothers favorite causes. Their comment sections on YouTube and elsewhere are filled with earnest suggestions for further reading and mock complaints that Green has made them care about a distant war that theyd been ignoring. Rosianna Halse Rojas a pioneering nerdfighter recalls the moment the concept caught on. ""It was like the formation of a nation"" she told me. ""Only we werent fighting anybody to do it."" On June 6th Twentieth Century Fox releases ""The Fault in Our Stars"" the movie version of John Greens wildly successful 2012 novel about teen-agers with cancer. ""T.F.I.O.S."" as fans call it has been on a Times best-seller list for a hundred and twenty-four consecutive weeks and has spent forty-three weeks as the No. 1 Y.A. book. The trailer for the movie which stars Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort has been viewed nearly twenty million times. Publishing executives talk about successful books as if they were lightning strikes but the popularity of ""The Fault in Our Stars"" was no accident. Nerdfighters who by then numbered in the millions were evangelical about it tucking notes into copies of the book and encouraging readers to join their movement. In fact ""The Fault in Our Stars"" reached the No. 1 position on Amazon six months before it was published when Green announced its title online. Many authors do pre-publication publicity but Green did extra credit he signed the entire first printing--a hundred and fifty thousand copies--which took ten weeks and necessitated physical therapy for his shoulder. In recent years whenever Green has appeared at a book signing he has been greeted by hundreds often thousands of screaming fans mostly teen-age girls. The weirdness of this is hard to overstate. Green is a writer and his books are not about sexy vampires. ""Stars"" is a novel about young people with a deadly disease; its title is taken from Shakespeare and it has an uncompromising ending. In the movie as in the book the lead character Hazel Lancaster wears an oxygen tube in her nose. Green did not write the films script but he was an informal consultant and it was important to him that the film retain this detail ""It flies in the face of the notion that romance particularly about teen-agers has to be straightforwardly aspirational as they always say."" Green now thirty-six is thin and tall with light-brown hair that shifts around like a haystack in a stiff wind; he often rakes his hands through it causing random clumps to stand up straight. He has the charm of the middle-school teacher you secretly thought was cute but he is no match for Elgort the twenty-year-old who plays Hazels romantic interest Augustus Waters. I attended a preview of the movie in Manhattan this spring. Thousands of fans had lined up for free tickets and after the screening they screamed when Elgort strode down the aisle for a Q. amp; A. But they screamed louder for Green. ""We love you John"" they called out. When Green told the crowd that though he was proud of the movie it wasnt his movie someone shouted ""But its your plot John""--which marked the first time Id ever heard heckling about the nature of authorship. One questioner who had to apologize for hyperventilating as she spoke asked the five actors onstage to name their favorite lines from the book. Woodley was partial to ""I fell in love the way you fall asleep slowly and then all at once""; Elgort cited ""The world is not a wish-granting factory."" I had never watched a movie in a theatre where there was mass crying--not discreet nose-blowing or stifled sniffles but wracking sobs. (I was not immune.) Green told me that he had loved and hated Erich Segals ""Love Story"" when he read it in high school and that he had wanted to write ""an unsentimental cancer novel."" A story about dying teen-agers would be too wrenching he decided if it werent also romantic and funny in a way that offered ""some basis for hope."" Much of the novels vibrancy comes from the first-person voice of Hazel which is irreverent but never nihilistic. After she reads online tributes to a girl whos died of cancer Hazel observes that the girl ""seemed to be mostly a professional sick person like me which made me worry that when I died theyd have nothing to say about me except that I fought heroically as if the only thing Id ever done was Have Cancer."" When Green initially tried to write about kids with cancer he centered the narrative on a young chaplain--""the worst kind of wish-fulfillment version of me."" The result he once said was ""like a terrible Greys Anatomy. "" Then in 2007 he became aware of a girl from Quincy Massachusetts named Esther Grace Earl who was one of the earliest nerdfighters. Esther had thyroid cancer as Hazel does in the book and was dependent on an oxygen tank. Green got to be friends with her online and later visited her in person. Green is careful to say that Hazel--whose middle name is Grace--is not Esther but Esthers father and sister have spoken appreciatively of how much Greens creation reminds them of her. Esther died in 2010 at the age of sixteen. ""I could not have written it without her friendship"" Green said adding that ""there is definitely something weird about her not being here to give her blessing or not."" (""This Star Wont Go Out"" a collection of writing drawn from Esthers journals letters and blog posts came out in January from Greens publisher Dutton with an introduction by him.) When Green finished the manuscript of ""Stars"" he and his editor Julie Strauss-Gabel felt that they had something special. Most Y.A. readers are girls but because Green is male and his first books featured boys as protagonists his new novel seemed capable of reaching both genders. ""Stars"" is a love story but Strauss-Gabel successfully pushed for a cover that did not look like a traditional Y.A. romance no pink no photograph of a pretty girl. Instead the title dominates and the background is blue. The stripped-down cover also meant that adults could read it on the subway without embarrassment. Adults have become big consumers of Y.A. fiction and Green treats his grownup characters with unusual empathy. Hazel worries a good deal about how her death will affect her parents ""There is only one thing in this world shittier than biting it from cancer when youre sixteen and thats having a kid who bites it from cancer."" Green gives Hazels mother not only a devoted temperament but a sense of humor; she watches ""Americas Next Top Model"" with her daughter and takes her to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author Peter Van Houten. Greens books seem calibrated for an era in which parents--vigilant and eager not to seem out of touch--often read the books that their children are reading. Lizzie Skurnick who runs a publishing imprint that reissues Y.A. literature from the past told me that ""Green writes books that are appropriate for teen-agers and for the adults who want books to be appropriate for teen-agers."" Such parents may be pleased that their child is touched enough by a book to cry over it but they dont want the experience to be too unsettling. Skurnick feels that Greens approach is a bit tamer than that of Y.A. authors from earlier eras Judy Blume Lois Lowry Richard Peck. In Katherine Patersons beloved 1977 book ""Bridge to Terabithia"" a fifth graders best friend dies alone in the woods after falling from a rope swing and there is little consolation in the form of either teachable ideas or romantic spark. ""John Greens books all have a point and a lesson"" Skurnick said. ""Theyre sophisticated points but theyre there."" In April I visited Green in Indianapolis. He has lived there since 2007 when Sarah took a curatorial position at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. In the Midwest the Greens added to their household in this order Willy a West Highland terrier; Henry their now four-year-old son; and Alice their daughter who just turned one. When Sarah was pregnant with Alice the Greens did a Google Hangout with Barack Obama during which they asked him which name he preferred Eleanor or Alice. The President demurred saying ""The main thing is tell either Eleanor or Alice not to forget to be awesome."" I was staying downtown and Green picked me up in his car a Chevy Volt to take me to his office and video-production studio in the Broad Ripple neighborhood. He was wearing a checked shirt jeans and Adidas sneakers with green-and-turquoise Argyle socks. At one point he told me ""I dont see why anyone would ever wear socks that are not Argyle."" Broad Ripple is as cute as its name. There are coffeehouses tucked into bright-painted wooden buildings and brewpubs in older brick ones. Greens office occupies the third floor of a solid Midwestern-looking building. Nearby theres an encampment of youngish homeless people known locally as the Bridge Kids and a weekly farmers market that makes an appearance in ""Stars."" At work Green has surrounded himself with people who are approximately as smart as he is but a lot calmer. When I asked Sarah how anxious John was she laughed and said ""The word very comes to mind."" But she said ""its part of his identity and the way he experiences the world and its not a wholly inward-focussed anxiety. It also helps him to be empathetic."" Green told me that he had been prone to ""obsessive thought spirals for as long as I could remember""--but hed had good therapy starting when he was a teen-ager and felt that his emotions were ""fairly well managed."" Besides ""from a novelists perspective the ability to cycle through all the possibilities and choose the worst is very helpful."" Vlogbrothers which has more than two million subscribers has become the anchor of an online empire. In 2011 after YouTube approached the Greens about doing additional series they launched Crash Course videos--short educational lectures with animation accompaniments. John handles the humanities Hank the sciences. The videos which have the jump-cut aesthetic and speedy delivery of the Vlogbrothers posts are the pedagogical equivalent of Red Bull shots and if you watched them all youd know a lot but youd also think you knew more than you did. Raoul Meyer a history teacher who taught John Green in high school and who now writes scripts for Crash Course is sometimes bothered when people say that John is the best teacher theyve ever had because in real life teachers tell you when youre wrong. ""This is delivery of content and we do a really good job of it but thats just one part of teaching"" he said. The walls of Greens office are covered with framed nerdfighter-themed art work most of which has been thrust into his hands at book signings. In one corner is an Aero Fighters arcade console a birthday gift from Hank to John. Another gift from Hank hangs on a nearby wall a photographic mosaic amassed from hundreds of images of fans of the ""nerdfighter salute"" a gesture in which the hands are crossed at the wrists in a way that makes actual fighting impossible. A video blog may not sound like an intimate medium but it has brought John and Hank closer. After the first year of Vlogbrothers they resumed other forms of communication; John told me that they now talk on the phone every day. ""If anything we talk to each other too often"" he said. ""Now our collaboration is so deep and our work together feels so intertwined that I cant imagine we were ever so distant. But we still need projects. We still dont talk about personal stuff."" They say ""I love you"" once a year--on Esther Day which is a holiday that Esther Earl asked nerdfighters to observe on her birthday. Her idea was that it could become a celebration of non-romantic love--a day when youd say ""I love you"" to people who dont often hear it from you. ""Oh and Happy Fathers Day."" Share Tweet Buy a cartoon John walked me into his inner sanctum where a grubby oatmeal-colored La-Z-Boy hulked in a corner. ""I know its not a physically beautiful item"" he said. But his mother gave it to him for his twenty-second birthday and he has written parts of all his books in it. ""It has moved successively farther from the center of our house"" he observed. ""In New York it was dead in the middle of the apartment."" A bookshelf held translated editions of his books. The Norwegian edition of ""Stars"" is called ""Fuck Fate."" Green laughed. ""That is arguably a better title than The Fault in Our Stars "" he said. ""Youve got to love Norway--you can put fuck on the cover of a young-adult book"" That morning Green was making a Crash Course video about ""Beloved"" the Toni Morrison novel. Unlike his Vlogbrothers posts Greens Crash Course videos are written not by him but by hired experts. He revises them however and as he read the script on a teleprompter he added jokes and asides. The video was being filmed by Stan Muller a tall broad-shouldered guy who answered a Craigslist ad placed by Green three years ago. Muller adopted the role of fond soothing parent. Green reveres ""Beloved"" but its harrowing--Sethe a runaway slave kills her baby--and he was worried about getting the tone right. In Crash Course videos Green often performs as Me from the Past a jaded younger version of himself who asks obvious questions. In the guise of this alter ego Green slouched in a chair and said into the camera ""Like do you think Beloved is a ghost or not?"" As his current self he complained ""Youre ruining it Me from the Past. We were having a moment there."" They stopped filming for a second and Green said hopefully ""That was kind of a joke. It was almost a joke. Its about to get really unfunny though."" One of his knees was jiggling. ""Oh man How about if I add You have a special gift for finding the least interesting question? Can I say that or is it too dismissive of a large body of scholarship? I dont care--I think its funny. Stan do you like it?"" ""I do"" Muller said. ""It is the least interesting question you can ask."" ""I agree."" Nerdfighters have a term for assessing the heights that Greens hair achieves when he worriedly tugs on it--""puff levels""--and this morning they were rising. ""Fuck its literally haunting this book"" he said. ""Like theres a ghost in the room."" It was a little surprising to hear Green use ""fuck"" so often because he is careful not to do so in his videos or his books. He continued reading the script evoking the books themes of dehumanization buried memory and love thats ""too thick."" He then described the moment when Sethe caught by her slave-owner takes her kids ""out back to the woodshed to kill them all before he can take them."" In an unusually slow voice he noted ""She only manages to kill one sawing through its neck."" Afterward he worried some more ""Gaaaaah. This is going to get like the least views of any Crash Course video ever made."" ""Nah"" Muller replied. ""Itll get a hundred thousand."" Afterward in Greens office we talked about the years of his life that might be chronicled in a Y.A. novel. He grew up in Orlando Florida where his father Mike was the state director of the Nature Conservancy; his mother Sydney stayed home with John and Hank when they were little then worked for a local nonprofit called the Healthy Community Initiative. Greens parents now live near Asheville North Carolina. ""They have goats and chickens and a vegetable garden and make goats-milk soap"" Green said. ""I was so worried about them leaving their home of twenty-five years and like an hour after they arrived they were the happiest theyd ever been."" In middle school Green said he was a regrettable combination a nerd who was not a good student. He was also bullied and unhappy. When he was fifteen his parents sent him to Indian Springs a boarding school outside Birmingham Alabama. It was an excellent move. Green had always loved to read--he had a soft spot for ""girl books"" like the Baby-Sitters Club series--but in high school he read Salinger Vonnegut Morrison and Chabon and found other people who liked to talk about books. Indian Springs offered the kind of verdant self-contained setting where one could have a preemptively nostalgic coming-of-age. You could almost feel yourself missing it while you were still there. Green captures this delicious melancholy in ""Looking for Alaska"" which tells a story of friendship first love and intellectual questing at a school very much like Indian Springs. Green was much happier in Alabama but he remained a ""genuinely poor student."" He told me ""I had always been told I was smart and had potential but I had never shown the ability to deliver on it. Its a bit cliche to say but I think I actually was scared I wasnt smart."" (After a beat ""I was actively bad at math. And languages."") Raoul Meyer then a young teacher at Indian Springs has a different take. He told me ""John was very vocal about his relationships with his friends being more important than his schoolwork. He broke a lot of rules--he smoked very visibly for instance and frequently got caught. You had the impression that if hed wanted to be an A student he could have been but that wasnt the identity he wanted."" The writer Daniel Alarcon was in Greens class and remembers that they both wanted to be writers then and ""shared a seriousness about it that wasnt exactly normal for adolescents."" Not until Alarcon enrolled in the M.F.A. program at Iowa was he again around people who like Green ""talked about literature the way other people talked about sports and who could break down a story over beer and not think of it as pretentious or boring."" Alarcon recalled a road trip to Orlando that he took with Green and Townsend Kyser the scion of a catfish-farming family. Once there they ""spent like a week writing oblique and inscrutable messages on construction paper and planting them in public places like the manicured lawns of branch banks."" At Indian Springs Green also became friends with boarders who staged brazen pranks. In one infamous episode someone invited a woman who was supposedly an academic expert on teen sexuality to speak at an assembly; in fact she was a stripper and started disrobing in response to the urging of a guy in the audience. In ""Looking for Alaska"" a similar incident occurs but the stripper is a man the student in the audience is a young woman and the whole stunt is an homage to a troubled girl who has died in a car accident--all of which makes it far more palatable. When Green was at Indian Springs a girl at the school was killed in a car accident. She wasnt a close friend but it was a small school and as he said ""its so hard to get your head around that when youre a kid."" He went on ""Infinite sets are a difficult thing to get your head around generally but the forever of it--I just felt so bad for her. I still feel so bad for her."" Although Green often suggests that he was a sad-sack dork as a teen-ager his old friends dont remember him that way. Alarcon said ""At our school we didnt really have jocks. It was a pretty high-achieving school. Im not saying it was paradise. Plenty of kids are socially awkward and theres nothing that will save them from other adolescents. But John wasnt like that at all. John was funny and charming and people looked up to him."" Green was sensitive and he fell hard for the girls he had crushes on but Alarcon said that ""John exaggerates his haplessness with women"" adding ""This is just speculation but if your fans are a lot of thirteen-to-fifteen-year-old girls it seems kind of smarmy if you come across like a ladies man."" Green enrolled in Kenyon in 1995. He chose a double major in religion and literature. His friend Kathy Hickner who also hung out in the religion department remembers him as ""one of these really huge personalities"" who was ""always talking"" but also as the person she could count on ""to go to church with me and discuss the sermon."" She added ""We were both into this whole layer of Christian thinkers who were very open-minded scholarly types."" Green continued to pursue writing particularly in an evening seminar that he took with the novelist P. F. Kluge who was Green recalled ""encouraging of my work but also very very critical of it--I once titled a story Things Remembered Things Forgotten and he said Green you dont get to title your stories anymore. "" When Green was not accepted into the advanced creative-writing course at Kenyon ""it was crushing"" he recalled. ""Kluge took me to his house and poured me a drink and said I think you should have gotten into the class. But your writing isnt that great. I think he called it a solid B-plus. But he said the stories that you tell during the smoke break--if you could write the way you told those stories then you would write well. "" Kluge told me that what he remembered most about Green was not his writing but his ""spoken energy."" ""He was so rapid-fire"" he said. ""Also decent self-deprecating and funny."" In class one evening Green read aloud a story with a sex scene in it. When he was done the other students offered polite critiques. Kluge then said ""Green youve never had sex before have you?"" Green said no. In subsequent classes he provided updates on the status of his virginity which for a long time was ""nothing new to report."" Upon graduating he moved to Chicago where he eventually ended up at Booklist. He was hired to do data entry but he found mentors in the editor-in-chief Bill Ott and Ilene Cooper a staff editor who also wrote childrens and young-adult books. Cooper said of Green ""He was a horrible slob and he didnt do his job all that well"" recalling that he failed to send out checks to freelancers. ""He was smoking but trying to quit so he was chewing tobacco which was kind of gross. But he was so engaging and he would want to talk about things like our place in the universe."" Greens older colleagues chided him for what Ott called ""some of his outrageous young-person pronouncements"" such as the claim that black-and-white movies are a waste of time. Ott said that he and Cooper who are now married saw him through a "" Sorrows of Young Werther-like downturn"" after a girlfriend dumped him; Green told me that Ott ordered him to watch the profoundly silly 1950 film ""Harvey"" which both lifted his spirits and cured him of his antipathy toward black-and-white. Eventually Ott started assigning Green reviews and Cooper did several edits on the manuscript of ""Looking for Alaska"" which she passed along to her publisher Dutton. When Green was twenty-six he met Sarah Urist who was managing an art gallery in Chicago. She had been three years behind him at Indian Springs and they became reacquainted through the woman Green was then dating--Sarahs sparring partner at a boxing gym. After Green and the girlfriend broke up he and Sarah started a friendship with a large epistolary component. ""We e-mailed back and forth for a year and talked about everything"" Green said. ""It was one of the most invigorating conversations I can remember having."" When I met Sarah she was wearing red lipstick black boots and tortoiseshell glasses; she is at once hipper than Green--shes grounded in theory and cutting-edge art--and steadier with a quieter more skeptical sense of humor. She left her job at the Indianapolis museum last fall and now works with Green on a Web series called ""The Art Assignment"" in which she showcases contemporary artists who then ""assign"" viewers to make a specific work of art. Sarah told me that she had an intellectual interest in fandoms like her husbands but found them difficult to identify with. ""Its a bias I have to get over because being a fan is so much a part of young life now"" she said. ""But theres part of me thats always wondering How much could you really love all of these things?"" One of the themes of ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is the relationship between authors and readers. Hazel says ""Sometimes you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book. And then there are books like An Imperial Affliction ""--Peter Van Houtens novel--""which you cant tell people about books so special and rare and yours that advertising your affection feels like a betrayal."" In a different era ""The Fault in Our Stars"" could have been that kind of cultish book. For many young people today however reading is not an act of private communion with an author whom they imagine vaguely if at all but a prelude to a social experience--following the author on Twitter meeting other readers collaborating with them on projects writing fan fiction. In our connected age even books have become interactive phenomena. Green for his part seems to feel that it is a betrayal not to advertise your affections. Every day he gives his fans a live stream of his stream of consciousness. In addition to posting on YouTube Green contributes indefatigably to Tumblr and Twitter. Even when hes feeling anxious hes willing to chat with people who approach him in public. As his fame has grown he has discovered the need for a few limits he doesnt like it when fans show up at his house or make Tumblrs about his kids. Greens boyishness and his energy make a lot of what he does look easy. But its hard for him to channel the emotional kid inside while remaining an analytical adult--to embrace simultaneously the voluble aesthetic of the Internet and the contemplative sensibility of the novelist. Raoul Meyer the history teacher told me ""John strikes me in some ways as the same teen-ager he once was just trying to figure out his place in the world. Only now the world is changing much faster and hes an agent of that change creating the world hes trying to fit into. And thats a tough role."" Greens online projects keep proliferating along with his fans and he seems determined to keep up with them all. He told me that he has sketched out some scenes for a new novel about ""two male best friends who live less privileged lives in a world of privilege"" and that he hopes to work on it after the movie junkets are over and he has taken a few days of vacation with his family in a Tennessee farmhouse devoid of electronic devices. One wonders however when hell actually find the hours to recline in the La-Z-Boy. E. Lockhart an acclaimed Y.A. novelist is an old friend of Greens. She said ""Most of us look at what John does and say Thats awesome but wed rather be in our pajamas writing."" On my second day in Indianapolis Green woke up early to record a Vlogbrothers video called ""Understanding the Central African Republic."" He supplied a staccato history of the recent conflict which he lamented had received little international attention because people are drawn to simpler narratives such as ""Harry versus Voldemort."" Nevertheless he concluded we ""have to make room in our stories for the world as we find it."" He filmed the video at home in the basement which doubles as a guest room and edited it at the office while stockpiling segments of yet another online series in which he plays a soccer video game while giving unrehearsed answers to such questions as ""What five books would you take to a desert island?"" At about 6 P.M. he posted the Central African Republic video and went home. Sarah was at the park with Henry and Alice so Green opened his laptop and checked out the immediate response to the video. Noticing two ""dislikes"" on YouTube he said ""How can they dislike it already?"" He responded to several comments typing rapidly and talking at the same time. Four or five times a month Green talks on the phone with kids who have cancer some of whom have requested the conversations through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Once every few months he Skypes with sick teens. That evening he had a Google Hangout scheduled with young fans from upstate New York--some from a high school and some from a support group called Teens Living with Cancer. We went downstairs and he set his laptop on the bed positioning his chair close to it. His screen soon filled with an image of a dozen teen-agers most of whom held copies of ""The Fault in Our Stars."" A boy named Brendan appeared and posed a delicate question about the distance that can arise between the healthy and the dying. Green said that people sometimes built a wall between themselves and those with chronic illnesses because it was easier for them to think of sick people as ""other."" He continued ""But if you are alive you are as alive as anybody else. And the full breadth of human existence is available to you. The wall is a lie."" When he finished he said ""Does that seem like a reasonable answer?"" ""Its a great answer"" Brendan said. After some nervous giggling about who was going next a boy asked Green if he had ever considered a different ending for ""The Fault in Our Stars."" ""The first ending I wrote was so epically terrible that I dont even want to tell you about it"" Green said. ""But I will. I mean you seem like nice people."" Green had told me about this ending and it was indeed a very bad idea--a Hail Mary attempt to avoid the inevitable conclusion. In the discarded version Hazel and Peter Van Houten go on a road trip in an attempt to honor Augustuss idea of an extraordinary life; they end up in Mexico where they unsuccessfully try to infiltrate a narcoterrorist organization. When Green recounted this to the group everybody laughed. ""Shut up"" he said laughing himself. ""Thats not nice It was a mistake"" The mother of a kid in the cancer-support group was participating in the Hangout. ""Your book was frustrating to me"" she told Green sounding polite but urgent. ""I want to know--what happened to Hazels parents?"" Green dipped his head. ""Youre going to be so mad at me"" he said. ""But I dont have an answer for that. I hope I left them in a place where its possible to go on."" From knowing Esther Earls parents he could say that ""loss does not end love in your life."" He added ""I genuinely believe that love is stronger than death."" Several people clapped but the mother looked unhappy and Green apologized to her. ""Its O.K."" she said. A smiling girl in a bright-pink shirt introduced herself ""Hi Im Brittany. Im fifteen and I had the same kind of cancer Gus has osteosarcoma."" John reached out his arms to give her a virtual hug. Brittany reached back and said ""You did an amazing job of capturing the fear the humor and the real pain of being a teen-ager with cancer."" Her words echoed something that Hazel writes to Van Houten ""As a three-year survivor of Stage IV cancer I can tell you that you got everything right in An Imperial Affliction. Or at least you got me right."" Afterward a teacher wrapped the session up and everybody waved. The screen went blank. Green put his head down on his arms and cried.

Comments (1) click to enlarge The Fault in Our Stars Video Rated PG-13  126 minutes  2014 Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber who wrote the superior teen romance The Spectacular Now reunite for this generous sensitively performed melodrama about cancer-stricken teens who fall in love. Like the earlier movie it was adapted from an acclaimed young-adult novel features Shailene Woodley as a lonely young woman who blossoms in her new romance and aspires to a gentle moony tone. Yet James Ponsoldt director of The Spectacular Now sculpted his dramatic effects with a scalpel; Josh Boone who directed this movie uses a chainsaw. An emotional climax arrives every 15 minutes or so and every affecting moment is underscored with a soppy light-rock song. With Laura Dern Mike Birbiglia and Willem Dafoe as a reclusive novelist based on Thomas Pynchon.

"The Fault In Our Stars starring Shailene Woodley reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Fault In Our Stars Didnt Make Me Cry--Am I a Bad Person? The Fault In Our Stars Didnt Make Me Cry--Am I a Bad Person? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 6 2014 706 PM The Fault In Our Stars I didnt cry once. What is wrong with me? By Dana Stevens Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort in The Fault in Our Stars Photo courtesy James Bridges/20th Century Fox Film Corp. Its not an enjoyable feeling sitting down to write a negative review of the movie about dying teenagers in love. The movie based on a beloved and critically praised YA best-seller by John Green starring the enthralling young actress (and doe-like beauty) Shailene Woodley. The movie in which a bright curious 16-year-old girl with metastatic thyroid cancer finds romance with an 18-year-old fellow survivor whos lost a leg to the disease. To remain for the most part unmoved by Josh Boones heartfelt adaptation of The Fault In Our Stars raises as many questions about ones character as about ones critical acumen. What in the name of God is wrong with me that I didnt cry once--I who just the day before wept through the entirety of my childs thoroughly upbeat school play. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. From the moment Woodleys character Hazel Grace Lancaster identifies herself in an opening voice-over as ""the Keith Richards of cancer kids"" The Fault in Our Stars is eager to display that it isnt one of those cancer movies not part of the tradition of the soapy ""sick flick"" in which beautiful young people--usually women--die far too soon but nobly and photogenically their distraught lovers by their sides. I dont doubt that for many viewers The Fault in Our Stars will succeed in subverting that model--it certainly allows its heroine more agency and better wisecracks than your run-of-the-mill Nicholas Sparks tearjerker. But for all the films best intentions--and a finely tuned performance from the ever-better Woodley--for me The Fault in Our Stars never entirely found its way out of Sparks territory. Maybe its simply that the pairing at the films center between Woodleys Hazel and Ansel Elgorts Augustus Waters never catches fire the way Woodley and Miles Tellers relationship did in last years exceptional high-school romance The Spectacular Now (written by Faults screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber). Elgort a tall loose-limbed handsome kid with a permanent bemused smirk is no match for Woodleys fluid expressive range (as we saw earlier this spring when they played brother and sister in another YA adaptation Divergent). You believe Gus would fall for Hazel but you have to take it on faith that his charms--which struck this viewer as slightly synthetic and stiff--would work on her. Advertisement Hazel is the only child of two loving anxious parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) who insist she attend a cancer-support youth group in the basement of a church (led by a sanctimonious Christian played by Mike Birbiglia). On her first night there she bumps (literally) into the eccentric Augustus (Elgort) a former basketball star who since losing a leg to cancer has taken to going around with an unlit cigarette in his mouth by way of letting the disease know whos boss. Gus is immediately charmed by this self-possessed unsentimental young woman breathing tube and all. But Hazel is wary to let herself fall for someone when she doesnt know how long she has left. Top Comment The reviews Ive seen are fairly positive but I must admit -- sometimes when I know something is designed to make me cry I shut down out of pure orneriness.  More... -JonDarrow Join In Once Hazel finally starts warming to the insistent Gus one of her first gestures of courtship is to persuade him to read her favorite book An Imperial Affliction--the account of a young girls struggle with illness that ends hauntingly in the middle of a sentence. Gus cashes in his wish at a Make-A-Wish-style foundation to offer Hazel a trip to Amsterdam where the books author Peter van Houten (Willem Dafoe) lives as a recluse. The impossible-to-embarrass Gus arranges for a meeting between Hazel and her literary hero. But instead of engaging with his delightful young fans questions a drunk van Houten insults her with astonishing cruelty ""Youre a failed experiment in mutation."" Even after this disillusioning visit Hazel and Gus manage to spend a romantic three days in Amsterdam strolling over the canals (she with her rolling oxygen tank in tow) dining by candlelight and at one point making out in the inner sanctum of the Anne Frank House--a breach of decorum thats mysteriously applauded by their fellow museumgoers none of whom seems to prioritize paying tribute to Holocaust victims over watching cute teenagers suck face. There are moments in The Fault in Our Stars that transcend formula and cut straight to the heart. My eyes did start to sting in some scenes between Woodley and Dern whose similar live-wire energy and lanky frames make them a convincing mother-daughter pair. Is there any way to watch Laura Derns incredible face crumple in grief without feeling yours crumple a little in sympathy? But in the films latter half--which not to give anything away goes to places even sadder than the already-bleak setup would suggest--Elgort really begins to bump up against his limits as an actor even as Woodley shines brighter by contrast. The soundtrack also grows more intrusive as the movie goes along laying so much schmaltzy pop under every scene that the music starts to crowd out the viewers ability to figure out for herself how she feels about all these tragic developments. Maybe it was that sense of emotional suffocation that lay behind my curious resistance to The Fault in Our Stars a perfectly well-crafted and well-intentioned tearjerker that failed to wring a single drop from these usually vulnerable ducts.

PHOTOS Summer 2014 movie preview But dont dismiss this drama as a chick-flick tearjerker. That only trivializes a refreshingly witty and tender romance for the ages. One that despite its few flaws will be cued up over and over even though that ending will never change. Scratch that. It will be cued up over and over because that ending will never change. Fans of John Greens 2012 bestseller know all this already -- and theyll delight in this extremely faithful adaptation. But for those who found the book somewhat cloying (cough cough) this film still succeeds on several levels. An excellent star-cementing cast has that kind of effect. PHOTOS Shailenes red carpet style Start with Shailene Woodley. Shes Hazel Grace a cynical introverted 16-year-old with a rare form of cancer that requires a breathing tube. Shed rather sit in her room and read her favorite novel An Imperial Affliction than socialize. To appease her parents (played by Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) she begrudgingly goes to a support group for fellow cancer patients. Thats where she sees him. A strikingly good looking high school senior and cancer survivor named Gus (Ansel Elgort). Hes cocky and has the moxie to unabashedly stare at her in the group then invite her on the spot to go home and watch a movie in his parents basement. Smooth. Hazel Grace behaves like most teen girls (and some adults for that matter) on the cusp of a potentially big love She holds vigil by her iPhone waiting for Gus to text her after their first date gets antsy when he doesnt smiles when he does then amps up her finest flirtatious banter to seal the deal. (The two decide quickly that their special word will be ""okay."") Soon the pair form an old-soul kinship -- and not just because of their illnesses. During picnics for instance they speak about her favorite novel and plot how to meet its reclusive Amsterdam-living author Peter Van Houton with a wry insight. They meditate on mortality without precious sentiment. (Not too much anyway.) Gus doesnt just want to know the meaning of life he longs for his life to have purpose in the world. Weve come a long way since A Walk to Remember everyone. PHOTOS Recent breakout stars Smart rapid-fire dialogue is a plus but lets get real This is the kind of story that hinges on the chemistry of the leads. And fortunately Woodley and Elgorts connection lights up the screen. Thanks to her warm smiles and his unflappable confidence its easy to see why the two care so deeply for each other. Together they sell their soul mate status and they do it with impressive emotional maturity. When they finally kiss its well earned. (Though the site of said kiss remains grossly inappropriate. What was Green thinking??). A word here about Elgort. A relative unknown who uh played Woodleys brother in Divergent the doe-eyed star is bound to reach R-Patz-like heartthrob status. And judging by the decibel-breaking screaming that greeted him when he ambled into the movie theater at the end of this particular NYC screening the actor may be already there. Hes like soooo dreamy. PHOTOS Costars reunited Hazel Grace and Gus are dealt a major setback of course. And its essentially and admittedly a long shameless Kleenex-fest. Yet the film goes to great lengths to mix comedy with the pathos illustrating that life does indeed go on -- and loved ones will be ""okay"" -- even under the worst of circumstances. Despite the tears audiences will leave with their hearts full of love. See? You dont always need vampires and factions to show teens in all their angst-filled acid-tongued and hopeful glory.

"The Fault in Our Stars (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Fault in Our Stars (PG-13) A touching love story between two witty teenagers battling cancer. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | coglemiamiherald.com6/5/2014 Editor rating 3 Fans of John Greens popular young adult novel are fully aware of the demands that come with seeing the movie version of The Fault in Our Stars. Do not arrive at the theater without a fistful of Kleenex a hand to hold (boyfriend or best friend) and enough self confidence to have no issue with weeping in public. The rest of you? Prepare yourselves accordingly. Adapted for the screen by the gifted two-man writing team responsible for The Spectacular Now and (500) Days of Summer The Fault in Our Stars -- a love story about two witty engaging teenagers with cancer -- is a heartbreaker for sure but its also a sweet romantic film full of sudden warmth and humor. It gets everything right about being young and in love for the first time from the shared secret codes that mean so much to the sheer physical joy of being close to someone who likes you. Best of all the film never makes its characters into stoic or tragic heroes choosing instead to highlight what makes them human -- their hopes their fears their anger the way they learn to live with knowing theyre going to die. As the film opens Hazel (Shailene Woodley of Divergent The Spectacular Now and The Descendants) has grown particularly adept at whistling past the graveyard. Diagnosed at a young age with thyroid cancer that traveled to and weakened her lungs Hazel is never entirely alone. Her constant companion is the oxygen tank she drags behind her wherever she goes though she doesnt go many places. Shes already got her GED and doesnt have many friends presumably because she has been in and out of hospitals since she was a child. Worried about her isolation and depression her concerned parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) nag her into attending a support group for young cancer patients. There she meets Gus (Ansel Elgort) the most charming 18-year-old ever to set foot on the planet. Heres how appealing he is Hes the sort of boy who puts a cigarette between his lips but never lights it a ""metaphor"" for spitting in Deaths eye. You can hear the teenage hearts pounding faster from here. Gus whose leg was amputated as part of his treatment is cancer-free when he meets Hazel; hes only at the meeting to support his best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) whos losing his eyes to another form of the disease. Hazel likes Gus cheery insouciance right away but is wary of any deeper feelings; an only child she already feels guilty enough about whats going to happen to her parents when she dies. But of course Gus and Hazel are young and attractive and some things are simply meant to be. ""I fell in love the way you fall asleep"" Hazel finally admits. ""Slowly and then all at once."" The plot is driven by the planning of a trip to Amsterdam to meet a reclusive writer (Willem Dafoe in full Drunken Unkempt Novelist mode) whose novel about cancer Hazel adores and has practically memorized. Some drama ensues over her health -- will she be well enough to travel so far? -- but the real power of The Fault in Our Stars lies in the simple moments between Gus and Hazel when theyre picnicking at a park watching kids play on a sculpture of a skeleton or joking around with Isaac or dressing up for their first grown-up date and beaming at each other over risotto. The key to any romantic movie is the chemistry of its stars and Woodley and Elgort who played brother and sister in the sci-fi adventure Divergent are simply terrific together. She lights up in his presence; he handles the most awkward dialogue about oblivion and love so deftly you almost dont notice its bit too florid to sound real. Also a standout is Dern as Hazels relentlessly upbeat mother who can never quite fully mask her ever-present tension and fear. Shes got positive thinking in a death grip which irritates the practical Hazel. The scene in which she finally acknowledges to her daughter that shes making plans for her own life after Hazels death is one of the films most wrenching and moving scenes (and this is a movie with plenty of wrenching and moving scenes). The Fault in Our Stars tells us we dont have to leave behind a legion of adoring fans when we exit this life. Just being truly madly deeply loved by a few good people is more than enough to make our existence worthwhile. Cast Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort Nat Wolff Laura Dern Sam Trammell Willem Dafoe.

"Die Another Day << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Map of the Stars  Next How to Watch the World Cup Like a True Soccer Nerd Facebook Twitter Print Movies Die Another Day Tom Cruise is unkillable in Edge of Tomorrow; Shailene Woodley radiantly incurable in The Fault in Our Stars by Wesley Morris on June 6 2014 Whos 3-D IMAXier than Tom Cruise? You can rattle off names but youre wasting your time because theres one answer nobody. I mean there are stars taller than he is. Theres King Kong and Godzilla and Marvel too -- I guess. But you dont even need IMAX for Tom Cruise. His grin is 72x54 feet and practically chattering on your lap. The screen itself is an occupational necessity. Trust me if Cruise could knock on your door and do his job at your kitchen table he would. And dont think for a second that some start-up isnt hunkered down in Mountain View working on a solution for that one. In the meantime thank god for digital reproduction right? The thrill of a movie like Edge of Tomorrow is in watching a star appear fully high on himself. No one is a bigger Tom Cruise junkie than Tom Cruise. He makes the Robert Downey Juniors and Matthew McConaugheys of the world look like Walter Cronkite. Were talking about something greater than egotism. Were talking a total and utter desperation to please. This time Cruise has sprinted the extra block to ensure that even his haters go home happy. In Edge of Tomorrow he keeps dying over and over jarringly hilariously triumphantly. The movie which Doug Liman directed takes perverse pleasure in knocking him off then reviving him. Each time Cruise jolts awake you get a jolt too -- unless youre a hater in which case all you get to do for almost two hours is suck your teeth. But the movie knows youre out there too For death no. 1 Cruises face melts through his skull. The excuse for the flesh sizzling is apocalyptic world war. Metallic-amphibious aliens dubbed Mimics have invaded Earth. Humanity teeters on ye olde brink of annihilation. And the planets nations have banded together as a combat complex called the United Defense Force. One of its generals a big humorless Irishman played by Brendan Gleeson informs Major William Cage (Cruise) that hell be suiting up and going to war. Cage is the sort of slick asshole that made -- and then kept -- Cruise a star. He used to run an advertising agency. Now he does PR for the Army. He sits in his officers uniform across from Gleeson and tries to slither out of conscription (his assignment is to lead the filming of the UDFs assault on the aliens on Normandy Beach). Cruise does that smug ""Oh I don think so"" laugh that because there are a dozen Cruisier things to talk about we usually overlook with him. But its right up there with Eddie Murphys rusted ""heh heh heh"" and Julia Robertss cackle. Its a well-done sequence that hits all the Cruise notes. He laughs. He gets prissily pissed (""I do this to avoid doing that"") and tries to blackmail his way out of his predicament. He leaps out of his chair and bolts for an exit. But there he is waking up in a vast barracks at Heathrow Airport still trying to talk himself loose -- only now as punishment for attempted blackmail Cage isnt even a major. Hes just another soldier on his way to fight. An American master sergeant (Bill Paxton) barrels around the barracks with Cage yapping up at him like a schnauzer pleading his case. It doesnt work. Before you know it Cage is fastened into a high-tech ""ExoSuit"" and with the rest of his platoon dangling from a gadget then dropped onto the modern-day mayhem of Normandy Beach. (Flagrant-allegory alert The invasion emanated from Germany.) Cruise has dramatically acted the horrors of war before. Here he risks playing the shock for a laugh running and shooting cluelessly amid real soldiers. Liman doesnt do a lot of slow motion. You assume he wanted to get out of Saving Private Ryans way while getting at the hyperreal chaos of a nonhistorical war. The movie provides a fresh sense of the utter lethal arbitrariness of combat What wont kill you? Cage lasts amid the death and destruction long enough to catch the arrival of UDFs most famous soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) before a Mimic wends from the sand and having been shot up spills acid all over Cages face. He pops awake at the barracks on the day of his arrival 24 hours or so before with a drill sergeant screaming ""Wake up maggot"" in his ear. On his second or third life Cage begins to collaborate with Vrataski who had the same mysterious thing happen to her. None of the whys or the hows of these resurrections are worth going into since they hold the enjoyably ludicrous keys to the larger plot. Edge of Tomorrow is based on a Japanese novel turned manga called All You Need Is Kill. The script is credited to Christopher McQuarrie and the brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and it gets off on deploying philosophical business about free will and being the ""master of your own fate."" Salvation here is possible only with autonomy. But you know its also a movie that has just as much to say about generic big ideas as it has time to glorify pop militarism -- so feel free to think about Aliens and the shooter game of your choice. This too was the premise of Source Code a 2011 Duncan Jones science-fiction thriller with Jake Gyllenhaal that addressed not at all tastelessly wishful antiterrorism. That movie did a lot with a little. It was like 24 dressing up as Vertigo for Halloween. Edge of Tomorrow is Full Metal Jacket taking two War of the Worlds and waking up inside a version of Groundhog Day thats been held hostage by Private Benjamin. I didnt know whod directed Edge of Tomorrow before I got there but the film has the confidence of someone who understands rising action and appreciates a grim kinetic sort of visual comedy. Of course its Limans name that came up during the closing credits. He can do good expensive-looking contraptions (Go The Bourne Identity) bad contraptions (Jumper) and ludicrous ones (both Mr. and Mrs. Smith and the gassy Valerie Plame thriller Fair Game which the Butterworths wrote are also his). This time Liman has a sharp script cleverly designed effects and an inspired editor (James Herbert) and cinematographer (Dion Beebe). The kick of a movie like this comes from the fun being had in its execution. It certainly doesnt come from originality. The finale uses Paris as such a Dan Brown-level amusement park that youre sad to discover that Opus Dei isnt behind the invasion. Otherwise its rare to get to one of these behemoth productions and discover that theres wit in the fuel tank -- formal wit. Its not enough for Cage to keep dying. The movie has to be clever about the deaths. The ""live die repeat"" power allows Cage to get some kind of narrative toehold. To master this scenario is to end what seems like a pretty ideologically vacuous invasion. The Mimics are just babysitting the source of their power. Ultimately this is a two-hour video game. But the filmmakers play it well. They bring energy to the repetition and the film comes through. Once Cruise is crushed by a crashing plane. Then hes wiped off the screen by a speeding Humvee. Eventually he stops lapping at the Master Sergeant and in each new life tries to convince the grunts and brass of his oracular endowment in part by finishing the sentences of other soldiers. This is all so Tom Cruise. Of course hes taking words out of other actors mouths But the movie has a very good time building layered rhythms out of his obnoxious exasperation. He doesnt have time for the guy from the BBCs Robin Hood to finish his lines; hes gotta save the world. Vrataski knows this and has even less time. Whenever Cage screws up out comes her gun. The visual music guiding these sequences is grimly comical Bang ""Wake up maggot"" Bang ""Maggot"" Bang ""Maggot"" Being the woman in a Tom Cruise movie has always seemed thankless. Shell almost never win. Rosamund Pike hit a new low in 2012s Jack Reacher playing a defense attorney so dumb that Cruise had to do all of her thinking. Its fitting that one of the few women to really push back is named Blunt. Sure shes shown at least three times rising up sweatily lustily from cobra pose. And I dont like her in this warrior mode -- graffiti on bus posters of Vrataski read ""Full Metal Bitch"" as if the kids thought she were Sigourney Weaver. It doesnt feel as if Blunt wants to be here but this is where the road of decent commercial parts takes you. So she keeps putting a gun to her costars head and making the most of it. But Cruise doesnt try to steamroll her. They become a comic unit -- although he does get around to looking at her in that way and all you hear is the clanging of pots and pans. No one wants to see these two do more than shoot and steer and impale stuff. He sells you the rest of it though the terror of operating one of those ExoSuits the disorientation the gradual exhilaration of mastering the time loop turning from petulant Cocktail Tom to the Tom who can fire weapons while spinning around the rim of a trench. All it took was dying about 75 times and each time being relieved to open his eyes and still be even more himself. There will be people annoyed that he keeps waking up at all. But theres almost no one else whod keep trying this hard to die on our behalf. Death hovers over The Fault in Our Stars. The entire movie hums with the harsh chilly light of a hospital. Its a romantic comedy about adolescent cancer patients so the grim glow doesnt feel like a strategy so much as a side effect. The first thing its 16-year-old heroine Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) says is ""This is the truth. Sorry."" That seems right for a film whose characters are shot so that they barely cast a shadow Theres nowhere to hide. Hazel has stage-four lymphoma and an oxygen tube in her nose.  She conducts herself with the bitter poise of a Bronte character who adores being a Bronte character. Her parents (Laura Dern Sam Trammell) coax Hazel Grace into a support group. Thats where she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort) a long bright-faced kid with amusing self-confidence. His cancers in remission but hes there for his friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) whose own cancer is on the verge of taking his second eye. Augustus slips a cigarette in his mouth and Hazel Grace assumes hes mocking the matter at hand. But no he says The cigarette is a metaphor for what cant kill him. They begin trading text messages. She makes him read her favorite novel something awful-sounding called An Imperial Affliction. He says ""How would you like to go on a picnic with me?"" It goes on from there. Mom and dad dotingly watch as these two fall for each other and a trace of pity is detectable in all their love. The stars are crossed but doom isnt whats drawing Hazel Grace and Augustus to each other. It really feels like love one defined by circumstances that set them apart from the majority of their peers. What a strange movie. A trip to Amsterdam leads to a kiss in Anne Franks attic that inspires applause from the surrounding visitors. The whole film is like that appallingly romantic. I cant recall anything this close to both an after-school special and a European art-house tragedy in its flat ugly style and emotional nakedness. Its reminiscent of Say Anything ... or when the terrifically oddball Wolffs around the latter 30 minutes of Ferris Buellers Day Off. Its not as competently made as either of those movies and for too long its more posturing and glib. But if I spent an hour rolling my eyes the final 20 minutes were devoted to contemplating blowing my nose. The film was adapted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber from John Greens best seller and was directed by Josh Boone. Green wrote the most inescapable book since the Harry Potters. Its covering peoples faces on the subway. Its dog-eared on coffeeshop tables. Its jutting out of book bags. For every 20 pages of pretentious back-patting prose theres a line of resonant simplicity like ""I fell in love with the way you fall asleep."" It sits on the young adult shelf but its mass appeal makes sense. It is in its way a rebellion novel fuck this disease fuck pity fuck dying. The movie picks up where Green leaves off fuck filmmaking. The poor shotmaking and the too-close close-ups are a trial. At some point were staring at a wall for five seconds before a character opens a door and stands in front of it.  And yet -- and yet -- theres something about the performances that gets to you. Its point-blank earnest. Dern and Trammell spend the movie looking like theyve just donated kidneys to unicorns. Theyre being more than they are acting. So are Woodley Elgort and Wolff. Woodley is like vintage Debra Winger self-possession that refuses to fall to pieces. It takes a while to get used to her bristling independence -- sort of the way you had to come around to Ione Skyes air-dried approach to intelligence in Say Anything ... . Elgorts even better. In Divergent he played Woodleys brother. But this is the more believable relationship. He gives every line a sweetness. I didnt remember him from Divergent right away and assumed that his artificial leg was real that he was some kind of miracle discovery a self-confident lug who could effortlessly embody besotted decency. Theres a moment when the breeziness powering the story goes away and medical reality takes over and Elgorts performance goes to a surprising new place. This is acting (and moviemaking) that has almost nothing to do with conventional norms of ""good."" Its pure and true and just vividly there. The shock is that eventually there you are with them wiping away the suds and snot.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The altogether lovely romance ""The Fault in Our Stars"" -- based on the best-selling young-adult novel by John Green -- shows what a franchise behemoth can do to actors and why intimate dramas offer them -- and us -- illuminating insights into our tiny yet vast worlds. Big movies have their embedded lessons in heroism but its nice to have tales of human-scale fortitude. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort play Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters 18-year-olds who meet in a cancer-support group. A survivor of osteosarcoma he has a prosthetic leg. Diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 13 she has the constant company of an oxygen tank. The two actors also portray brother and sister in the blockbuster dsytopian adventure ""Divergent."" Woodley is in fact franchise heroine Tris Prior. As strong as she was in the launch of the franchise some of the stunning nuance that made her a break-out in 2011s ""The Descendants"" was dwarfed by the enormity of the production. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" underscores what a fine sense Woodley has of the authentic. ""Honest"" describes her gifts. And as the narrator of her and Gus story Hazels not one to hold back. In an early scene at the cancer-support group Gus has just confessed his greatest fear is ""oblivion."" Hazel has news for him.Oblivion eventually comes if not today in thousands of years. You will be forgotten at some point like it or not. It sounds callous but Gus just smiles his knowing beatific smile. This is a breakout turn for Elgort whose warmth and intelligence soften but never blunt the films vital edges. Hes a young man with a crush a prosthetic leg and grand designs. ""I intend to live an extraordinary life."" Directed by Josh Boone ""The Fault in Our Stars"" follows these bright teens with opposing -- though hardly clashing -- approaches to cancer and mortality on their stirring tender and funny journey. They are not alone on that adventure Laura Dern and Sam Trammell play Hazels loving not impossibly doting parents. As Gus best friend Isaac also a cancer survivor Nat Wolff has the kind of goofy-sincere appeal so familiar to John Hughes teen flicks. Willem Dafoe makes a sharp-boned impression as the hard-tippling recluse Peter Van Houten author of Hazels go-to book. ""An Imperial Affliction"" the story of a girl with cancer ends abruptly and Hazel has always wanted answers. Hazel and Gus pilgrimage to see Van Houten includes a telling trip to the Anne Frank House. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" was adapted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber writers of one of the best films of 2009 ""(500) Days of Summer."" Like that movie ""Fault"" manages to be suspicious of romantic cliches even as it embraces the woes and wonders of love be it romantic parental or filial. When the film starts Hazel is lying on a lawn gazing up at the stars her voice-over telling us what kind of romantic story this wont be and what kind of cancer tale it might be. Consider that fair warning. Listen and you can safely guess whats coming. And yet the movie doesnt fill us with dread. Nor does it exploit its opposite hope. Standing in the kitchen Hazels father tells his daughter shes never been a burden. Had she been they would have left her ""at an orphanage with a note pinned to your pajamas"" he says. ""We are not sentimental people."" The next shot is of a worn-out swing set in their backyard. At times we are all weirdly sentimental people.

James Bridges/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of I recently overheard two teenage girls chatting up the movie version of ""The Fault in Our Stars"" after viewing its trailer. ""Im going to cry"" said one looking very happy. ""Me too"" said her friend looking even happier.For those friends and millions more Im sure the movie will no doubt be a cryfest for the ages. John Greens 2012 young adult mega-bestseller about two teens from a cancer support group was in effect already a movie. (It cried out to be filmed.) Now that its on the big screen translated fairly intact are there enough handkerchiefs in the world to staunch the flow?To their credit director Josh Boone and screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber dont pile on the mush. The film is highly manipulative all right but in ways that allow the audience a modicum of self-respect. The sniffling legions at the screening I attended neednt have felt like fools. Recommended 15 book-to-film adaptations coming in 2015 I might have joined them if I did not sense that on some level all this anguish was intended to be therapeutic. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is the ultimate feel-good movie about feeling bad. And within those limits it succeeds all too well. Theres even a long sequence in the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam which fills out the woe to mythic proportions. 15 book-to-film adaptations coming in 2015 Monitor Movie Guide As Hazel Grace Lancaster who spends practically her entire time hooked up to an oxygen tank Shailene Woodley gives an ardent nuanced performance. As her (eventual) boyfriend Augustus a high school basketball star whose leg has been amputated Ansel Elgort has been encouraged to act so charmingly that you just know (even if you havent already read the book) that bad times are nigh.Augustus is a Galahad dreamboat - every teen girls fantasy boyfriend. Hes worth being afflicted for. If he had been less of a fantasy the movie might have been grittier and even sadder but clearly thats not the vibe the filmmakers were going for. They want credit for being hard-hitting and they are. But they also have stars in their eyes. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for thematic elements some sexuality and brief strong language.)

Photo Credit James Bridges advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two young cancer survivors fall in love. PG-13 (mild language brief sexuality) BOTTOM LINE Flash-flood warnings are in effect now that this teen tear-jerker has finally opened. Strong performances from Woodley and Dern make it almost bearable. CAST Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort Laura Dern Willem Dafoe LENGTH 205 ""The Fault in Our Stars"" a romance about two dying teenagers wears its cynicism the way many young people do awkwardly and not very convincingly. That however may be its selling point. Just like John Greens shrewdly written best-selling novel Josh Boones film version strikes a snarky jaded self-aware attitude only to collapse into a puddle of poetry and tears. In other words ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is aimed with dead-on accuracy at the teenage heart. Its heroine is a 16-year-old thyroid cancer survivor Hazel Grace Lancaster played by a very good Shailene Woodley in a hard-won performance. Nasally intubated and smothered by her parents (Sam Trammell and Laura Dern both brief but moving) Hazel is the bitter one in her support group the girl who meets every positive vibe with a blast of Beckett-esque bleakness. Hers will not be the story ""where beautiful people learn beautiful lessons"" she warns us in the movies opening voice-over. ""This is the truth. Sorry."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Hold that brutal thought because in saunters dreamy Augustus Waters played by Ansel Elgort (Woodleys co-star in ""Divergent"") with a tad more smarm than charm. Confident and poised -- even on his prosthetic leg the result of osteosarcoma -- Augustus zeros in on Hazel and quickly begins breaking her brittle facade with sledgehammers of sincerity. A fan of the grand gesture he whisks her to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author. That reclusive misanthrope played by an alarmingly weird Willem Dafoe wont be the only downer on an otherwise romantic getaway. This is a love story as old as well ""Love Story"" the gushy novel-turned-blockbuster from 1970. In fact thats exactly the kind of movie that this movie is pretending not to be. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber of ""(500) Days of Summer"" has moments of emotional depth and gallows humor (Nat Wolff plays a video-game fanatic losing his eyesight) but theres something dishonest about its anti-Hollywood real-deal posturing. The flowery speeches and conventional literary references (Shakespeare Dickinson) create a veneer of profundity but the movies real mission is pretty basic to send another generation sobbing from theaters.

"The Fault in Our Stars falls short of its promise review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Fault in Our Stars falls short of its promise review You cant really criticize The Fault in Our Stars for wanting to turn on the waterworks as it inevitably and understandably does. But it promises something it doesnt deliver.Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley star in The Fault in Our Stars.  (James Bridges / The Associated Press)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 5 2014The Fault in Our StarsStarring Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort Laura Dern Sam Trammell Nat Wolff and Willem Dafoe. Directed by Josh Boone. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. 125 minutes. PGYou cant really criticize The Fault in Our Stars for wanting to turn on the waterworks as it inevitably and understandably does.Its adapted from John Greens bestselling young adult novel about teens finding love in the time of cancer and no hanky box will be left unplundered. The heartless and cynical need not apply.Article Continued BelowStill it bears mentioning that director Josh Boone doesnt live up to the promise of the films early going when it seems it might head in a less predictable and tear-jerking direction.""This is truth ... sorry"" Shailene Woodleys self-referential Hazel says at the outset as she admirably sets out to prove herself as ""the Keith Richards of cancer kids"" rather than just a pity case.Shes a whip-smart 16-year-old who has managed to hold lung cancer at bay thanks to an experimental drug but permanent breathing tubes and a portable oxygen tank remind her of the diseases constant threat.Hazels devoted parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) worry about her mental health. They insist she attend the hilariously righteous support group sessions at a local church which she reluctantly but dutifully does.At least she gets to hang with cool kids like Isaac (Nat Wolff) who isnt going to let incipient blindness stop him from being a ladies man.And she meets the slightly strange but impossibly cute Gus (Ansel Elgort) a basketball star who lost a leg to cancer and who pretends to smoke cigarettes as his way of giving the finger to the big C and ""oblivion.""Gus is smitten Hazel is cautious -- and for about the first hour this combination works its charms even though Elgort isnt half the actor that his fellow Divergent alumnus Woodley is. The determination of this pair to live life to the fullest not matter how short their lives may be is ennobling and even entertaining with screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber co-scribes on 500 Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now providing some fresh and believable dialogue.But then the story shifts to Amsterdam and whatever intention Boone and his producers had of making this a different kind of cancer movie -- something like Jonathan Levines 50/50 in other words -- ends up in the nearest canal. Everything turns completely to treacle replete with heart-tugging visuals and a soundtrack of insipid pop that might have been written and sung by a basketful of angels and bunny rabbits.Not even the presence of the estimable Willem Dafoe as a drunk and cranky author in no mood to pander can save the film from its determined slide into syrup.Its here that Elgorts limitations as an actor are most painful to watch since his constant smirk doesnt readily convert to a frown. Conversely its also here that Woodley really proves her worth. She has dramatic chops that shell put to good use in a better movie.As I said at the outset its not that The Fault in Our Stars is so terrible and theres nothing wrong with wanting a good cry at the movies.But it promises something that it doesnt deliver and insincerity is the last thing you want in a film like this.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort and Nat Wolff. (Photo/Video Fox) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com June 5 2014 446 p.m. ET 1 COMMENTS Almost half a century ago ""Love Story"" a weeper that was destined to become a national obsession began with the deathless words ""What can you say about a 25-year-old girl who died?"" Now ""The Fault in Our Stars"" seeks to become its successor with a new story of doomed romance. What can you say about a movie that brings two beautiful teens together in a cancer support group? That its stars do what theyre asked to do in one case faultlessly; that its ambitions are equaled by its contrivances; and that those contrivances however shameless are partly offset by the beauty of Shailene Woodleys portrayal of the heroine and narrator Hazel Grace Lancaster whose love of life is as palpable as the disease that threatens to kill her. Hazel has a fondness for straight talk. Shes depressed she tells us in a preface but not because depression is in the conventional wisdom a side effect of cancer. ""Its a side effect of dying"" she says ""which is whats happening to me."" Living with cancer-ravaged lungs she is tethered to an oxygen bottle wherever she goes and wears a nasal cannula a little two-pronged piece of plastic that delivers the oxygen to her nostrils. (In a fleetingly affecting detail Hazel checking herself out in a mirror before her first visit to the support group adjusts the cannula like a fashion accessory.) The boy who becomes the love of her life Augustus Waters has a penchant for expansive talk. Cancer-free after losing one leg Gus is insistently sometimes insufferably verbal and as played by Ansel Elgort almost preposterously handsome. Looking like an Adonis is hardly Mr. Elgorts fault but neither is the heros windiness. In John Greens phenomenally successful young-adult novel Gus is partial to big words and fancy locutions but theyre a cover in a nuanced character for the existential terror that his cancer will come back. In the movie the arc of Guss character is drawn with a brush so broad that it smudges. He eventually reveals his vulnerability and movingly so but before that Mr. Elgort is encouraged or indulged in posturings that make the hero an annoying presence and a baffling one a visitant from some weird preppie culture . More The Fault in Our Stars Ansel Elgort and John Green at the WSJ Cafe How Ed Sheeran Joined TFIOS Soundtrack John Greens Teen Revolution The John Green Glossary Does the Film Depart Too Much From the Book? Nuance isnt part of the productions program. The director Josh Boone goes for maximum emotional impact most of the time and usually gets what hes after. (The music by Mike Mogis and Nate Walcott should come under the campaign to outlaw large sugary drinks.) Theres no question that the movie will be a huge hit both because of and in spite of its manipulations the most flagrant of which--taken directly from the book it should be said--uses Anne Franks life to heighten our feelings about Hazel. Still moments of grace punctuate the film which was adapted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. (They wrote last years ""The Spectacular Now"" a romantic comedy with much more of a spontaneous independent spirit in which Ms. Woodley gave another endearing performance opposite Miles Teller.) Laura Dern as Hazels mother spends most of her screen time exuding brittle jauntiness but her defenses crumble in a mother-daughter confrontation about what happens if or when Hazel dies. Hazel rises fiercely to another confrontation with a novelist played lugubriously by Willem Dafoe who proves to be anything but the wise man shed been seeking. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is Hazels story and it is Ms. Woodleys movie at almost every moment shes on camera. She has the precious gift of simplicity whether shes observing the people around her with a cool eye or filling the screen with a warmth that seems to come naturally. Others in the cast work at being winning; she wins by seeming to be herself. Thats putting her achievement too simply of course. What leavens the heaviness of the theme is the heroines wry wit which Ms. Woodley deploys just as naturally. And when the time comes for suffering the pain of watching her is mingled with the pleasure of a performance that transcends contrivance. This young actress is the real heart-piercing thing. Watch a clip from the film ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Starring Tom Cruise Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) Edge of Tomorrow Never has a megabudget sci-fi spectacular been hung on a loopier premise but ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is great eccentric fun until its intentional repetitions get to be well repetitive. The premise is literally loopy. At a time in the future when our poor planet is being pummeled by seemingly invincible--and extremely unpleasant--alien invaders Tom Cruises Maj. William Cage a desk jockey determined to remain one finds himself plunged into a suicide mission. Worse still hes killed on the first day of combat. Much much worse still--though better for Mr. Cruise because hes so lively in the role--Cage finds himself caught in a time loop that has him fighting and dying fighting and dying over and over again. They could have called it ""Die Another Day"" but that title was taken. They might also have called it ""Groundhog Day 2"" but that wouldnt have conveyed the films martial frenzy its fascinating intricacies or the special delights of its borderline-comic tone. The comedy or more properly the odd levity doesnt kick in for a while. The combat that keeps killing Cage has echoes of World War II and for that matter ""Saving Private Ryan."" Weve lost France and Germany to the alien hordes so our last resort is a chaotic landing on a French beach. Only gradually does the reluctant warrior come to understand the bizarre terms of his existence--he has acquired the ability to reset time--and the chance it may give him to warn his superiors of the carnage thats certain to come. Little by little hes able to bend circumstances to his will and then to join forces with the most illustrious of the human warriors a woman named Rita Vrataski whos written thinly but played to the Valkyrie hilt by Emily Blunt. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" was directed with energy and elan by Doug Liman; hes best known for the first of the Jason Bourne films but he also directed a disjointed sci-fi curiosity called ""Jumper."" This movie adapted by Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth from a novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka is neither disjointed nor jointed; it is what it is an ingenious elaboration of a set of givens that like all time-travel plots dont fully withstand scrutiny. And dont merit comparison except in the most obvious sense to ""Groundhog Day"" whose hero undergoes moral and spiritual growth. The growth in Maj. Cage is practical and tactical; he only learns how to save the world while establishing some sort of liaison with fearless Rita in the process. (The impressive production was designed by Oliver Scholl. Dion Beebe did the cinematography.) Its worth noting that Mr. Cruise already saved the world from aliens in ""War of the Worlds"" then saved it more recently in ""Oblivion."" All the same ""Edge of Tomorrow"" gives him a chance to reinvigorate his career and he grabs it. (Reinvention isnt in the cards at this point and anyway who else could he be?) An action hero who has made running a subspecialty he runs with charming clumsiness at first a sort of Walter Mitty in a combat exoskeleton. Then bit by bit and day by day the dazed and confused Cage finds his rhythm and Mr. Cruise hits his stride. Its a rousing spectacle interspersed with touching moments of really hard trying. Watch a clip from the film ""Obvious Child."" Starring Jenny Slate Jake Lacy and Gaby Hoffmann. (Photo/Video A24 Films) Obvious Child Gillian Robespierres small strong debut feature which takes its title from the Paul Simon song is set mostly in Brooklyn and takes its energy from the startlingly funny and poignant performance of its star Jenny Slate. She plays Donna Stern a whipsmart Jewish 20-something with an eggshell ego who is struggling to make a career for herself as a stand-up comic. In the jaundiced view of her mother (Polly Draper) a college professor who still remembers Donnas College Board scores shes already a failure ""You waste that 780 verbal on telling jokes about having diarrhea in your pants."" Maybe so though not the whole story. (Richard Kind plays Donnas puppeteer father who adores her.) This desperate heroine is a hard case and terribly tender at the same time. She spews her jokes about bodily functions to establish a trashy intimacy but equally to keep her audiences and her friends at bay. ""Obvious Child"" is most obviously about what happens when a man who is good and kind--and a WASP from Vermont--enters her life and in a single drunken night gets her pregnant. (Hes played by Jake Lacy.) Just as obviously its concerned with Donnas decision about an abortion a subject seldom dealt with in run-of-the-mine rom-coms. Yet the heart of the film lies in what it manages to say without boldface or italics about how hard it is for Donna like so many of her anxious cohort to make genuine connections to break free of narcissistic constraints and become a stand-up grown-up. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE The Descendants (2011) When I reviewed this superb film I called Shailene Woodleys performance ""phenomenal""; shes Alexandra the older daughter of George Clooneys Matt. I also said a case could be made for her character rather than his as the storys protagonist the driving force who points her confused father in the right direction when family secrets are revealed. Be that as it may Ms. Woodley was a revelation in her first major screen role. Alexander Payne directed from an adaptation by himself Nat Faxon and Jim Rash of a novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings. ENLARGE Mission Impossible--Ghost Protocol (2011) Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt in the fourth installment of the near-venerable series which is lifted by its IMAX action sequences from impressive action to spectacular abstraction. The best stuff transpires in Dubai where Ethan scales the worlds tallest building the Burj Khalifa with the IMAX camera recording his human-fly escapade in wondrously dense yet expansive detail. The director was Brad Bird the animation genius making his debut in live-action features. ENLARGE 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days (2007) Cristian Mungius elegantly crafted brilliantly acted film isnt about abortion in an incidental way like ""Obvious Child."" Its about abortion in a direct and harrowing way. The setting is late 1980s Bucharest near the end of the despicable Ceausescu regime when abortion is a crime that carries prison terms for all concerned. The underground abortionist played by an extraordinary actor named Vlad Ivanov is a predator who destroys not just one life but in a chilling sense two. --J.M.

"Review The Fault in Our Stars elevates sad story by cutting the sap - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Fault in Our Stars elevates sad story by cutting the sap The Fault in Our Stars James Bridges / 20th Century Fox Ansel Elgort left and Shailene Woodley from the movie ""The Fault in Our Stars."" Ansel Elgort left and Shailene Woodley from the movie ""The Fault in Our Stars."" (James Bridges / 20th Century Fox) Fault in Our Stars film sticks closely to books story sensibility Despite the way death and cancer gnaw at ""The Fault in Our Stars"" the new teenage love story starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort is really about living. Or as Tim McGraw put it in the classic country song live like you were dying -- good advice since we all are.Theres plenty of romance too. And for that the timing couldnt be better. Were in the midst of a romantic movie drought -- certainly for the teenage crowd -- and ""Fault"" is about as hearts-and-flowers as it gets. There are stolen kisses longing looks and gauzy montages all set to mood-appropriate alt-rock. Indie ""It boy"" Ed Sheeran is behind the title track. Even though an unhappy ending is a given ""Fault"" is no pity party. Pragmatism was part of the appeal of John Greens bestselling novel on which the film is based. Director Josh Boone and screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber -- the writing pair responsible for the lovely hipster romance ""(500) Days of Summer"" -- stick closely to the story and the sensibility which should please the books fans.Like its cancer kids ""Fault"" has good and bad moments. What sustains the film through the rockier times are its challenging themes offering real issues for the young protagonists to wrestle with rather than whether anyone will be carded trying to buy beer. Woodley and Elgort play the hand theyre dealt well balancing the sentiment with a good deal of teenage moxie. Make no mistake ""Fault"" is a certifiable weepie but it comes by most of its emotions honestly. Boone uses plausible situations to stir up feelings without the heart-tugging calculation that brings so many tear-jerkers down. For our doomed young lovers cancer is just another teenage problem to deal with no excuse for schmaltz. Photos A handful of heart-wrenchers on the silver screen. (By Los Angeles Times Staff) Still 16-year-old Hazel Grace Lancaster (Woodley) is more aware of death than most. She knows her expiration date is coming soon; the lung disease thats shaped her life and now ties her to an oxygen tank is never stable long.The requisite rom-dram ""meet sweet"" happens at a cancer support group for teens. Good-looking with an irresistible smile and healthy skepticism 18-year-old Gus Waters (Elgort) shows up with his best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff). Gus is in remission -- its Isaacs eyes that are under attack. But the disease has taken a bite out of Gus too. The one-time athlete now has a prosthetic leg hes still learning to control. The Fault in Our Stars trailer Watch the trailer for ""The Fault in Our Stars."" Watch the trailer for ""The Fault in Our Stars."" See more videos The spark and the snark that pass between Hazel and Gus are immediate and set the tone. A stare-down between the teens -- Gus amused Hazel defiant -- comes next. They start seriously bonding around the share circle run by slightly older cancer survivor Patrick (Mike Birbiglia) -- the endless string of eye-rolling affirmations Patrick offers up and the pairs spirited confrontation on the subject of oblivion seal the deal. Theyre not so much cynical as realistic.Within the typically angst-filled world of a teenager who happens to also have cancer ""Fault"" is smarter-than-average as it works its way through one issue after another first love first sex rebellion identity the disease etc. It helps that much of ""Fault"" turns on Hazels obsession with a novel about death. Literary underpinnings even fictitious ones tend to elevate the debate.""An Imperial Affliction"" the only book written by a reclusive author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) ends frustratingly mid-sentence. Hazel has written countless letters trying to get the author to tell her how things work out for the surviving characters. A nice way of letting us know Hazel has accepted her own fate but worries what her death will mean for those left behind.Being the perfect boyfriend Gus tracks down Van Houten to try to get Hazel Grace as he calls her the answers. That becomes ""The Faults"" engine one that sends the teens on one of those ""last wish"" journeys to Amsterdam to Van Houtens door and through a series of mettle-testing highs and lows.Paying attention to what happens in the margins keeps ""Fault"" from falling completely in the mush pit. Like an ordinary kid Hazel worries when Gus doesnt text or call after their first date. Gus insists on driving even though his leg makes it a hazardous affair. They rebel against convention type-casting and their parents though with a kind of tenderness that comes in understanding the burden of their illness. And they relate -- to the world their condition and each other -- in believable ways. The dialogue is clever without being pretentious.This is Boones second film. His first ""Stuck in Love"" starred Greg Kinnear as a writer trying to reassemble his fractured family; it made a brief appearance last year before going to DVD. Though the film didnt always work what it did exhibit was Boones light touch with human failings. You can sense an empathy for the capriciousness of life in his work. It softens harsh edges it brings out a purity of emotions in his actors. ""Fault"" is better for it.Laura Dern is particularly affecting as Frannie Hazels mother trying to live with short-term hope One more good day. Then another if theyre lucky. Humor is woven through the cancer jokes and blind jokes pointed but not caustic. Wolff provides much of the comic relief -- Isaac throwing a trophy-smashing tantrum after a breakup is a good start for an even funnier blind bit to come. They laugh so that you can.Elgort is pretty adorable as Gus the actor exhibiting leading guy potential. The chemistry he and Woodley share seems very organic some of it no doubt rooted in time spent together on ""Divergent"" in which he played her brother. Elgort has a very appealing way of making sure Gus confidence stops just short of cocky. But Woodley is the one who binds the film together heals all of its wounds. She gives Hazel the right level of strength and vulnerability resistance and acceptance to create a real girl living in a real world. It allows you to feel Hazels struggle and mourn her fate but save your pity for someone else.----------------------------- The Fault in Our StarsMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic elements some sexuality and brief strong languageRunning time 2 hours 5 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Column Authors Ansel Elgort Shailene Woodley A scene from The Fault in Our Stars Fandango says Fault is its biggest pre-selling romantic drama Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-the-fault-in-our-stars-review-20140606-column.html,200,thefaultinourstars19,thefaultinourstars,latimes

James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort) take on a variety of challenges in The Fault in Our Stars. James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox Josh Boones The Fault in Our Stars is the kind of careful listless adaptation that makes a critic want to rave at length about the wonderful novel on which its based. Not that John Greens 2012 YA novel a runaway best-seller about two cancer-ridden suburban teens in love needs much of an introduction. Millions of parents read over their avid kids shoulders about the brief encounter between teenagers Hazel who has stage 4 thyroid cancer (""with mets to the lungs but Im okay"") and Augustus who lost his leg to bone disease. I cried buckets but its a very funny book. Cancer is no fun at all in the real world and in fiction it can be a big bully squeezing out all other life before making a home run for the inspirational Big Weep. Not here In graceful exceptionally well-spoken prose Green attaches us firmly to two young people who are in no position to do what the rest of us do which is to live our lives as if we werent going to die. So this is a cancer story but its about the irreverent exuberant life that Hazel and Gus get to live together in deaths shadow. What inspires is not some pale-and-romantic capacity for noble suffering but the insistence of two truculent young charmers on their right to live richly in the teeth of oblivion. So they do have film-friendly adventures among them a glitzy trip to Europe to collar a mysterious author whose novel in their opinion needs a better ending or maybe an ending of any kind. Hold that thought for thematic significance; Green isnt all that interested in plot. He has perfect pitch for the knowing direct teenage voice with its dripping sarcasm and gallows humor. The adolescent smart-mouth is hardly a rarity in the YA milieu (see Juno Mean Girls); but you dont hear Hazel and Gus using the word ""like"" as punctuation. They make a glam bantering couple in the way that Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn were or Myrna Loy and William Powell. Gus and Hazel are enchanting old souls as literary and intensely philosophical as youd expect from bright kids in their predicament. In a movie they should be played by odd ducks like Ellen Page or Alia Shawkat and some as-yet-undiscovered descendant of Daniel Day Lewis -- or it occurred to me while watching the film by the fetchingly wry Nat Wolff whos wasted in a sidekick role. The Fault in Our Stars is weakened upfront by miscasting. Shailene Woodley is a fine young actress with a great future and I love it that this dressed-down makeup-free environmentalist has become a hero to teenage girls who also groove to the Miley Cyrus twerk. But here Woodley projects (as she did to far better effect in last years The Spectacular Now) a serene straight arrow most of whose coming-of-age battles are already won. That is not Hazel at least not yet. And Ansel Elgort a self-consciously charming stud who radiates robust health and looks like a sports dude is all wrong for Gus a skinny former jock who hasnt exercised his muscles in a while. Hazel has a nose tube and drags an oxygen tank and Gus is missing a limb so it doesnt help that the two of them look as if they just blew in from the gym. Boones The Fault in Our Stars isnt terrible; its just fatally ordinary in the way that Hollywood realism so often is. Clad in jolly suburban pastels and with a pop soundtrack that wouldnt offend your grandmother (let alone the likable Laura Dern who plays Hazels endlessly supportive mother) this sluggishly paced movie plugs away diligently at reproducing Greens general drift. But its the writing and the limp delivery of dialogue that take the movie seriously downhill. Screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber who wrote the paper-thin (500) Days of Summer pluck out Greens topic sentences (""the world is not a wish-granting factory"") while cleansing the script of the idiosyncratic literary ramblings that give his characters their vitally weird chemistry. In the novel Hazel and Gus are both cowed and enlarged by their circumstances. Insisting on being treated as though they matter as much as everyone else they make us see what a tragedy it is that they dont have more time together and that their actual time together is more raw intense and full-hearted than that of most people who live out the full span. In the movie Gus and Hazel are two nice regular kids with cancer who find inspiration in Anne Frank and true romance. All around me people broke out sobbing at the end. As love stories go though The Fault in Our Stars is more Erich Segal than John Green. I left dry-eyed.

James Bridges Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort) are two extraordinary teenagers who share an acerbic wit a disdain for the conventional and a love that takes them on an unforgettable journey. James Bridges Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort) are two extraordinary teenagers who share an acerbic wit a disdain for the conventional and a love that takes them on an unforgettable journey. If you are older than the tween demographic for ""The Fault in Our Stars"" youve probably seen death up close and you know that its not pretty. Terminally ill people puke and poop and plead for us to put them out of their misery. Yet in this airbrushed movie the worst suffering a cancer patient endures is an oxygen tube in her nostrils.That patient is poor Shailene Woodley as Indianapolis teenager Hazel who has lung problems and presumably a short lease on life. As Woodley proved in ""The Descendents"" she is a promising young actress; but after her wallflower role in ""The Spectacular Now"" and her miscasting as an action heroine in ""Divergent"" spending an entire film with a rubber hose up her nose might not have been a smart career move. Yet Woodleys off-putting appearance is a minor matter compared to the major disaster that is Ansel Elgort. As a cocky cancer patient named Augustus who befriends Hazel in a ridiculous Christian support group this strip-mall James Dean is the worst thing to happen to teen romance since herpes. Maybe it was cute in the source novel by John Green to have the rebellious boyfriend dangle an unlit cigarette from his pouty lips but on the big screen this distracting affectation screams ""mixed message.""In a world where parents dont seem to matter much Augustus persuades a charity to bestow a dubious last wish a trip to Amsterdam to meet the author of her favorite cancer-themed novel. When the author (Willem Dafoe) turns out to be a drunken monster who gives the boot to his unexpected visitors they take refuge in a museum. And not just any museum but the Anne Frank house where their cancer is conflated with the Holocaust. This movie is so tone-deaf it would only make sense in Vincent van Goghs missing ear. By itself the scene where the lovebirds blind friend Isaac (Nat Wolff rekindling memories of Ralphie in ""A Christmas Story"") throws eggs at the car of the girl who spurned him is worthy of a Golden Turkey Award.

"Fault in Our Stars The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fault-in-our-stars-the ) Fault in Our Stars The (United States 2014) June 05 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Calling The Fault in Our Stars a ""teenage cancer romance"" might be understating the films laudable qualities but its also a reasonably accurate three-word summary of the plot. Adapted from John Greens best-selling YA novel of the same name The Fault in Our Stars merits notice not because of its formulaic storyline but because of the heartfelt manner in which it is presented. The acting is top-notch the characters are three-dimensional and the dialogue is sharp and witty. Josh Boones direction is unremarkable but he understands how to get out of the way and let the actors do their thing. In the era of the auteur director its sometimes refreshing to find a filmmaker who recognizes the value of self-effacement. To call a movie in which both leads have cancer and are dancing with the Grim Reaper a ""feel good experience"" isnt as unlikely as it might seem at first. Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort) are in many ways more alive than most due to their constant awareness of the fragility of their existences. The average teenager isnt aware of his or her mortality; Hazel and Ausgustus have no choice but to be intimately acquainted with theirs. They live in the present because they may have no future. The movie captures this sense of immediacy in an effortless unforced manner. Only toward the end when events reach their terminus does Boone overdo the manipulation. The only thing missing at this point is a blinking neon sign demanding ""Cry dammit"" Its obvious The Fault in Our Stars doesnt want a dry eye in the theater. The movie is told from Hazels perspective and although her voiceover narrative isnt a guarantee that shell survive the proceedings it offers a sense of reassurance. Weare introduced to her around the time she first encounters Augustus at a cancer support group meeting. Both of their diseases are in remission but she carries around an oxygen cylinder because her lungs are prone to filling with fluid and she cant breathe without it. Augustus appears completely healthy having apparently beaten his affliction after losing a leg to it. The two bond flirt send each other witty text messages and move forward with a quasi-romance until Hazel decides they should just be friends. She argues that since shes likely to die sooner than later it would only hurt Augustus to become embroiled in a love affair with her. He demurs and continues to pursue her. The screenplay contains more humor than can be found in the average cancer-related film although it falls short of the pinnacle achieved by 50/50 which largely avoided the kind of overt manipulation that emerges late in The Fault in Our Stars. The characters here are beautifully realized. As clichA(c)-riddled as the plot may be Hazel and Augustus stand out as genuine credible individuals and the honesty with which they are brought to the screen trumps many other concerns and obfuscates nitpicky flaws. Shailene Woodley who has blossomed in motion pictures during the past year with star turns in The Spectacular Now and Divergent is in top form here (even if she seems a little too old to play a teenager). Her lover is brought to life by Ansel Elgort (who portrayed her brother in Divergent). Laura Dern is Hazels mother; her role is meatier than is common for parents in teen-centered motion pictures. Willem Dafoe is Hazels favorite author Peter Van Houten whose introduction argues that sometimes heroes and icons are best kept at a distance. The movie adaptation of Greens novel is faithful to the source in large part due to the authors ongoing involvement in the production. Fans of The Fault in Our Stars are unlikely to find fault with how the material has been transitioned from page to screen. The core demographic will likely be thrilled but even those who havent read a page of the book and come to this project with a natural inclination toward cynicism will find things to appreciate about this tragic-yet-uplifting love story.

Entertainment Why ""The Fault In Our Stars"" Is Better On The Page Than On The Screen Hollywood has nothing on the original book when it comes to telling stories that arent just sad for the sake of being sad. The long-awaited movie version of John Greens hit YA novel arrives in theaters this Friday. (Spoilers if you havent read the book.) Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley in The Fault in Our Stars James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox ID 3078327 ""I believe we have a choice in this world about how to tell sad stories"" Hazel says at the beginning of the movie adaptation of The Fault in Our Stars. ""On the one hand you can sugarcoat it. Nothing is too messed up that cant be fixed with a Peter Gabriel song. I like that version as much as the next girl does. Its just not the truth."" Its not a line thats in John Greens wise tragicomic novel which starts off with Hazel describing her cancer-fueled depression. Or not exactly -- later in the book much later Hazel and the love of her life Augustus Waters joke about an upsetting and disappointing meeting they had with one of their idols. He was abrupt and cruel to them in person but in the retelling they make fun of him and Hazel observes ""You have a choice in this world I believe about how to tell sad stories. And we made the funny choice."" Its a small tweak in whats overall a very faithful adaptation of the book -- director Josh Boone (Stuck in Love) and screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber would be insane to make sizable changes to source material thats so beloved. But I feel like its the divide between the novel which I loved and the movie which left me a little cold despite the reliable charms of Shailene Woodley as the terminally ill Hazel and relative newcomer Ansel Elgort as Gus whos in remission when they meet. The first confronts kids-with-cancer tropes while the second despite how it tries to position itself in the beginning gives into them. One feels like a story about two teenagers living with a serious illness and the other like the story of how one of those teenagers dies of one. ID 3077781 View this image > James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox ID 3078345 In the book the line about sad stories is an example of what Hazel and Ansel do all the time which is defy expectations of them as stalwart martyrs to the generally terrible hand in life theyve been dealt. Theyre cynical they crack jokes and they sometimes get frustrated or depressed but theyve decided not to let their lives be the tale of their disease. Its why the novel which indeed tells a sad story feels so tender and funny and enduring rather than just some kind of literary tear stick a calculated mechanism to provoke sobs in the long tradition of ""sick-lit"" novels (many of them written by the genres cursive font-loving grande dame Lurlene McDaniel). Despite Hazels words at the start of the film (and that dig at poor Peter Gabriel) the big screen version of The Fault in Our Stars really isnt the same kind of departure from tradition that the book is. Its got more sass certainly but it also has a melodramas tendency toward manipulation underneath the gestures toward keeping it real. And in that way it does feel like a thoroughbred version of Love Story or A Walk to Remember or one of the other films about how sad it is when someone dies young rather than Greens more fervent earnest take on learning to embrace whatever time you have with all its pain and wonder. The Fault in Our Stars the movie has been duly Hollywoodized despite its own claims to the contrary and in doing so and truncating Hazel and Gus tale into two hours leaves out a lot of the tougher cancer stuff that shapes its characters lives. The machine Hazel has to get strapped into just to breathe at night the girlfriend Gus had before Hazel (who died of a brain tumor that altered her personality) the unpretty late-stage decline of one of the characters thats given much more space in the novel -- all of those are gone. The film also eliminates all the foreshadowing the book gives to its central plot twist leaving it to be a big surprise which doesnt do much justice to its treatment of living with and dying of the disease. ID 3078338 View this image > James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox Film ID 3079325 I dont doubt that there are plenty of fans of the book wholl be thrilled to see Hazel and Gus on screen in whatever form and Woodley and Elgort are very likable leads. But they too are unavoidably prettied up -- instead of Hazels ""puffy steroid face"" you have Woodley going without makeup and shorn of some important later moments Gus comes across as more of a Manic Pixie Dream Guy rather than a complex character unto himself. Yes this is what happens when you make a movie but the sense of loss is more acute here because the more studio sheen these characters are given the more their difficult moments are sanded away the more the focus shifts from being about how two precocious cancer-ridden teenagers live to the fact that theyre going to die. Theres plenty to be said for the emotional catharsis of reaching for the tissues as you watch a lovable character perish for fiction allowing us to visit the realm of tragedy without actually having to stay there. And the movie version of The Fault in Our Stars has been formulated with laser precision to extract tears from the music to the warm glow of Ben Richardson cinematography. But that feels sometimes uncomfortably like its point and as faithful an adaptation as it is in so many ways this fact misses something essential that made the novel such a hit for both young and fully grown adults. Its a familiar refrain to claim a book is better than the movie but in this case its very true -- these characters especially wry clever vulnerable Hazel are just better on the page.

MCT 20th Century Fox The Fault in Our Stars    Director Josh Boone Cast Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort Laura Dern Rated PG-13 (thematic elements sexuality brief strong language) Running time 125 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 422pm on Thursday Jun. 05 2014 Thursday Jun. 05 2014 Thursday Jun. 05 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Last summer The Spectacular Now was the teen-trauma film of note being based on a well-regarded bestseller and starring an up-and-coming Shailene Woodley.This year its The Fault in Our Stars which shares many attributes with its predecessor including having roots in a popular young-adult novel screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber and a much better-known Woodley who moved up to star status with Divergent earlier this year.Like Spectacular it walks that fine line between moving and mawkish without falling too far over to the latter side. Unlike that earlier film though which didnt make a huge splash in the mainstream Fault looks to become the teary alternative to all the boom and bang of the summer superheroes.Woodley plays Hazel the typical outgoing teen-next-door living the middle-class life in suburban Indiana. Except she has cancer and has to bring an oxygen tank wherever she goes. One of those places is a youth support group where she meets newcomer Gus (Ansel Elgort also from Divergent) who has lost a leg to his disease.They strike up a friendship that quickly escalates into something more as they wrestle with issues of fate and mortality. As with The Spectacular Now its refreshing to see teenage relationships handled with grace and depth instead of the usual snark and cynicism. Director Josh Boone ( Stuck in Love) stays out of the way stylistically and lets the considerable naturalistic chemistry between Elgort and Woodley be the draw.Their conversations wavering between youthful bravado and grim determinism feel authentic as does their budding romance. Thats no doubt due in some part to John Greens book on which the film is based.Nat Wolff ( Palo Alto Admission) as mutual friend Isaac a support-group member who is losing his sight because of cancer seems at first an awkward attempt at comic relief but his role deepens as events become more serious.That doesnt mean there arent moments that ring false. Laura Dern as Hazels concerned mom is one-dimensional while Willem Dafoe as Van Houten an author who has inspired Hazel is painted in such cartoonish strokes that he seems more like a convenient plot point than a real person. Also at just over two hours Fault sometimes moves slowly and veers frustratingly close to TV-movie-of-the-week territory. Still that doesnt dim the bright light at the heart of the story. Thats really the only special effect that this film requires. Cary Darling 817 390-7571 Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Be honest - thats what youre thinking. Prejudging is easy when it comes to The Fault in Our Stars the movie version of John Greens 2012 young-adult bestseller about a present-day Romeo and Juliet both starcrossed by the Big C. More News Summer Film Preview 2014 The Season of Fierce 40 Best YA Novels All Stories >> It turns out The Fault in Our Stars isnt total crap on the page or on the screen. Green made the wise choice to be funny in telling his sad story. And the film directed by Josh Boone from a wittily nuanced script by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber of (500) Days of Summer follows suit. Its a fresh lively love story brimming with humor and heartbreak and lifted to the heights by Shailene Woodley 22 a sublime actress with a resume from The Descendants to Divergent that pretty much proves shes incapable of making a false move on camera. Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster a 16-year-old whose thyroid cancer forces her to wear tubes in her nose and drag around an oxygen tank. As a look it sucks. And Hazel knows it. Plus she has a mouth on her. What makes Hazel puke more than chemo is her cancer support group. That is until she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort wonderful) a full-on charmer who is in remission since his osteosarcoma necessitated that one of his legs be removed from the kneedown. Gus is in group to support his buddy Isaac played by Nat Wolff so fine in Palo Alto and equally outstanding here. Isaac has lost one eye to cancer with the other likely to go. Depressing? Youd think. But the actors under Boones astute direction never hit the pedal on self-pity. Hazel tells Gus her literary obsession is An Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe superb) a recluse who ended his novel in midsentence and high-tailed it to Amsterdam. Hazel is consumed with finding Van Houten. So off she goes to Amsterdam with her clumsy breathing apparatus her mother (Laura Dern) and loyal Gus. Hard truths are learned. On a visit to Anne Franks attic Hazel and Gus share a kiss. Hold on. It only sounds awful. Woodley and Elgort siblings in Divergent are way cool as lovers putting a hip hotblooded spin on what could be maudlin mush. They find the tales comic spirit without losing its tragic fervor.

JAMES BRIDGES BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The Fault in Our StarsStarring Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort Directed by Josh Boone Rated PG-13 for thematic elements some sexuality and brief strong language Running time 2 hours 6 minutes Playing In wide releaseThe quick hitThe lead performers elevate this lackluster adaptation of John Greens beloved book about the love between two teenagers who meet at a cancer support group. Grade C+ ""What can you say about a twenty-five-year-old girl who died? That she was beautiful. And brilliant. That she loved Mozart and Bach. And the Beatles. And me."" That quote got millions bawling when they read and saw ""Love Story"" 44 years ago. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" makes the lovers high school age and then doubles down on the illness fast track afflicting both the heroine and hero with cancer. What can you say about a teenage girl with thyroid cancer that has spread to the lungs? That she is beautiful and brilliant? Yes That she loved Mozart and Bach and the Beatles? No but in John Greens book she does love poets T.S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams and in the movie she retains her adoration for an elaborate Dutch cult novel also about a girl with cancer. What can you say about a teenage boy who has lost half a leg to osteosarcoma? That he is handsome and clever? Of course That he loves video games and movies like ""300"" - or in this film ""Aliens"" - instead of classical music and poetry? For sure After all hes a boy. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" about the love that grows between the two leads after they meet at a cancer support group will be a giant hit for one reason. Those who devoured Greens sophisticated touching book can project onto Shailene Woodley who plays Hazel Grace Lancaster and Ansel Elgort who plays Augustus Waters all the emotional shading wit and bits of realism that otherwise dont make it into the movie. Those who havent read the novel just might be able to get lost in the remaining earnest heartache - but I have my doubts. I read half saw the movie then finished the book right after the screening. The novel held me all the way but the film fell to pieces at midpoint and never regained traction. The glory of Greens writing is Hazels voice - droll generous perceptive and grounded. Shes mercifully clear-eyed employing her powers of observation to understand even people who enrage her. Via her oddball spoken duets with the more flamboyant Gus Green succeeds in using a YA cancer novel to dramatize the argument between Hazels realistic view of life and Gus romantic one. Gus is obsessed with leaving a mark on the world like a Spartan warrior or a superhero; Hazel will be content if she is loved ""deeply but not widely."" The movies screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber who did a remarkable job adapting Tim Tharps novel ""The Spectacular Now"" are unable to find a glittering present here. They employ Hazels narration to set up the story and bring it to a close. They even concoct fresh lines in Hazels manner like her blast at storytellers who sugarcoat sad tales so that ""nothing is too messed up that cant be fixed with a Peter Gabriel song."" They fail to inform the fanciful action with Hazels torrent of ideas. Because they cannot capture her precocious perspective episodes that should reverberate with thought and feeling go flat. Her obsession with that Dutch novel ""An Imperial Affliction"" becomes little more than a clunky subplot and a sequence that unfolds at the Anne Frank House is catastrophic. Director Josh Boone is no help. After a deft light-comedy opening he falls short of evoking Hazels or Greens sensibility or style. He still places the story in Indianapolis but the atmosphere has no local flavor. The settings are all-purpose suburban and often cozier than youd expect from the book. Setting the couples text messages on screen in word balloons infects even witty digital dialogue with a terminal case of the cutes (especially when the balloons disappear like twinkling stars). How can Boone include a dig at Peter Gabriel when he engages his own composers Mike Mogis and Nathaniel Walcott (of the indie-rock band Bright Eyes) to pile pseudo-poignant feelings onto his movies touchy-feely montages and travelogues? Amid everything thats forced or ersatz about the movie Woodley and Elgort are the real thing. They match up exquisitely. With her unconventional looks and smoky-toned voice Woodley exudes unvarnished feeling tempered only by a fine intelligence. Elgort is as innately stylish as Woodley is effortlessly natural. His offhand theatricality suits Gus sometimes ironic always idealistic distance from daily life as well as his love for metaphor. (He dangles a cigarette between his lips but doesnt light it to symbolize his refusal to let a ""killing thing"" have ""the power to do its killing."") Elgort is enough of an actor to make you understand what Green meant when he said in an online Qamp;A ""The true heros journey is from strength to weakness. And to my mind that makes Gus very heroic indeed."" Contact the writer msragowocregister.com Most Popular U.S. Open of Surfing Will you marry me?

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Shailene Woodley has that special something that gives a breathtaking truthfulness to her work. Science calls it Shailenium a rare element that powers her performances with disarming sincerity. Woodley plays cancer patient Hazel in ""The Fault in Our Stars"" earning our sympathy by never asking for it. Confident to the point of stubbornness with the adults in her life she rejects her parents overprotective focus on her illness insisting that they treat her as a whole person not a collection of symptoms. Shes still only a teenager however. Shes determined not to dabble in romance for fear of hurting the other person. ""Im a grenade"" she says. ""One day Im going to blow up obliterating everything in my wake."" Still she doesnt have the experience to stop herself falling for the wrong guy. That would be Gus (Ansel Elgort) another cancer kid with a beguiling smile and an easygoing wit. ""All of your efforts to keep me away from you are going to fail"" Gus promises. The film based on the bestseller by John Green leavens its poignant premise with insight and self-deprecating humor. The script by smart-romance specialists Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber who gave us ""500 Days of Summer"" and ""The Spectacular Now"" sees its characters affectionately acknowledging their everyday struggles with the uncertainty the disease brings them. The notion that these two would be smitten and fall in love makes perfect emotional sense. Its a pity-free relationship which is what anyone in the circumstances would want. And they can make light of their illness. Theres a loose silliness to their dialogue that makes them sound like smart acerbic teenagers rather than cutsey jokesters. Woodley and Elgort are sweetly awkward wending their way through a love that brings the potential for terrible repercussions while offering an intimacy that lightens their burdens and offers the possibility of reaching a better place. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" honors all facets of this rich sometimes sad story. Expect to have a lump in your throat the last 20 minutes and to let go of a few tears at the end. Thankfully the film earns that emotional release honestly. Anyone who can watch Woodley and Elgorts romantic tug-of-war and not get caught up in their charm is defective. THE FAULT IN OUR STARS 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic elements sexuality and brief strong language. Its adult characters rarely achieve three dimensions -- Laura Dern is sweetly overbearing as Hazels mother and Willem Dafoe is an abrasive caricature as a novelist whose work Hazel idolizes -- but this isnt their story after all. The film is narrated by Hazel in a voice that is wise but not wise beyond her years. She opens by warning that stories like hers often are told in ways that ""sugarcoat it so nothing is too messed up that cant be cured by a Peter Gabriel song."" Preparing us for what follows she warns that she prefers truth. So does this touching warm-spirited movie even as it finds its own romance-pop moments along the way. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort shine as the cancer teens -- one grave the other gallant -- in the mostly fine movie made from John Greens YA best-seller Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort) dont have absolutely everything in common. For example her favorite book is the death-drenched An Imperial Affliction by the mysterious Peter van Houten. His favorite the novelization of a video game he loves Insurgent 2. Shes deep and depressed hes all blithe bonhomie. But both are cancer teens. Augustus the former basketball prodigy lost a leg to osteosarcoma; Hazel with what started as thyroid cancer and has since spread geometrically lugs around an apparatus the size of a fire extinguisher to pump air into her dilapidated lungs. And if their choice in literature differs they are together as the heroes of John Greens The Fault in Our Stars the YA best-seller that is now a pretty fine movie. (READ Lev Grossman on John Greens The Fault in Our Stars) An adolescent take on the old film weepie Love Story (""What can you say about a twenty-five year old girl who died?"") Greens book managed to be both bitingly sarcastic and unashamedly uplifting. Having lived with cancer for half of her 16 years Hazel has developed an emotional auto-immune system mockery. She greets anyone in authority -- her parents her doctors the guy who runs the group-therapy session at a local church -- with an eyebrow raised in cynical judgment. She has fully earned the attitude held by many teens that theyre on a desperate adventure adults simply cant understand. That adage is true for Hazel who is likely to die before she can legally buy a beer. Her doctor has advised doubling her meds but the true antidote is a strong dose of luh-uv. And Augustus is the sweetest Dr. Feelgood. His seeming ease with his prosthesis and with what doctors tell him is an 85% chance of beating the disease complements her dour belief ""Depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying."" His Candide and her Cassandra are the perfect match. And what is drama -- all drama really -- but the story of beautiful people with horrible problems? (SEE A clip from The Fault in Our Stars) Hazels and Augustuss mutually ticking Doomsday clocks compel them to pack the luster of a lifetime -- a first love a trip to Europe a meeting with Hazels favorite author a last love -- into what may be their only summer. Skeptical Hazel comes alive at the innocent touch of Augustus whose charm is as urgent as it is benign. Hes like a pop record that has just three minutes to raise your spirits or break your heart. For Hazel Augustus does both. They may weave the same magic on moviegoers so smartly does the film enfold this loving couple in the cocoon of evanescent intimacy. In the screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber -- whose scripts for (50o) Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now also apotheosized the angst and ecstasy of young love -- Hazel and Augustus are all either of them needs. The movie gives them exactly one friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) for misanthropic commit relief and cannily excludes Hazels parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) from the best parts of her luscious endangered world. Though they have become expert at fretful optimism and pre-grieving the parents can be chaperones but not confidants. And they must be denied access to their daughters tree house of love. (READ Corlisss review of (500) Days of Summer) Movies about adolescence as a secret garden where only misfits fit bloomed in the 1960s beginning with David and Lisa Keir Dullea as the boy who wont let people touch him and Janet Margolin as the girl with dissociative identity disorder. Otto Premingers Tell Me That You Love Me Junie Moon turned the duo into a trio a literally and emotionally scarred young woman Liza Minnelli) an epileptic (Robert Moore) and a gay paraplegic (Ken Howard). Love Story in 1970 streamlined these mental and physical disabilities into the plot wallop of leukemia which befalls poor girl Ali MacGraw as her rich young husband Ryan ONeal sobs and endures. All these decades later The Fault in Our Stars sets the most toxic misery among the most adorable company. Fault has a few. A meeting in New Amsterdam with Hazels favorite author (Willem Dafoe) seems a bilious detour with an improbable payoff. The trip also affords the filmmakers an egregious scene in the Anne Frank House where a Jewish girls descent into the Holocaust is straight-facedly compared to a teens cancer. No we have to say; theyre different. To paraphrase Hazels maxim on infinities some atrocities are bigger than other atrocities. (READ Roger Rosenblatt on Anne Frank one of TIMEs 100 People of the 20th Century) Yet Hazel and Augustus will live in film lore because of the young actors who play them. Woodley who graduated from supporting roles (George Clooneys rebellious daughter in The Descendants) and indie leads (the bo0kworm in The Spectacular Now) to her own YA movie franchise (Divergent) has the gift of acting internally she makes you watch her watch something lets you read the mind of her character like a good book. Often photographed in dermatological closeup Woodleys face is its own engrossing movie -- an autumnal symphony of darker and lighter browns. She makes Hazel the ideal narrator and receptive audience to Augustus agreeable showmanship. Elgort who can also be seen as Woodleys brother in the Divergent films has a natural screen appeal and suave chemistry with Woodley. He could almost make smitten girls in the audience think it would be worth getting cancer to meet such a paragon. And though you know that Fault like Love Story is bound to have a body count the symbiosis of these stars is so strong youll wish there could be a sequel.

Photo James Bridges Twentieth Century Fox Fault in Our Stars review Beauty and manipulation 1 / 6 Back to Gallery The Fault in Our Stars Drama. Starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort. Directed by Josh Boone. (PG-13. 125 minutes.) Its hard to be definitive about ""The Fault in Our Stars."" Its exploitative in the most obvious ways and yet sincere. Its a product of sophisticated market calculation and yet artless in its immediacy. Its nothing youd ever want to put yourself through twice and yet its effective in the moment. Shrewdly prefabricated and yet lovingly assembled it is in short the most beautifully made cynical thing Ive ever seen. So what do you say about a movie like that? If films were like mathematics youd take an average of ""almost great"" and ""almost awful"" and end up with ""fair"" or ""just OK."" But ""The Fault in Our Stars"" based on John Greens novel is the furthest thing from fair or OK. It really is almost great and almost awful interchangeably sometimes simultaneously. Manipulative in the worst way its also manipulative in the best way so that in order to be unmoved by it you would have to try actively to be a jerk. Go in with anything short of willful disengagement and you will be swept up - at times. A love story about two teenagers with cancer the title comes from Shakespeares ""Julius Caesar"" but the action is more like ""Romeo and Juliet"" - a tale of first love in all its passions only with cancer replacing the Capulet-Montague conflict. Shailene Woodley is Hazel whose thyroid cancer has become lung cancer. Shes 17 and goes around rolling an oxygen tank behind her but at the moment her condition is stable. More in Movies We Are the Best review touching tale of teen punk rockers Test review Drama dance mix in time of AIDS crisis Night Moves review Ecoterrorism from an odd angle Following familiar pattern At a cancer support group she meets Augustus (Ansel Elgort) who is at least as handsome as the two guys in ""Twilight"" and also acerbic and unshakably confident despite having lost a leg to the disease. In remission hes at the meeting in support of a friend but as soon as he sees Hazel hes in love. Following the familiar pattern of stories directed at girls he thinks Hazel is beautiful knows how amazingly awesome she is but makes no physical demands. He is willing to wait around and be charming. If the above sounds formulaic and calculated other elements dont. At one point early in the story Hazel is presented with an opportunity to fulfill a life dream to travel to Amsterdam and meet her favorite author. But its touch and go whether her health will allow for such a trip. The emotion attached to this is enormous and not just for the characters. It feels like an oppressive cruelty that this should even be a question - that a 17-year-old kid might not survive a plane ride - and if you see ""The Fault in Our Stars"" you will want that girl to have that experience more than you can possibly imagine. Such is the pattern throughout - scenes of calculated banter with phony interactions that feel straight out of some routine product followed by moments of universal truth and aching power. The story can be outguessed within five minutes at least in its broad outlines and yet its many details are often surprising and illuminating. The plotline involving Hazels dealing with her favorite author (Willem Dafoe) is particularly strong in the way it highlights her growth. 2 moving performances Woodley starts slow in what seems like a largely reactive role but as the movie wears on her performance deepens. At times she has a quality of looking like both a young girl and an old lady as if she has crammed a lifetimes worth of maturity into just a few years. In a key scene she has a speech in which she tells Augustus everything he means to her which she does with such simplicity and a fullness of feeling that its wondrous. Theres no minimizing that Its a beautiful moment. She is well matched by Elgort who is no mere abstraction of a teenage girls dream but brings to Augustus a tangle of interesting and conflicting qualities. He is cocky and egotistical but genuinely warm; clearly a kid going places and yet vulnerable in surprising ways. If Woodley shows us the adult within the teenager Elgorts journey is to show us the kid within the adult facade. The quality of the acting and the rightness of Woodley and Elgort as a couple are major weights to put into the balance. And when you add in the movies unwillingness to sugarcoat the awfulness of what its protagonists are facing ""The Fault in Our Stars"" has to be considered some kind of good movie. And so Ive given it some kind of good review. Still I wonder - why do I feel as Ive just been rolled? Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Theyre on a path toward dying way too young even if they walk that path with uncommon pluck. Similarly its hard for viewers to approach the movie in a detached way. How can anyone but the coldest observer lash out against hope in the face of death? How dare you?Fault based on John Greens hugely popular young-adult novel takes a simple approach toward quashing such moral quandaries. Its called quality. The movie is witty and alive and only very occasionally maudlin. It rides a noncondescending style that I assume helped make the book a hit with teens and their parents. (I havent read it though Ive read much about it.)Most important it boasts a monster performance from Shailene Woodley as the storys heroine Hazel Grace Lancaster. Woodley arrived fully formed three years ago in Alexander Paynes Descendents. Shes 22 now but she has no trouble capturing the demeanor of a world-weary teen forced to be wise and a little cynical beyond her years by the knowledge that she could die tomorrow. With her slight rasp and a mercurial face Woodley is the emotional core of a movie that should send Kleenex stock through the roof.Hazel meets the affable Augustus (Ansel Elgort) at a cancer support group and swoons when he lists his biggest fear as ""oblivion."" Soon theyre bonding over a work of literary fiction (subject cancer) and slowly believably falling in love. Their courtship easy and charming but rarely glib speaks for a story that recognizes cancers gravity while insisting adamantly that life must go on -- until it cant. Fault reminds us to seize the day without standing up on a desk and shouting out the words.The Fault in Our Stars like 2011s 50/50 finds necessary humor in the gravest of subjects the inherent glory and ridiculousness of lifes impermanence. It gets serious as it must and some of the familiar tropes of doomed young love start popping up here and there. The final act is my least favorite. But the whole thing maintains a structural and tonal integrity held together by Woodleys tone-perfect voiceover narration.Then theres this Teenagers are reading this book and telling their friends to do the same and it doesnt take place in a dystopian future or rely on readily marketable fantasy. Theres even a novel embedded in the movie (and a misanthropic novelist played to the hilt by Willem Dafoe). As I sat waiting for a recent screening a teenage girl asked me very politely what book I had buried my nose in. (The Insurgents by Fred Kaplan.) She wanted to know what it was about. These things dont happen at promotional screenings unless the movie has inspired or dovetailed with interest in the written word.So yeah Im a little biased when it comes to movies that spread the gospel of reading -- especially when the story is well-told. THE FAULT IN OUR STARS (B+)Directed by Josh Boone. Rated PG-13 (thematic elements some sexuality and brief strong language). 125 mins. In wide release.

For showtimes trailers and reviews click the bold text in each item. (Opening dates may change.) The Fault in Our Stars (June 6) Dont forget the tissues. The movie based on a bestselling young adult novel by John Green follows a teenager stricken with cancer (Shailene Woodley) who falls for a free-spirited boy (Ansel Elgort) set on teaching her how to live while she still can. James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday June 5 2014 Follow AnnHornaday From ""Romeo and Juliet"" to ""Love Story"" doomed love is one of the great themes of literature and cinema its heady brew of sex death commitment and mortality a time-honored way for teenagers and young adults to process their evolving sense of how those forces will play out in their own lives. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is a terrific addition to that canon -- a wise warm funny and touching romantic drama about two teenage cancer patients who bond over a shared illness and tough-but-sensitive world views. Sixteen-year-old Hazel (Shailene Woodley) is in stage 4 of her cancer which has reached her lungs forcing her to lug an oxygen tank everywhere she goes. Gus (Ansel Elgort) 18 has had his leg amputated but is now cancer free. ""Im a roller coaster that only goes up my friend"" he tells the leader of the support group where they meet. That scene -- during which Gus fixes a sustained unabashedly fascinated stare on Hazel as she uncomfortably averts her gaze -- immediately establishes Gus as a charismatic supremely confident force to be reckoned with. As ""The Fault in Our Stars"" unfolds their budding romance reveals inescapable differences between them. Hes an inveterate optimist believing that life and death have a point and that his purpose on Earth is to leave a bright and burning legacy. Hazels more skeptical if not cynical Shes far less convinced of things like higher meanings. But as time goes on its clear that her doubt masks an overwhelming concern for those shell leave behind especially her parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell). ""Im a grenade"" she says at one point. ""One day Im going to explode and I feel its my responsibility to minimize the casualties."" Such forthright unsentimental dialogue is balanced throughout ""The Fault in Our Stars"" by an irreverent almost giddy sense of lightness Hazel and Gus crack wise over ""cancer perks"" and Make-A-Wish-type charities casting mutually knowing glances to each other when Hazel visits Gus and finds his parents framed ""encouragements"" throughout the house. Adapted from John Greens bestselling novel by screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (""(500) Days of Summer"" and ""The Spectacular Now"") ""The Fault in Our Stars"" brims with the kind of adolescent goofiness searching and spiky anger that marked the John Hughes and Cameron Crowe films of another era. But as Hazel informs the audience at the films outset this story wont be neatly ended ""with an apology and a Peter Gabriel song."" In fact and unsurprisingly the story ends sadly but also with a soaring sense of emotional fulfillment. At one point the young couple -- chaperoned by Hazels eternally bright-eyed mom -- visit Amsterdam to conduct a literary treasure hunt revolving around a novel theyre obsessed with. Against that gorgeous backdrop they get to enjoy the sensual pleasures of budding affection made all the more vivid by its somber undertones. A visit to Anne Franks house at first seems to strike an unnecessarily maudlin and strident tone but director Josh Boone builds it into something powerful and profound as Hazel breathlessly climbs the tiny staircases to Franks cramped quarters. At that moment ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is less about young love than about the heroic moral search for meaning in suffering. To its credit ""The Fault in Our Stars"" never loses sight of the couple at its center allowing it to transcend its nominal subject (cancer) and become just a great teenage love story. By now Woodley has proven her bona fides in such similarly serious-minded films as ""The Descendants"" and ""The Spectacular Now."" The revelation here is Elgort -- last seen playing Woodleys brother in ""Divergent"" -- who brings real subtlety and ease to a character whose vulnerability can always be felt peeking through the studied bravado. (He is essentially playing a guy playing another guy -- in this case Gus playing the brave quirky cancer-kid.) Theyre an enormously appealing couple whether theyre joking fighting flirting or seeing each other through their most dire moments of distress. Although ""The Fault in Our Stars"" takes a few genuinely startling turns -- including a breathtakingly cruel encounter with a grouchy supporting character played by Willem Dafoe -- the film doesnt veer too widely from the parameters of tragic melodrama a formula that Boone handles with sensitivity and restrained good taste. Whats more it offers its core young audience the bracing even exhilarating suggestion that love isnt just about finding someone worth dying for but someone who makes life worth living. For that alone ""The Fault in Our Stars"" achieves that rare feat of eliciting as many cheers as tears.    PG-13. At area theaters. Contains thematic elements some sexuality and brief profanity. 125 minutes Related ""The Fault in Our Stars"" by the numbers Just how huge is this movie going to be? Author John Green spends his days focused on devastating topics. He wouldnt trade it for anything. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

""The Fault in Our Stars"" was a popular and widely praised YA book about two teens who meet at a support group for kids with cancer. A five-Kleenex novel -- particularly for innocents too young to know ""Love Story"" -- it took readers on a satisfyingly teary journey. The movie mostly does too but what may have worked in a novel is a little more awkward in a film. Take a major moment when the ailing Hazel vanquishes her pessimism and decides to commit to her love for Augustus. She is in Amsterdam and out of breath after climbing many many stairs to the attic in the Anne Frank house. Suddenly she turns and kisses him. He kisses back. They kiss for quite awhile in fact. After the strangers around them warmly applaud. Augustus mockingly bows. And on the page with your imagination at work this plays as dramatically romantic. But on a screen made real all I could think was OK are these teens really making out in Anne Franks attic? Are they that cluelessly self-absorbed? Even the most generous answer -- that the scene means to metaphorically conflate cancer and the Holocaust to talk about survivors and victims -- is still queasy at best. And what might have only seemed odd when read silently becomes offensive seen upclose. Of course there are other things that a movie can do. It can make text messages come alive and pop up in the middle of a scene (although thats already in danger of becoming a new cinematic cliche). It can actually take us to Amsterdam or make us flash back to the grim horrors of pediatric cancer wards. And it can give space to fine performers like Shailene Woodley the quirky unglamorous Everygirl whose plain strength (and accessible emotions) have made her a young actress to watch. Or Ansel Elgort (one of her ""Divergent"" co-stars) who has less to do but is still properly dreamy as Augustus the boy she cant believe falls for her. They are both fine and bolstered by pros including the wonderful Laura Dern as Graces Mom (even if the script cant think of giving her anything to do but run into rooms in a panic or smile indulgently) and Willem Dafoe as Graces favorite if clayfooted author. For huge fans of the book its a treat to see all these characters come to bigscreen life. But for other audiences the movie adaptation just makes the books small flaws loom larger. Screenwriters Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter (who wrote the excellent and singular ""(500) Days of Summer"" and ""The Spectacular Now"") cant conceal the storys predictable plotting. And spoken aloud Augustus self-consciously orotund dialogue feels not only odd but absolutely out-of-character for this video-gaming ex-jock. The movie is competently directed by Josh Boone who did the similarly not-awful ""Stuck in Love"" (and remains just as wedded to wall-to-wall pop songs). It is well acted (even if none of the adult characters convince) and prettily photographed. Youll probably like it if youve read the book. But if you havent -- well read the book. Because there are some things that look better on the page than on the screen. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations alcohol abuse and strong language.

Sixteen-year-old Hazel (Shailene Woodley) projects her own mortality onto the world Humans will perish she says and no one will remember Mozart let alone someone like her--so whats the point? Enter handsome high-school ex-basketball star Augustus (Ansel Elgort) who lost part of one leg but is now in remission. He falls for Hazel on sight and--in his witty winsome way--fights against her nihilism. Oblivion is unacceptable he says. There must be a point. Although Hazel and Augustus speculate about God and heaven its no surprise where that point is finally found in the infinity that is their love. I know people who wept watching the trailer which features the first and last lines and gives away nearly everything else. (And they say critics spoil movies.) Theyll probably sob at the film too--although for pure concentrated pathos its hard to beat that trailer. There were times I felt a tingling in my tear ducts and almost let loose. But something rubbed me wrong about the opening voice-over in which Hazel warns that the story shes about to tell wont be like one of those movies where everything gets solved with ""a Peter Gabriel song."" (Dear Hazel Eat me. Sincerely Lloyd Dobler.) Whats being peddled as the raw truth is pretty slick. As directed by Josh Boone written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber of (500) Days of Summer and packed with soon-to-be hits by Ed Sheeran and others The Fault in Our Stars is engineered to wriggle around your defenses. Hazel and Augustus trade quips (""I love it when you talk medical to me"") and do all sorts of goofy things but just when youre lulled into believing youre watching a romantic comedy you get slapped into silence by the return of the Big C. The film does however have the best weapon in the world against the perception of slickness an actress without a smidgen of actressiness. Woodley has a face that can look plain in repose and startlingly beautiful in motion when her delicate pink skin becomes near translucent. I know its the way of all saps to believe that actors are as warm and true in life as they are onscreen but if I ever heard that Woodley were an insufferable diva Im not sure I could handle it. Emma Roberts sure. But not Shailene. Related Stories Shailene Woodley and Brie Larson Are Out to Conquer Hollywoodaand Fix It Elgort isnt so convincing though few other actors could pull off a part this phony--and dont say ""But I love Augustus"" because I do too much as I love Casper the Friendly Ghost. When Hazel says shell break his heart he replies ""It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you."" When she says shes a ""grenade"" that could explode at any time he replies ""It would be an honor to have your innards dribbling down my face."" (Not really but he could have.) He uses her middle name--Hazel Grace--to remind her (and us) shes an angel. Even his creepiness is meant to be endearing. The way he stares and stares at her Its not stalkerish its cutting adorably to the chase. He often has a cigarette in his mouth not to smoke but to symbolize his defiance of death. (The constant association between tobacco and the grave is laudable although to my taste Augustus still looks too glamorous waving that cancer stick around.) Its probably a testament to Woodley that I ended up setting aside my doubts like a loving parent ""I dont buy him but if he makes her happy ..."" To elevate the story to the level of myth Green sends the couple on a quest to meet the reclusive author of a book Hazel loves about a girl with cancer--a novel that cuts off annoyingly at the moment of death much like the finale of The Sopranos. Hazel needs to know what happens to the other characters--an obvious extension of her need to know what will happen to her parents and friends in a world without her in it. The subplot is tolerably meta on the page but too literary onscreen although it does give Willem Dafoe a fun scene as the clammy Dutch boozehound with a beard crawling up his face like a fungus. And its a welcome change of scenery transporting our heroes to the romantic paradise that is Amsterdam and that most aphrodisiacal of sites the Anne Frank House where Hazel is finally compelled to surrender to her passion. Their clinch is a mite tacky but at least its not Dachau. The intriguing Nat Wolff (late of the Naked Brothers Band) supplies some bite as Augustuss friend Isaac who loses both his second eye and his girlfriend at roughly the same moment. (The message Not all ""love"" is for always.) And Laura Dern is a perfect match for Woodley as Hazels emotionally overflowing mother her squiggly mouth even wider than usual. Whatever its faults (theyre not in its stars) the movie evokes the heightened intensity of life in the shadow of death--the drive to create meaning where none (probably) exists. The Fault in Our Stars. Directed by Josh Boone Fox PG-13. This article appears in the June 2 2014 issue of New York Magazine.

"The Fault in Our Stars review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Review The Fault in Our Stars Story of two teens in love and battling cancer assaults the tear ducts but lead actress makes the most of her emotionsJune 05 2014|Michael PhillipsAnsel Elgort and Shailene Woodley star in ""The Fault in Our Stars."" (James Bridges 20th Century Fox/MCT)In the discreetly assaultive film version of ""The Fault in Our Stars"" theres a scene faithful to the one in the best-selling John Green book where Hazel and Augustus visit the Amsterdam home of a novelist whose cancer-related novel holds great personal meaning for two teenage Indianapolis cancer patients in love.The meeting is a bust. Their literary idol turns out to be a cynical drunken lout. The kids decide to shake it off and tour the nearby Anne Frank museum. Gamely lugging her oxygen tank up a series of narrow stairways stage 4 lung cancer survivor Hazel makes it to the attic with the aid of Gus who has a partially prosthetic leg owing to bone cancer. There surrounded by fellow tourists and visitors the museum exhibits audio recordings of Franks diary fill the air underscoring to Hazel and Gus the importance of cherishing every moment. They kiss -- its their first biggie -- and the onlookers break into applause.If that scene works for you and on you then by your lights ""The Fault in Our Stars"" will qualify as a successful film adaptation.Contrarily if you find yourself resisting the premise and intention of that scene and its D-Day assault on your tear ducts well Shailene Woodley nearly makes up for it.""The go-to girl for drab roles with grit"" Thats what Village Voice critic Amy Nicholson dubbed Woodley around the time of ""Divergent."" While brave sharp-witted Hazel is certainly a large role drawn from a book adored by millions only a fine actress could make her seem like a three-dimensional person as opposed to a young adult fiction narrator.At the urging of her folks (played by Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) Hazel attends a cancer support group at the local Episcopal church. There she meets Gus portrayed by Ansel Elgort who seems a little stalker-y but hes a babe and a courtly sort of fellow who speaks like someone out of a 19th-century novel.""The Fault in Our Stars"" pushes every button. Gus best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) is going blind and nursing the heartache of a recent breakup. Hazel is wary of opening her heart to Gus but hes ready to rip and theyre simpatico in the extreme. On their dream trip to Amsterdam arranged in defiance of Hazels doctors recommendations they share a tender first-time sexual encounter backed by tons of sensitive ballads on the soundtrack. This is the audience reward for the suffering to come doled out in a series of tasteful leisurely goodbyes that take up the final third of the picture.The director of the film is Josh Boone (""Stuck in Love"") working from a script by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. Their screenplay ""(500) Days of Summer"" was pretty sharp in its depiction of a relationship built on a foundation that isnt really there. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" works differently; the love is rock-solid unassailable and grand. At this stage Woodleys direct open emotionally plangent acting is a full step or two above that of co-star Elgort. Boones technique not helped by the editing is prone to clunky reaction shots of young people in love and smiling at each other. Theres not a lot of easy ebb-and-flow on screen here; points are made obstacles are met or not and theres too much dead air around the dialogue exchanges.Woodley is an ace at handling laughter through tears -- ""my favorite emotion"" as a character in ""Steel Magnolias"" once said. She improves with each new film even when the films themselves arent much.mjphillipstribune.com""The Fault in Our Stars"" - 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for thematic elements some sexuality and brief strong language)Running time 206Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesAnsel Elgort To Reteam with AC/??DivergentAC/??

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Fault In Our Stars is a snappy and resonant teenage weepie blessed with sparks of wit and buoyed by the talents of a charismatic cast. But for fans of its celebrated source material will that be enough? John Greens young-adult bestseller about the tentative but rapturous romance that develops between a pair of wise-beyond-their-years cancer patients has won devotees of all ages in the two years its been flying off shelves. The book contains insights--into living with the approach of death into the inner workings of a sharp adolescent mind--that arent so easily extracted from its eloquent prose. Narrative nuances are trimmed their loss a necessary evil of the translation process while pop songs strain for the feeling Green summoned with words alone. Such are the pitfalls of adaptation Too often something distinctive becomes something common during the move from page to screen.But Faults glow has only been dimmed not extinguished. The movies writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber are no strangers to the field of brainy YA having earned their credentials converting Tim Tharps The Spectacular Now into a comparatively endearing film. Just as she did there Shailene Woodley capably handles heroine duty but shes stepped into a much richer role. The starlet plays Hazel Grace a terminally sick teen who has temporarily staved off the cancer thats ruined her lungs. She lives on borrowed time dragging an oxygen tank behind her always and attempting to minimize the emotional despair of her parents (Sam Trammell and Laura Dern). At one of her weekly torturous support-group meetings Hazel locks eyes with Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort) a studly cocksure survivor now in remission having lost his leg--but not his sense of humor--to the disease. The attraction is instant and mutual but Hazel resists mostly out of fear that shell emotionally destroy her strapping suitor when the cancer comes back to claim her.Deviating only occasionally from Greens text Fault handles its grim realities with both honesty and humor offering a moving romance between two young people forced to confront their mortality at an unfairly early age. Augustus remains more dream than human the most articulate and gentlemanly teenage boy that never existed. But Elgort breathes authenticity into the character and the film justifies its existence by putting Greens whip-sharp banter into the mouths of actors; his stylized dialogue actually sounds more natural more believably adolescent when spoken aloud. Less successful is the attempt to transform the novels first-person narration into snippets of voiceover replacing the constant window into Hazels thought process with a few easy nuggets of quotable wisdom. And the film pays only lip-service to Greens metatextual subplot involving a book within a book its reclusive author (Willem Dafoe excellent in a motivationally tricky role) and the fate of its fictional characters. That element to be honest would have been difficult to translate. The Fault In Our Stars eventually moves into full-blown tearjerker territory though not in the precise way the uninitiated may guess. Its here that Woodley seems to transform in the films grand emotional crucible into a first-rate actress. If shes destined to spend the next few years of her career headlining YA adaptations--and given the existence of Divergent that seems likely--heres hoping that the parts are all as good as Hazel Grace. The movie on a whole achieves a four-hankie catharsis without ever approaching the wounding beauty of Greens instant teen-lit classic. But good movies are made out of great books all the time and to fault Fault for not living up to its inspiration isnt much more fair than dismissing the novel on the grounds that it sounds superficially like Love Story for millennials. As with infinities some successes are just bigger than others.

(James Bridges) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday June 5 2014 400 AM Title The Fault in Our Stars Film Info With Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort. Two teens with cancer fall in love. Director Josh Boone (206). PG-13 Mortality and disease discussion. Area theaters. In John Greens young adult best-seller ""The Fault in Our Stars"" a pair of sharp-witted physically scarred teens face heavy emotions with serenity courage and wisdom. The same is true of the lovingly rendered movie version in which Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort embody teenagers Hazel and Gus as beautifully as fans could hope for. Greens 2012 book dealt fearlessly with mortality; there was none of the standard YA supernatural elements and certainly no pandering. The crisp tearjerker movie directed by Josh Boone turns Greens main characters -- Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus (Gus) Waters -- into flesh-and-blood vessels for every young persons fear of a world out of their control and everyones dream of that One Big Love. When Hazel first meets Gus however shes only sure of one Big Thing -- specifically cancer. Diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 13 shes now 16 wearing a nose tube 24 hours a day and carting around an oxygen tank because her weakened lungs hosted she says ""a cancer colony."" Though shes on solid ground when we meet her her mom and dad (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) suggest she go to a young cancer-survivors meeting at a local church where she meets Gus. Hes a little older than she is but now has no evidence of the bone cancer that claimed his right leg. Outgoing and overconfident unashamed of his prosthetic limb hes the opposite of Hazel. Naturally they zero in on each other. The layered tuned-in adaptation by Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter avoids calculated sentiment. Their mutual friend Isaac (a great Nat Wolff) about to lose his eyesight to a rare cancer is the link between them but soon Hazel and Gus -- both virgins they confide to each other -- are stumbling fast through drug-treatment slang barreling into a serious mutual crush and smashing into soul-mate territory. Gus encourages Hazel to loosen up; she gets him to turn off his beloved videogames and read her favorite book. A trip to Amsterdam to meet that books reclusive ill-tempered author (Willem Dafoe embodying corrosive adulthood) is followed by a hauntingly desperate kiss in of all places the Anne Frank House. Its a spontaneous clutch for dear life because seconds earlier a revelation was bared. Hazel and Gus can dodge the truth no longer. Director Boone cant dodge the truth of the story and anyway the books devotees would freak out if he did. Luckily the layered tuned-in adaptation by Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter avoids calculated sentiment. Yes newcomers to the story will see certain things coming and Hazel and Gus refusal to let cancer define them feels like a conceit. But it also comes off courageous. Much of that is in Greens book but Woodley who lit up ""The Spectacular Now"" and fought for her life in ""Divergent"" grounds her Hazel in truth and dignity and gives her a sly inner life. Elgort who co-starred in ""Divergent"" is also winning in an equally tricky part. Recalling a young Jeff Bridges he uses his grin and brashness as a shield. He and Woodley have a zing that a movie with such serious undertones needs. Those looking for any fault in these stars -- or the proud full-of-life characters they portray -- will have to look elsewhere.

It works. If you dont cry or snort or at least tear up a little at some point during Josh Boones film version of the popular young-adult novel by John Green youre a pretty cold fish.JUNE MOVIE GUIDE Avoid the heat and take a seat in theatersIts not because the writing is subtle or the direction nuanced though. Its because Shailene Woodley is so good as the dying girl who hadnt planned on falling in love. She makes something more something better out of a movie that would have appealed mostly to teenage girls arriving with tissue in hand.INTERVIEW Shailene Woodley among the StarsWoodley plays Hazel Lancaster 16 who has tumors in her lungs and has to lug around a portable oxygen tank. Her mother Frannie (Laura Dern very good) insists that she try a support group which is led by a guy with a guitar who made his own rug with a portrait of Christ so that he can say theyre meeting in the literal heart of Jesus. (Mike Birbiglia is funny in the role a small performance that strikes a nice balance between cynicism and genuine belief.)There she meets Gus (Ansel Elgort) a cancer survivor with a prosthetic leg and an incredibly optimistic attitude. He holds a cigarette between his teeth but never lights it because to him its a symbol of holding in his mouth the thing that could kill him but not letting it.Yes thats about the level of philosophizing on display here. And it takes awhile to warm up to Elgort and thus Gus. His confidence comes off as cocky at first like hes trying to convince himself that hes going to make the most of his second chance. And who knows maybe it is.Whatever the case Hazel is smitten and they embark upon a unique romance. Much of the film is built around Hazels love for a book about a dying girl written by a reclusive writer (Willem Dafoe). That part of the story doesnt really justify the time spent on it.But watching Woodley does. (Elgort comes around in the end too.) She is captivating. It would be easy to play Hazel in maudlin fashion and judging from the rest of the film Boone wouldnt have minded. But Woodley brings genuine emotion to what is sometimes overwritten teen-dream dialogue.Her Hazel knows who she is and whats going to happen. (There is a powerful moment when she insists on correcting her mother to say not ""if"" she is going to die but ""when."") And yet here she is experiencing something new a change in direction she couldnt have expected.Woodley makes the most of that detour. Her performance above all is whats worth watching here. And if it means shedding a few tears along the way thats a fair price to pay.Review The Fault in Our Stars 3.5 starsDirector Josh Boone.Cast Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort Laura Dern.Rating PG-13 for thematic elements some sexuality and brief strong language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Review The Fault in Our Stars is sad life-affirming and beautiful - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview The Fault in Our Stars is sad life-affirming and beautifulBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News correspondentPosted 06/04/2014 121000 PM PDTUpdated 06/06/2014 015510 PM PDT Related StoriesJun 3Fault in Our Stars Five other teen romances with wide appealAs fans of John Greens best-selling emotionally profound novel already know ""The Fault in Our Stars"" isnt just another cheesy sob story.Greens heartfelt young adult novel about two teens with cancer is much more than that striking a chord that has resonated with readers of all ages who cherish how he touched equally on truths about living and dying while never manipulating or making his story maudlin.The integrity of Greens sad but life-affirming tale is preserved and protected in a beautiful film version from director Josh Boone starring a perfectly cast Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort as the ill-fated couple. Make no doubt this film will make you cry. But Boone keeps it all in control righting the film whenever it seems ready to keel over into unabashed tear-jerker terrain. Screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber who wrote ""(500) Days of Summer"" make an enormous assist by staying true to to the wittiness of the authors characters and situations.Greens 2012 cancer tale succeeded where some others became shamelessly contrived weepers thanks to the distinctive voice of the narrator. Hazel Grace Lancaster (Woodley) the acerbic well-read 16-year-old with thyroid cancer is one of contemporary fictions most unforgettable characters. The book rested on her shoulders even though it got a boost from the charming appearance of Augustus Waters (Elgort) the cute one-legged former basketball player she meets and falls for in a humorously rendered cancer support group.Advertisement Appropriately the screen version rests largely on the talents of Woodley who stands out in every film shes been in so far from ""The Descendants"" to ""Divergent."" Here shes fearless and flawless in a challenging role and it would be ridiculous if this performance were overlooked come Oscar nomination time. Whether shes lugging around her oxygen tank or expressing joy that she might be meeting her favorite author in Amsterdam Woodley plays every roller-coaster mood swing exactly as it should be expressed. On page and screen Hazel is a brittle but highly likable character. She also is fully aware that she is dying and has been throwing up emotional barriers to keep loved ones at a safe distance including her well-intentioned parents (played honestly by Laura Dern and Sam Trammell). In one heartbreaking scene her tough exterior breaks down when she expresses to the sweet-souled Augustus (played with meltable warmth and compassion by ""Divergents"" Elgort) that shes an ""emotional grenade."" This image released by 20th Century Fox shows Ansel Elgort left and Shailene Woodley appear in a scene from ""The Fault In Our Stars."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox James Bridges) ( James Bridges ) Augustus wants to be at Hazels side even when she explodes. Hazel initially doesnt want to get involved but she cant help falling for the puppylike Augustus who wants to be loved by everyone. Once the two swap favorite books -- his based on a video game hers a meaty tome called ""An Imperial Affliction"" written by reclusive writer Peter Van Houten -- the bond grows stronger as they try to communicate with the author (Willem Dafoe in a scaldingly bitter performance) about his open-ended novel. At the same time more health issues arise and the two unite to help Augustus friend Isaac (""Palo Altos"" Nat Wolff) -- whose cancer has claimed one eye and is about to rob him of the other -- get over a bad relationship.It all sounds painfully sad and theres no denying the material demands it be so. But ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is also wise and sometimes funny delicately reminding us to live and love honestly and fully while we all still have that gift.The Fault in our stars    1/2Rating PG-13 (for thematic elements some sexuality and brief strong language)Cast Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort Laura Dern Nat Wolff Willem Dafoe Sam TrammellDirector Josh BooneRunning time 2 hours 5 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

There is the Hollywood way to do it of course. But she says ""this is the truth. Sorry."" Shes not actually sorry and notice is hereby served this is very much the visual version of the wildly popular YA novel complete with voiceover for the choice bits of narration that its legions of fans presumably couldnt live without. (If youre sure youll never tire of Shailene Woodley in closeup this may be your proving ground.) Certain elements translate onto the screen especially the sense that teens live in a private passionate world of their own and must figure out life (and death) accordingly. Parents and caregivers however well-meaning can only hover at the border and hope. That goes double perhaps when the teen has cancer and is crazy about an 18-year-old cancer survivor (Ansel Elgort smirking) with one leg and little to do but love her. Certain other elements remain shackled to their source the rhythm and pacing the piling up of crises the exhausting slide toward the inevitable the weirdly unlikely ending. Points at any rate for the gutsy use of a visit to Anne Franks Amsterdam attic. With Laura Dern Willem Dafoe. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Theres no shortage of tears in The Fault in Our Stars the movie version of John Greens runaway best-seller for the young adult market about the passionate romance between two 18-year-olds with terminal cancer. But sensitive direction by Josh Boone a carefully constructed screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber and a pair of beautifully calibrated lead performances by Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort raise the film above the level of tearjerker and give it a ballast that I predict will reach its target audience with no problem whatsoever--and maybe even touch a few other hard-hearted cynics along the way. The Fault in Our Stars  (3/4 stars) Written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber Directed by Josh Boone Starring Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort and Nat Wolff Running time 125 min. A large portion of intelligence is due to the original author who based his observations about the courage and offbeat humor of the terminally ill on his experiences as a chaplain in a childrens hospital. Theres a lot of religious inspiration in the film I could do without but the characters seem as real as inhaling. Worn out by surgery needles anti-depressants sympathy parental indulgence and eight prescription drugs three times per day Hazel Grace Lancaster (magical riveting Shailene Woodley) meets strapping optimistic Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgot) in a cancer support group. Hazel drags around an oxygen tank and Gus is hampered by a prosthetic leg but they almost instantly discover a kinship forged from a no-shit philosophy and an admirably shared sense of cockeyed humor that jazzes up their outlook on life where medicine has failed. Their attitudes and values may differ but romance is inescapable. They do peculiar things because theyre unusual people. Her dream is to travel to Amsterdam to meet Peter Van Houten a philosophical Dutch writer whose books have influenced her profoundly. Her family cant afford to send her but Gus has saved enough money to fly them both across the Atlantic. Another lung collapse that lands Hazel back in the hospital postpones the trip but hope perseveres and the big middle section of the film centers on the weekend in Amsterdam where their idol turns out to be a seedy rude hostile and unpleasant man in a rage swigging scotch in his dirty pajamas while driving them away in anger and despair. (As Van Houten Willem Dafoe takes the scene hostage in a standout performance.) With his unfailing optimism Gus shrugs off the experience with ""Apparently the world is not a wish-granting factory"" but Hazels devastation haunts her until the end before we at last find out the motives behind the Dutch authors maddening mood shift. (He lives with a tragedy of his own that surfaces in the presence of mortality.) In this movie even the intrusion of an enemy force is so realistically explained that all is forgiven. The Fault in Our Stars has an ambiguous title I still cant explain and it would be just as agreeable at half the length. You get a pain in the ass just waiting for something to happen. But you also get the bravery of gallant kids whose lives are so out of sync with the ordinary happiness we take for granted that they are forced to think ahead including planning their own funeral eulogies. You get compassion and intelligence instead of cracker-barrel homilies. And you get mesmerizing performances. No callow youth with big biceps Mr. Elgort is the quintessence of every parents prayer for the perfect son making his inevitable clash with fate doubly hard to take. Laura Dern is a model of silent pain masked by pragmatism as Hazels mother. But it is really Shailene Woodley as Hazel who melts your heart with a dazzlingly fresh breath of air. She may not be conventionally beautiful by Hollywoods definition but she has an indirect sweetness a paralyzing presence and a vast emotional range that defines star quality on the screen. As a girl who discovers in death the meaning of life she is a rapture to behold. The camera loves her and so will you.

Or rather what kind theyre not about to see. ""I believe we have a choice in this world about how to tell sad stories"" she says. ""On the one hand you can sugarcoat it -- nothing is too messed up that it cant be fixed with a Peter Gabriel song. I like that version as much as the next girl does."" But she concludes thats not the truth. Its been four decades since Love Story turned young love doomed by cancer into saccharine Hallmark hooey. And its safe to say that Hazel Grace would have hated that film. A generation of teens like her have been weaned on YA novels (including the 2012 John Green best-seller this is based on) leading to more discerning palates. They can sniff out condescension from a thousand yards. Thats why theyre lucky to have an actress as effortlessly charismatic and natural as 22-year-old Woodley (The Descendants Divergent) as their stand-in. Her Hazel Grace despite a diagnosis of thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs is nobodys martyr. Shes a sarcastic straight shooter who has accepted her fate and isnt ashamed about the tubes under her nose or the unwieldy oxygen tank she has to lug around like a millstone. Then she meets a cancer survivor named Augustus at a support group and his sunny worldview throws her. Gus played by Woodleys Divergent costar Ansel Elgort lost his leg to the disease but remains unrelentingly upbeat. And he woos Hazel Grace as if his life depended on it; you get the impression that in some ways maybe it does. He takes her on picnics they read each others favorite books. He even whisks her and her mother (an excellent Laura Dern) off to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author. In other words hes too good to be true. Thats the main flaw with Josh Boones otherwise poignant film. In Gus manic wish-fulfillment adorableness hes as eager to please as a litter of cocker-spaniel puppies. Its as grating as it is hard to buy. I realize that complaint may sound heartless and might not wash with fans of the book who have a ton invested in these characters already but I couldnt help wondering what kind of spiky unpredictability a Say Anything-era John Cusack would have brought to the character -- with or without the requisite Peter Gabriel song.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 644 p.m. EDT June 4 2014Ansel Elgort left and Shailene Woodley in The Fault In Our Stars.(Photo James Bridges 20th Century Fox)Pain demands to be felt.Thats a key line in John Greens beloved 2012 best-seller The Fault in Our Starsand a major component in the movie adaptation ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday night in select cities and Friday nationwide).Pain is at the heart of a love story about two strikingly articulate teens living in ""the Republic of Cancervania."" They cope with it daily and wryly acknowledge its torment. The pain depicted is not solely physical though thats a significant component. Emotional agony proves to be the toughest of all.So those unfamiliar with the book should be duly warned Bring plenty of tissues.Stars is an unabashed tearjerker though its also about celebrating life. The movie is well-written well-acted acerbic funny and wisely observed. Fans of the book will be glad to hear it is faithful to Greens tale.Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is a bright and irreverent 16-year-old. Diagnosed with cancer at 13 she has to breathe from a tube connected to an oxygen tank she must carry everywhere. But she will not allow illness to define her.At the behest of her loving mom (Laura Dern) Hazel reluctantly attends a support group for cancer survivors. Still Hazels biggest passion is losing herself in An Imperial Affliction a novel by a mysterious Amsterdam-based author.One afternoon a new boy stops by the support group. Augustus ""Gus"" Waters (Ansel Elgort) is a strapping 17-year-old who has lost part of a leg to cancer. He and Hazel share an instant connection and the whip-smart pair trade barbs strike up a friendship then fall in love.One of the movies biggest assets is its spot-on casting. Woodley so superb in last years The Spectacular Now and 2011s The Descendants comes across as a fusion of soulful wickedly funny and vulnerable. Gus says adorably romantic things like ""It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.""Young girls will swoon over Gus appealing blend of wholesome and rakish. Older audiences will appreciate the naturalistic dialogue.Hazel shares her favorite book with Gus and they lament its abrupt ending longing to know what happened after the last page. Gus cashes in a gift and arranges for the two of them to go to Amsterdam to meet the mysterious author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe).Their encounter with Van Houten is strange but intriguing. However a scene in which they kiss in the Anne Frank House inspiring strangers to applaud stands out for its artificiality (to be fair its also in the book).As co-written by Green and the superb screenwriting team of Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (who wrote (500) Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now) the script makes only minor modifications to the book omitting extraneous characters and non-essential dialogue.Hazel and Gus must endure far more suffering than anyone their age should. That these immensely likable young people should be stricken with terminal illness is supremely unfair making their love story all the more poignant.When things go south they remind each other ""The world is not a wish-granting factory.""The Fault in Our Stars does however grant the audiences wish for a literate exuberant and wise teen romance. 10632 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1hb6jwc",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/04/the-fault-in-our-stars-review/9630351/,200,thefaultinourstars45,thefaultinourstars,usatoday

Photo AP/20th Century Fox MOVIE REVIEW The Fault in Our Stars Running time 125 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexuality profanity terminal cancer). At the Lincoln Square the Magic Johnson the Village 7 others. Ive been known to mist up at a good iced tea commercial so tear-jerkers have a friend in me. But the way ""The Fault in Our Stars"" throws adorable dying teens all over the place strikes me as calculated. At one point I expected the dog from ""Marley amp; Me"" to wander in just to go paws up. Yet the movie version of the breathlessly beloved John Green best-seller (a book that after one page I sadly replaced on its shelf but only because I had no lighter fluid and matches at hand) partly redeems itself with a thoughtful second half. In the end to my surprise the rusty gears of the waterworks began to whir. Ansel Elgort Nat Wolff and Shailene Woodley in ""The Fault in Our Stars""Photo AP/20th Century Fox Shailene Woodley already a subtle and rangy actress easily carries the film as Hazel a worldly-wise teen living with terminal cancer who at a lame support group instantly falls for a jocular jock named Gus (Ansel Elgort trying too hard to be charming) who lost a leg to cancer and is not yet out of danger. For comic relief theres a sidekick (Nat Wolff) who has lost both eyes and enjoys wrecking stuff. Ive no objection to getting rich pandering to tweens. Nor do I find wisecracks an inferior coping strategy to say religion or therapy but couldnt the movie come up with some witty ones? Instead the script is littered with cliches ""Welcome to my humble abode"" ""So yeah that just happened"" ""This silence is deafening."" Even attempts to be profound come out like this ""Cancer sucks."" The emo soundtrack is sweetly endearing but some portion of the dialogue should have been rewritten. Say 97 percent of it. The romance progresses fitfully and with a curious lack of sensuality (Ive seen handshakes that were lustier than the sex scene). The girl and the boy break up then think better of it. Theres no money to go to Amsterdam where their favorite writer lives until suddenly there is. Gus (Elgort) and Hazel (Woodley) take in scenic Amsterdam in ""The Fault in Our Stars.""Photo AP/20th Century Fox That Dutch-American author played by Willem Dafoe as a surly crank in pajamas who has scotch for breakfast steers the movie in a more mature direction He compares the couples childish belief that the characters in his book continued existing after the final page to the equally absurd belief in life after death. The teens reflecting on a lesson we should all learn (no author can live up to what he is on the page) have their first kiss at . . . the Anne Frank House. Yet the scene works. Take that cancer. You Nazi. In the second half with the forced jauntiness largely forgone the movie takes a deep breath and realizes its nobler to be an effective formula drama than a wan comedy. Yes this is still a hypocritical Real Deal that shows someone undergo chemo without mussing let alone losing any hair. But the contemplation of teens picking out their own funeral clothes and writing eulogies to one another is sweet heartbreak. No miracle beckons having a loving family only does so much and there is much talk of oblivion. Hey but look on the bright side At least nobody in this movie will ever have to see ""The Amazing Spider-Man 3.""

Though its correctly categorized as a teen romance ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is above all a movie about cancer. Cancer provides the butt of the films most caustic jokes provides the magnetic pull that first draws its star-crossed couple together and provides the power with which the story eventually starts to squeeze its viewers tear ducts like water balloons in a pressure cooker. As such it walks a knifes edge between heart-on-sleeve sensitivity and crass exploitation for its entire running time and the fact that it largely stays on the right side of that divide has to mark it as a success. Soulfully acted especially by a never-better Shailene Woodley and several degrees smarter than most films aimed at teenagers this Fox melodrama ought to strike a resonant chord with young audiences. Based on John Greens bestselling novel the film offers the first-person accounts of Hazel Grace Lancaster (Woodley) a bright 16-year-old who can hardly remember not living with cancer. She came perilously close to death as a preteen but an experimental ""miracle"" treatment beat her disease back to relatively manageable levels She has to breathe from a tube tethered to an oxygen tank she lugs around like a carry-on bag and her lifespan has no clear prognosis but shes far from helpless. Her parents (Laura Dern Sam Trammell) are a loving lovable pair who worry that Hazel is becoming depressed as she has no friends and spends her time endlessly rereading reclusive author Peter Van Houtens postmodern cancer-themed novel ""An Imperial Affliction."" After some insistently gentle prodding she agrees to attend a weekly church-basement support group hosted by sappy Jesus freak Patrick (Mike Birbiglia). Here she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort) a strapping clever impossibly handsome 18-year-old whose basketball career was cut short when cancer took his right leg but who appears to have since made a full recovery. He asks Hazel out on a series of chaste hangout dates reads her favorite book stays up until the wee hours on the phone with her and ever-so-gradually brings her out of her shell. Hazel is a great character tart without being cynical vulnerable without being needy and capable of tossing out bons mots like ""Im the Keith Richards of cancer kids"" without seeming like a writerly construct. Augustus is decidedly less developed essentially functioning as a male version of the types of restorative free spirits usually played by Kate Hudson and Kirsten Dunst in Cameron Crowe movies and prone to dandyish flourishes -- particularly his habit of brandishing an unlit cigarette as a sort of totemistic charm against death -- that surely worked better as literary metaphors than visual ones. But their rapport is believable their chemistry palpable and the film is never more likable than when it unhurriedly lingers on their low-key courtship. A few weeks into their relationship Augustus springs a big surprise Calling in a favor from a Make-A-Wish-type foundation hes arranged a trip for the two of them to Amsterdam where Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) has apparently agreed to sit down with Hazel and answer her infinite questions about his book. (In one of the pics most darkly funny scenes Augustus mocks Hazel for wasting her wish on a trip to Disney World ""pre-miracle."") Its in Amsterdam that the film opens up visually -- ditching the closeups and domestic interior scenes to take in the well-photographed surroundings -- and Hazel and Augustus forge their most affecting connections. Its also the only section where the film tips fully over into uncomfortable kitsch as the couple experiences a romantic breakthrough during a visit to Anne Franks attic while voiceovers recite passages from ""The Diary of a Young Girl."" The film may get away with using cancer to tug the heartstrings but combining cancer and the Holocaust is at least one trigger too many. But this glaring misstep only goes to demonstrate just how well the film has navigated these choppy waters thus far. Director Josh Boone is hardly the most distinctive cinematic stylist but hes smart enough to let his scenes linger for a few beats longer than most mainstream directors would and seems to trust his actors to carry their own dramatic weight. Woodley repays that trust in spades. With close-cropped hair and minimal makeup she eschews any overly theatrical tics rarely oversells her characters goodness and wit -- even when her lines seem to be begging for it -- and manages to convincingly convey terminal illness without invoking easy pathos. Though her character may be 16 Woodleys performance is thoroughly adult and offers a reminder that while the occasional multipart blockbuster franchise like ""Divergent"" can theoretically be part of a balanced diet for a young actress she has much more to offer the cinema than an ability to run through obstacle courses while mouthing mealy mythology. Woodleys ""Divergent"" co-star Elgort cant match her level of naturalism and his cocky smirking self-confidence never quite jibes with his displays of boundless selflessness where Hazel is concerned but hes ultimately charming enough to wear down most resistance. The screenplay adapted by ""The Spectacular Now"" scripters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber does contain a few clunkers and lays it on a bit thick toward the end with a procession of scenes ruthlessly rigged to target the few remaining dry eyes in the theater. But on the whole the scribes give their audience a good deal of credit looping in some interesting references to neuroethics and calculus without overexplaining or dumbing them down.

I thought he was great all around in the movie. He and Woodley had a great on screen charisma. Reply Laura says June 21 2014 at 252 am Why are the references to neuroethics a good thing? Everything that van houten tells to the young couple makes no sense in any contex other than the use of the infinity in hazels eulogy in which she describes their unlikely but in the movie somwhat convincing love story. The reference to the trolley bus is even more ridiculous. It seems that the author just wanted to randomly put in something he could teach the audience. When aaron sorkin does that everybody hates it Reply Sarah says June 4 2014 at 125 pm What I find interesting and what I am curious to witness in the film is the reviewers response to the Anne Frank House scene. I thought it was incredibly mellow in the book- just a lot of struggling with the stairs- and it was Hazels internal monologue that made the scene make sense in the overall story for me while reading. But I think I can understand how maybe some of that is lost in a film adaptation. Im also so excited that this is going to be a huge blockbuster that feratures the ill and the disabled but one that also focuses on them as people and their lives outside of their illness. Im happy that FOX took this on as Im sure the subject matter isnt necessarily their standard blockbuster material Reply Abby says June 3 2014 at 1015 pm Its difficult to take a book as popular as this and make it perfect. But based on this review it sounds like the filmmakers have done a pretty amazing job of following Greens work. Which if youve read the story is why the end ""lays it on thick."" The novel takes a complete turn on their trip to Amsterdam and I found myself struggling to get through the end without going through a box of tissues because of the emotional roller coaster the reader is taken on. Reply Scott MacDonough says June 3 2014 at 854 pm Trust me. This is going to be the summers biggest moneymaker and will hopefully kill off all the announced sequels to the underperforming CGI blockbusters. Repeat viewings from teenaged girls (nothing wrong with that) will send this ""sleeper"" into the record books. Reply Mjkbk says June 3 2014 at 823 pm I havent read the book but......Hazels ""loving lovable parents"" send her to a ""Jesus freak"" for counseling support? Really? Is that how Green a devout Episcopalian described it in his novel? Wow. ""Freak"". Thats some epithet to use for a religious man trying to help sick dying people. Im an atheist whose family includes wonderful members YOU would label as ""freaks"". Real nice. Reply kristenwalsh101 says June 6 2014 at 718 am Those are the reviewers words not Johns. He graduated from Kenyon College in 2000 with a double major in English and Religious Studies so I dont think he woud call Patrick a Jesus Freak Reply Laurie Mann says June 6 2014 at 427 pm Patrick was played a little more for broad comedy in the movie...not quite so much in the book. Andrew M. Barker says June 3 2014 at 639 pm You are correct. I blame the inventor of the qwerty keyboard for putting the v right next to the b. Fixed. Reply Mr. Average says June 3 2014 at 416 pm The reviewer seems to have strong misgivings despite trying very hard to convince readers that this is a ""good"" movie. Reply Kristen Walsh says June 6 2014 at 718 am Those are the reviewers words not Johns. He graduated from Kenyon College in 2000 with a double major in English and Religious Studies so I dont think he woud call Patrick a Jesus Freak Reply kristenwalsh101 says June 6 2014 at 719 am srry wrong post peter says June 3 2014 at 408 pm I am crying simply from reading this review Reply Michael Anthony says June 3 2014 at 557 pm Lord have mercy.

TWITTER Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort star in Josh Boones adaptation of John Greens best-selling young adult novel. With interest in adapting John Greens fourth novel running high even before its 2012 debut atop The New York Times best-seller list Twilight producers Wyck Godfrey and Marty Bowen managed to snatch up the film rights to the hugely popular narrative which may have been a bit of a ""be careful what you wish for"" moment. With the books millions of adoring fans eagerly anticipating the movies release a distinct risk of blow-back was practically built in to the project. Fortunately director Josh Boone and his filmmaking team appear to have minimized the downside in part by casting fast-rising star Shailene Woodley in the lead along with her Divergent franchise co-star Ansel Elgort. Both are likely to be strong selling points with the films youth-skewing target audience which is being further softened up by a robust marketing campaign and Greens own substantial social media presence. With the onset of summer vacation and few similar distractions in theaters at the outset The Fault in Our Stars should perform strongly out of the gate with the potential to show significant staying power in the weeks following. PHOTOS The Most Popular YA Properties Adapted for TV and Film If any teenager can reasonably be described as ""ordinary"" then 16-year-old Hazel Grace Lancaster (Woodley) is far from it. A cancer survivor since the age of 13 shes fully in possession of both keen intelligence and sharp wit if not her health - a challenging combination for a kid who could clearly do with a few more friends than she actually has. Instead her most constant companions are the oxygen tank connected to the breathing tube that supports her seriously compromised lungs along with her concerned mother Frannie (Laura Dern) and protective father Michael (Sam Trammell). Hazel gets a chance to branch out when at the urging of both her mom and her doctor she joins an often lame though occasionally amusing church-based cancer-survivor support group where she meets 18-year-old Augustus ""Gus"" Waters (Elgort) an equally precocious teen with a rather more constructive outlook than Hazels. Despite losing a leg to cancer his disease is in remission and hes dreaming of new ways to conquer the world along with his best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) whos battling the affliction as well. Irreverent rather than cynical he freely shares that he intends to ""live an extraordinary life"" and bonds with Hazel over her favorite book An Imperial Affliction written by Dutch-American author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) which just happens to be about living with cancer. RELATED Why Fault in Our Stars Author John Green Is Freaking Out About Hollywood Success Hazel is borderline obsessed with contacting the elusive Van Houten but he never responds to her missives. So its a bit shocking and even overwhelming when the writers assistant replies to an email from Gus soliciting information about Van Houtens book. Then Hazel gets a message from Van Houten himself and the author invites her to visit if shes ever in Amsterdam. Hazel and Gus who often insists on calling her ""Hazel Grace"" quickly cook up a plan to make the trip but its nixed by Hazels doctors and parents concerned that the stress of the journey will strain her lungs and disrupt the experimental cancer-drug treatment shes dependent on for her survival. Meanwhile Gus is falling hard for Hazel who is fairly smitten herself but as her condition worsens she pulls back telling Gus ""Im a grenade and one day Im going to explode and obliterate everything in my wake."" Undeterred he counters that her withdrawal doesnt lessen his affection for her and when he manages to find an unexpected method of funding their travel the plan is back on again. As both teens face suddenly critical health issues however the outcome of both the trip and their increasingly romantic relationship becomes appreciably more uncertain. RELATED Fault in Our Stars Tracking for Big Opening Weekend The greatest strengths of the film clearly come from Greens novel which resolutely refuses to become a cliched cancer drama creating instead two vibrant believable young characters filled with humor and intelligence both facing complex questions and issues unimaginable even to people twice their age. Turning the screenwriting over to adaptation experts Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber has preserved the distinctly literate tone of the book even if they do occasionally deliver scenes that feel overwrought. The script makes an excellent fit for Woodley whose feature film career really took off with The Descendants and The Spectacular Now two similarly smart self-aware films. Woodleys wise and accomplished take on Hazel Lancaster will resonate with those inclined to view the world with a somewhat skeptical point of view although they may face similar resistance to the prospect of romance entering her life. By dint of ample charm and considerable insight Elgorts Gus represents more than a foil for Hazels self-doubt - he offers her the opportunity to mold all of her hope and frustration into a fully three-dimensional transcendent emotional experience whether she wants to call that ""love"" or not. As Hazels protective but practical parents Dern and Trammell display a realistic degree of concern without completely smothering her and when crisis erupts their instinctual compassion quickly restores calm. Wolff whose character loses both eyes to cancer provides some suitably dark humor although its left to Dafoe as the acerbic author whose young daughter succumbed to the disease to deftly deliver the films least reassuring perspective. STORY The Fault in Our Stars What the Critics Are Saying Boones appropriately light touch emphasizes the underlying literary material foregrounding the performances with occasional underplayed visual humor and reserving stylistic nuance for more contemplative scenes attractively framed by cinematographer Ben Richardson. Mike Mogis and Nate Walcotts score somewhat literally underlines the overly insistent folky-leaning soundtrack selections from the likes of Tom Odell Lykke Li and Ray LaMontagne.

All Rights Reserved. Not for Sale or Duplication. Cancer so costly in real life can be thrown around pretty cheaply in fiction which is why most cautious readers and moviegoers are wary of it as a plot element. Call it the Love Story syndrome. But the presence of mortal illness has always been a staple of romantic melodrama the X factor that raises the emotional stakes to levels that are either sublime or ridiculous with a blurry line in between. In the hands of the right storyteller a little cancer cant hurt Stories about lovers separated by circumstance are evergreen; death is the ultimate circumstance; and cancer sometimes though not always leads to untimely death. In the plumbing mechanics of melodrama the Big C makes a perfectly useful faucet handle Turn it and the tears come out or at least they ought to. In life its cancers job to try to kill you. In fiction its cancers job to make you cry. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In John Greens ferociously popular young-adult novel The Fault in Our Stars cancer does its job like a pro. Colloquial breezy and laced with black humor -- the adjective ""cancertastic"" may not yet be part of the dealing-with-cancer lexicon but it should be -- the book is very much loved and not just by teenagers. Without being too maudlin or sticky it effectively opens up the cathartic flow. Youd think or at least hope that 35-year-old director Josh Boones film adaptation which hews close to the book would do the same. But something gets stuck in the pipeline The Fault in Our Stars doesnt quite capture the discreetly twisted humor or the muted anger of Greens book and its problems can be attributed to a constellation of little annoyances rather than any one serious North Star-size flaw. Even so Im reluctant to damn it. In the world of todays movies so reliant on comic-book plots in which People Youre Supposed to Care About (but Perhaps Dont) are ignobly offed with a massive CGI flourish there needs to be a place for teen melodrama. The Fault in Our Stars at least tries to fill it.Shailene Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster a 17-year-old whose lungs have betrayed her; as she puts it they suck at being lungs. A ""miracle"" cancer drug has helped but she knows her illness will kill her sooner than later. She walks through life slowly an oxygen tank on wheels trailing behind her like the sick kids version of an adventurers suitcase oxygen-delivery nubbins tucked into her nostrils. Her concerned-but-cool mom (Laura Dern doing justice to middle-age moms everywhere with her laid-back grooviness) urges her to attend a church support group. Ugh. Really Mom? But there Hazel meets an 18-year-old boy with a stunning smirk and a fake leg. Hes lost that limb to cancer but otherwise hes doing A-OK.Film Details The Fault in Our Stars RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time125 More Info Trailer Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort) is a philosophical ex-basketball player with a tendency toward grandiose pronouncements. Just after their first meeting he shocks Hazel by sticking a cigarette in his mouth -- the look on her face says ""How could you? Around me with my crap lungs?"" But his shtick is clenching cigarettes between his pillowy lips without lighting them That way he explains he accepts their power to kill him without granting them the power to kill him. Hazel thinks this is cool; she is just 17 after all. And while the attraction between Hazel and Augustus is instantaneous shes cautious about letting it blossom into a love affair -- she doesnt want to leave him with a painful hole in his heart when shes gone. Her resolve doesnt last and it shouldnt. Eventually a novel or more specifically a churlish novelist (played by Willem Dafoe so perversely transfixing with his pointy little goblin teeth) brings them closer leading to a highly dubious first kiss way upstairs at the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. Where else?Theres plenty in The Fault in Our Stars thats hard to buy though thats not by itself a problem. Woodley is an appealing actress who gives her character some moderately believable shape though she needs to be reeled back in her big dramatic moments when her voice hits the high nut-busting notes of a hectoring chipmunk. Elgort set to be the teen heartthrob of the moment (he has already appeared in Carrie and Divergent) presents a bigger complication. His character is given to loquacious soliloquies that need to be looser funnier and Elgort cant navigate them without sounding annoying and pompous. We know why Hazel likes him but hes the kind of first boyfriend you need to enjoy for a while and then get away from not take deep into your heart as the truest love ever. And that unfortunately is where the story locks him.Then again The Fault in Our Stars is a teenage fantasy albeit one rooted in the not-so-sunny world of cancer. And there are certain aspects of this half-dreamy half-earthbound romance that Boone -- who has made just one other feature the 2012 dramatic comedy Stuck in Love -- gets just right. As Hazel and Augustus gets to know one another he asks her what her story is and she prattles on with a list of treatments diagnoses and close calls. He stops her mid-sentence ""Not your cancer story your real story."" Boone and his actors cut straight to the idea that cancer gives you an unwanted identity becoming if you let it the only thing that defines you. All teenagers are looking for identity but who wants that one? Its the third wheel in Hazel and Augustuss love story unwanted and always hanging around. Its also the thing that will make their story really really sad. Sometimes a good cry is just what the doctor ordered.
