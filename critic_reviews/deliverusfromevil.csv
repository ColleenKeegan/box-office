His latest based on ex-NYPD cop turned paranormal investigator Ralph Sarchies 2001 memoir suffers from the same weaknesses. Eric Bana plays Sarchie a lapsed Catholic with a murky past an adrenaline-junkie partner and an uncanny radar for abuse cases involving wives children and pets. He is drawn back to the path of righteous by plain-clothes Spanish priest Mendoza (Edgar Ramirez) who believes that three domestic abuse cases linking three Iraq war veterans have their source in something more than post-traumatic stress disorder. A pre-credits episode in an Iraqi cave daubed with obscure Latin inscriptions and an incident in which a soldiers wife throws her baby into the zoos lion enclosure suggest the priest may have a point. An impressively staged climactic exorcism during which British actor Sean Harriss devil-possessed ex-soldier contorts his body and distorts his voice in distressing ways compensates in part for the random far-fetched storytelling that precedes it.

"Small(er) Movie Roundup Boyhood Deliver Us From Evil Life Itself and More << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup Boyhood Deliver Us From Evil Life Itself and More IFC Films Movies July 16 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Boyhood directed by Richard Linklater As Richard Linklaters family drama makes its way around the country the accompanying stories of its making will lure the curious -- stories about the dozen years he his crew and cast devoted to shaping and shooting of this movie. It was made off and on loosely adhering to the personal growth of the actor playing the boy at its center. Ellar Coltrane was in or near the first grade when his performance as Mason Jr. began. In the final shot hes a college freshman. The formal device sounds like a gimmick -- filmmaking that is holistic sustainable organic. The farm is the table the table is the farm and on and on. But to sit with this movie and witness the concentrated passage of time is to watch in a true moving way your life unspool before your eyes without fanfare or idealism or romance. The years pass with a simple cut as gradual and seamless as evolution itself. There is nothing quite like the brightness in Masons 5- or 6-year-old face when Mason Sr. (Ethan Hawke) finally comes to Texas to visit him and Masons sister Samantha (Linklaters daughter Lorelei). Its the face of Christmas mornings and surprise birthdays a face of innocence. Eventually you notice the lighting leaving it. Somewhere toward the middle of the movie a teenage Mason bounds down a flight of stairs -- his hair oily his face pimpled the pudginess that gave him a cherubs adorability having melted off his lanky frame -- and I gasped. Where did the time go? The audacity of the format belies the modest ambition of the story on display. Boyhood is actually the story of a single mother who wants the best for her children but also for herself. Masons father and mother Olivia (Patricia Arquette) had children when they were very young. The relationship didnt work out. Mason Sr. went off to work in Alaska and drive cool cars. Olivia raises a family puts herself through college and twice marries poorly. The children are not the center of her universe. Theyre two enormous planets. Her children are growing and changing. So is she. Theres a moment when she looks at her young-adult son and says through tears something so deeply honest that it hurts not to be able to hold her. Mason Sr. enjoys the relative luxury of the non-custodial parent Hes aspired-to hes awesome and he gets to grow up and into fatherhood taking the kids camping and to post campaign lawn signs for Barack Obama in 2008. The breezy cool-guy routine Hawke does so well here is the opposite of Arquettes extraordinary micro-climates pride anger fear resentment surprise wonder disappointment and unconditional love sometimes right there in one reaction shot. The movie is called Boyhood but the world Linklaters conceived is grand enough to include the most poignant depiction of a single mother I can think of. The form here is the content. Linklater is almost philosophical about becoming who you are. His filmmaking tends to veer in and out of shagginess. Strong images dont come naturally to him. He is as they say a people person -- a man of places too. Mason Jr. Samantha and Olivia seem to tumble across Texas and as they do you wonder how the upheaval has wounded and strengthened them. Mason Jr. develops oddball distrust of systems and social conventions. Spiritually at least hes the son of Linklaters Slacker. He sits in the desert a plaintive pontificating unambitious teenager looking more or less for the meaning of life. The light in his face is gone. Twelve years later its moved to his soul. Land Ho directed by Martha Stephens and Aaron Katz Andrew Reed/Sony Pictures Classics Are you tired of death and insurrection and monkeys and machines of Jolie and Cruise? Do you wish you could experience some far-flung place that requires an actual passport? Does the idea of 90 minutes with a horny old Texan stoner and his milder-mannered Australian ex-brother-in-law having the time of their lives for a few days in Iceland appeal to you? Then by all means run to Stephens and Katzs comedy. Its one of the best happiest movies of the year. Youll exit better than high. Youll leave on a trampoline. The premise fits on a beer coaster. Mitch (Earl Lynn Nelson) has a big body big money and a big mouth. He also has a big heart. Hes planned a trip to Iceland for him and his buddy Colin whos still sad about the end of his marriage and plans to sulk. But Mitch wins and to some extent so does Colin (Paul Eenhoorn). They experience the natural wonders of the country. They get drunk high laid and lost. They do some deep thinking. They dance. What Stephens and Katz achieve is done with a high degree of difficulty. They find the comedy in the odd-couple pairing of personalities and nationalities and tastes without losing the human thread that keeps Mitchs larger-than-life-ness from leaving the planet. Its funny when his volubility gets under Colins skin. But Colin too is human and he cannot resist his friends charisma. Neither can a lot of the respectfully drawn women whose paths Mitch and Colin cross. One of them a Canadian photographer (Alice Olivia Clarke) is so richly magnetic that you want to see the movie of her travels. Often a buddy movie has to find a dramatic gear to get an audience to care. But the scenarios arent pushed too hard and the filmmakers have worked out a number of bits for Nelson and Eenhoorn to improvise their way around. You always feel a blowup coming between them. But theyre having too much fun for Colin to stay mad. Yes this is yet another bromance but for people who remember when that was just called friendship. Life Itself directed by Steve James Magnolia Pictures Boyhood and Land Ho feel very much like the sort of introspective affirmation of existence Roger Ebert wouldve admired toward the end of his life. His film criticism had achieved an enviable capacity for empathy. His favorable opinions swelled after he was diagnosed with cancer in 2005 and they werent fashionable. But to read him was to read a man communing with movies at a higher emotional register particularly during the final years. James was present with a camera during this period. The resulting documentary adapts Eberts 2011 memoir and chronicles his Illinois childhood his years as an alcoholic Chicago journalist his professional marriage to Gene Siskel and his romantic marriage to Chaz Hammel-Smith. For James the movies less formally rigorous than a landmark like Hoop Dreams or an epic masterpiece like The Interrupters. Its an elegy a eulogy and a valentine one that honors some of the warts of Eberts character and presents Chaz as a pillar of loving reason. James skips the aftermath of Siskels death in 1999 -- the many attempts to fill his seat. We dont hear a peep from Eberts second partner Richard Roeper for instance. But it is generous enough to make Siskel a fully developed character. The passages about his rivalry with Ebert are the films strongest. They shared a complicated ambivalence with each other. Their fame simply compounds your fascination with their mutual fascination. Many people learned how to watch movies by watching them talk about what they watched myself included. Some of those people write about movies because Ebert empowered them to do so. Life Itself makes clear how much Ebert meant to moviegoers and moviemakers (like Martin Scorsese Gregory Nava and Ramin Bahrani) -- a lot. It also makes clear that Ebert didnt want to partake in a movie that sweetened who he was. Hed be proud to know that the movie of his life is sugar-free. Begin Again directed by John Carney Andrew Schwartz/The Weinstein Company So let me get this straight. The owner of an independent record label that once had a hand in discovering and distributing cutting-edge music is fired from his company. One night hes drunk facedown at a bar when suddenly he hears the music that saves his life. Its a young Englishwoman a guitar and a song. This is music so good that he peels himself up has a gander at the stage and envisions the unused instruments suddenly supplying accompaniment by playing themselves so the movie audience just sees a pair of floating drumsticks and levitating violin bow. After decades at the vanguard of cool this guy finds the woman so irresistible that he risks what little cachet he has left to record her debut record in alleys and apartments and rooftops. Those who arent amazed by his commitment and her integrity are laughing at the sheer preposterousness of it all. His attraction to her sound is like Mario Batali falling in love with a bowl of brown water and vegetables that he plans to sell to the world as minestrone. Keira Knightley plays the songwriter who happens to sing. For the first time this good actor really is just a bowl of water and celery. And Mark Ruffalo is the music veteran. He spends the movie careening around Manhattan in his vintage Jaguar a brown cigarette dangling from lips most of the time. The only other actor Ive seen play such a stupid part with this kind of admirable but ridiculous passion is well Mark Ruffalo. Who would flip for songs that would make Starbucks throw up its hands? Knightley has her heart broken by her old writing partner turned pop star (Adam Levine). Ruffalo is trying to fall back in with his estranged wife (Catherine Keener bitterly coupled again) and daughter (Hailee Steinfeld truculently teenaged once more). Neither woman is very good; both look miserable. Carney also made Once the most redundant musical romance in the history of the art form. It was the equivalent of ordering a replacement cable and having it come in a three-foot box of packing peanuts. The new movie is worse. Theres no cable. They play songs in open spaces as double acts of ingenuity and rebellion Screw the studio But we seemed to be hearing at least a partial recording of these sessions so the production conceit remains just that. And would Knightleys optimistic busker friend (James Corden) really pause his own stalled musical career to do sound and throw parties for her? The trouble with this movie -- aside from its lack of visual wonder and musical shape -- is that you dont trust its priorities. Right before it cuts to Ruffalo squabbling with Knightley theres a cut to the act who follows her. Hes just a dude with a guitar but his voice is chowder by comparison. How can you respect a movie whose protagonist believes that Knightleys thin flat singing and her characters dear-blog lyrics are good one who envisions either the future of music or college tuition payments? Even Levines nasal bleat has charisma. With him and Corden and the dude with the guitar theres too much evident talent to take seriously the movies endorsement of Knightley. But after two weeks the movies on its way to becoming a hit in part Im guessing because of pop music-geek draws like Levine and Corden and partly because Knightley is meant to represent authentic artistic integrity. The putative villain is Ruffalos business partner whos played by Yasiin Bey the former Mos Def. Its utterly surreal to have a rapper be The Man. His terms differ from Knightleys. She wants to sell the album only for what its worth which is 1. Needless to say the people behind Begin Again are selling both the soundtrack and the film for many times more. But after only 20 minutes of this movie even her price feels steep. Deliver Us From Evil directed by Scott Derrickson Screen Gems Desperate to re-create the sensation of last summers The Conjuring this exorcism horror-thriller swears its true. If youve seen the posters the tag line is so enormous that youre free to think the words ""inspired by the actual accounts of an NYPD sergeant"" are the star of this movie. As it is you have to work hard to find Eric Banas name. But he and his not-terrible Bronx accent are in almost every scene. As Ralph Sarchie hes the very fit cop who pokes around crime scenes unaware that his penchant for hearing and seeing what others cannot are a calling against Satan. Sarchie gets mixed up in a lot of paranormal activity that walks right up to his doorstep where his wife (Olivia Munn) and daughter (Lulu Wilson) spend a lot of time without him. Thankfully theres a sexy demonologist priest (Edgar Ramirez) to help out wearing leather jackets drinking alcohol and taking deep drags on cigarettes. These two discuss Sarchies renunciation of God and the priests old life as a junkie. Together they uncover weirdness that leads to soldiers in the Iraq War. But its a conspiracy unworthy of your intrigue. Sarchie and his smart-ass partner (Joel McHale whose performance here was all done at the gym) are in one eye-rolling scenario after the next. Derricksons been here before -- he made 2005s The Exorcism of Emily Rose which is the best-worst demonic possession movie Ive seen and 2012s Sinister a pale The Shining knockoff in which evil body-snatches Ethan Hawke. This movie appears to have saved all of its money for the exorcism itself whose exhaustiveness is something to see. Its like watching two men try to put out a fire with water balloons. But this is cheap horror with none of the parental angst or memorable imagery that gave The Conjuring its kick. Deliver Us From Evil is content to be sick (hey self-cannibalism) and cheap. This is the sort of movie that leans hard on a sludgy hissing sound design to work your nerves (they just got on mine) and animals that leap out of nowhere to make you leap from your seat. If you didnt know that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie the boot prints on your eardrums wouldve clued you in.

Comments click to enlarge Deliver Us From Evil Video Rated R  117 minutes  2014 In this Exorcist knockoff Eric Bana plays a lapsed Catholic policeman who rediscovers his faith while investigating a series of crimes whose perpetrators are all possessed by the devil. Director Scott Derrickson (Sinister) demonstrates a knack for atmosphere but little sense of pacing; some sequences are effectively spooky (particularly one set at the Bronx Zoo) though just as many feel uninspired and the longer dialogue scenes stop the movie dead in its tracks. Theres a nicely modulated performance from Edgar Ramirez as a drug-addict-turned-priest that hints at the more accomplished film this might have been.

Andrew Schwartz/Screen Gems hide caption toggle caption Andrew Schwartz/Screen Gems Based on the accounts given by a former NYPD sergeant Deliver Us From Evil follows Ralph Sarchie a New York police officer played by Eric Bana as he investigates unexplainable crimes. Andrew Schwartz/Screen Gems For decades cop dramas have depicted the South Bronx as the devils playground. Deliver Us From Evil takes that idea all too literally. But then this slow-witted occult thriller takes everything literally from the Catholic rite of exorcism to Jim Morrisons shamanic posturing. The movie is derived from a book of the same name by former NYPD Sgt. Ralph Sarchie who reportedly came to believe that some of the criminals he faced were literally possessed. Wisely director and co-scripter Scott Derrickson made the on-screen Sarchie (stolidly intense Eric Bana) a skeptic. The cop is a lapsed Catholic who gave up on God when he was 12 although he does believe in the power of his internal ""radar"" to locate the most interesting cases. Hes also unsurprisingly wracked with Catholic guilt. And not just about how he neglects his wife Jen (Olivia Munn) and 6-year-old daughter Christina (Lulu Wilson). Of course the role of skeptics in movies like this is to be brutally converted to a magical worldview. Just as the job of 6-year-old daughters is to be threatened by the storys archvillain. That fiend is introduced in a prologue set in Iraq four years ago. During a battle three American soldiers stumble upon the entrance to a spooky ill-lighted subterranean chamber. Naturally they enter thus setting the precedent for a movie where Sarchie is forever exploring gloomy basements and other dark ominous crypts. At one point he even walks into an actual lions den. A series of horrific seemingly senseless crimes connect to the three Iraq War veterans led by gaunt and grisly Santino (Sean Harris in hoodie and goth face paint). Some of Santinos victims babble song lyrics that Sarchie recognizes. In fact hes started to hear the same tunes in his head. Theyre by the Doors which at least makes them more listenable than the music of say Cannibal Corpse. i While investigating disturbing and supernatural-linked crimes NYPD officer Ralph Sarchie gains the help of Father Mendoza a Jesuit priest and exorcist played by Edgar Ramirez. Andrew Schwartz/Screen Gems hide caption toggle caption Andrew Schwartz/Screen Gems While investigating disturbing and supernatural-linked crimes NYPD officer Ralph Sarchie gains the help of Father Mendoza a Jesuit priest and exorcist played by Edgar Ramirez. Andrew Schwartz/Screen Gems Then Sarchie meets Mendoza (Edgar Ramirez) a bad-boy priest and free-range exorcist whos too sexy for his cassock. Curiously both he and several of Santinos victims speak Spanish or Italian as their first language. Satanic vexation is apparently a Latin tendency although the ultimate source of the evil were told is Babylonian. (Until now it was not widely known that ancient Mesopotamian djinns really dug the Doors.) Ultimately viewers are treated to what seems to be the most protracted exorcism scene ever filmed. But maybe its merely for all its gore and noise the most boring. Either way its time for Derrickson who also directed The Exorcism of Emily Rose to master a new ritual. Christina has a scary jack-in-the-box but by the time it starts acting up viewers have already experienced at least an hour of things jumping out at them. Stuffed with shock cuts and bloody brawls Deliver Us From Evil is often well edited although its music is spliced less artfully. TV jester Joel McHale plays Sarchies partner yet the two mens banter is some of the grimmest in exorcist/cop-drama history. (Switching Indy Jones ""I hate snakes"" to ""I hate cats"" does not qualify as wit.) At least the characters might have made a few cracks about the frequent downpours. The devil may have all the best tunes but in Deliver Us From Evil he just cant catch a break from the rain.

Photo Credit AP / Andrew Schwartz advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A skeptical New York City cop and a Jesuit priest team up to solve a series of crimes. Rated R (violence gore language) BOTTOM LINE A surprisingly strong cast and solid direction make all the malarkey in this horror flick tolerable. CAST Eric Bana Edgar Ramirez Olivia Munn LENGTH 157 Robbery murder pedophilia -- New York City police sergeant Ralph Sarchie has seen it all. ""Where was God when all that was happening?"" he asks Jesuit priest Joe Mendoza while they chug shots in a bar. Maybe God is in Sarchie himself Mendoza counters. Forget the problem of evil he says ""What about the problem of good?"" Its a memorable twist on an age-old exchange in ""Deliver Us From Evil"" an exorcism flick thats far more compelling than its genre usually requires. Thanks to a fine cast solid direction by Scott Derrickson and an idiosyncratic soundtrack by The Doors the movies mandatory cliches -- Latin invocations gurgling demons -- are far more tolerable than usual. The material is based on Sarchies nonfiction book (hes now a practicing demonologist) but you dont have to believe this movie to enjoy it. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Eric Bana (""Lone Survivor"") plays Sarchie as a humorless workaholic while Joel McHale (NBCs ""Community"") is his irreverent partner Butler. The actors work well together especially during the films first act an enjoyably creepy ride-along through alleys basements and rather delightfully the Bronx Zoo. The movies stealth star though is Venezuelan actor Edgar Ramirez (""Zero Dark Thirty"") who plays Mendoza as a street-wise priest with a glamorously checkered past. Mendoza is a fiction (Derrickson co-wrote the script with Paul Harris Boardman) but Ramirez gives him such rock-star mystique -- hes like Lou Reed with a crucifix -- that youll wish he were real. When the believer finally convinces the skeptic that a demon is on the loose ""Deliver Us From Evil"" begins to drag. An Iraq War vet (Sean Harris) emerges as our villain and Sarchies family (Olivia Munn and Lulu Wilson play his wife and young daughter) land rather haphazardly in jeopardy. Derricksons ideas eventually run out but ""Deliver Us From Evil"" still delivers far more than expected. 256 MoviesDeliver Us From Evil trailer PLOT A skeptical New York City cop and a Jesuit priest team up to solve a series of crimes. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (violence gore language) CAST Eric Bana Edgar Ramirez Olivia Munn LENGTH 157 BOTTOM LINE A surprisingly strong cast and solid direction make all the malarkey in this horror flick tolerable.

Derrickson gets indulgent with the gore but shows admirable restraint when it comes to supernatural hijinks. Nobody crawls up walls or unhinges his jaw here but theres plenty of ordinary horrific biting and clawing. Unfortunately the story dialogue and characters have some trouble carrying all that spiritual weight; ponderousness ensues. Perhaps sensing this Derrickson piles on the jump scares and makes a couple of ill-advised attempts at fight sequences.

Its pretty much the cinematic epitome of the word.The movie is never boring. The atmosphere is decidedly unsettling and a viewer will jump a few times. Even the acting is fairly solid. Still the overall effect is sort of blah. You wont hate yourself for seeing it but you wont remember it in a week either.MORE MOVIES July Movie Guide | Summer Movie Guide | Summer sequels were looking forward toLoosely inspired by true events (arent most of these movies?) the film centers on hard-boiled cop Ralph Sarchie (Eric Bana). A lapsed Catholic he seems to have a certain radar when it comes to detecting evil which keeps him busy in the Bronx streets. (Side note Its impossible to forget the movie is set in the Bronx because Bana tends to hit the Noo Yawk accent a little too hard. Otherwise hes fine.)Sarchie gets involved in a series of increasingly weird events. A mother disposes of her infant near the lions den at the zoo. An Italian clan reports spooky noises coming from the family basement. Soon Sarchies adorable 6-year-old daughter reports she hears scratching below the floorboards of her bedroom.Things start to come together when Sarchie meets the Rev. Mendoza (Edgar Ramirez from ""Zero Dark Thirty"") a chain-smoking priest with soulful eyes a tight leather jacket and long curly hair. He may look like he wandered over from the set of a music video but hes actually an exorcist who thinks demons may be behind the strange occurrences.Writer-director Scott Derrickson knows his way around a fright flick; hes also behind the superior ""Sinister"" and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" Although everything here works for the most part there is also a definite lack of oomph as the movie pushes toward the inevitable climax. Because an exorcist is prominently featured in the plot its no surprise that the ending features weird lighting oozing substances and shouted prayers. It just doesnt have the kind of punch one expects from this sort of film.Review Deliver Us From Evil 3 starsDirector Scott Derrickson.Cast Eric Bana Edgar Ramirez Joel McHale Olivia Munn.Rating R for violence terror and language.Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

If you jerked in your seat it served its function. Biology requires us to react to jump scares just as it urges a lonely man to thrill to a great set of tits. But triggering a coronary reaction is a cheaper standard than making a quality movie. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Joel McHale pops up as a jockish cop who likes to fight with a knife.Scott Derricksons Deliver Us From Evil is an atmospheric but anemic spook story about a New York policeman named Ralph (Eric Bana) who stumbles across a demon-possessed crime spree which traces back to a battlefield in Diyala. Luckily for Derrickson this devil hates light bulbs causing Ralph to spend countless scenes wandering around in the dark waiting to be startled by a cat. Even when he goes outside he cant catch a break -- cinematographer Scott Kevan shoots this slick and sinister cityscape as if the streets themselves are possessed and on the rare days when it isnt raining the sun is as weak as if Satan himself had drained it like a pimple.Film Details Deliver Us From Evil RatingR GenreSuspense/Thriller Running Time118 min. More Info There are flickers of camp. Comic Joel McHale pops up as a jockish cop who likes to fight with a knife and an entire sequence is shot in night-vision at the zoo. (Lions and devils and bears oh my) One flashback to a mere five years before is so nonsensically grainy that it looks like it was filmed by Zapruder and as Ralphs wife (Olivia Munn) and daughter (Lulu Wilson) become targets we get distracted by wondering why the family owns the last old-school Jack-in-the-box in the Bronx.Yet despite the screaming gore the movie is so rote that it cant even rouse us for the de rigueur exorcism here set in an interrogation room with a random cop observing from behind the glass. His reaction -- a blurted ""Get the fuck out of here"" -- gets a laugh. But when the film remembers to cut back to him minutes later were surprised to see he hasnt already yawned and walked away.DELIVER US FROM EVIL | Directed by Scott Derrickson | Sony Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

In Scott Derricksons latest film (he also directed Sinister and The Exorcism of Emily Rose) we follow tough cynical cop Sarchie (Eric Bana) as a series of increasingly creepy occurrences in the Bronx open his eyes to the fact that demons are real and that he needs to get good with God. Sarchie were told is known for his ""radar"" -- a clairvoyants ability to sense when something is worth looking into. But he himself isnt much of a believer in the supernatural. ""Ive seen horrible things but nothing that cant be explained by human nature"" he tells Jesuit priest Mendoza played by Edgar Ramirez. ""Then you havent seen true evil"" the priest replies. Spoiler alert but true evil turns out to be lurking around the corner. After Sarchie investigates several seemingly unconnected incidents -- including one in which a woman tossed her infant into the lions den at the Bronx Zoo -- he begins to realize that the events might be connected. Father Mendoza then enters the picture and begins to make solemn pronouncements about ""primary evil"" and ""secondary evil"" and playfully shames Sarchie for his abandonment of the church. ""I guess I outgrew all that"" the tough cop reflects. ""You outgrew God?"" Mendoza inquires. Point Jesuit priest. Theres promise in these atmospheric early scenes when Sarchie alongside his partner (a surprisingly buff Joel McHale) and occasionally Mendoza rushes bravely into unlit basements or looks down pitch-black corridors or leaps into a lions den at night. (It certainly helps that whatever sinister power is causing these people to do horrific things also makes the lights go out whenever its near.) There are animals galore lions bears owls fish a screeching cat (of course) a mouse caught in a trap and a big-ass dog that apparently likes to sit quietly in the darkness until juuust the right moment to start barking maniacally. Other typical elements abound including a creepy music box doors that close of their own will and scratching noises under childrens beds. And a de rigueur climactic exorcism that looks like all the other exorcisms. Of course one mans horror cliche is anothers horror tradition and theres nothing necessarily wrong with a movie that relies on reliable scare tactics. (Horror movies are a kind of comfort food after all.) Last years The Conjuring breathed new life into these old tropes by giving us victims we cared about and by focusing as much on suspense as it did on scares. Its characters were afraid of the things they were seeing and their fear was contagious -- it leaped off the screen and contaminated us. Deliver Us From Evil isnt nearly as successful. Oh its dark to be sure -- there are plenty of scenes where you can barely make out whats going on -- but its characters feel more like mouthpieces and plot conveniences and so the fear doesnt grab us. There are some half-decent scares -- mostly of the hey-wait-everything-suddenly-got-really-quiet-and-oh-my-God-whats-THAT jump-shock kind -- but little dread. And after a while the films grim desolate settings come off not so much as a landscape of moral squalor (as in Se7en) but as a tedious attempt to add gravity to a thoroughly generic horror tale. But the films real problem is that its somehow both one-note and convoluted. The plots a tangle of backstory -- its hard at times to keep track of which possessed-looking guy or gal did which awful thing -- but none of it really matters because the focus is not on the indistinct victims but on Sarchie himself. (He does of course have a wife and child and they do of course get involved but its done in an almost offensively haphazard box-checking way.) Yet even he feels like a device. Bana is a likable actor but he doesnt bring any vulnerability or transparency to the part; its hard to tell what hes thinking if hes thinking anything at all. And so we move from one bleak bludgeoning setpiece to another. But with each loud noise the film loses us more and more.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Jul. 01 2014 1019AM EDT Last updated Tuesday Jul. 01 2014 1029AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Scott Derrickson Written by Scott Derrickson Paul Harris Boardman Starring Eric Bana Edgar Ramirez Sean Harris Joel McHale Classification 14A Genre horror Year 2014 Country USA Language English Allowing that the best way to thwart the forces of evil in the universe is to laugh in their face Deliver Us From Evil is a big fat slam dunk on the side of good. If this movie doesnt leave you howling at the very idea of demonic possession youre in dire need of an exorcist.Mind-blowingly asserting its based on actual events this profoundly preposterous cop-horror mash-up movie posits not only that demons took possession of three Iraq war vets who poked into the wrong hole while pursuing insurgents in 2010 but that when they returned to New York they unleashed a surge in demonic hoodoo that got the animals riled in the Bronx Zoo the toys in a little girls bedroom all Chucky-ed up and a piece chomped out of Eric Banas arm by a mental patient who previously lobbed her baby into the aforementioned civic tourist attractions lions den. Before getting that chunk chewed from his arm Banas hard-core non-believing New Yawk flatfoot Ralph Sarchie thought evil was merely what men do and the movie opens with an incident of random infanticide which gruesomely backs him up. But as the weirdness ramps up and Sarchie is confronted by all manner of spooky basements shock-cut visions crazed aquarium fish random bursts of Doors music and a Hispanic maverick priest-demonologist (Edgar Ramirez) in a leather jacket he slowly comes around to what the film has already been insisting with all the poetic subtlety of a rabid ferret dropped in ones trousers this stuff is real bro Wake up and smell the sulphur As the stalwartly demon-resistant Sarchie the grimly humourless and persistently charisma-short Bana has little to do but provide an inadvertent explanation for the question of why all this demonic chaos keeps breaking out in his general vicinity. In one of his many interminable expositional sequences - delivered not helpfully in a thick Spanish accent - Ramirez suggests theres something inside the big guy the devil cant resist. And there is a vacuum just begging for something anything to fill it.But if Deliver Us From Evil is a bad movie it at least has the decency to be a full-on bull-moose howler of a bad movie which is to say its fun to watch in an entirely unwholesome slow-motion-into-brick-wall kind of way. So if you are looking for something devilishly awful to watch and have the disposable scratch to invest in few hours of dubiously negative amusement this might be your cup of upchuck.

Bana plays a a retired beat cop and demon chaser.  (Andrew Schwartz / SONY PICTURES)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. July 2 2014Deliver Us From EvilStarring Eric Bana Edgar Ramirez Joel McHale Chris Coy and Olivia Munn. Directed by Scott Derrickson. At GTA theatres. 119 minutes. 14ABe very afraid when you see ""inspired by"" flash on the screen at the start of Deliver Us From Evil a not-so-scary supernatural horror movie set in Noo Yawk da Bronx to be exact.""Inspired by"" is dodgier than the usual ""based on"" which itself is no guarantee of fidelity. The subject in question is the real-life career of NYPD Sgt. Ralph Sarchie a retired beat cop and demon chaser who figured Ol Nick was ""a different kind of perpetrator ... but a perpetrator nonetheless.""Article Continued BelowIf we actually had more of the sergeants spark from Eric Bana who plays Sarchie in the film then Deliver Us From Evil might not have been DOA. A flatfoot trying to collar Beelzebub in da Bronxs toughest precinct isnt so terrible an idea when you consider the regular devils a copper there must deal with day in and day out. Alas the movie is just another dumb riff on The Exorcist which like that vastly superior film begins in Iraq and then finds ""primary evil"" at work in America requiring believers and non-believers alike to get out the holy water crosses and mystical oaths. Possessed and post-trauma stressed Marines returned from Iraq conflict are the devils playthings this time out along with a few hapless innocent bystanders.This also means its time for writer/director Scott Derrickson to reach into his usual bag of tricks seen previously in Sinister and The Exorcism of Emily Rose and indeed all films of this ilk supernatural baddies zombified human proxies threatened tots and constant jump scares.Dont forget that favourite horror cliche the light bulb or flashlight that suddenly goes out because ""the Prince of Darkness"" is present. This makes for an especially dim movie because da beast is in da house so often.All of which amounts to a lost opportunity because Deliver Us From Evil has talent to spare at least on the male side of the ledger (Olivia Munn and Lulu Wilson barely register as Sarchies annoyed and/or terrified wife and daughter).Aussie actor Banas Bronx accent might be a tad suspect but hes got the chiseled machismo needed for a cop brave enough to take on any beast no matter whether its of the satanic or jungle variety. Hes also boneheaded enough to walk straight into the lions den at the Bronx Zoo -- which natch is in the midst of a power failure.Hes got a fine sidekick named Butler played with buoyant banter by Joel McHale (TVs Community) who plays with switchblades in a manner that would have most people calling the cops if he wasnt already one himself. He tears up the screen but we dont see enough of him.The testosterone teaming goes straight to hell with the priest character played by Edgar Ramirez (Carlos) a chain-smoking and whiskey-guzzling padre who seems to be channelling Serpico-era Al Pacino.For much of the movie Ramirezs Fr. Mendoza stands around nattering about ""true evil"" which manifests itself in da Bronx as tattooed frothing and biting zombies led by Chris Coys demonized Marine. Theyre motivated by strange hieroglyphics that Sarchie takes forever to figure out despite possessing ""radar"" that allows him to see devil people. Its a chequebook gig for Ramirez but it could have been so much more -- there are interesting parallels in the wartime horrors witnessed in Iraq by the Marines and the street savagery Bronx cops deal with daily. Derrickson and co-writer Paul Harris Boardman (the two also teamed for The Exorcism of Emily Rose) dont pursue anything deeper than the usual supernatural shtick. They dont even bother with a current soundtrack. The film features several ancient hits by The Doors perhaps a nod to producer Jerry Bruckheimer a music-loving Baby Boomer. But at least we get a good laugh out of the devilish Doors connection in an exchange between the grim Sarchie and the smartass Butler.A possessed women starts muttering the lyrics to ""Break On Through (To The Other Side).""""It must be drugs"" Sarchie observes.""What if shes just a big fan?"" Butler retorts.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Andrew Schwartz/Screen Gems MOVIE REVIEW Deliver Us From Evil Above average exorcise. Running time 118 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence gore terror). At the Empire and the Union Square. (Very) loosely inspired by the memoir of an NYPD detective who worked with exorcists ""Deliver Us From Evil expertly serves shivers buckets of gore -- and pretty much every cliche of the genre. Its also got a solid lead performance by the intense Croatian-Australian actor Eric Bana (""Lone Survivor) who treats the sometimes risible occurrences with deadly seriousness while still maintaining a sense of gallows humor. Banas refusal to treat this as camp or slumming is a good part of why this hard-R supernatural thriller is a definite guilty pleasure for those so inclined. New York cop Ralph Sarchies exploits -- he claims to have participated in more than 20 exorcisms -- made the front page of The Post in 1999 and his memoir was published two years later. That hasnt stopped director and co-writer Scott Derrickson (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose) from moving the story forward to the very different Bronx of 2013 where Sarchie investigates increasingly weird incidents involving a trio of Iraq war veterans. Unlike his devoutly religious real-life counterpart Banas Sarchie is a lapsed Catholic with a very dark secret that a priest (Edgar Ramirez whose excellent work matches Banas) with his own dark secret says gives Sarchie a unique insight into fighting evil. Lord knows theres plenty of evil to be combated here -- including a possessed woman who tosses her infant son into a moat in front of the tiger enclosure at the Bronx Zoo and later takes a bite out of our heros arm when he is unwise enough to stick his cellphone into her hospital cell. Oh and then theres the possessed veteran who kidnaps Sarchies wife (Olivia Munn) and young daughter who he has been neglecting. Derrickson who maintains interest for a solid two hours hasnt missed a single trope flickering lights weird sounds and voices scary dolls suicides landing on car hoods the sinister jack-in-the-box that slows down then speeds up its delivery of ""Pop Goes the Weasel. The fight to the death atop an old player piano may be a new touch though. Joel McHale of TVs ""Community provides some comic relief as Sarchies more laid-back partner who is still willing to go along with his crazier hunches. But the real chemistry is between Bana and Ramirez -- you wont nap during their climatic exorcism at a station house thats for sure. Sarchie told The Posts Douglas Montero back in 1999 that hes a fan of horror films from way back. I dont think hes disappointed with ""Deliver Us From Evil and neither will be other horror aficionados.

Daily Edition Login to download Deliver Us From Evil Film Review 457 PM PDT 7/1/2014 by John Defore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS An effective if imperfect meeting of the detective film and the exorcism-based fright flick. TWITTER Scott Derrickson makes his second ""based on a true story"" exorcism tale. A serial-killer mystery in which the culprit turns out to be one of Satans minions Scott Derricksons Deliver Us From Evil adapts the detective genre to an exorcism tale that is very serious about the prospect of demonic possession. Though based on claims made by real-life NYPD officer-turned-paranormal investigator Ralph Sarchie (played here by Eric Bana) the picture is stolen by a fictional character -- a composite religious figure played with a predictable level of smolder by Carlos star Edgar Ramirez. More aesthetically coherent if less frightening than the directors 2012 hit Sinister the pic has a shot at surpassing that outing commercially by virtue of its appeal to devout Catholics. That audience will find Deliver very respectful of their faith though its nods to religion are genre-appropriate and never preachy enough to alienate the average horror fan. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies X-Men Days of Future Past Mockingjay Sarchie a cop who covers the South Bronx with partner Butler (Joel McHale) is proud of an internal ""radar"" that steers him away from mundane radio calls and toward the juicy cases. But an incident in which a deranged mother threw her toddler into the Bronx Zoos lion pit is juicier than usual with a mysterious blood-stained bystander disrupting the investigation before vanishing. Still Sarchie is ready to write the mother off as a garden-variety psycho even when a Jesuit priest Ramirezs Mendoza shows up to insist on a more complicated explanation. Only after other crimes prove to share both tangible connections (tracing to three Marines who had a disturbing encounter during the Iraq war) and supernatural overtones does Sarchie admit there may be something to this chain-smoking whiskey-drinking priests claim. Maybe the lapsed-Catholic cop starts to worry the man theyre hunting really is possessed. Enjoyably this particular case isnt limited to one spirit-controlled victim terrorizing his family and friends. Poltergeist-y aftereffects haunt the places and people he has visited -- even Sarchie who is plagued by shock-cut hallucinations and whose house has become a very scary place for his young daughter. (Olivia Munn playing Sarchies wife tries to comfort the poor girl but the film ratchets up her bump-in-the-night torment.) LIST The Hollywood Reporter Reveals Hollywoods 100 Favorite Films The investigation yields some appreciably icky encounters with putrefying corpses and deranged prisoners which is good considering the sometimes-flimsy cop-movie stuff that surrounds the scares. Bulked-up McHale who acquits himself well in action scenes gets the kind of jadedly quippy dialogue one can easily imagine him parodying on Community; Munns part could have been scripted by cut-and-pasting any of a hundred other neglected-policemans-wife characters. While the supernatural side of the film suffers a flaw or two -- continued references to The Doors are superfluous and sometimes chuckle-inducing -- its central conflict works. Ramirez shaggy enough to be the Serpico of exorcists but exuding calm wisdom instead of obsessive determination makes faith look cool. His seriousness enables the movies desire to dig into the mechanics of the climactic exorcism -- though Sean Harris drooling and growling and threatening as the possessed man deserves credit as well. Derricksons FX crew careens along the dividing line between excitement and silly bombast conjuring hurricane-like forces and gory transformations while the holy man attempts to rescue an innocent mortal from his otherworldly tormentors.

Its possible that the very quality that attracts so many horror directors to tales of demonic possession is exactly what makes so many of them ultimately unsatisfying Every conflict and every resolution can always be written off by resorting to literal deus or diabolus ex machina. Think up a creepy supernatural setpiece with no narrative explanation? ""The devil did it"" bails you out every time. Write your protagonist into an impossible corner with no reasonable chance of escape? A crucifix or a vial of holy water will do the trick just fine. Relying heavily on this particular crutch as well as plenty of jump scares and a solid cast Scott Derricksons supernatural horror-policier ""Deliver Us From Evil"" is a professionally assembled genre mashup thats too silly to be scary and a bit too dull to be a midnight-movie guilty pleasure. It should nonetheless cull decent business on Fourth of July weekend. ""Deliver Us From Evil"" is being marketed with the enormous above-the-fold tagline ""inspired by the actual accounts of an NYPD sergeant."" The sergeant in question is Ralph Sarchie -- also the name of the films protagonist -- who spent years as both an NYPD officer and an occult investigator and later wrote a book about his experiences. Still the description seems to stretch the ""based on a true story"" credulity limits about as far as they can go. Technically a film ""based on the actual accounts of Lance Armstrong"" could omit all mention of steroid use. And a film ""inspired by the actual accounts of Lance Armstrong"" could theoretically see him partner up with a talking moose to fight crime just so long as the inspiration was there. There are no talking animals in ""Deliver Us From Evil"" -- though strange zoological behavior does factor repeatedly into the story -- and the proceedings begin on a rather grounded note. Eric Bana stars as Sarchie a tough-as-nails plainclothes cop with an almost clairvoyant radar for criminal activity and a wife (Olivia Munn) and daughter (Lulu Wilson) whom hes increasingly been neglecting in pursuit of Gothams worst. Hes partnered with an ""adrenaline junkie"" officer named Butler (Joel McHale) the type of roughneck who wears a Red Sox hat on duty just to stir up trouble and prefers to fight perps with a combat knife despite the perfectly good service revolver on his hip. Patrolling a peculiar microclimate of the South Bronx with nearly nonstop rain and few visible minorities the two partners investigate a series of rather rough crimes. First a domestic-violence call leads to a chase after a crazed Iraq War vet (Scott Johnsen). Soon after the two apprehend a deranged woman (Olivia Horton all violent twitches and mumbled Doors lyrics) who threw her baby into the lion cage at the Bronx Zoo leading to a showdown with a few lions themselves. And lastly an Italian immigrant family reports strange noises coming from their basement which leads to a gruesome discovery. The final incident prompts them to investigate a sinister connection between three former soldiers in the Middle East who were previously seen investigating a mysterious cave in the pics prelude. While the films opening run falls squarely into police procedural territory Sarchie begins to notice odd goings-on (strange hallucinations and noises that only he can detect mysterious Latin inscriptions barroom jukeboxes still playing the Doors in 2014) and before long he runs across hard-drinking chain-smoking bedroom-eyed Catholic priest Joe Mendoza (Edgar Ramirez) who dresses in street clothes and disappoints the eager women at the bars he frequents. From here the film starts running through rather standard demonic horror paces with one foot still in the precinct as Mendoza very gradually starts to convince the lapsed-Catholic Sarchie that these cases cant be solved through criminology alone. But whatever traces of distinctiveness the film had previously shown start to melt away as it trudges toward its finale. Its hardly a spoiler to note that ""Deliver Us From Evil"" leads up to a long exorcism scene though its disappointing to see it come and go without adding anything novel to the long tradition of exorcism scenes. Derrickson who helmed the well-regarded ""Sinister"" and ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is a thoroughly accomplished orchestrator of jolts and goosebumps utilizing quasi-found-footage techniques p.o.v. shots and disquieting overhead angles to good effect. What hes unable to do here however is string these jump scares together to create any sense of overwhelming dread. Its perhaps appropriate that the films most legitimately frightening individual scene involving Sarchies daughter and her collection of creepy toys seems to come from a different film entirely. While Derrickson is astute with the horror tropes the police-procedural elements demonstrate a weird sort of narrative nonchalance. In one scene midway through for example Sarchie shows up alone at a womans apartment to investigate some strange video files on her computer. Suddenly the lights start flickering on and off and Sarchie is viciously attacked by a demonically possessed man who promptly flings himself through a second-floor window. The next scene shows Sarchie calmly back at the womans computer. Did the woman notice the commotion in her apartment? Did Sarchie call for backup? Was he hurt? Did he at least help fix the window? Buried down just below the films surface are a number of interesting ideas such as a conversation between Sarchie and Mendoza contrasting primary and secondary evil and the implicit conflation of demonic possession with post-traumatic stress disorder but theyre rarely given much room to breathe. As for the stars Bana seems fully committed to the character though his New York accent varies wildly and Ramirez walks a fine line between low-key naturalism and sleepiness.

Reply Hairy Arse says July 2 2014 at 731 am Ive read so many of these lame-ass horror scripts... you always have a prologue featuring a US MARINE in the Middle East encountering some force or other; then three pages later hes back in the US pushing a pram through Central Park (or such place.) Theyre so stupid - dumb as this movie. Reply TONY says July 2 2014 at 532 am Think up a creepy supernatural setpiece with no narrative explanation? ""The devil did it"" bails you out every time. Write your protagonist into an impossible corner with no reasonable chance of escape? A crucifix or a vial of holy water will do the trick just fine. Uh...well heres the math Horror+Evil=devil so... crucifix+Holy water=God(solution) Any director who will do a film like this has something very similar to the material hes directing in his spirit. He has evil in him some where. Reply GKN says July 2 2014 at 1257 am What is with the trend in showing young mothers dispose of their babies in appalling ways? I just saw ""The Homesman"" and now read the the above. And yes I did see ""Trainspotting"" at the time which was pretty awful too but at least involuntary. Does no one give a thought any more at all to the effect of such scenes on this monkey-see monkey do so-called human race we live in? Despite all the evidence HW producers are well aware of despite the hypocritical cant of most. At least Kubrick had the moral decency to withdraw Clockwork Orange when it spawned a host a host of imitators. Reply DELIVER US FROM EVIL looks lame says July 2 2014 at 1023 am Well perhaps you should go back in time in a time machine to the 1930s 40s and 50s when restrictive Production Codes made Hollywood movies much more safe and sanitized...and unrealistic.. Your complaint ""monkey-see monkey-do"" has been levelled at Hollywood since the Silent Era Reply GKN says July 2 2014 at 459 pm Actually maybe you should go back. (And you wont need a time-machine btw. Just a computer or DVD player...) A great many films from the 40s especially even the 60s (the 50s less so) were more realistic and handled subjects they wouldnt dare today - say for example The Scopes Monkey Trial in Inherit the Wind. Execs would be terrfied to touch anything like that today much as they should. They just didnt go for facile shock-value as much at the time. TONY says July 2 2014 at 527 am Yes.

A Bronx cop faces a case of demonic possession. Director Scott Derrickson (158). R Gore violence language. Area theaters Say this about modern exorcism movies You usually know just what youre gonna get. And when it comes to the cliches of demonic possession director Scott Derrickson -- who also made ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" -- delivers. In fact he gives us two full hours of sinister voices speaking Latin weird phrases written in blood on the wall and screechy violins on the soundtrack. Its all so familiar its like the horror-movie equivalent of comfort food. Derrickson opens with a promise that ""Deliver Us From Evil"" was inspired by the ""actual accounts"" of Bronx police officer A former altar boy turned professional cynic Sgt. Sarchie (Eric Bana) has a natural radar for trouble. One dark night it leads him straight into the path of possessed Iraq War veteran Santino (Sean Harris). Other members of Santinos unit have recently gone crazy a coincidence Sarchie initially writes off as drug-related. But when he starts hearing voices and his wife (Olivia Munn wasted) and daughter (Lulu Wilson adorable) complain of scrabbling under the floorboards he gets suspicious. And thats where Father Mendoza (Edgar Ramirez) steps in. Bana trudges through the movie dutifully though he cant quite sell his New Yawk attitude. Far more interesting is Ramirez (""Carlos the Jackal"") a terrific actor who deserves better work. As is he elevates the movie by charismatic force adding crucial shades to the stock role of a renegade religious advisor. If this guy tried to sell you wild supernatural theories as scientific fact youd buy them too. Eric Bana (left) and Edgar Ramirez (SMPSP) Bronx cop/psychic Ralph Sarchie (Bana) at a vulnerable moment (SMPSP) Actually Ramirez should probably have been cast in the lead since things flatten out whenever he disappears. Derrickson does try to create believable atmosphere and theres a promising early scene in a surprisingly creepy Bronx Zoo. But then he loses steam filling his overlong movie with a parade of swarming flies thumping furniture and enough thunderstorms to break every deli umbrella in New York. By the time we get to the actual exorcism its not the possession but the predictability thatll make your head spin. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Hell deliver-bana-screen-gems.jpg Eric Bana uncovers a creepy conspiracy in Deliver Us From Evil (SCREEN GEMS) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 02 2014 at 100 AM comments ""Deliver Us From Evil"" is a pretty gruesome horror movie that only wants to scare you. Me it made nostalgic. Part of that longing was for an old scary-movie tradition that relied less on teenagers and shaky ""found footage"" than on creepy apartments and ancient curses (both of which get a workout here). And some was for the ugly New York of the urban horror movies finest era -- a `70s city full of smudged graffiti bizarre neighbors and marauding cockroaches. I know. Its a sickness. But whether you embrace or rue the shiny chain-store city that now exists ""Deliver Us From Evil"" -- even though nominally set in the present -- will bring you right back to a slummy scummy New York you may have forgotten. Also back to some of the movies -- from ""The Possession of Joel Delaney"" to ""The Sentinel"" -- that time gave rise to. Basically this is yet another exorcism story. Cultural critics might explain that new movie trend as a return to faith amidst uncertain times; marketing majors will simply point out that recent Hollywood demographics reveal that Latinos most of whom are Catholic comprise a huge part of the horror audience. And this movie combines both influences by having as its main characters a tough Catholic cop (whos lost his faith) and a sinning Latin-American priest who team up when a series of strange and strangely related violent crimes erupt across the Bronx. The demonic evil they uncover eventually leads back to a mysterious temple in Iraq -- and jumps forward to an exorcism complete with the Roman Ritual foul bodily fluids some spine-jarring contortions and a lot of foul-mouthed personal taunting. Its all cliched of course and has been since ""The Exorcist"" -- why does every possessed person have to sound like Mercedes McCambridge? -- but its still effective perhaps more so with anyone who like our hero cop comes from the world of scented smoke and altar boys. Australias Eric Bana whos always projected a sort of wounded incomprehension -- hes like a nicer version of Russell Crowe -- is fine as the cop even if he overdoes the Noo Yawk accent at times. Edgar Ramirez is acceptable as the flawed priest while Olivia Munn gets the thankless role of worried wife. But the movies mythology doesnt quite make sense -- its all evil for the sake of evil with a lot of grisly acts that do the Devil no good. And the actual demon-summoning -- which requires the acolytes to constantly construct elaborate signage -- seems silly. Worse though is the introductory title as in most of these movies assuring us that this was based on ""a real story."" Oh really? Its based on a book marketed as non-fiction true written by an ex-cop turned demonologist. Still little here (beginning with our hero beating a man to death on the street and never even being investigated) seems to have any basis in plausibility let alone reality. Director Scott Derickson -- who did the grisly little ""Sinister"" -- once again makes good use of the films sound design to plant little shocks. Bana is fine and there are more than a few images -- including one of a loathsome bit of animal abuse -- that truly unnerve. But the scariest thing in the movie may be that it made me wish a little for the days of Magic-Markered subways -- not to mention cheap horror films that saved by skimping on the budget rather than their imagination.

But its also disarmingly classy almost respectable.First the fine casting.Derrickson - whose last demonological creepfest the fun but also forgettable class act Sinister starred Ethan Hawke and James Ransone - here is blessed with a roster of top talent led by Eric Bana ( Munich) as police sergeant-turned-demonologist Ralph Sarchie Olivia Munn ( Newsroom) as his wife and Adgar RamArez ( Carlos) as his spiritual adviser. We even get comic Joel McHale (Es The Soup Community) as Sarchies wisecracking partner Butler.To top things off the demonically possessed killer hunted by Sarchie is played by Sean Harris who transfixed viewers as the cold-blooded assassin Micheletto in The Borgias.Deliver Us From Evil is marketed as a true story It is loosely based on the 2001 memoir of the real-life Ralph Sarchie a former cop who with the guidance of a Jesuit priest and exorcism expert came to believe in the existence of demons.RamArez is really - really - earnest and awfully serious in the role of the priest a former heroin addict who helps Sarchie see the light. Or in this case the dark.Both are hard-drinkin macho men so it seems natural theyd team up to track down capture and exorcise the demon.Munn is totally wasted in a stock role as the absurdly patient wife who stands by her man as he goes off demon- hunting.Deliver Us From Evil moves at a brisk pace thanks to Derricksons efficient - if demonically formulaic - script.Going to this movie is a lot like buying a fast-food burger. You know exactly whats in it how its prepared how much it costs and what itll taste like. Though to be fair this isnt a 3.79 Quarter Pounder with cheese. Its a classy 12.95 steak sandwich.But drown them both in lots of blood-red ketchup and they pretty much taste the same. Deliver Us From Evil  (out of four stars) Directed by Scott Derrickson. With Eric Bana Adgar RamArez Olivia Munn Joel McHale Sean Harris.

(Andrew Schwartz/Screen Gems/ SONY) By Michael OSullivan July 1 2014 The question at the heart of ""Deliver Us From Evil"" a garden-variety serial-killer thriller tarted up as an exorcism drama is not whether good will triumph over evil. Rather its this What in Gods name possesses good actors to make dreck like this? Eric Bana I cast thee out in the name of SAG and AFTRA. The normally respectable actor plays Ralph Sarchie a New York police officer investigating a series of crimes that turn out to have a paranormal link. Bana almost holds his own despite having to refer to the belief in demonic possession as ""blaming evil fairies for the bad [expletive] people do."" And with lines like that were supposed to be scared? Most of the frights in the early part of the film come not from satanic forces but from animals jumping out from behind things. For a good hour I thought I was watching a ""My Cat From Hell"" marathon on Animal Planet. Eric Bana in ""Deliver Us from Evil."" (Andrew Schwartz/Screen Gems/ SONY) Banas not the only talented if misguided soul here either. Edgar Ramirez is wasted as a sexy Jesuit exorcist with a troubled past. And as Sarchies partner funnyman Joel McHale is ill-equipped to quip his way out of the films far-fetched premise despite yukking it up at every opportunity. Ramirez at least brings a bit of class to the film delivering in his buttery Venezuelan accent the films only heft (in the form of some speechifying about how we gain strength by admitting to our spiritual weaknesses). Director and co-writer Scott Derrickson (""Sinister"") tries way too hard to crank up the tension setting the entire film in what looks like monsoon season in the Bronx and ensuring that no scene is lit by more than a police-issue Maglite. But I mostly blame producer Jerry Bruckheimer who seems to think hes making an R-rated version of a ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie ratcheting up his signature mix of supernatural hoo-ha and comedy with a boatload of grisly violence and gore. True to form its a loud and hysterical effort where quiet and creepy would have better served the material. Speaking of material the film is said to be based on the case files of a real-life cop-turned-demonologist. Instead it seems to have been inspired by a stack of rejected horror-movie scripts found in a studio dumpster. Deliver Us From Evil  1/2 (118 minutes at area theaters) Rated R for bloody violence grisly images terror throughout and coarse language. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The hokey and derivative exorcism thriller Deliver Us From Evil commences with one of those opening boasts of veracity designed to send preemptive chills down the spines of the superstitious and the gullible. This time the disclaimer seems less a hook than a defense mechanism Complain that the film resembles dozens of other likeminded scare-fests and those involved might refer you to the ""true stories"" that ""inspired"" it. Said stories were pulled from the pages of Beware The Night a 2001 memoir by Ralph Sarchie who transitioned from fighting ""secondary evil"" as an NYPD detective to helping combat ""primary evil"" as a demonologist. Either Sarchies real-life experiences conformed to the hoariest horror conventions or the creative time behind Deliver Us From Evil has taken a loose liberal approach to adapting them. The fact that the movie is set in 2013--more than a dozen years after the last of the books events supposedly occurred--gives one a good idea of how important fidelity was to the producers.Of course as last summers similarly ""fact-based"" The Conjuring proved its not necessary to believe a supernatural anecdote to be spooked by it. The real issue is that Deliver Us From Evil doesnt even believe in its tropes whose moldiness no veneer of ""authenticity"" can mask. The movie combines elements from both the exorcism and policier genres meaning that the usual supernatural scare tactics--creepy Latin incantations possessed toys manipulated voices--now come with a side of buddy-cop banter. Eric Bana sporting a glazed stare and shaky Bronx accent plays Sarchie a lawman haunted by the sickening crimes he investigates. Hes got a family he neglects (""Even when youre here youre not here"" complains wife Olivia Munn) and a traumatic backstory to which he cryptically alludes. He also has a switchblade-twirling hothead partner played by Joel McHale spouting quips that could have been pulled from a Community parody of cop movies.Sarchie and his partner spend most of Deliver Us From Evil poking around in fetid vermin-infested apartment complexes their flashlight beams illuminating ominously scrawled messages and sacrificed house pets. Gradually a mystery comes together--one involving veterans of the war in Iraq a woman who throws her child into the lions pen at the Bronx Zoo a hooded painter and the repeated appearance of Jim Morrison lyrics. Helping Sarchie sort the mumbo from the jumbo is Mendoza (Edgar Ramirez) a Catholic priest who specializes in the paranormal. A recovering drug addict who drinks like a fish smokes like a chimney and eyeballs the women he cant date Mendoza is a complete invention of the screenwriters and it shows. His first function is as an exposition machine on hand to debrief the characters (and audience) on all unholy matters. His second function is as another mismatched partner for Sarchie the Mulder to his Scully. Ramirez tackles the role with the paycheck-cashing boredom it deserves. Deliver Us From Evil flirts with an interesting subtext briefly suggesting that trauma is the real malevolent spirit that possesses people--especially cops and soldiers who witness atrocities they cant un-witness; the darkness of their work creeping inside of them. But the film turns out to be more concerned with generic concepts of good versus evil the usual Biblical battle these movies reenact one demonic expulsion at a time. In truth the familiarity of the material wouldnt matter so much if any of it was staged with panache. Scott Derrickson who made the infinitely scarier and more accomplished Sinister seems to have lost his feel for the genre. He drenches just about every scene in an ugly inky darkness. Far from giving the movie a menacing atmosphere these sprawling shadows simply obscure spaces beyond recognition. The action scenes are clumsily filmed and choppily edited; one botched sequence involving Sarchies dangerous encounter with a jungle cat fails to even convincingly place Bana and the animal in the same frame together. Inevitably the film reaches the exorcism portion of the evening and its so by the book--the splitting flesh the shattering windows the guttural threats--that even the most deeply devout of viewers may find their minds wandering to earlier better versions of the scene theyre watching. Deliver us from such cliches Hollywood.

Posted July 9 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Somewhere buried deep beneath the murky photography lazy mirror gags sound-based jump scares and deeply unnecessary cruelty to cats that make up the bulk of the dire Deliver Us From Evil is a not-uninteresting story about an on-the-edge cop hunting down a group of PTSD-suffering former soldiers. Not to say that movie would be any good but it would certainly be better than this rote exorcism-is-real claptrap. The movie opens with a note that it is based on the actual experiences of New York City police sergeant Ralph Sarchie though in trying to ground the film in reality it only makes itself look more ridiculous. Sarchie (played by Eric Bana an Australian with a cartoonish Noo Yawk accent here) navigates the perpetually rain-soaked Bronx following the connection between a series of seemingly unrelated crimes that all circle back to a dishonorably discharged Iraq War vet named Santino (Sean Harris). With the help of his partner (Joel McHale surprisingly not distracting) and a sexy Jesuit priest named Mendoza (Carlos star Edgar Ramirez who really deserves better) Sarchie must decipher whether Santino is possessed by a demon or merely thinks he is. The procedural portions of Deliver while no more complicated than an episode of Law amp; Order SVU do build reasonable levels of tension only to deflate every time Mendoza shows up to batter back evil with a handful of Hail Marys. Thats a fundamental problem with most exorcism stories they lack drama because they all have to make the argument that absolute evil exists which makes the solution to that problem divine intervention or bust. So Deliver devolves into a predictable overlong waiting game. Whats worse it wants to convince you that its a thoughtful meditation on faith but the only thought I had was after noticing McHales character has the seven deadly sins tattooed on the back of his neck ""Man I should have just stayed in and watched Se7en."" You should do the same.

Credit Andrew Schwartz/Screen Gems DELIVER US FROM EVILOpens on Wednesday.Directed by Scott Derrickson1 hour 58 minutesYou know an exorcism is coming in the cop/horror film ""Deliver Us From Evil"" and you perhaps expect it to be a silly disappointment as exorcism scenes so often are. But Scott Derrickson the director and his special-effects crew really deliver the creepy goods here providing an apt climax for as taut and credible a movie involving demonic possession as youre likely to see.The film is inspired by the book ""Beware the Night"" by Ralph Sarchie and Lisa Collier Cool. Mr. Sarchie has the unusual credential combination of retired New York City police officer and demonologist and Eric Bana plays him with a working-class grit well suited to the Bronx where as an officer he stumbled onto a case that led him into occult depravity.Edgar Ramirez plays the priest who gradually leads him to see that the people he is encountering at unsettling crime scenes are not merely garden-variety crazies. Sarchies domestic tribulations -- Olivia Munn plays his wife -- are boilerplate and a few horror movie tropes like a screeching cat turn up but for the most part Mr. Derrickson and the cast keep things fresh and scary. A nighttime scene at the Bronx Zoo will certainly persuade you never to be caught there after dark. And if you had any doubts that the music of the Doors is a direct conduit to Satan theyll be dispelled here.""Deliver Us From Evil"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) because it has gore and cursing and is disturbing as you might say hell.

"Review Deliver Us From Evil thrills with Eric Banas haunted cop - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Deliver Us From Evil thrills with Eric Banas haunted cop ""Deliver Us From Evil"" Andrew Schwartz / Screen Gems Eric Bana stars in ""Deliver Us From Evil."" Eric Bana stars in ""Deliver Us From Evil."" (Andrew Schwartz / Screen Gems) Gary Goldstein Deliver Us From Evil has a climactic sequence worth the price of admission Buckle up for the ride that is ""Deliver Us From Evil"" a highly intense and effective mash-up of police procedural and horror show. Boosting the storys thrill quotient is its air of authenticity The film was inspired by actual paranormal cases described by former New York Police officer Ralph Sarchie in a 2001 book he co-wrote with Lisa Collier Cool.Director Scott Derrickson who adapted the script with frequent collaborator Paul Harris Boardman (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" ""Devils Knot"" ""Urban Legends Final Cut"") has infused this winding tale with propulsive urgency and snowballing tension providing plenty of jumps nightmarish imagery (cat lovers you are warned) and things that literally go bump in the night. In lesser hands the movie might have seemed silly or cliched -- and for some it still may -- between its believe-it-or-not devil-doings and patchwork of dueling-genre tropes. But Derrickson (""Sinister"" ""Emily Rose"") with superb assists from lead actor Eric Bana (as solid as they come) cinematographer Scott Kevan and three-time Oscar-winning sound designer Paul N.J. Ottosson has crafted an absorbing at times riveting spookfest.Bana sporting a credible New Yawk accent and great-fitting T-shirts plays Sarchie a tough if haunted South Bronx-area cop with a self-described ""heavy hand."" Along with his adrenaline-junkie partner (a buff and tatted Joel McHale) Sarchie begins investigating a string of bizarre events which include unhinged mother Jane (Olivia Horton) chucking her child into the lions den at the Bronx Zoo and the gruesome death of a mysterious house painter. Father Joe Mendoza (Edgar Ramirez) an offbeat Jesuit priest with a dark past and ties to the feral Jane tries to convince a skeptical Sarchie that demonic possession is fueling these mounting occurrences. Policeman and padre join up to battle what Mendoza deems ""primary evil"" a pure destructive force of infinite power. Photos Summer Movie Sneaks 2014 Ancient Latin writing and strange symbols questions of faith a chilling and inventive use of music by the Doors and most frightening a veteran (Sean Harris) of the Iraq war whos morphed into an inhuman portal for said primary evil all factor in. Sarchies pregnant wife (Olivia Munn) and 6-year-old daughter (Lulu Wilson) also become enmeshed in the horror. Deliver Us From Evil trailer The trailer for ""Deliver Us From Evil.""

Bereft of chills but flush with cliches Evil is an odd hybrid of slasher and exorcism flick perhaps for those who have seen neither. But even horror neophytes wont be spooked by a film that looks as if it were shot with a smartphone and an Itty Bitty Booklight.STORY Deliver Us From Evil inspired by cop demonologistMORE Joel McHale plays with knives in Deliver Us from EvilREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs guide to summer moviesBased on a book by Ralph Sarchie a former New York City police officer who became an investigator of demonology Evil follows Sarchie (Eric Bana) as he ghost-busts the creepy goings-on in the Bronx.Evil starts promisingly enough as three soldiers discover cave ruins in Iraq during deployment. The opening is a nice break for the genre and offers fleeting hope of something unique. Alas the soldiers while taping their exploits stumble upon indecipherable words etched on a wall that haunt them even when they return to the USA. Perhaps it was the script.Fast-forward three years to a rainy New York where Sarchie and his wisecracking buddy-cop sidekick Butler (Joel McHale) investigate creaking doors and weird floor scratches.Sarchie soon discovers that the soldiers have been demonically possessed kicking off a Bronx crime wave that involves a lot of dead animals derelicts who speak in tongues and for some reason Doors music that only a few can hear. Demons apparently are picky in their playlists.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare New York police officer Ralph Sarchie thinks he has seen all types of evil while on the job. That all begins to change when his daughter is visited by paranormal forces. VPCDirector Scott Derrickson (Sinister) cant seem to decide whether to make a police procedural or ""gotcha"" horror film and winds up with a Frankensteinian mosh of convention the cops always travel solo dont record any freakish behavior and once follow a suspect into the lions den of the Bronx Zoo where power conveniently has gone out. Spoiler alert Lions dont like having naps interrupted.Theres no taking one in Evil thanks to the shrill screams that ring out with every jump cut. And why do families in horror movies never move from a home quartering murderous demons?If theres a highlight to Evil its McHale who makes a surprisingly good cop. But his sarcastic quirks -- Why doesnt anyone turn on a light? Why are you investigating without backup? -- serve as both funny aside and valid critique.To Evilscredit the movie isnt mean-spirited or exploitive. Its funny-bad not bad-bad which could make for fun snarky viewing when it quickly makes its way to television syndication.But be warned. Even for free Evil can feel like a bit of a rip-off. 13 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1lPX8lA",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/01/deliver-us-from-evil-movie-review/11912799/,200,deliverusfromevil25,deliverusfromevil,usatoday
"Review Deliver Us From Evil - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Deliver Us From Evil  Video Deliver Us From Evil pretty standard at least as exorcism films go Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Deliver Us From Evil"" the latest exorcism genre film starring Eric Bana and Olivia Munn. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Deliver Us From Evil"" the latest exorcism genre film starring Eric Bana and Olivia Munn. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Classed up by its cast ""Deliver Us From Evil"" concludes with a deliverance from evil in the form of a rip-roaring exorcism simply staged in a police interrogation room though goosed up with the usual barrage of digital effects. Routine in nearly every aspect the movie cannot be accused of holding out on its audience. The evils delivered and then dealt with.Co-writer and director Scott Derricksons extremely loose adaptation of the book ""Beware the Night"" (the films original less evil title) concerns the books co-author New York Police Department sergeant Ralph Sarchie played in the film by Eric Bana. Initially a skeptic this death-haunted cop joins forces with a rogue priest with a checkered past played by Edgar Ramirez who starred in the Olivier Assayas terrorism biopic ""Carlos."" Not yet entirely fluent in English Ramirez clips off the ends of his sentences and burrows into the recesses of his character letting Bana do the heavy dramatic lifting. Rather than establishing and then following a straightforward compact case of alleged true-life possession as did last years gem ""The Conjuring"" ""Deliver Us From Evil"" finds evil all over the Bronx where Sarchie works the 46th Precinct and has seen a lions share of inhumane behavior long before true evil shows up. A prologue finds an Iraq War veteran Santino (Sean Harris) encountering ominous cave inscriptions scrawled in Latin. A combat videographer he records the scene until the devil unleashes a swarm of bees or something near a pile of human skulls. The footage cuts abruptly to black.The soldier comes home alive but demonized. He opens up a house-painting business and one can imagine the Angies List description ""Santinos great VERY intense. Hes possessed so he really does work like the devil."" Derrickson made ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" nearly a decade ago a rather better example of this genre. As Santinos pernicious influence spreads several other characters come under his spell. The story sorts through them all dutifully beginning with the domestic disturbance call answered by Sarchie and his partner a smirk in a turned-around baseball cap as portrayed by Joel McHale.An atmosphere of dread is established the old-fashioned way by placing various children at risk. Sarchies own past has been stained by his capture of a murderous child molester. Derrickson exploits all this in a half-and-half way; half the time ""Deliver Us From Evil"" is genuinely interested in Sarchies all-too-human demons and half the time were marking time until the big exorcism and an ending that keeps the door open for a sequel should the market demand it.mjphillipstribune.com""Deliver Us From Evil"" - 2 starsMPAA rating R (for bloody violence grisly images terror throughout and language)Running time 158Opens Wednesday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Law Enforcement Authors Reviews Eric Bana Scott Derrickson Edgar Ramirez Video Deliver us from evil (Trailer) Deliver Us From Evil Latest movie reviews Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-deliver-us-from-evil-20140701,0,7902392.column",200,deliverusfromevil26,deliverusfromevil,chicagotribune
