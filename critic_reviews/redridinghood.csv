Director Catherine Hardwicke departed the franchise under contentious circumstances after the first part and here revisits key story elements in medieval settings as Amanda Seyfrieds virginal-yet-venturesome heroine (pictured) finds herself torn between romantic rivals (lusty woodchopper Shiloh Fernandez sensitive blacksmith Max Irons) and communing with the dark side - here a cute digital werewolf. Yes theres enough connection with the sources underlying issues of repression and desire to give this reason to exist but boy does Hardwicke labour in getting from fairy tale to would-be psycho-thriller. For a start its hard to take any of this seriously. It doesnt help that it unfolds on sets which reek of Ye Olde Gift Shoppe while the plot set-up whereby the community lay out sacrifices to keep the big bad wolf at bay are an unwise reminder of The Village. Still at least Gary Oldman jollies things up as a werewolf-hunting prelate with teutonic sibilants and a 20-ton cast-iron elephant-shaped torture device at his disposal. Yes you did read that right and very odd it is too though in a way the incongruity of such fripperies next to Julie Christies sinister granny and teen soap-theatrics give Hardwickes film a car-crash fascination outweighing its lack of real threat or suspense.

I had low expectations going in but was surprised at how interested i was with the central mystery of who the ""werewolf"" was. I also liked Gary Oldman who hasnt enjoyed playing this kind of bad guy for ages and ages (on the cinema). The cgi Wolf is terrible and badly realised. Having it talk as well is a big mistake. I liked the acting overall. I was amazed at how much Max Irons look is like his mother Sinead Cusack he is bascially Jeremy Irons with a scooby doo mask of his mother on... Hahaha. The good cast elevate this a wee bit and it was stolen by Gary Oldman Lukas Hass and Julie Christie as the strangely secretive grandmother.

By Peter Rainer Film critic March 12 2011 Save for later Saved Amanda Seyfried is torn between beau and beast as Valerie wearer of the garment in the title role in the fantasy thriller Red Riding Hood. Warner Bros. Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Catherine Hardwicke the director of ""Twilight"" is back with another not-so-thinly-veiled sexcapade posing as myth. ""Red Riding Hood"" stars Amanda Seyfried as Valerie a doe-eyed maiden from olden times whose village has been enduring an uneasy pact with the local werewolf. Each full moon they offer up an animal sacrifice but when Valeries sister is mortally mauled the villagers cry foul and form a werewolf posse. Theyre in for a surprise even if we arent.As in ""Twilight"" our heroine is torn almost literally between two men. Valerie loves Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) who looks as if he could easily morph into a werewolf but she is being coaxed into an arranged marriage with the poetically puppyish Henry (Max Irons). When notorious werewolf hunter Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) is hired by the villagers to vanquish the beast he offers up the unpleasant tidbit that the werewolf lives as a human among them.Oldman makes a four-course dinner out of the scenery with enough slash and burn to leave you wondering if he is vying with Nicolas Cage for the title of filmdoms biggest hambone. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Once the good/bad father drops this bombshell ""Red Riding Hood"" turns into a grisly whodunit. Hardwicke and her screenwriter David Johnson make a point of singling out practically every villager with a speaking part as possible werewolf material. Even Valerie was looking a bit shaggy around the edges. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The werewolfs identity when finally revealed is not such a big deal because the steps leading up to the revelation arent terribly logical. What should have been an ""Aha"" moment is more like ""Whatever.""The real commercial draw here of course is the ""Twilight""-ish triangle consisting of Valerie and her dueling beaus. Since I thought ""Twilight"" was more hoot than hot this watered down derivation of that film left me even colder.Hardwicke tries to fob it off as a daring exercise in fairy-tale subversion - a childrens fable for adults or to be more accurate young adults. But the sexual subtext to famous fairy tales isnt exactly news. (It certainly wasnt to Freud or Bruno Bettelheim.) Does Hardwicke think shes being daring by dropping the ""Little"" from ""Little Red Riding Hood""?With the exception of Oldman who at least is entertaining and Julie Christie who has a small role as Valeries hippie-ish grandmother the acting in this film is execrable. Even the werewolf who has a few growly lines gives a bad performance.In commercial terms none of this may matter. Audiences looking for another ""Twilight"" - and you know who you are - will probably line up for this one too. I hope not. Just when you think youve finished with one of these annoying franchises another one pops up to plague you. Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for violence and creature terror and some sensuality.)

"Red Riding Hood movie review A werewolf is on the loose in reimagined tale |       NJ.com comments Red Riding Hood movie review A werewolf is on the loose in reimagined tale Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 11 2011 at 758 AM View/Post Comments Kimberly French In ""Red Riding Hood"" the title character played by Amanda Seyfried must choose between a poor woodsman played by Shiloh Fernandez and the prosperous village blacksmith; either of them might be a werewolf. Valerie is torn between two lovers. Does she marry Henry the village smithy and its most prosperous catch? (Hey its a very small village.) Or does she go off with her true love Peter the poor woodsman? Its an even tougher choice than you might think -- because one of these boys might be a werewolf. And then Valerie would really be torn. Director Catherine Hardwicke seems to be a little conflicted too. Has she moved on from the ""Twilight"" saga? Or not? She parted from the series officially and not particularly amicably after the kickoff and theyve gone on to other directors (including David Slade who gave the last undead epic a jolt of new life.) Yet her first post-vamp project seems like well ""Twi-lite."" Cameras in helicopters swooping over treetops for panoramic shots of wet dark forests? Young pale woman unable to choose between two devoted young men? Giant CGI werewolves? Its all here. But do you really want it again? Movie Review Red Riding Hood (PG-13) Warner Bros. (100 min.) Directed by Catherine Hardwicke. With Amanda Seyfried Gary Oldman. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains sensuality and violence. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS There are other problems with the script ostensibly based on the fairy tale (and yes it finds an excuse to drag in the ""What big eyes you have"" exchange). The dialogue is feeble and some of the details -- whether the writers or Hardwickes -- are absurd. A traveling witch hunter arrives accompanied by a Japanese warrior and tortures people by locking them up in a giant hollow elephant. (Did it eventually relocate to the Jersey shore?) The heroines grandmother builds her Keebler-elf home around a huge hollowed-out tree -- and uses it as a fireplace. (Im imagining her stove is a giant box made out of matchsticks.) A lot of this looks interesting (the village and the woods for example are a riot of spikes triangles and sharp points) and thats probably Hardwickes chief concern. She worked for years as a production designer and her own movies always have a strong visual sense. She also always has had an easy identification with young people -- something else that serves her well here. And Amanda Seyfried is fine as the chaste (and chased) heroine photographed far more flatteringly than she has been in some recent films. But her two suitors Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons will make you long for Robert Pattinson (even if you arent doing so already). Heck they even made me miss Taylor Lautner. The movie looks beautiful. It has some interesting faces among the supporting cast even if its a bit disappointing to see some of them here (oh Julie Christie really?). And at least its whos-the-monster plot does a good job of keeping a secret. But if youre a ""Twilight"" fan you may feel as though youve already seen this. And if youre not well why would you be interested in something like this at all?

"Review Red Riding Hood far from legendary - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Viadeo Review Red Riding Hood far from legendary By Tom Charity CNN Amanda Seyfried stars as the main character in the film ""Red Riding Hood."" STORY HIGHLIGHTSFilm ""Red Riding Hood"" is retelling of the classic fairytaleDirector Catherine Hardwicke also directed ""Twilight""Reviewer says its not suspenseful enough to pass for horror RELATED TOPICS Amanda Seyfried Movies Movie Reviews Entertainment (CNN) -- ""Twilight"" director Catherine Hardwicke brings something borrowed something new but certainly nothing blue to her girl-centric retelling of the old fairytale ""Little Red Riding Hood."" The new film ""Red Riding Hood"" is a weird hybrid that means to tap the adolescent yearnings of Stephanie Meyer fans but which will more likely suffer the same sorry fate as Amanda Seyfrieds last supernatural schlocker ""Jennifers Body."" Seyfrieds saucer-eyed Riding Hood does wear a scarlet cape but she goes by the name of Valerie and shes not so little as she used to be. Old enough to be engaged to the village blacksmith Henry (Max Irons) whom her mother considers a better catch than Valeries childhood sweetheart Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) a mere woodcutter. In a gambit thats filched directly from Meyer the rival suitors both have their good points and some less attractive qualities. Peter is the romantic type ready to elope anywhere to the sea to the mountains even to the city if Valerie so desires. But hes also a big sulk and too tempestuous to be entirely reliable. Henry on the other hand is as loyal as a puppy dog several inches taller than Peter and not prone to rash bravery. Irons is also a marginally worse actor; he may not work with wood but hes quite the plank. Either of these hunks could be the werewolf terrorizing the village -- the beast has the hots for Valerie -- though neither of them shows any sign of incipient vampirism. Hardwicke began her career as a production designer and the angular thorny buildings are the most evocative aspect of a movie that more often suggests medieval times as Bill and Ted might have imagined them Lukas Haas as the village priest anyone? Virginia Madsen and Billy Burke (yes Bellas dad) as Valeries parents? Even Julie Christies grandmother speaks with an American accent while the village hairdresser must have been an ancestor of Vidal Sassoon. At least Christie can act even if shes hardly convincing as the little red herring Hardwicke asks her to play in a succession of heavy-handed scare tactics. The same goes for Gary Oldman whose purple turn as the fearless werewolf hunter Solomon somehow rises above camp to evoke the witch-hunting hysteria of ""The Crucible"" -- if only Arthur Miller had thought to throw in a giant tin elephant on wheels as an Inquisitorial torture device. With his entourage of black and Asian bodyguards and a heavily fortified carriage from which his young daughters only fleetingly emerge Solomon is such an exotic fish Hardwicke doesnt seem to know what to make of him. Even so whenever hes on screen Oldman single handedly resuscitates David Johnsons half-baked script. Thats no small feat. Not nearly suspenseful enough to pass as a horror film ""Red Riding Hood"" is an awkward supernatural whodunit weighed down by banal dialogue more suited to a teen soap and Hardwickes clumsy direction. When you find yourself comparing it unfavorably with ""Jennifers Body"" and M Night Shyamalans ""The Village"" well it cant be a good sign.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 11 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English What big eyes and lips Amanda Seyfried has. And what nice cheekbones Julie Christie who plays her grandmother has. Unfortunately these are about the only outstanding features in Red Riding Hood a lust-lacking Gothic teen reworking of the fairy tale from director Catherine Hardwicke that does nothing helpful for either of its talented stars. Movies Red Riding Hood The official trailer The swooping cameras over the British Columbia evergreen forest is our first clue that Red Riding Hood is a sheepish copy of Twilight the mega-hit franchise starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson a franchise that Hardwicke launched in 2008. The script by David Leslie Johnson ( Orphan) reworks some elements of Beowulf with a medieval somewhere-in-Europe mountain village named Daggerhorn that is plagued by a man-eating supernatural beast. The villages resident hottie Valerie (Seyfried) has a more pressing problem. Her parents (Virginia Madsen and Twilights Billy Burke) wont let her marry her childhood sweetheart the local woodcutter Peter (Shiloh Fernandez). Instead they think shell advance herself socially by getting hitched to the blacksmith Henry (Max Irons son of Jeremy). When Valeries on the verge of running away with her woodsman beau her sister gets killed by the wolf. After a couple of generations of keeping the creature at bay by sacrificing livestock this alteration in wolf behaviour is worrisome. Also Henry comes to pay his respects and press his marriage suit and the first of several unintentional laughs results. With its stilted dialogue fragments of voice-over and over-busy camera Red Riding Hood feels off-kilter from the start. Things pick up marginally with the arrival of a werewolf expert Father Solomon played by Gary Oldman speaking in a meandering German-Slavic accent as he chews the scenery. Father Solomon promptly creates general panic by explaining that the beast is a werewolf who lives among them in human form changing each full moon. Whats more the upcoming ultra-rare ""blood moon"" means someones soul is about to be taken. A showman who brings with him two African bodyguards a planetary model and an elephant-shaped iron torture device Father Solomon doesnt seem like someone you should dismiss. Nevertheless the foolish villagers who have beheaded an ordinary wolf by mistake choose to have a big party instead with a lot of Burning Man-style chanting and drumming. Not surprisingly they have an uninvited guest - a smudgy-looking CGI-generated beast which takes a moment out from its rampage to telepathically speak to Valerie. This raises her suspicion that the werewolf in human form must be someone close to her. Suspicion falls on one character after another with a certain monotonous predictability. Could it be the Peter the woodsman with the black gelled hair? Or perhaps the handsome and self-effacing Henry with the soft bangs? Or perhaps Valeries oddball grandma (Christie) who has a habit of growling and feeding her granddaughter bowls of dark lumpy soup. Judging by the plot the major ingredient must be red herrings. Apart from Valeries crimson cape which looks pretty when shes running against snowy landscapes theres not much else thats red about Red Riding Hood. With its rating-conscious care in avoiding displays of gore the movie even manages to strip away the gruesome delights of the original childrens story.

Pictures Shiloh Fernandez and Amanda Seyfried in ""Red Riding Hood"" (Warner Bros. Pictures) The folk tale ""Little Red Riding Hood"" is a fascinating metaphor for feminine sexual awakening -- if you happen to be 12 years old and have never seen ""The Howling"" ""Wolfen"" ""The Company of Wolves"" ""The Woodsman"" ""The Brothers Grimm"" ""Hoodwinked"" or that old cartoon where the wolf wears a zoot suit.""Red Riding Hood"" the latest incarnation of this oh-so-symbolic story actually had the potential of being something fresh because it was directed by the femme-centric Catherine Hardwicke who made the brutally honest coming-of-age movie ""Thirteen."" But since that auspicious debut Hardwicke has directed the drab Virgin Mary movie ""The Nativity Story"" and the turgid first ""Twilight"" flick. Apparently Hardwickes been bitten by the rabid curse of Hollywood because ""Red Riding Hood"" is such a sorrowful attempt to resurrect the marketing magic of ""Twilight"" that it ought to be titled ""Career Eclipse."" Granted Hardwicke has a visually distinctive style which expresses itself in smeary psychedelic dreamscapes that seem appropriate for this fable. But in the center of this meltdown is a black hole named Amanda Seyfried whose free ride through our collective consciousness should be ending any second now. Seyfrieds only hope is that some of the blame gets shifted to her co-stars who include a pouty poseur named Shiloh Fernandez as a hunky young woodcutter who wants to trim the forest Virginia Madsen as a medieval mom and Julie Christie as a Germanic grandma who may or may not be preying upon the village virgins.Incredibly the worst offender in the cast could be Gary Oldman who plays a holier-than-thou werewolf hunter with a terrible Transylvanian accent. His character comes to town to warn the locals that the hound of hell thats been killing their kids is actually one of their neighbors.

(French/Warner Bros) Joe Neumaier Friday March 11 2011 400 AM Title Red Riding Hood With Amanda Seyfried Gary Oldman. Update of the fairy tale. Director Catherine Hardwicke. (140) At area theaters.The amazingly awful dramatic thriller ""Red Riding Hood"" could with tweaks be enjoyably bad in a ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" kind of way. Instead its M. Night Shyamalan-style bad which means despite all the unintentional snickers you feel trapped.Amanda Seyfried is Valerie a comely lass living in a small mountain village terrorized by a werewolf. After two decades the beast kills again though the townspeople sacrifice animals every full moon. To warn everyone elders hang a big full moon with a frowny face on a stick.Werewolf hunter Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) arrives to kill the creature and notices that ripe Valerie with her longing to escape and illicit romance with Peter the woodcutters son is the one the wolf wants. But who is the wolf? Everyones a suspect from Valeries grandma (poor poor Julie Christie) to Claude the jabbering village idiot.Director Catherine Hardwicke whose first ""Twilight"" film looks like ""Citizen Kane"" with fangs compared to this takes things sooo seriously which translates as buffoonery. The towns party when the monster is presumed dead resembles a Lilith Fair with pig masks. Solomon tortures people by placing them in a huge elephant-shaped box. The boring Jacob-like wolf speaks to Valerie telepathically .Every actor hams it up and their fear-stricken looks are pure Mel Brooks parody. Leading the charge is Oldman practically tearing apart the cheap Keebler Elves set and shouting ""That is not a werewolf it is a common gray wolf"" and ""Lock him in the elephant""Just as silly is Seyfrieds voiceover reminding us that ""good girls dont hunt rabbits."" Still her ""big eyes big ears big teeth"" soliloquy is truly terrifying because you realize that Hollywoods new fetish for ""reimagining"" fairy tales has only just begun.

Photo (c)Warner Bros/courtesy Everett Co Gary Oldman is a clergyman who practices what he preaches getting that mangy monster Gary Oldman plays a priest warrior in ""Red Riding Hood."" ( ) I have no idea how to blow up a two-page fairy tale into 100 minutes of blockbuster but frankly I was hoping for more backstory about the titular cape in ""Red Riding Hood."" Thread count? Machine washability? Does it come in a cotton-linen blend for shoulder season? The questions that do get answered in this hazy clanking tale of a Dark Ages maiden (Amanda Seyfried) are not a lot more interesting than the above. The cape it turns out is a gift from an old lady (Julie Christie) who gives it to granddaughter Valerie because the girl is feeling er blue. ""I was making it for your wedding"" explains Grandma. Yes nothing says wedding like the latest from the harlotry palette. Director Catherine Hardwicke who did the first ""Twilight"" movie and the equally dull sullen-girl flick ""Thirteen"" has a gift for taking situations of bloodcurdling thrills and investing them with all of the drama of a sophomore fussing over her prom date. PHOTOS AMANDA SEYFRIEDS STYLE Will Valerie marry her childhood boyfriend Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) or accept an arranged marriage with the equally gelled and handsome Henry (Max Irons the spawn of Jeremy)? Theyre both such nice sweet boys that I look forward to being sold a T-shirt by one or both at Medieval Outfitters. Luckily two creatures that like to chew up everything around them are on hand a wolf that is terrorizing the village and Gary Oldman who is terrorizing the wolf sort of. Oldman back in maximum-Oldman mode after dialing it down for the ""Dark Knight"" movies is a psycho warrior-priest (named um Father Solomon?) self-tasked with moving into town and killing the animal. The fangy one is actually a wolfman who by day slips away and hides out in the form of one of the villagers (seems like it would be hard to carry out this ruse for very long; Ive seen community colleges bigger than this town) but during the three-day ""blood moon"" phase lets his inner Charlie Sheen take over. Fr. Solomon shriekingly explains all this and much more rulebook stuff then wastes our time sticking the village idiot who has nothing to do with anything in an oven. Otherwise Solomon has little to do with the story. For instance Hes got press-on silver nails with which he plans to kill the wolf although if your plan is to fell a raging supernatural beast the size of a horse by digging your nails into him you really shouldnt be allowed to graduate from warrior-priest school. Also it takes far too long for the film to inform us (""Oh by the way . . ."") that the wolf cant enter holy ground such as a churchyard. So why hasnt the whole town whose citizens have been treated like an Alpo buffet by the wolf gone to the mattresses at the church? And why does the priest hang around the perimeter taunting the wolf and reaching invitingly over the boundary? Hardwicke throws in the dad from ""Twilight"" to play the papa again but this box-office good-luck charm is about as likely to work as silver fingernails. She doesnt even consider the psychosexual implications that go with the crimson cloak and feminine nubility. Valeries hoodie could just as easily be periwinkle or chardonnay This isnt ""Red Swan."" Instead we get evidence that the screenwriter half-remembers ""The Crucible"" (your own neighbor could be the wolf etc.) in a theme that goes nowhere a ""What big eyes you have Grandma"" scene that being relegated to a dream sequence also means nothing and some tepid mystery about which villager the wolf really is. This ""big reveal"" though yields only several more sludgy minutes of exposition and some just-in-case sequel setup. Nice try but it wont happen. To date Amanda Seyfried has still never been associated with a movie moment as petrifying as Pierce Brosnans attempted singing in ""Mamma Mia."" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Former Frasier star Kelsey Grammer to become a grandfath...

Starring Amanda Seyfried Gary Oldman Billy Burke Lukas Haas Shiloh Fernandez Michael Shanks Julie Christie Virginia Madsen Max Irons Darren Shahlavi Director Catherine Hardwicke Running time 200 Release Opened Mar 11 2011  Editorial Review A tale cloaked in pretensionBy Ann HornadayFriday March 11 2011O for the love of all thats Grimm what hath ""Twilight"" wrought? Hard on the heels of ""Beastly"" a modern retelling of ""Beauty and the Beast"" comes the revisionist fairy tale ""Red Riding Hood"" a lurid loopy utterly ludicrous enterprise that seeks to twist the ultimate fable of feminine fear and victimhood into an allegory for finding your inner bad girl. Channeled by the ethereally beautiful Amanda Seyfried the townsmaiden Valerie is all wide eyes and English-rose innocence as she longs for her soul mate a humble woodcutter named Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) but is forced to marry the wealthier and far less dangerous Henry (Max Irons). When the town is attacked by the Big Bad Werewolf that resides in the nearby Very Dark Woods the local priest looks for salvation in a hired werewolf-assassin named Father Solomon (Gary Oldman); soon the holy man has neighbors looking at one another for signs that one of them possesses distinctly lupine tendencies. Director Catherine Hardwicke who directed the first ""Twilight"" movie reportedly considered Taylor Lautner for the role of Peter a nod to Team Jacob that suggests she took on ""Red Riding Hood"" purely out of spite for having been fired from the lucrative vampire franchise. (She did hire ""Twi""-dad Billy Burke to play Valeries father.) At least that theory helps explain how she could have become involved in such a misguided project which veers wildly in tone between self-seriousness and outright parody. Hardwicke a former production designer has come up with a visual style that emphasizes the storys fanciful roots; her trees are evocatively spiky and the wintry landscape is dotted with splashes of bright unseasonal color. But despite Hardwickes pictorial gifts she has no sense of tonal control; what might have been a fascinating exercise in creative anachronism a la Sofia Coppolas ""Marie Antoinette"" instead just looks like an episode of ""Gossip Girl"" set at a Medieval Times restaurant. (Tellingly Hardwicke hired Coppolas frequent musical collaborator Brian Reitzell to compose the score which reaches the apex of overreaching hipness in a vaguely lewd dance-slash-rave.) For the strenuous effort Hardwicke puts in to juice up ""Red Riding Hood"" with hormonal lust and psychosexual meaning the movie remains an oddly wan bloodless affair. My what big pretensions it has. And not a cogent idea in its pretty little head.Contains violence and creature terror and some sensuality.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Red Riding Hood My What a Ridiculous Plot You Have A sexed-up dumbed-down cross between the childrens fairy tale and The Wolfman Red Riding Hood is mostly a snack for tweens between meals of Twilight By Mary Pols MaryPolsMarch 10 2011 Share Read Later Kimberly French / Warner Bros. EntertainmentAmanda Seyfried stars as Valerie in Red Riding Hood Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Was Red Riding Hood masterminded by a cadre of particularly silly 11-year-olds undergoing withdrawal from Twilight? Thats the only excuse for a movie this dopey. David Johnsons screenplay is amateurish and tone-deaf and director Catherine Hardwicke best known for the perfume-commercial tone of that first Twilight movie and Thirteen must have actively encouraged her fleet of able supporting actors to embarrass themselves. Julie Christie Virginia Madsen Lukas Haas and Gary Oldman couldnt have reached these depths on their own. The best performance in this movie is by a garment -- the hooded red cape itself -- which swirls and billows fetchingly in the snow. It no longer belongs to a little girl because duh that wouldnt be sexy at all. The 21st century Red Riding Hood is Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) the prettiest minx in the medieval village of Daggerhorn. In the woods outside the village dwells a werewolf who has long terrorized the place. Correction for 20 years the werewolf has happily gobbled up their sacrificial offerings of cute lambs and baby pigs but suddenly is no longer content with livestock. Just as the story begins it has slain Valeries younger plainer sister Lucie and left her in a hayfield. Not to downplay the tragedy but one cant help noticing that Lucies corpse no entrails out of place looks pretty good for someone who collided with a werewolf. (See pictures of Hollywoods most famous wolfmen.) Speaking of downplaying the tragedy Seyfrieds enormous my-what-big-eyes-you-have peepers moisten for a scene or two but Lucies death doesnt distract her for long. Just like Twilights Bella she has a complicated love life to worry about. Shes crazy about snarly woodsman Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) but her mother (Madsen) has just arranged for her to marry a rich blacksmith named Henry (Max Irons). Peter isnt happy about that so the night after Lucies untimely demise he tries to make her jealous by dancing with another girl whereupon Valerie grabs her girlfriend for a display of Sapphic dirty dancing. Mourning in this village apparently takes the tone of Gossip Girl at the Renaissance fair. Oldman plays a man of the cloth -- hes known as Father Solomon -- who has some expertise in werewolf hunting. His methods include raising the paranoia level of everyone in the village while giving them lessons in the ways of the werewolf. ""You all know what the blood moon means"" he says to a crowd of Daggerhornians. They stare back at him blankly. ""They have no idea"" he says in disgust. This might seem uncharitable but Father Solomons disgust is not without merit; if youre going to be terrorized into constantly sacrificing your cuddliest livestock shouldnt you have some grasp of the beasts schedule? (See portraits of the Twilight stars.) Although hes a reliable chewer of scenery Oldman is thwarted here by the sheer number of thespians already gnawing on the log cabins of Daggerhorn including Christie who plays Valeries grandmother. The role is so obviously ornamental -- Christie rocks a sky blue quasi-dirndl and the low-slung hip belt that seems to be de rigueur in Daggerhorn -- that I spent the entire movie convinced she was Lauren Hutton trotted out from the J. Crew catalog to play the hot granny. Nothing about Christies performance argued otherwise and this is the perspective of someone who has long cherished her in movies from McCabe amp; Mrs. Miller right through Away from Her the film that earned her most recent Oscar nomination. Grandma Christie has a motto ""All sorrows are less with bread."" I tittered along with the preview audience every time it came up but decided to look upon it as a coded public-service message to the young girls who will likely see this film ""Carbs are good; dont starve yourselves"" There was plenty of time to entertain such ridiculous notions because the movie werewolves and all is too absurd to be dramatically engaging. Besides the beasts human identity the narratives other question mark the matter of Henry vs. Peter is about as suspenseful as Jacob vs. Edward. Or look at it this way Henry gives Valerie a pretty handmade bracelet while Peter tosses her down on the hay and plays with the laces on her bodice. Who would you choose? The level at which Red Riding Hood borrows from Twilight is not just limited to the dueling suitors and the werewolf component (oversized and able to move at lightning speed this wolf would fit right in with Jacobs crowd). The actor who plays Valeries father Billy Burke even plays Bellas dad in the Twilight series. And Valerie has a special bond with the creature she can talk to it which causes her to worry about her own nature. ""Maybe there was something dark inside me"" she speculates shortly after Father Solomon commands her to put on her ""harlots robe"" and prepare to be offered up to the wolf.

"Red Riding Hood The better to bore you with - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Red Riding Hood The better to bore you with By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke seems to be trying hard to cobble together a franchise of her own with Red Riding Hood a fantasy thriller loosely based on the fairy tale. By Kimberly French Warner Bros. Pictures To grandmothers house she goes Amanda Seyfried faces a werewolf. EnlargeClose By Kimberly French Warner Bros. Pictures To grandmothers house she goes Amanda Seyfried faces a werewolf. As in the Twilight saga the story involves a werewolf and a teenage girl with a couple of hunky teen boys lusting after her. Things conclude on a sly cliffhanger note setting it up for a sequel. You can almost hear the conversation with studio execs about how to reach the vampire- and werewolf-loving young female audience. TRAILER Get to know Red Riding Hood But Red Riding Hood has a thinner story than Stephenie Meyers Twilight series and seems to invent its own werewolf mythology. Its set in what looks like medieval times but the characters have a contemporary vibe. Amanda Seyfried plays Valerie a young girl in love with Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) a poor but hunky woodcutter. (Really is there any other kind?) Her parents however have arranged her marriage to the more well-off and also cute Henry (Max Irons). Her grandmother (Julie Christie) is far more glamorous than the old toothy crone of Grimms fairy tale. But she does live in a house that requires a walk through the woods. And she whips up the iconic crimson cape that transforms Valerie into the title character. About the movie Red Riding Hood  (out of four)Stars Amanda Seyfried Gary Oldman Billy Burke Shiloh Fernandez Max Irons Julie Christie Lukas Haas Virginia MadsenDirector Catherine HardwickeDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13 for violence creature terror and some sensualityRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Meanwhile the uneasy truce between the denizens of Valeries picturesque village and a marauding werewolf is shattered when the wolf kills Valeries older sister. In a scene straight out of Beauty and the Beast the townsfolk gather up pitchforks and scythes shouting ""Kill the beast"" A minister (Lukas Haas) sends for werewolf specialist Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) who suspects that one of the villagers is the dreaded werewolf. The best that can be said is that the production design is striking. Otherwise its a foolish story marred by a strange blend of overacting and bland offhand performances.

"A fairy tale bathed in tepid Twilight - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs A fairy tale bathed in tepid TwilightRed Riding Hood a 2 starsMarch 10 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic""One bite"" whispers the man with the supernatural gaze to the woman in the hood ""and youll be like me."" Wait. Is this the latest arrival in the ""Twilight"" franchise?Contractually no. In every other way yes. ""Red Riding Hood"" director Catherine Hardwickes overheated yet underpowered version of the Little Red Riding Hood folk tale reworks the cautionary lesson and sexual-awakening allegory for a generation weaned on ""Charmed"" and ""Twilight"" and ""Mean Girls"" and the relentlessly popular musical version of ""Wicked."" Between this movie and ""Battle Los Angeles"" both sexes and various species of 15-year-olds are getting a ripe old load of what Hollywood believes they want this week.Shot almost entirely on soundstages this is an oddly claustrophobic depiction of a French-type village (key early versions of the folk tale were French) long ago and far away. The village Daggerhorn has a werewolf situation. All becomes paranoia and bloodlust when the monster kills the sister of the prettiest thing in town Valerie played by Amanda ""What Big Eyes You Have"" Seyfried.Valeries hot for the local hunky woodcutter (Shiloh Fernandez a tiny step up from Taylor Lautner mediocrity) but family circumstances dictate her arranged marriage to the nice but less smoldering boy with money (Max Irons). Valerie protests; her mother played by Virginia Madsen counters with ""I know what a woodcutter earns"" Laboring under unfortunate peasant hair Billy Burke Bellas hapless but sensitive father in the ""Twilight"" series plays Valeries pop. Julie Christie pops up as the grandmother who always has a stew going on the fire and who reminds her granddaughter that ""we all have secrets.""With its puckeringly sweet color scheme ""Red Riding Hood"" resembles a Renaissance Faire beset by a computer-generated wolf. The guiding notion of David Leslie Johnsons screenplay is that we all have a wolf inside of us. Valeries apparent psychic communication with the werewolf draws accusations of witchcraft fomented by the visiting wolf-removal specialist hammed righteously by that reliable righteous ham Gary Oldman. So ""Red Riding Hood"" is really more like a revival of ""The Crucible"" staged at a Renaissance Faire.""Red Riding Hood"" has its moments of straight-faced silliness and occasional beauty. Hardwicke brought some modesty and feeling to the first ""Twilight"" film and shes one of the few contemporary American directors who knows how and when to deploy slow-motion for poetic effect. Schlocky poetic effect true but what do you want in a movie like this? Actual cinematic poetry?All in all though Stephen Sondheim did Red better in ""Into the Woods"" in a mere two-lyric passage in just one song. ""He made me feel excited/Well excited and scared"" that girl in the hood confessed pointing up the dangerous sexual awakening inherent in the story. Seyfrieds a good actress but all the art direction in the world cant make this version of events the stuff either of dreams or of nightmares.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for violence and creature terror and some sensuality)Cast Amanda Seyfried (Valerie); Gary Oldman (Solomon); Billy Burke (Cesaire); Shiloh Fernandez (Peter); Max Irons (Henry); Virginia Madsen (Suzette); Lukas Haas (Father Auguste); Julie Christie (Grandmother)Credits Directed by Catherine Hardwicke; written by David Leslie Johnson; produced by Jennifer Davisson Killoran Leonardo DiCaprio and Julie Yorn.

Posted March 11 2011 -- 1200 AM EST We get it. The Twilight trilogy both in books and movies is a gigantic hit. But holy demographics -- its time for new blood Red Riding Hood the latest movie project under the influence of Stephenie Meyers opus takes a timeless fairy tale juicy with its own vivid metaphors of sex death danger and young people -- and then goes all goofily Bella Swan-ish on the classic. The result is a dolled-up overblown pandering romantic costume drama thats not only sillier than the filmmakers surely intended but also if you follow the plot implications all the way to the end way ickier too. (Im not going to spoil the suspense by describing those plot implications but trust me theyre icky.) You of course remember the original A girl in a (menstrual?) blood-red cloak goes over the river and through the woods to her grandmother?s house. Virginal and good she ignores the come-ons of a wolf (no subtlety in that lupine metaphor). But when she gets to Grandmas theres something about the old ladys big eyes ears and teeth that frightens her -- as they ought to since the wolf having already eaten Granny disguises himself as the old lady and then eats Little Red too. Eventually a manly hunter comes along and kills the wolf and pulls grandmother and granddaughter out alive. Curl up with Bruno Bettelheims seminal analytic study of fairy tales The Uses of Enchantment to read more about virginity loss thereof. Settle in with the Red Riding Hood directed by Catherine Hardwicke -- yes the same CH who directed the original Twilight -- and youre in a whole other neck of the deep dark woods. This 2.0 version of the Girl Wrapped in Red is called Valerie. As played with wide eyes a creamy decolletage and a nice hint of a dirty smile by Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia) Valerie has a cool blond complexion that masks a hot streak of defiance and lust. In an arrangement meant to help her poor family Valerie has been promised in marriage to the towns rich boy a perfectly handsome young gent named Henry (Max Irons) who really does care for her. But her heart and her desires belong to Peter (Shiloh Fernandez). Thats because Peter is a more impetuous danger-loving bad-boy type. Theres jealousy in the air -- and when it isnt coming from the competing suitors its emanating from the other village lasses Mean Girls-style. (Hardwicke also directed Thirteen about an impressionable teen girl and her mean new friend.) Let it be known that Irons (son of Jeremy Irons and Sinead Cusack and grandson lets add of the wonderful actor Cyril Cusack) and TV actor Fernandez (no news on his parents or grandparents) make perfectly fine swains. Let it also be known that its sometimes difficult to tell whos who so subtly do their two cute-boy faces morph into one. So far Peter = Twilights Edward Henry = Jacob Valerie = Bella. Under the circumstances did the producers really have to cast the same actor who plays Bellas father to play Valeries father too? Crazy confusing right? Billy Burke makes an okay father type and all but the target audience for Red Riding Hood is going to spend half the movie wondering what Forks chief of police Charles Swan is doing in buckskin boots chugging from a wineskin then falling down drunk in his own vomit. Meanwhile back in the Brothers Grimm-type village a werewolf (upgraded for Hollywood purposes from standard wolf status) has been terrifying the locals. Right at the top of the story he kills Valeries sister and the beast makes it clear that hes out for more blood -- specifically Valeries blood. And while the menfolk organize a search posse Valerie dithers about whom to trust. Whos the werewolf in human form? Rich kid Henry? Hothead Peter? (Cute that Peter and the Wolf thing another bedtime story altogether.) And what about Grandmother played by fairy-tale-alluring Julie Christie? Grannys a kind of witchy New Agey lady whose vibe changes from tender to sinister in the flick of an eye. With a script by David Leslie Johnson (his first feature screenplay credit) and Im guessing a lot of input from a gaggle of producers Red Riding Hood goes from trite to triter a plot collapse that overtakes any of the visual prettiness from cinematographer Mandy Walker (Beastly). A dead-end subplot involving casual Catholic-bashing introduces a hamvillainous Gary Oldman as a fearsome sadistic and stinking-rich priest in dandified robes who sidelines as a werewolf hunter. (He spends most of his time punishing his flock with grandiose Inquisition-worthy tortures.) But in the end this bad Father is forgotten and were back on all-too-familiar ground. ""One bite"" the werewolf tells Valerie ""and youll be like me."" Where have we heard that before?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres always been a dark erotic current to the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale; in the earliest known versions the Big Bad Wolf disguised as grandma orders the eponymous girl to take off her clothes burn them and climb into bed with him whereupon he devours her. Symbolically its a story about sexual conquest and the lurid temptations of the unknown more than about wild animals in the woods. So its no great surprise that in the post-Twilight era with bookstores devoting entire sections to ""supernatural romance"" and film trying to catch up with the wave someone did the math Heavy symbolism plus equating sexually predatory wolf with sexy hot young people equals potential box-office gold. Nor is it a surprise that the resulting film Red Riding Hood comes from Catherine Hardwicke director of Thirteen and the first Twilight film and noted obsessive when it comes to pretty people exploring their sexuality in ways that skip actual sex in favor of outsized emotions and occasional glowering. Her interpretation scripted by Orphan screenwriter David Leslie Johnson comes with a Twilight-ready love triangle and a Twilight-esque vapid heroine in the form of Amanda Seyfried. Growing up in a generic but lovely fantasy setting akin to that of M. Night Shyamalans The Village Seyfrieds character has long been in love with woodcutter Shiloh Fernandez (reportedly Hardwickes second choice to play Twilights Edward Cullen). But Seyfrieds mother (a tragically underused Virginia Madsen) wants better things for her and has brokered a marriage to blacksmiths son Max Irons who is moodily in love with Seyfried. Complicating all this The village is plagued by a powerful werewolf which also has designs on Seyfried. To top things off Gary Oldman plays the fanatical Bible-thumping leader of a team of werewolf-hunters who have designs on it in turn. Theres a great deal of campy overstatement to Red Riding Hood. Some of it like the vivid colors overripe Brothers Grimm-like set and costume design lush woodsy setting and aggressively active camera work at least adds visual interest. Some of it is gratingly unnecessary like the attempt to shoehorn in elements of the original fairy tale via a bunch of business involving Julie Christie as Seyfrieds grandmother or the thuddingly unsubtle political commentary seen in Oldmans insistence that the villagers sacrifice their privacy and freedoms in the name of security and religious purity. But mostly the overheated script and the overheated romance just feels like Twilight redux. The main difference is that while the Twilight films strive for straight-faced grimness Red Riding Hood often verges on outright florid hilarity. It isnt laughing at itself but that neednt stop the audience.

Pictures Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 Amanda Seyfried stars in Red Riding Hood. Amanda Seyfried stars in Red Riding Hood. Photo Warner Bros. Pictures Red Riding Hood 1 / 1 Back to Gallery For a movie about a bloodthirsty werewolf slashing up a tiny medieval village Red Riding Hood sure is pretty. First on the list of pretty things is the heroine a gal named Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) in a flowing red cape. Next is Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) the woodcutter she adores who curls his lip into the prettiest of sneers. Also pretty is Henry (Max Irons) the tousled smith who loves her unrequitedly. Her mother (Virginia Madsen) is pretty. Her grandmother is pretty; shes Julie Christie so she doesnt have much choice. Even her father (Billy Burke) is pretty at least when he isnt drunk on mead and asleep in his own puke. The mountains are pretty. The whorls of fake snow are pretty. The dappled storybook ambience and musky scent of adolescent horniness are pretty especially when Peter and Valerie snog by firelight on the soft hay in the granary. The only thing that isnt pretty the wolf itself a mangy black thing with yellow eyes and a weird ability to mind-speak with Little Red. No one calls her that but thats who she is -- the titular lass who skips through the forest to Grandmas house in her hand-crafted hooded outerwear meeting the wolf en route. Catherine Hardwickes prettified movie is a strange adaptation because it supplants the woodsy horror of the original fairy tale with two new elements a romantic triangle and a witch hunt. This isnt so much Little Red Riding Hood as The Crucible meets that old Gossip Girl episode with the glitzy masked ball. Its best moments occur after Gary Oldman shows up as a werewolf hunter in a purple velvet cassock bringing a welcome jolt of hammy intensity to an otherwise humdrum mystery. Whos the werewolf? Is it someone in town? Could it be Peter? Henry? The snotty girl who turns on Valerie? Apparently its someone with brown eyes which seems like a helpful clue until close-ups reveal that almost every villager qualifies. Hardwicke started out as a tough-talking chronicler of girls (Thirteen) but shes been softening the focus for a few years now; her last effort was Twilight another pretty teen triangle with fangs. She and Orphan screenwriter David Johnson are clearly aiming to de-victimize their heroine - to remove her from peril stiffen her spine and empower her life choices - but theyve gutted all the terror from the story. If the Big Bad Wolf isnt central to the plot whats it doing there? Aside from killing an occasional two-dimensional character who means little to us it just lopes around at night representing the id. (According to some scholars the cape represents menstruation. Yup.) ""My mother always told me Dont talk to strangers. Go get water and come straight home. I tried to be a good girl and do what she said"" explains Valerie at the start. The rebel in her makes a bold move or two yes. But ultimately Red Riding Hood is just another movie about a girl pining for a boy defined by a boy held back by a boy. And thats not pretty. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Apple Smartwatches at Best Buy 50 off from 249 + free...

By Joe Morgenstern Updated March 11 2011 1201 a.m. ET Soon after the fevered opening of this latest ""Jane Eyre"" the far-off figure of the heroine unmoored on the moors stands at a crossroads that is hardly more than a crosspaths--four corners faintly traced in one of the films many understated yet transfixing vistas. Almost everything about Cary Fukunagas version of the Charlotte Bronte romance is understated yet transfixing mainly--although far from exclusively--because of Mia Wasikowskas presence in the title role. She embodies Janes most endearing qualities--courage passion devotion unadorned beauty--but not for a moment the moist poignance that many of the umpteen previous versions have inflicted on her. (Eighteen feature films to be exact and nine TV versions.) This Jane meets the world and everyone in it with a rock-solid sense of herself that can only be shaken by love. Ms. Wasikowska works with economical purity within the novels 19th-century English setting. Janes personal power seems entirely her own rather than some anachronistic notion of self-empowerment. Thats particularly stirring in a crucial moment of self-assertion--""Am I a machine without feelings?"" she begins--with Michael Fassbenders forbiddingly handsome Rochester. And its all the more impressive in light of the young Australian stars charmingly modern portrayal of an American teenage daughter in ""The Kids Are All Right."" ENLARGE Mia Wasikowska as the title character in Jane Eyre. Focus Features Speakeasy Does Jane Eyre Do Justice to the Book? But then the work of Mr. Fukunaga--who directed from a strong adaptation by Moira Buffini--is impressive too. He made his directorial debut two years ago with ""Sin Nombre"" a dramatically commanding and visually expansive account in Spanish of impoverished immigrants riding atop freight trains as they lumber through Mexico toward the U.S. border. That was a singular choice for the California-born son of a Swedish-American mother and a Japanese-American father though maybe not such a strange one given his rich family heritage. Choosing a remake of the oft-made Bronte classic did seem odd on the face of it and more than a little worrisome for those of us who cherished ""Sin Nombre"" and wished him only the best. As it turns out there was no need to worry. With these two productions each distinct from the other though connected by impeccable craftsmanship Mr. Fukunaga has arrived as a self-effacing master of his medium. He and Ms. Buffini have heightened the drama of their source material in two ways both successful. Theyve rearranged the narrative by starting with Janes heartsick flight from Thornfield Hall by spending useful time on her usually scanted encounter with St. John Rivers (Jamie Bell) and his family and by playing as powerful flashbacks her harsh childhood as an orphan as well as her time as a governess at Thornfield. The film also has somber fun with Thornfield as a haunted house of alarming sounds and squeaking timbers. The heart of the story remains Janes anguished love for Rochester and that heart beats strongly even though this ""Jane Eyre"" moves at a pace some may find slow I found it perfectly measured. Mr. Fassbenders lord of the cursed manor is worthy of his governesss love even though hes no match for the one played by Timothy Dalton when it comes to bottomless despair or towering rage and though he cant or wisely wont touch the doomy self-regard that Orson Welles brought to the role. Instead of a black hole taking energy in hes a pulsar pumping it out in the form of pain relieved at least for a while by wry humor and an openness to Janes beauty. Judi Dench as Rochesters housekeeper Mrs. Fairfax dispenses gentle humor unburdened by pain though enriched by maturity and kindness. Will Hughes-Jones designed the production. Michael OConnor did the marvelous costumes. When I wrote about ""Sin Nombre"" which was shot with graphic grandeur by the Brazilian cinematographer Adriano Goldman I called the use of 35mm film cameras instead of digital equipment a crucial aesthetic choice. Thats equally true of ""Jane Eyre"" which was shot by Mr. Goldman with equal virtuosity though in a very different visual style. His technique is painterly in its evocation of 19th century English artists. Beyond that its distinguished by an abundance of tonal variety interiors that seem to take on the smell of weathered furniture; softly modeled closeups that cast Jane as a country madonna; candlelit scenes that recall the magical warmth of ""Barry Lyndon."" To prove that I didnt embrace ""Jane Eyre"" uncritically Ill note that pulses were taken in the 19th century by checking the wrist not the carotid artery as shown here and Ill register an objection to the use of surround sound to create squeaking timbers at the back of the theater. This lovely film surrounds us without it. Mars Needs Moms Watch a clip from the animated sci-fi action film Mars Needs Moms. A 3-D animated feature from Disney ""Mars Needs Moms"" looks impressive up to a point. Most of the action takes place beneath the surface of Mars where hatchling kiddies are raised by nannybots in an elaborately technological setting that owes much of its retro esthetic to Terry Gilliam. But the film suffers from chronic light loss thats at least as depressing as the dumb story. Part of that loss is imposed by the storys terms--an earth mother or rather an Earth mother is kidnapped by a Martian civilization that keeps her underground to tap her parenting skills (shes voiced by Joan Cusack); and a deadline requires her son Milo (Seth Green) to rescue her before the Martian sunrise--in other words no hope of blue skies on the red planet. Even more light is lost to the 3-D glasses leading one to wonder during the movies frequent down times what the producers were thinking. ENLARGE Two of the maternally deficient aliens of Mars Needs Moms. ImageMovers ""Mars Needs Moms"" instills mom appreciation in Milo and is meant to do the same for all the Milos and Mileys in the audience. By the end the 9-year-old hero comes to see maternal authority as loving wisdom and eating broccoli or taking out the garbage as privileges instead of chores. But theres nothing to be said in favor of sitting through garbage and this movie is awash in the stuff both figuratively and literally One of its main locales is a vast garbage dump. The pace is frantic--""Inspector Gadget"" lives--and the secondary characters are nattering nuisances an Earth nerd Gribble (Dan Fogler) who may have been modeled on John Belushis screwball pilot in ""1941"" and a Martian girl Ki (Elisabeth Harnois) who spouts flower-child phrases like ""Mellow out man Im not the fuzz"" because shes obsessed with old TV reruns that travel from Earth to Mars as streaming video. Underdeveloped stories can be enhanced if not transformed by inventive animation as proved by the success of ""Rango."" That didnt happen here because the movie produced by Robert Zemeckis and directed by Simon Wells (the great-grandson of H.G. Wells) employs the same motion-capture technology that Mr. Zemeckis used in ""The Polar Express"" and ""A Christmas Carol."" There is motion-capture and motion-capture. When its done with the finesse of ""Avatar"" the process can be both amazing and invisible. When its done with the clumsiness of this production faces look like glove puppets and characters go through motions that are paradoxically lively but lifeless. Mars may need moms but Earth needs good movies and this isnt one of them. Red Riding Hood This tedious retelling of the venerable fairy tale--""Twilight"" with Oedipal kinks--takes place in a medieval village that is plagued by a werewolf and that looks like a shtetl settled by California actors. Watch a clip from Red Riding Hood starring Amanda Seyfried and Gary Oldman. For a while the joke seems intentional. The local beauty played by Amanda Seyfried and torn between two men eventually gets to wear a red outfit but her name is Valerie and the boy she secretly loves Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) has spiked hair. Unfortunately and thats putting it mildly the director Catherine Hardwick (she directed the first ""Twilight"" feature); the writer David Johnson and the denizens of the village are stuck in a style warp between today and the Middle Ages. Every now and then today holds sway ""Omigod you can speak"" Valerie says to the wolf who proves to be a fairly fluent conversationalist. ""Im gonna getcha outa here"" says Henry (Max Irons) the handsome but dull boy Valerie is supposed to marry. Mostly though the movie lumbers along in medieval mode what with Valeries stern father (Billy Burke also from ""Twilight"") telling her that ""its time to put on your harlots robe"" and Gary Oldmans witch-hunting Father Solomon telling everyone that ""during a Blood Moon your very souls are in danger."" Tone is everything in a venture like this and ""Red Riding Hood"" never finds a workable one; the only really good laugh comes when Valerie comments on her grandmothers big eyes big nose and big teeth. (Granny is played by Julie Christie who has fine features but that makes it funnier.) The ostensible mystery concerns the identity of the big bad werewolf (who looks like a creature found on the cutting-room floor of a defunct Claymation studio) but the real mystery is how an amusing idea could have gone so wrong. The movie must have been conceived during a Blood Moon. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Jane Eyre (1943) Cary Fukunaga has said that he grew up watching this black-and-white version with his mother; these days it can be streamed via Netflix. The director was Robert Stevenson who wrote the screenplay with no less a literary light than Aldous Huxley along with John Houseman (of Orson Welless Mercury Theater) and an uncredited Henry Koster. The production is dominated by Mr. Welles; his brooding Rochester has no use for understatement. Joan Fontaine is affecting but not very forceful as Jane. The cast includes Agnes Moorehead and Margaret OBrien who as Rochesters ward Adele struggles sweetly with a French accent. Brazil (1985) Terry Gilliams darkly funny and truly visionary retro-futurist fantasy is a mess dramatically and its turbulent history echoes the battles fought by Orson Welles against studio executives bent on recutting or scuttling his films. A three-disc Criterion release includes Mr. Gilliams 142-minute version plus Universals dreadful 94-minute recut version (with a happy ending) that the studio released unsuccessfully. Theres also a video history chronicling the filmmakers struggles with the studio all of which could have been avoided by the terms of his contract if hed been able to shorten his own cut to 125 minutes. Mamma Mia (2008) Amanda Seyfried is irrestistible as Sophie an ardent bride and the daughter of a former rocker Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep). Sophie doesnt know the identity of her father so unbeknownst to her mother she invites three plausible candidates from Donnas past to her wedding. Theyre played by Pierce Brosnan Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth who sing and dance gamely. Ever since the movie came out Ive been teased for my praise of such old-fashioned entertainment but its really entertaining and Ms. Streep plays lusty joyfulness just as fearlessly as she has ever played tragedy or riveting drama. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Hardwicke who has done sterling work on Thirteen and The Lords of Dogtown seems solely dedicated on styling her young leads as succulent morsels. I focused on how Daggerhorn looked zoned for 90210 and that both Peter and Henry had manicured locks expertly poofed with hair product that would cost a mint in Beverly Hills. Twi-hards desperate for a fix can decide whether to fall for this feeble facsimile or if theyre Team Peter or Team Henry. The rest of us can wonder if Hardwicke will ever get her mojo back. Even wild man Gary Oldman as a priest ready to eighty-six the wolfman with silver nail polish cant liven up this humorless hogwash. And its just sad to see the legendary Julie Christie stuck playing the grandmother. The better to scam you with my dear.

Funny? Yes. Sexy? For a minute or two (its rated PG-13 for chomping gore and for a few lusty throwdowns in the hay). Ridiculous? Most definitely.With the quavery saucer-eyed Amanda Seyfried in the title role Red Riding Hood is set in quaintest Daggerhorn an alpine burg where the wooden houses stand on stilts and the people stand in medieval hippie couture. Like a vintage Hollywood silent (or Guy Maddins 1992 cult gem Careful) events transpire within tight parameters - the village square the mead hall a verdant thicket in the woods. There are a few expansive shots of clouds undulating over a sunken valley ringed by mountains but mostly this is a bunch of actors running to and fro on a dressed-up soundstage. Realism is not high on Hardwickes list.What is high on the directors list is riffing on her own megahit the first Twilight. (Hardwicke had begged off the follow-up Twilight New Moon because the studio wanted it delivered post-haste.) To that end she has cast Billy Burke Bella Swans dad in Twilight as the father of Seyfrieds Valerie the scarlet-caped heroine. And Hardwicke and her screenwriter have turned the menacing wolf into a werewolf - the creature goes a-stalking when the moon is full - and imbued it with well vampirish characteristics. The beast cannot tolerate daylight nor holy places nor silver.Like Twilight too Red Riding Hood offers a love triangle. There is Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) a woodcutters son who has been in love with Valerie (and vice versa) since childhood. And there is Henry (Max Irons) the blacksmiths son promised to Valerie in an arranged marriage. ""I feel like Ive been sold"" Valerie bristles adding a dollop of feminist rage to this frothy brew.The rivalry between scrappy Peter and earnest Henry is intense - all the more so when a werewolf-slayer and his entourage roll into town informing the trembling citizenry that a lycanthrope walks among them that on all other nights of the month when the moon is waxing or waning this creature takes human form. As doubt and paranoia fog up the atmosphere and sinister circumstances ensue Valeries affections vacillate from one lad to the other. Team Peter or Team Henry anyone?As Father Solomon Gary Oldman hams it up royally. He wears a beard wields a sword sports silver fingernails (he needs to see the manicurist though) and makes declarations in vaguely Teutonic tones along the lines of ""Your very souls are in danger"" The likable Lukas Haas shambles in front of the lens more than others in the cast suggesting his presence has significance. Virginia Madsen is Valeries mother holding on to her own dark secrets and Julie Christie looking New Age-y in her faux dreadlocks is Valeries grandmother. (Thats three generations of Daggerhorn blondes.) And yes there is a ""What big teeth you have Grandma"" moment. Hardwicke may not plumb the Freudian depths but she can turn a joke or two.Seyfried holds the cameras attention playing this storybook business pretty much straight although David Leslie Johnsons script puts the actress sorely to the test. The shots of Valerie walking across the snow in her long red cape are splendid and aptly dreamlike; in fact the color-saturated look of the film gives it an almost psychedelic aura.Too bad the story doesnt resonate with the same intensity.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Movie review Red Riding Hood - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ExecutionMovie review Red Riding HoodSmartly conceived and beautifully shot horror spin on the fairy tale is undermined by bad execution.March 11 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Shauna Kain left as Roxanne and Amanda Seyfried as Valerie in ""Red... (Kimberly French / Warner...)The horror-tinged romance of ""Red Riding Hood"" is at its heart nothing more than a fashionable fairytale version of whats all the rage in teen love stories these days. The basic formula includes a moody beauty falling for the wrong boy who may actually be a vampire-alien-werewolf-whatever. Can ""Pinocchio at 15"" be far behind? With ""my what big eyes you have"" Amanda Seyfried as the girl in the scarlet cloak and that edgy shaman of young angst Catherine Hardwicke in the directors chair the movie comes with great expectations. So it kills me to say a or at least it bothers me a lot a that what we have here is a sheep in wolfs clothing. Gorgeously shot smartly conceived cleverly cast badly executed a the lush medieval beauty here is at best only skin deep. If this were a four-letter-word newspaper you would see a string of them now. In Hardwicke we have a director who understands and is able to channel onscreen the impossible ache of the adolescent girl with a rare authenticity. Probably best realized in 2003s ""Thirteen"" and at the core of 2008s ""Twilight"" the opening gambit in the current phenom it surfaces here in fits and starts. With an exceptional eye for the seductive power of an image cinematographer Mandy Walker (""Australia"") sets up the mystery from above. Its as if we are riding on the back of a hawk as it drifts silently above snow-covered mountains then a charming thatched roof village comes into view surrounded by a forest so dense that a woodcutter could chop wood forever. Once on the ground production designer Tom Sanders (""Saving Private Ryan"") and costume designer Cindy Evans who worked with Hardwicke on ""Thirteen"" have created a landscape and a look so ripe with possibility that you cant wait for someone to take a bite. Within this forest dark and deep the two ax men to watch for are Cesaire (Billy Burke) as a drunk of a father to Seyfrieds Valerie and the young hunk Peter played by Shiloh Fernandez (""Skateland"") whose eyes fairly crackle with mischief and menace. Though Valerie is smitten with Peter hes poor so Vs mom has someone else in mind. A marriage to the villages Richie Rich is arranged a that would be Henry (the scion of Jeremy Irons Max). Soon Miss Bright Eyes is being torn between the two and theres a bad moon rising. For this is a town in the stranglehold of a werewolf and this particular season of the wolf is the one in which his bite comes with transformative power for some death for others starting with Valeries sister. David Leslie Johnsons screenplay finds its ominous undertones in the earliest versions of the Red Riding Hood story a before the beast in Grandmas bonnet was defanged for modern childrens delicate sensitivities. The ""evil dwells among us"" premise is a fine one that has fueled many a thriller in countless imaginative ways (think ""Silence of the Lambs""). Its the dialogue that is problematic. Sometimes its literate and lofty as when the fire-and-brimstone Father Solomon (Gary Oldman in purple velvet) comes to rid the town of its wolf problem and remind us of how creative implements of torture can be. More of the time its mind-numbingly simplistic and served up on a platter like leftovers. That as much as the wolf is one of the great tragedies of this tale. The possibilities were there for the taking with the brilliant Julie Christie continuing a resurgence that began with 2006s ""Away From Her"" playing the grandmother as a bohemian herbalist living deep in the woods. ""Sideways"" lovely Virginia Madsen is Valeries eyes-on-the-prize driven mother. And Seyfried (""Mama Mia"" ""Letters to Juliet"") has more promise in her pout than a gaggle of her contemporaries combined. You have to wonder if Hardwicke cast Burke as an inside dig at ""Twilight"" where she chose him to play dad to Kristen Stewarts Bella or maybe hes just the teen father of choice these days. There is also a problem on the terror front. After Father Solomon throws suspicion on everyone what should have been skin-prickling rising-fear time a for the actors and for us a gets silly instead with everyones eyes getting their close-up. Oh my. Then theres the matter of the wolf with visual effects supervisor Jeffrey A. Okun in charge of making those hackles rise and those teeth dagger sharp.

By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune March 11 2011 -- 1052pm Warner Bros Amanda Seyfried in ""Red Riding Hood"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Red Riding Hood"" is entertainment for the village idiot. Year Once upon a time. Setting Backlot medieval village. Plot Valerie the woodsmans daughter yearns for brooding commoner while her parents push her toward a lad of high rank. Either may be the big bad wolf that is eating the neighbors. Quality Amateur night at the Renaissance Fair. Believe me you would have a better time chewing through a hardbound edition of the Brothers Grimm. This overstretched melee of fairy-tale tropes and Stephenie Meyer supernatural romance is a model of demographic targeting at its most cynical. Instead of creating a richly imagined world with its own hidden laws the filmmakers eliminated everything not calculated to appeal to 11- to 17-year-old females throwing out common sense imagination and craftsmanship in the bargain. Amanda Seyfried stars as plucky Valerie. The arch of her eyebrows the bow of her lips the Goldilocks tumble of her hair her pearl-white complexion are too too perfect. She looks like a product ordered direct from the Courtly Love website. Her acting here consists of opening her oversized eyes extra-wide and parting her lips in awestruck wonder. Since the marvels she encounters include a frowzy computer-generated wolf a population speaking in discordant American accents an absurd brass elephant/heretic pressure cooker and hammy witch-finder general Gary Oldman maybe this is pretty good acting after all. Valeries romantic rivals are poor Peter and wealthy Henry. They are played by Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons respectively but the actors and their roles are so generic as to be interchangeable. Most of the films players are stock caricatures with an occasional outre attribute. Oldmans clerical werewolf exterminator sports silver fingernails sharpened to dagger tips. Julie Christie as Vals granny growls her lines in a gruff ""Ill huff and Ill puff"" baritone that puts her under suspicion too. There are diverting eruptions of unintentional humor. In the wintertime scenes the snow underfoot is all too clearly sand. Val believes she is accursed because as a child she participated in killing a bunny rabbit which in most 16th-century villages would be called ""making lunch."" At one point Val suspected of sorcery is fitted with a snoutlike ""mask of humiliation"" and put on display in the village square. The headgear makes her look like a first cousin of TVs ""Alf."" RED RIDING HOOD 0 stars Rating PG-13 for violence and creature terror and some sensuality. The film represents a career-derailing misstep for Catherine Hardwicke a talented pro whose honest and frightening Southern California youth dramas ""Thirteen"" and ""The Lords of Dogtown"" landed her the job of directing ""Twilight."" Corrupted by that megahit she has turned away from her natural strength -- hard-eyed realism and empathy for the emotional caldron of modern teen life -- and toward mystical rubbish. There should be criminal penalties for this sort of thing. Instead this movie punishes audiences. Its a crazy world.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + They stagger toward us arms outstretched skin ashen hair immaculately gelled and mussed. Theyre desperate to separate teenage girls from their allowances but their souls are dead and their passion doth make one giggle. The zombie army of ""Twilight clones marches on with ""Red Riding Hood a laughably inept series of adolescent poses trying to pass itself off as a movie.Two weeks ago it was Alex Pettyfer as a hunky misunderstood alien prince in ""I Am Number Four and last week he returned as a hunky misunderstood teen ogre in ""Beastly. This week weve got werewolves with Amanda Seyfried doing her best to channel Bella and the anonymously handsome Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons as hunky misunderstood potential wolfboys. Its like Team Edward and Team Jacob except you cant tell the difference and you dont care. A fairy tale set in a chintzy overlit Dark Ages -- call it the Slightly Dim Ages -- ""Red Riding Hood makes you miss the stark realism of M. Night Shyamalans ""The Village.The surprise is that this strip-mall Renaissance Faire has been brought to the screen by Catherine Hardwicke who directed the original not-bad-at-all ""Twilight and who in movies like ""Thirteen and even ""The Nativity Story has shown she understands the wayward emotions that compel young women. Perhaps shes trying to fire up her own franchise to the point of bringing along Billy Burke the heroines father in ""Twilight as a good luck talisman. Maybe she should have hired Anna Kendrick instead.""Red Riding Hood takes place in a hamlet called Daggerhorn where its always snowing cornstarch and no ones ever cold. A ravenous beast has been stalking the land and after the sister of young virginal Valerie (Seyfried) is killed the villagers call in Father Solomon the local werewolf wrangler and witchfinder general. He is played by Gary Oldman with an accent that wanders from Transylvania to London and back and he is the most enjoyable part of this movie. Overacting has its privileges and Oldman knows exactly how to turn a turkey like this.When he isnt torturing the village idiot in a giant brass elephant Solomon warns the villagers that the beast walks among them. Is it Valeries true love the bad-boy woodcutter Peter (Fernandez)? Or perhaps its Henry (Irons) the good-guy blacksmith to whom shes unhappily engaged. No one is above suspicion including Valeries father (Burke) mother (Virginia Madsen) and grandmamma the latter played by Julie Christie in a schmatta. The legendary star takes the only sane approach to her role by acting as if shes in another movie entirely.Much of the plot is given over to Valeries romantic indecisions; at times ""Red Riding Hood plays like a very medieval episode of ""Gossip Girl complete with wild parties involving wenches hautboys and techno. Seyfried who can give good performances (""Mamma Mia) and painfully bland ones (""Letters to Juliet) errs on the drippy side here. My what big eyes she has and not nearly enough going on behind them.There is of course a massive amount of subtext to be mined from the ancient folk tale and everyone from the brothers Grimm to Bruno Bettelheim has had his way with it. ""Little Red Riding Hood flashes warning signals about adolescent sexuality and dangerous men about straying off the path versus heading straight to grandmas house. The film youre looking for is probably 1984s certifiably crazy ""The Company of Wolves with its Freudian psychology icky transformation scenes and Angela Lansbury as a malevolent granny warning Little Red to ""never trust a man whose eyebrows meet in the middle.Would that ""Red Riding Hood were even half that much fun. With the exception of one almost-roll in the hay and Oldman bellowing at Seyfried to ""put on your harlots robe the movie plays it dully safe hinting that Valerie has her wanton side but never following through. No maidenheads were harmed in the making of this movie which is doubtless how the target audience and their parents prefer it. For all the smolder movies in the ""Twilight genre keep their beasts chained safely in the basement. This one ends happily ever after for everyone but us. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Red Riding Hood Video Rated PG-13  100 minutes  2011 Like an idiot I came to this movie hoping that director Catherine Hardwicke--who made her debut with the controversial bad-girl drama Thirteen (2003)--might engage in a feminist interrogation of the old fairy tale just as French filmmaker Catherine Breillat has with Bluebeard (2009) and The Sleeping Beauty (2010). Instead this is a muddle-headed horror flick set in a medieval village that beefs up the five-minute childrens story with 95 minutes of werewolf tropes plot convolutions and heavy-breathing teen romance along the lines of Hardwickes last outing Twilight. Amanda Seyfried is the title character Julie Christie is her grandmother and Gary Oldman struts around as a crusading priest knowing full well that many viewers will be grateful to him just for showing up.

Then -- bummer -- Valeries sister is eaten by the werewolf that besieges their village thus forcing our heroine to weigh her own budding libidinal desires against supernatural forces beyond her control. Sound familiar? Directed by Twilight franchise launcher Catherine Hardwicke and shot on clunky-looking sets embellished with garish digital effects Red Riding Hood is a cheap attempt to cash in on that vampire series massive success. Red Riding Hood like the Twilight movies is geared to the just-pubescent demographic Hardwicke lovingly shoots a medieval bacchanal as if it were a movie prom while Valeries encounters with the CGI wolf are cartoonish when they should be chilling. Where the Twilight films play the material dead straight -- maybe the only way to sell the notion that a teenage crush could be epic life-or-death stuff is to refuse to admit that theres a joke to be in on -- Red Riding Hood veers between monotonous soapy seriousness (the bickering of the boy rivals various impassioned confessions) and camp (Julie Christies growling Grandmother Gary Oldmans bombastic professional wolf hunter -- who rides into town towing a giant iron elephant). Give credit where credit is due I guess Red Riding Hoods sequel-baiting ending breaks new ground in endorsing mortal danger as a teenage aphrodisiac.

"Red Riding Hood | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; red-riding-hood ) Red Riding Hood (United States 2011) March 10 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli At least the werewolves in Red Riding Hood have teeth and when in human form they dont parade around shirtless. Alas wearing the PG-13 like a Scarlet Letter the movie advertises an absence of true horror. Even Lon Cheney Jr.s Wolfman was scarier than the too-obviously CGI lycanthrope here. Still the material with the monster isnt the worst thing offered up by this ""re-telling"" of the popular childrens story - that label belongs to the dreaded love triangle which is so badly scribbled that it could have been lifted directly from the series in which director Catherine Hardwick recently toiled Twilight. Unlike the recent Beastly which made the catastrophic mistake of transferring Beauty and the Beast to modern-day America Red Riding Hood stays rooted in a medieval-style fantasy world in which the Church wields immense power and werewolves and witches exist. (Nick Cage visited a place like this in his recent box office bomb Season of the Witch.) In a village set in the midst of a great wilderness lives a young woman named Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) who is in love with a poor woodcutter named Peter (Shiloh Fernandez). Alas Valeries mother (Virginia Madsen) and father (Billy Burke) have betrothed her to the wealthy Henry (Max Irons) for whom she has little affection. Valerie who has a fondness for wearing a red cloak frequently visits her nearby grandmother (Julie Christie) but the older woman never weighs in about whether she prefers Luke or Henry. The love triangle fades into the background when the mauling of Valeries sister reveals that the dreaded werewolf of old has returned. The local priest summons master demon-hunter and lycanthrope-killer Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) who arrives prepared for battle. He doesnt have to wait long. Poor Amanda Seyfried. One of todays most lively and expressive young actresses she finds herself stuck between two lifeless pieces of wood. Both Shiloh Fernandez and Max Irons are animated mannequins evidencing no discernible acting talent to go along with their admitted good looks. One obvious similarity between Red Riding Hood and Twilight is that Hardwicke cares more about her male leads appearances than their thespian abilities. Gary Oldman may be on board to fill that void but hes in his over-the-top mode here not quite frothing at the mouth but coming close. His character inhabits a moral gray area but the script is too black-and-white to dwell on the complexity of his motivations. His Father Solomon is the most interesting character in the film but after he has been around for about 15 minutes the filmmakers forget that and set about turning him into a cookie-cutter bad guy. Red Riding Hood retains the framework of the childrens story but thats about all it keeps. This isnt the first time (nor will it likely be the last) when some of the ideas and themes of ""Little Red Riding Hood"" have been used in an adult fashion. The 1996 movie Freeway starring Kiefer Sutherland and Reese Witherspoon accomplished some infinitely more interesting variations than what we are presented with here. Red Riding Hood flounders in a limbo between fantasy and horror where the desire for widespread youth appeal restricts it from embracing the latter while the story arc limits its capabilities as the former. For a while Red Riding Hood unfolds like a mystery with the identity of the werewolf keeping us guessing. Several possibilities are immediately rejected but Hardwicke is adept at playing the red herring game without being too obvious. When the truth is unveiled its a little disappointing but not as disappointing as the lackluster climax and conclusion. Red Riding Hoods final five minutes are by far its worst although some of the ""passionate"" moments of the love triangle come close if only because of the gulf of talent existing between Seyfried and her co-stars. A sex scene is particularly awkward; she might as well have a dildo. Despite the films numerous failings Hardwicke displays mastery when it comes to atmosphere. Her camera sweeps majestically (the opening helicopter shot is impressive) and the sense of the villages isolation is imprinted on every frame. Excluding the silly CGI and the regrettable lack of blood and gore Red Riding Hood is a visually breathtaking motion picture (and is thankfully not available in 3-D). But the content does not aspire to anything close to the packaging. This is a beautifully wrapped box that contains only a tiny forgettable trinket. Maybe the Twilight crowd will appreciate it (although Im not sure about that) but its hard to imagine anyone else being impressed.

"Red Riding Hood (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Red Riding Hood (PG-13) Lame-brained attempt to turn fairy tale into a horror movie borders on the idiotic. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald3/10/2011 Editor rating 1 According to legend a silver bullet can kill a werewolf. Too bad it cant slay bad writing without which the ill-conceived Red Riding Hood would not exist. One in an upcoming and inexplicable series of movies based on fairy tales Red Riding Hood is baffling from the start an obvious attempt to cash in now that Edward and Bellas story is finally coming to an end on Twilight fans desperation for new supernatural love triangles starring oppressively attractive young people. The film is even by directed by Catherine Hardwicke who did a decent job with the first Twilight movie despite being burdened with the concept of sparkly vampires. Red Riding Hood makes that movie seem deep and nuanced. Its so silly and banal that not even the great Gary Oldmans scenery-chewing turn as a werewolf hunter can make it worth your time.The film stars Amanda Seyfried (Letters to Juliet) as medieval village girl Valerie who is betrothed to one pretty boy (Max Irons son of Jeremy) but in love with another (Shiloh Fernandez who would look more at home on 90210). Mom (Virginia Madsen; poor poor Virginia Madsen) has vetoed the guy her daughter likes because hes a woodcutter like Valeries dad (Billy Burke) which is apparently a big barrier to upward mobility. But there are bigger problems afoot The town is being terrorized by a rapacious wolf. (Its also being menaced by a purveyor of bad hair extensions but nobody seems too worried about that.) The townspeople have managed to appease the monster with prime livestock but the wolf reneges on this long-standing deal and kills Valeries sister. Enter the famous wolf hunter Father Solomon (Oldman) who informs everyone that this is no ordinary predator but a werewolf who walks as a man by day and could be anyone in the village. The characters begin asking each other ""Do you think Im the wolf?"" and Valeries grandmother (Julie Christie) spouts ye olde pithy sayings (""All sorrows are less with bread""). Later theres a medieval rave -- mead being the drug of choice -- that apparently makes the wolf really angry because he shows up and slaughters half the town. Before he flees he has a revealing conversation with Valerie. At this point youre pretty much longing for sparkly vampires. The whole enterprise is idiotic lacking even the winking tone that might make it bearable (Valeries ""what big eyes you have"" elicits groans not knowing chuckles). The story is so thin the filmmakers struggle mightily to stretch the running time. Oldman does his best Spanish Inquisition imitation making the movie seem even more like an old Monty Python sketch than it would otherwise. And Ive seen more convincing medieval villagers at the Renaissance Festival.Let Red Riding Hood be a lesson to all those trying to capitalize on fairy tales Sometimes the happy ending only comes when the movie is blessedly over.

"Red Riding Hood Who you calling little? | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRed Riding Hood Who you calling little?Amanda Seyfried stars in a new take on the fairy tale about the little girl in the red cloak thats aimed at the Twilight teens.Amanda Seyfried in Red Riding Hood a movie clearly aimed at young teens.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. March 10 2011 Red Riding Hood (out of 4) Starring Amanda Seyfried Gary Oldman and Billy Burke. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke. 139 minutes. Opens March 11 at major theatres. PG The fairy tale about the little girl in the red cloak confronted by a scheming wolf in Grandmas bed gets the whodunit treatment in Red Riding Hood Catherine Hardwickes artful Twilight-inspired tale of medieval mystery and teen romance. Set in a land as artificially lovely as a Thomas Kinkade painting theres nothing ""little"" about Red anymore. Pillow-lipped gamine Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia) is red-cloaked Valerie who is torn between her longtime crush the brooding-yet-hunky poor woodsman Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) and wealthy blacksmith Henry (Max Irons) who is her parents choice for her husband-to-be and also something of a stone fox. But its not foxes that are uppermost in Valeries mind and those of the villagers of Daggerhorn. Its keeping the bloodthirsty wolf -- a werewolf to be precise -- at bay a rampaging carnivore that terrorizes the town during every full moon. After being satisfied with piglets left as midnight snacks the wolf has claimed a human victim -- Valeries younger sister leaving her parents (Virginia Madsen and Twilights Billy Burke) to mourn. Worse its the season of the blood moon which means the werewolf can recruit a new acolyte by means of a bite. Brave self-confident Valerie is concerned about family and honour but has enough of a bad-girl streak in her to keep her interesting. She worries about her grandmother (a youthful Julie Christie looking like a sexy Rasta with long blond dreads trailing down her back) an odd duck who lives alone in the woods her A-frame surrounded by spiked trees and swirling snow. Better send for a werewolf hunter suggests gullible village priest Father Auguste (Inceptions Lukas Haas) and who better than the famous Father Solomon? Played with zeal by Gary Oldman (Dracula the Harry Potter series) the purple-robed prelate arrives in a fancy carriage with a pair of African bodyguards packing medieval heat and a pair of horses towing a life-sized bronze elephant whose sinister purpose will be known soon. As the vain and pompous Solomon Oldman is the highlight of Red Riding Hood a reminder of Alan Rickmans amusingly evil Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. He tells the villagers a chilling tale of how he discovered werewolves reside in human form during the day. Suddenly everybody is a suspect and things long kept secret will be revealed. With Solomon stirring the pot even Valerie starts to doubt the loyalty of those she loves the most. Why is Peter suddenly being such a pill? And whats Grandma been up to alone in the woods? Hardwicke helms Red Riding Hood with a clear vision for her target audience young teens. Theres violence but little blood some chaste sexy bits and a few swift scares. David Leslie Johnson (Orphan) uses sly humour throughout his screenplay. Three little pigs show up in one scene; and yes you will hear ""the better to see you with my dear"" and a chorus about not fearing the big bad wolf. Adults will find this version of the classic cautionary tale to be slow in parts but this movie isnt for us and Hardwicke -- who gave life to the Twilight franchise with her successful take on the first book -- smartly sticks to her plan. Haunting and edgy pop sounds from Swedish band Fever Ray (The Knifes singer Karin Dreijer Andersson) keep the ancient tale in the present while the door is left open to the suggestion of a sequel another chapter in the story of a young woman who has more in her basket than goodies for granny when shes determined to keep the wolf from the door.

Red Riding Hood Poor Director Catherine Hardwicke. Cast Amanda Seyfried Gary Oldman Shiloh Fernandez. Rating PG-13 for violence and creature terror and some sensuality. Our heroine is Catherine Hardwicke whose credits included ""Thirteen"" and ""Lords of Dogtown"" before she kicked off the ""Twilight"" franchise directing the first film in the series. She was gone by the second one but not before creating a signature look and um feel for the films. If by chance youve missed ""Twilight"" and its sequels dont worry. Shiny moody moon-faced and dumb ""Red Riding Hood"" pretty much replicates the experience entirely. This is not a good thing. Young beautiful girl falls for one boy but is pursued by another all set against a silly supernatural backdrop. Substitute a woodsman for the vampire love interest and a blacksmith for the werewolf rival and youre up to speed. Oh theres a werewolf here too but were getting ahead of the story. Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) lives in the village of Daggerhorn where all her life she has pined for Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) who grows up to be a woodcutter. (He should take an ax to the wooden line readings.) However Valeries family has arranged an engagement to the relatively better-off blacksmith Henry (Max Irons) who seems like a nice fellow but just doesnt excite her the way Peter does. Not quite Team Peter and Team Henry maybe but awfully close. If the connections werent clear enough old faithful Billy Burke is on hand as Cesaire Valeries father - he also plays Bellas dad in ""Twilight."" Its your typical small-village love triangle really except for the werewolf who has been hanging around for a couple of generations. He shows up every full moon to kill the sacrifice the townspeople offer usually a pig or something. But one night the werewolf kills Valeries sister and the townspeople panic. A search party hunts down and kills a wolf - yay or so they think - just before the arrival of Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) who would be a Van Helsing type if you got the idea screenwriter David Johnson had ever read ""Dracula."" He brings along a small army a nifty torture device and an enormous amount of paranoia and gloom. You havent killed the werewolf he explains because he doesnt live in the woods. He walks among you. The villages response? Party (Really.) Of course Solomon is proved right and from there its a matter of figuring out who the werewolf is. Peter? Henry? Valeries creepy grandmother (Julie Christie)? And in case you were wondering yes we get the ""what big eyes you have"" bit. Seyfried is a talented actress a much more expressive romantic lead than Kristen Stewart in ""Twilight."" (Valerie is also much more of a take-charge character than Bella and thankfully so.) Oldman hams it up to a comical degree but at least hes having fun. Fernandez and Irons on the other hand are bland presences something you realize when they disappear from time to time and you dont really notice theyre gone. ""Red Riding Hood"" looks good the snowy village and forest appropriately menacing. And there is a sort of unintentional campy fun to be had in places. Just dont go in expecting much in other words and perhaps youll live happily ever after. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

By the time the title character gets pawed by an eager young lad growling ""I could eat you up"" its clear that this isnt your grandmothers ""Red Riding Hood."" More like your teenage daughters as director Catherine Hardwicke stays firmly in ""Twilight"" territory with another moony-eyed romantic triangle beset by hellish supernatural complications. Intermittently enjoyable hokum at best this mostly risible exercise in fairy-tale revisionism could stoke enough young-femme curiosity to post solid if not ""Twilight""-threatening numbers its tepid dramatics clumsy production values and cupboardful of werewolf cliches be damned. Reimagining a legend already subject to innumerable changes over the centuries the script by David Leslie Johnson (""Orphan"") superficially recalls Tim Burtons ""Sleepy Hollow"" in the way it spins a classic tale into a convoluted whodunit cloaked in small-town superstition and religious paranoia though ""Red Riding Hood"" lacks the earlier films visual mastery and rich sense of time and place. Seeming willfully anachronistic one moment distracted and fuzzy-headed the next the film unfolds in what looks like a medieval European village populated by characters with names like Valerie and Roxanne played by actors who make no effort to hide their flat American intonations when they say things like ""Youd better watch yourself."" Yup youd better do just that in the isolated hamlet of Daggerhorn whose residents have kept a big bad you-know-what at bay for generations by making regular livestock sacrifices. But with the arrival of the red ""blood moon"" which apparently occurs once in a blue moon the wolf has broken the covenant by claiming the life of a young maiden to the devastation of her parents (Virginia Madsen and ""Twilights"" Billy Burke) and her beautiful crimson-cloaked sister Valerie (Amanda Seyfried). The body count escalates as does the collective sense of panic with the arrival of famed lycanthropy expert Father Solomon (Gary Oldman) who warns the villagers that the werewolf dwells among them. When Valerie learns with a shock that she can communicate with the monster she figures it must be someone close to her -- possibly her longtime sweetheart Peter (Shiloh Fernandez); her unloved fiance Henry (Max Irons); or even her grandmother played with alternately sweet and sinister overtones by Julie Christie. Suspicion falls on each principal character like clockwork yielding plenty of er red herrings en route to a solution contrived with a modicum of cleverness. Yet apart from this rigged puzzle the picture feels under-realized in almost every respect from its viscerally unsatisfying setpieces to a bland romantic melodrama that suggests a poor mans Bella Edward and Jacob. Seyfried and Fernandez enjoy a few stolen kisses and a chaste roll in the hay but the film never tries to plumb its sources psychosexual depths in the manner of say Angela Carters ""The Company of Wolves"" (filmed by Neil Jordan in 1984). Hardwicke has shot down the rumor that she was axed from the ""Twilight"" series but given her choice of follow-up material one cant help but wonder if she was at least partly motivated by the opportunity to wrestle with werewolves on the bigscreen. Alas the films action chops leave much to be desired and one never gets a really good look at the wolf itself -- a shadowy computer-generated blur that by dint of a PG-13 rating is responsible for some of the more bloodless attacks in monster-movie history all shock cuts slashing sound effects and the occasional severed hand. The rare actress who can appear angelic and devilish in the same frame the luminous Seyfried would seem ideally cast as a sweetly corruptible Red Riding Hood but the film is loath to jeopardize the viewers rooting interest by making her an especially rich or complicated heroine. Oldman playing an obvious caricature of fire-and-brimstone hysteria nonetheless brings some declamatory showmanship and an interesting quasi-Slavic accent to the communitys otherwise bland diction. Theres something to be said for allowing actors to speak and emote in their natural patois in a fairy-tale context but here it serves merely to point up the general absence of magic. Despite the striking motif of Valerie running up the mountainside her red cloak trailing behind her in brilliant contrast with the snow the films widescreen lensing of well-mounted Vancouver sets often looks too artificially doctored; occasional gauzy soft-focus intrusions are less redolent of timeless fantasy than of nature-themed beauty commercials. The anachronistic approach is borne out by a soundtrack that shudders with emo-pop and whispery voiceover all the better to lure a contempo audience with my dear.

TWITTER Amanda Seyfried stars as the title character with Shiloh Fernandez as her love interest in the David Leslie Johnson-penned film opening in theaters Friday. A film of grimm banality Red Riding Hood puts a bloodthirsty Twilight spin on a fairy tale already possessed of an unusually macabre climax. As it thuds along from one wolf attack to the next Catherine Hardwickes first film since taking leave of Bella and her toothy friends adamantly refuses to provide any wit humor or fun concerning itself mostly with the heroines taxing dilemma of picking between the rural villages two best looking boys. Still with Warner Bros. delivering a massive campaign aimed at a ready-and-drooling target audience some big opening numbers lie in wait. Red Riding Hood is in the vanguard of what appears to be an onslaught of live-action fairy tale-derived studio features over the next year or so. What triggered this trend remains unclear but one can only hope that the level of cleverness and invention improves as things hardly get off to an inspired start here. Restricting the action almost entirely to a small Ruritanian community where everyone but the visiting Gary Oldman speaks in mundane American accents the script by David Leslie Johnson (Orphan) pivots on two central creative ploys -- to turn a mere wolf into a werewolf and to transform the ancient story into a whodunnit in which the lovely young Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) must figure out who among the locals nocturnally mutates into the massive black hound that killed her sister and converses to her hoping shell run away with it. Is it Peter (Shiloh Fernandez) the cute but poor woodcutter who has been her true love since childhood and himself would love to take her away? Might it possibly be his rival Henry (Max Irons) the prosperous blacksmith Valeries mother (Virginia Madsen) has arranged for her to marry? Could it be Dad (Billy Burke the sad-sack father from ""Twilight"") who boozes it up with regularity? Or heaven forbid is the wolf perhaps Grandma herself (Julie Christie) a bohemian eccentric who lives on her own out in the forest and has yellowish-brown eyes quite like those of the wolf itself? Officially taking charge of the case once the wolf begins attacking humans for the first time in 20 years is Father Solomon (Oldman) an itinerant werewolf hunter in clerics robes who resembles his Biblical namesake far less than he does Torquemada so convinced is he that his inquisitional techniques can elicit a confession of lycanthropy. As in Thirteen The Nativity Story and Twilight before it Red Riding Hood allows Hardwicke to focus on the emotional trials of a teenager thrust unceremoniously onto the rocks of extreme grown-up dilemmas and feeling her way toward solutions. Unfortunately the context here is hokier than in any of the directors previous films and as shes not a stylist or genre specialist she has little to bring to this sort of material other than a natural empathy for the lead character. The dialogue exchanges possess no spark the action is indifferently covered by random camera moves and cuts and the only jolts are provoked by cheap shock-cuts to the growling or roaring wolf. The only memorable image is the fortunately frequently appearing one of Seyfried with her blond hair flowing from beneath the eponymous scarlet cloak that matches her pillow lips. Otherwise the young actress has seen better days than this before and assuredly will again. The local men are boringly one-note but the casting of Christie was smart as she bestows her iconoclastic spirit upon the ambiguous grandma. The Vancouver-shot production mostly confined to a studio set has a rather dreary look spiced here and there by unusual production and costume design details that lend modern touches.
