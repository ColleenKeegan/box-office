Bewildering though it may seem Zathura is just that. Two young brothers chance across a board game with untapped mystical powers which once play begins transports their house into outer space and barrages them with sci-fi cliches. Ten-year-old Walter (Josh Hutcherson) and his cute-as-pie younger brother Danny (the aptly named Jonah Bobo) are the protagonists the latter coming across like a male counterpoint to devil-child Dakota Fanning. While Zathura is certainly aimed at a younger audience older viewers may enjoy the lovingly wrought 50s iconography of rocket ships aliens robots and ray guns which hark back to the likes of Forbidden Planet. And notwithstanding the plots basic unoriginality director Jon Favreau (Made Elf) gratifyingly prevents the film from becoming a mere maelstrom of CG effects by pushing the brothers amusing bickering to the fore the impulsive my-turn/ your-turn narrative supplies the same giddy charm that a couple of banana daiquiris might lend to a game of snakes and ladders.

"Zathura Plays Well on the Big Screen washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Zathura Plays Well on the Big Screen One wrong move and . . .  Josh Hutcherson and Jonah Bobo discover a games broader implications in ""Zathura."" (By Merrick Morton -- Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 11 2005 Remember that summer vacation when it just poured? Dad had paid a small ransom -- as he kept muttering over his pre-noon beer -- for that perfect beach house. And now it was bucketing. Thats when someone pulled out the dusty board game Tokens cards and dice spilled out before a circle of grumpy faces. Then everyone in spite of themselves got caught up in the game -- hooting and high-fiving slowly slipping into the warm waters of familial goodwill. ""Zathura"" salutes the low-tech magic that lurks inside a board game -- that hidden ability to bring people together. Although director Jon Favreau employs an arsenal of modern weapons -- digital effects miniature models robots and computer-generated imagery -- he makes sure the technology never overruns the story or its characters. The movie based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg (also author of ""Polar Express"" and ""Jumanji"") introduces us to 6-year-old Danny (Jonah Bobo) and 10-year-old Walter (Josh Hutcherson) who live in a constant state of war with their sullen older sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart). When their divorced father (Tim Robbins) is unexpectedly called to work one day he asks Lisa to run the house. She locks herself upstairs. The boys battle downstairs. Its another day in sibling hell. Walter gets so exasperated with Danny that at one point he loads him into a dumbwaiter and lowers him to the basement. Thats when Danny discovers Zathura an old-fashioned board game mostly made of tin with a windup key a lever a ""Go"" button and a miniature spaceship that whirs along the game board. Failing to get his brother interested Danny starts it up himself. That little spaceship springs to life and -- ding -- up pops a card with a message ""Meteor Shower -- Take Evasive Action."" Moments later the house is being bombarded with real meteors. Looking through the burning Swiss cheese that is now their roof the brothers realize they are intergalactic passengers in their own home -- which has been propelled into outer space. They have no choice but to continue playing the game. As in ""Jumanji"" each turn yields a very real surprise -- often unpleasant. Lisa is plunged into a cryonic sleep for five turns. A robot invades the house programmed erroneously to destroy them -- or so the cue card tells them. Flesh-eating Zorgons (reptilian bipedal aliens) pursue the floating house in their own spaceships and these guys are hungry . And an astronaut (Dax Shepard) who has been trapped in the nethersphere of this game for years literally drops in. (To the brothers disgust Lisa finally awakened from her involuntary slumber develops a crush on this stranger. ) It wont surprise you to hear its going to take a lot of sibling camaraderie for Danny Walter and Lisa to get their house back home. Or that Favreau who first appeared on the scene as writer-star of 1996s ""Swingers"" and most recently directed ""Elf"" engenders an amusing improvisatory atmosphere among the performers. They persuasively convey the familys domestic feistiness with screaming battles that reach such a pitch at times they forget the hostile forces around them. ""Zathura"" has an almost antique charm recalling the 1950s sci-fi movies in which actors in silver suits pretended to be aliens or those old Ray Harryhausen films such as 1963s ""Jason and the Argonauts"" in which ancient warriors fought herky-jerky monsters on studio back lots. The Zathura game looks like something hauled out of a Cold War-era basement. This hand-made feel gives ""Zathura"" an appealing childlike sense of wonder an element too often forgotten in movies with many times the budget and technological resources. By comparison the 1995 movie ""Jumanji"" whose plot is remarkably similar (preteen boy plays and gets swallowed into a board game for 26 years) has such stunning spectacles as rhinos zebras and elephants thundering through a household hallway but its characters and story seem like afterthoughts. Favreau clearly understands that the importance of a board game isnt in its fancy bells and whistles. Its measured by the people who play it and the fun it gives them. Zathura (102 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mild profanity. And those Zorgons might be too scary for young children.

Starring Josh Hutcherson Jonah Bobo and Tim Robbins. Directed by Jon Favreau. (PG. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Tales of kids left home alone have a built-in appeal to young audiences plugging into a common fantasy of wild fun to be had when there are no killjoy adults around to interfere. In the spirited ""Zathura"" brothers wind up with the run of their dads creaky house after their older sister who was instructed to supervise them falls asleep on the job. Although ""Zathura"" doesnt stint on special effects in creating the havoc that results what makes the movie truly special is its old-fashioned style like tuning into ""The Twilight Zone."" The movie harks back to a time before state-of-the-art technology when writers and directors had to rely mostly on imagination. There are some first-rate imaginations at work here beginning with Chris Van Allsburg whose childrens books ""Jumanji"" ""The Polar Express"" and now ""Zathura"" have turned out to be naturals for the big screen. Fresh from directing his first breakaway hit ""Elf"" Jon Favreau delivers a movie that will delight both kids -- the ones I took to a screening could barely contain their excitement -- and adults. He signals that this will be a cool experience for all by displaying a poster of Steve McQueen in ""Bullitt"" on a wall in the house. The action is set off by something in the basement. Rummaging through piles of junk 6-year-old Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson) -- the older sibling by four years an eon at their age -- uncover a simple-looking metal board game the worse for wear. What could be more 20th century than that? Except as the brothers discover this game offers a portal into the future. The object is to reach the planet Zathura advancing through cards ejected after each move. The alternative is to be stuck in a neverland somewhere in outer space. Unlike chess no time is allowed to strategize. A card appears warning ""Meteor shower take evasive action"" and the boys look up to see volcanic meteors coming their way. Armageddon arrives in the form of Zorgons lizard-like aliens bent on destroying everything in sight. Amazingly Sis continues to sleep through all of this until in one of the films great comic images she becomes frozen as the result of a wrong move. ""Zathura"" can be enjoyed solely as a sci-fi adventure. But it also sneaks in a couple of messages for those receptive to them. Sibling rivalry makes it almost impossible for the brothers to cooperate even when their lives depend upon it. Avoiding the staginess of many child actors Bobo and Hutcherson are very good at showing this natural antagonism. All Danny wants is for Walter to pay attention to him and acknowledge his accomplishments. But Walter thinks that to do so would somehow diminish his status as the older one. The game teaches him otherwise. A divorce has forced the boys to shuttle between their mother and father which they are none too happy about. Tim Robbins makes a brief but memorable appearance as their father who tries to make amends for the breakup of the family. By the movies end Danny and Walter come to realize -- as Dorothy and E.T. did before them -- that theres no place like home even if its a broken one.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Did board-game sales plummet after the terrors of ""Jumanji""? Its hard to imagine any kid rolling the dice for ""Monopoly"" after the unrelenting brutality of marauding elephants and screeching monkeys in Chris Van Allsburgs chilling tale. But one of the rules of Hollywood is that movie kids never learn from watching other movies. So 10 years after ""Jumanji"" a new duo of bickering siblings discovers a dusty old board game called ""Zathura"" and the resulting destruction makes ""Doom"" look like ""Candyland."" Children seem to love the concept at least the half-dozen I took with me to help calibrate my cynic-meter. Ranging from 10 to 13 the junior previewers each found something to love in ""Zathura A Space Adventure"" and demanded a glowing review. Glowing may be a bit much from a parent feeling assaulted by meteor showers and mindless Zorgons. But Id have to agree that ""Zathura"" is a rousing tale with an agreeable balance of fear and teachable moments the kind of adventure story that seems old-fashioned these days. Van Allsburg is an expert at spooking kids to the verge of downright meanness. The robo-elves of ""The Polar Express"" turned the North Pole into a Stepford factory town. ""Jumanji"" made you wonder how often the beloved author was left alone in childhood to unhappy ends. ""Zathura"" pulls back a bit from that precipice. Two brothers bicker relentlessly as their dad (Tim Robbins) tries to work at home on a quiet Saturday afternoon. The boys hate their creaky old house - though parents will salivate over the triple-wide Craftsman- style bungalow that co-stars. Danny and Walter hate their parents divorce and they seem to hate each other. In a nice touch no one even acknowledges the presence of a self-absorbed 15-year-old sister until shes awakened at 2 p.m. for emergency service. Younger brother Danny (Jonah Bobo) finds a forgotten board game called Zathura and starts to play the space adventure. Disdainful older brother Walter (Josh Hutcherson) grows interested when the house is suddenly pelted by burning meteors and floats into outer space. Like ""Jumanji"" the problem with ""Zathura"" is that danger piles upon danger without progression logic or point. The kids have no control over their destiny merely waiting in horror for the next assault. ""Zathura"" softens the approach with a slacker astronaut portrayed nicely by Dax Shepard. He has been stuck in the game for a while and knows to finish his salami sandwich before getting overheated about the latest Zorgon attack. Some of the set pieces stretch on far too long with each conclusion telegraphed well in advance. ""Zathura"" is painfully stretched and should have come in at a speedier 80 minutes. But screenwriter David Koepp hits realistic notes and positions the family for comeuppance. ""All I know"" Danny trembles ""is when we play this game bad things happen."" True except for a movie that your kids will probably appreciate.

"A bizarre world that screams out only to kids - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW A bizarre world that screams out only to kids By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  November 11 2005 Rarely is a movie audience asked to put up with so much noise for such a thankless payoff as it must with Zathura"" a loud endless family picture directed by the actor Jon Favreau. The kids around me whooped and hollered along with the movie so it might be profitable. And for pre-adolescents the action probably has a kick.Two squabbling brothers discover an antique mechanical board game called Zathura. It spits out cards that come destructively true when read aloud. One card sends their big house into outer space where in order to get back to earth they have to keep playing.Theres a killer robot killer meteors killer slimy lizard aliens and to provide adult supervision an ineffectual astronaut. The movie also tosses in some mild foul language and one dumb sexual situation involving the boys randy teen sister an unwitting passenger in the house.Twenty years ago Goonies"" which was also full of booby traps and rambunctious antics delighted kids of similar ages to those meant for Zathura."" (I was one of them.) Goonies"" had jokey characters with personalities and a suspenseful plot. Zathura"" could end on at least three separate occasions but drags on.If the movie sounds like that Robin Williams fantasy vehicle Jumanji"" from 10 years ago thats because both have been taken from childrens stories by Chris Van Allsburg who also wrote The Polar Express."" Zathura"" is the least of the three movies because it abandons us with two of the most intolerable children to make it onto a movie screen.They are a blooming jock named Walter (Josh Hutcherson) and Danny the meek kid brother he teases (Jonah Bobo). The movie has them perform one inane task after the next. This may be to keep the story in motion and special effects coming but the whole experience is like being trapped in a great big Happy Meal. (The sister is also a pain but she spends half the movie cryogenically frozen.)Favreau whos not in the film is a smart and engaging actor. But hes not as generous when hes directing. Both young actors demonstrate a talent for violently screaming at each other for minutes on end and nothing else. Or else theyre delivering lines right out of schoolyard recess. When Walter discovers the robot he commands it Get me a juice box bee-yatch""Neither boy exhibits the pluck or cleverness that sometimes can sweep you up in a middling adventure. Instead they continue the whining and bickering that probably began after their parents divorced. Tim Robbins plays the loving workaholic dad; we dont see moms face as she never even bothers to climb out of an SUV. Walter may blame Danny for the split but clearly the movie thinks the divorce is her fault that bee-yatch.Divorce is not whats put the brothers at each others throats for most of Zathura.""

That figures because Zathura trudges back to the well of kids-fantasy author Chris Van Allsburg who also wrote The Polar Express. Intergalactic adventure Their house goes flying into space after Josh Hutcherson left and Jonah Bobo spin the numbers of an old board game. Columbia Pictures Thanks in part to its over-reliance on special effects the result seems all too familiar. In a suburban broken home an older brother treats his sibling so wretchedly that they belong in a John Hughes comedy. Upstairs theres a snitty older sister in pajama shorts taking a day-long slumber. All are angry at their dad -- what an ogre he has to work -- so the boys are reduced to twirling the spinner on an old board game that apparently hasnt been used in years. Suddenly Zathura Were in a new universe. Those are eye-level stars not Munchkins we suddenly see out the front door. About the movie Zathura   (out of four) Stars Jonah Bobo Josh Hutcherson Dax Shepard Kristen Stewart Tim Robbins Director Jon Favreau Distributor Columbia Pictures Rating PG for fantasy action and peril and some language Running time 1 hour 53 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Once director Jon Favreau sets up the premise -- and does it ever take a lot of brotherly put-downs to accomplish this -- he doesnt have a deep talent pool to help him out. At least Jumanji had Robin Williams (before he got overexposed) Kirsten Dunst Bonnie Hunt Bebe Neuwirth and a funny David Alan Grier. And Favreaus Elf had Will Ferrell (before he got overexposed) and charming Zooey Deschanel. Zathura serves up an astronaut and the OK plot twist he brings plus the surprise cryogenic freezing of the snoozer upstairs. (Kids -- even Ted Williams kid -- dont try this on sis at home.) As for the storys suspense hook it stems from whether the three males will spin the right combination of numbers to get back home to what is now a very messy house. Any guesses? Josh Hutcherson and Jonah Bobo are cast as the older and younger brothers and Dax Shepard strikes the authoritatively warm right chord as the astronaut. Kristen Stewart plays the sister and if this were a Brian De Palma movie wed see her relentlessly taunt her high school classs homeliest math whiz before getting impaled in the finale. Tim Robbins plays the working dad and the movie misses him once he bails out early. After seeing Robbins as that sad sad case whose troubles led to an Oscar in Mystic River its nice to see the actor in a tree-filled front yard playing catch with the boys.

Zathura Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2005) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/zathura-2005,200,zathura12,zathura,rogerebert
"Zathura | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; zathura ) Zathura (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Calling Zathura the ""space version of Jumanji"" wouldnt be far off. Like the 1995 film this movie is based on a childrens book by celebrated author Chris Van Allsburg in which a group of people plays an amazing board game. (Van Allsburg doesnt always write about games - he also penned The Polar Express.) In Jumanji each turn brought a new herd of stampeding wild animals into a quiet suburban neighborhood. In Zathura the participants are blasted into outer space and can only return to terra firma once a winner has been declared. Admittedly as was the case with Jumanji the material is a little thin for a full-length feature. Yet director Jon Favreau and screenwriters David Koepp and John Kamps do a better job making the conversion than the creative team behind Jumanji. Theres a lot more energy and excitement here and although the premise is essentially the same developments seem less forced. A lot of that has to do with character development. In Jumanji the players were two-dimensional pawns. In Zathura theyre real people. The dialogue in the film is perfect - this is exactly how brothers interact at a certain age. Walter Budwing (Josh Hutcherson) and his younger brother Danny (Jonah Bobo) are typical siblings - rivals in almost everything including capturing the attention of their father (Tim Robbins) who splits his time between playing catch with the boys and working overtime. One Saturday Dad goes to the office leaving Walter and Danny behind under the less-than-watchful-eye of their older sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart). Her cardinal rule dont wake me unless the house is burning down. While poking around in the basement Danny finds an old board game called ""Zarutha."" He wants to play; Walter wants to watch ESPN. But when Danny starts tinkering with the game strange things happen. A meteor shower devastates the living room. Lisa ends up in cryogenic sleep. An astronaut appears out of nowhere. And the house is in orbit around Saturn. Its a killer view but it puts the Budwings in danger from the lizard-like Zorgons. The only way back to normalcy is to win the gamea| provided the board isnt destroyed in one of numerous freak occurrences. Zathura will work better for younger viewers than older ones. Theres not much plot to absorb and theres plenty of action so this is the kind of spectacle that will appeal to those without long attention spans. For adults there are moments of genuine suspense and a nice twist or two (nothing too fancy). The action is standard-order science fiction stuff but its handled well by Favreau so it never feels too derivative. The visuals are eye-popping - lots of pretty scenery and theres never an instance when the CGI comes across as cheap or silly. Theres also a nostalgia element to Zathura. This is a movie for everyone who remembers playing this sort of old clunky board game. Its vintage 50s when ""high tech"" represented a wind-up gadget. Watching the kids play I was reminded of some of the ""treasures"" I found in the recesses of a closet in my grandparents house. The only difference is that when I started tinkering with one of those games I did not end up in the middle of an intergalactic war. At the heart of Zathura is the relationship that deepens between the brothers as the movie develops. For Walter Danny starts out as a pest always following him around and cramping his style. On more than one occasion he wishes Danny hadnt been born. Then sometime during their intergalactic journey he discovers things he never suspected about his brother. Lisas presence (curtailed for a while by her cryogenic nap) adds another element to the sibling interaction. Unlike Jumanji Zathura is a complete movie-going experience. And its suitable for the entire family (although young children may be frightened by the Zorgons who are scary-looking). The simplicity of the plot is a strength and weakness but Favreaus sure-handed direction does a good job of obscuring how little meat exists on the bones of the story. Zathura is welcome late-year fun for all ages - a pleasant contrast to the nauseating dreck that normally masquerades as family-friendly science fiction. (Clockstoppers Thunderbirdsa| need I go on?)

Hes good at it and we need more of them -- more than we need say another Elf which felt like an honest kids movie trying to wriggle out of a grown hipsters tight-fitting irony. Zathura is far more at ease with itself as it hurtles purposefully through the starlit void of encroaching adulthood. Like its sister picture 1995s Jumanji Zathura is based on a Chris Van Allsburg picture book about two siblings drawn bodily into the perilous world of a vintage board game. Unlike Jumanji (or last years The Polar Express another Van Allsburg adaptation) Zathura isnt concerned with breaking any new ground in the field of visual effects; it trusts Van Allsburgs storytelling instead of trying to amp up the whispering vividness of his artistry. The tale is simple enough Squabbling brothers Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson) must learn teamwork in order to navigate their house back from the far reaches of the galaxy. Favreau manages to elevate this potentially trite setup into Cain and Abel territory without ever overstepping the genres bounds or gunning the thrusters into Cartoon Network hyperdrive. From a Hollywood that often settles for less in the family department Zathura is a rarity a stellar fantasy that faces down childhood anxieties with feet-on-the-ground maturity.

Its unwieldy title notwithstanding ""Zathura A Space Adventure"" is arguably the best adaptation of a Chris Van Allsburg book to date. A visually resplendent adventure about two brothers and an enchanted board game that beams them into outer space Sonys unofficial follow-up to its 1995 hit ""Jumanji"" benefits from helmer Jon Favreaus amiably low-key sense of humor and assured handling of well-trod emotional territory. Absent the star power of a Robin Williams or a ""Jumanji""-sized marketing push pricey pic looks to draw midrange rather than astronomical numbers with better prospects in ancillary. As evidenced in both ""Jumanji"" and Warner Bros. ""The Polar Express"" the main obstacle to wresting Van Allsburgs gorgeously imagined picture books onto the screen -- aside from the authors ineffable tone of deadpan surrealism -- has been their lack of a feature-length narrative. Yet aside from the occasional lapse in pacing screenwriters David Koepp and John Kamps sustain attention for a full 101 minutes without departing significantly from the slender 32-page framework of Van Allsburgs story. Ten-year-old Walter (Josh Hutcherson) and 6-year-old Danny (Jonah Bobo) compete for the attention of their stressed-out father (Tim Robbins in a brief but effective turn). After Dad takes off putting their negligent older sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart) in charge Danny finds himself stuck in the basement where he digs up a 50s-style space-themed board game called Zathura. Danny begins to play the game an ingenious wind-up contraption that comes with self-moving pieces and a metal turnkey in lieu of rolling dice. It soon becomes clear however -- after an impromptu meteor shower in the living room -- that self-operation is the least of the games properties. In a surreally entrancing shot that consciously echoes both ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" Danny opens the front door to find their house hovering not too far from what appear to be the rings of Saturn. The brothers soon realize they must finish the game to get home safely and subsequent turns of the key trigger an attack by a giant robot (voiced by Frank Oz); a cryonic freeze that leaves Lisa hilariously immobilized; and an invasion by a fleet of carnivorous lizardlike aliens called Zorgons. Along the way they pick up a free-floating astronaut (Dax Shepard) who helps keep the Zorgons at bay and in a clever but foreseeable twist fits neatly into the escalating emotional drama between the two siblings. For their part Hutcherson and Bobo excel at delivering scripts peppy banter while coming across as real live kids their angry exchanges veering only occasionally into melodramatic excess. ""Zathura"" cleaves in broad strokes to the ""Jumanji"" formula (two tykes play a game that teaches them life lessons while systematically destroying their house) but in every way reps a smarter less mean-spirited and more purposeful picture than its decade-old predecessor. Still the action -- replete with explosions fireballs gravity fields black holes and other situations the average 10-year-old likely would not survive -- is anything but a faithful approximation of Van Allsburgs minimalist style and may prove a mite too intense for extremely young auds. Pics otherworldly setting and sentimental themes of family reconciliation place it squarely in the mold of early Steven Spielberg as does John Debneys score with backup vocals by a choir of angels who work a bit too hard to cultivate a sense of childlike wonder. Favreaus first post-""Elf"" directing project finds him very much at ease with the challenges of a larger-scale more action-oriented family film. Relying heavily but not too heavily on CG effects helmer displays a wizardly command of the house interiors keeping the action tightly focused sometimes to the point of claustrophobia with only brief cutaways to the staggering sights just outside the window.
