"Kids Behaving Badly washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Kids Behaving Badly Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 6 2004 ITS A GOOD thing the intended audience for ""Catch That Kid"" -- a tepid comic adventure in which a trio of likable but felonious middle-schoolers try to steal 250000 -- is too young to have seen most of its myriad precedents which include everything from ""Robin Hood"" to ""Sneakers"" to the recent remake of ""The Italian Job."" For those with a few more movies under their belt though the formulaic Pee Wee League bank-heist film offers little in the way of originality real excitement or even genuinely transgressive behavior. The most criminal thing about it? Its reliance on tired stock characters and plot grooves so well worn the entire movie could use a shot of Botox. It even contains the line ""We are sooo grounded"" a creaky quip by one of its preteen protagonists that is by now so overused that it sounds like something only an adult as nerdy as I am would say. Speaking of adults with the exception of the three leads -- Kristen Stewart as 12-year-old ringleader Maddy and Corbin Bleu and Max Thieriot as her romantically smitten criminal accomplices -- the film is populated not by real people but by cardboard cutouts. At the head of the list is Maddys saintly father (Sam Robards) whose lapse into -- I kid you not -- paralysis early in the film as a result of an old mountain-climbing injury precipitates the predictable action. When Maddy learns that an experimental medical procedure is available in Europe that might allow Dad to walk again she quickly recruits her two pint-size pals one a prepubescent grease monkey (cute-as-a-button Thieriot) the other a budding computer genius (mop-topped Bleu) to abet her in the theft of a quarter-million dollars from the local bank. Unfortunately the money is suspended in a vault hanging 100 feet above ground. Fortunately Maddy happens to be an expert climber herself and her mother (Jennifer Beals) is the security consultant who designed the system. Unfortunately all of this is still flagrantly illegal no matter how good the cause. Fortunately the bank president (Michael Des Barres) is so flamboyantly evil -- he already has turned down Moms request for a legitimate loan -- that he makes Mr. Potter of ""Its a Wonderful Life"" look like Santa Claus. Other caricatures include James LeGros and Stark Sands as a pair of bumbling bank guards whose antic incompetence is worthy of the Keystone Kops. Other humor such as it is includes liberal use of such gluteo-centric epithets as ""butt-munch"" and frequent would-be hilarious mispronunciation of the word ""Ausfahrt"" a German command that the banks Rottweilers have supposedly been trained to respond to (even though the word literally means ""exit""). In addition to the crime itself the film features one example of bad behavior after another including a getaway through nighttime traffic in nitro-enhanced go-carts. Kids do not try this at home. In a sense I feel guilty being overly negative on what is in essence a live-action cartoon. On the one hand Im tempted to give this derivative ""Kid"" the whipping of a lifetime. On the other its not worth getting up out of my chair. CATCH THAT KID (PG 91 minutes) -- Contains some slapstick violence a fair amount of flatulence- and buttock-centered humor and daredevil stunts.

"Catch That Kid Let This One Get Away washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Catch That Kid Let This One Get Away Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 6 2004 Kristen Stewart brings her best game face to ""Catch That Kid"" a family action-adventure in which the young actress plays a 12-year-old tomboy named Maddy. We meet Maddy while shes climbing up a pipe on a vertiginous-looking industrial tower; shes outfitted with state-of-the-art bungee cords and carabiners. When midclimb she receives a video-phone call from her mother she cuts a convincingly agile figure as a girl-powered high-tech action hero. Soon Maddy meets up with her best friends a computer nerd named Austin (Corbin Bleu) and a gearhead named Gus (Max Thieriot) at a go-kart track run by her father whose own attempt to ascend Mount Everest has served as both inspiration and cautionary tale. While climbing he suffered a serious injury which flares up and leaves him paralyzed a condition that can be cured only by an expensive operation in Europe. Desperate for money Maddy enlists her pals to break into the bank where her mother works as a security consultant steal a quarter of a million dollars and save her fathers life. With its three very appealing young lead actors and less than idealized portrait of childhood ""Catch That Kid"" at first glance looks like it might resemble ""Holes"" one of the most refreshingly sophisticated family pictures released last year. But soon enough the promised energy humor and action give way to a lethargic and largely laugh-free procedural. ""Catch That Kid"" boasts a hip cast Jennifer Beals plays Maddys overworked mom former rocker Michael Des Barres is something of a poor mans Terence Stamp in the role of a villainous banker and James LeGros happily hams it up as a deranged security guard. But none of these turns results in sparks on-screen and even Stewart -- whose hooded wary expression perfectly captures the anxieties and frustrations of even the bravest preteen girl -- cant imbue ""Catch That Kid"" with the energy it needs to take off. For all its high-tech tomfoolery and high-speed go-kart chases the movie has the warmed-over feel of the Americanized remake that it is -- in this case of a Danish film called ""Klatretosen."" Moreover the movie isnt only boring; its troubling At one point Maddy uses her feminine wiles to manipulate the emotions of her friends both of whom have crushes on her; later on her mother covers for her crime with an elaborate lie. Thus two pretty serious ethical lapses turn out to be not only free of consequences but rewarded. Those parents forced to sit through ""Catch That Kid"" may want to use the movies running time to prepare for the discussion about right and wrong that will no doubt ensue once the lights come up. Catch That Kid (91 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for language and rude humor.

Whatever charm the original had was clearly lost in translation resulting in a tedious exercise that 6- to 10-year-olds may find mildly diverting -- a narrow target that doesnt bode well for box office. Although adapted from 2002 Danish film ""Klatretosen"" this loud tiresome kids caper fantasy (think ""Oceans Eleven"" if the title referred to the age of the characters) feels like a prolonged episode of ""Power Rangers"" minus the colorful costumes. Whatever charm the original had was clearly lost in translation resulting in a tedious exercise that 6- to 10-year-olds may find mildly diverting -- a narrow target that doesnt bode especially well for pics box office heist. Indeed watching ""Catch That Kid"" its hard to imagine an idea this banal had to be adapted from anything. Twelve-year-old Maddy (Kristen Stewart) loves climbing a passion she acquired from her dad (Sam Robards) who falls terribly ill and needs a 250000 operation that insurance wont cover. So she and her two guy friends Austin (Corbin Bleu) and Gus (Max Thieriot) decide to rob the bank whose sneering president (Michael Des Barres) rejects the familys plea for a loan. Giving them a fighting chance is the fact that Maddys mom Molly (Jennifer Beals who -- judging by the adult audiences level of interest and her own bored expression -- could use a bucket of water dropped on her) designed the banks security system. So the kids break in spending about 250000 on gadgets and evening wear in the process. Expecting logic is clearly too demanding here but in addition to the wizardry at the kids disposal its hard not to notice that beyond the high-tech alarm system the entire security detail includes two buffoonish guards and a couple of rottweilers. And just to add a Greg Louganis-like degree of difficulty to the act Maddy and her crack team pull off the elaborate stunt while baby-sitting her toddler brother. Director Bart Freundlich (""The Myth of Fingerprints"") doesnt exhibit much feel for suspense or for wrangling his youthful cast. Moreover the climactic chase -- involving the kids taking flight on souped-up go-carts -- is shot so darkly that its difficult at times to make out whats happening which is probably just as well. Like the in-release ""The Perfect Score"" which involves high school students pilfering answers to the SAT test this is theoretically larceny for a good cause; still its hard not to wonder whats next -- perhaps neglected toddlers planning a detailed escape from the drudgery of daycare? Theres also something slightly distasteful given their ages about the romantic triangle at the pics center with Maddy playing Austin and Gus against each other telling both that she loves them to secure their cooperation. Given the lifeless performances most of the emotional cues come from the music which oscillates between a heart-warming George S. Clinton score and the kind of energetic amplified tracks that would normally accompany an aerobic workout. In fact if everyone could get up and jump around to the beat maybe ""Catch That Kid"" wouldnt feel like such a waste of time.

The distinction is that Kid is aimed at much younger youth -- grade-schoolers who now have a movie telling them its OK to knock off a bank then help wreck some police cars. To quote the famed line from Jean Renoirs The Rules of the Game ""Everyone has his reasons."" The rationale here is the belated paralyzing effect of an old mountain-climbing injury on the heroines dad (Sam Robards) as he dances with mom (Jennifer Beals). It isnt a Beals flashdance or a Janet Jackson flasher-dance though either would help. Just a mild two-step and dad suddenly needs a quarter-mil for surgery. The couples 12-year-old daughter (Kristen Stewart) then recruits two smitten boys in this knot-headed remake of Denmarks Klatretosen. About the show Catch That Kid  (out of four) Stars Kristen Stewart Corbin Bleu Max Thieriot Jennifer Beals Sam Robards Director Bart Freundlich Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG for some language thematic elements and rude humor Opens nationwide Friday For conveniences sake Mom is a security officer for the bank. Whats more the script provides two more adults who are forthcoming with crucial skinny about the buildings layout and other top-secret stuff. These kids also can crack codes sophisticated enough to launch weapons of mass destruction while dangling 100 feet off the ground. Kids tone is off 100% of the time. The young actors are irredeemably bland and two of the adults (Michael Des Barres bank president James LeGros Storm Trooper-like security guard) are hammy enough to make James Brown seem controlled. The storys hook is that young Stewart has inherited Dads mountain-climbing prowess able to finesse vertical and open safe-deposit drawers as she reaches the top. As morally reprehensible as the movie is youd think these scenes would at least effect a sense of wonder. And they do as in ""I wonder when this damned thing is gonna be over.""

These kids arent superheroes. Their gadgets arent super-high-tech and they dont know any martial-arts moves. If anyone has a corporate identification here its the main villain Brisbane (Michael Des Barres) who raises a toast to ""the only success that matters -- financial."" An adult who comes to the rescue at one point is French. Yes French. (Somewhere Donald Rumsfeld is choking on his freedom fries.) Most important these kids arent spies for the good guys. Theyre bank robbers. ""Catch That Kid"" is a heist film. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""Catch That Kid"" with Kristen Stewart Corbin Bleu Max Thieriot. Directed by Bart Freundlich. Screenplay by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas. 92 minutes. Rated PG for some language thematic elements and rude humor. Several theaters. Kristen Stewart (""Panic Room"") plays Maddy a teenager in love with climbing. Her father Tom (Sam Robards) was once a world-class mountain climber but now runs a small go-cart track near L.A. An ideal movie father Tom is strong but laid-back handsome but rumpled. He talks to kids without talking down to them. One imagines him smelling of after-shave lotion despite the scruff on his face. The mother Molly (Jennifer Beals) is a free-lance security expert in the process of installing a high-tech security system at a downtown bank. Shes working long hours and rarely sees her family although she and Tom do manage a late-night impromptu slow-dance by the refrigerator light. Its cut short when Tom collapses. An old mountain-climbing injury. His doctors say hell never walk again. Of course they mention an experimental procedure which of course is only available in Denmark with a prohibitive cost (250000). When the bank heartlessly turns them down for a loan Maddy secretly decides to rob it instead. Its almost a lose-lose proposition -- ruin Moms reputation in order to heal Dads legs -- but at least it explains how she gains access to the banks security system. For help she enlists two neighborhood boys -- Austin (Corbin Bleu) a computer geek/shutterbug and Gus (Max Thieriot) a mechanic -- both of whom are smitten by her tomboyish ways. During their adventure they face the usual bumbling security guards and spout the usual ""ordinary kid lines"" in extraordinary situations. Entering the banks sleek inner sanctum for example Gus properly awed says ""We are so grounded."" Based upon the 2001 Danish film ""Klatretosen"" (""Climber Girl"") ""Catch That Kid"" can be sentimental at times and formulaic. Its star Stewart doesnt give much -- her brow is furrowed throughout -- but this makes her all the more intriguing and you understand why the boys follow her around. Despite its high concept director Bart Freundlich (""The Myth of Fingerprints"") keeps the film grounded in reality. No rocket-propelled boots (""Spy Kids"") or rocket-propelled snowboards (""Cody Banks"") for these kids just a go-cart supercharged by Microsofts Xbox. Its as close as they get to a corporate identification.

(AP Photo/FilmFour Ltd/IFC Films) Nicholas Aaron as Simon Yates in amp;quo;Touching the Voidamp;quo; ... more FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 1 Back to Gallery TOUCHING THE VOID Docudrama. Directed by Kevin Macdonald. (Not rated. 106 minutes. At the Bridge.) Survival stories tied to extreme activities always come with caveats. If the young British climber in ""Touching the Void"" had not been on a 20000- foot Peruvian mountain for example he might not nearly have died. All cynicism vanishes once ""Touching the Void"" a docudrama by Oscar- winning director Kevin Macdonald (""One Day in September"") charts climber Joe Simpsons excruciating descent. Real acting replaces re-enacting and amazing cinematography pits the limits of human will against the unruliness of nature. Interviews with Simpson and climbing partner Simon Yates narrate the action filmed at the site of the 1985 disaster and in the Alps. The thrills start on the ascent as actors Brendan Mackey (as Simpson) and Nicholas Aaron (as Yates) use the mortal tools of pickaxes and spiked boots to defy gravity on a sheer icy face. Overhead shots of tiny figures swallowed by a snowy landscape underscore the enormity of their struggles. The calamities occur on descent. Moving ahead of his partner on a rope Simpson crushes his leg on a rock. Battling severe wind chill and unstable snow and ice Yates valiantly tries to bring his partner down the mountain using a shorter length of rope. But a second accident prompts him to leave Simpson whom he presumes dead. The moral and ethical implications of Yates decision are overwhelmed by the nasty business of getting Simpson still alive after falling into a crevasse off the mountain. Macdonalds triumph here is in maintaining suspense even though we know Simpson will survive. Spiritual torture melds with physical pain in the crevasse which the real Simpson describes as having a ""dread feel -- theyre not for the living. "" Cinematographer Mike Eley seals the sense of doom with slow ascending shots of walls encased in what looks like centuries worth of ice. Profound ingenuity gets Simpson out but his trials have just started. Actor Mackey in a physically demanding role embodies the climbers struggle with grimaces and flashes of fear. We see the nearly ruined man break down only once damning the fates. The real Simpson rues the energy he wasted on his lone fit. In detailing every misstep -- Simpson hops or crawls most of the way -- Macdonald overdoes it at times. We already understand the guy is in trouble before the 30th time he stands on his broken leg. The most heartbreaking aspect of the odyssey is the real Simpsons recollection that he wasnt fighting to live but trying to get to base camp so he wouldnt die alone. The movie offers scant detail about Simpson and Yates relationship before the disaster so we dont know if they were great friends or just climbing buddies. Simpson who wrote the best-seller on which the film is based has the haunted look of a war veteran. Yates is more elusive half- grinning with unease as he tells his part of the saga. Simpson says he has forgiven his partner for leaving him but one gets the distinct feeling Yates has not forgiven himself. -- Advisory This film contains raw language disturbing images. -- Carla Meyer CATCH THAT KID Kids caper comedy. Starring Kirsten Kristen Stewart Max Thieriot Jennifer Beals and Sam Robards. Directed by Bart Freundlich. Written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas. (PG. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . ""Catch That Kid"" is a great example of how far films for kids have come in the last 10 years. Not the plot certainly which has holes you could drive one of the movies go-carts through. Or the action which is basically ""Spy Kids"" on a rope. No the difference is the hero. Shes a girl. And not one of those adorable cute-as-Hilary-Duff girls either. As Maddy Kristen Stewart is a kick-butt take-no-stuff winner who makes it all happen. Naturally she has a couple of sidekicks Gus (Max Thieriot) and Austin (Corbin Bleu). But as Maddy scales sheer walls and hangs by her fingertips 100 feet off the ground all the boys can do is stand meekly down below and call out ""Be careful Maddy"" When Gus whose only job is to push buttons that are clearly marked with numbers 2 inches high fouls up even that simple task it is clear that shes the only character who can save the day. Not that the guys believe it. ""Dont do it Maddy"" Gus calls from the safety of the floor. ""Its too dangerous"" Right. And thanks for your support. This is actually a caper film with a history. It began as a straight remake of a Danish film called ""Klatretosen"" which was a sensation in Europe. Also called ""Kletter Ida"" or ""Climbing Ida"" it was the story of three kids who attempt to pull off a bank heist to get money for an experimental operation for the heroines father. Ida or Maddy in this case is an expert climber just like her dad but shes been ordered not to break out her ropes and climbing shoes because it is too risky. But guess what? Her climbing skills turn out to be invaluable in the bank job. By all accounts there were two reasons the Danish version was so successful. First the actress playing the lead and second although it was lighthearted childrens fare it still had an edge. Well one out of two isnt bad. Stewart who was Jodie Fosters daughter in ""Panic Room"" is perfect as Maddy. She has that Avril Lavigne ""girl power"" look down. She is buffed enough to look like she really could climb sheer walls and she even walks like a jock. There are others on the screen but this is Stewarts movie. As for everything else ... Granted this is a kids movie and disbelief must be suspended but director Bart Freundlich whose ""The Myth of Fingerprints"" was a critical hit in 1997 never seems to find the tone he wants. For tweens and parents looking for an entertaining and inoffensive weekend break this is a perfectly acceptable choice. Just sit back and dont overdo the logic thing. For instance the kids must break into a money-packed bank vault that is suspended 100 feet in the air. (Geez suppose you have to make a withdrawal?) The security is impenetrable unless you have the special incredibly secret access code ... which one of the bank employees helpfully types out right in front of Maddy. Maddys mother (Jennifer Beals) is supposed to be a workaholic who doesnt have time to show Maddy how much she cares. But thats never really established. It looks more like Maddy is the one with lots of things to do while Mom is getting chewed out at her job. And finally screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas (""2 Fast 2 Furious"") have concocted two over-the-top security guards who flop and flail around in search of a laugh. Forget the edge theyre going for the banana cream pie in the face. Theres nothing terrible about ""Catch"" except that it promises a lot more than it delivers. Much for example is made of Gus astonishingly smelly socks. Surely you think that will be a part of a last-second plot twist perhaps to disable the menacing attack dogs. Nope. It turns out Gus just has smelly feet. And what started out with the feel of a tight little kids thriller turns into a Nickelodeon afternoon movie. -- Advisory Mild offensive language mostly tame PG action. -- C.W. Nevius SECRET THINGS Erotic thriller. Starring Sabrina Seyvecou Coralie Revel Roger Mirmont and Fabrice Deville. Directed by Jean-Claude Brisseau. (Not rated. 115 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.). Like most French films ""Secret Things"" begins with a scene of a beautiful woman masturbating. But ""Secret Things"" goes beyond most French films. It soon tops this with a scene of another beautiful woman masturbating and quickly trumps that with a scene set in the Paris subway in which the two heroines help each other masturbate. Ten whole minutes go by before the next masturbation scene but its a good one. Later one of the ladies seduces a man by masturbating at her desk at work. Thus once again a movie takes a subject of seemingly endless fascination and wears it out through repetition. An erotic thriller ""Secret Things"" aspires to the intrigue and moral complexity of ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"" but it plays rather like a humorless version of Barbara Stanwycks tongue-in-cheek classic ""Baby Face"" (1933). Two pretty but powerless young women decide to use their wiles to climb their way to wealth and position. As the exotic Nathalie (Coralie Revel) tells Sandrine (Sabrina Seyvecou) an innocent who catches on fast the key to driving a man crazy is in being emotionally disengaged but sexually adventurous. ""Every time you hesitate dare yourself to go a little further"" she tells her. Both women get jobs at a Parisian bank and each proceeds to try to throw a lasso over some poor schnooks head. We follow Sandrine as she goes after a powerful company manager (Roger Mirmont) who is 50 and married but just cant resist. These scenes are psychologically interesting and rather touching in that both participants seem lost. Hes in over his head blindly in love while she sits observing herself at a remove wondering why she used her allure in this way and what she expects to get from it. Writer-director Jean-Claude Brisseau numbs the audience with sex and nudity and then expects us to take it seriously when he has overwrought choruses singing during selected supposedly pivotal sexual encounters. By the time Brisseau introduces the big boss -- the young heir (Fabrice Deville) who is presented as something very near the devil himself -- ""Secret Things"" has skidded into absurdity but it never quite gets boring. Movies like this rarely are. -- Advisory This film contains full frontal nudity multiple sexual encounters and physical violence.-- Mick LaSalle Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 4 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 5 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 6 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Clinton speech draws mixed reaction on cable news 10 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F.

"Slick Kid doesnt steal the show - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Slick Kid doesnt steal the show By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  February 6 2004 Can movies make people do stupid things? Maybe. Depends on the movie; depends on the person. I grant you I might not have been the sharpest pin in the cushion in the early 60s when I watched Beaver Cleaver back his fathers car out of the driveway into traffic then turned off the TV went outside and did the exact same thing but most of my friends were smart enough to know better.Which is a roundabout way of saying that the target audience for ""Catch That Kid"" -- children between the ages of 6 and 13 -- will in all likelihood not walk out of the movie with the urge to knock over a bank. A shot-for-shot remake of the 2002 Danish film ""Catch That Girl"" ""Kid"" is a slick little package that will seem patently ridiculous to anyone past adolescence even as their younger brothers and sisters eat it up. Its a heist movie for kids though and if that prompts tut-tutting in certain quarters know that the postscreening conversation with my own children went something like this""Did you like it?""""Yeah Four stars"" (Sadly this is what happens when your father is a film critic.)""Did it make you want to rob a bank?""""Of course not Its a movie.""And there you go -- if we grown-ups can have ""The Italian Job"" who says our spawn cant have their own cheesy empowerment-fantasy robbery flicks?""Kid"" at least gives its 12-year-old heroine a motivation a gravely ill father who cant afford a life-saving experimental treatment. Maddy (Kristen Stewart last seen as Jodie Fosters beleaguered daughter in ""Panic Room"") is a lithe California tomboy with Avril Lavignes borrowed scowl and a knack for scaling the local water tower. Her mother -- yes Jennifer Beals from ""Flashdance"" is playing mothers now; are you depressed? -- is a workaholic who is installing a high-tech security system in a downtown LA bank; her father (Sam Robards) is an ex-mountaineer who runs a go-cart track until he is struck down by NMLD (Nameless Movie Languishing Disease).Realizing her fathers salvation lies in a bank vault suspended 100 feet above a motion-sensor-equipped shaft Maddy looks to her two best friends for help computer whiz Austin (Corbin Bleu) and mechanically inclined Gus (Max Thieriot). Since both boys nurse puppy-love crushes on her she is forced to fool each into thinking she loves him and him only.Stewart looks properly disgusted at having to stoop to such Veronica Lodge-isms. And to tell you the truth her manipulations are more bothersome than the heist itself as is the scene in which Gus talks a secretary into giving him a scale model of the bank by pretending to be a battered child -- this is dishonest behavior that can be imitated at home or school. (Cut to reaction shot of the reviewers children shaking their heads in disagreement.)Otherwise all the genre cliches are welded into place. Overriding the security cameras check. Entering the right code before the vaults timer counts down to zero check. Hair-raising chase scene between tiny vehicles (here its go-carts) and soon-to-be-disabled police cars check. For good measure ""Kid"" throws in a cartoonishly fascistic security chief (indie actor James Le Gros slumming it) a cartoonishly nasty bank manager (Michael Des Barres) and random fart jokes. The one unexpected twist -- and the films best running gag -- is that Maddy has to tote her toddler brother (played by twins Grant and Shane Scott) along on the heist after mom orders her to baby-sit. I dont recall Tom Cruise having that problem in ""Mission Impossible.""Still its no ""Spy Kids"" although director Bart Freundlich (Mr. Julianne Moore to you) gives it the old college try and Stewart glowers appealingly throughout. ""Catch That Kid"" flatters its audience by dividing the grown-up world into mean idiots and nice idiots which might be interestingly subversive if the movie had anything on its mind. Instead its just a Hollywood crash course Heist Films 101.But Id still check my wallet before I went to bed if I were you.(""Catch That Kid"" )Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

This quasi-absurdist understatement reads like a damning bit of comic irony - but Catch That Kid is dead serious. (""I know I havent been there for you"" is the next thing out of Beals mouth.) Yeah Im guessing Maddy knew it was wrong around the time she had her young admirers (Corbin Bleu and Max Thieriot) disable the banks alarm system and arrange their go-cart escape. Im guessing she knew it was wrong when she used her ripening tween wiles not only to secure the loyalty of her boy accomplices but to distract a security guard who looks at least 19. (Girl power) ""Kid"" seeks to ""empower"" its target audience of recent Pokemon grads with an adult antihero desperation that feels preemptive and inappropriate. (Maddys father needs an expensive operation - thus larceny.) Its all fantasy sure but whose? That of the young audience its aimed at or of the grown-up children who made it?
