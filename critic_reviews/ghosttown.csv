Zhao Dayongs magisterial docu ""Ghost Town"" minutely examines the day-to-day doings in the dying town of Zhiziluo in the mountains of Chinas Yunan province. At a leisurely 172 minutes the pic takes on the desultory rhythms of rural stagnation its rigorous compositions imparting aesthetic weight and meditative scope to everything in its purview. The camera might as easily linger on a bunch of dogs warily sniffing each other as on emotionally charged human interactions. Niche items appeal should not be particularly affected by its length which may even enhance its arthouse cachet. Zhao divides his docu into three parts proceeding from the towns oldest inhabitants to its youngest. The first ""Voices"" centers on estranged father-and-son pastors whose different historical experiences manifest themselves in theological disputes over music. The father imprisoned for 25 years because of his beliefs passionately clings to the cultural biases of his European missionary teachers while his son blends Christian spiritual values with Chinese customs. Yet despite the bitter generational divides caused by Chinas extreme policy shifts the small rituals of making tea or leafing through a Bible give rise to a serenity that infuses all corners of Zhiziluo. That serenity absorbs the shock of the multiple domestic dramas in the docus second section ""Recollections."" An abandoned husband neglecting his pigs turns instead to drink -- the reason his wife left him in the first place. A young woman with a baby back to visit her family decries the swindlers who tricked her into a loveless marriage far away. A struggling truck driver unable to find parts for his ramshackle vehicle is forced to depart for the city and abandon his girlfriend whose destitute parents are considering selling her as a bride to a couple of outsiders. None of these twentysomethings can remain in Zhiziluo. In the third part ""Innocence"" a 12-year-old boy left behind when his parents were uprooted years ago survives by trapping and eating small birds his energy and tumbling interaction with other village kids engaging the camera in constant movement in contrast with the stasis of the rest of the film. Zhao thematically comes full circle to pagan and religious iconography as the boy participates in a fiery ghost exorcism then slips into church to sing Christian hymns. The ironic final images fix upon a large white statue of Mao Zedong his arm raised in benediction but with his back to the town. Ghost TownChina ProductionA Lantern Films China production.

Its an odd remark especially when Gervais is the last person who should be blamed for the films failings. Assuming his usual guise as the jittery acid-tongued malcontent he excels as a dentist with the Groucho-esque moniker of Bertram Pincus. He dies for seven minutes during a colonoscopy and on leaving hospital is able to see members of NYCs dead who have business to attend to in the land of the living. The spirit of a city slicker played by Greg Kinnear railroads him into stopping his graceful other half (Tea Leoni) marrying a smug lawyer but when Pincus gets to know her well you can guess the rest... Its not unlikeable - but no effort has been made to make anything more of the Scrooge-comes-good model. Gervaiss sweetly pathetic performance masks many of the failings of the by-the-book quirky direction and workaday script but Leoni is decent as the romantic foil and Kinnears slimy-everyman act works well. Enjoyable as it is to see Gervais trying (and often succeeding) to make something of the mediocre dialogue its not enough.

It is NOT hilarious (in an Airplane sort of way) but it IS witty (like Notting Hill). There are no laugh-out moments especially if this film is watched in Northampton where the clientele appear to be mostly into toilet or juvenile humour (great lovers of Mama Mia for instance) Ghost Town is a conventional `romcom` with a very predictable plot line. For all that if one is prepared to check in oneaEUR(tm)s brain at the door its an enjoyable film in an easy-going non-hassaldrous sort of way. The current rating of 3 stars seems about fair even though I am giving it a four-star rating because I really liked the Gervais character (when it was at its most abrasive).FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 31 2008gemma08Featuredvery funny film. definitely worth seeing.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 31 2008critiqueFeaturedEnjoyable comedy carried to a great extent by Gervais.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 31 2008Guess WhoFeaturedGreart comedy worth watching FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 31 2008Guess WhoFeaturedGreart comedy worth watching FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 31 2008Damian HiscocksFeaturedI saw this film yesterday with my family.

"Review Gervais gives edge to Ghost Town - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Gervais gives edge to Ghost TownStory Highlights Ricky Gervais in ""Ghost Town"" is a winner Gervais plays misanthropic dentist who suddenly sees dead people Movie works thanks to Gervais truculence good supporting cast Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Is Ricky Gervais movie star material? Ricky Gervais deals with the dead in ""Ghost Town."" The former stand-up became a celebrity at 40 when he created the character of David Brent in the British sitcom ""The Office."" Gervais pulled the plug on that international hit after only two seasons and then scored another (less widespread) success with his follow-up ""Extras"" as a frustrated actor rubbing shoulders with the stars while hes relegated to walk-ons. Meanwhile Gervais weighed offers from Hollywood taking small supporting roles alongside Ben Stiller (""Night at the Museum"") Christopher Guest (""For Your Consideration"") and Robert De Niro (""Stardust"") while waiting for the right vehicle to come along. ""Ghost Town"" gives him a nice introduction as a lead. Written by John Kamps (""Zathura"") and David Koepp (""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"") and directed by Koepp ""Ghost Town"" is a light comedy about a misanthropic dentist Bertram Pincus who develops an unwelcome sixth sense after losing his vital signs for several minutes during a routine colonoscopy. He sees dead people. New York is full of ghosts -- and believing that Pincus might settle their unfinished business they flock to his side. But Bertram isnt a people person not when theyre alive and not when theyre dead. If he agrees to help Frank (Greg Kinnear) its only because he promises to hold the rest back -- and because Frank has an attractive widow Gwen (Tea Leoni). If saving her from an untrustworthy fiance means Bertram has to offer himself as an alternative then so be it. By now youre probably ticking off how many times youve seen this story before in ""Ghost"" and ""Always"" and just a few months ago ""Over Her Dead Body."" ""Ghost Town"" doesnt reinvent the wheel but it does goose the formula romantic comedy cliches. Theres no meet-cute for example Pincus closes the elevator on her and then steals her cab. The fiance turns out to be as perfect as he seems (if insufferably earnest); there isnt even a kiss. Koepps idea of romance involves mummified corpses dental forensics and Bertrams sensitive gag reflex. Not simply a David Brent clone Pincus is a cold fish a crab who doesnt want to be drawn out of his shell. Its not crowds he doesnt like he explains to Gwen its the individuals in the crowd. Once upon a time he might have been played by W.C. Fields (who was famous for his dentist sketch) or more recently Bill Murray. Gervais is in that ornery tradition of awkward customers and he comes with the considerable built-in advantage of being English which makes his disdain and sarcasm all the more heartfelt. Theres a terrific early scene when he goes in to hospital for his operation and brusquely dismisses the standard patient questionnaire as intrusive and irrelevant. On the one hand this guy clearly has something ugly stuck up his posterior (he is in for colonoscopy after all); on the other you want to stand up and cheer him on. Naturally Koepp makes it his business to redeem this unpleasant character and recast him as an acceptable stand-in for a romantic lead. But cynics should not despair; its not a complete makeover. If Bertram charms Gwen its because she cant stop cracking up at his cantankerous bad humor his smocks and his spiky honesty. With her infectiously throaty laugh Leoni would be any comedians ideal romantic foil and she brings a lot to this party. Ultimately love prevails sentiment trumps sarcasm and the jokes peter out accordingly (though the movie does muster one last bold black comic sideswipe before its through). Fans may feel that Gervais is straying too far from the discomfort zone where he really strikes a chord. Certainly theres nothing radical about ""Ghost Town.""

So yes this smallish fantasy is a comic riff on ""The Sixth Sense"" which has gone from thriller to cliche in nine years. And yes the new film which David Koepp directed from a script he wrote with John Kamps is inevitably deadened by contrivance. But its enlivened by the performance of Ricky Gervais as Bertram Pincus a latter-day Scrooge for whom the living are no less annoying than the dead. ENLARGE From left Ricky Gervais Tea Leoni and Greg Kinnear in ""Ghost Town"" Everett Collection Mr. Gervais is the British comedian who played the smug office manager in the original BBC version of ""The Office."" At first his performance here is a model of unyielding almost plaintive misanthropy in the face of Mr. Koepps otherwise broad comic style. A Manhattan dentist who uses the appliances of his trade to silence garrulous patients Pincus genuinely dislikes people and Mr. Gervais only intensifies his characters acidity when the dentist finds himself bedeviled by a group of needy nudgy ghosts. (Since the trailer will tell you exactly how and why this happens I wont.) Chief among the spectral nuisances is Greg Kinnears Frank Herlihy a dead man walking the sidewalks of New York in the dinner jacket he was wearing when he died. He wants Pincus to break up the impending re-marriage of his widow Gwen an archaeologist played by Tea Leoni. As the fable wears on Franks beseechments get to be repetitive and Pincuss flintiness runs low on verve. For all the brilliance of his success in TV Mr. Gervais doesnt have extensive experience as an actor in feature films and Mr. Koepp isnt the director to help him. Courtesy of Paramount Pictures. His performance grows more appealing -- the genuine animus gives way to some sweetness -- once the relationship between Pincus and Gwen moves beyond some elaborately unfunny antics involving a mummy and the script starts to give its Scrooge a new appreciation of life. (Id almost forgotten what a fine comedienne Ms. Leoni can be until a scene with her entering an elevator.) Eventually though ""Ghost Town"" buckles beneath the weight of contrivance -- so many ghosts to dispel so many lessons to learn. And the films physical aspects raise questions about population density. For a while we seem to be watching a for-ghosts-only version of Manhattan where the sidewalks are uncrowded and traffic moves freely in the streets. But no this is not the case. The living live there too though in such small numbers as to enjoy plenty of lebensraum. Thats the ultimate fantasy. The Duchess During one moment of excitement in ""The Duchess"" an 18th-century costume drama starring Keira Knightley as the Duchess of Devonshire Georgiana Spencer the unhappy heroine gets tipsy at a big party and has a frightening encounter with a candelabras flames. ""Please put out her graces hair"" her dour husband commands and the deed is done in the nick of time. The production is lavish the star is lovely and her character occupies a special place in English history as a great beauty a great wit a great model of proto-feminism and the great-great-great-great-aunt of Princess Diana. Whats missing is dramatic fire. Also in Weekend JournalActress Keira Knightley on big wigs the Di debate and the new movie The Duchess. Adviser Knightleys Noble Again You might not know that if you watched with the sound turned off. All the pieces of a powerful drama look to be in place -- a passionate young woman who for all her celebrity and star power might just as well be the late princess; Georgianas implacably dispassionate husband William the 5th Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes); Georgianas best friend Bess (Hayley Atwell) who turns their marriage into a menage a trois; and a backdrop of reform politics in a time of tumultuous change. With the sound turned on the campaign oratory could pass for proto-McCain/Obama but thats a minor distraction or amusement. The major deficits lie in the script which was adapted from the scintillating biography by Amanda Foreman and in what the director Saul Dibb has made of it. Instead of scintillation the movie gives us a succession of discrete set pieces as if the action takes place in rooms but not in the halls connecting them; dialogue that plays on the surface of Georgianas brilliance without getting under her skin let alone into her soul and a resolutely glum portrayal by Mr. Fiennes that may be true to Williams character but leaves us yearning for less. Princess Di deserves livelier revisionism. Appaloosa As for the woman in ""Appaloosa"" a Western directed and co-written by Ed Harris no one can accuse her of being a proto-feminist. Allison French a young widow played by Renee Zellweger wants nothing more or less than to get her hooks into the top hand in town whoever he may be. (Were also told that shes attracted to the boss stallion but he is not by way of keeping things clear a horse.) Mr. Harris plays Appaloosas city marshal Virgil Cole a rigid moralist who falls for Allie as he has never fallen before. Viggo Mortensen -- the two men appeared together in ""A History of Violence"" -- is Virgils deputy and steadfast friend Everett Hitch and Jeremy Irons is the bad-guy rancher Randall Bragg who runs the town until the two lawmen challenge his ruthless reign. Given Allies obviously unpleasant proclivities its hard to understand why Virgil loves her so ardently. But its equally hard to understand why Allie doesnt see that Virgils moral code masks a violent psychopathic streak or why that streak comes and goes without anyone ever discussing it. Or why for that matter ""Appaloosa"" is so mannered episodic and slow though it can be a danger sign when a movie is directed by one of its stars and carries credits for eight producers. Lakeview Terrace ""Lakeview Terrace"" occupies the bottom of the weeks barrel. This joyless and airless suspense thriller stars Samuel L. Jackson as Abel Turner a veteran LAPD cop whose smoldering racism explodes into assaultive fascism when a young interracial couple moves into the house next door. (Theyre played by Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington.) The model for this genre is Sam Peckinpahs surpassingly bleak and superviolent ""Straw Dogs"" but Abel has been written as a straw man and Mr. Jackson an actor of formidable gifts plays him with the subtlety of a robot stuck in destruct mode. The question posed by the vulgar script is whether the earnestly liberal couple -- he drives a Prius -- will withstand the tensions that Abels bigotry foments and stand up to their neighbors tyranny. The answer is yes on both counts and they cope with raging brushfires in the bargain. The movies only mark of restraint is the absence of an earthquake. DVD TIP Ive recommended ""Truly Madly Deeply"" before. Nows a perfect time to recommend it again. The late Anthony Minghellas first feature made in 1991 is a witty gorgeously lyrical and infinitely superior alternative to ""Ghost"" which came out the previous year. Juliet Stevenson is Nina drowning in grief since the death of her musician lover. Alan Rickman is the musician Jamie who unfazed by his death hangs out at Ninas house and invites dead friends to keep him company.

ABOUT THE MOVIEGhost Town (out of four)Stars Ricky Gervais Greg Kinnear Ta Leoni Billy CampbellDirector David KoeppDistributor Paramount Rating PG-13 for some strong language sexual humor and drug referencesRunning time 1 hour 42 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Theres nothing otherworldly about the super natural performances in Ghost Town led by the distinctively edgy and witty British comedian Ricky Gervais. Audiences who already know and appreciate Gervais talents from the British version of The Office or HBOs Extras will get a special treat here as he proves himself an offbeat but undeniably charming leading man. Those who dont know him will no doubt want to get acquainted. CLIP See a preview of Ghost Town INTERVIEW Ricky Gervais believes in Ghost Ghost Town written and directed by David Koepp (who wrote Jurassic Park) is a good-natured and engaging fantasy/romantic comedy in the tradition of Heaven Can Wait or even Topper. Gervais stars as Bertram Pincus a curmudgeonly and solitary dentist who has a near-death experience during a routine medical procedure. As a result he has the ability to see dead people. But they also see him and naggingly prevail upon him to help take care of their unfinished business. Chief among the determined dead is Frank (Greg Kinnear) who wants Pincus to interfere with the impending marriage of his widow Gwen (Tea Leoni) to a lawyer (Billy Campbell). Pincus initially refuses to get involved not so much because he doesnt want to meddle but because hes not the helping type. But then Frank promises to never bother him again and to get all the other recently deceased off his back if hell grant him this one favor. Of course things get more complicated -- and funnier -- when the lonely dentist tries to get to know Gwen better. The film moves along briskly offering plenty of laughs even though the plot particulars are at times predictable. The ensemble cast is strong particularly Leoni who is wonderfully natural. But this is Gervais movie. His inherent on-screen likability helps us sympathize with if not cheer on his slimeball character. And he manages to be a wide spectrum of personality traits low-key and awkward one moment then snide snobbish or misanthropic the next. But we still root for him. As we watch him shed his steely shell of self-protection and reach out to others it feels life-affirming never sappy. Ghost Town is what used to be called a sleeper. Sure its a light comedy but it effectively achieves what it sets out to do amuse us and tug on our heartstrings. And best of all its written directed and acted with intelligence and wit.

Sept. 19 2008 Starring Ricky Gervais Greg Kinnear and Tea Leone. Directed by David Koepp. 102 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Bertram Pincus DDS is a bitter and judgemental man who truly loathes his life. But consider the alternative - which Pincus is about to be forced to confront. Hes about to find out that as dissatisfying and disappointing as he may find living it is infinitely more aggravating dealing with death.Article Continued BelowNot his - at least not for more than a few minutes.When an accident during a routine colonoscopy renders him briefly lifeless on the operating table he awakens with the unwanted ""gift"" of being able to perceive and communicate with the newly dead.At least with those souls held back from peaceful rest by unfinished business left over from life.Which even more unfortunately includes Frank Herlihy a fast-talking ex-executive with guilt issues over his serial philandering and a death wish (as in a wish after death) for his former wife to dump her too-good-to-be-true fiance and find happiness with someone else.I think you see where this is going. But Ghost Town is a romantic comedy about extremely unlikeable people. You really wouldnt care about any of them were it not for the films stellar casting ... well if not quite stellar then absolutely engaging.Starting with Ricky Gervais as Pincus his film lead debut. The British creator/writer/star of The Office and Extras is certainly no stranger to the art of the a-hole. His Office boss David Brent was superficially the most loathsome/pathetic character to ever make us laugh till it hurt. Likewise in his nastier moments as Extras Andy Millman.But through it all there always shone this subtle gleeful naughty schoolboy charm not quite a full-on wink at the audience but a tacit acknowledgement that sometimes even total jerks can exhibit an endearing charm.It is interesting that director/co-writer David Koepp - primarily a screenwriter of blockbusters like Jurassic Park Spider-Man War of the Worlds and the latest Indiana Jones - has recently expressed second thoughts about casting Gervais in the lead on the basis that he is still a virtual unknown in America. Well who the hell was Seth Rogan before Knocked Up? Or for that matter Johnny Depp before Edward Scissorhands? John Travolta before Saturday Night Fever? Al Pacino pre-Godfather? Would Ghost Town have been any more enjoyable with say Ben Stiller in the lead? Quite the opposite I suspect.Gervais character is at least ultimately redeemable as is to a lesser extent Kinnears motormouth Herlihy - particularly his constant sad attempts to get a post-mortem signal on his omnipresent BlackBerry (or rather I guess the ghost of his BlackBerry - it makes no sense but its a cute running joke).Tea Leonis misguided widow is something else entirely in her case unintentionally unlikeable - the victim of poor writing and a needlessly needy poorly conceived and inconsistent character.It is only Leonis irresistable charm that makes the girl even remotely sympathetic - just as conversely her mere proximity as Adam Sandlers neurotic wife made Spanglish somehow bearable.I swear she just gets better and more interesting and more luminously beautiful with the passing years.You are moved to ask the same question you ask in real life - what on earth was her husband (David Duchovny he of the sex-addiction rehab) thinking?

British actor Ricky Gervais (L) portrays dentist Bertram Pincus who is pursued by ghosts in the comedy ?Ghost Town."" . Photo Sarah Shatz DreamWorks Movie review Ghost Town 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Ghost Town Comedy. Co-written and directed by David Koepp. With Ricky Gervais Greg Kinnear and Tea Leoni. (PG-13. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete listings and movie times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) ""Ghost Town"" a romantic comedy about the living and the dead coming to terms with each other is both very funny and a bit of a tearjerker with an on-the-money performance from Ricky Gervais and a nice feeling for New York in fall. This is the first lead in an American picture for the talented Gervais who was wickedly good in the BBC version of ""The Office"" and it should establish him as a major player. Its also a surprisingly capable first comedy from co-writer and director David Koepp who made his name scripting movies of an altogether different sort (""Jurassic Park"" ""Mission Impossible"" ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""). Landing Gervais for the main role a misanthropic Manhattan dentist who sees ghosts and adding top-notch support from Tea Leoni and Greg Kinnear gave Koepp a head start that he capitalizes on nicely. Big Apple businessman Frank (Kinnear) who is having an extramarital affair accidentally joins the spirit world and like many of the citys other ghosts (New York is ""lousy"" with them he observes) hes left behind unfinished business. He cannot give up controlling his anthropologist widow (Leoni) and needs assistance from those among the living to break up her pending marriage. Help turns out to be dentist Bertram Pincus (Gervais) a dour fussbudget perpetually put out because hes surrounded by dunderheads - namely the rest of humanity. Hes mean to his neighbors and sour with his patients. That he is an all-around jerk is made clear when he snubs a small in-office party held by his friendly partner Dr. Prashar (Aasif Mandvi) to celebrate a new baby. One day Bertram starts encountering dead people who are astonished and excited that he can see them. Horrified he returns to the hospital where he has recently had a colonoscopy and in a great exchange with his evasive doctor (Kristen Wiig) he learns that he was technically dead for a few minutes. Begging for human aid to resolve various problems theyve left behind the ghosts pester Bertram in ever-growing numbers chasing him down the leafy Manhattan streets and invading his office and apartment. Frank is willing to use his obvious way with words to get the ghosts off Bertrams back if the dentist agrees to intervene with the widows wedding plans. Quickly Bertram falls for her and complications follow. Gervais performance - all acid tongue and priggishness - is what makes this comedy work The story plays out like a curdled version of ""Topper."" Leoni with her fine comic gifts works delightfully off Gervais and the caddish Frank is a good role for the reliable Kinnear. The script by Koepp and John Kamps goes a bit soggy at the end but not enough to bury the proceedings. (One notable lapse is a brief gag involving Asian names.) The conclusion underlines how much the dead are dependent on the living a touching point even if the filmmakers feel compelled to spell it out. The autumnal photography by Fred Murphy is handsome and the numerous scenes along Fifth Avenue evoke a Woody Allen state of mind. -- Advisory Some strong language sexual humor and drug references.

Imagine David Brent of ""The Office"" with some brains and a touch of Jack Nicholsons character in ""As Good as It Gets"" and youve got Dr. Bertram Pincus a misanthropic dentist who scuttles past the office party on the way out the door so he can get home to his prearranged pajamas and his crossword puzzle with its three neatly laid-out pencils. Like Brent he insults people; unlike Brent he does it on purpose. He likes being a dentist because he can shove things into peoples mouths when they talk too much ""Youre resting your jaw. Im resting my ears. Were all winners."" In the hospital for a routine procedure he encounters what his doctor (Kristen Wiig of ""SNL"" who is again hilarious in a near cameo and has easily earned the right to play lead roles) calls ""a cessation."" Or maybe it was ""a biochemical anomaly."" Or perhaps ""You died. A little bit."" Now he can see the ghosts of dead people with unfinished business - such as Frank (Greg Kinnear) a sleazy fellow tenant of Bertrams Upper East Side building who was cheating on his wife (Tea Leoni) when he died. Frank is haunting/harrying/mocking Dr. Pincus for as long as it takes for Bertram to break up the widows relationship with a do-gooder lawyer. Lots of funny although familiar scenes follow in which Bertram simultaneously fends off the nagging ghosts that follow him everywhere while trying to carry on conversations with living people who cant hear the dead. The situation has been a comedy staple for decades but Gervais has both the delivery and the pointed script (co- written by ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Spider-Man"" screenwriter David Koepp who also directs) to deliver major laughs. Even throwaway moments that seem improvised are great such as when Bertram refuses to answer personal questions asked by a nurse or tells a doorman to stop saying ""Bless you"" every time he sneezes. Gervais does some classic hate-shtick that harks back to the great insult comics but with a Brit twist. When he mutters ""stenchy ethnic food that stings the eyes"" hes talking about tacos. The interaction between Bertram and Frank leads to brilliant odd-couple friction as when they go to a fancy bar and Frank keeps toolishly twiddling away at his BlackBerry even though it no longer works when youve roamed into the great beyond. When Frank starts to outline some situations in which his widow could be tempted away from her current fiance - ""You show up as the cable guy or the innocent pizza guy"" - Bertram says ""You watch a lot of porn dont you?"" Breaking Bertram out of his shell proves to be a challenge for Frank. When the dentist approaches the widow the best line he can think of is ""Shoes. Your shoes. Are. Comfortable."" A plot development that isnt really explained Frank promises he has the ability to keep the other ghosts from bugging Bertram for favors but why does Frank have influence over the others? In the third act the movie all but announces its going to copy ""Groundhog Day"" then does so. Some fans of Gervais are going to feel cheated by the blatant sentimentality but a lot of great comedies are bait-and-switch affairs. What ""Ghost Town"" has on its mind is so immense most dramas never approach it in heft the yearning to have all of your affairs in order when you die. Although ghost hijinks are a very Hollywood way of dealing with the subject the twists are executed superbly right up to a climax that fits the David Mamet definition of what makes for a perfect ending It is both surprising and inevitable. GHOST TOWN Sixth sense for comedy. Running time 103 minutes. Rated PG- 13 (profanity sexual humor drug references). At the Kips Bay the E-Walk the 84th Street others.

After all there have been a zillion comedies haunted by meddlesome spirits and despite a few notable exceptions most have entered theaters DOA. (""Over Her Dead Body"" anyone?) So what could this late entry offer that we havent seen before?Ricky Gervais thats what.PHOTOS BEHIND THE SCENES OF ""GHOST TOWN""Leave it to the unfailingly brilliant Gervais to breathe new life into an expiring genre. Television books even podcasts Hes made magic of them all and now in his first leading film role he does it again.RELATED READ MORE ABOUT THE FILMING OF ""GHOST TOWN""Gervais is Bertram Pincus an ultra-grumpy Manhattan dentist who views social engagements as suspiciously as the rest of us eye a dental drill. He lives alone he has no friends and hes happy to keep things that way.But when a flaky doctor (an amusing Kristen Wiig) botches his colonoscopy his entire existence is upended. Having flatlined for several minutes during the procedure Bertram now has access to the Great Beyond or at least to the ghosts who reside there. And since hes one of the few able to see and communicate with the dead hes hounded by them constantly.The way the afterlife works according to director (and co-writer) David Koepp is that everyone sticks around in ghostly form until they resolve any unfinished business. For recently departed Frank (Greg Kinnear) that means keeping his widow Gwen (Tea Leoni) unattached. Frank nags Bertram until the reluctant dentist agrees to break up Gwens new relationship but in the process of course Bertram falls for her himself.Leoni and Kinnear are charming and Koepp keeps the mood appropriately light. But really this would be just another disposable comedy if it werent for our unassuming star. Gervais isnt an actor of unlimited range but hes so effortlessly funny his expressions elicit laughs before he even opens his mouth. More important still he proves that - big screen or small - hes eternally able to locate the lost souls who hide beneath their bluster.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Ghost Town (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Ghost Town (PG-13)  Boorish smarmy stars give comedy real bite. Ricky Gervais in a scene from ""Ghost Town."" Photo Sarah Shatz. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald No one is quite so gifted a portrayer of the modern boor as Ricky Gervais and in Ghost Town he plays Bertram Pincus DDS with his usual delectable sneering grace. To say that Bertram is standoffish is to miss the point. Bertram hates most people. He wants nothing to do with them but a dentist actually must touch his patients. Fortunately he is also allowed to stuff cotton in their mouths which keeps their attempts at chatting to a minimum. If only we all could avail ourselves of such a luxury. But when Bertram starts seeing dead people -- turns out he died briefly during a routine operation and can perceive what the rest of us cant -- and they start chasing him all over Manhattan begging him to talk to the loved ones they left behind hes forced to listen. Dead tuxedoed playboy Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear in full smarm) promises to keep the others away if Bertram will do him a favor Prevent his widow Gwen (Tea Leoni) from marrying the lawyer (Billy Campbell) Frank thinks is a jerk. Having two aggressively unlikeable leads gives Ghost Town a welcome edge. This comedic twist on The Sixth Sense (or maybe on director David Koepps creepy A Stir of Echoes) is basically a typical romantic comedy about a loser inspired to change his misanthropic ways to win the love of a good woman. Bertrams ludicrous plan is to make Gwen like him instead of big handsome Billy Campbell. In a development virtually required by romantic comedy Bertram falls for her instead. What ensues is predictable but amusing. The painfully awkward stubby Gervais as romantic lead is a funny enough concept but the actors ongoing banter with Kinnear is engaging and their styles mesh entertainingly. The film also benefits greatly from a couple of appearances by the hilarious Kristen Wiig of Saturday Night Live as an evasive and far-too-tanned surgeon. The Daily Shows Aasif Mandvi shows up as Pincus nice-guy partner and the reliable Leoni does a nice job playing straight woman to the boys shenanigans. But really the film belongs to Gervais the genius behind the original The Office and HBOs excruciating Extras which is so agonizingly funny its almost impossible to watch. Hes so fine at playing the guy you can barely stand that he deserves this shot at being the hero who wants to get the girl and is willing to die trying. Cast Ricky Gervais Greg Kinnear Tea Leoni Billy Campbell Director David Koepp Screenwriters David Koepp John Kamps Producer Gavin Polone A Paramount release. Running time 102 minutes.

In Ghost Town ghost Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear right) recruits dentist Bertram Pincus (Ricky Gervais) to sabotage the marriage of Herlihys widowed wife. Photo SARAH SHATZ Sarah Shatz Ghost Town 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Ghost Town opens with a brief shot of a New York City street emptied of its usual human hustle the Big Apple as a ghost town in the traditional sense. But the image fades. And the title we learn refers to overpopulation. ""New York is lousy with ghosts"" whines a recent spectral arrival a gadabout adulterer named Frank. Portrayed by Greg Kinnear in a crisp black tux unspoiled by the bus that whacked him sideways Frank has unfinished business with his widowed wife Gwen (Tea Leoni) who is now engaged to ""a real scumbag lawyer -- a bad bad guy."" And he cant do a danged thing about it without Bertram Pincus D.D.S. whom he recruits from across the ether to sabotage Gwens upcoming marriage. Three things you must know about Bertrum Pincus. One He is a misanthropic dentist arguably the most misanthropic dentist to grace the screen since Little Shop of Horrors. Two He sees dead people lots and lots of dead people and he appears to be the only living soul on the isle of Manhattan who can. Three Hes played by Ricky Gervais which means both his misanthropy and his dentistry are somehow maddeningly funny. Perhaps its that stammering inability of his to complete most any thought in normal linear fashion. Before our eyes sentences disintegrate into a sandy clutter of fragments hemming and hand jives. Or perhaps its his face that exquisite pasty canvas of vanity and fear -- a face that can accommodate blanched terror and ridiculous self-absorption simultaneously with room to spare for loneliness pigheadedness and the less quantifiable strangeness of an alien interloper who hasnt yet decoded earthling communications. Gervais obviously hails from another planet or short of that the original BBC version of The Office. But theres also a gentleness to the man -- like E.T. he comes in peace -- that warms up in the middle of Ghost Town when he dials down the testy iconoclasm and joins the human race. This being a romantic comedy sparks will fly between Bertram and Gwen. This being a supernatural comedy pushy ghosts will drop in on Bertram at inopportune times in anachronistic (or merely absent) clothing asking for help in pursuit of worldly closure. Much of this is familiar enough from Ghost or The Sixth Sense or to rewind several decades Topper -- in which Constance Bennett and a tuxedoed Cary Grant were glam dead marrieds who couldnt R.I.P. until they cheered up a fuddy-duddy friend. As Frank Kinnear has swiped both the bowtie and the scrunched brow from Grant who its worth noting was fictionalized as a suave ectoplasmic advice-giver in 2004s That Touch of Pink. (Kyle McLachlan played him natch cum tux.) But if the plot of Ghost Town sounds like a retread its whimsy and sweetness work like a charm. There is so much to like in this kooky kind-hearted and often hilarious film Leonis spunk; Gervais shock; a mummy-inspection bit featuring organs in canopic jars; an absurd monologue on self-righteous teeth."" A scene between Bertram and a surgeon who performs his colonoscopy (Saturday Night Lives Kristen Wiig) is a tour de force of dissembling cross-talk and half-mumbled interruptions -- to say more would ruin the fun. Here and elsewhere the timing is delicious. With lesser talent in front of the camera or a heavier hand behind it the film might have crashed with a thud. But in his first directorial effort since 2004s half-baked Secret Window David Koepp (who wrote Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) joins his bent for supernatural storytelling with a nimble comic touch. He and co-scribe John Kamps turned out a high-spirited screenplay but then he did a wise thing -- he backed off. He gave Gervais room to be Gervais letting scenes play out with lovely absurdist rhythms. Sometimes a smart director turns into a ghost himself. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals GameStop Summer Sale Banana Republic Final Cut Sale Up to 75% off + free shipping...

Nor it turns out is he a dead-people person. During a routine medical procedure in ""Ghost Town"" David Koepps comedy about grief and letting go Bertram dies. Minutes later hes revived. The mini-disaster leaves the dour dentist with an unwanted gift and David Koepps charming movie starring Ricky Gervais Greg Kinnear and Tea Leoni with one of its most hilarious exchanges. Kristen Wiig is deadpan exquisite in her brief appearances as a self-involved surgeon who tries to tell Bertram something happened during his hospital stay without admitting exactly what. The scenes with her Bertram and a hospital functionary are the first -- but hardly the last -- to reveal Koepps trust in the rhythms of this wonderfully old-fashioned character-celebrating comedy. Penned by Koepp and John Kamps the script juggles the story of two men -- one dead one emotionally flatlined -- in need of enlightening and the woman they bond over. Unlike Bertrams brush with the end Frank Herlihys run- in comes with finality. Kinnears cad of a character is making love-nest plans when he meets his unmaking. The next thing he knows people are walking through him and hes traveling through walls. The ghosts here gather around Bertram like the Verizon network gang. ""Can you hear us now? Can you?"" they demand. And what sorrows they express. Yes the dour dentist can see dead people but he doesnt care for the gift and dodges the restless souls requests at every turn. Like the other ghosts Frank wants a favor from the reluctant go-between. He enlists Bertram in a plan to scuttle his widow Gwens relationship to Richard a seemingly decent if mildly humorless good guy played by Billy Campbell. Naturally more than supernaturally Bertram begins to have feelings for Gwen. Kinnear proves just right as Frank. Audiences must dislike his sins but have a soft spot for the sinner. Terrific in ""Spanglish"" Leoni is one of the finest screen comedians working (not nearly enough) today. The husk in her voice her fondness for the physical goofs of comedy make her attuned to the screwball pitches being lobbed here. She knows her way around the details. So when Gwen sees the price tag hanging on Bertrams newly purchased shirt her face registers sweet gentleness. Indeed the movie floats on instances of oh-so-human yearnings. Dana Ivey is especially touching as an anxious spirit who wants to get a message to one of her daughters. Who doesnt ache at the notion that someone out there is trying to free those of us left here of our grief anger and self-recrimination? Still there are times when audiences may wonder if the movie stands a ghost of a chance of arriving at the resolution it looks to be heading toward. Like Frank we rather doubt the vivacious Gwen will fall for the cranky D.D.S. Its not just that Gervais isnt your typical leading guy. Hes not and bravo. Its more that Koepp and Gervais hold tight to Bertrams unpleasantness and human clumsiness after most other films would have winked at their intentions. Its a patience that rewards audiences. One audiences should reward in kind. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedy denverpost.com.

Comments Ghost Town After dying on the operating table and being brought back to life an obnoxious Manhattan dentist (Ricky Gervais) discovers that he can see dead people and they all want his assistance in resolving their unfinished business. Like his fellow Brit Steve Coogan Gervais became a star playing insufferable oafs on the BBC (The Office Extras) and has since graduated to high-profile gigs in a Hollywood that seems intent on domesticating him. In this comedy by David Koepp Gervais handles the big crowd-pleasing gags with aplomb though the only scenes that approach the edgy wit of his TV work are those he shares with fellow improvisers Aasif Mandvi (The Daily Show With Jon Stewart) and Kristen Wiig (Saturday Night Live). With Greg Kinnear and Tea Leoni. PG-13 102 min. By J.R. Jones Now Playing Sorry there are no upcoming showtimes for Ghost Town Reviews/comments Subscribe to this thread By Email Subscribing...

"Gervais keeps Ghost alive - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Gervais keeps Ghost alive Ricky Gervais (above with Tea Leoni) plays a misanthrope whose dislike of humankind extends to the dead. (Sarah Shatz) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / September 19 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Someone once said about W.C. Fields that he had the rare ability to despise amusingly. I can imagine no greater compliment than to say that Ricky Gervais seems at his best like a young Fields. They both have the same blocky bulldog head for one thing but where the older comic muttered Gervais turns dithering into an art form. He expresses himself in stop-and-start arias of half-sentences half phrases half-words half-phonemes pirouetting here into rapier-edged insult and there into sublime high nonsense. Gervaiss sensibility is that of a juggler as Fieldss was and his malice toward all is just as graceful.""Ghost Town"" is an attempt to stuff this character into the box of a Hollywood leading man. Needless to say that doesnt go very well. Yet the movies a surprisingly pleasurable trifle a formulaic but spry comedy-fantasy that runs into trouble only when it starts taking itself too seriously. The director and co-writer is David Koepp who has written many blockbusters (""Spider-Man"" ""Jurassic Park"" and so forth) and directed a few suspense stinkers (""Secret Window"" ""Stir of Echoes""); its his breeziest work yet.The setup is a rehash of ""The Sixth Sense"" by way of ""Topper"" Gervais sees dead people and he finds them tedious beyond measure. His character Bertram Pincus D.D.S. is a British-born Manhattan dentist and the kind of fellow who closes the elevator doors when he sees someone else rushing up. A nasty little man and quite happily so.After clinically dying for seven minutes during a routine colonoscopy (Kristen Wiigs his doctor doing droll but thin ""SNL"" things with her part) Bertram develops the ability to see the thousands of undead who walk the streets of New York City. They look like you or me - or to be precise like familiar character actors such as Dana Ivey and Alan Ruck - and theyre as shocked as he that he can see them.The most persistent ghost is Frank (Greg Kinnear) a Master of the Universe type who was cheating on his wife before he died and who now wants Bertram to break up her pending remarriage. Tea Leoni plays the widow an Egyptian mummy specialist named Gwen and when the dentist gets a look at her hes instantly smitten. Ricky Gervais in love? Say it aint so.It aint and it is. Gwens fiance is a fatally earnest human rights lawyer (Billy Campbell) and the minute Koepp gets these three at a dinner table (along with a Great Dane the size of a bison) we can see why Gwen might be attracted to this lumpy middle-aged British misanthrope. Quite simply Bertram gives her the giggles. The ever-underrated Leoni responds so delightfully to the stars acerbic flights of whimsy that the two carve out a subversive space within a conventional movie. Theyre a confederacy of goofballs.As Frank and the other ghosts press Bertram to help them find closure Kinnear and Gervais make an amusing if ultimately tiring comic team. Leoni and Gervais are far better company but I regret to inform you that ""Ghost Town"" takes a turn for the somber in the final half-hour. The movie even suggests that a Ricky Gervais character might turn over a new leaf discover he has a heart and start dispensing the milk of human kindness.To which I say Heresy.By the time Bertrams dental colleague (Aasif Mandvi) is pulling out his inspirational Albert Einstein posters and the dialogue has started ripping off ""Tootsie"" (""I was a better man with you as a woman"" becomes ""I was more alive with you after I was dead"" etc.) you realize even Koepp has stopped believing in his movie. All that sustains ""Ghost Town"" by then is the afterglow of Gervaiss marvelous all-encompassing bile. Somewhere W.C. Fields must be applauding Anyone who hates public-interest lawyers and dogs cant be all bad. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Nothing is funnier than a sociopathic dentist wielding a drill right? If the drill is held by comedian Ricky Gervais the answer might be yes. Although ""Ghost Town"" seems committed to adding another nail in the coffin of the battered reputation of good-natured dentists everywhere it quickly softens into the lighthearted fare promised by most romantic comedies. It makes good on the cliche ""itll make you laugh; itll make you cry"" by providing clever comedy and stock sentimentality without feeling tired. Callous dentist Dr. Bertram Pincus played by the hard-to-hate Gervais will do anything to avoid connecting with other human beings. His natural knack for insensitivity shines through in almost every social occasion with patients colleagues and next-door neighbors. Pincus maintains a tightly controlled world of solitude until he goes in for a routine colonoscopy only to emerge with a parodied version of ""The Sixth Sense."" Suddenly all the dead souls in Manhattan with unresolved business are seeking out Pincus as their only connection to the world of the living. The most persistent is Frank (Greg Kinnear) who dogs the poor doctor night and day to help him hijack the impending marriage of his widow Gwen (Tea Leoni). In order to regain order in his life Pincus resigns to abandon his misanthropy long enough to satiate Franks wishes. Pincus is of course not the cad hes made out to be as he melts into a smart quick-witted charmer for the sake of Gwen. As a matter of fact hes downright adorable in his un-self-conscious manner as he trots off to functions in his dentist smock and makes hilarious attempts to be heartless. Fans of Gervais will revel in his performance that saves ""Ghost Town"" from being a by-the-numbers formulaic comedy. Director/writer David Koepp ventures into more crowd-pleasing territory from his previous suspense thrillers ""Stir of Echoes"" and ""Secret Window"" deftly providing whip-smart dialogue and quirky sarcasm that works seamlessly with Gervais. A scene in the hospital where Pincus is trying to figure out just what happened during his procedure that now allows him to see dead people is pitch-perfect. The fact that the unconventional humor almost totally gives over to the predictable tugs at the heartstrings is regrettable only because the satire is so fresh and the drama is not.

But Ghost Town despite being set in modern-day New York feels downright ancient. Ostensibly a comedy but one in which the (normally) brilliantly funny Ricky Gervais is more dull than he is droll Ghost Town takes a familiar formula and goes nowhere with it. Gervais affectless and aloof is Bertram Pincus a socially challenged Fifth Avenue dentist with a selfish cynical view of the world. But when he awakens in a hospital room - having been anesthetized for a colonoscopy - Pincus suddenly finds that he can see and communicate with the dead. (Another good reason not to have your large intestine poked around in.) Any old soul left in limbo in Manhattan is now visible to the good dentist - and the streets are teeming with these restless spirits seeking closure before they can go off to wherever their final resting place might be. Pincus of course wants nothing to do with them but one persistent specter Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear) wont take no for an answer. He needs Pincus to thwart the imminent marriage of Gwen (TA(c)a Leoni) - Franks widow and Pincus apartment building neighbor. Never mind that Frank had been cheating on Gwen before he died he cant stand the thought of her wedding a cad like Richard (Billy Campbell). And so because David Koepps screenplay says so cranky Pincus after being nagged and needled by Frank sets out to court Gwen. She turns out to be witty and acerbic with a dark oddball sense of humor and not unexpectedly Pincus takes to her and she to Pincus. But many obstacles - the dentists dire view of humankind for one and that fiancA(c) for another - stand in the way before Ghost Town can toddle off to its happy conclusion. Gervais does show flashes of amusing snarkiness (his post-op discussions with a doctor played by Kristen Wiig are deadpan and funny). And the quiet bemused way in which he comports himself is remindful of Alec Guinness in those Ealing Studio comedies The Ladykillers and The Lavender Hill Mob. (So is Gervais haircut.) And Leoni cool and snappy appears to be enjoying herself. But the films very banality sinks its stars while Kinnear as the spectral adulterer trying to make things right is just doing his usual Kinnear thing. Koepp an A-list screenwriter whose previous directing efforts have mostly been small shadowy thrillers seems to be going for the opposite of manic with Ghost Town. (One of those Koepp pics Stir of Echoes starred Kevin Bacon as a guy who sees ghosts.) But while an easygoing sophisticated comedy is an admirable goal theres a fine line between relaxed and somnambulistic and Ghost Town crosses over it like a jaywalker about to get hit by a bus.

He has established this through television series he has created - the original version of The Office is surely one of the best things the medium has ever offered and Extras which also was brilliant. He reaffirms his status with his performance in Ghost Town. The material isnt up to the standards of his own creations - David Koepp directed and co-wrote the film; in an unusual outing for Gervais hes just a star for hire. But he definitely was the right star to hire. On the surface Ghost Town is a cute sweet romantic comedy with supernatural trappings. Fairly pedestrian right? It even features Greg Kinnear in a major role. Could a movie sound more generic? Yet its Gervais as a self-centered New York dentist who can see dead people who elevates the film. Hes not exactly central-casting romantic-lead material but he compensates for it with a sense of humor that makes him immensely likable giving Ghost Town the boost it requires to rise above mediocrity. Kinnear plays Frank a selfish rich man whos cheating on his wife and is promptly killed. He returns as a ghost still dressed in his tux wandering New York with the rest of the dead-but-not-yet-gone crowd (which evidently is quite large). Eventually Frank will come into contact with Gervais Bertram Pincus whos perfectly content to be self-contained seeing patients in his office then walking next door to his immaculate soulless apartment. Bertram goes in for a routine colonoscopy after which he suddenly starts seeing dead people including Frank. Turns out he had one of those dead-for-a-few-moments experiences explained with uproarious distraction by his doctor (a hilarious Kristen Wiig) with lawyer in tow. Thus the ability to see ghosts - and the meddling from Frank who wants Bertram to break up the impending marriage between his widow Gwen (Ta Leoni) and the alarmingly serious Richard (Billy Campbell). Bertrams willing to try in exchange for Frank and all the other dead people leaving him alone (they need him to help with their unfinished business before they can move on). But hes such a misanthrope clueless when it comes to dealing with anyone whose mouth he doesnt have his dental instruments inserted into that its tough sledding. Is he successful? What do you think? (You saw the words ""romantic comedy"" above.) Koepp who wrote Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Spider-Man and Panic Room among many other films isnt out to reinvent anything here. He wisely leaves that to Gervais. Like the latters characters in The Office and Extras Bertram has had some measure of success (more than those actually) but cant seem to realize his dreams. Which in Bertrams case consist mostly of being left alone so the constant visits from the gaggle of ghosts are particularly galling to him. Gervais and Leoni have a nice chemistry and are clearly having fun. Gervais has said several scenes were largely improvised; in one Bertram is talking to and about Gwens mammoth dog and Leoni cant keep a straight face. In some films thats annoying. Here its infectious. Yet for all that for all of Gervais yeoman work to make Ghost Town a movie worth seeing (a task at which he ultimately succeeds) in the end it just whets your appetite for the next project he creates.

"Ricky Gervais in Ghost Town reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Ricky Gervais in Ghost Town reviewed. Ricky Gervais in Ghost Town reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 18 2008 1142 AM Dead People Are Irritating The new Ricky Gervais comedy Ghost Town. By Dana Stevens Ricky Gervais in Ghost Town Ghost Town (DreamWorks) a romantic comedy about a haunted dentist in New York City doesnt do justice to the manifold gifts of Ricky Gervais the co-creator and star of the BBC series The Office and HBOs Extras. Then again giving Gervais the American star vehicle he deserves might be too much to ask. When hes performing his own material according to his own rules Gervais is capable of comic sublimity. (Im one of those Office purists who still refuses to watch the American version; why remake perfection?) Hes less at ease in the lab-rat maze of a formulaic romance. Still Ghost Town has inspired casting a few memorable scenes and enough laughs that mainstream U.S. audiences may finally get the point of that doughy English guy with the pointy canine teeth and the high-pitched giggle. The story meeting for this movie must have run long. Its The Sixth Sense played for laughs Its A Christmas Carol if Scrooge were a dentist Theres hardly a ghost-themed movie of the last century that doesnt contribute at least something to the mix. But most of all Ghost Town recalls the 1937 film Topper in which Cary Grant and Constance Bennett played two debonair ghouls about town who return from the beyond to show the stuffy title character how to live a little. Advertisement Ghost Towns chief revenant like Toppers is a tuxedoed cad who regards being dead as a blasted inconvenience. Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear) happens to get run over by a bus on the same day that his wife Gwen (Tea Leoni) discovers hes been cheating on her. Wandering the streets of New York Frank realizes hes invisible to the living but surrounded by other unquiet souls with scores to settle. Meanwhile Bertram Pincus (Gervais) a deeply misanthropic and perpetually angry dentist is preparing to undergo a routine colonoscopy. After he briefly dies on the operating table (a fact withheld from him by his passive-aggressive doctor a hilarious Kristen Wiig) Bertram wakes up with a paranormal gift. He sees dead people and he finds them really irritating. The stretch of the movie that follows in which Frank convinces Bertram to prevent Gwens upcoming wedding to a stodgy human rights lawyer (Billy Campbell) is an uphill climb. Its never clear why Frank a fairly unpleasant fellow is able to press his case more convincingly than all the other ghosts who besiege Bertram with their requests. And Gervais character in the early scenes is so silent and dour that the actor has no chance to exercise the foot-in-mouth logorrhea that is his specialty. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. But once Leonis Gwen comes on the scene the movie starts to bubble along nicely. Not just because Leoni is a screwball heroine worth er screwballing--at 42 shes more attractive than ever--but because her character is given a weight and texture thats rare in a movie of this type. Gwen is an up-and-coming Egyptologist whos curating a big show at the Met while quietly pining for her dead unfaithful husband. She admires her lantern-jawed do-gooding boyfriend but cant bring herself to laugh at his jokes. The scenes between Leoni and Gervais--most notably one in which they examine a mummy together--lift the occasionally pedestrian script to another level. Its a sad comment on the state of romantic comedy when you find yourself thinking Wow in this one I can actually see why the two leads like each other Every ghost story is really a story about mourning which is why the genre will never die. David Koepp directing from his own script is best known as a screenwriter of blockbusters (Spider-Man and the last Indiana Jones movie) but he also made the delicately spooky 1999 thriller Stir of Echoes which touched upon some of the same themes as Ghost Town What do the living owe the dead and how can those stuck on both sides of the divide learn to let go? Ghost Town doesnt rank among the great ghost-themed movies; its no Ugetsu or Truly Madly Deeply. The metaphysical questions it does raise get resolved too quickly and neatly even for a comedy. But the last two lines of dialogue may be the best kicker Ive heard in a movie this year. They leave us convinced that Tea Leoni catch that she is could go weak in the knees for the likes of Ricky Gervais. If theyre smart American audiences will too.

The British comic plays Bertram Pincus a misanthropic dentist in New York City who develops an ability to see dead people; to be specific the dead are noodgy solid-looking ghosts of the type that populated the Cary Grant movie Topper. Each has unfinished? business with the living for which they want Pincus to act as intermediary -- and none ?is noodgier than a slick businessman (Greg Kinnear) who was cheating on his wife (Tea Leoni) when he bit the dust. Now the remorseful dead cad wants the living dentist to stop the good widows impending second marriage to an unsuitably dull fellow (Billy Campbell). Gervais who created (with Stephen Merchant) the inimitable original BBC version of The Office and starred unforgettably as ?incompetent boss David Brent specializes in the hilarity of human discomfort; hes a performer who works best when supported by characters as sharp and fully drawn as ?he is. Here though director David Koepp (the A-list screenwriter of Spider-Man working from his own script) handles Gervais with nervous delicacy as if the star is an odd import whose striking foreign comedic? persona needs to be cushioned by squishier more familiar American displays of mildness. (Kinnear and Leoni too are muted.) Maybe now Gervais can do his own sitcom about a unique British comedian who comes to conquer Hollywood only to find himself cast in a generic 1930s-type happy-ending romp about dentists and noodgy ghosts.

"Ghost Town | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ghost-town ) Ghost Town (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Ghost Town is one of those romantic comedies that never quite clicks. At times its humor is effective provoking chuckles and laughs. At other times the comedy feels forced and awkward. The romantic element is equally hit-and-miss. The chemistry that emerges between the leads during the films second half is largely absent from the first 45 minutes. And the premise rich with promise and pregnant with possibilities is reduced to a plot device that allows Ghost Town to turn into a low-rent modern-day version of A Christmas Carol. The movies opening scene is a winner with philanderer Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear) having a phone conversation with his wife Gwen (TA(c)a Leoni) who has just discovered hes having an affair. Frank wraps up the call just as the curtain falls on his time on Earth. Director David Koepp orchestrates his end brilliantly with a sleight-of-hand that is both funny and surprising. However instead of making his way to the next life Frank finds himself stuck in Manhattan as a ghost. He can see and hear everything but is invisible and unable to do more than observe. Enter Bertram Pincus D.D.S. (Ricky Gervais) the most unpleasant dentist in the city. Something unfortunate happens to Bertram during a routine colonoscopy. He has a bad reaction to the anesthesia and ""dies."" The hospital staff is able to revive him and hes released in good condition but theres an unfortunate side-effect Bertram like a plus-sized British version of Haley Joel Osment can see dead people. As soon as they realize they have a connection to the world of the living the ghosts converge on Bertram. Frank offers him a deal do one thing for him and Frank will make sure the ghosts leave Bertram alone. Gwen is about to marry someone who Frank believes is after her only because of her money so the goal is for Bertram to foil the union. Predictably the rest of the film is about Bertram falling for Gwen and how the dentists interaction with the dead transforms him into a better person. God bless us every one. For the most part Ricky Gervais is better known in the U.K. than in the United States but hes not exactly cast against type here. Bertram is a singularly unpleasant individual who makes Scrooge seem sociable. Hes a prig a snob and an antisocial asshole. Ghost Towns conceit is that he will be redeemed by the time the end credits roll and the more unpleasant he is to start with the more positively the audience will react to his transformation. Theres some truth to that but the problem is that the movie is devised to be a romantic comedy and its very difficult to warm up to a romance when one half of the couple is so thoroughly unlikeable. Its also impossible to respect a woman who will even begin to fall for a man like that. Its not as if Bertram only shows his good side to Gwen. The first time he sees her he slams an elevator door in her face. The second time he steals her cab. In most successful romantic comedies the audience likes both protagonists even if they dont like each other. Its a risk to present someone like Bertram who we hope will share Franks fate then ask us to do an about-face regarding him half-way through the movie. Ghost Towns comedy is maddeningly inconsistent. Masterful sequences such as the opening one in which Frank meets his demise are interspersed with episodes that not only dont work on a comedic level but run on for too long. Consider for example an interchange between Bertram and his doctor (played by Kristen Wiig) in which both continuously interrupt each other. Like a bad unfunny segment of Saturday Night Live this drags on seemingly without end becoming increasingly frustrating with every new interruption. Comedy is supposed to be funny not annoying. In many cases the way the ghosts are used (or not used) feels like a wasted opportunity. Ultimately their purpose is to help Bertram recognize the hollowness of his existence and place him on the path to redemption. His final ""revelation"" about the nature of their existence is underwhelming. Its as if Koepps screenplay underwent some kind of sanitizing process that eliminated any potentially controversial or edgy issues. Concepts of spirituality and God arent addressed on any level which seems an odd omission when one considers the movie is about death the afterlife and salvation. The movie doesnt have to preach but the omission of such matters feels odd. Those who take a glass half-full approach to Ghost Town will probably enjoy it the most. There is romance there is comedy and there is a feel-good ending. For some those things will be enough and the fact that theyre not as well developed or effectively nurtured as they might be will not be a significant detraction. Ultimately however the movie cries out for an offbeat approach such as the one Marc Forster utilized in Stranger than Fiction. Ghost Towns unwillingness to escape from a safe orbit keeps the movie trapped in mediocrity.

During the opening minutes of the film--an occasionally effective mash-up of Ghost The Sixth Sense and The Frighteners--Gervais is nearly mute as Bertram Pincus D.D.S. a dentist who enjoys his work because it allows him the peace and quiet that comes with sticking cotton balls into his patients mouths. Hes a ""sad little man"" says one observer; ""a fucking prick"" says another. But following a brief period of death on an operating table Bertram sees dead people. And the dead of course bring him back to life--especially Greg Kinnears tuxedoed Frank offed while shouting down the realtor who revealed his affair. Frank latches onto Bertram in the desperate hope that he can bust up the remarriage of his widow (Tea Leoni). If it sounds all so pale and predictable it is. Director and co-writer David Koepp more or less remaking his 1999 film Stir of Echoes with a romantic comedys dopey grin this time does little to break with the genres conventions. But Ghost Town dead on arrival throughout much of its first half picks up as it slows down--when it ditches the decidedly dreary romantic slapshtick of the living and focuses however briefly on the needy aching dead.

This light enjoyable romantic comedy is filmed here in the home of Woody and Seinfeld whose awful personal characteristics never stopped them from seducing a girl either. Playing a crass people-hating dentist Gervais begins to see annoying ghosts and eventually worms his unctuous way into Tea Leonis heart. -- Sara Cardace Related Stories Featured In Qamp;A With Ghost Town Star Ricky Gervais (9/22/08) Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick The Great British Baking Show Recap Rough Puff Outcast Recap Sympathy For the Devil The Great British Baking Show Recap Lady Fingers TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

Smartly supernatural and featuring sensational performances by Ricky Gervais and Tea Leoni ""Ghost Town"" is a ""Topper"" for our times and will probably do for Gervais what his previous projects havent -- namely brand the Emmy-winning Brit comic in America as a source of sophisticated snarky fun. The proper tweaking by Paramount could make for major B.O. The philandering Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear) is walking along a Manhattan street when he steps in front of a bus to avoid being hit by a falling air conditioner. ""Is he dead?"" someone asks. ""He isnt happy"" someone answers. For us Frank rematerializes as one of the myriad ghosts walking around Manhattan with unfinished business -- in Franks case the happiness of his widow Gwen (Leoni). Flash forward to Bertram Pincus (Gervais) a dentist whos all scrubbed cheeks and misanthropy having what should be a routine colonoscopy -- the lead-up to which is hysterical -- but instead leaves Bertram with a question Who were all those people in his room? When he starts seeing dead people and they realize he can see them they start following him around becoming an annoyance the fussy Bertram can barely tolerate. One of the spirits following Bertram around is Frank who wants Bertram to break off Gwens engagement to another man. The long unloved Bertram falls for her of course and their romance though not untroubled is as charming as the rest of the movie. Helmer David Koepp has created a fantasy New York thats underpopulated (by the living) but it fits Gervais perfectly. The script by Koepp and John Kamps works backward and forward Only after its revealed that Bertram can see the dead does it become clear why he was asking about the crowd in his hospital room where people have been dying for years. (In fact frequent medical malpractice has led to high turnover ""We have a very strict three-strikes policy"" says his doctor played by a delightful Kristen Wiig.) But Koepp isnt afraid to explore ""Ghost Towns"" mournful subtext -- some of its characters are after all dead -- which makes the humor all the more biting. It also provides for the occasional moment of genuine pathos Frank thinks his affairs have gone unnoticed by Gwen and they havent. That revelation is handled with great delicacy and sadness; Gervais is there luckily to readjust the mood. Leoni has developed into perhaps our most Capra-esque comedienne and her chemistry with Gervais is potent even if she does act like a human laugh track for Bertram at the beginning of their relationship. ""Ghost Town"" is something of a love letter to New York which assumes one of its many incarnations under Koepp namely Autumnal Paradise. Even dead people walking the Upper East Side cant dull the effect. Production values are superb.
