Comments (3) Just Go With It Video Rated PG-13  116 minutes  2011 Jennifer Aniston has starred in so many lame romantic comedies that shes become an industry punch line but drop her into an Adam Sandler movie and she comes off like Katharine Hepburn. Sandler is a cosmetic surgeon whos always posed as a married man to attract women; after meeting the blond hottie of his dreams he persuades Aniston his office manager to pose as his wife so he can persuasively divorce her. The story originated as a French play and was later turned into Cactus Flower (1969) a Hollywood film scripted by Billy Wilders partner in crime I.A.L. Diamond; watching Anistons sharp verbal timing you wonder if this might have been a great comedy without Sandler and his Botox gags. Nicole Kidman has a supporting comic role as the office managers ""frenemy"" from college another reason to keep up the ruse and Kidmans frenetic performance makes you appreciate Anistons deft touch even more.

"Ann Hornaday reviews Just Go With It with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Ann Hornaday reviews Just Go With It with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler in the unfunny ""Just Go With It."" (Tracy Bennett/columbia Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity Your Feedback Corrections suggestions? TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 11 2011; 926 PM There are two Adam Sandlers in the film world the brave edgy Sandler who finds unexpected pathos in such outliers as ""Punch Drunk Love"" ""Spanglish"" and ""Funny People."" And the complacent lazy Sandler of last summers ""Grown Ups"" and now ""Just Go With It"" an egregiously unfunny enterprise that seem less crafted than extruded through the great product-mill that is Hollywood at its most homogenized and soulless. This time out Sandler plays a Los Angeles plastic surgeon named Danny Maccabee whose back story plays out in ""Just Go With Its"" first few scenes The victim of a scheming two-timing bride-to-be the long-shnozzed Danny flees her clutches at the altar then finds that his wedding ring and hard-luck story works like catnip with the ladies. Jump cut to a couple of decades later when a post-nose-job Danny is still working that grift on unsuspecting girls 20 years his junior. (That earlier sequence is surely intended to build sympathy for a protagonist whos otherwise deceitful selfish infantile and amoral. But I digress.) When one of Dannys conquests turns out to be true love and she finds his decoy wedding ring the quick-thinking Lothario dragoons his long-suffering assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) and her precocious kids to play his soon-to-be-estranged family thereby freeing him to marry the woman of his dreams. That shiksa goddess by the way is played by Sports Illustrated supermodel Brooklyn Decker here in full Bo Derek mode (ask your parents) as an ideal of blond buxom womanhood who on at least two occasions strikes Venus-like poses against seductive watery backdrops. Making her film debut here Decker acquits herself with disarming sincerity and sweetness in a movie that once everyone decamps for an impromptu vacation seems to have been designed chiefly as a Hawaii getaway for Sandler and his handpicked friends. Thanks to Dannys profession ""Just Go With It"" contains predictable sight gags involving plastic surgery gone horribly wrong including one unsavory bit in which Sandler and Aniston rub numbing cream on a patients nipples. In between crass product placements for Pizza Hut and Pepsi writers Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling cram in as many references to pooping and peepee as possible all the while making ""Just Go With It"" sophomoric enough to appeal to kids and raunchy enough to make it inappropriate for them. To her credit Aniston who meets Decker toe-to-toe (except they arent toes) in a lagoon bikini-off midway through the film brings little more to ""Just Go With It"" than her famously taut physique; but blandness is clearly the order of the day for a film that aspires to nothing save padding Sandlers bank account. (To his dubious credit hes made it a point in his last few films to play obscenely wealthy men saving us all the discomfort of watching him pretend to be anything but.) Nick Swardson as Dannys pesty cousin Eddie does an absolutely spot-on impression of Sacha Baron Cohen doing Bruno in the most ludicrous story line of a film that obeys no narrative rules save those that come as plot points that are preprogrammed into screenwriting software (physical shtick with a comatose sheep check). The only A-game in ""Just Go With It"" comes by way of its least likely player Nicole Kidman in a weird piece of stunt casting tucks into her cameo role with the predatory glee of her ""To Die For"" days. In fact just thinking about Kidman traveling from the heights of ""To Die For"" to the depths of ""Just Go With It"" inspires an idea Just dont. Just Go With It r (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for frequent crude and sexual content partial nudity brief drug references and profanity.

And still with the bar set as low as a limbo contest on the beach Just Go With It is a bummer -- slack rather than loose tired rather than fun. Only in such a nearsighted universe is Jennifer Aniston not hot enough for Sandler. He plays Danny a middle-aged plastic surgeon whose near-marriage years ago to a cheating gold-digger has left him too burned to fall in love. Still hes player enough to wear a wedding ring as a way to bag sympathetic chicks attracted to his sweet-goof brand of married man looking for temporary comfort. Aniston is Katherine Dannys loyal (as well as funny smart pretty grown-up) office nurse/assistant a divorced mother of two young kids who rolls her eyes at her bosss transparent pick-up ways. His game works until Danny meets a sweet young bombshell named Palmer (swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker more than living up to script requirements). Danny thinks Palmer might be The One except she thinks hes married so he needs to invent a story about how hes getting a divorce and then Palmer (an ethical knockout -- and a sixth grade math teacher) insists on meeting his ex-wife-to-be. Soon Katherine is passing as Dannys wife Danny is pretending Katherines kids are his own (Palmer luvvvvs kids) and theyre all in Hawaii (vacation for the production crew) along with Dannys cousin Eddie (Nick Swardson) who pretends to be Katherines German boyfriend. Then they all run into Nicole Kidman playing Katherines college nemesis and musician Dave Matthews as her husband -- a whole other story. Just Go With It is based on the 1969 movie Cactus Flower (starring Goldie Hawn in the bombshell role); the movie was adapted from Abe Burrows Broadway hit of the same name; and Burrows took his inspiration from Fleur de cactus a French farce. But you can say adieu and aloha to all farce here French-style or otherwise. Theres no place for sharp zing in a smile-y script in which everyone is blandly nice even when theyre lying and cheating. The scenes with the kids (played by child actors Bailee Madison and Griffin Gluck) cloy like jellybeans stuck in teeth. The scenes with Kidman (out to have a lark as a comedienne) look like comedy-class exercises. A talent competition in which Kidman and Aniston join other female hotel guests in demonstrating their hula dance moves is vaguely humiliating to every lady involved. (Those voted off the stage early include a shriveled old woman and a plain fat one.) The movie is saved from utter disaster though by Jennifer Aniston. Shes got expert comic timing when all those around her have none; shes got lightness and finesse when everyone else is being indulgently silly. She plays like a grown-up; she looks fab. And she gets a real commitment out of Sandler -- her performance makes him grow up too. Amidst the wreckage of Just Go With It Aniston and Sandler have a real chemistry. They should go elsewhere with it.

Just Go With It Fair Director Dennis Dugan. Cast Adam Sandler Jennifer Aniston Brooklyn Decker. Rating Rated PG-13 for frequent crude and sexual content partial nudity brief drug references and language. Guide to this weeks new releases Spotlight Adam Sandler | Jennifer Aniston Sexy movie beach bodies As romantic comedies go ""Just Go with It"" the latest Adam Sandler vehicle is strictly unsurprising middle-of-the-road fare. But compared with much of his recent work self-indulgent messes such as ""Grown Ups"" and ""You Dont Mess with the Zohan"" its practically ""Citizen Kane."" Perhaps this is because Sandler didnt write the script and the cast isnt entirely populated by old ""Saturday Night Live"" buddies for whom he is doing a favor by putting them in his movies. Instead the film directed by longtime Sandler collaborator Dennis Dugan is based on the 1969 movie ""Cactus Flower"" which was based on a Broadway play that was based on a French play. You will be happy to learn that Rob Schneider appears in none of the incarnations. Sandler plays Danny a plastic surgeon who learned on his wedding day that his would-be bride was marrying him for the money he would eventually make. He walked away from the wedding and discovered while getting drunk in a bar that his wedding ring was a chick magnet. So for years hes used a wedding ring to snare women creating bizarre stories around his fantasy wife to win if not the hearts of beautiful women at least the rest of them. His straight-shooting level-headed single-mom assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) is aware of this because they share everything. We can stop right here if you like; you now know everything you need to about where this will lead. No? The promise of supermodels in bikinis beckons? Onward then. At a party Danny meets the much-younger Palmer (Brooklyn Decker the aforementioned supermodel); a one-night stand promises something more. Only she finds his wedding ring. He cant very well tell her its a prop so he lies telling her hes getting divorced. Now all he needs is a fake wife. Enter Katherine an exceedingly good sport who agrees to play the role. Soon the lie has escalated to include her children (Bailee Madison and Griffin Gluck both adorable) and leads to a trip to Hawaii where Danny evidently blind all these years discovers that Katherine doesnt look bad in a bikini either. Oh and shes also all-around fantastic. Also along for the trip is Dannys nutty cousin Eddie (the hilarious Nick Swardson) who pretends to be Katherines new boyfriend a sheep salesman named Dolph Lundgren. While in Hawaii because why not Katherine runs into her college nemesis the pathologically competitive Devlin (Nicole Kidman - yes that Nicole Kidman) which leads to Katherine cooking up some lies of her own. Its all ridiculous of course but its meant to be. Sandler is best in snarky asides. Kidman has fun in a small role. Decker well she does look good in a bikini but acting would not appear to be her strong suit. Aniston the most sympathetic adult character by a long shot is good enough to keep you thinking that one day shes going to finally find the perfect movie vehicle. This isnt it. ""Just Go with It"" provides not only the title of the film but a one-step instruction for how best to enjoy it. Thats more than we might expect from Sandler lately but its still setting the bar awfully low. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Just Go with It | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; just-go-with-it ) Just Go with It (United States 2011) February 12 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli The experience of sitting through Just Go with It Adam Sandlers umpteenth comedy directed by good buddy Dennis Dugan is akin to watching a bad sit-com that never ends. With some TV shows commercial breaks provide welcome relief from the monotony of enduring the main attraction but there is no such respite for viewers of Just Go with It unless it involves faking bladder problems and hiding out in the rest room. In some instances that might be the preferable choice. I was one of the few defenders of the previous Sandler/Dugan collaboration Grown Ups because it felt almost like an exercise in comedic improv performed by a group of old friends in the service of a minimalist plot. I cannot however excuse the misfire that Just Go with It represents. This remake of a 1969 Walter Matthau movie (which in turn was an adaptation of an American version of a French stage play) has been so completely ""Sandler-ized"" that little of the source remains which is just as well for all those involved in various earlier incarnations. The blame for the failure of Just Go with It falls squarely upon the shoulders of those in charge of this interpretation. Sandler is perhaps not an ideal romantic lead - it probably has something to do with the state of arrested adolescence in which many of his characters find themselves - but that hasnt stopped him from making his share of romantic comedies a few of which have been respectable (50 First Dates comes to mind). With this outing however the filmmakers have forgotten the 1 rule of the genre the lovers must be shown to believably fall for each other. Just Go with It decides to dispose with such an old-fashioned approach and take a short cut. Because the leads are Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston it is assumed that these two will fall in love so why bother with any romance? After all the movie runs long enough as it is so skipping the scenes in which the two friends gradually cross the line can be dispensed with and except for one admittedly nice conversation in which the two engage the story can make a bee-line for the happy ending. So that no one might mistake Nicole Kidman for the romantic lead thereby jeopardizing the obviousness of Jennifer Anistons claim to that role she is not introduced until the movie is half over. She would have been better advised not to have been introduced until the movie is completely over. If she was the Best Actress Oscar front-runner for Rabbit Hole which she is not Just Go with It could have been her Norbit. Its easy to see how the premise could provide the foundation for a passable romantic comedy; in fact its hard to see how things could go this far wrong. Danny (Sandler) is an elite plastic surgeon and a confirmed commitment-phobe. The former makes him one of the most important people in Los Angeles; the latter is nothing out of the ordinary especially in Hollywoods version of reality. He has a foolproof method of assuring a series of one-night stands with girls half his age wear a pretend wedding ring. His amorous targets fall for his sad tale of how he is a neglected and sometimes abused husband while recognizing theres no long-term hope for an entanglement. Its pity sex with no strings attached. Dannys assistant Katherine (Aniston) regards her boss love life with ill-disguised disgust but that doesnt prevent her from secretly pining for a future with him. Then Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) enters Dannys life and after a night with her he believes shes ""the one."" Unfortunately she has seen the ring and the explanation he provides - that he and his wife are getting a divorce - isnt sufficient to allay her fears about falling for a married man. So to prove his truthfulness he must produce a wife. In a town full of actors Danny chooses Katherine to play this part. The simple deception however becomes increasingly complicated with the addition of two children and a Teutonic lover (actually Dannys cousin Eddie played by Nick Swardson in a role that seems custom-written for Rob Schneider). Once the scene shifts to Hawaii Nicole Kidman joins the party as a college rival of Katherines. There arent any good performances to be discovered in Just Go with It with mediocrity being the highest level any of the actors strive for. Kidman arguably the most accomplished of the films thespians offers the most unappealing turn with a portrayal that is nails-on-the-blackboard shrill. She is given a run for her money by Nick Swardson who accomplishes the unthinkable of being more annoying than Rob Schneider could likely have been. Brooklyn Decker was cast for reasons too obvious to mention (the Andy Roddick cameo is a bonus). The kids are either awful or underdirected; its tough to tell which. Sandler and Aniston are Sandler and Aniston. They play variations of characters whose skins they have inhabited for so long that its impossible for them not to be at least moderately convincing. The lack of a romantic connection is likely more the fault of the screenplay than of a failing on their parts. There is a spark (although no smoke or fire) in the productions single successful romantic scene. Those attending Just Go with It with the expectation of enjoying nearly two hours of Sandlers sophomoric antics will be disappointed. This is a more ""adult Sandler"" and the level of crudeness is surprisingly light (although there is one gag involving a dozing man with his hand in a toilet and a sleepy boy who feels the call of nature). Maybe a little more gross-out humor would have helped Just Go with It if only to relieve the tedium associated with a movie whose sole purpose seems to be to find new ways to extend a one-hour story into a two-hour insomnia cure. Its difficult to determine who might be pleased by this movie Sandler fans wont like the neutering of their hero comedy lovers will be disappointed by the tepid level of humor and rom-com devotees will be annoyed by the bungling of a staple storyline.

By Peter Rainer February 11 2011 Save for later Saved Bailee Madison Adam Sandler and Griffin Gluck are shown in a scene from Just Go with It. Tracy Bennett/Columbia Pictures-Sony/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Adam Sandler plays a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon in ""Just Go With It"" a fumbling comedy directed by Dennis Dugan that could have benefitted from surgical reconstruction. How about some liposuction to siphon off all those lame jokes?Very loosely based on the 1969 Walter Matthau comedy ""Cactus Flower"" ""Just Go With It"" has Sandler as Danny playing opposite Jennifer Aniston in what is largely though inadvertantly a chemistry-less exercise. Her Katherine Dannys loyal assistant is a divorced mom with two aggravatingly precocious kids (Bailee Madison and Griffin Gluck). She knows all of Dannys tricks and foibles of which there are many.Topping the list is his penchant for sporting a wedding ring despite not being married. This ploy he has discovered makes him a babe magnet. So does being a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon although the filmmakers tone down the mercenary voraciousness of his playmates. Danny is happy to be a roving roue until he meets the babe-a-licious Palmer played by SI swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker. (Her name sounds like a sandwich at a New York deli). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The 20-something Palmer is such a ding-a-ling darling that we are never once made to think shes also a gold digger. Still the question lingers What exactly does she see in Danny aside from his wallet? When she angrily discovers a wedding ring in his pocket after a night of beachside bliss he tries to cover his tracks by convincing Katherine to pretend to be his soon-to-be-divorced wife. He neednt have bothered. The way Palmer is portrayed she would have stayed with Danny even if he turned out to be the Hillside Strangler. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? When Danny and the entire entourage including an irritating hanger-on played by Nick Swardson decamp to Hawaii to cool out its inevitable he and Katherine will discover they are made for each other. Until that point we must endure subpar potty jokes a scene involving a sheep receiving the Heimlich maneuver lots of slo-mo shots of bikini clad beach gamboling a la ""10"" and other assorted time-stretchers.Throughout it all Sandler gamely attempts to be heartfelt and Aniston pushes the quirky-cutesy stuff. As an energy boost Nicole Kidman sashays onto the scene for an extended cameo as Devlin an old sorority sister and rival of Katherines. Kidman gives a screechingly over-the-top performance which is appropriate but also really annoying. In what is meant as the films comic highpoint Katherine and Devlin compete in a hula contest involving their respective partners and a pair of coconuts. It doesnt look like fun. Maybe they should have tried it with watermelons.

But a reliably disappointing subcategory that lacks any obvious rationale is the reimagining of good if perhaps not quite classic films associated with the latter 1960s and early 1970s. MORE ON ADAM SANDLER Hampton Stevens A Curmudgeonly Guide to Summer Movies 2010Christopher Orr Defending Apatows Flawed Underrated Funny PeopleHampton Stevens Ill Be Home for Hannukah The State of the Jewish Holiday SongPlanet of the Apes Alfie The Stepford Wives The Heartbreak Kid The Taking of Pelham 123--all were movies very much of their times and in their various ways they reflected the sexual and political anxieties of the era. Over the last decade all have been remade in forms utterly deracinated from their original context resulting in films that have no evident idea what they are trying to say or why they are trying to say it. To this unhappy fellowship may now be added Just Go With It a remake of the 1969 Gene Saks film Cactus Flower. The movie differs most appreciably from its recent forebears in two ways. First it had the decency to forego the title of the original film in favor of something more aggressively generic. And second Just Go With It--the title itself seems a plea for audiences forbearance--is so unremittingly awful that it makes nearly impossible any meaningful comparison to the original. Sakss film starred Walter Matthau as a dentist-cum-ladies-man who pretends to be married in order that none of his conquests will grow too attached. But when he falls in love with the much-younger Toni (Goldie Hawn who won an Oscar in this her first film role) he needs to find a make-believe wife to divorce. He quickly settles on his long-suffering spinsterish assistant Stephanie (Ingrid Bergman). The ensuing complications though farcical have a cruel authenticity to them the film was released after all at a time of all-but-declared intergenerational and inter-gender warfare and Cactus Flower for all its laughs is a frequently revealing dispatch from the battlefield. Such skirmishes having largely been settled however Just Go With It adopts the frame without the bigger picture. Adam Sandler plays Danny a rich plastic surgeon whose sexual shenanigans are rendered theoretically excusable thanks to a tragic backstory prologue As a young groom he overheard his bitchy bride-to-be regaling bridesmaids with tales of cuckolding him the day before the wedding. Drunk bereft and unwedded (though wedding-ringed) he stumbled into a bar and accidentally elicited the carnal compassion of a young beauty. Thus began two decades of his pretending to be unhappily married (to a wife who alternatingly cheats beats or drinks) in order to bed a succession of sympathetic twentysomethings. He is abetted in his deception by his devoted though not the least bit spinsterish assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston). Yet one day at a party his erotic and emotional balance are upset by the appearance of the intergalactically bodacious Palmer (Brooklyn Decker better known as the wife of tennis star Andy Roddick and best known as a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model with a proclivity for bikinis and body paint). The two sleep together on the beach and immediately fall in love in one of the laziest romantic epiphanies ever committed to the screen.From there the story unfolds as before--Katherine is enlisted as the fake wife from whom Danny is seeking a divorce--with a few added wrinkles the action is moved from New York City to Hawaii in order that the clothing worn by the female leads may be decreased exponentially (ah progress); a hyper-competitive old sorority sister (Nicole Kidman in one of the most foolish roles ever accepted by a former Best Actress) shows up to offer Katherine her own rationale for deception; and the peripheral child roles of the original are vastly expanded--Katherine a divorcee has two young kids--in order to transform an edgy sex comedy into a ""family film.""What is remarkable about this cavalcade of vulgarity--for which I might otherwise harbor a soft spot--is that at no time does it manage even accidentally to be bold or original or subversive. The structural alterations however pale in comparison to the tonal ones. Cactus Flower was not a ""serious"" movie but it was a grown-up one. Just Go With It by contrast offers an interminable (and for our purposes necessarily incomplete) litany of jokes about breast implants penile implants butt implants erectile dysfunction irritable bowel syndrome testicular injuries erections masturbation overweight women old women women with big noses men with big noses gay men lazy Hispanic nannies lazy Hawaiian nannies sex with sheep mouth-to-mouth resuscitation of sheep coconuts rubbed against breasts coconuts rubbed against crotches coconuts gripped between ass-cheeks hands accidentally placed upon boobs hands accidentally placed in toilets hands accidentally shit upon precocious children blackmailing adults precocious children mimicking cockney accents and precocious children dropped on their faces in the mud. There is even a scene unconnected to any other moment in the film in which an anonymous child hurls a soft drink on the belly of his very pregnant mother. Because you know its funny. In addition to such pearls we are of course treated to the wide array of random foreign and/or infantile accents that Sandler feels contractually obligated to perform. What is remarkable about this cavalcade of vulgarity--for which I might otherwise harbor a soft spot--is that at no time does it manage even accidentally to be bold or original or subversive. Indeed during the brief intervals between its experiments in PG-13 crudity the movie shifts without compunction or delay into cloyingly fraudulent melodrama. Rarely if ever have the saccharine and the scatological been so clumsily commingled. The performers slum their way through the material with as little enthusiasm as their paychecks will allow. Anistons old-maid casting is a joke--in the wrong way--a prolonged setup for the moment when she strips to reveal (surprise) her acutely aerobicized body in a bikini. (Ingrid Bergman was 54 when she took on the bittersweet role in one of her final film appearances; Aniston 41 is as hot as shes ever been in every sense.) As the youthful love interest Brooklyn Decker demonstrates that even eye candy can leave a sour taste despite a parade of skirts that just manage to cover her hips. In Cactus Flower director Saks made plentiful use of Hawns wide-as-outer-space baby blues; in Just Go With It director Dennis Dugan insistently focuses audience attention on orbs situated about eighteen inches lower. (Anistons line at one point ""She really wears that bikini well"" is the closest thing to a philosophic rationale the film ever offers for its existence.) That Decker will not follow in Hawns Oscar-winning footsteps is perhaps the safest bet of the cinematic year or decade. And what to make of Adam Sandler at this point? Less then two years ago in Judd Apatows underrated Funny People Sandler gave an indelible portrait of self-loathing as a talented comedian seduced by easy money into making childish films for which he felt only contempt. Since then he has appeared in Grown Ups and now Just Go With It. In Funny People it took a brush with terminal illness for him to rediscover his craft and his self-respect. One cant help but wonder what it might take in real life. At the moment I can think of no actor--not even you Mr. Cage--who makes his living by presuming the lowest common denominator to be quite so low. Just Go With It may be no Cactus Flower but its star comes off as a prick.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS Based loosely on the old movie ""Cactus Flower"" (itself based loosely on an old play) its the story of a swinging doctor who keeps commitment-crazy women at arms length by pretending to be married. Except then he meets the one girl he wants to wed. So he has to scare up a fake wife -- just so shell fake-divorce him in time for him to propose for real. Um right. Its a poor idea for a movie (the entire film would come to an end if just one person didnt act like an idiot) and it gets even worse when everything suddenly switches to a Hawaiian resort. (The new go-to cliche in comedies apparently motivated by nothing more than the stars desire to get a free vacation.) Will the doctor go for his hot new girlfriend? Will he suddenly see the old friend posing as his wife in a new light? Thats the supposed situation and it provides far too few jokes and far too many scenes of Adam Sandler trying to decide whether he should deign to marry the ludicrously bodacious Brooklyn Decker or the beautifully Bel Air-conditioned Jennifer Aniston. Yeah those lucky ladies. What a catch. The star is to his credit slightly less adolescent than usual and actually has a nice verbal rhythm with Aniston -- an old friend -- in their few dialogue-driven scenes. As for Decker who used to be a model she mostly acts with her cleavage -- something the film is only too eager to emphasize. But this is not enough to carry a movie. And its got a ton of dead weight in two not-very-amusing kids and the actively unfunny Nick Swardson as a woefully crude Sandler cousin. (Even odder is the sudden appearance of Nicole Kidman playing a screeching rival from Anistons past.) Sandler should know better. Hes at his best when he works with a real director; he had some genuinely surprising moments in ""Funny People."" But that movie went into a few dark places and wasnt a huge hit. And Sandler wants huge hits. Sandler wants huge paydays. And Sandler wants go-along guys who got their job by taking a quiz on the back of a matchbook.

((c)Columbia Pictures/courtesy Ever) ((c)Columbia Pictures/courtesy Ever) At 43 Nicole Kidman has never been funny before and she isnt funny playing an aging mean girl in ""Just Go With It"" yet she does manage to surprise us in two ways. One is the eagerness with which this subtle and accomplished actress humiliates herself in an attempt to generate some mass-market popularity which seems likely to elude her forever. The other is that she generates as many laughs in this cinematic cranial drill as alleged comedian Adam Sandler who delivers zero. Sandler (who often does bad movies) and Jennifer Aniston (who pretty much only does bad movies) are an LA plastic surgeon and his assistant whose laborious busted banter makes it clear from the beginning that were supposed to think theyre perfect for each other. Then nothing in particular keeps them hooking up for the rest of the movie except a single dramatic turn -- which occurs off screen. PHOTOS JENNIFER ANISTONS LEADING MEN ADAM SANDLERS LEADING LADIES Sandlers Danny is a sleazy lothario who discovers that though single he can attract women by wearing a wedding ring. Minutes after meeting a busty blonde (Brooklyn Decker) -- whose main purpose is to keep slinking toward the camera in slo-mo some parts of her arriving considerably earlier than the remainder -- Danny takes her on a moonlit stroll on the beach then sleeps with her right there. She discovers a wedding ring in his pocket -- whats this? Rather than tell the truth he invents a wife (whom Anistons Katherine winds up playing) he supposedly is about to divorce. Also he invents kids (she a divorcee has two). So naturally Palmer (the hot young thing) wants to meet Katherine. And um go on vacation to Hawaii with her Danny and the kids. The kids are supremely annoying (the tweener girl keeps doing a fake Cockney accent) though not as fungally irritating as Dannys sidekick cousin (Nick Swardson) who shows up uninvited to join the group for the trip playing her supposed new boyfriend ""Dolph Lundgren."" This means Swardson doing many lengthy ""riffs"" involving a German accent references to his working as a prostitute during which time he was forced to sell ""my schnitzel"" to the ladies and an apparent fondness for the ancient shtick of Arte Johnson who 40 years ago did a clueless comedy German on a variety show called ""Laugh-In."" Aniston who has a gift for playing every dismal role the same bland 8-pm-on-NBC way and Sandler do not exactly make you frantic to dive into a copy of US Weekly to find out if they were really doing it on the set. Sandler treats her like a particularly bored audience at the Giggle Hut on a humid Monday night in San Antonio. I havent even mentioned the boring plastic surgery gags (woman with grotesquely enlarged breast; woman with eyebrow halfway up her forehead) the many crotch-punches and face-plants the way Deckers acting suggests her only training in show business is to stand around at swimsuit shoots the way the movie thinks any reference to excrement is brilliant. Katherines code for doo-doo is ""Devlin"" named for the frenemy in college who hid little insults in her small talk. Naturally Devlin turns up at the same resort in Hawaii -- and shes Kidman. You know youre in trouble when youre suffering a comedy shutout and the pinch-hitters you send in are Kidman and Dave Matthews (as her dim hubby). In a scene of crass exploitation Kidman and Aniston do an endless hula dance-off in bikini top and grass skirts that culminates with the former holding a coconut between her chin and Matthews crotch -- and then against his butt. We later learn that gay guys are really good at picking up coconuts with their butt cheeks but only after were treated to a scene featuring a flamboyant lisping hairdresser whose hands flap on their wrists. Im not saying gay men should be offended by ""Just Go With It."" Im saying everyone should be offended by the time-annihilating suckage of this mirth void. Its as bad as showing up at the Super Bowl only to be told your tickets are no good. Its as bad as being ordered to work all weekend to cover for your boss while hes golfing in St. Barts. Its as bad ""Little Fockers."" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Survivor boss not sure if Hantz leaked spoilers Read Next Survivor boss not sure if Hantz leaked spoilers Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 34292 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 22910 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 17720 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 11 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 11 2011 1111AM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English An old-fashioned Hollywood factory worker Adam Sandler has churned out 30 movies since 1998. Some were so bad you wanted to leave the theatre halfway through even if you were watching on a plane. But you forgave him even the terrible ones - Little Nicky and Bedtime Stories - figuring a goof-off will occasionally goof up. Movies Just Go With It The official trailer Celebrity The Wattage Meter How bright are these stars shining? Sandler remains true to his regular-guy constituency by making fun of the movies he stars in - Im a movie star what a joke But he does more than that. Sandlers real shtick is satirizing being a grownup. Whether hes a juvenile delinquent playing golf ( Happy Gilmore) or an Israeli commando extinguishing fire with hummus ( You Dont Mess With the Zohan) Sandlers characters are usually 45 going on 14. Which brings us to his latest attempt at postponing adult responsibility Just Go with It. Sandler plays Danny Maccabee a selfish plastic surgeon with a sure-fire line for the ladies Please save me Im unhappily married. Yeah that always works. Women love whiny lost causes. Pretend to smoke and leave your clothes all around the house and youll have a harem. Well it works in Adam Sandler movies. Whenever Danny wanders into a bar he goes into his act On with the ring and sad sad face. ""My wife beats me."" ""Here put your hand on a true heart"" a 20-year-old woman says placing Sandlers hand on her breast. Life gets more complicated when Dr. Feelgood shows up at a party and who should stroll up to him (in jiggling slow-motion) but Brooklyn Decker the Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover girl. She plays a schoolteacher who falls in love with Sandler on the spot even though he forgets to put on his ring. They spend the night on the beach decorated in moonlight. In the morning she finds a wedding ring in his pants. Uh-oh our lying fraud is in trouble. What would a woman want him to do? Thats right he tells a bigger lie. Danny asks his medical assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his wife. That way he can divorce her and marry the sexy cover girl. You know what happens but the safely familiar is what makes Adam Sandler movies such an easy chore. Just Go with It is exactly that - sort of. Sandler and Aniston have fun at the office with Dr. Dannys patients especially a woman with too much face work who cant retrieve a cocked eyebrow. Danny and Katherine have a good laugh and their fun is infectious. Sandler and Aniston easily pass the only important test of romantic comedies We like them and want them to like each other. If only the other cast members were as good. Nicole Kidman gets away with a small part as Anistons scheming college nemesis. But Deckers best moments are all in slow motion and the scant comic support comes from Sandler regular Nick Swardon playing a Prussian nitwit. Despite the spotty supporting cast and absurd plot Just Go with It will likely prove irresistible to Sandler loyalists especially after a recent Super Bowl promo featuring the cast in Hawaii - a sight for cold eyes in February. Speaking of which the Super Bowl MVP is awarded a trip to Disneyland. Maybe in the future he should be awarded a part in an Adam Sandler movie. There is no bigger male fantasy land.

I know that a taut finely wrought C.H.U.D. would go a long way toward brightening my day.The new Adam Sandler romantic comedy Just Go With It makes clear thats not what has happened here. Just Go With It a reworking of the beloved 1969 Cactus Flower starring Walter Matthau Goldie Hawn and Ingrid Bergman is an inoffensive family-friendly offering thats warm but also devoid of any of the sparkle and sophistication that marked the original.Sandler plays Danny a schlub who has his heart broken on the day of his wedding. Thereafter he merely plays at being married using his now-useless ring as a prop in the tale of matrimonial abuse and betrayal he spins to seduce women.Things go wrong however when the now-successful plastic surgeon meets Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) a 23-year-old beauty. When she discovers his pocketed ring Danny spins his usual line but runs into a snag Palmer wants to meet his terrible soon-to-be ex-wife.Danny makes Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) his loyal office manager and nurse play the pill-popping harpy from whom hes running. Unfortunately Katherine (in reality a single mom) lets slip that she has children and now Palmer wants to meet them.As a schoolteacher Palmers very much into ensuring that the transition from ex-wife to girlfriend be as smooth as possible for little Maggie (Bailee Madison) and Mike (Griffin Gluck). So the six of them -- Dannys idiot pal Eddie (Nick Swardson) tags along as Katherines highly improbable German boyfriend -- decide to take a Hawaiian vacation together. High jinks ensue as Dannys carefully orchestrated empire of lies crumbles and real feelings are revealed.Unfortunately things dont add up. Dannys duplicity runs so deep that at some point in the movie he begins to appear psychotic. As if to counteract this Sandler plays the everyman card with such abandon that its hard to believe anyone feels anything more than mild affection for his character.Unlike many models turned actors Decker doesnt disgrace herself but Palmers youthful dizziness doesnt explain how she could fail to notice that the designer-clad trollop she first met is ever afterward a warm and caring mom.There are chuckles -- the two kids are natural-born grifters and Aniston continues to show signs of being a great comic actress -- and Just Go With It has an underlying sweetness. Regrettably the lazy pacing and predictable script make it hard to care very much. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Nicole Kidman has a giddy extended cameo.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted February 11 2011A perfect storm (although perfect is definitely the wrong word) of potty jokes sex jokes breast-implant jokes bratty-kid jokes and sheep-CPR jokes Just Go With It stars Adam Sandler as a Beverly Hills lothario who pretends to be married - unhappily - thereby winning the sympathy and physical consolation of attractive women he meets in bars.But theres more to it than that. To wit Nicole Kidman who bursts on the scene giddily camping it up in an extended cameo. To wit that resuscitated sheep. And to wit Hawaii where the third act of this fairly witless rom-com farce takes place.One big fat lie leads to another Walter Matthau and Goldie Hawns Cactus Flower gets thrown into the mix Dolph Lundgrens name is batted around like a shuttlecock and Jennifer Aniston finds another opportunity to show off her buffed and burnished bod.Directed by Dennis Dugan who can be credited with (or blamed for) a slew of similarly sophomoric Sandler vehicles the forgettably titled Just Go With It works off a flimsy screwball premise Sandlers Danny Maccabee meets the blond beautiful Palmer (Brooklyn Decker) and thinks hes found The One - and he hasnt scammed her with the usual line about an abusive pill-popping wife. Palmer feels a connection too but then she finds a wedding band in Dannys pocket and thinks shes been had.In order to convince her otherwise Danny a successful plastic surgeon recruits his longtime assistant - that would be Aniston - to act as his wife or about-to-be-ex. When Palmer meets the outgoing Mrs. Maccabee and sees that Danny was being honest with her (ha) all will be right with the world.Toss in a pair of precocious Hollywood kids (Bailee Madison and Griffin Gluck as Anistons single-mom munchkins) and add a bunch of complications and contrivances and theres enough going on to keep the seats filled for a couple of hours.Sandler shambling and smirky delivers another of those one-take performances of his - likable and lazy forever on the verge of cracking himself up. Aniston taking her cues from her costar doesnt expend much energy either but there are glimmers of comic brio. Now and then she makes a face that suggests she might actually be having some fun.Just Go With It  (out of four stars)Directed by Dennis Dugan.

Photo Tracy Bennett AP Just Go With It review Sweet earthy love story 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Just Go With It Comedy. Starring Jennifer Aniston Adam Sandler Brooklyn Decker and Nicole Kidman. Directed by Dennis Dugan. (PG-13. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It had been one of the minor inducements to longevity this crazy hope of one day actually seeing Jennifer Aniston in a good movie. That day arrives with ""Just Go With It"" a very funny romantic comedy that nicely combines Adam Sandlers acerbic sweetness with Anistons down-to-earth warmth - and that finds an excuse for Aniston to both play an average person and yet dress like a movie star. The screenplay has a setup that borders on farce but the romantic heart of it is strong and expresses something unusual. Its a movie about the romance of familiarity about the satisfaction and spiritual necessity of actually knowing someone and being known. So much of movie romance is usually about the opposite of that about going off into the unknown about adventure in the form of not physical danger but emotional danger. ""Just Go With It"" makes a feint in that direction but not enough to fool anybody. The fun begins with a lie. Sandler plays a plastic surgeon who is crazy about a young woman he meets at a party (Brooklyn Decker) and finds himself lying to her about his marital status. Hes a bachelor but for some dumb reason (not worth going into) he tells her that hes in the process of getting a divorce. Suddenly needing a woman to pretend to be his soon-to-be ex-wife he turns to his assistant (Aniston) and from there the lies snowball into fake kids and a fake new boyfriend for the fake ex-wife. Related Stories Just Go With It Sandler has come into his own in middle age - he has gone from comic to straight man and reacting to other peoples antics and idiocies suits him. Aniston remains a remarkably natural actress Watching her in the early scenes in the office with Sandler youd almost think there wasnt a script. Her technique is seamless; her focus on the other actor complete. Its like a quality of unusual humility that translates into talent. Later dressed as a rich mans wife and pretending to be a castrating spouse shes inspired. Decker known for posing in Sports Illustrated spends a lot of time in a bikini enough so that the visual begins to lose all impact which is probably the movies intention. To her credit Decker lends the character a certain kindheartedness that feels genuine. Still the hands-down find of ""Just Go With It"" is 11-year-old Bailee Madison as Anistons daughter who is bubbling with energy wit and invention a 40-year-old trapped in a childs body. Nicole Kidman appears in a featured role as a nightmare of pretension who resurfaces in Anistons life. The bits keep coming A scene in which a man must revive a sick sheep is especially funny for the sheeps clearly made of rubber. But all the jokes as well as the beauty of the location - Hawaii - cant distract from the movies main spectacle which concerns one enviable guys having to choose between two beautiful woman. If youre a man part of the experience of ""Just Go With It"" will inevitably consist of making that choice for him in your own head. Female viewers will only have Sandler which under the circumstances seems less than fair. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations and partial nudity.

EnlargeClose By Tracy Bennett Columbia Pictures Relationship ruse Jennifer Aniston pretends to be the ex-wife of her boss (Adam Sandler) to help him woo another woman. Witness Just Go With It a surprisingly breezy and enjoyable comedy from Dennis Dugan a Sandler pal who has peddled such gruel as The Benchwarmers and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. Here though Sandler and co-star Jennifer Aniston seem free to clown and their chemistry seems as genuine as any A-list mingling in years -- save for Brad and Angelina of course. Yes the plot hangs by a thread and the entire movie comes undone if one person acts like an adult. But that may be too much for the man who brought life to The Waterboy. PHOTOS Lots of Jennifer Aniston snaps And the rapport he and Aniston share seems genuine. Sandler plays Danny a plastic surgeon and schlub who marries a shrew but discovers post-divorce (and post-nose job) that the gold band is a magnet for bar chicks. That changes when he meets Palmer (the stunning Brooklyn Decker) which prompts him to shove the ring in his pocket to woo her beachside. Everythings hunky-dory until Palmer discovers the ring in Dannys pocket and naturally assumes hes married. Just Go With It   1/2 (out of four) Stars Adam Sandler Jennifer Aniston Brooklyn Decker Director Dennis Dugan Distributor Columbia Pictures Rating PG-13 for frequent crude and sexual content partial nudity brief drug references and language Running time 1 hour 50 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Heres where the film takes its first characteristic step Instead of explaining himself Danny concocts a bizarre lie that hes separated from his wife and close to a divorce. To maintain that lie he persuades his assistant Katherine (Aniston) to not only play his soon-to-be-ex-wife but to come with her two children to Hawaii to well make the movie feature length. For added heehaws the normally dependable Nick Swardson comes along to act the ass and delve into some of Sandlers more nuanced scatological humor. It would be easy enough to chuck this on the pile of disposable Sandler films of which there are many. But he plays just enough of the antisocial geek -- like he did so well in Punch Drunk Love-- and his give-and-take with Aniston is so sweet that the scenes work. Ultimately its a mainstream romantic comedy so youll know the characters next moves a half-hour before they do. And theres not a loose end that isnt as neatly tied as a Christmas bow. But sometimes theres nothing wrong with just going with a sweet-natured date flick. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 10 2011 649 PM Just Go With It The American romantic comedy is in deep trouble. By Dana Stevens Just Go With It You know how weve all been cutting romantic comedies a break these past few years? It isnt just me. Theres been a tendency among critics to grade this genre on a curve. We afford extra credit to those rare rom-coms that arent completely vulgar and hateful for whatever baby steps they take toward funniness or sexiness or vague resemblance to the actual process of human courtship. I think theres a reason were doing this an unspoken agreement among those who love this venerable genre that the American romantic comedy is in deep trouble and that we need to band together to protect those precious green shoots that remain. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. An excellent example of the kind of movie were trying to protect the green shoots from is Just Go With It (Sony Pictures) a comedy so noxious it seems the product of deliberate malignity. Surely the sour vapid miserable world of this movie cant reflect any real human beings notion of what love or humor or good storytelling is--not even a Hollywood screenwriters. The only acceptable explanation for the existence of Just Go With It is that everyone involved in the creation of this movie--the director Dennis Dugan the co-writers Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling the entire misused and humiliated cast--hates romantic comedy and wants it to die. Advertisement Deliberately extinguishing the genre thats kept them working would seem an odd career move for Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston but maybe--like Sandlers character in Judd Apatows Funny People--theyre burned out on the life task of making people laugh. Sandlers performance in Funny People blew me out of the water--his character a needy and volatile movie star was the best thing in that flawed but fascinating movie. But Sandler is back to his usual dramatically inert self as Danny a wealthy plastic surgeon who pretends to be married as a way to pick up younger women. (He complains about his wifes mistreatment of him scores a night of pity sex then has the perfect excuse never to call again.) ""Youre a pig"" Danny is told in no uncertain terms by his assistant Katherine (Aniston) a down-to-earth divorced mother of two. Yet inexplicably Katherine agrees to lend her boss a hand when he finally falls for one of his conquests the blonde lithe and endlessly amiable Palmer (Brooklyn Decker). Danny wants to take it to the next level with Palmer--i.e. not discard her after a single one-night stand--but she will only agree to date him if she can meet his wife in person to confirm their supposedly impending divorce. You see where this is going. Katherine throws herself into the role of impersonating Dannys wife the web of deception widens and farcical complications ensue. (In fact Just Go With It is based on a French stage farce that was adapted as the 1969 film Cactus Flower.) Somehow all three members of the triangle--along with Katherines two kids and Dannys cretinous cousin (Nick Swardson)--end up vacationing together at a Hawaiian resort with everyone except Palmer adopting elaborate fake personas and in two particularly painful cases accents. Another wrinkle is added when Katherines college nemesis the hypercompetitive Devlin (Nicole Kidman) turns out to be vacationing at the same resort with her millionaire dud of a husband (Dave Matthews). Yes the setup is absurd but the flimsiness of its premise doesnt even make the Top 10 list of Just Go With Its problems. The true source of this movies evil lies in what I can only at the risk of sounding priggish call its value system. Simply put all of these people are horrible to each other and only about 10 percent of that horribleness is ever acknowledged. Every relationship in the film is crassly transactional When Danny takes Katherine shopping to outfit her for a single appearance as his wife she exploits the opportunity to the hilt loading him down with bags containing tens of thousands of dollars worth of purchases. Later one of her children blackmails Danny into buying them all tickets to Hawaii; he complies resentfully. None of this angling for expensive presents is presented as greedy or materialistic in the least; its just the way people with less money get what they want from people with more. Danny for his part takes advantage of his position as sugar daddy to insult and abuse his whole entourage of traveling companions. Hes so consistently awful that when he briefly manages to treat the children with mildly avuncular jollity his harem (which is how I came to think of the Aniston/Decker dyad) coos over him as if hes just cured polio. Which brings us to the movies treatment of women Hoo boy. Where to begin? Major plot points hinge on the understanding that Jennifer Aniston is a frumpy old hag who can only earn the longed-for prize of being leered at by creeps when she doffs her clothes to reveal an unexpectedly slammin bikini body. (The fact that said leering happens in the company of the Aniston characters son adds an extra-unsavory twist.) In not one but two scenes one scantily clad woman is explicitly and lengthily compared to another by an audience consisting mainly of men. The second of those scenes--in which Aniston competes in a hula contest with Kidman--also makes a point of casually insulting old or fat women who are peremptorily booted off the stage for insufficient hotness. As for the movies treatment of race suffice it to say that in those rare moments when Hawaiian and other nonwhite characters appear theyre generally depicted as obese buffoons. This is one of those movies in which no subplot or character provides respite from any other; every time the camera cuts away from one scene you know another equally unpleasant one is coming. As the oversexed fake-German-accented cousin Eddie Swardson strains for broad hilarity in every scene with a rate of success analogous to that of Donald Rumsfelds memos. Decker is asked only to remain cheerfully oblivious and near-naked as indignities are visited upon her character. Aniston deploys her trademark cocker-spaniel mannerisms--which in the right context can still be endearing--into the void created by Sandlers charisma-less presence. And the children are best left unmentioned for all our sakes. Only Nicole Kidman surprises in a small role that allows her to make fun of her ice-princess public persona--theres even a plastic-surgery joke at her expense. Kidman must have enjoyed the idea of slumming in a movie so far beneath her pay grade. Too bad the film she chose is unworthy not just of an Oscar-winning actress but of every member of its cast--and its audience. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

Adam Sandlers Happy Madison production team has rarely put much stock in the rules of classical storytelling but its newest project ""Just Go With It"" manages to misfire in two seemingly incompatible directions. A puerile kiddie-comedy without the anarchic energy and a schmaltzy romantic comedy without the sweetness this Hawaii-set farce is too frantic and too lackadaisical a take on the oft-adapted French play ""Cactus Flower."" Working with longtime director Dennis Dugan Sandler and the rest of the films marquee cast could nonetheless steer it toward good returns. From the outset we seem to be firmly in vintage Sandler territory. An 80s-set prologue shows Sandlers Danny (affixed with a mammoth fake schnoz) as he gets his heart broken on his wedding day. Drowning his sorrows in the bar afterward he finds that his wedding ring -- and subsequent tall tales about his awful abusive spouse -- functions as a fail-safe casual-sex magnet. Flash forward to the present day and Dannys a wealthy Beverly Hills plastic surgeon still single and still pulling the same sad-sack husband trick on nubile UCLA coeds. Wacky shots of plastic-surgery disasters constitute almost all the jokes in the opening 10 minutes but then again this is a film that doesnt know when to quit Halfway-funny early gags on an unusual euphemism for defecation and an unseen characters soul patch are reprised nearly a dozen times throughout the pic. Danny abstains from pulling the fake-wife trick when he meets schoolteacher Palmer (swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker seen quite frequently in a swimsuit) though she happens upon his prop ring after a tryst. Immediately segueing from satyr to lovestruck aspiring family man having apparently fallen head-over-heels with Palmer off-camera Danny claims hes getting a divorce and recruits his single-mom office assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) to stand in as his soon-to-be ex-wife. Of course this deception bequeaths an endless series of increasingly insane follow-up fibs -- Palmer also has to meet Dannys ""kids"" (Griffin Gluck and Bailee Madison the latter affecting a faux-Cockney accent) and Katherines new ""lover"" (Nick Swardson affecting a faux-Eurohash accent) -- although the web of lies makes about as much sense as the real story. For reasons too laborious to follow the whole clan sets off on a Hawaiian vacation where Katherine runs into her sorority-sister nemesis (Nicole Kidman) and invents a whole new set of fictions to impress her. When a film swings as wildly and frequently as this one its bound to hit a few lucky shots and a scene in which Swardson wrestles with an obviously fake comatose sheep is just surreal enough to connect. More often than not the pic just goes for the easy layup In the course of one three-minute period we see Sandler nailed in the crotch Madison hurled into the mud and Swardson attacked by a wild boar with none of these pratfalls even gesturing at a proper setup. Thesping is all good enough for this material though Deckers purely reactive character seems to have been a tough one for a first-time film actress to play. But the best actor here Kidman gets a rather uncomfortable run through the ringer shot entirely in the most unflattering clothes and light. (She and Aniston seem to be inhabiting different continents in their conversation scenes.) Kidman is also given a closeted gay husband (rock star Dave Matthews) and required to ask Danny for a plastic surgery recommendation; the filmmakers cant have been unaware of her gossip-column history and this all feels more like cruelty to the actress than knowing inside-humor. Hawaiis reliably beautiful locations (and outlandish luxury resorts) are well lensed and other tech work is adequate.

TWITTER The predicable overlong romantic farce has enough sass and sex appeal to appease fans of stars Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston -- plus an ace in the form of model-turned-actress Brooklyn Decker. As thoroughly generic as its title Just Go With It aims at two different constituencies Adam Sandlers rude-guy-humor fans and Jennifer Aniston rom-com loyalists and just partially hits both targets. Labored repetitive and lacking a single moment of surprise in the course of its indulgent two hours this Sony release nonetheless has one ace to play in the beauteous form of Brooklyn Decker the slo-mo sight of whom striding out of the sea in a bikini during Super Bowl commercials last weekend no doubt guaranteed that guys wont object too strenuously to this as a Valentines Day weekend date-night choice. Overall commercial outlook is very good. Related article Brooklyn Deckers model-to-actress career challenge It wont mean anything to 99.9 percent of its paying customers but this mildly racy pictorially sunny PG-13 farce represents a very free reworking of the 1969 hit Cactus Flower (and its Broadway and Paris stage predecessors) with Sandler Aniston and Decker in the Walter Matthau Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn roles respectively. The age bracket for the older two characters has been lowered by a decade or more and little of the original remains in Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowlings adaptation other than the medical professions of the leads and some plot machinations leading to an ending thats preordained in the first few minutes. With the world-weariness of Funny People out of his system Sandler treads familiar ground here as Dr. Daniel Maccabee a glib Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who for more than 20 years has racked up considerable romantic mileage from the trick of wearing a wedding ring and pretending to be unhappily married. He has no trouble nailing the hottest young thing at a beach party math teacher Palmer (Decker) though contrived complications lead to his subsequently lying to her that hes not only married but has two children. The only person Danny cant put anything over on is his assistant Katherine (Aniston) a good-natured no-nonsense divorcee who actually does have two kids. Very minor efforts -- lab coat drab hairstyle -- have been made in the early doctors office scenes to make Aniston look plainer than she is but these cant disguise the fact that Katherine is the woman for Danny; hes just too dazzled by his latest conquest to notice. A couple of parties and medical scenes provide director Dennis Dugan (in his sixth collaboration with Sandler) the opportunities for easy yuks at the expense of patients who need some plastic surgery and those who have had too much. In the former category are a woman with one eyebrow considerably higher up her forehead than the other and a large lady with notably mismatched breasts because of an implant collapse. Notable among the latter is the very funny Kevin Nealon as an aging swinger with a face so frozen he cant close his mouth to swallow a drink. Understanding her boss dilemma as no one else can Katherine gamely agrees to pose as Dannys about-to-be ex-wife when Palmer insists upon verifying the truth of his tall tale. The kids (Bailee Madison Griffin Gluck) get dragged into the act in the bargain whereupon the whole group along with Dannys best friend Eddie (Nick Swardson) fly off to Hawaii where the bedroom farce plays itself out -- to diminishing returns -- within the confines of a luxury resort. The breeziness of the dialogue exchanges possess an agreeable casualness; the no-b.s. banter between Danny and Katherine makes them a convincingly good fit and the variously motivated use of linguistic accents by Eddie (manic German) and Katherines young daughter (cultivated British) lightly enlivens matters. But most of the time you wonder how Palmer could be so good-natured that shes not only willing to put up with the confounding shenanigans of her new acquaintances but actually keen to marry the central perpetrator of them. Like Will Smith Sandler appears to want to win approval by showing what a great guy his characters are; crude jokes to the side he presents Danny as being motivated only by true love as being great with kids and doing the right thing however goofily. To his credit however he cuts a wide berth for his co-stars; in her big-screen debut Decker gets plenty of time to prove her ease and natural allure in front of the camera though Swardson the kids and Nicole Kidman -- in a surprising over-the-top comic turn as a long-lost school friend Katherine encounters in Hawaii but would have preferred to remain lost -- are considerably overexposed. The beneficiary of the general excess is Aniston who comes off as more energetic alert and alive than she normally does in her generally formulaic movies. Whether its the joshing mode of much of her dialogue or just a happenstance of collaborating with these particular people she seems to be having fun and this raises her scenes a notch above the rest. The extent of product placement in Just Go With It makes you want to escape to a deserted island -- or even just to the desert -- to recover from the commercial bombardment. The soundtracks barrage of familiar pop tunes especially from the Police is similarly overdone. Release date Friday Feb. 11 (Sony) Production Columbia Pictures Happy Madison Prods.

Jennifer Aniston Runs Away with It What could have been another crude Adam Sandler comedy is redeemed by the former Friends best work in years By Mary Pols MaryPolsFeb. 10 2011 Share Read Later Tracy Bennett / Columbia Pictures IndustriesNick Swardson Jennifer Aniston Bailee Madison Griffin Gluck Brooklyn Decker and Adam Sandler from left in the Columbia Pictures comedy Just Go with It Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Jennifer Aniston has appeared opposite all sorts of leading men in recent years including a dashing foreigner (Clive Owen) a steaming pile of machismo (Gerard Butler) and a handsome cerebral type (Aaron Eckhart). None of those pairings quite worked and its been depressing to see the spunky appealing Aniston who is a gifted comedian flounder in movie after movie. In Just Go with It a loose but fairly snappy remake of the 1969 charmer Cactus Flower shes teamed with the perennially immature decidedly nonchiseled Adam Sandler and does her best work in years -- while making Sandlers classically crass character seem almost bearable. Sandler plays Danny a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. Danny is a pig in his prime a man who has lied to women for some 20 years always pretending to be married but tragically so the wife cheats on him beats him never gave up ""hooking."" The lies are elaborate and improbable but women those gentle innocents never seem to catch on. Were in on the motivation for this Danny overheard his bride on what was to be his wedding day admitting she was marrying him only because he was going to be a doctor. After accidentally discovering the magical girl-attracting properties of the ring he never again took it off. Now as he tells us its his ""precious."" The delivery is supposed to be Gollums but its really pure Sandler --sloppy silly humor. Maybe Sandler really cant help himself; when he sees an opportunity for an eighth-grade joke he goes for it. The effect is jarring when were being asked to enter a fantasy in which a gorgeous 23-year-old sixth-grade teacher named Palmer (Brooklyn Decker a swimsuit model 21 years Sandlers junior) falls madly in love with Danny. Like Goldie Hawn in Cactus Flower Palmer is a kind and decent girl (although Decker is not one-tenth the cinematic enchantress the Oscar-winning Hawn was). Goldie was fine with being a mistress but the ring is a turnoff to Palmer. She wont dally with a married man. Trapped in his lie Danny promises her hes getting divorced and just as Walter Matthau did with Ingrid Bergman in the 1969 version must find someone to play his fake soon-to-be ex-wife -- whom he would like for reasons of pride to be ""hot."" Enter Aniston playing Dannys practical supposed-to-be-mousy office assistant Katherine (oh to be a mouse like that). Shes a single mom with two children Maggie (Bailee Madison) and Michael (Griffin Gluck) and after 10 years of working for Danny shes fond enough of him that when he asks her to be his accomplice she agrees. Since Katherine dresses in what Danny terms ""the best Old Navy has to offer"" she needs a makeover. Let the shopping montage commence Its touching that director Dennis Dugan and writers Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling thought to include this scene for the women in the audience. Any of us who winced at the term ""fun bags"" or groaned at the way Danny speaks only to Palmers cleavage would presumably take comfort in those precious moments watching Katherine try on shoes. Assuming a sexy imperious identity as Devlin -- the name of her high school nemesis -- Katherine has some fun with the masquerade. So do her children who get roped into playing Danny and ""Devlin""s children. These kids particularly the precocious Maggie who likes to slip into an arch Cockney accent really ought to be annoying (they are such movie brats) but the young actors playing them are so deft and committed to what theyre doing that they broke down my resistance. In a broader sense thats what the movie did as well. The charade presents many opportunities for laughs some involving broad physical comedy -- quite a bit of which is centered around the Los Angeles obsession with plastic surgery -- and others using actual wit with words. Id never call Just Go with It sophisticated but its got a good-natured vibe. Even Nicole Kidman in a smallish part in which shes paired with rock star Dave Matthews seems to be relaxed and having a fun time. The bottom line is Aniston and Sandler have a genuine spark both in their verbal volleys and in the warmth with which Danny and Katherine regard each other. They make such good foils for each other that the sophomoric elements endemic to Sandlers work -- guys getting socked in the crotch and such -- fade into the background a bit. By the time the whole crew travels to Hawaii for a ""family"" trip accompanied by Dannys gross cousin Eddie (the amusing Nick Swardson) posing as Devlins lover I start to believe it possible that Katherine might be good for Danny and vice versa. Maybe even as good as Aniston is for Sandler and he for her. Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009.

"Movie review Just Go With It - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ScreenMovie review Just Go With ItJennifer Aniston in her familiar pretty practical and likable role shines in Just Go With It. Adam Sandler also stars.February 11 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Brooklyn Decker left and Adam Sandler star in ""Just Go With It""... (Tracy Bennett / Associated...)The best thing about the new Adam Sandler comedy ""Just Go With It"" (Im assuming ""Just Bear With Me"" was already taken) is Rachel. And by that I mean Jennifer Aniston playing a slight variation of the pretty pragmatic waitress with great hair and even better comic timing whom America (or large parts of it) fell in love with over the 10-year run of ""Friends."" In ""Just Go With It"" whose title really has to be read as a plea from the filmmakers given all the leaps of faith they want you to take with a movie thats really more like a loose improv session or an extended party game a oh wait what was I sayinga| Aniston plays Katherine a single mom working as an assistant to Sandlers successful plastic surgeon and shes got the frumpy wardrobe to prove it. If youre inclined to buy the premise the way for a nerdy guy to bed an endless succession of great-looking chicks is to pretend hes married. I gather its all part of the feminine mystique as defined by boobs (as in boys not breasts) that a wedding ring and a bad marriage are the ultimate aphrodisiac. Right. Anyway Dr. Danny has finally met a gorgeous girl (Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover girl Brooklyn Decker) who likes him even without the wedding ring. Since he really likes this girl back when she discovers his fake gold band and declares she wont date a married man he undertakes a cover-up of Watergate proportions to try to keep her. The plan involves getting Katherine to pose as his wife conscripting her kids concocting a divorce funding a ""Pretty Woman"" makeover and before you can say ""Huh?"" the new girlfriend the fake ex the fake kids and the fake exs fake flame (Nick Swardson) are off to Hawaii to swim with dolphins. Dont ask. The whole idea somehow seemed more plausible in 1969 when the screen version of ""Cactus Flower"" was first trotted out winning Goldie Hawn an Oscar for her turn as the girlfriend. It was based on the Tony-winning stage play which itself was based on the French stage play which makes sense. After all if anyone knows what to do with a sexy farce its the French. Still the movie is a good fit for Aniston. One of her gifts which director Dennis Dugan a long-time Sandler collaborator exploits in a good way is her ability to look as believable in a shapeless off-the-rack shift and sandals as in a body-hugging off-the-shoulder mini and stilettos. But a and this is the big one that most of Hollywood doesnt get since they keep casting her in one failed romantic comedy after another a he also understands that while shes hot shes not smokin hot as in mouth-drooling pulse-racing temperature-raising hot. Her on-screen kisses and clinches are more sisterly and sincere than sexy. Maybe shes a slow burner but at least on screen no one has figured out yet how to light that fire. All of those girl-next-door punch-you-in-the-arm-if-she-likes-you qualities make a good comic match for Sandler though whos got the whole not-sexy thing going too. His nerdy naughty-but-nice persona has proved appealing to males and females alike and coupled with his mumble-funny self-deprecating patter it has made him a box-office billionaire (3 billion and counting) which means Hollywood will let him do whatever he wants. And that is what happens here. Theres not much to say about Dugans directing; even he admits in the production notes that his main job is to let Sandler be Sandler. Ditto writers Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling. Their screenplay may be based on ""Cactus Flower"" but its been pureed almost beyond recognition in the Sandler blender. Theres a wacky mean-girl turn by Nicole Kidman who plays Devlin Katherines old college nemesis. Complications abound when they bump into each other in Hawaii and not just in that old-scores-to-settle way. Devlin is what Katherine has adopted as her fake wife name and its also what her kids and Dr. Danny call poop. So along with all the other potty-mouth stuff there is a lot of Devlin name-dropping going on. Ha ha ha. The kids Bailee Madison (""Bridge to Terabithia"") and Griffin Gluck have some cute bits as the precocious sort who squeeze a lot out of Dr. Danny in return for calling him Dad. Decker definitely has what it takes to look really good in an itsy-bitsy teenie-weenie a| or at least I think thats what the filmmakers meant when they raved about her ""natural talent."" Swardson has his moments masquerading as the fake boyfriend essentially providing the outrageous to counterbalance the generally low-key comedy elsewhere though there is a sheep punch line that gets punched a few times too many. If youre a Sandler film buff the comedy is classic Sandler and will probably satisfy. Still the best thing about the movie remains Aniston a she is reason enough to just go with it. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMOVIE REVIEWS  Mission Improbable  Ron Howards Apollo 13 Dramatizes Troubled 1970 Space FlightJune 30 1995MOVIE REVIEW  The Subtle Pleasures of The Rachel PapersSeptember 6 1989Movie Reviews  Waking Up to a Confused State in DreamMarch 3 1989MOVIE REVIEW  Drive Takes License With Its ResponsibilityJuly 6 1988MORE STORIES ABOUTScreenCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-just-go-with-it-20110211,0,700256.story",200,justgowithit22,justgowithit,latimes
"Just Go With It Just forget it | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesJust Go With It Just forget itAdam Sandlers new comedy Just Go With It is so lazily constructed it risks offending the indolent.Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler in Just Go With It.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 10 2011 Just Go With It (out of 4) Starring Adam Sandler Jennifer Aniston Nicole Kidman and Brooklyn Decker. Directed by Dennis Dugan. 116 minutes. At major theatres. PG Remember the last really funny Adam Sandler comedy? Im struggling to recall it -- The Wedding Singer anyone? --- and its abundantly clear that Sandler is caught in his own memory gap. As he wrestles with an uncomfortable middle age hes either forgotten or ceased to care about how to make people laugh. Take Just Go With It (please) the latest noxious emission from his Happy Madison gas factory. Its a movie so lazily constructed it risks offending the indolent. Its very loosely based on Cactus Flower the 1969 film that won Goldie Hawn the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. The original teaming Hawn with Walter Matthau and Ingrid Bergman was an example of how good acting and directing can enliven dumb farce. The remake yoking Sandler with Jennifer Aniston and Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker with an implausibly game Nicole Kidman in tow demonstrates the exact opposite. Just Go With It has abundant flaws not least of them being the direction by Dennis Dugan the obedient Sandler serf who also helmed last summers equally woeful Grown Ups. But the excruciating and toilet-obsessed writing by Allan Loeb (The Dilemma The Switch) and Timothy Dowling (Role Models) is the most glaring reason why Just Go With It seems more like a death-march command than an enticement to frivolity. The screenplay cant even stay true to its own internal idiocy. Sandlers Danny Maccabee is an L.A. plastic surgeon who wounded by past infidelity (seen in a 1988 prologue) now wears a fake wedding ring to deter potential brides. He finds that women are drawn like catnip to his ring along with his bogus tales of marital distress and he gets more sack action than hed ever imagined. Danny uses deception to get over deception and then some. The magic circle becomes a problem for Danny after one night with his latest score a dim-bulb hottie named Palmer (Decker who was not hired for her acting ability). She demands to meet the soon-to-be ex-wife the latest permutation of Dannys pack o lies. Flailing for a dodge Danny reaches out to his assistant Katherine (Aniston) whom were supposed to believe is mousy because she wears glasses and a lab coat. He bribes her into pretending shes the exiting Mrs. Maccabee. An abundance of contrivances ensue involving Katherines obnoxious children Maggie and Michael (Bailee Madison and Griffin Gluck) and Dannys moronic cousin Eddie (Nick Swardson). As this nearly two-hour movie wheezes towards the halfway mark en route to its obvious conclusion everyone decamps to Hawaii where plausibility is further abused and any pretense of humor is abandoned. Eddie adopts a German accent and dons Coke-bottle glasses pretending to be Katherines German boyfriend. Its still early in 2011 but hes a strong candidate for the years most irksome and unnecessary rom-com sidekick. Meanwhile Kidman enters the picture as the chirpy Devlin former college rival to Katherine whose personality was so irritating Katherine taught her children to use ""Devlin"" as synonym for poo. Devlin is married to the effete snob Ian inexplicably played by rocker Dave Matthews. All of this is calculated to maintain the ruse to the clueless Palmer that Dr. Danny is the eligible bachelor of her dreams despite a 20-year age gap his propensity for lying (he even faked his way through med school) his cheapness and his general irritability. Wading through this puerile mess is exhausting for the viewer but it seems to have tuckered Sandler out even before he punched his time card for yet another factory gig. Its painfully clear he knows this is weak stuff yet he cant seem to rouse himself to do anything about it. He sabotages the potentially good chemistry with Aniston by relentlessly mugging at every turn. Is Sandler now choosing films strictly on the basis of how pleasant the weather and locales are? Kidman and Aniston seem slightly more engaged but their efforts are undone by Dugans artless direction. A set piece where both women compete as hula dancers might have been funny in better circumstances but it falls as flat as the rest of the picture. If theres any justice Just Go With It will be greeted to the sound of no hands clapping in empty auditoriums. Do pass Go; do not destroy any more brain cells.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The new Adam Sandler movie is called ""Just Go With It and before its recommended that you just go in the opposite direction (and you probably should) its worth considering a few items of interest. The movie is based on the 1969 Walter Matthau-Ingrid Bergman comedy ""Cactus Flower for which an ingenue with an amazing haircut named Goldie Hawn won an Oscar. That movie was based on a French play making ""Just Go With It as close as the French might want Sandler near their country.But the weirdness refuses to end there. The remake also has parts for Jennifer Aniston and as an obnoxious power couple Nicole Kidman and the musician Dave Matthews. The number of times men are pounded in the crotch suggests the movie is a comedy but nearly everything else about it says ""science fiction. Kidman whos absent from the movies advertising campaign tends to have that effect. Shes a singular presence -- her height those bones the way she can pump more air into dialogue than Marilyn Monroe and make snow seem tan -- that accessorizes with very little in modern films.Seeing her in junk like this is a bit like watching the Queen of England eat a Taco Bell chalupa. But Kidman is canny. This is an opportunity to connect with the average moviegoer. So here she is in hula dance-off with Aniston and possibly poking fun at her marriage to Tom Cruise. Kidman has a rich imaginative sense of humor and even under these lousy circumstances demonstrates a new ability to self-deprecate without self-destructing. She could use more junk in her life. Still she can do better than this.Sandler plays Danny Maccabee a plastic surgeon who likes to pretend hes married to prevent women from expecting too much the next morning. He gets serious about a woman whos built like a swimsuit model (Brooklyn Decker) but claims to be a math teacher. She finds his adultery appalling. He says hes getting a divorce. She wants to meet the wife. He backs his single-mother office manager Katherine (Aniston) into playing Mrs. Maccabee then ropes in her kids and to be Katherines German boyfriend his idiot cousin (Nick Swardson).The whole family winds up in Hawaii where nothing too funny happens. Lots of people of color -- Hispanics native Hawaiians the comedian Mario Joyner -- are turned into buffoons help or buffoonish help. Though to be fair Swardson whos white is a one-man buffoon buffet.Possibly as an expression of sympathy for the critics who strain to pan his movies in family-friendly publications Sandler and his usual enablers (the screenwriter Allan Loeb and the director Dennis Dugan) this time provide a handy euphemism for fecal doings. Its called a Devlin. This would be where Kidman comes in. She plays Katherines nemesis a woman whose name is made to epitomize this bit of bathroom humor. Devlin pops up in Hawaii and turns the otherwise confident Katherine so petty and insecure that she tells Devlin that Danny is her husband.""Cactus Flower was a silly farce about bachelorhood and sexual liberation with three interesting performances. The remake is almost two hours of gas. Aniston could have been as good as the first movies stars. She has both some of Hawns honeyed cadences and most of her crafted ditziness. But she has nothing smart to play. Watching her over the last few years Ive come to realize that she and Kidman are in the same boat. Theyre short on men who match them. Theyre best here with each other. If were remaking stuff from the 60s why not put them in ""The Odd Couple?Its worth reiterating that this entire enterprise is perilously perched upon the notion that Decker a fashion model is so appealing that theres nobility in upending at least four lives in order to keep bedding her. With all due respect to Decker and the man she has married (the tennis player Andy Roddick) she is not. In the film Decker seems very much like a woman youd find at most gyms or photo shoots. Any movie that asks us to believe even in jest that shes more alluring than Aniston or Kidman is full of Devlin.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Correction Because of a reporters error an earlier version of this review misstated the phony identity of one of the films characters. Dannys cousin impersonates a German.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet At one point in the new Adam Sandler comedy Just Go With It shortly before it transitions from being a romantic comedy with a strained premise into a convoluted slamming-door farce without the energy to do any door-slamming a little girl asks Sandler ""Why dont you tell that poor girl the truth?"" Shes referring to Sandlers young girlfriend--played barely by moonlighting swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker--and referencing the elaborate lie Sandler spun to Decker to make her think he used to be married to the girls mother (Jennifer Aniston) the office manager of his plastic-surgery practice. Smart kid. True if Sandler fessed up there wouldnt be much of a movie but the girl probably senses that Just Go With It isnt much of a movie anyway. Based loosely on the I.A.L. Diamond-scripted 1969 film Cactus Flower (which was in turn based on a Broadway play which was in turn based on a French farce) Just Go With It piles coincidence upon misunderstanding upon mishap with the low ambition and slack energy thats become a Sandler trademark. Theres a fine line between easygoing charm--which Sandler used to generate effortlessly--and relaxed self-congratulation and apart from a few isolated moments with Aniston the subtext of his familiar joyless performance boils down to ""Well you showed up for the last one and here you are again."" And what will showing up this time get Sandler fans? Some silly accents (mostly from frequent Sandler sidekick Nick Swardson unbearable here as an lout who pretends to be German) a tangled plot that might have worked if handled by a filmmaker with more skill than go-to Sandler director Dennis Dugan a lot of gratuitous bikini shots plenty of smutty double entendres a few cute interactions with kids a bit of schmaltz and some life lessons to bring it all home. Also for some reason it will get them a couple played by Dave Matthews and Nicole Kidman the latter trying hard to deliver a fun broad comic performance and looking like an overachiever for her trouble. But mostly Just Go With It offers scenes of Aniston and Sandler deceiving Decker whose inability to see through fabrications that wouldnt fool a canny toddler suggest she might be suffering from some kind of undiagnosed neurological disease. Shes dumb but well-meaning. Aniston and Sandler however play characters too awful to deserve anyone better than each other. But what did we do to deserve them?

No thanks Jen Aniston Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday February 10 2011 926 AM facebook Tweet email Just Go With It starring Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler has plenty of chemistry but its an empty rom-com as a whole. (Sony Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday February 10 2011 926 AM Title Just Go With It Romantic comedy about friends posing as spouses. With Adam Sandler Jennifer Aniston. Director Dennis Dugan (156). PG-13 crude humor sexuality. At area theaters. What is it with Jennifer Aniston? Commitment issues? Low self-esteem? Because theres got to be a reason she makes so many poor choices. Im speaking of course about her taste in scripts which is so baffling its time to suggest either therapy or a change in management. The curse strikes again in ""Just Go With It"" a witless rom-com that is only marginally watchable thanks to Aniston and her costar Adam Sandler. They do work well together in the sense that both are charismatic pros who know how to sell a project. But frankly its depressing to watch two likable talents pushing such a blatantly empty experience. The suspension of disbelief begins immediately when we learn Anistons Katherine is a frumpy single receptionist working for Sandlers Danny a playboy plastic surgeon. Meanwhile supermodel Brooklyn Decker plays Palmer the twentysomething teacher who falls instantly for Danny. Unfortunately their romance hits a snag when she finds the fake wedding ring he uses to seduce single women. Since he implies hes getting a divorce she insists on meeting his ex -- to be played of course by Katherine. And once Katherines kids appear Danny has to pretend theyre his too even when they all end up in Hawaii together. Naturally further complications ensue especially when Katherines nemesis (Nicole Kidman simultaneously frozen and broad) suddenly arrives with her pushy husband (Dave Matthews). Writers Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling have lazily adapted their crude formulaic screenplay from 1969s ""Cactus Flower"" a movie that also relied heavily on the charms of its leads (including an Oscar-winning Goldie Hawn). Unlike Hawn however Decker brings only her obvious assets to the role so director Dennis Dugan shoots her swimming and showering leaving the heavy lifting to the experts. Sandler whos worked with Dugan since ""Happy Gilmore"" is so relaxed and amiable it often seems as though hes improvising. And Aniston keeps up nicely with a looseness thats been lacking in her recent films. But that only makes this wasted opportunity--which never feels like anything more than a swiftly-brokered deal between their agents--increasingly frustrating. And when our ever-underachieving heroine looks at the beautiful utterly bland Decker and sighs ""Im not that"" you cant help wishing shed say it with a little more pride. Just Go With It starring Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler has plenty of chemistry but its an empty rom-com as a whole. (Columbia Pictures) Dont Miss Its no surprise when Decker rocks a bikini. But who would have expected Kidman and Aniston to throw down in the fiercest hula battle in cinematic history?
