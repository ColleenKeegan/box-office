In the 70s he was probably the first slab of macho to domesticate his image by teaming with a costar worthy of a Dean Jones kiddie comedy. From there it wasnt such a big leap to Arnold and Kindergarten Cop and now God help us The Pacifier a yawn-by-numbers romper-room dud that is nevertheless shrewd enough to tweak its star Vin Diesel for becoming a joke in less time than it took him to become an action hero. Playing babysitter to a family of brats (hes a Navy SEAL in case you were wondering; theyre an assassinated scientists children whom hes been assigned to protect) Diesel who looks like Uncle Festers frat-house-hooligan son doesnt interact with anyone. He just barks orders in that muscle-lipped monotone. You havent experienced a disgruntled lunks bad timing until youve seen a slice of baloney drop onto Vin who after a pause of about three hours croaks out the line ""This is my favorite shirt"" The Pacifier appears to have been a good career move but even Diesel may live to regret it when he discovers what flubber awaits him.

No they have to roll out Vin Diesel as Shane Wolf a Navy SEAL who gets wounded on a failed mission to protect a scientist from outside forces. When he recovers Shane is dispatched to the scientists home where he must baby-sit and protect the family from further reprisals. He must also locate a very important disk containing sensitive information believed to be hidden somewhere around the house. The movie basically consists of Shanes on-the-job training as a suburban den daddy. Cue all the expected gags baby puke on his shoulder; conflict-prone teenagers with needs boyfriends and attitude; and a sense that the big guys are coming at any moment. Well the baddies come all right dressed as ninjas. Theyre less scary than the burglars in ""Home Alone."" With a disk this important youd expect a little more trouble. Of course its a PG movie but do family audiences deserve stupid and trite stories? _____More in Movies_____  The Pacifier National Showtimes  Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Oscars Coverage  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Diesel whose acting wouldnt merit a non-speaking walk-on role in a dinner theater production is supposed to be a muscular fish out of water. But unlike Schwarzenegger theres nothing endearing or amusing about his woodenness. Hes all splinters. When Diesel switches his macho gun belt for a fanny pack when are we supposed to start laughing? Sometime during the movie? Its unclear. With no real comedy to enjoy its torture to watch Diesel undergo a predictable change from emotionless soldier to loving family man. Makes you want to spit out your pacifier in disgust. THE PACIFIER (PG 94 minutes) --Contains slapstick violence and Vin Diesel. Area theaters.

Now theres Vin Diesels latest Dirty Diapers-- or if you prefer Full Metal Nanny. In good hands? Vin Diesels Shane Wolfe is put in charge of five siblings including Baby Tyler (Bo Vink). Disney Whatever you want to call it Disneys The Pacifier is low on Diesel fuel though probably amusing enough if youre part of the intended demographic which appears to be the age group that likes to stick fingers up noses. Harmless as it is this is no pacifier for anyone much older. If you didnt know this was a kids movie the perfunctory opening action sequence might throw you off. Diesel is introduced as a tough Navy S.E.A.L. we see blowing a helicopter out of the sky. Diesel takes a bullet and the government scientist hes trying to rescue is killed. About the movie The Pacifier   (out of four) Stars Vin Diesel Lauren Graham Faith Ford Brittany Snow Max Thieriot Director Adam Shankman Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Rated PG for action violence language and rude humor Opens Friday nationwide A clashing segue takes us to suburban Washington D.C. where our quickly recovered hero is ordered to care for the victims five kids while their mother (Faith Ford) goes overseas for reasons having to do with a top-secret ""program"" Dad invented. Included are a baby (hence the onslaught of diaper jokes) and adolescents of both sexes. The daughter (Brittany Snow -- great name) probably could be a different kind of trouble in a different kind of movie but here she is standard-issue pouty the kind who says ""That is so gross"" and who is desperate to get to the mall for the sale on halter tops. The children are rebels but Diesel knocks them into shape -- that is when hes not wrecking the homes top floor battling martial-arts villains who have invaded and subduing the schools bully of a vice principal. This comes easier to him than the domestic stuff which leads to one line of Diesel dialogue that kind of sums up the movie ""I dont do cookies."" Gilmore Girls inherently likable Lauren Graham who managed to be sweet in even Bad Santa plays a high school principal who is too good to be true. Give credit as well to the middle child (Morgan York) who could be a newspaper columnist in the making. With dicey but penetrating concern she looks Diesel in the eye and asks ""Why are your boobs so big?""

Starring Vin Diesel Lauren Graham Carol Kane Brad Garrett Morgan York. Directed by Adam Shankman. Written by Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant. (PG. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Every big-muscled actor has to make a kiddie comedy eventually just as he must govern a West Coast state someday. Its all part of being a well- rounded action hero. Unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger however Vin Diesel shows no discernible comedic skills. Yet Diesel works fine in ""The Pacifier"" because hes a good sport allowing himself to look as awkward or cuddly as the movie dictates. A formulaic Disney comedy directed by Adam Shankman (""Bringing Down the House"") the film exists for the visual absurdity of the big guy changing diapers or teaching martial arts to Girl Scouts (called ""Fireflies"" here). These moments are familiar but not so familiar they cant produce a chuckle or two. Diesel plays Shane a Navy SEAL charged with protecting the five offspring of a security expert killed during one of Shanes missions. Mom (Faith Ford) has been summoned to Switzerland on matters of national importance. In this case ""national importance"" translates to ""get the mother character out of the house so Vin Diesel can come in."" Related Stories Muscle mans a sensitive SEAL Deft comedic performers adult and juvenile surround Diesel. Carol Kane sporting unkempt hair and two inches of gray roots plays a squirrelly Czech nanny whos supposed to wrangle the squirts while Shane keeps an eye out for bad guys. Kane can elicit a laugh with a simple pointed look and she never breaks character even when Diesel carries her under his arm for an extended period. But if the nanny stayed we wouldnt be able to see Diesel plunk his hand into an open used diaper. So shes quickly out of there with Brad Garrett from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" taking up her slack. He plays the creepy vice principal at the high school attended by the two rebellious older Plummer kids (Brittany Snow from TVs ""American Dreams"" and Max Thieriot from the family that once owned The Chronicle). Garrett brings quiet misguided conviction to his bully character. Hes certain he can outwrestle Shane even though he notes that Shanes arms are the size of other peoples legs. Lauren Graham appears as the high schools principal who is kind gorgeous and a Navy veteran. Picture Diesel and Graham together. They have just as much chemistry as you might expect. The real lady in Shanes life is little Lulu Plummer played by the adorable Morgan York. Her character questions Shane about his prominent pecs or as she calls them ""boobs."" Screenwriters Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant -- the team behind inexplicably both the lame Queen Latifah comedy ""Taxi"" and the hilarious Comedy Central show ""Reno 911"" -- go too far by evoking ""The Sound of Music.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Vin Diesel ""The Pacifier"" or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- Halfway through the so-called comedy ""The Pacifier"" Vin Diesel -- in an ill-conceived effort to save one of his young charges -- jumps into a sewer and becomes covered head to toe in human excrement. This scene could be a metaphor for the entire film.Without doubt the worst film of the year so far ""The Pacifier"" is actually painful to watch.The film begins with a ludicrous scene in which Diesel as Navy SEAL Shane Wolfe and his team are trying to save a kidnapped American scientist Howard Plummer (Tate Donovan) from his Middle Eastern captors. Every action scene cliche in the book is thrown up on the screen in this ridiculously cheesy opening sequence.Plummer who has invented a secret weapon is killed in the operation. Getting knocked off early in this film is the best career move Donovan has made in years. (And this is a guy whos been in ""SpaceCamp"" and ""Swordfish."")Because the weapon may be stashed in Plummers home Wolfe is suddenly assigned to guard the scientists five children from a possible attack on the house. Meanwhile Plummers widow Julie (Faith Ford) goes to Europe with a naval officer to unlock a bank vault in Switzerland where information about the weapon may also be hidden.Wolfes job is part baby-sitting job and part military mission. This is supposed to create many hilarious situations -- a SEAL out of water if you will.It doesnt.Diaper jokesThe characters of the three older kids are all cardboard cutouts straight out of a bad sitcom.Theres the oldest daughter Zoe (Brittany Snow) whos going through a rebellious teenage phase. The 14-year-old son Seth (Max Thieriot) is withdrawn and sullen. The 8-year-old girl Lulu (Morgan York) is whiny and needy. The two younger kids a toddler named Peter and an infant named Tyler are merely props used to create poopie diaper jokes.The gags here really make you gag.This lame premise of a super-macho military guy thrown into domestic chaos in the suburbs is not only predictable its insulting to the audience. The script by Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant is obviously a rip-off of Arnold Schwarzeneggers ""Kindergarden Cop"" and makes that 1990 film look like a cinematic masterpiece.Adam Shankman whose main claim to fame is ""Bringing Down The House"" directs this film with a sledgehammer. Every so-called joke is telegraphed by Western Union and is dead on arrival.Lauren Graham (TVs ""The Gilmore Girls"") plays a sappy-sweet principal at the childrens school with a blatant crush on Wolfe and Brad Garrett (""Everybody Loves Raymond"") plays a pompous vice principal and wrestling coach. Both have the good sense to appear to be embarrassed to be in this bad comedy sketch disguised as a film.Theres nothing wrong with Vin Diesel trying to broaden his action hero image but next time he wades into comedy the script should have something going for it beyond a dozen or so poop jokes.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

If auds swallow this odoriferous exercise in calculated career repositioning theyll swallow anything. Even two years ago could Vin Diesel have imagined starring in a movie that would require his macho self to dive head-first into a kiddy playpen filled with colored plastic balls and emerge triumphantly with a soiled diaper in hand? Yet such is the tenor of the humor in ""The Pacifier"" a truly gag-worthy comedy designed to open up new horizons for the flagging action hero by having him baby-sit a family of obnoxious brats. If auds swallow this odoriferous exercise in calculated career repositioning theyll swallow anything. But the ""Daddy Day Care"" crowd may well be lying in wait. Best when hes brooding and truculent Diesel who lacks the grace and timing of a natural comic actor here attempts the sort of image shift that Arnold Schwarzenegger pulled off at a significantly more advanced stage of his screen career by self-consciously sending up his muscleman persona in mainstream comedy. Three important differences Diesel hasnt remotely established the sort of public profile that Schwarzenegger had when he went comic; he hasnt surrounded himself with such skilled talent; and his material is significantly more ridiculous. Its hard to imagine mature adults in the upper echelons of the motion picture business getting excited about a script whose biggest laugh line has a little girl looking at the shirtless Diesel character and asking ""Why are your boobs so big?"" But similar juvenile humor graced screenwriters Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garants ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" script last year so everyone knew what they were getting into. Suspicious cultural watchdogs may also detect a subliminal message about how American youth must now be militarily indoctrinated at a very early age. Diesel plays Navy S.E.A.L. Shane Wolfe a military lifer briefly assigned to protect the family of a scientist who Shane couldnt prevent from being assassinated. While Mom (Faith Ford) is away trying to get her hands on the literal key to her late husbands legacy Shane confronts a five-kid household he finds woefully lacking in discipline manners and obedience training. But even the by-the-books Shane cant prevent the little ones from barfing pooping and farting as they please or the household duck from attacking him the way Mike Tyson did Evander Holyfield. Loading his ammo belt with milk bottles for the tyke and imposing 6 a.m. reveille even on Sunday Shane is disrespected by headstrong teen Zoe (Brittany Snow) and withdrawn Seth (Max Thieriot) as well as by Helga (Carol Kane) a nanny of Transylvanian whiteness who would have seemed more at home in ""The Addams Family."" As if on automatic scriptwriting pilot however the kids gradually come around to a grudging affection for the domineering soldier who manages to turn Zoe from a hopeless drivers ed student into an ace getaway driver and in the scripts most jaw-droppingly peculiar turn saves the day for aspiring actor Seth by stepping in as director of a little theater production of ""The Sound of Music"" a move that also positions Shane as a would-be Captain Von Trapp at home. Climactic action rates on the credibility scale with Macaulay Culkin taking on the baddies in ""Home Alone."" The one genuinely comic contribution is supplied by ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" big man Brad Garrett. He scores strongly as a blustery high school vice principal and wrestling coach who ill-advisedly challenges Shane to a match. Lauren Graham is thoroughly wasted as the school principal and a former Navy girl who takes an innocuous shine to the strapping babysitter. John Debneys score leans on mock military strains for most of its effect while Bethesda looks a whole lot like Toronto here. Costco is plugged to an obnoxious degree.

"Pacifier The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pacifier-the ) Pacifier The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Pacifiers are for infants. The same is true of The Pacifier. In fact ""infantile"" may be the best single word to describe this Kindergarten Cop wannabe. Vin Diesel is better than the material but no matter how hard he tries he cant rise above the puerile screenplay credited to Thomas Lennon amp; Robert Ben Garant. The Pacifier is offensive because it offers little more than unleavened stupidity in the place of the family-friendly action and comedy it promises. The under/over age for viewers of The Pacifier is about 10. It has enough poop jokes to keep very young potential audience members engaged but not enough content to attract tweens or teens. Adults will vacillate between thoughts of self-mutilation and wanting to do unspeakable things to director Adam Shankman (whose impeccable filmmaking resume includes such titles as The Wedding Planner and A Walk to Remember). Creatively sadistic children who can dupe their parents into using The Pacifier as a family outing will get a chance to avenge all those wrongful groundings. Diesel plays Navy SEAL Shane Wolfe who is given the top-secret assignment of babysitting five kids when their mother Julie Plummer (Faith Ford) must go overseas to investigate the contents of her late husbands safety deposit box. It seems that Professor Plummer before being murdered in the library with a lead pipe had invented something called GHOST - one of those generic super secret devices that promises world peace in the right hands and Armageddon in the wrong ones. Since nefarious persons could be out to foul things up by harming Julies kids Shane is brought in to be their protector. He sees this as an opportunity to apply a little discipline but of course it all backfires. Didnt this happen to Hulk Hogan in Mr. Nanny? The Plummer kids range in age from infancy to nearly-ready-for-college. The oldest Zoe (Brittany Snow) is horrified at being told what to do by such an uncool uncouth fascist. Seth (Max Thieriot) is too busy brooding and being bullied in school to take much notice. Lulu (Morgan York) kind-of likes Shane. And the two youngest Peter and the baby dont much care. Theres also a nanny named Helga who exits as soon as Carol Kane has had enough screen time to justify her paycheck. The films ultimate destination is not finding GHOST but building a relationship of trust and caring between Shane and the kids. A love interest is tossed into the mix in the person of the Plummers principal Claire (Lauren Graham). Why? Because no live-action Disney movie is complete without a nice PG-rated romance. (It may be of interest to some that one of Grahams most memorable roles was as the sex-obsessed woman with a Santa fetish in Bad Santa.) We are subjected to at least three staples of this sort of movie Shane attempting to deal with a dirty diaper the Navy SEAL getting stuck behind the wheel of a mini-van and the kindhearted burly brute arriving home to discover that Zoe has decided to throw a party without his permission. In the end Shane wins over each of the children in a different way. With Zoe its teaching her how to drive. With Seth its directing his amateur production of ""The Sound of Music."" With Lulu its teaching her brownie troupe how to get tough with the cub scouts. With Peter its giving a stirring rendition of the ""Peter Panda Song."" And with the baby its keeping those diapers clean. Now thats drama. When Arnold Schwarzenegger made Kindergarten Cop he was already a proven box office draw with a successful comedy (Twins) under his belt. He was also working with a proven director (Ivan Reitman) and an enjoyable script. None of these things are true of The Pacifier and it shows. This is a sloppy movie whose lackluster action sequences serve only to offer a momentary respite from the flaccid comedy/drama that comprises the majority of the running length. Those hoping for a few feeble laughs are likely to be disappointed. The sole redeeming quality of the movie is Vin Diesel but it doesnt take long before his charisma is snuffed out. This Pacifier deserves to be chewed up and spat out.
