Milnes 1920s childrens...2000-02-18 C The Tigger Movie Genre Animation Comedy; Starring John Hurt Jim Cummings; Runtime (in minutes) 70; MPAA Rating G Posted February 18 2000 -- 1200 AM EST Walt Disney latched on to Winnie the Poohs honey pots as renewable resources back in 1961 when he bought the rights to A.A. Milnes 1920s childrens books featuring a phlegmatic British teddy bear and his excitable friends. Since then the studio has run a tidy sideline in Pooh featurettes and television shows of which The Tigger Movie is the first full-length production to fill the screen. (Children who saw the last short Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore in theaters in 1983 are now strapping men and women who will instantly recognize the endomorphic similarities between Winnie and King of the Hills phlegmatic Texan cub Bobby.) The feature debut of young writer-director Jun Falkenstein this gentle disposable story reunites all the regulars in the Hundred Acre Wood -- Pooh and Piglet Kanga and Roo Rabbit and Eeyore and Owl. But for all the classic touches including songs by Disney veterans Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman (Mary Poppins) and animation with the old-fashioned look of the original book illustrations by E.H. Shepard The Tigger Movie is a conflicted entertainment compromised by trying too hard to impress the restless self-referential adults in the audience. Its trendy enough when Tigger existentially lonely and searching for relatives who look and bounce like him comes to realize (as many who left home to work at Disney and go into psychotherapy probably have) that friends are his true family. But when jokey visual references to adult pop culture flash by while the tiger sings of self-actualization (at one point hes posed like Marilyn Monroe skirt billowing a la The Seven Year Itch) The Tigger Movie loses its way. Pooh on a Tigger that would rather party with the hip grown-up audience for Aladdin or Toy Story than do the hard work of charming children the antique way on their own exacting terms.

Voice of Jim Cummings. Directed by Jun Falkenstein. VHS and DVD. (G. 76 minutes.) One of Disneys most inspired animated empires is contained in the Hundred Acre Wood adapted from A.A. Milne s ""Winnie the Pooh."" Its wonderful gentle spirit continues with ""The Tigger Movie."" Its the first full-length animated feature based on Pooh material and fans have cause to cheer. ""The Tigger Movie"" stands as Disneys lovely cartoon shrine to the classic characters. Anybody who first saw Tigger and learned the wonderful things about him more than 20 years ago is going to feel great as will the very young who have been raised on Pooh and Co. one of the few cartoons that avoids hostility and violence. Tigger is the tiger who is so full of jolly enthusiasm that he lights up the very world he disrupts. Hes perhaps the only character in Poohdom able to sustain a full-length feature. One does miss the extraordinary voice of Paul Winchells Tigger from the previous animated shorts but Jim Cummings who is Poohs voice in the film is an able replacement. Though it focuses on Tigger the film also has Pooh Rabbit Piglet Eeyore Owl Kanga Roo and Christopher Robin. Tigger is bouncy as can be but most of the others are busy getting ready for winter. The film has autumnal and wintry hues with cutaways to turning book pages. Tigger is urged to seek others like himself to help celebrate his unique qualities. On his rather lonely quest Tigger has several adventures and ultimately learns the meaning of family.
