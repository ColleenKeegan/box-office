Still some of the kids at the screening laughed a smidge which is more than one can say for this summers other family fodder. But I digress...Zookeeper is a kiddie romcom about Griffin an affable portly fellow (James) who loves his job caring for the animals at an unspecified city zoo. But theres something missing... If only he could somehow re-woo Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) the flash flakey floozy who dumped him five years earlier his life would surely be complete. At this juncture one of the zoos lions (voiced by Sly Stallone) suddenly cracks a quip and the rest of the animals follow suit including a monkey (Adam Sandler) youll soon come to despise. In one of the most ridiculous scenarios to have ever soiled the screen the unfeasibly cunning creatures hatch a plan to reunite the couple... but not before Griffin has been coaxed into learning a few basic animal instincts.The films amusing opener shows some promise but the moment the animals start mouthing off and uttering bum-sniffing jokes we know which way its heading. With the exception of Nick Noltes likeably gruff gorilla all the voice cast are poorly matched. But thats just one foible in a catalogue of errors driven by a script that falters at regular intervals and a structure that encompasses a jumble of scenes seemingly cast at random. Still TGI Fridays will be happy with one of the longest product placement scenes in history. Funniest moments? The outtakes during the closing credits. I rest my case.

Columbia Pictures-Sony/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The great film director John Huston was once asked what he would wish for if he had only one wish. He replied that hed like to get together with all the animals he had ever known and loved in his life and have a conversation with them.If Huston were alive today and saw ""Zookeeper"" he might have second thoughts. He might also to his credit walk out on this numbingly inane comedy. I dear reader had to stick it out.Kevin James plays Griffin a Boston zookeeper jilted by his golden girl fiancee who discovers that the animals in his care are capable of talking to him. What they say however is so unfunny and uninspired that you kind of wish they would just shut up. This goes double for the humans. How is it possible that a movie with five credited screenwriters can have such a nothing script? As long as were on the subject of animals I think there should be a subdivision of the ASPCA -- American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Audiences.

These bickering bears the grouchy lion couple the smart-aleck monkey the hip-hopping rhyming giraffe among others hope that if Griffin is happy hell stick around. Husky comic actor Kevin James portrays the zookeeper who believes his job is getting in the way of a lasting relationship. In its opening moments ""Zookeeper"" reveals how Griffin arrived at such a boneheaded notion The mild-mannered zookeeper goes impressively romantic on a beach with his girlfriend only to be shot down by the fashion-forward Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). Evidently he cant be a keeper if hes just a zookeeper. brightcove.createExperiences(); Its her problem of course. But as much as he loves his job he makes her doubts about his prospects his own when he sees Stephanie five years later at his brothers engagement party. Shes interested. But has she changed her mind about changing him? What do you think? Luminous and game for a comedic stretch Rosario Dawson plays Kate. Shes a veterinarian visiting the zoo to introduce two eagles to cohabitation. Will Griffin change Stephanie? Will Stephanie ruin Griffin? Can the beast lighten his burdens? And what about Kate? There is little in this PG comedy that -- nods to Sebastian the Wolf -- any sharp-nosed moviegoer wont smell coming from miles away. But that doesnt get in the way of its pleasures. Did we mention that things just go better with Kevin James? Well-trodden comedy hooks become strangely more amusing. Goofball physical shtick elicits broader smiles. The bumblingly stupid is made endearing. (I remain fond of the lamebrained but innocent ""Paul Blart Mall Cop."") When Griffin takes flight at his brothers wedding (dont ask) he looks blissed though a crash is inevitable. Amusingly sturdy support comes by way of the voice cast of the creatures. What would a Kevin James movie be without Adam Sandler (and vice versa)? He gives hilarious voice to Donald a wiry wisecracking capuchin monkey whos all about thumbs. And ""Zookeeper"" makes the casting of Cher and Sylvester Stallone as a couple seem long overdue. Sly plays Joe the lion. Cher is Janet the power behind this pride of two. Nick Nolte provides the grim if hopeful observations of Bernie an exiled gorilla. Not all the zoo workers it seems are animal lovers. Bernies had a run-in with one. Donnie Wahlberg portrays Shane as just a shade shy of being too cruel for the audiences youngest. All the animals in the film are played by actual animals except Bernie which the movie uses to amusing affect. ""Zookeeper"" swings on the notion of a kind of reverse anthropomorphizing with the animals projecting their habits and experiences onto Griffin. Mark your territory with style the wolf schools him. ""Lead with your pudding cup"" the bears advise. Its a phrase worthy of a Prince ly ric and pretty much as naughty as things get in this PG tale. Among the biped performers comedian Kim Jeong is alternately deadpan and slithering toward sleaze as Venom the zoos reptile expert. Its time to caution the talented Jeong about the pitfalls of doing one riff too well. (He had similarly unhinged moments in the ""Transformers"" sequel and in ""The Hangover Part II."") We laughed a lot. We teared a couple of times. Mostly -- and its becoming a habit -- we just appreciated the blundering wonder that is Kevin George Knipfing a.k.a. Kevin James.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 08 2011 1201AM EDT Last updated Tuesday Jul. 12 2011 551PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English After nine seasons starring as a married overweight parcel delivery driver on the TV sitcom King of Queens former everyman stand-up comedian Kevin James hit box-office gold in 2009 with his first big-screen starring role in Paul Blart Mall Cop. Comparatively speaking his vocational comedy follow-up Zookeeper is a predictable pile of doo-doo. For starters the movie doesnt even have a decent animal poo joke. (And having visited a zoo this past week with a bunch of kids I can testify that animal droppings are always funny. Every time.) Kevin James in a scene from the new movie Zookeeper. Sony Pictures/YouTube Multimedia Zookeeper The official trailer Despite negative reviews Mall Cop won over audiences because James created an oddball character to cheer for - a broadly played hypoglycemic mustached Segway-riding single dad who uses specialized knowledge of his workplace to thwart a hostage-taking gang of mall thieves. James more buff than blubber this time out showcases his physical-comedy chops again as the romantically challenged Griffin Keyes the top animal keeper at the inner-city Franklin Park Zoo. But the slapstick feels self-consciously played as opposed to something arising naturally from the character. Which brings us to the main reason Zookeeper stinks (despite the aforementioned lack of poop). While James mall cop pursued generally noble motives his zookeeper spends most of his screen time dedicated to a goal we arent even supposed to get behind - winning back the affections of his gorgeous ex-girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). Shes a vacuous high-fashion buyer whom we know from the opening scene wants Griffin to change completely. In any case he needs some new moves. Just like James King of Queens character Griffin is surrounded by unsolicited advice. The zoo critters reveal their (celebrity) voices - to his initial horror - when they become worried he might ditch them for a job at his soon-to-be-married brothers luxury car dealership. One by one they teach him various ahem techniques (stance marking territory isolating your prey etc.). He tries them out at various pre-wedding events without much success until he adopts the behaviour of a predatory boor and wins back Stephanie who convinces him to take the job with his brother. Up to this point the stray laughs have come from semi-improvised lines delivered by the comedians on the voice-talent roster and a small role by reliable scene-stealer Ken Jeong as reptile-keeper Venom. Then suddenly - and far too late to save the movie - James gets funny revelling in Griffins stint as a super-aggressive car salesman. This may not be his characters true calling but it sure seems like James. Its clear from the start that zoo veterinarian Kate (Rosario Dawson) is a much more suitable mate for Griffin. So we cant even cheer for the talking animals because theyre abetting Griffin in his misguided romantic quest (despite the fact that they want it to fail so he will stay on as zookeeper. Dont ask - it doesnt make sense) Sure this movie is pure fantasy but as family fare it has several elements that many will find irresponsible - most notably the male silverback gorilla Bernie (Nick Nolte) who has been kept for years in a solitary confinement pit for a violent act he didnt commit. Unfortunately nobody had the good sense to call the comedy authorities and shut this Zookeeper down.

(Tracy Bennett) Joe Neumaier Friday July 8 2011 400 AM Title Zookeeper With Kevin James Rosario Dawson. Animals give a zoo employee love-life advice. Director Frank Coraci (144). PG. At area theaters.""Zookeeper"" is a childrens comedy about talking animals that feels as if it were written by children or perhaps by talking animals.Which isnt bad if youre under 8. Even then though this wacky family movie is split between ""Dr. Dolittle""-like chattering critters and a Kevin James slapstick relationship comedy.James plays Griffin Constantine Keyes a mild-mannered zoo employee whose relationship with superficial fashion model Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) fell apart because she didnt want to be married to a zookeeper. But working at a Boston zoo is what Griffin was born to do. So when he runs into Stephanie years later the animals break an age-old rule and reveal that they can talk to help Griffin get a leg -- or a paw hoof or claw as the case may be -- up on Stephanies doofus-cool guy boyfriend Gale (Joe Rogan). While Griffin learns the secrets of the wild kingdom he also sniffs out a better mate his co-worker Kate (ever-charming Rosario Dawson).James certainly knows his strength The former ""King of Queens"" star isnt afraid to look stupid just like the movie. However while animatronic animals and beasts with digitally altered jaws may make tots giggle when Griffins best gorilla pal Bernie speaks in Nick Noltes grandpa-woke-up-angry voice all ages will shudder.Bernie endures some abuse at the hands of Donnie Wahlbergs doofus-mean guy zoo worker but the other animals are a bit more fun. Adam Sandler is a goofy-voiced capuchin monkey (the third capuchin this summer for those keeping score) Sylvester Stallone is a take-charge lion and Cher is a mellow lioness.But kids who get a kick out of the quadrupeds may not understand a dinner scene in which Griffin acts alpha by being rude to Stephanie; what the appeal is to being a car salesman or why Griffin makes subpar comedy-club insults to the guests at a fashionista shindig.The kids will want more of the sassy crow and jackass monkey. An animatronic gorilla could tell you that.Magic Moment During the end credits watch as the ostrich Kevin James hops on is revealed to be a guy in a green-screen CGI outfit.

"Adam Sandlers Zookeeper Something stinks - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Adam Sandlers Zookeeper Something stinks By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions The animals arent completely to blame for Zookeeper. Unless they made it. By Tracy Bennett Columbia Pictures When caring Griffin (Kevin James) finds himself forced to reconsider his zookeeping job the animals have something to say about it. EnlargeClose By Tracy Bennett Columbia Pictures When caring Griffin (Kevin James) finds himself forced to reconsider his zookeeping job the animals have something to say about it. Which is possible. Its hard to think of a human finding much to laugh about in this wounded beast. Like nearly any film smudged by Adam Sandler who produced and provided a voice to Zookeeper there isnt much in the way of plot to get in the way of Sandlers world Theres poo ripped pants and hot girls falling for fat guys. We are quickly introduced to Griffin (Kevin James who has become Americas palooka). Griffin is a caring zookeeper one who has earned the trust of his charges if not his girlfriend. MORE Kevin James opens up in interview PHOTOS Kevin James at work and play But the lovely blond shrew Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) believes Griffin has more potential as a car salesman. So shell cut off the monkeying around if he wont cut out the monkeys. With little explanation the animals decide to stage a protest. Apparently they can talk -- and always have been. They make the simians from Planet of the Apes look like monkey monks who took a vow of silence. It was time to speak up they explain because good help is hard to find. Particularly someone who doesnt mind hauling feces and taking advice from hyenas. About the movie Zookeeper 1/2 out of fourStars Kevin James Leslie Bibb Rosario Dawson Director Frank Coraci Distributor Sony Pictures Rating PG-13 for some rude and suggestive humor and language Running time 1 hour 41 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The animals offer ill-fated lessons on pitching woo including impressing a mate by marking territory. Given how much money Sandler has made with similar train wrecks this feels cheap. Director Frank Coraci sprinkles scenes that look as if voices were dubbed to natural animal action; other animals get computer-generated maws. Sony Pictures couldve seen this coming. When the studio brought the film and zoo animals to Las Vegas for a spring preview a bear cub urinated onstage. A quick-witted Sony exec saved the moment. ""Thanks for sharing"" he said. Ditto.

Starring Kevin James Rosario Dawson Director Frank Coraci Release Opened Jul 8 2011  Editorial Review If he could talk to the animalsBy Sean OConnellFriday July 8 2011For some reason Kevin Jamess pain is his audiences pleasure. Theres no tree he wont swing into no pole he wont headbutt and no staircase he wont throw his seemingly indestructible body down in the name of comedy. Box office receipts confirm that his audience laps up this self-inflicted physical abuse. Pratfalls and agonizing tumbles appear to be Jamess business and man business is booming. The irony is that James happens to be a naturally affable actor who has created likable lead characters in such one-to-two-note fluff flicks as ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" or ""Grown Ups"" so we shouldnt want to see him get bruised and battered either emotionally or physically. Hes at his best when his enormous heart and innate vulnerability shine through the slapstick antics screenwriters love to throw at him which happens to be the case in Frank Coracis ""Zookeeper.""The film opens on a beach at sunset where Griffin Keyes (James) has rented a horse and hired a mariachi band so he can propose to his girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). But she turns him down. Vapid and self-centered Stephanie cant get over the fact that Griffins a zookeeper. Years later Griffin is ready to move past the devastating funk brought on by Stephanies rejection when the statuesque beauty slides back into his life. Thankfully our hero finds motivational support from his sensitive co-worker Kate (Rosario Dawson) and the animals at Griffins zoo.Thats right. Faster than you can say ""Doctor Doolittle"" the beasts in Griffins social circle begin to spew advice and dating tips. It turns out animals always could communicate with humans. They just chose to follow a code that prevented such behavior because it tends to freak people out. Because Griffins situation is dire the zoo animals agree to speak up. Lions voiced by Sylvester Stallone and Cher teach him not to be so cowardly. A bear voiced by Jon Favreau explains the importance of urinating on ones territory. I half expected Favreaus bear to swipe dialogue from the actor-directors classic dating exercise ""Swingers"" telling James he was ""so money"" as he tried to win over ""beautiful babies."" Then theres a monkey voiced by Adam Sandler who suggests Griffin throw his feces at Stephanie -- just what youd expect a monkey voiced by Sandler to say.Such jokes in the ""Zookeeper"" script speak directly to the youngest audience members but writers Nick Bakay Rock Reuben and James himself havent left mom and dad out of the mix. Theres a surreal quality to some of ""Zookeepers"" humor that will fly over the heads of kids as it has parents scratching their own noggins in disbelief. One sequence has Griffin bringing a Nick Nolte-voiced gorilla to a T.G.I. Fridays for drinks karaoke and convenient product placement. A choreographed stunt at a wedding reception allows James to take flight using curtains that hang from a ceiling (until he crashes into an ice sculpture and takes out the bride). Casting carries ""Zookeeper"" over its roughest patches. The vocal guest stars are inspired. Comedian Joe Rogan brings a mean-spirited edge to the part of Stephanies old boyfriend a decent foil for Jamess good-natured character. Dawson is quite comfortable playing the charismatic and fun girl we eventually want our main guy to fall for a part she fine-tuned in Kevin Smiths ""Clerks 2."" And important lessons about being true to oneself actually penetrate the clattering noises made every time James falls down. In a summer season where a familys film options so far have been a lukewarm ""Mr. Poppers Penguins"" and the downright disappointing ""Cars 2"" Coracis ""Zookeeper"" -- yes it surprises me as much as anyone -- ends up being something of well a keeper.Contains some rude and suggestive humor and language.

Credit Sony Pictures Entertainment He aint Doctor Dolittle but he talks to the animals and thats because they talk to him. He is Griffin the nice-guy zookeeper hero of this nice-guy comedy about being yourself doing what you love and winning the girl.""Zookeeper"" is pretty much the Kevin James show he plays the lead role had a hand in the script and is one of the films producers. His Griffin is a hapless sweetie who after being rejected by his blond dream girl Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) takes love advice from the animals unlock your inner bear scratch yourself on a tree mark your territory.To list all the heavyweights who lend their voices to the animals would take up the rest of this review but they include Judd Apatow Maya Rudolph Sylvester Stallone Cher Don Rickles and Adam Sandler as a particularly unintelligible monkey.. Thats a lot of talent for these not-very-charming animals which are hybrids of live action and animation.That may not bother the target audience. The two little girls leaving the theater behind me each rated the movie a 10 and then proceeded to name their favorite characters (another long list).""Zookeeper"" though resembles its hero whom one of Stephanies friends a high-handed fashionista calls ""a chaotic pile of a man."" (All the best lines are throwaways.) The director Frank Coraci (""The Wedding Singer"") doesnt impose much discipline letting some scenes run wild and others peter out their punch lines dangling. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But its hard to completely dislike a movie in which Mr. James makes like Fay Wray hitching a ride on the back of his gorilla pal Bernie (voiced by Nick Nolte) as Bernie clambers up a bridge.The bridge scene is the culmination of the buddy part of this picture (Griffin and Bernie BFFs). The love story part is too clumsily predictable to be satisfying even if Rosario Dawson as a kind veterinarian and the likable Mr. James make an appealing couple. I give them a 6 and the film a 4. (Sorry girls.) My favorite character? Well thats just the problem.""Zookeeper"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There are potty jokes and a creepy pansexual (though appropriately intraspecies) reptile keeper.ZOOKEEPEROpens on Friday nationwide.

Kevin James in the title role solicits romantic advice from computer-generated animals voiced by Nick Nolte Sylvester Stallone Cher and co-producer Adam Sandler in ""Zookeeper"" an alleged comedy from Frank Coraci the director of Sandlers ""The Waterboy."" Need I really say more? This one is strictly for James hard-core fans and anyone wishing to witness the sole appearance of the once-mighty MGM lion on a new feature this year. Dumped by shallow supermodel Leslie Bibb when he proposes marriage our idiotic hero is still pining for her five years later when she inexplicably turns up as a guest at his brothers wedding. By this point James veterinarian at a Boston zoo is doing the Dr. Doolittle thing with his talky menagerie which includes a Sandler-voiced capuchin monkey and bickering lions who sound distressingly like Stallone and Cher. After a three-minute product plug -- sorry outing -- at TGI Fridays with Nick Noltes gorilla James is instructed to make Bibb jealous by taking a co-worker as his guest to the wedding. Even the dumbest animal or audience member would realize that this warm-hearted guest played by the gorgeous Rosario Dawson is a better match for James. But if the animals or James did the movie would be 20 minutes long instead of a punishing 104. With Dawsons help James manages to upstage Bibbs wedding guest an obnoxious ex-boyfriend (former ""Fear Factor"" host Joe Rogan) not to mention the bride and groom at the wedding dinner. At Bibbs insistence he quits his job at the zoo to go to work at his brothers automobile dealership . . . and you can pretty much guess the rest. The cast also includes Ken Jeong -- without whose presence no bad movie this season would be complete -- as a snake expert and Donnie Wahlberg who avoids unemployment as a cruel zookeeper. ""Zookeeper"" barely avoids a zero-star rating because of James. The bulky former star of ""King of Queens"" is impossible to hate no matter how much dumb slapstick he and his stunt double are required to perform. The movie however is very easy to hate. As one of the animals puts it ""Every time we talk to humans it turns out badly."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next The man who would be king of England Read Next The man who would be king of England Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46713 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21188 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17472 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Kevin James right and Jackie Sandler star in Columbia Pictures comedy ""Zookeeper."" Photo Columbia Pictures Zookeeper review Sentiment soothes shrillness 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Zookeeper Comedy. Starring Kevin James Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb. Directed by Frank Coraci. (PG. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As far as complete wastes of time go ""Zookeeper"" is not especially offensive. Yet it is surprising that everything you might expect to be charming in it just isnt - namely all the bits involving animals. After all if just looking at a giraffe or a lion or an elephant is reasonably enriching then how bad could it be to see talking animals and hear celebrity voices coming out of them? But the animal stuff is poorly done. The animals and their voices are mismatched and the movie has so many big names in these animal roles that the script has to go out of its way to give them all something special to do. For the record Adam Sandler is a monkey Sylvester Stallone and Cher are lions Maya Rudolph is a giraffe Nick Nolte is a forlorn gorilla etc. The result is a lot of animal scenes that are shrill and noisy cluttered with sound and too frenetic to be remotely funny. The humans ultimately pick up the slack in this one. Kevin James has the title role as a good-hearted zookeeper who has never gotten over getting dumped by his superficial status-conscious girlfriend (Leslie Bibb). Now five years later he seems to have a shot at winning her back and the animals help by offering mating advice. Rosario Dawson as the zoos veterinarian also lends a hand by posing as his date in order to make the ex jealous. Within definite limits - he is not going to play Macbeth anytime soon - James is quite a decent actor very good at conveying tension and embarrassment in ways that are convincing not just comical. And he is very much keyed into the kindness of this zookeeper which makes him - for all the movies inconsistencies and occasional stupidities - someone to care about particularly as the movie wears on. Thats the other good thing. ""Zookeeper"" unlike 95 percent or more of the movies that go into release actually gets better as it goes along. ""Better"" in this case need not be exaggerated. The movie starts off barely watchable and gradually ends up reasonably engaging. Still improvement is improvement. Director Frank Coraci (""Around the World in 80 Days"" ""Click"") clearly worked with his actors to stay grounded in emotion and not go for the cheap laugh. Bibb as the ex-girlfriend is a nightmare of false values but Bibb never indicates that she knows this. She stays inside the character and allows us to see in. Dawson in the relatively straight role as the woman we keep wanting him to go with has less opportunity for comedy but she does carry a lot of the movies emotion. Just the fact that ""Zookeeper"" has emotion to carry tells you that its got something even if its not enough. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Suddenly he was Americas loser. His puffed-up myopic bravado stood in for a nation whose dreams outstripped its reality. I was hoping James would go on to develop his charismatic fecklessness but Zookeeper (I cant believe Im even writing this) is a dumbed-down Paul Blart. It starts out as a generic talking-animal comedy with James dweebish zookeeper discovering that the caged residents of Bostons Franklin Park Zoo can squabble and wisecrack like the Toy Story playthings gone noisily vaudeville (best voices Adam Sandlers jabbery Borscht Belt monkey and Maya Rudolphs imperious soul-mama giraffe). When he takes the gorilla (Nick Nolte) out for a night at T.G.I. Fridays the film briefly soars. But too much of Zookeeper is devoted to James? lovelorn hero learning to accept Who He Really Is by abandoning his fantasy of marrying an icky ice princess (Leslie Bibb). Its all very ho-hum though James whos like Jason Alexander with a touch of Jeremy Piven is still a schmo you cant help rooting for.

"Movie review Zookeeper - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Movie review Zookeeper Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Theres no ""The"" in the title of the Kevin James comedy ""Zookeeper"" and that lack of a definitive article pretty well encapsulates the generic fat man follies on display here.Shifting James unhip-employee brand from the shopping center (""Paul Blart Mall Cop"") to the zoo might seem like a change of scenery but youve seen this kind of underdog vindication before. The filmmakers in this case five writers (including James) and director Frank Coraci merely added talking animals in much the way ""artificial flavoring"" distinguishes junk foods of negligible culinary value. James titular working man is Griffin Keyes introduced to us by way of the central humiliation of his life a failed proposal of marriage to stuck-up girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). Her instant repulsion at the offer -- the zookeeping thing was always a turnoff it seems -- might make for a cheap laugh but it also signals the personality-blind ridiculousness driving the plot.Five years later Griffin is committed to winning back his heartless ex when working alongside him in animal-loving harmony is Kate a sweet friendly eagle expert who looks like Rosario Dawson. Buying Dawson as a romantic also-ran is about as believable as well the movies central gimmick which is that the animals in Griffins care can talk and decide to break their longstanding no-chitchatting-with-humans code in order to help their hapless master. That theyd rather give romance advice than plea to be freed is for another movie granted.So here we get bears (voiced by Jon Favreau and Faizon Love) offering Griffin alpha-male posture advice the lion (Sylvester Stallone) and lioness (Cher) bickering about courtship rituals in the herd and the monkey (producer Adam Sandler echoing Gilbert Gottfried) saying ""Throw poop at her.""Parents with grade-school boys in tow probably shouldnt fear too much in the suggestive power of celebrity-voiced creatures however. Though the wolf (Bas Rutten) insists Griffin trust in the pheromone-drawing power of a manly stream its a safe bet that if young boys thought relieving themselves in a potted plant -- as Griffin does at a wedding -- would attract girls that behavioral no-no would quickly be off the table.""Zookeeper"" has the territory-marking scent of a franchise product from the Sandler-produced stable pratfalls caricature and aggression which the likeable-enough James isnt as effective at getting laughs with as he is the more recessive aw-shucks moments. While Coraci directed the only remotely charming boy-meets-girl story in the Sandler canon (""The Wedding Singer"") theres nothing sustainable about the love triangle here.More curious is how ineffectual the gabbing menagerie shtick is as if a group of majestic beasts -- which includes a Maya Rudolph-voiced giraffe -- are only interesting when hanging around tossing out one-liners. (A comment on captivity perhaps?)The only real spark from this ""Night at the Museum""-style fantasy comes from the growing friendship between Griffin and Bernie a dejected gorilla growled to life by Nick Nolte and whos kept unfairly isolated due to perceived dangerousness.In a strangely funny product-placement interlude Griffin whisks Bernie away to a TGI Fridays for a night of fried food alcoholic revelry and flirting with the ladies who are told Bernies a guy in a costume.The absurdist glimmer here of man partying with talking animal is one that ""Zookeeper"" could have used more of because the rest of the movie is more of a genre-fortified enclosure than a comic idea that gets to run wild.calendarlatimes.com Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Human Interest Pets Zookeeper (movie) Entertainment Movies Kevin James Weddings Word of Mouth Zookeeper may have been caged too long Movie review Zookeeper Movie review Beats Rhymes amp; Life The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-zookeeper-20110708,0,7319509.story?track=rss",200,zookeeper13,zookeeper,latimes

Its the latest in actor Kevin James increasingly lengthy list of recycled lackluster zero-to-hero comedies that includes such nonclassics as Paul Blart Mall Cop and Hitch and now this uninspired retread of Dr. Dolittle that does very little indeed.James stars as Griffin Keyes the titular animal tender a put-upon schlub who somehow landed beautiful model Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) as a girlfriend. He quickly loses her in the opening scene when in the middle of proposing to her on a beach she reveals her distaste for his career and failure to be the kind of man she wants him to be.Flash-forward five years and Griffin is still working at the zoo. Stephanie re-enters his life just as Griffins brother is about to marry and shes just as inexplicably attracted to him as she was before. But shes waffling between Griffin and her recent ex-boyfriend Gale (Joe Rogan). Griff wants to win her back. When part of that quest involves possibly getting a new job at a car dealership the animals of Franklin Park Zoo reveal their ability to talk and begin coaching Griffin on self-esteem and the finer points of dating (as dictated in the wild). Their hope is that hell stay at the zoo.What little there is beyond the thin and ill-conceived premise is pretty much standard rom-com formula. Griffins blind to the worthwhile woman who truly loves him his co-worker Kate (Rosario Dawson) only realizing his mistakes once hes obtained what he thought he wanted. Then he makes everything right in the last 10 minutes of screen time which culminates in the obligatory mad dash to catch his true love before she leaves town.The gags are mostly scatological in nature or simply cheap pratfalls par for the course these days. Still with a script credited to five people -- rarely a good sign -- one would hope for a few surprises. The talking animals look good on the screen though they are not always seamlessly inserted into some shots. But most of the voices fail to register as distinct characters with the exceptions of Sylvester Stallone as an alpha-male lion Adam Sandler (one of the films producers) as a loudmouthed monkey and Judd Apatow as a neurotic elephant.If anyone stands out in this waste its Nick Nolte as the voice of a depressed cynical gorilla named Bernie who bonds with Griffin over the course of the movie. Bernie has been abused by a zoo staffer (Donnie Wahlberg) an anemic subplot that feels grafted on to pad an already too-long run time.ZookeeperD+ Starring Kevin James Leslie Bibb Rosario Dawson Donnie Wahlberg Joe Rogan and the voices of Nick Nolte Sylvester Stallone Cher Adam Sandler Jon Favreau and Maya Rudolph.

More about Zookeeper >> Kevin James stars in this flat furry farce playing a love dunce devoted to the caged menagerie in his care. (Actually the animals even the predators spend far more time out of their enclosures in this film than they do confined.) As his name tag informs us James is the ""Head Zookeeper"" at Bostons wildlife park. This despite the fact that he seems to have no acquaintance with animal physiology or habits. His primary qualification is that he pampers these creatures outrageously. Thats why when the animals find out he wants to switch careers to please the grasping shrew (Leslie Bibb) hes stupidly hooked on they decide to break their cardinal code and speak to a human. Soon James is saddled with all kinds of inappropriate mating strategies such as marking his territory or walking with his ""pudding cup"" thrust forward. His suddenly odd behavior is alarming his capable coworker (Rosario Dawson). Zookeeper begins with a clever scene - a marriage proposal gone horribly wrong. It goes steadily downhill from there. The plot is a hoary trite series of detours leading to an obvious epiphany James realizes he only has to be himself. Wait theres a second lesson here too Dont let the gorilla drive. The film would be a moth-eaten mess without the wisecracking animals. Not that its funny with them. You get a batch of name actors - Sylvester Stallone Cher Maya Rudolph Jon Favreau - doing criminally cartoonish voices. The worst transgressor is Adam Sandler indulgently vocalizing a Capuchin monkey as a cross between Gilbert Gottfried and Louis Armstrong. If this ploy amuses you youre probably a Barney fan. Although it may represent a career low for Nick Nolte his gravelly delivery of a severely depressed ape is the only bright spot. Zookeeper is suggested only for those who want to watch animals chew hay and scenery at the same time. Contact David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

Marrying the kiddie fantasy of Dr. Dolittle with the man-child goofiness of producer Adam Sandlers oeuvre Frank Coracis drab-looking film charts Boston zoo warden Griffins (James) efforts to woo bitchy former fiancee Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) via the amorous advice of among others a lion (Sylvester Stallone) lioness (Cher) and monkey (a funny-voiced Sandler). That quest involves so many hoary conventions that the story would seem downright parodic if not for its willful dimness. When not smashing into walls and plummeting into pits Griffins heart is torn between materialistic Stephanie and kind co-worker Kate (Rosario Dawson) but the tales true central relationship is between Griffin and morose gorilla Bernie (Nick Nolte). Their mushy bromance--or is it gromance?--involves staring at the stars while lying on top of a van and scaling a bridge during a race-to-the-airport finale though its highlight is an early sequence in which Bernie laments humans penchant for lying and then wonders ""Is T.G.I. Fridays as incredible as it looks?"" Its a sequence of such mind-boggling bizarreness that its unclear if this is the crazy Noltes career apex or nadir.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Zookeeper is multiple movies for the price of one. This makes it the summers best entertainment bargain by weight if not by anything else.Besides being the story of a Franklin Park Zoo attendant (Kevin James) who is unlucky in love ""Zookeeper offers a tiny slice of the new ""Transformers movie courtesy of Ken Jeongs wild-man shtick as the zoos reptile keeper. Its a bigger slice of ""Horrible Bosses thanks to Joe Rogans elbows-out performance as Jamess alpha-male romantic rival. Its the two ""Night at the Museum pictures except here its the zoo inhabitants who talk and make merry when no one is looking. And of course its every Kevin James movie ever made.This means James plays his usual flub-a-dub everyman whos not exactly the sharpest claw on the paw. How dull is that claw? It takes James half the movie to realize Rosario Dawson as a zoo colleague looks like Rosario Dawson. It then takes him nearly the rest of the movie to act on this. Straining credulity is one thing. Straining sanity is another.Dawson walks through ""Zookeeper with charm and aplomb. Presumably she signed on for the money. At least she earned her check. Almost as enjoyable are Sylvester Stallone and Cher who provide the voices of a lion and lioness. Sly and Cher in the flesh are pretty scary these days. Rendered incorporeal they do just fine. The closing credits offer the animals chiming in on Bostons ""More Than a Feeling. Cher definitely still has her pipes.As for other voices the most notable are Adam Sandler whose capuchin monkey wears out his welcome pretty quickly; Maya Rudolph whose jivey giraffe comes perilously close to aural blackface; and Nick Noltes gorilla.What ""Zookeeper really wants to be is a buddy picture with James and Nolte as Butch and Sundance. The movies big set piece is their evening out at a TGI Fridays - a promising idea that is unpromisingly executed. Is it Frank Coracis slack direction or the tonal incoherence that comes from having five writers credited for the screenplay? There is a bigger tonal problem. The talking animals are wildly child-pleasing except that much of their talk concerns matters of animal husbandry. Is there such a thing as a hard PG?The reason the animals let James in on the secret that they can speak is to help him out of a jam. His ex-girlfriend (Leslie Bibb) has turned up and the animals try to coach him back into her affections. You do not want to know about the wolf demonstrating scent-marking.So how Boston is ""Zookeeper? James lives in a three-decker. He and Dawson attend at a wedding reception at Copley Plaza (at which James lip-synchs to a Barry White song the movies single funniest moment). Donnie Wahlberg in the thankless role of a thuggish zoo attendant has the only local accent - which he comes by naturally of course.On the debit side the wonders of CGI make the Boston skyline seem to loom over the zoo. Beacon Street near the State House manages to intersect with the Commonwealth Avenue Mall and it turns out that the quickest route from Back Bay to Logan Airport is by way of the Zakim Bridge.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Zookeeper Kevin James Animal Distraction The star can be funny and endearing but here hes buried under derivative gags and ritual humiliation By Richard Corliss July 07 2011 Share Read Later Sony PicturesKevin James in Zookeeper Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Its probably time to stop fretting about Kevin Jamess movies and to stop hoping theyll get better. After nine seasons of TV stardom on The King of Queens the plus-size comedian made a successful transition to the big screen four summers ago as Adam Sandlers ""wife"" in I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry. The genial James persona -- a fat guy whos not seething with rage no matter how many banana peels Fate strews in his path -- offered a nice change from movie comics whose shtick was being angry (Sandler) manic (Jim Carrey) or sullen (Vince Vaughn). In Paul Blart Mall Cop a surprise hit in early 2009 James proved he could attract audiences on his own; and when he simply let his character endure indignity with a strangely Zen-like calm he could be funny and endearing. Given stronger material he might actually make good movies. The first moments of Zookeeper -- with James as Griffin Keyes a loving friend of wild animals in his job at Bostons Franklin Park Zoo -- suggest that this could be the one. On a tropical beach with Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) the blond dimpled object of his adoration he launches into an obviously well-rehearsed proposal ""Its no secret weve been on a journey an adventure...Will you marry me?"" Her firm ""No"" -- accompanied by a pre-planned breakup speech -- puts a damper on the accoutrements hes arranged the romantic horse ride the mariachi band the fireworks display in heart shapes. They may as well crumble in the sky an objective correlative to Griffins broken spirit and ego. Whoever wrote that sweetly funny opening scene -- the credited scribes are James King of Queens veterans Nick Bakay and Rock Reuben and two other writers Jay Scherick and David Ronn who worked on the Eddie Murphy moviesI Spy and Norbit -- must have been excused from further service for the film soon settles into predictably infantile Sandler territory. Encouraged to pile humiliations on Griffin the writers show him knocked unconscious by running into a metal bar; propel him across a zoo gorge only to have him land splat on a rockface as if in a 127 Hours ordeal; and make him pee publicly on a wolf. (Did the MPAA accidentally leave off the ""13"" from its PG rating? Parents will be challenged to explain the urination scene the size jokes and other penis-related comedy to their kids.) Griffin has a wondrous rapport with the lions and monkeys and bears but goes stammering around pretty women especially when Stephanie returns into his orbit. (He doesnt seem to notice the ardor of Kate the lady zookeeper played by the criminally gorgeous Rosario Dawson.) This cues the movies twin premises that Griffin is too mild-mannered to attract Stephanie and that he takes dating tips from the animals that break their ""code of silence"" by talking to him. In a weird amalgam of two other Eddie Murphy comedies -- The Nutty Professor and Dr. Dolittle -- the zookeeper takes the creatures counsel and transforms himself into an alpha-male boor a character James doesnt have the meanness to inhabit. So James is stuck in routines echoing other movies replaying the Ben-Hur chariot scene as a bike race in Boston traffic; doing a car singalong -- la Waynes Worlds ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" but to Flo Ridas ""Low"" and with a gorilla named Bernie. The occasional opportunity for sharp physical comedy like Griffins and Kates impromptu sash-dance at his brothers wedding falls stunningly flat. And the final chase via truck canoe and gorilla is a case study in climax mismanagement. For the viewer the films only suspense is guessing which celebrities (Sandler Sylvester Stallone Cher and as Bernie Nick Nolte) lent their voices to the animals. Its all mildly deplorable and instantly forgettable. Kevin James remains a potentially appealing movie star -- if only he didnt have to be in Kevin James movies.

By    Alonso Duralde on July 7 2011  1227 pm Follow aduralde Email Print This jumbled fusion of CG talking-animal movie for kiddies and moronic rom-com for undemanding adults winds up being not entirely a fiasco thanks mostly to Nick Nolte ""Zookeeper"" is arguably one of the better products of the Adam Sandler Death of Cinema Fun Factory -- but thats an accomplishment somewhere on par with ""Least Smelly Turd."" Still this jumbled fusion of CG talking-animal movie for kiddies and moronic rom-com for undemanding adults winds up being not entirely a fiasco thanks mostly to the heroic contributions of Nick Nolte (as a gorilla) and Rosario Dawson. Kevin James -- who kind of already made this movie only it was called ""Hitch"" and he was getting romantic advice from Will Smith rather than lions bears and wolves -- plays zookeeper Griffin Keyes whos still smarting over being rejected by Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) five years earlier when he proposed to her on a beach. (""Just ignore them"" he tells her regarding the hired mariachi band and the fireworks as they sadly trudge home on horseback.) Stephanie dumped Griffin because she apparently has some beef with zookeeping and thinks that Griffin somehow isnt living up to his potential. But he clearly loves his work the animals in the picture-perfect Boston zoo where he toils adore him and hes got a chummy friendship with the zoos perky vet Kate (Dawson). Griffin throws a party in the zoo to celebrate the upcoming wedding of his brother Dave (Nat Faxon) where Stephanie shows up and flusters Griffin whos in the middle of giving a speech about love while using a porcupine as a live prop. The animals overhear Griffin and Stephanie talking about each other and they decide to help Griffin win his dream girl. The animals you see can all speak English; theyve just got a code that forbids them from ever revealing that fact to humans. (Which if they could talk themselves out of being slaughtered by poachers or dressed up in tutus at circuses they probably would but never mind that for now.) And so the lions (Sylvester Stallone and Cher) the bears (Faizon Love and Jon Favreau) the monkey (Adam Sandler) the elephant (Judd Apatow) the wolf (UFC fighter Bas Rutten) and the giraffe (Maya Rudolph) talk to each other and eventually to Griffin about what Griffin needs to do to become an alpha. The revelation of animal speech first leads to interminable scenes of Kevin James screaming but eventually it allows Griffin to bond with Bernie (Nolte) the zoos recalcitrant diamondback gorilla. And Nolte pro that he is pours so much into Bernie that it actually makes ""Zookeeper"" feel like a real movie about characters about whom you might actually give a flip. (Even the sequence where Griffin takes Bernie to TGI Fridays plays like a character moment rather than the piece of blatant product placement that it actually is.) Griffins pursuit of Stephanie proves to be one slapstick catastrophe after another but the movies obviously just killing time until it realizes what the audience knew in the first two minutes -- its Kate whos really the right girl for him. I mean hey -- its Rosario Dawson and shes a veterinarian. Whats not to love? Dawson and James create some actual romantic chemistry and they share the films highlight wherein they try to make Stephanie jealous by dancing around Daves wedding on acrobat ribbons which leads to Griffin destroying an ice sculpture and body-checking the bride. Its sort of a commentary on the sad state of family movies that the following even has to be said but ""Zookeeper"" isnt toxic isnt rampantly sexist and doesnt completely bury the audience in bodily functions. And overall it didnt have me longing for the sweet release of death. So by those standards it fares pretty well. If you believe that ""childrens entertainment"" doesnt have to be thoroughly moronic -- in the same way that ""childrens food"" doesnt have to be horsemeat -- you may find this movie somewhat lacking. And who exactly thought that little kids would care about a romantic triangle so utterly artificial and contrived that Katherine Heigl would feel right at home in the middle of it? Conversely why stick a sassy giraffe in the middle of a love story? The uneasy marriage of genres feels like someone wanted to copy the usual Pixar formula -- make movies that children and adults alike can enjoy albeit on different levels -- but wound up with a freakish man-bear-pig instead. Still James is affably likable in that sitcom-star manner that he brings to every movie and every so often ""Zookeeper"" reminds you of the much better film it could conceivably have become. And in a summer when even Pixar has dropped the ball in providing quality entertainment for the whole family that might just be enough for desperate parents. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Zookeeper | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; zookeeper ) Zookeeper (United States 2011) July 07 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Zookeeper is no Mall Cop. The 2009 comedy Paul Blart Mall Cop may have been one of the most unexpectedly pleasant movie-going surprises of the past few years. It was better than it had a right to be and convinced audiences that in addition to front-lining a television show Kevin James could also carry a film on his own using little more than his natural penchant for physical comedy and his easygoing nature. Although James may have faltered in The Dilemma it has taken a train wreck like Zookeeper to bring his motion picture momentum to a halt. A horrifyingly inept comedy this plays to James weaknesses seemingly crafted as a rejected vehicle for Adam Sandler who has his fingerprints all over every frame. In addition to providing voice work for a rude monkey Sandler is a co-producer and one of his handpicked directors Frank Coraci is at the helm. There are few things worse than bad unfunny Sandler projects except perhaps bad unfunny neutered Sandler projects. The family friendly PG-rating (which comes with the territory for James after Paul Blart) reduces the cartoonish humor to a level where even the youngest members of the audience may be unimpressed. (Neither kids nor adults were laughing much at the packed screening I attended.) Theres a Hollywood axiom that the more credited screenwriters a movie has the bigger a mess it is likely to be. This proves true with Zookeeper which boasts five names in that category including James and his King of Queens stalwart Rock Reuben. The story is a mess; subplots blossom and die without point and with little resolution. The main story turns out not to be the talking animals at Massachusetts Franklin Park Zoo but a tired romantic triangle among head zookeeper Griffin Keyes (James); materialistic Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) who rejected his marriage proposal five years previously; and veterinarian Kate (Rosario Dawson) whose inexplicable attraction to Griffin is the only thing keeping her from accepting a job in Nairobi. When an opportunity arises for Griffin to win back Stephanie from her current squeeze the vile Gale (Joe Rogan - yes the Fear Factor host) the animals break their code of silence and begin offering their best bud Griffin advice. He becomes friends with the uncommunicative zoo gorilla and uses tactics prescribed by the bears wolves and lions to embarrass himself on his quest to secure a mate. In the end he figures out that his true love is Kate not Stephanie (this is made so obvious by the clunky screenplay that it cannot be considered a spoiler) and seeks to get things right. James can be a funny guy but the lack of laugh-worthy material in Zookeeper stretches his comedic abilities past the breaking point. There are numerous pratfalls (Griffin smacking his head on a low-hanging metal bar Griffin leaping and missing his landing point Griffin decimating an ice sculpture etc.) but few generate more than a polite obligatory chortle or two. The romantic situation is so painful that every scene involving Griffin and Stephanie is strained and tedious enough to risk causing instant catatonia for some viewers. Those desperately searching for something positive to say about Zookeeper might note that there is evidence of chemistry between James and Rosario Dawson but the filmmakers keep this in check by ensuring the two rarely share the screen (the wedding reception being the only significant exception and perhaps the only worthwhile scene). Zookeepers ""hook"" is supposed to be the speaking animals who treat Griffin like their personal Dr. Doolittle. Its unclear whether hes the only one who can understand them and it really doesnt matter. Some well known actors lend their vocal talents Nick Nolte as the gorilla Sylvester Stallone and Cher as lions Adam Sandler as a monkey Judd Apatow as an elephant and Jon Favreau and Faizon Love as bears. The bad thing about recognizable voices is that they can be distracting and thats the case with Stallone and Nolte. One keeps expecting the lion to growl ""Yo Adrian"" The ""special effects"" employed to have the animals mouths form words might have been state-of-the-art 20 years ago but theyre outdated today and the gorilla looks like a guy in the monkey suit that was abandoned after the 1976 version of King Kong. I guess CGI was too sophisticated for the technical crew. In 2009 Paul Blart was followed to theaters by Observe and Report Jody Hill and Seth Rogens dark R-rated perspective of the mall cop profession. It boggles the mind to consider what Hill and Rogen might do with the zookeeper vocation. Although there is no such project in the works such a movie would almost have to be more enjoyable than the torturous excuse for a family film foisted upon us by James and his cohorts.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Zookeeper an Adam Sandler-produced comedy starring Kevin James takes place in a world where animals unbeknownst to the humans around them can talk. But that isnt the extent of its alternate-universe qualities. Its also a world where the profession of zookeeping is regarded with roughly the same respect extended to telemarketers or drug dealers. James plays the titular zookeeper a kindly spineless fellow whos told by both his successful brother (Nat Faxon) and his materialistic ex-girlfriend (Leslie Bibb) that he could be so much more if hed just let this zookeeping nonsense go and take a job at Faxons luxury-car dealership. Lonely beneath his cheerful exterior James is on the verge of giving up on his zookeeping dream job when the animals unexpectedly start giving him advice on how to win Bibb back in order to keep him happy and keep him in the zookeeping fold. From this point on there are two ways to look at Zookeeper One is as a kiddie comedy in which James takes counsel from a variety of cute animals with CGI-assisted facial expressions and the voices of Sylvester Stallone Cher and Sandler. (Plus theres one unconvincing fake gorilla voiced by Nick Nolte.) The other is as a depiction of one mans descent into madness. And while the former interpretation may be how director Frank Coraci and the collective of credited screenwriters intended the movie to be seen the other reading is no less plausible. In one scene James listens to a wolf tell him to mark his territory with urine. Moments later hes peeing in a fancy restaurants potted plant. Perhaps he decided that in a world in which wolves give advice to humans none of the usual rules apply. As a study in insanity Zookeeper is mildly interesting. But as a kiddie comedy its something to watch only once the little ones have worn out their Dr. Doolittle DVD--maybe even their Dr. Doolittle 2 DVD for that matter. James makes for a bland lead and his furry co-stars arent much more compelling. Nobody expects much nuance from talking animals but some of the performances here--Sandlers capuchin and Maya Rudolphs giraffe serving as exhibits A and B--illustrate why voiceover work is sometimes best left to voiceover artists. Rosario Dawson is on hand as the theoretically unglamorous overlooked dream girl right under James nose. And because its a comedy released after 2007 Ken Jeong has a small role. It is the first film however in which he costars with a sass-talking crow voiced by Jim Breuer.

One would think a movie about talking animals aimed primarily at children would be difficult to screw up especially with Kevin James coming off a major hit in that demo with ""Paul Blart Mall Cop."" So ""Zookeeper"" probably is commercially bulletproof despite offering barely enough comedy to populate a three-minute trailer. Ultimately its a marketing pitch in search of a movie that proves punishingly flat with even the slapstick so sparsely delivered as to replicate a long slog through the zoo surrounded by fidgety kids on a suffocating summers day. Adam Sandlers talking monkey counsels James zookeeper Griffin to fling poop at a problem and as producers of this project (with James doubling as star and one of the five writers) thats essentially what theyve done. Griffin is introduced as he lavishly proposes to his girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) who crushes him by rejecting the overture saying that marrying a zookeeper isnt what she envisioned. Flash ahead five years and Griffin is still at the zoo and thrown for a loop when Stephanie appears at an engagement party for Griffins brother. Her return also alarms the animals who love the big lug and hate the thought of losing him. So they band together to aid him in winning her back even if that results in breaking ""the code"" barring them from revealing their ability to speak to humans. Directed by Frank Coraci (a veteran of Sandler vehicles ""The Waterboy"" ""Click"" and ""The Wedding Singer"") the conceit creates an excuse to cast a lot of celebrity voices as the animals including Sylvester Stallone and Cher as the lion and lioness Sandler as the Borscht Belt capuchin and Nick Nolte as a taciturn gorilla. Once theyve been outed for their vocal abilities though the movie pretty much just lies there unable to exploit the idea. The sequences with animals coaching Griffin on how to impress Stephanie rarely pop and tend to be of the peeing-to-mark-territory variety. The only thing that fleetingly perks up the movie is Noltes great ape which likely proves most valuable in creating a terrific product-placement opportunity with T.G.I. Fridays. On the downside Griffin exhibits more chemistry with the simian than with either Bibb or Rosario Dawson (as a patient veterinarian he enlists to make Stephanie jealous). Then again the fact that James character is presented with a choice between Bibb and Dawson is far less plausible than zoo denizens dispensing romantic advice. Technically the movie does a credible job anthropomorphizing the animals but its nothing audiences havent seen a thousand times before in movies and especially commercials. Nor does it help that most of the people - including Joe Rogan as a romantic rival and Ken Jeong as a randy reptile expert - are even more cartoonish than the cage-dwellers. Somewhat ironically the crux of the story hinges on Griffin failing (in the eyes of his ex anyway) to fulfill his potential and based on James career arc theres something to that. Having demonstrated himself to be a more adept actor than many standups who make the transition to TV and movies James has settled into a niche as an amiable pratfalling clown in fare aimed at young kids and adults who find Pixar and DreamWorks animated fare too intellectually demanding. It might be lucrative but thats hardly living up to anybodys promise man or beast.

Daily Edition Login to download Zookeeper Film Review 900 AM PDT 7/7/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Columbia Pictures Beastly comedy for the lowest of brow. TWITTER Frank Coracis inane Kevin James vehicle covets the ""Night at the Museum"" audience with disappointing results. Zookeeper smells like the monkey house before cleaning time. All of a piece in that its dreadful in every respect this archly mirthless comedy about a sad sack Dr. Dolittle plainly covets the Night at the Museum audience keen for more institutional after hours fantasy. But the five screenwriters including star Kevin James go far astray by spending inordinate time on the tubby heros preposterous involvement with two hotties which will be of little interest anyway to tykes who just want to see the talking animals. Current dearth of family-style comedies could play to Sonys commercial advantage but notable shortage of laughs suggests it wont do the same sustained business of James previous common man comedy Paul Blart Mall Cop. Embarrassingly rejected by Hottie No. 1 Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) after an elaborate marriage proposal earnest schmo Griffin Keyes (James) retreats to his job at Bostons (real) Franklin Park Zoo where the animals yack with each other but observe a code of not speaking to humans. But after a lion lets the cat out of the bag the critters all start gabbing with Griffin but only with him because they feel hes the only one who respects them and treats them right. Unfortunately the animals chatter is just as inane as that of any humans in the vicinity and special effort has clearly been expended by a semi-all-star voice cast to make sure some of them are truly unpleasant to listen to with Maya Rudolphs giraffe and Adam Sandlers monkey being the vocal equivalent of fingernails on a chalkboard. Before long Griffin develops a special friendship with a morose gorilla (voiced more tolerably by Nick Nolte) who in some wannabe laff-riot moments leaves the reservation with Griffin for some dinner and dancing (hes able to get away with the ruse because he talks convincing all hes a man in a suit). Unfortunately Stephanie reenters the picture and Griffin is stupid enough to once again compete for the shallow blondes attention. His ploy is for her to see him in the company of fellow zoo worker Kate (Rosario Dawson) whom he somehow doesnt realize is Hottie No. 2 in his life until she dons a sharp outfit for their date at the wedding party of Griffins brother (Nat Faxon) to whom he bears absolutely no resemblance. Even then Griffin ditches the woman who clearly likes him for the nitwitted Stephanie whose abysmal taste in men is confirmed by her relationship with the vainly self-centered Gale (Joe Rogan). All this has the only slightest of relevance to Griffins attachment to the animals which is not convincing anyway due to the crassness of most of their exchanges. The animatronic mouth movements and expressions are more credible than those of old Mr. Ed to be sure but the whole undertaking feels so calculated and insincere that any laughs catch in the throat. The films 103 minutes should have been 83 if that. James Griffin appears far too homely and lacking in savoir faire for the female company he keeps and when he goes all slick and cocky in the late-going to impress Stephanie the film reaches the dismal depths of its own absurdity. Although one would never have expected to find her in a film like this Dawson by dint of enthusiasm is the only actor who rises above the material with her dignity intact. Ken Jeong keeps the innuendo coming as a randy zoo worker but he doesnt seem to be only co-star of The Hangover Part 2 on hand; if the monkey here isnt the very same from that film its a very close relative.

Zookeeper Bad Director Frank Coraci. Cast Kevin James Rosario Dawson Leslie Bibb. Rating PG for some rude and suggestive humor and language. This weeks new movie releases Films with animal stars Yep. Hes right. Because everything in director Frank Coracis film about a lovelorn zookeeper for whom the animals feel so sorry that they break their code of silence around humans to offer romantic advice is predictable - including no doubt your preconceived notions of the movies quality. Its stupid then it veers toward the absurd but with James at its center it remains sort of sweet throughout. You cant hate James or the movie; both are just sort of dopey but well-meaning. On the other hand neither is much to write home about. Unless you find a scene in which a wolf urinates on a tree and James follows suit to be funny. Then youre in luck. James plays Griffin Keyes and the film opens with what is probably its best scene Griffin and his girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) on horseback on a beach. An elaborate proposal ends in disaster - Stephanie doesnt like that he is ""just"" a zookeeper. Five years pass and Griffin has been promoted to lead zookeeper. He seems happy with his lot but during a party at the zoo to celebrate his brothers wedding he spots Stephanie in the crowd and is instantly flummoxed. Hes still got a thing for her obviously and she mentions in front of the animals that hes cute and has so much potential. Meanwhile he works alongside Kate (Rosario Dawson) a veterinarian who likes Griffin for who he is not for who she thinks he should or could be. Hmm. Wonder where this is leading? And then were let in on the secret Animals can talk. They love Griffin because he respects them and takes good care of them. The voice talent assembled for the animals is impressive Nick Nolte as Bernie a gorilla; Adam Sandler (a producer of the film) as Donald a monkey; Sylvester Stallone as Joe a lion; Cher as Janet his mate; uber producer Judd Apatow as Barry an elephant; Jon Favreau as Jerome a bear; and Maya Rudolph as Mollie a giraffe. At first they try to nudge Griffin in the right direction without talking but it proves fruitless. They must break the code. Griffin is suitably freaked out as first but before long is chatting freely with the animals. (There is a weird subplot with Bernie the gorilla and an abusive zookeeper played by Donnie Wahlberg tossed in that goes nowhere.) Each animal has ideas about how to win back Stephanie. Most fail spectacularly (see urinating on tree above or Sandlers Donald encouraging Griffin to ""throw poop at her""). Griffins big chance revolves around his brothers wedding where he can try to win Stephanie back from another ex-boyfriend (an obnoxious Joe Rogan). Naturally Kate is willing to go as Griffins date to help. The implausible leads to the ridiculous with Griffin becoming a successful luxury-car salesman for a time. But its not his true nature and who knows more about that than animals? Happily ever-afters abound which is no surprise. Then again with ""Zookeeper"" nothing is.
