Comments Be Cool I barely remember Get Shorty (1995) in which Miami loan shark Chili Palmer (John Travolta) breaks into the criminal side of the movie business courtesy of Elmore Leonard but its got to be better than this dumbass sequel that has him crashing the LA music scene. Travoltas teamed up with an equally out of place Uma Thurman and theyre the only ones the movie doesnt ridicule. Director F. Gary Gray doesnt have a clue about how to film this couple dancing and Peter Steinfelds crude script confuses character with shtick while racing us through a story where loyalties and motivations turn on a dime. I was really glad when it was over. With Vince Vaughn Cedric the Entertainer Andre Benjamin Steven Tyler Christina Milian Harvey Keitel Danny DeVito and an uncredited James Woods. PG-13 113 min.

Loan shark-turned-film producer Chili Palmer (John Travolta) is tiring of Hollywoods endless desire for sequels (oh the irony) and considering his retirement from the movies. After his old music-biz buddy Tommy (James Woods) is gunned down by a toupee-wearing Russian mobster Chili embarks on a career in music management taking on up-and-coming songstress Linda Moon (Christina Milian). Problem is Moon already has a manager Raji (Vince Vaughn) a white man with black pretensions and a gay wannabe actor as his hired muscle (The Rock). Soon Chilis mixing it with the Russian mafia three Hummers full of gangsta rappers and Harvey Keitels industry heavyweight and finding his new racket has even more sharks in it than Hollywood. Uma Thurman slinks by as Tommys lithe tanned widow a former laundry girl to Aerosmith who hooks him up with Steve Tyler in an uncomfortable cameo. Tyler suggests that Moon perform with the band at the Hollywood Bowl and - hey presto - a star is born.Whereas Get Shorty fizzed and crackled faithfully serving Leonards pulp creations as well as offering up an efficient if none-too-biting swipe at Tinseltown Be Cool registers as neither satire nor comedy. Grays direction is anonymous Peter Steinfelds script toothless and Travolta fails to evoke any of Chilis former laid-back charm. Only OutKasts Andre 3000 emerges with dignity his itchy-trigger-fingered gangsta Dabu deserving of a movie of his own and a far better one than this sorry self-referential affair.

"Be Cool | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; be-cool ) Be Cool (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Be Cool the belated sequel to 1995s Get Shorty has moments when we think its going to work. It occasionally tantalizes with witty dialogue and sharp supporting performances. Alas those are only teases - the film is priming us for something that never happens. Be Cool lacks both a focus and an edge making it an amorphous mess. Its not as ugly as some of the films I have endured of late but thats damning with faint praise. Most disappointed will be fans of the first movie who are left with something that is less a sequel and more an afterthought. The problem with Be Cool is that it doesnt tell much of a story - or at least not one thats interesting or compelling. In the wake of his first successful film production Get Lost Chili Palmer (John Travolta) became a Hollywood player. But he has lost his interest in cinema and now wants to move into music. To that end he champions a young singer Linda Moon (Christina Milian) and uses his friendship with the recently-widowed owner of a recording company Edie Athens (Uma Thurman) to get Linda studio time. Complications arise however when music mogul Sin LaSalle (Cedric the Entertainer) demands payment in full of the 300000 owed to him by Edies company - money she doesnt have. In addition Chili finds his life in danger from two different directions. The Russian mob wants him dead because he can identify one of their hit men. And the sleazy managers holding Lindas contract Nick Carr (Harvey Keitel) and his bozo partner Raji (Vince Vaughn) have decided to call in a professional. All of this culminates in a series of double-crosses and a Mexican standoff that should have been a lot more entertaining than it is. Be Cool is a Pulp Fiction reunion movie. The cast features John Travolta (reprising the role he played in Get Shorty) Uma Thurman (as his new business partner/love interest) and Harvey Keitel (as a lowlife). Theres even a dance scene featuring Travolta and Thurman. Unfortunately thats where similarities between this film and Tarantinos iconic 90s film end. Its clear that director F. Gary Gray wants Be Cool to occupy Pulp Fictions orbit but it lacks the requisite energy. And while some of the dialogue is clever it doesnt crackle the way Tarantinos does. A Samuel L. Jackson-like monologue delivered by Cedric the Entertainer lacks sizzle. Travolta oozes attitude but that kind of portrayal is double-edged sword. Chili is almost too cool to be real. In Get Shorty he gained our sympathy. Here theres nothing beneath the frosty surface. This isnt a character; its an avatar. And theres never any sense of danger. Chili is so cool were certain hell find a way out of even the stickiest situation. And to be frank none of the films circumstances are all that sticky. The best thing about Be Cool is a trio of supporting performers. Singer/actress Christina Milian impresses with both her vocals and her acting as Linda Moon. Theres a sweetness and likeability evident in her performance. Cedric the Entertainer successfully mixes comedy with menace in a part that redeems his recent appearance in Man of the House. And The Rock is hilarious as a gay burly bodyguard. Its interesting to note that this is the week when both of the Schwarzenegger successors The Rock and Vin Diesel dabble in comedy. While few would argue that Diesel is overall the more capable actor The Rock wins this battle in a smack-down. Be Cool contains enough moments to keep it from becoming a train wreck although most of those are short-lived. My favorite of these occurs early in the movie. Chili is giving a discourse about his disenchantment with the movie industry. He ends by saying that a film can only use the ""f-word"" once and get a PG-13 rating. He then uses the ""f-word"" and its the only time it is heard during Be Cools 118-minute running time. Check out what the MPAA gave this movie. Not counting Travolta most of the Get Shorty talent both behind-the-scenes and in front of the camera gave Be Cool a pass (although Danny DeVito whose company produced both films has a cameo). While I wouldnt call the names on the Be Cool credit list to be inferior their combined effort has produced a lesser product. Get Shorty represents a rare adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel that works. However with the release of Be Cool Leonard returns to the rank of authors whose stories are better experienced on the written page than in a movie theater. Be Cool (United States 2005) Director F.

"Be Cool Lukewarm With a Touch of Chili washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Be Cool Lukewarm With a Touch of Chili Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 4 2005 Is the single idea in ""Be Cool"" enough to sustain the otherwise running-on-empty thing over a full hour and three quarters? Just barely. That idea -- cynical as the devils bile -- is that a mafiosos hard-bought street wisdom and predatory instincts prepare him perfectly for a career in show biz. It plays on the widely held suspicion that show biz is organized crime except its not as well organized. John Travolta makes a pretty good ex-mob Shylock amiable but unbudgeable. His thing is cool. He is always cool. He doesnt ruffle or rattle swallow spit break eye contact lick his lips blush or flush or any other signals of weakness. He lights a cigarette to show off his tremble-free hands. No matter the circumstances -- whether youre holding a gun a baseball bat or an A-List stars contract -- you wont top him because its like negotiating with an ice cube. He just lets you have both baby blues full bore with a whisper of a smile playing across his long face and he waits on -- he dares -- your move while communicating that your move just wont be good enough. And it never is. This is a sequel to 1995s ""Get Shorty"" which introduced Travoltas Daddy Cool of a hustler name of Palmer Chili Palmer who slithered sweatlessly through Hollywood learning fast unblinking like a snake and quicker than you can say ""I loved it"" and ""The check is in the mail"" becoming a player. It wasnt a classic like ""What Makes Sammy Run"" but more of a ""Look at wha happened to Vinnie Barbarino"" kind of enterprise guided by a black-humor specialist named Barry Sonnenfeld whod made the Addams Family films as well as ""Men in Black."" This follow-up also based on an Elmore Leonard novel finds Chili having made so much dough in pictures that hes now just in it for the giggles. What makes him giggle this time is singer Linda Moon (Christina Milian who seems like Janet Jackson on caffeine) in whom he Believes and of whom he decides to make a star. Unfortunately this obligates him to move laterally into the music business now fully captured by rap culture. But Chilis sang-froid is just as important here as he plots Lindas rise through a number of complexities. These include an unwise iron-clad contract with a low-rent producer (Harvey Keitel) the distress of a failing label headed by the widow of a friend (Uma Thurman too cool for ""Be Cool""). But the worst ordeal may be an extended face-to-face with Steven Tyler of Aerosmith who proves that Liv got all the looks and that cosmetic dentistry may not be the answer its thought to be. (His choppers look like porcelain tombstones on the march. Ew.) Then theres an incomprehensible subplot about a mob of violent Russian pawnbrokers -- it seems to have been left over from whatever was playing last week -- and finally an evocation of hip-hop business practices that is meant to be funny but if the director were white -- F. Gary Gray is not -- would be called racist. Its kind of -- hmmmm less than good a little better than not bad almost all right mediocre without being grating sort of in the C-minus-to-C-minus-minus range. All the plots are sloppily squished together and unified only by Travolta oozing charm gumption and ruthlessness as he cakewalks through the whole thing sublimely confident. The showiest role is played by Vince Vaughn as a white record producer who wants to cross the color line and styles himself too loudly too lamely as an African American. Again the racial stereotyping leaves me extremely uneasy particularly as all the African Americans led by Cedric the Entertainer are just as broadly imagined as gun-toting jewelry-laden droopy-drawered finger-jivin muscle-flexin ET-lookin mooks. Cedric as a P. Diddy-class entrepreneur is a little classier but given a choice he pulls out a chromed jeweled .357 and holds it sideways as he makes his point in a business negotiation. Then theres the Rock. Not a good career move. He plays a muscle-bound gay actor part enforcer and part star wannabe inflamed with the shallowest kind of ambition (that is vanity) and the brightest eyes. Again the slight swish and the over-empathetic eyes are stereotype. I suppose the gentleman who has proven quite an amusing screen presence in his own brand of low action-farce can be forgiven for wanting to act in the worst possible way in the best possible project. This seems however more likely to retard than advance his aspirations toward the A-list although a scene where he re-creates a classic monologue from screen history -- 2000s ""Bring It On"" -- is passably funny. Whos going to put a Travolta and a Thurman in a picture and not let them dance? Certainly not Gray who throws them together as business partners then lovers and finally dancers and both move -- as they did in the infinitely superior ""Pulp Fiction"" -- superbly if the number doesnt quite smoke in the way ""Pulps"" permutation did. Be Cool (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence and sexual innuendo.

Photo by Peter Iovino A mover and shaker makes his way into the music biz -- and onto the dance floor 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Be Cool Action comedy. Starring John Travolta Uma Thurman Harvey Keitel and VinceVaughn. Directed by F. Gary Gray. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Be Cool"" the sequel to ""Get Shorty"" is almost two hours of appealing nonsense about competing gangs and factions warring to control the destiny of a promising young singer. Its instantly forgettable but smooth fun most of the way with John Travolta reprising his role as the impossibly cool Chili Palmer a loan shark-turned-movie producer. Based on the novel by Elmore Leonard the sequel picks up Chilis story 10 years later. Chili is still unflappable still has a killer stare and still has a way of making ridiculously sensitive insights into people that fill them with awe at his perceptiveness. On a Los Angeles street he witnesses the gangland-style murder of a record producer (James Woods) and soon gets the idea to get into the music business himself. ""Be Cool"" is Leonards music industry satire and like his satire of the picture business in ""Get Shorty"" it doesnt cut too deep but its amusing. Things get moving when Chili goes into a nightclub and sees a talented young singer named Linda Moon performing as part of a trio. When he talks to her and finds out that shes tied by a long-term contract to a parasitical manager (Harvey Keitel) his witless assistant (Vince Vaughn) and a gay henchman (The Rock) Chili decides on the spot to manage the girl himself. In a story that carts on a host of flamboyant characters all doing extreme things Linda is an important role the movies fixed center around which everything swirls. Her talent is the one thing everyone can recognize and everyone can value -- including the audience thanks to Christina Milians fine singing and her aura of self-assurance. She seems like a star in the making. ""Be Cool"" reunites the ""Pulp Fiction"" team of Travolta and Uma Thurman who plays the owner of a floundering record label. They have a nice ease with each other and its good to see Thurman smiling again after all that brutal combat in the ""Kill Bill"" movies. Just as ""Pulp Fiction"" referenced ""Saturday Night Fever"" by having Travolta return to the dance floor the makers of ""Be Cool"" cant resist referencing ""Pulp Fiction"" by having Thurman and Travolta dance together again. But the scene just lies there and its unlikely that another movie will ever reference the dance in ""Be Cool."" Lets hope. Yet its a curious thing F. Gary Gray has two seemingly cant-miss musical set-pieces in ""Be Cool"" and he blows both of them. In the case of the Thurman-Travolta dance he has Travolta in black and Thurman in white on a dark dance floor so we cant see Travolta who is really the one the audience wants to look at. Later Chili gets his protege a duet with Steven Tyler at an Aerosmith concert. The duet is intended to be the occasion by which Lindas innate superstardom is revealed. But Tyler hogs the vocals and when they sing together the mix favors Tyler not Milian. Its supposed to be her moment but instead shes just standing there. Gray has better luck getting the comedy over. The story is an appealing mess about the competing interests of Chili the producer played by Keitel a posse of gangsta rappers headed by a rival producer (Cedric the Entertainer) and of course the Russian mafia -- cant leave them out. The characters are colorful if sometimes forced The gay bodyguard who dreams of becoming an actor is a little too silly to be true but The Rock finds some laughs there. The late Robert Pastorelli who died shortly after filming brings an uncompromised bitterness to his role as a hit man. He is so nasty and sour that he becomes quite funny. Travoltas natural air of inner peace goodwill and total mischief -- not the usual combination -- make him an ideal Chili. The role calls from him many of the things audiences like about Travolta. He might want to re- think the smoking however next time he has to play a cool guy. Travolta is now at the age where we dont look at Chili and think the smoking is cool. Rather we worry a little about his health. -- Advisory Gangland violence presented as a joke.

Directed by F. Gary Gray from a screenplay by Peter Steinfeld based on the novel by Elmore Leonard. 115 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence sensuality and language including sexual references. Several theaters. Some very good movies have been made from the works of writer Elmore Leonard such as ""Out of Sight"" and ""Get Shorty"" both adapted by screenwriter Scott Frank. ""Be Cool"" the sequel to ""Get Shorty"" based on the 1999 Leonard book of the same name and adapted by Peter Steinfeld (""Analyze That"") is not one of them. Directed by F. Gary Gray (""The Italian Job"") ""Be Cool"" is a movie that really wants to be a music video. Unfortunately it keeps turning into one as if the director had wandered off for a cup of coffee leaving the movie to its own devices. Chili Palmer (John Travolta) the gangster-turned-film-producer in ""Get Shorty"" here stumbles into the music business through some plot machinations involving a drive-by shooting a hot widow/record executive (Uma Thurman looking like she could use some sunscreen) and an up-and-coming star (newcomer Christina Milian). Like ""Get Shorty"" the film is packed full of oddball characters some of whom are amusing Cedric the Entertainer as an overeducated music producer trying too hard to be street; Harvey Keitel as the cranky head of a management company; The Rock as a bodyguard whos not so tough. (Blink and youll miss Danny DeVito returning as diminutive movie star Martin Weir.) Travolta and Thurman have a bit of chemistry but theyre taking it easy turning in performances so laid-back the characters rarely emerge. And Milian is problematic Shes certainly lovely and a competent singer but the plot focuses around her being The Next Big Thing when she really seems interchangeable with any of those young women who wear too much eyeshadow on ""American Idol."" The film frequently stops to worship her as she sings; and she doesnt seem distinctive enough to justify the star treatment. Theyre all stranded in a screenplay that never congeals shifting from character to character while trying desperately to find some traction. ""Be Cool"" is very self-conscious full of jokes about itself that are too arch to be funny Travolta comments on the lameness of sequels; Steven Tyler (of Aerosmith) in a cameo role notes that ""Im not one of those singers who shows up in movies.""And the worst offender is the much-hyped dance scene with Travolta and Thurman in desperate homage to their famous boogie in ""Pulp Fiction."" Yes theyve danced together before but its not good filmmaking to make them do it again unless theres a reason for it or unless its done so stylishly that it creates its own excuse. Here they slouch around the floor to some forgettable dance track and theres nothing remotely interesting about it. Lightning rarely strikes in the same place twice and certainly not here. ""Be Cool"" keeps wandering off on tangents and after a while its audience does too You find yourself focusing on the interesting way that gravity is affecting Tylers mouth (his famous lips are headed south like wayward explorers) or the fact that Keitel looks like he could be Sean Penns dad. Wouldnt it be fun to see the two of them as some sort of father-son law-enforcement duo running around defending Jude Law from Oscar-night abuse?

"Be Cool A Chilly Reception washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On On Screen Be Cool A Chilly Reception Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 4 2005 ""BE COOL"" which marks the return of John Travolta as lovable loan shark Chili Palmer is perfect testament to what Hollywood does best turn entertaining originals into dull sausage meat. Everything that was enjoyable funny and edgy about the 1995 film ""Get Shorty"" has been rehashed and reshaped into an overwrought insipid wiener. Heres one movie you can truly call a chili dog. Soak it in ketchup. Drown it in mustard. But dont wait for the taste to break through the chemically treated sweetness. Where there was effortless cool in the first movie there is nothing but manufactured posing here. And Travolta who enlivened ""Get Shorty"" with his casual swagger seems to have Madame Tussauded into a stiff artificial figure with a pancake-makeup tan sheeny hair and a performance that seems to come from a prerecorded voice box. A Ken doll watching him would turn its plastic head away. The story is (and never did a sequel not starring Sylvester Stallone or Will Smith feel less like a story) Chili has decided that filmmaking (the business he used to be in) has become too corporate. (Watch this movie and youll agree wholeheartedly.) He sees possibilities as a king (or queen) maker in the world of music. That opportunity comes when he hears the Ramp;B pipes of Linda Moon (Christina Milian) a great singer whos in contract hell with music manager Raji (Vince Vaughn). Teaming with record label owner Edie Athens (Uma Thurman) he unilaterally declares Lindas contract broken with Raji and his partner (a disappointingly wan Harvey Keitel). Thats where the trouble starts. Also in this messy mix Sin LaSalle (an occasionally amusing Cedric the Entertainer) another music producer attended by legions of gangstas who claims Edie owes him money; and a collection of Russian pawn-shop gangsters who simply crowd an already overburdened convoluted movie. The movie amounts to character playoffs among all these parties. Some of those encounters are funny. More arent. And all of it feels artificial Sins gangstas hesitate to shoot Chili because of his supposed intimidating presence but they only do so because the script orders them. Thurman warms to him only because shes supposed to. When these two pucker up for a kiss you almost wince with embarrassment. ""Dont bother"" you want to yell. ""No ones buying it."" Screenwriter Peter Steinfeld (who penned the appalling ""Drowning Mona"" and the sausage-linked ""Analyze That"") and F. Gary Gray (whose best efforts have been the Ice Cube comedy ""Friday"" and ""The Italian Job"" remake) have been contracted to repackage rather than re-evoke. And they can hardly take credit for the movies only bursts of life -- coming from Vaughn and the Rock as Rajis supple Afro-headed gay bodyguard Elliot. As Raji Vaughns a shady Vanilla Ice type who loves the color red and thinks he can talk black. When hes on screen you forget Travoltas even in the movie. ""Stop hatin"" Raji tells the infuriated Elliot at one point. ""Start participatin."" The Rock doesnt lampoon Elliots homosexuality he simply exults in the endearing disconnect between his enormous physicality and his stunning softness. Heaven forbid this movie becomes successful enough to make another sausage. But if that does happen the least the studio can do is build the new one around Raji and Elliot and call it ""Be Done.""

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Gary Gray; Author Scott Frank Peter Steinfeld; Release Date Wide 03/04/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 120; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor MGM Posted March 2 2005 -- 1200 AM EST Prevailed upon back in the day to explain rhythm the legendary jazzman Thomas ""Fats"" Waller is reputed to have said ""Lady if you got to ask you aint got it."" I offer this great moment in musicology in an attempt to distinguish between whats hip and what aint in Be Cool a winded hardworking sequel to Barry Sonnenfelds nifty no-sweat 1995 comedy Get Shorty. That earlier all-star tap dance on the fault line between low-life crime and high-concept Hollywood youll recall was a post?Pulp Fiction career gift to John Travolta and he took full advantage of the role of swingin shylock Chili Palmer the literary creation of L.A.-steeped genre master Elmore Leonard (via a cool screenplay by Scott Frank). Back then Chili was a mobster?turned?movie mogul with an instinct for both rackets. Now hes getting into L.A.s dog-eat-dog music biz. But its been a decade baby and times -- not to mention the measure of how hard a studio movies gotta work to wow the room and earn back the above-the-line expenditure -- have changed. Within the first few minutes Chili (Travolta again his tempo of laid-back street-smart savoir faire now a strangely charming anachronism) is engaged in a smirky rib-nudger of a conversation about the tackiness of making sequels with a soon-to-be-offed semi-sleazeball record producer named Tommy Athens (James Woods). And see there -- right there -- is where Be Cool does not live up to the temperature of its title. Sequels get it? We know this new brand-name-heavy movie is a sequel; Travolta and Woods know that Chili and Tommy are characters in a sequel; we know that Travolta and Woods know that Chili and Tommy are in a sequel; and so on...right down the rabbit hole of self-congratulation and meta meaninglessness wherein one arrives at Oceans Thirteen. The hell of it is Be Cool is tepid entertainment that could be cool if it spent less time entertaining us as if we were demanding a definition of rhythm This is a comedy that glorifies the ineffable ""it"" quality of those in the know yet relies on brand-name cultural identifiers (Charlie Rose the Viper Room American Beauty) and overexertions from its celebrity cast to drive home the joke that Chilis new racket makes use of old instincts. Mobs movies music -- Chilis the dude updated to the dawg. On the plus side the vibe between Travolta as Chili and Uma Thurman as Tommys luscious widow Edie is as splendiferous as it was when the two gleaming stars boogied for Quentin Tarantino 11 years ago. Edie a dishy blonde with an ear for talent is the reason Chili gets mixed up in the music scene at all when he agrees to help her straighten out a business mess left behind by her dead husband involving Russian mobsters and other assorted slime including Harvey Keitel. Theres also a wall of gangsta rappers in her way fronted by a thug-life producer (Cedric the Entertainer full of gusto) with hapless backup from a trigger-happy lieutenant played with breakout charm by OutKasts Andre Benjamin. Edies discovery Linda Moon (Christina Milian) is no great shakes a petite song-belter from the American Idol school of generic vocal fluttering and butt twitching. But Chilis effect on Edie is a treat culminating in a Pulp Fiction dance-floor reprise this time in a sexier Brazilian mode. It works. (Thurman still emits the glow of her Kill Bill triumphs and she carries herself with joy.) On the other side lie such hit-or-miss creations as Vince Vaughns Raji (real name Roger Lowenthal) a white music mini-mogul with hip-hop threads and a loonlike giggle whos only slightly more clued in than Ali G and The Rock as Elliot Rajis much-baited gay bodyguard who really wants to be an actor. The misses have less to do with the talents of Vaughn (a riot a glorious goofball) or The Rock (who appears to be a charming man) than with the clod-footedness of the characters apparently devised in Peter Steinfelds script primarily to amuse the hipster cast. Be Cool is directed by F. Gary Gray who for my money can still dine out on the helium hilarity of his feature debut Friday. But he appears to be stumped by what to do with all the hepcats milling around. ""He just does the one eyebrow"" someone says of Elliot a cue for The Rock to do ""the one eyebrow"" so we can remember Hey its The Rock. But by now the trick is only lukewarm.
