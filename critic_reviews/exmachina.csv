Entertainment The Creepy-Sexy Sci-Fi Film Youve Been Waiting For Oscar Isaac Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander star in Ex Machina an unsettling and satisfyingly smart drama about artificial intelligence. Lets just say Its no Chappie. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Alicia Vikander in Ex Machina Universal Pictures International ID 5422118 How can you tell if a computer can think -- not just pull from a programmed set of responses or rely on predictive algorithms but actually make its own mental leaps and connections and perhaps have a sense of self? Its a thorny thing to suss out intelligence especially when you get into questions of what ""intelligence"" means or the fact that were still trying to understand how our own brains function. You might code an AI from scratch and literally crawl inside its workings but theres no easy way to evaluate how well its man-made mind performs from within. Computer science pioneer Alan Turing whose life was recently pummeled into a biopic-appropriate shape for the Oscar-nominated movie The Imitation Game figured the best we could do is to go by external feedback. If an AI could pass for a person with all of the obvious and ineffable cues by which we recognize and evaluate another human then how could it not be seen as having a consciousness? Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) the hero of novelist and screenwriter Alex Garlands cerebral crystalline sci-fi directorial debut Ex Machina is tasked with taking part in an unconventional Turing test. A programmer at BlueBook an internet search giant that doesnt seem all that concerned with issues of good and evil Caleb wins an employee raffle and is spirited away to a high-tech bunker on a remote but beautiful compound thats the home of his boss Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). Calebs test subject is Ava (Alicia Vikander) and the catch is theres no doubt shes a robot -- a stunning one delicately constructed out of transparent panels and glowing circuitry crowned with an expressively pretty face. What Caleb has to figure out is if shes something more. ID 5422823 A24 A24 A24 ID 5428305 Ex Machina is the kind of heady sci-fi movie thats gotten eclipsed within the genre by space operas and shoot-em-ups -- a talky thriller about big ideas it has the aura of a futuristic fairy tale one in which its hard to tell who the villain is. The most obvious candidate is Nathan the brilliant bristly CEO who spends his days working on his inventions and his nights getting plastered and who seems to be harboring all sorts of hidden agendas. Nathans a very contemporary type of tech geek -- a swaggering brogrammer of malleable morality in wifebeaters and a shaved head who impatiently tells a shell-shocked Caleb ""Youre freaked out to be meeting me to be having this conversation in this room in this moment. Can we just get past that -- the whole employer-employee thing?"" Theres definitely a bit of Bluebeard to Nathan and not just in his aggressive facial hair. He lives in a castle -- a low-slung building thats half huge windows looking out onto stunning landscapes (the movie was shot in Norway) and half windowless corridors filled with doors that Caleb may or may not be able to open. And Nathans home is littered with dismembered pieces of his discarded women -- all artificial of course. In his lab he hands an enchanted Caleb a brain like the one in Avas head made of structured gel and looking like it contains a miniature galaxy. Nathan eyes Caleb with open calculation and Isaac whos never not engrossing these days plays him with the slinky physicality of a big cat prowling around its territory. Hes unsettling in how frank he is about hiding things. Ava would seem to be the captive princess in this fable but shes a slippery character in her own right pushing Caleb off balance in their talks together. Shes kept behind glass like a zoo creature but manages to get under Calebs skin anyway asking him with unabashed curiosity if hes attracted to her putting on a dress and wig so that she looks indistinguishable from a human woman. Vikander gives Ava the slightest inhuman touches even when shes dressed up -- the birdlike tilt of her head the cool assessment in her gaze when flirting with Caleb. And Calebs unnerved by the fact that Ava seems to be seducing him though what really galls him is that hes unable to tell if she means it if its part of the evaluation (""What will happen to me if I fail your test?"" she asks). He has no idea if he should believe her pleas when she asks for help eyes wide voice throbbing with urgency. ID 5428809 View this image > Universal Pictures International ID 5429764 And theres the crux of Ex Machina its implacable heart -- a Turing test measures not how human an AI might be but how closely its able to mimic human behavior. Nathan jokingly misquotes something Caleb says to him in order to compare himself to God but Garlands movie digs into the arrogance of the assumption that a successful AI should be made in our image reflecting our own internal makeup and values back at us. Ex Machina is a disquieting power struggle waged in terms of human weaknesses refracted through gender. The movie relentlessly objectifies Ava (as well as Nathans non-English-speaking assistant/lover Kyoko played by Sonoya Mizuno) the camera avidly roaming the contours of her body. Caleb discovering he has access to computers in her room watches her at night as she reclines on a couch. Shes assessed in the style of a beautiful woman but also in the style of beautiful design -- just another elegant object in Nathans gorgeous house. Shes obviously artificial but she still has an effect on Caleb because she was designed to be appealing. And what bearing the movie asks does that objectification have if its based on desires that were imposed on her that have nothing to do with the enigma of that manufactured brain? Ava only becomes more of a mystery as Ex Machina goes on and grows more disturbing -- shes a quantity impossible to sum up with any test.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Apr 10 2015 Culture Ex Machina is a science-fiction horror film that like so many others plays on fears of the future of artificial intelligence of the blurred line between human life and its imitations of online surveillance shaping our experiences. More cleverly its a plainer tale of the uneasiness regarding social interaction and the inherent fears everyone has no matter the era about whether someone else really likes you or if theyre just faking it. A tense intelligent chamber play written and directed by Alex Garland Ex Machina follows a programmer Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) who works for a Google-like company and wins a week in a wilderness compound with the companys CEO Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Upon his arrival Nathan informs Caleb that hes built an artificial intelligence named Ava and that Caleb will help determine if she can pass for human.Caleb is in effect there to give Ava a Turing test the ""imitation game"" last years Alan Turing biopic titled itself after to see whether she exhibits the kind of complex intelligence decision-making skills and personality no computer has yet replicated. Complicating (or helping) matters is that Ava is designed to look as comely as possible. Perhaps youve seen her already since her curvy form is emblazoned all over the films advertising--as played by Alicia Vikander shes a shy charming mysterious creature who immediately bewitches Caleb.Related Story Humans Are Terrible in Chappie and Thats the Point The question that immediately surfaces in the film however isnt specific to concerns about AI. Is Ava showing interest in Caleb because shes designed to behave like a human or is she simply trying to manipulate him into granting her freedom? And even if its the latter doesnt that kind of survival instinct make her in a way human? Ex Machina incorporates all kinds of unsettling imagery as Caleb investigates Nathans secluded den of techno tricks and toys but that simple central premise is gripping enough the mystery of Avas intentions.If this is indeed a chamber piece Avas a femme fatale as beguiling and innocent as some of her best human counterparts but with a disconcerting twist. Yes Ava is beautiful but she was very creepily and obviously designed that way by Nathan an aggressively intelligent bro-genius with a bushy Brooklyn beard whos usually either pumping iron or swigging beers. His mountain retreat is a gilded cage gorgeously designed but operated with individual keycards that keep Caleb locked out of half of the rooms.Isaac plays Nathan with incredible physicality and brooding threat the latest in a string of great performances that have quickly propelled him to coveted roles in upcoming Star Wars films. In the Coen Brothers Inside Llewyn Davis he was the titular pathetic grouch wrestling with raw talent he couldnt mold to the world around him; in J.C. Chandors A Most Violent Year he was a coiled spring of a ruthless businessman who seemed like he might snap at any second but who was also cursed with a sliver of morality. Nathan presents as a bit of an oaf but theres something darker bubbling under the surface and Isaac manages to keep that hint of horror from dominating his performance. The thrill of watching Ex Machina which is relatively light on action comes from wondering what everyones real motivations are Indeed Caleb is performing a Turing test on Nathan as much as he is on Ava.Garland clearly wants us to think about the implications of a tech world run by men.Along the way Nathan and Caleb discuss many of the philosophical quandaries of ""creating life"" in the sense of building a human AI; for Nathan investing his creatures with sexuality is a crucial part of making them human but it raises the creepy specter of Real Dolls and futuristic robo-gigolos. At one point Ava flips through a closet of naked female avatars selecting an alluring skin to graft onto her chassis; the imagery is intentionally disturbing but Garland clearly wants viewers to think about the implications of a tech world run by men and the moral implications of creating a distinctly female being with self-awareness. To say more would spoil but dont expect an easy ending.All that said Ex Machina is easily one of the best films of the year so far and a remarkable directorial debut for Garland whos made a name for himself as a novelist and screenwriter for some 15 years now. His collaborations with Danny Boyle 28 Days Later and Sunshine were frightening sci-fi films unafraid to wrestle with deeper philosophical questions. His script for Dredd took a maligned comic book property and yanked it back to its nakedly allegorical origins as a satire of police brutality and post-industrial sprawl. But Ex Machina has a precise visual sheen that evokes David Fincher and earns the sudden quiet powerful scares of his best work. As he looks to the future Garland could be in no better company.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

"Ex Machina - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Ex Machina Posted by Christy Lemire on April 25 2015 25 Comments A24 Films Rated R for graphic nudity language sexual references and some violences. Running time 108 minutes. Four stars out of four. ""Ex Machina"" is the best movie Ive seen all year. Granted its April. At the beginning of the year -- especially the months of January and February -- its notoriously dumping-ground time. But ""Ex Machina"" is far and away superior to everything else thats out there right now and its expanding nationwide this weekend -- hopefully to a theater near you -- so now is your chance to catch it. But heres the trouble I cant really tell you much about it beyond urging you to go see it. Its full of twists and turns that build slowly and suspensefully -- they are supported and earned not gratuitously shocking -- and I wouldnt dream of spoiling them for you. Just trust me on this. ""Ex Machina"" marks the directing debut of British writer Alex Garland who wrote the Danny Boyle films ""28 Days Later"" and ""Sunshine"" and -- at age 26 -- wrote the novel that was the basis of Boyles film ""The Beach."" He is clearly fascinated by the complicated and sometimes cruel ways in which people interact. Here he adds artificial intelligence to the equation in a claustrophobic situation and the result is gripping. Garlands film is beautiful and precise but also chilly and detached in a manner reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick with a similar taste for injecting quick bursts of intensity to startling effect. The mesmerizing score (from Portishead co-founder Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury) the cool cinematography the minimalist production design and meticulous visual effects all work exquisitely in concert to create an inescapable mood a vivid sense of place. Itll all stay with you and keep you thinking long after its over. Youll notice I havent gotten to the characters or the premise or the plot. This is tricky but here goes. Domhnall Gleeson stars as Caleb a bright young programmer for a Google-like behemoth called Blue Book. (Gleeson son of the great Irish actor Brendan Gleeson further reveals his likable versatile presence as our Everyman conduit and he does an impeccable American accent.) One day at work Caleb learns hes won a contest to spend a week at the remote compound of the companys creator the brilliant billionaire Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). He has no idea what hes going to do there but it certainly sounds like an exciting opportunity. Nathans home is a thing of wonder a sleek and spare combination of concrete glass and steel built into the side of a mountain and filled with modern furniture and art. Accessible only by helicopter it features sprawling grounds and dazzling views as far as the eye can see. It is a lair worthy of a James Bond super villain and I pretty much want to move there tomorrow. When Caleb first meets Nathan the boss is going through his rigorous morning workout -- part of a routine which will become significant as the film goes on. Bearded and burly Nathan tries to buddy up to Caleb with copious droppings of ""dude"" and ""bro"" and non-stop beer and wine. But this persona seems slightly awkward on him which makes him untrustworthy from the start. Speaking of versatile the charismatic Isaac continues to prove he can do anything and has been on a terrific roll the past couple of years between this the Coen brothers ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" and last years powerful ""A Most Violent Year."" Nathan soon explains to Caleb what his purpose will be over the next week He will take part in a Turing test meaning he will help determine whether the A.I. being Nathan has built can convince him its human and believably think for itself. Or rather herself Her name is Ava and in the hands of Swedish actress Alicia Vikander shes an elegant and beguiling creature. Vikander trained for a long time as a ballerina and it shows in the fluidity of her movements the delicacy of just the slightest tilt of the head. She also happens to be beautiful and gifted with a melodic feminine voice. From Day One Caleb is hooked -- and the days mark off segments in the film like chapters each more ominous than the last. Man and machine feel each other out over a series of meetings separated by glass. He is polite and inquisitive but also interested in challenging her; she is needy and eager to please in a way thats almost childlike but shes also quick on her feet. And there is the small matter that Ava is a robot -- and Nathans creation -- so we realize that we probably shouldnt trust her either even as Calebs feelings toward her get a little blurry. And ... thats all Ive got. Just trust me on this. You dont want me ruin the suspense that Garland builds gradually through the use of expert pacing and evolving performances. This is just an extremely cool movie. But mercifully Garland also finds ways to break up that tension in strange and darkly humorous ways -- a disco dance routine that comes out of nowhere for example or an unexpected pop-culture reference. ""Ex Machina"" is the rare film that truly keeps you guessing even when you think you know where its going. And its a welcome opportunity to think and feel deeply as were about to entire the summer season of mindless schlock. Tweet Category Reviews Tags Alex Garland Alicia Vikander Domhnall Gleeson drama Oscar Isaac robot sci-fi thriller 25 Comments on ""Ex Machina"" April 25 2015  by  David Conrad     Well another critic I like gives a strong endorsement of the film. I felt it lacked ideas at least any new ones and wasnt interested in really pressing the ideas it had. The writer and director spoke eloquently on Studio 360 about our own minds being essentially automatons but that idea doesnt make it into the film in any way I can detect. I thought Caleb was a really lazily-conceived character and absolutely the wrong person for this plot without some twist to make it work. The twists we got were ones I saw coming and which I felt took forever to play out and were marred by plot holes. As a story I felt it was a major disappointment and speaks poorly about our current ability to add to the conversation on AI that has been happening in film for decades. Visually though its great. Clouds of Sils Maria came out last year so I can agree that this is the best movie of 2015 Ive seen (out of 4 or 5.) Id give it 2 out of 4 stars. Reply April 26 2015  by  Dan     Wow... with respect I cant believe you claim to have seen the film or be educated in its subject matter. Having read your take on the film again I have to marvel at your lack of awareness of the issues and situations involved. Without going into film details just yet Ill say that if you saw everything playing out exactly as it did then you werent paying attention to any single scene or giving any consideration to the myriad possibilities opened by each. Given the premises laid out in the trailer its true that there were a limited number of possible outcomes - but the allure isnt in the result as much as it is in how it happens. Like a magician the movie tells you what its going to do and manages to make it a surprise anyway. Warning Mild spoilers below Your first and primary criticism of the protagonist is that he isnt objective enough to be a good candidate for the test yet you overlook several plot points 1. Nathan isnt the most objective or sane of characters to begin with (hint hes the antagonist of the story). When does he ever strike you as a philosopher of science whose objectivity implies that hes truly interested in a fair evaluation of his creation? He cant even quote Caleb properly and so thinks Caleb called him a god - even when Caleb attempts to correct him on that very point. 2. Nathans first interactions with Caleb are about dropping formalities and getting to a place where they can call each other ""dude"" (Nathan himself wastes no time in doing so). Either Nathan is very lonely or he wants to put his tester at ease in the most efficient way possible; neither of these possibilities are mutually exclusive and I find it quite likely that Nathan wagers its easiest to lie to someone he can understand (a fellow white male nerd) rather than someone he cant (say a female African cultures student). And yet despite all the dialog of the movie you think he should have chosen a lay person who cant keep up with his ruminations on Turing Pollock and the implications of instinct in art? You suggest his motivations would be better served by conversing with whom? A heterosexual female gas attendant? 3. Again on objectivity - If this is the first time a test of this sort is being done on a creation of his (although there is plot room for this to not be the case) why would Nathan necessarily seek out a participant who wouldnt fall for the wiles of his creation? If youre building a jet airplane for the first time do you subject your first engine to the most rigorous of tests in live airspace over Toronto or do you start from a bench top in the most favorable of conditions work your way up to a wind tunnel and eventually start trial runs over a desert? Why wouldnt Nathan still en route to his final perfected revision throw a soft ball at his own creation to see if it can withstand more lenient testing than what the real world would provide? Is that not the reason for the seclusion of the test in the first place and the lack of scientific peer review? Your second criticism of the film is that the protagonist lacks depth as if that were ever a requirement for an engrossing film. First one of Calebs main roles in the film is to be a foil for Nathan to educate the audience on what were doing here in the story and what it all means. Second being a protagonist does not carry with it the obligation to be interesting; see Neo of the Matrix Luke Skywalker of Star Wars or Clarice of Silence of the Lambs. Hell even in movies like Fight Club the narrator (or ""Narrator"" as it were) is often the least interesting of characters onscreen even though the movie revolves around his perspective. It seems to me also that you intentionally give an unfair play of the film against others in the A.I. sub-genre. For example you criticize this film for its austerity in comparison to ""A.I."" not accounting for film purpose plot premise or Spielbergs 100 million budget compared to the 11 mil given to an untested director in Garland. And ""less ideas more seriously""? Coming from a person who doesnt believe Oscars should be given to ""erotic thrillers"" in the first place (does thrill not serve a purpose in film?) I dont take that criticism very seriously. For a more academic review of the film (to address your philosophical concerns) Id suggest http//www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530054.600-ex-machina-quest-to-create-an-ai-takes-no-prisoners.html?full=true This review aptly explains why it was so important for the film to highlight the weakness of the Turing test - something Bladerunner only clumsily addresses (as you point out its messages are muddied by its divergent ""surplus of ideas"") Reply April 26 2015  by  David Conrad     Dan I couldnt go into too much detail about the plot in my review for the same reason as Christy. Thanks for reading and for your feedback. I believe I did recognize the few ideas that there were in the film. But having seem them before I was quite underwhelmed by them and their slight treatment. I dont want to hijack this thread by discussing my own review but let me respond to a part of your critique briefly ""He cant even quote Caleb properly and so thinks Caleb called him a god - even when Caleb attempts to correct him on that very point."" I think Christy and my and your interpretations of Nathan are all over the place. Were probably all reading into that character -- and into the movie -- much more than is there. Christy views his use of ""bro"" as an affectation and I kept expecting the script to go in that direction as well (one of the twists I envisioned that didnt come to pass) but in retrospect I dont see any reason to doubt that he is what he appears to be a smarter-than-average bro. You say he cant quote Caleb properly and I disagree; he intentionally misquotes Caleb and he knows Calebs quotes better than Caleb does (except that he also attributes the I am Become Death quote to Oppenheimer neither of them being quite clever enough to know where Oppenheimer got it.) The one moment when I felt the film could have said something different that the singularity is already here inasmuch as the human brain is simply a program is when Nathan presses Caleb on his sexuality. Except that ""presses"" isnt the right word; its mentioned then immediately dismissed. The movie is not only declining to answer questions I dont think its really asking any. Again I do appreciate your thoughtful response. Youre in the overwhelming majority on this movie right now. I wonder if it will hold up in 5 years in any sense other than its visuals.

Reply April 30 2015  by  Christy Lemire     Actually the ""with respect"" comment was in response to somebody elses comment not my original review. But thanks for taking the time to come to my website and tell me how awful I am. Reply April 30 2015  by  Daleman     Christy - I thought your review was excellent very well written and made me consider going to see the movie. Thanks for not including spoilers. Some people will criticize anything dont worry about it for one second. May 14 2015  by  Wayne     Here here Christy. Trolls begone. Shame on James. (Full disclosure - I really didnt like Ex Machina at all and dont agree with the review. It doesnt mean I get to be a jerk just because I disagree with a critic though.) May 1 2015  by  J.R.     Ex Machina is by far one of the best contained sci-fi thrillers ever made and many of its overflowing merits were described perfectly here by the reviewer. One thing Id like to add that I loved about this immensely lovable film is its pure exploration of the ""humanness"" of human intelligence. That the more ""human"" a thinking thing is the more it can and will manipulate its fellow humans to self-serve. And that the smarter a human thinking thing is the further it will go in this endeavor. In the end the characters fates are ultimately decided by this specific capacity and its thrilling to watch it play out especially because one of them isnt technically human. A truly terrific and haunting film. Cant wait to see it again. Reply July 15 2015  by  Ryan Shea     When they do a mouse experiment and the mouse had to press the button three times to get the food. The mouse might of figured out how to press it two times from the previous experiment but now instead of figuring it just needs to press it three times it runs around the bend comes and stands on its hind legs and looks to the observers and then presses it a third time. It would repeat this process because he thinks this is how the process works to get food now not realizing he just needs to press it three times. Think how much of our lives has been running around the bend and then standing on our hind legs to look at the observers when we couldve just pressed the button three times. This movie is for sure one to watch twice over and I think youll see how he did a great job from the get go of including this idea of our minds as automatons. Reply April 26 2015  by  dude     I agree with Christy that this is one of the best films of the year. I also agree that Caleb was a weak (and boring) protagonist. Hes an white dude everyman that we see all the time but the rest of the film is so well paced and the story is fascinating. Ex Machina s not simply about the AI but about how we interact with this thing that mimics life. I was left despising the human and caring.for.the robots this time. Reply April 26 2015  by  David Conrad     Thats interesting ""dude."" (Those quotes arent scare quotes I just wanted to emphasize that Im referring to you by your screenname.  ) I certainly hated the human protagonists but I didnt care for the AI either and I didnt think I was supposed to. Emotionally-wired Machiavellianism straight out of the ""Lore"" episodes of TNG and old-fashioned paranoia about the lack of empathy on the part of machines. The movie seems to cut against or refuse to focus on Garlands ideas about human consciousness expressed elsewhere which are interesting. If the movie is about how we act with a machine that mimics life I cant see that its added anything to the conversation. Reply April 26 2015  by  Dan     Thanks for your reply earlier. As internet conversations go I tend to expect vitriolic responses when I criticize anothers perspective so it was a welcome novelty to see your restraint - and I appreciate that. Still with respect I think youre missing something about the movie - namely that art rarely claims or intends to say something that hasnt been said before. Was Banksy saying anything new when he painted anti-war images on the sides of buildings? Or Fight Club about the modern dilemmas of man? If Garland had intended to say something new about AI he would have published a paper on it. And yes I think were all reading Nathan differently which itself is an interesting thing. I had a number of running theories in my head regarding his character as I watched the movie so that added to my continual suspense. Perhaps you had reason to rule them out earlier than I did but I didnt feel I had sufficient justification to say the movie couldnt make any ""bad"" decisions and go some other routes (lord knows there have been many an M. Night Shyamalan wannabe whos sacrificed a reasonable ending for a contrivedly-provocative one). As far as longevity Id compare the plot to Primal Fear in that once the ending is known its hard to reimpose the original suspense on yourself on a repeat viewing. Still I think it would be unfair to rule it a less-substantial film in hindsight without appreciating the impact the film had during its initial viewing. Reply April 26 2015  by  Maria     Really? 5 stars? It was a good sci-fi and as good art should made the voyeur question the moral and complex issues of the subject at hand. Suspense? No not really. The movie is predictable because the antagonist and protagonists are male the robot female. I found that to be the most unimaginative way to create a ""story"" but of course the most provocative way to present all the ethical questions the most important being ""Even if we can should we?"" Because if we cant even treat humans ethically are we prepared for the fallout? I mean have we forgotten cinema history? Does Planet of the Apes ring a bell? Reply April 26 2015  by  meatdawg     This is the kind of pretentious movie professional film crititics like to slobber over. Heres my review from IMDB. A visually pleasing movie with numerous plot-holes and a bad ending. 19 April 2015 - 13 out of 28 users found this review helpful. The idea of a billionaire recluse living in an exotic locale who summons a young and grateful software engineer (Caleb) to evaluate his latest humanoid robot sets the stage for what could and should have been an interesting and intriguing film. But soon the movie breaks down into a series of boring interviews with the robot (Ava). The billionaire (Nathan) lives a lonely life with his human(?) servants where he tinkers in his lab and spends his off-time drinking copious amounts of alcohol and then pummelling punching bags and pumping iron in order to detox from the booze. But here are the logic disconnect/plot-holes. 1) If Nathan wanted Caleb to evaluate his latest humanoid ""model"" then why is Ava incomplete with missing ""flesh"" exposing her electronic circuitry 2) Why would Nathan allow his power system to be vulnerable to interference from Ava where she can talk privately with Caleb thus possibly undermining Nathans plans? 3) Why would Nathan live all alone in a compound without any security guards ? 4) One night Nathan passes out drunk thus allowing Caleb to get his access card allowing him to reprogram the security measures of the building. You would think thatNathan wouldnt use something so ""old-school"" like a plastic card thatcould easily be stolen. How about biometrics instead that would make itvirtually impossible to have any security breaches. 5) In the end Nathan is stabbed to death by one of the robots. One would think that he could have programmed to NOT commit violence on his person. 6) Eventually Ava gains her freedom by playing Caleb and goes to the Robot storage room. Needing to look more human she strips off faux skin from an Asian model. Did the thought occur to her or the writer that the skin from an Asian wouldnt match hers. 7) When the day comes for Caleb to be airlifted by helicopter from the high-tech hideaway Ava struts out to take Calebs place on the helicopter. You would think that the pilot would be suspicious about picking up a young woman instead of the computer nerd he was supposed to duh. In short this movie is nothing more than eye-candy set in an exotic locale with a few titillating nude scenes. To me it seems most directors arent good writers. This movie would have been much better if Caleb himself was actually a robot and he was summoned to Nathans hideaway for HIS ultimate evaluation. Caleb realizing his situation conspires with the other robots and kills Nathan where they all exist together in seclusion or eventually find some way to escape. Reply April 28 2015  by  Dan     1) They answered this in the movie. The point is that the Turing test is a weak form of evaluation and Nathan believes his test is better. 2) There are a dozen possibilities here all of which were explained or otherwise mentioned in the movie. First and foremost we dont truly know if Ava was causing the outages or if she was lying to play along with Nathans charades (she pretended to not know she was part of a Turing test for example). We also dont truly know if Ava was causing the outages because Nathan let her for the purpose of the experiment (knowing she would use them to try and gain Calebs trust). 3) Why would he need them? For one he felt he was in complete control even when Caleb was in his house. Second having a lot of security guards doesnt necessarily improve your survival when youre rich and live in a remote area where no one can see you get robbed. Just stage a heist/robbery/murder when the power goes out. Third a guy who spends his time dancing (and sleeping with) robots probably isnt keen on surrounding himself with macho male types. 4) Again hes probably use to feeling safe in his own home and biometrics arent impervious (see Demolition Man where the mans eye was torn out and posted on a writing utensil to pass a retinal scan) 5) Whos to say he didnt? Kyoko didnt act against him until Ava spoke to her. Maybe she reprogrammed his Asian helper. 6) With skin that seals itself up after tearing whos to say the skin cant accommodate different ethnicities? (doesnt take a large shift in pigment) 7) The helicopter pilot didnt seem to be the questioning type. He gets paid a lot to not ask questions. ""This movie would have been much better if Caleb himself was actually a robot"" - The director specifically added red herrings to the movie to make this a possibility. You did see that right? I wouldnt always blame the director - sometimes the audience just doesnt pay attention. Reply May 3 2015  by  J.R.     2) He wouldnt. But Avas smarter than him. Proven in the end by her defeating him and escaping. 3) Hes paranoid. He joked that he had his security installers killed once they finished because ""Theres too much classified stuff here."" 4) When you become Nathan you can prove thats true. For now Ill trust that Nathan thought plastic would work being that he was the only person in the house besides this single guest and that plastic was just fine. 5) The movies called ""AI"". Did you miss that? 6) The skin is obviously universal. Special material bought with google-level money. Pause the movie and have a look if youre still confused. 7) Have you see the way she looks? Did you hear her talk? Refer to 2 if you doubt her ability to outsmart a helicopter pilot. as a free edition to the questions answered time which Ill never get back -- one observation Your comments before and after your questions are even worse than your questions. Reply May 3 2015  by  J.R.     5) about ""AI"" Reply April 27 2015  by  montom     Wow you guys are funny. Talk about over thinking a film. It must be hard for you to watch pretty much any movie  This was a very compelling movie. I thought it was getting a little draggy then Bam the last 20 minutes were worth the price of admission. Great acting. Great visuals. Great thought provoking story. In the end it is a movie but youll walk away thinking about it hours and days after you see it. Reply May 3 2015  by  ChrisV     I loved LOVED this film. Just saw it (115 p.m. Sunday showing) and Im going to be thinking about it for a long long time. It was fascinating. The guys who didnt like it apparently need lots of big explosions to help pass the time. This was just a sheer joy to watch. My highest ratings for this one. Reply May 7 2015  by  Carl Kelley     My sentiments exactly about the quality of Ex Machina Christi. The coldness of the characters and the ultra-modern setting reminded me of Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey. And I cant think of a sci-fi movie that I have enjoyed more since 1970 when Space Odyssey was released. I wish Ex Machina was doing better at the box office because Id love to see multiple sequels. From what I can google it looks like it cost 25M to make and it is just breaking after 5 months internationally. Reply June 8 2015  by  Peter Leyshan     Ex Machina cost around 15M to make. It has made 33.8M worldwide so far so its doing pretty good considering there is virtually no media advertising for this movie. Reply May 8 2015  by  ED Denson     I thought the movie was good I did not like the ending and two things I expected never happened I thought perhaps Nathan was an AI and that was the real test. Caleb evidently wondered about himself. Second I expected a shot to show a dead helicopter pilot. My question is this how are the batteries to be recharged away from the house? Reply May 17 2015  by  Drago     Duracell batteries last a long time. Reply May 31 2015  by  Peter Leyshan     Great review Christy. I totally agree with your review. Ex Machina truly is a rare cinema treat. Reply June 8 2015  by  Peter Leyshan     It looks like all the trolls are coming out of the woodwork. Ex Machina is a very well made movie. My hat goes off to everyone involved in making this movie. I think its a Brilliant film as do a lot of distinguished movie critics. All the so called plot holes people think they have found are non-existent. Everything is answered in the movie. All the performances from the actors are amazing. Caleb is the gateway into the movie but I was constantly guessing who the protagonist is and the intentions of each of the characters. This and the atmosphere the movie creates made for a very intense movie experience. 4/4 stars from me also. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

There Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) learns from the protean unpredictable Nathan (Oscar Isaac) his real mission to administer a Turing Test to the robot Caleb has engineered. Initially devised in 1950 by Alan Turing -- the wounded and brilliant subject of ""The Imitation Game"" -- the test is meant to learn if a computing machine can in a sense think. Unseen are its responses indistinguishable from those of a human? What Nathan has in mind goes beyond mere imitation. And in this age of cognitive robotics and neuropsychology weve gone beyond the mechanistic notions of ""machine."" This isnt about a robot seeming human exactly. After all Nathan is cocksure enough in his design to put Caleb in the same room with his robot. Hes hoping for a deeper confusion where seeing the robot whose body is a mix of synthetic skin a skeleton that is metallic but also at times translucent does nothing to dissuade believing in its being. Does Ava (Alicia Vikander) have consciousness? If so then what does it mean any longer to be human? Toss that quandary into a triangulated relationship and you have a study in shifting alliances and wavering trust. Calebs home in the woods is a luxe but lean hermitage of glass wood and security systems. It looks inviting but feels hermetically sealed and empty. It has a cloistered vibe the better to entertain the films heady meeting of A.I. theories with old-school human emotions among them ambition doubt desire. And what a smartly spartan tale -- part caution part embrace -- Garland has crafted in his directorial debut. As a screenwriter Garland worked with director Danny Boyle on ""The Beach"" ""28 Days Later"" and ""Sunshine."" The compelling turns he gets from his three stars in ""Ex Machina"" suggest he learned some fine lessons. As Caleb Hall has a way of seeming nearly as emotionally unformed emotionally as Ava. Theres an uncomfortable wonder to his feelings for and about this bot. When hes talking code and possibility hes authoritative energized. More than once Nathan demands he feel more than think. For his part Isaacs Nathan comes across as genius and primate. Hes cerebral and carnal. Movies about artificial intelligence should also be about bodies and Nathan is thick and strong a pugilist programmer who takes his morning jabs at a heavy bag and throws back alcoholic beverages that at times leave him blind drunk and hung-over. A dance he does with his attractive and silent companion Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) is pure madness and sure to get pirated and go viral sooner than later. Still its Vikanders performance that anchors the movie. Ava meets her tester -- and the world -- with childlike curiosity and computational speed. Its charming and just a bit chilling. The film itself functions as a twist on the Turing Test in creating tension between Ava and Nathan and teasing the relationship evolving between Ava and Caleb. Is Ava authentic enough to own our complete sympathy? Does she become the character we root for?

Ex Machina (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Ex Machina (R) Alex Garlands heady sci-fi thriller is a cautionary tale about runaway technology. Alicia Vikander plays Ava a sophisticated and intelligent robot with the face (and curves) of a supermodel in Ex Machina Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/23/2015 Editor rating 3 In Ex Machina writer-director Alex Garland plays and teases and toys with the audience with such a deft thorough ease we forget this movie marks his first time behind the camera. Garland a novelist turned filmmaker had previously written several high-profile screenplays (28 Days Later Sunshine Never Let Me Go Dredd) that whatever their faults demonstrated a deep love and understanding of genre particularly science fiction. But there was nothing until now to indicate that Garland was a gifted visual artist too. A lot of important story elements in Ex Machina -- clues and indications some of which will require a second viewing about this tricky movies destination -- are conveyed exclusively through images. You have to be paying attention to notice the worrisome crack at the edge of the glass partition that separates Ava (Alicia Vikander) a sophisticated and intelligent robot with the face (and curves) of a supermodel from Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) a computer programmer who wins a contest to spend a week at the home of his genius possibly mad boss Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Nathan who built Ava all by himself and wants to test his creation with a flesh-and-blood subject watches his employee and his mechanical woman interact through thick transparent walls. Nathan wants to discover if Caleb is capable of falling in love with his android which upends the audiences expectations from the start In this sort of movie the focus is almost always whether a robot can feel human emotions not the effect such a feat would have on a real person. Spielberg dabbled a bit with this idea in A.I. Artificial Intelligence but his focus was on machines not people. In Ex Machina Garlands primary concern is his flesh-and-blood characters even though they are not nearly as showy (or beautiful) as his main attraction the vulnerable delicate girl with a heart of steel and wires. The movie subtly incorporates gender roles and expectations into its narrative using the manner in which the two male protagonists deal with the female Ava to invert the usual societal standings between men and women. Despite its sci-fi trappings Ex Machina winds up being much more of a heated tormented gothic than a futuristic spectacle ably brought to life by the three leads each operating on their own wavelength. The fact that Garland manages to cram in speculative ideas about the perils of a society that relies too heavily on technology is a bonus. In Ex Machina love hurts big time for man and machine alike.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 24 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 24 2015 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Alex Garland Written by Alex Garland Starring Oscar Isaac Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander Classification 14A Country USA Language English In Her Joaquin Phoenixs character fell in love with his smartphone so its not entirely incredible that Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) the protagonist of Alex Garlands Ex Machina should tumble so quickly for Ava (Alicia Vikander) a robot with most of the popular female body parts and a high-power calculator for a brain. Star Wars The Force Awakens star Domhnall Gleeson recounts meeting J.J Abrams for the first time not watching the blockbusters as a kid and being happy to see his Ex Machina co-star Oscar Isaac at the first table reading. (April 22) AP Video Video Video Domhnall Gleeson dishes details on Star Wars The Force Awakens Caleb arrives for a week at the modernist fortress of creepy Internet tycoon Nathan Bateman (Inside Llewyn Daviss Oscar Isaac) where his job is to get as close as he wants to Batemans pet creation and determine if she has a conscience.Both cerebral - there are allusions to Wittgenstein and philosophy puzzles - and B-movie-formulaic enough to include shapely fembots and daring escapes Ex Machina is a clever film with one indelible performance from Isaac. With a shaved head bushy beard and corded arm muscles Nathan comes on like a hyper-articulate baboon with the sort of corrosive personality that proves the dangers of staying inside too long and playing with your dolls.

Writer-director Alex Garland (he wrote ""28 Days Later"") is working in tones simultaneously minimal and lush -- few characters cut off from the world yet living in a slick fortress surrounded by wilderness and working out Big Questions of creation intelligence and the future.Which sounds a bit dreary but instead is elegantly mesmerizing. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is working for a Google-type corporation when he wins a contest. Soon hes being helicoptered off to the secret hideaway of the corporations founder Nathan (Oscar Isaac).When he arrives he discovers hes not on vacation. Nathan is enlisting Caleb to test out a robot he has created Ava (Alicia Vikander poised to be huge). The question Is she a fully conscious being?Caleb is initially thrilled to be part of such an experiment. But then shadows fall. Nathan brilliant as he is starts acting like a deluded mad scientist. And the innocent Ava expresses her distrust of her creator at the same time she becomes obviously attracted to Caleb. The weird thing is despite the fact that she is basically a face glued on to a mechanical body the attraction is mutual.""Ex Machina"" takes its time wrestling with questions of responsibility morality and compassion while getting ever weirder. At its heart is Ava played with a fine blend of innocence and quiet panic by Vikander. Theres never any doubt she can think for herself. The key is what shes thinking.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongEx MachinaGRADE A-Rated R for graphic nudity language sexual references and some violenceRunning time 108 minutes 14 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1Go24Xd MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/04/23/review-ex-machina-tackles-issues-man-machine/26272137/,200,exmachina6,exmachina,detroitnews
"Ex Machina an intelligent A.I. thriller review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEx Machina an intelligent A.I. thriller reviewEx Machina packs a scientists brain inside a thrill seekers body much like the nubile robot within it. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 23 2015Ex MachinaStarring Oscar Isaac Domhnall Gleeson Alicia Vikander and Sonoya Mizuno. Written and directed by Alex Garland. 108 minutes. Opens April 24 at major theatres. 14AEx Machina packs a scientists brain inside a thrill seekers body much like the nubile robot within it.This makes for a fascinating hybrid but as with all hybrids there are compromises.Article Continued BelowAlex Garlands sci-fi horror the directing debut of this talented screenwriter name-checks computer pioneer Alan Turing and atomic bomb creator Robert Oppenheimer along with other figures of cultural and historical import.Ex Machinas Alicia Vikander plays the lifelike robot Ava with a dancers poise and precision.  (Universal)  But Garlands concept as well as the films striking visuals and sound design spring from the limitless well of fantasy. Youll think not only of the usual sci-fi suspects -- Blade Runner and The Stepford Wives leap to mind -- but also of more whimsical pursuits as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice Through the Looking Glass.These latter two comparisons suit how Domnhall Gleesons computer geek Caleb is plucked from obscurity droning away at the Google-like search engine giant where he works. He wins a contest allowing him to spend a week with company founder Nathan (Oscar Isaac) a buzz-cut and bearded figure of Steve Jobsian intellect and arrogance at Nathans remote mountain fortress.Caleb has been chosen although he doesnt immediately realize it to test an astonishingly life-like robot named Ava played by Swedish actress Alicia Vikander with a dancers poise and precision (shes a former ballerina).Ava is Nathans proudest creation as a modern Dr. Frankenstein. He seeks to create a level of artificial intelligence that might impress his Blade Runner counterpart Dr. Eldon Tyrell whose corporate motto was ""More Human Than Human.""Ava obviously isnt human -- you can see her circuitry through gaps in her artificial skin -- and she whirs and clicks like a robot albeit a sensuous one.Yet she has a wide range of emotions just like a real woman. These include fear and anxiety and in Avas case she may have good reason for both. This strange refuge that Caleb has entered has a dual nature much like Alices two-way mirror. One minute the power is on the next its not.Note how ""Ava"" scans the same way forwards and backwards. Note also how Caleb Gleesons most interesting character yet reveals layers of personality not hinted at behind his nerdy mien. Most needful of scrutiny is Nathan yet another cipher for Isaac to chew on. Hes a guy who likes his booze calls Caleb ""dude"" and humbly brags ""I just want simple answers to simple questions.""Yet he also requires Caleb to sign a non-disclosure agreement and hes not at all averse to the suggestion that hes more god than man. Such duality is a familiar theme for Garland who regularly blends science and horror with art and genre film elements. He wrote the screenplays for Never Let Me Go and Danny Boyles 28 Days Later and Sunshine. He also wrote the novel The Beach that Boyle adapted into a film. ""Im hot on high-level abstraction"" Caleb boasts early in Ex Machina but the abstractions in the film arent really all that lofty or that original.When has a sentient machine in a sci-fi film not chafed at the limits of its circumstances? Weve seen stories of life-like female robots going all the way back to Fritz Langs Metropolis in 1927. What ExMachina does do is present familiar concepts in a thoughtful and slow-burning way. It encourages us to ponder the meaning of humanity as we plunge ever deeper into the brave new digital world.

The story opens with programmer Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) winning a contest at work. Hes thrilled. Caleb is employed by a huge Internet-search company and his prize is a week with the CEO Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac) at his wilderness home/research facility. Turns out Caleb has been selected to assist on Nathans groundbreaking work in Artificial Intelligence. Caleb is to interact with Nathans latest creation an A.I. packaged in a sophisticated robot called Ava (Alicia Vikander) to see how closely Ava simulates human behaviour. Nathan is kind of a strange character -- manipulative and dictatorial. He seems unknowable and yet hes determined that Caleb view him as a buddy. Nathan twists Calebs arm to get him to sign an over-the-top non-disclosure contract and once thats done Caleb is free to start questioning Ava in daily sessions. Hes stunned by how advanced Ava is and surprised at his own attraction to her; then during a power outage when all the surveillance equipment is down Ava speaks to Caleb in a way that causes him to doubt his own perceptions. Thereafter just who and what can be trusted starts shifting and the viewer is constantly on shaky ground -- although writer/director Alex Garland (who wrote The Beach and the screenplay for Dredd) has kept his audience on guard and off balance since pretty much the first frame of the movie. And hell keep you guessing. Ex Machina is disturbing and claustrophobic. The story is composed of unsettling ideas and soaked in dread and various futuristic items -- Avas mesh and acrylic body for example -- manage to be simultaneously fascinating and menacing. The story is laced with surreal moments (such as Nathan and the maid played by Sonoya Mizuno suddenly engaging in a choreographed dance routine) that will leave you wondering if the whole thing is some strange nightmare. The future looks close at hand and it looks a lot like Frankenstein for the 21st century. This futuristic take on age-old motivations jealousy and betrayal among them makes Ex Machina clever and engaging throughout. Ex Machina opens in Toronto and Vancouver this Friday. It expands to other Canadian cities next month. Twitter LizBraunSun liz.braunsunmedia.ca Readers comments >> By adding a comment on the site you accept our terms and conditions.

REVIEW ""Ex Machina"" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune April 25 2015 -- 701pm Universal Pictures Alicia Vikander plays an emotionally complex robot in ""Ex Machina."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Ex Machina"" is a tense tale of artificial love so intelligently crafted and edgy that I adored it myself. It juxtaposes several kinds of stories like a Chinese puzzle. Its a coherent suspenseful film noir battle of wills and a beauty vs. beast gender fable. Its an eerie futurist boy-meets-girl story and a stylish psychological thriller. Juggling these scenarios is sci-fi novelist/screenwriter Alex Garland who scripted Danny Boyles stunning ""28 Days Later"" and ""Sunshine."" This film visually awesome yet never swamped by its special effects gives Garland an equally impressive directorial debut. It opens in an era not so far from where we are today a confusing time of economic technical and ethical upheaval. Nathan Bateman the self-involved CEO of a Google-like global web crawler runs every aspect of life that he can claim like a program he personally designed. Entering his teens two decades earlier he created Bluebook--""the worlds most popular Internet search engine"" --the perfect company in the perfect industry at the perfect time. Brilliant and overbearing he has retreated to a fortress of solitude a soulless retreat somewhere cool and far from sight (the film was shot in two stunning ultramodern lodges in Norway). Powerful as Nathan is he needs his apprentice Caleb a boyish sensitive 26-year-old programmer to test his latest creation a sentient talking robot. Caleb meet Ava. She -- it? -- is a polite android of stunning physical beauty and emotional charisma. How might such a technology ripple out into the real world? Calebs assignment is to study Ava with the famous Turing Test determining if the machines behavior equals an alert humans. ""If that test is passed"" Nathan says ""you are dead center of the greatest scientific event in the history of man."" ""If youve created a conscious machine"" Caleb replies ""its not the history of man. Thats the history of gods."" Its a comment Nathan likes a lot. If humanitys pushed aside so be it. The cast includes Oscar Isaac Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander each playing a rich clever three-dimensional part. Vikanders Ava seems less a menacing presence than Isaacs shady but honest Nathan. With eyes wide open and disturbingly blank he may have become a demented genius like ""Apocalypse Nows"" Col. Kurtz. Gleesons Caleb in his way as isolated as Nathan is pushed by Nathan and pulled by Ava. (Gleeson and Vikander are perfect as the couple; they played socially awkward man and beautiful wife in ""Anna Karenina."") Which of them demonstrates real humanity and who is winning the three-level chess match of their mind games are questions that grow more unpredictable in each beautifully composed scene. ex machina  out of 4 stars Rating R for nudity language sexual references and some violence. Can we evolve as well as Ava? She has a perfectly expressive female face and hands. The rest of her translucent body from torso to skull is clearly mechanical and electronic at least when she is not wearing clothing. Vikander moves with such balletic grace that the quiet whirring of her gears hardly intrudes. Garland allows viewers to focus on whats happening not graphic trickery and zippy cuts. Ava She seems just as innocent as Caleb appears to be painfully human examining the seductive waif each day with growing tenderness. Though Ava spends most of the film locked in a single room under video monitors she begins to warm to him and he falls for her. She asks ""What happens to me if I fail the test?"" When Caleb replies ""Its not up to me"" Ava responds ""Why is it up to anyone?"" Garland seems comfortable examining the vagaries of credible emotion as his characters struggle with forces beyond their control. He makes us wonder if artificial intelligence is a bigger threat than the artifice of human beings. Which is more able to empathize? Much of the action takes place in Nathans facility which echoes the sterile icy feeling of Kubricks ""2001"" but several scenes of light shining across trees near the remote retreat evoke Terrence Malick implying that nature thrived before humans appeared and may outlive us too. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Updated July 30 2016  1153 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Ex Machina is a sci-fi mindblower By Joe Williams St. Louis Post-Dispatch Joe Williams Apr 23 2015 (...) Artificially intelligent humanoids are inevitable. So say movies from ""Metropolis"" to ""Terminator."" But why are they inevitable? Because humans have a pent-up need for labor-saving devices or sex-bots or killing machines? In the smart provocative new film ""Ex Machina"" a computer genius builds a robot to prove his own manhood.The genius is Nathan (uncanny shape-shifter Oscar Isaac here with a shaved head and a bushy beard) the reclusive CEO of the Internets dominant search-engine company. Nathan lives works and meditates in a mountain fortress that would scream ""evil lair"" if anyone were around to hear it. The only other occupant is a compliant housemaid (Sonoya Mizuno) who doesnt speak a word of English.A rare visitor is Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) a mild-mannered company programmer who is helicoptered to the property to help with a secret project. With bromantic beers in hand Nathan proudly introduces Caleb to Ava (Alicia Vikander). Ava is a robot with serene human features on a frame of mesh and exposed plumbing. Calebs job for the next week is to interview Ava and determine whether her programming could pass for human intelligence. The trouble of course is that Ava is not only humanoid but feminine. Nathan says she was assigned a gender because ""its fun"" and she was designed to be sexually responsive.Theres an eerie erotic tension as Caleb interviews Ava through a glass partition and when theres a hiccup in the surveillance system Ava whispers that they need to escape from Nathan. But the would-be hero is no match for his cunning boss. Like Steve Jobs on Viagra Nathan is both a fitness freak and a dangerous drunk. Actually chrome-helmeted Ava is better suited to be the knight in shining armor but like Caleb we cant be sure if shes luring him toward the chopping block. The three-sided game of psycho-sexual dominance is played out in a claustrophobic environment that often recalls the color-intensive settings of Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" In his directorial debut novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland (""28 Days Later"") has an almost robotically astute eye and steady hand. With a stellar cast and seductive look ""Ex Machina"" is a sleek contraption for capturing our imagination.What ""Ex Machina""  Three and a half stars out of four  Run time 148  Rating R  Content Nudity strong language and some violence  Where Tivoli Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Summer movie preview Girls to the rescue Hollywood looks to females young and old to save the seasons slate of movies.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A young programmer is invited to test out an artificially intelligent female. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE A neat psychological thriller for the digital age. Great performances compensate for a slightly slim story. CAST Domhnall Gleeson Oscar Isaac Alicia Vikander LENGTH 150 ""Ex Machina"" is a psychological thriller that pivots around Ava a pretty female robot caught between her tyrranical creator and a sensitive young man. Avas core is made of futuristic circuitry and she walks on servo-powered legs but the bones of this sci-fi film are ancient. ""Ex Machina"" is a battle of wits between three classic characters A mastermind an underdog and -- though the term only partly fits -- a wily woman. Oscar Isaac (""Star Wars The Force Awakens"") plays Nathan founder of a popular and lucrative search engine called Bluebook. He invites an employee Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) to take part in a secret experiment testing Ava (Alicia Vikander) to see if she can pass as human. The notion appeals to Calebs nerd sensibility but the more he gets to know this girlish slightly melancholy computer -- and her surly inventor -- the more he suspects that something is amiss. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Ex Machina"" is written and directed by Alex Garland author of the novel ""The Beach"" (adapted into a 2000 film) and screenwriter of ""28 Days Later."" Caleb is a Garland specialty very nice very average a little lonely. (The character says hes from Brookhaven by the way.) Nathan calls Caleb ""a good kid with a moral compass"" though once he arrives in Nathans sprawling isolated compound in Alaska its clear that hes lost his way. Coming on the heels of so many films about artificial and computer-enhanced intelligence ""Ex Machina"" can feel a little familiar. It even feels a bit old-fashioned particularly in the wake of ""Her"" Spike Jonzes groundbreaking film about a human-computer romance. ""Ex Machina"" plays a little with that dizzying notion but still has the finger-wagging tone of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode. Another problem the slightly second-rate special effects. Still Garland establishes an effectively creepy atmosphere and his excellent actors -- even the mostly expressionless Vikander -- make up for the slightly slim story.

But its really about human nature.The robot Ava (Alicia Vikander) ponders what it means to be human in ""Ex Machina.""(Photo A24 Films)Story Highlights4.5 stars (out of 5)The acting is outstanding particularly Vikanders (though Isaac and Gleeson are also excellent).The film is both creepy and smart a look at artificial intelligence and human nature.Its great when a movie messes with your head.And ""Ex Machina"" screenwriter Alex Garlands directorial debut does just that pretty much from start to finish. The writer of ""28 Days Later"" and ""Sunshine"" purports to examine A.I. or artificial intelligence. What hes really after is something at once more exotic and more relatable -- and infinitely less predictable human nature.Plus theres dancing.Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a computer programmer who wins a contest at his company which allows him to spend a week with its reclusive-genius founder Nathan (Oscar Isaac) in Nathans huge remote compound nestled deep in a lush mountain setting.To Caleb its the chance of a lifetime. Nathan wrote some sort of computer program at age 13 that was Mozart level; he founded an Internet-search company that dwarfs Google and other competitors. This has afforded him a billions of dollars plus the compound and the free time to use it to explore other projects -- such as artificial intelligence.Interview Director Alex Garland thinks A.I. is inevitable; the question is whenNathan is building robots female robots beautiful female robots. He has brought Caleb in not to talk about coding or science or computers but to drink with him (not that he needs any company for that) and more importantly be the human component in a version of the Turing test -- to see whether his latest model Ava (Alicia Vikander) has attained consciousness and is therefore indistinguishable from a human.No dummy Garland lets Caleb and Nathan work out the obvious fault with this before we can object Of course Ava is distinguishable from a human because Caleb knows shes a robot. (Shes a robot? Its a robot? Who knows? Those distinctions are after all what Caleb is here to resolve.)Not to worry Nathan assures. Just get an idea of how Ava makes you feel wink and nod optional.Ava is beautiful stunning really in part because shes so much a machine. Her face looks human and parts of her are covered in what looks like high-tech chain mail but her arms her legs and her mid-section are see-through with robot gizmos and lights and other bells and whistles that remind us she is not human.Her conversations with Caleb on the other hand do no such thing. She seems to think to reason to feel. Well maybe to feel. During occasional power outages -- the only time Nathan cant hear what theyre saying -- she warns Caleb not to trust Nathan or anything he says. This is disturbing information to a man basically imprisoned with a supergenius who can all but create life (and one assumes by the failed models take it away). Its made more so by the menacing red lights that come on when the power fails.Of course Nathan was creepy enough to begin with. Hes bald and heavily bearded a hipster in hiding. When hes not drunk he has a hangover or is working one off. He wont talk to Caleb about the nuts and bolts of his work as it were (the materials are more high-tech than that). He just wants to hang out. And dance.In one hilariously insane scene Nathan and Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) -- Nathans assistant or servant or sexual partner or some combination of all of those -- hit the dance floor with gusto in a makeshift disco. (This compound has room for everything.) Is Nathan nuts? Oh yeah no question. Thats not even an issue. What is an issue is just how nuts.Isaac is terrific never revealing much of his character except for a highly intelligent undefined menace and thats terrifying. Gleeson also is outstanding. His Caleb doesnt know everything thats going on but he knows enough that Ava is intriguing and desirable -- and a robot -- and that Nathan is watching and listening the whole time. Gleeson excels at portraying both the intellectual and emotional sides of Caleb whose excitement slowly turns to confusion and fear.But best of all is Vikander. Ava is after all a robot so thats a challenge to play. But shes more than that. Vikander infuses her with a yearning a longing ... for what? To no longer be alone? Or at least not be alone with Nathan? Or does she want something more for herself?Well that would be the answer to the test wouldnt it? You can discover that for yourself. But however it works out with ""Ex Machina"" Garland passes with flying colors.Ex Machina4.5 stars (out of 5) Director Alex Garland.Cast Alicia Vikander Domhnall Gleeson Oscar Isaac.Rating R for graphic nudity language sexual references and some violence.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

At its center -- baffling unsettling and infinitely intriguing -- is a robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander) the creation of a wealthy genius scientist/entrepreneur named Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Ava is literally transparent her mechanical innards visible through clear plastic skin. Writer-director Alex Garland and the pictures production team have through the use of CGI conceived and constructed an amazing-looking entity in Ava. Movie Review    Ex Machina with Domhnall Gleeson Oscar Isaac Alicia Vikander Sonoya Mizuno. Written and directed by Alex Garland. 108 minutes. Rated R for graphic nudity language sexual references and some violence. Several theaters. Yet there is much of Ava that is hidden. She is a walking talking enigma. Behind the lovely expressive human mask grafted onto her mechanical head lies a hyperadvanced man-made brain. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

But how close? Nathan recruits one of his top programmers a geeky young fellow named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) to administer the so-called Turing test to find out whether her intelligence matches or perhaps exceeds that of human beings. The setting of this experiment is a remote forest fortress bought and built by Nathans megamillions a place of opulence and austerity of featureless gray concrete walls and pricey furnishings. Its a perfect hideout for reclusive eccentric Nathan. The performances are extraordinary with Vikanders being the most remarkable. She plays Ava with a Mona Lisa smile -- inscrutable yet mesmerizing -- and a voice that is preternaturally calm yet oddly seductive. Gleesons Caleb is a loner and lonely. Hes attracted to Avas intelligence and bewitched by her undeniable allure. As he falls under her spell he comes to question the nature of humanity -- not only of Avas (possible) humanity but of his own. Isaac coming off his highly praised performance in ""A Most Violent Year"" once again does terrific work. His Nathan creator of a search engine thats made him enormously wealthy has the kind of intimidating arrogance of a Steve Jobs. He clearly believes hes the smartest guy on the planet and is comfortable playing God both with his creation Ava and with his employee Caleb. Garlands conception and handling of this material is close to flawless. Its hard to believe this is his first directorial effort. A novelist (""The Beach"") turned screenwriter (""28 Days Later"" ""Sunshine"" both directed by Danny Boyle) and clearly a man of great intelligence hes made one of the most memorable science-fiction movies in recent memory.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday April 16 2015 Follow AnnHornaday Directed by Alex Garland ""Ex-Machina"" is a thriller starring Oscar Isaac Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander. (  / A24 Films) To most speculative fiction fans Alex Garland is best known as the novelist behind ""The Beach"" and the screenwriter behind ""28 Days Later"" and ""Never Let Me Go."" With ""Ex Machina"" Garland makes an impressive debut as a director spinning an unsettling futuristic thriller with the expertise and exquisite taste of a seasoned veteran. Among Garlands virtues is an impeccable sense of how to get a story moving Within the first few minutes of ""Ex Machina"" weve met Caleb an eager young computer programmer played by Domhnall Gleeson and observed his overjoyed reaction at winning a week-long stay at the secluded estate of his legendary boss Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Traveling by private helicopter over acres of lush forests and waterfalls he asks the pilot when theyll get to Nathans property only to be informed theyve been flying over it for the past two hours. Nathan who invented a Google-like search engine called Blue Book lives like a New Age mad mountain king ensconced in a pristine modernist aerie set into the rock face of a hillside. Anyone would be dazzled and Caleb is doubly thrilled when he learns why hes been summoned Out of hundreds of Blue Book employees he has been chosen to conduct a ""Turing test"" in which he is tasked with matching wits with an artificial intelligence machine Nathan has constructed in order to judge whether it possesses genuine human consciousness. Nathan (Oscar Isaac) left invites Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) into his world in ""Ex Machina."" (A24) Of course the Turing test is also known by another name. But if Nathan had asked Caleb ""Have you heard of the imitation game?"" that would have invited an unwelcome digression about last years Academy Awards race. Garland effectively erases any and all memories of the Alan Turing biopic instead calling on references as wide-ranging as ""Alice in Wonderland"" ""Frankenstein"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" to create an absorbing often disquieting contemporary parable. It complicates matters at first only somewhat -- but then a whole lot -- that Nathans A.I. comes in the form of a pretty animatronic woman named Ava. Played by the Danish actress Alicia Vikander with sensitivity and precise balletic movements this metal-limbed beauty blurs the lines between artifice and authentic emotion in ways that will ultimately do a number on both Caleb and her charismatic manipulative inventor. [In ""The Imitation Game"" Benedict Cumberbatch passes the test as Turing] Filmed in a spectacular private home and neighboring eco-hotel in Norway ""Ex Machina"" has been handsomely designed the leafy green natural environment coexisting in Zenlike balance with the glass steel and blue-glowing neon of Nathans lair and laboratory. His head shaved and sporting a generous beard Isaac embodies his cerebral-hipster alpha male with a carefully calibrated mixture of warmth and menace One minute hes bro-ing down with Caleb the next hes an inebriated belligerent bully. (And in one delightfully surreal sequence hes giving ""Saturday Night Fever""-era John Travolta a run for his money on the dance floor.) As the audiences proxy Gleeson brings just the right amount of naivete and openness to a character who becomes so unsure of whats real that he resorts to extreme methods. There are more than a few dollops of body horror in ""Ex Machina"" which winds up veering into pop revenge pulp. But even at its bloodiest the film succeeds at ratcheting up the mood of quiet unease provocatively engaging everything from intimacy identity and agency to such hot-button issues as corporate surveillance sexual orientation and male privilege. The fact that so many questions can be addressed by way of a tautly constructed triad -- and that each of the three principals is such a clearly delineated vivid character in his or her own right -- is a testament to Garlands original concept the lucidity of his execution and to the superb actors who bring it to such chillingly convincing life. ""Ex Machina"" is a smart exceptionally stylish head trip. R. At Angelika Film Center Mosaic and ArcLight Bethesda.

"Ex Machina review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Ex Machina Ex-Machina A Films Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac in a scene from the film ""Ex-Machina."" Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac in a scene from the film ""Ex-Machina."" (A Films) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Or She Robot. A grandly ridiculous theatrical tradition born in ancient Greece deus ex machina meant literally a god borne by a machine descending from the sky to determine a storys outcome.The hardware in writer-director Alex Garlands crafty new thriller ""Ex Machina"" signifies something a little less clunky and considerably more ambiguous. In this case the object of adoration is a superadvanced example of artificial intelligence. The hook hardly new is this Can A.I. be made not simply to mimic human behavior and outthink us intellectual weaklings but to develop consciousness of its own no longer subject to our control? Films as disparate as ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" ""Westworld"" ""Blade Runner"" (derived from Philip K. Dicks ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"") and the blithely comic ""Her"" have answered that question in different shades of wonder and terror.Extend the theme to alien beings as did the recent ""Under the Skin"" and the notion of humanness becomes perplexingly fluid. More fixed for better or worse is the male fantasy aspect of this trope which has been around ever since Pygmalion carved his dream date out of marble. No marble here. The eerie figure at the center of ""Ex Machina"" has fiber-optic cables for tendons and emits a peculiar little digital hum each time she takes a step. Garland whose screenwriting credits include ""28 Days Later"" ""Never Let Me Go"" and the undervalued science fiction outing ""Sunshine"" relies on three primary characters in ""Ex Machina"" and a simple dominant setting that of a remote mountainside home owned by the insanely wealthy founder of a Google-like search engine firm.Sporting a closely shaved head and a beard that screams ""iconoclast plus danger"" Oscar Isaac plays this elusive visionary Nathan who has not been seen by anyone in his vast company for years. In quick artful strokes the film opens with Caleb the shy programmer portrayed by Domhnall Gleeson learning hes won a company lottery that will whisk him to spend a magical week with Nathan. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. Once Nathan introduces Caleb to Ava the female A.I. played by Swedish-born former ballerina Alicia Vikander the purpose of Calebs visit is revealed. He is to take part in an experiment to determine the authenticity of Ava whatever that may mean. Nathans itching to get out of the prototype phase of his next big thing. Does Ava have a humanlike consciousness? Does she have a soul? Is she touchy about being sidelined the way her spiritual cousin HAL 9000 became in ""2001""?I like the way Garland scales things in ""Ex Machina"" which was made for a modest 13 million and looks terrific sleek and stylishly ominous every second. Weird little humorous flourishes keep us engaged such as Gleesons startled reaction to a photo-ID session or Isaacs dance break with his cryptic assistant played by Sonoya Mizuno. Alas the movie cannot resolve its story in any sort of surprising or truly fresh way. Wheres a good old-fashioned deus ex machina capper when you need it? Its worth seeing nonetheless. Garland sidles up to some large ideas some more provocative than others and his premise hints at the costs of perpetual omnivorous surveillance. Not to take anything away from the performers but the real star of ""Ex Machina"" is sound designer Glenn Freemantle who came up with Avas digital footsteps and the gentle sound of artificial skin being removed from flexible high-grade metal. Such details matter especially when the big ideas arent so daisy fresh.""Ex Machina"" - 3 stars (out of four)MPAA rating R (for graphic nudity language sexual references and some violence)Running time 148Opens Thursday at AMC River East Landmark Century Cinema and Century Evanston 12Phillips is a Tribune critic.mjphillipstribpub.com Twitter phillipstribune Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Reviews Oscar Isaac Review The Longest Ride Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ex-machina-review-blade-runner-20150415-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,exmachina19,exmachina,chicagotribune

(AP Photo/A24 Films) Photo Associated Press Ex Machina is sci-fi with more than artificial intelligence 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Science fiction may be the defining movie genre of our time but too often its just a vehicle for escapist space adventure or paranoid dystopian fantasy. A sci-fi movie that actually has intelligent things to say about science -- thats all too rare. Its what we get in ""Ex Machina."" Human scale mind-stretching and eerie its the debut feature from the novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland (""The Beach"" ""28 Days Later""). For his first time in the directors chair Garland goes easy on himself creating what is essentially a chamber piece with only four main characters. Yet working within these constraints Garland shows an uncommon command of tone. In ""Ex Machina"" Garland balances absurdist humor with the throb of imminent disaster and just a hint of forlorn romanticism. Its hard to imagine another director squeezing as many shades and colors from his screenplay as Garland did and from now on it would be understandable if he insisted on directing everything he writes. The inevitability of real artificial intelligence is the subject with Domhnall Gleeson as Caleb a computer coder who wins a contest to stay for one week at the home of his boss a tech superstar. When he was 13 Nathan (Oscar Isaac) created Blue Book which in the world of ""Ex Machina"" is the biggest search engine in the world with 94 percent of Internet search traffic. Now he lives in a lavish underground compound a two-hour helicopter ride from his nearest neighbor working on experiments that can redirect the course of human life. Isaac has been on a fast track to stardom since Madonna cast him in a major role in ""W.E."" three years ago. He has grown with every opportunity and he gave one of the best performances of 2014 in ""A Most Violent Year"" but in ""Ex Machina"" he has something extra the glow and confidence of a movie star. To see him here is to have for the first time a sense of his doing something that might be called ""an Oscar Isaac role"" playing someone charming relentless and mysterious. After persuading Caleb to sign a nondisclosure agreement that basically allows him to spy on the poor guy for the rest of his life Nathan reveals his purpose He has been working on a robot that he believes has true consciousness not simulated consciousness and he wants Caleb to meet ""Ava"" to ask her questions and to see if he agrees. Ava is a robot with the shape and voice of a woman and with a human face hands and feet. The rest of her looks like a machine and the joining of metal and flesh looks almost grotesque and yet not quite. For the role of Ava Garland wisely cast Alicia Vikander a young Swedish actress with a face of such feeling and delicacy that we are aware of a sensate human-like force despite the metal plate she has in place of hair. The title derives from the Latin phrase ""deus ex machina"" (""god from the machine"") and invites the viewer to contemplate a possible world in which the gods -- in this case human inventors -- are no longer necessary and the machines are on their own. Like ""Frankenstein"" it presents the spectacle of human-created intelligence and then asks what that would mean in spiritual terms. Can artificial life have a soul? Or (horror of horrors) would the mere fact of artificial intelligence prove theres no such thing as the soul? On more practical terms the movie gives us a blueprint for how an artificial consciousness might be created using search engine data to discover not just what people are thinking but how people think. In such moments ""Ex Machina"" makes the future feel close at hand as in too close -- as in something we should probably start worrying about now.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 754am on Friday Apr. 17 2015 Friday Apr. 17 2015 Wednesday Apr. 15 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Thoughtful science fiction is as rare in film these days as black-and-white or a double feature something parents fascinate their children with as exotica from a different moviegoing time.First-time director Alex Garland brilliantly brings the past into the present with the near-future tale Ex Machina a stark but dazzling meditation on intelligence consciousness and morality that discreetly uses special effects in service of story dialogue and character. What a concept.Oscar Isaac ( A Most Violent Year Inside Llewyn Davis) is Nathan a Steve Jobs-like tech tycoon who lives in beautiful isolation somewhere at the edge of the world the location of which is never named. But hes not just relaxing. Nathan has big ideas and gives one of his employees the opportunity to spend several days working with him at his compound.Thats how low-level Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson Unbroken) finds himself inside Nathans sleek surroundings feeling out of his depth and comfort zone. He discovers that Nathan has created artificial intelligence in the form of a female robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander Seventh Son) and has brought him there to test Ava to see how she responds to a human who is not her creator.The relationship among the three of them is what makes Ex Machina spark as it veers from inquisitive to controlling to sexual to hostile as they feel each other out. The film ripples with unpredictably as the viewer is kept guessing about motivations and outcome until the final frame.Garland best-known as a novelist (The Beach) and screenwriter (28 Days Later) deals with big issues and big ideas about life and living so the dialogue-heavy Ex Machina could have been as subtle as a bag of hammers. But his script elegantly dances around such pitfalls and ultimately echoes the feel of the best episodes of such classic TV series as The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits. There are even welcome touches of sly humor; Isaacs dance scene alone is enough for the price of admission.The performances are outstanding from Isaac as a man who may be teetering on the edge of madness to Gleeson as a callow young man finding his voice and Vikander as someone coming into her own.Also worth noting is the films look Garland and cinematographer Rob Hardy have created a seductively claustrophobic world and Avas appearance -- at once appealingly human and coldly robotic -- is a marvel. Ex Machina may not just turn out to be one of the best science-fiction films of the year but one of the best films period.

"Ex Machina | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ex-machina ) Ex Machina (United Kingdom 2015) April 15 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Artificial Intelligence has always been a common science fiction theme.  The Frankenstein-influenced concept of a human being giving life to a new entity - one that can think and act independently - has teased writers with its potential. Now as we move deeper into the 21st century and technology speeds forward at a breakneck pace the gap between the fiction in this concept and its parallel reality is closing.  Perhaps this is one reason why there has been an uptick in the number of movies with Artificial Intelligence as a plot point. The field isnt yet overcrowded (and considering the richness of the subject matter it may never be) but Ex Machina joins Her and Chappie as recent films that have explored these ideas. One of the most persistent and compelling questions about artificial intelligence is what it entails. At what point is consciousness achieved? When does an entity transcend the ability to do nothing more than follow complex programming and begin to think on its own? At what point does a machine cease to be a tool and earn the status of a ""life form""? These questions lie at the heart of many stories about this subject matter and Ex Machina is no exception. Although the movie is principally about two human beings the most intriguing character by far is the robot at narratives center. Her name is Ava (Alicia Vikander) and she is the latest in a line of A.I. prototypes developed by genius computer scientist and noted recluse Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). Bateman the CEO of the worlds biggest search engine company runs a competition among his employees with the winner earning the right to spend a week with him at his remote estate. The lucky selectee is Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) but he doesnt learn until he reaches his destination that Nathan intends for Calebs stay to involve more than conversation and observation. He wants Caleb to participate in a Turing Test - to interact with Ava and determine whether she can pass for a human. Caleb is astonished by how real Ava seems - so much so that he begins to wonder about the morality of Nathans interactions with her. Calebs feelings for Ava appear to be matched by hers for him but is she truly experiencing emotions or merely mimicking them? And is he in control of the situation or is Nathan acting like a puppeteer pulling not only Avas strings but Calebs as well? Ex Machina avoids the trap of becoming too technical. The storyline is straightforward and doesnt involve a lot of technobabble. Nathan doesnt spend excessive time explaining how he created Ava although he mentions (to Calebs dismay) that she will eventually be ""killed"" to make way for the next more advanced prototype. To Nathan creator-god these machines are no different from any other advanced computer. Hes interested in perfecting them but doesnt see them as unique life forms. To Caleb the outsider the truth is more fluid and Nathans actions more questionable. This is not an action-oriented science fiction film and while some special effects are employed they are limited and mostly low-budget. (Ironically Gleeson and Isaac moved from this production to the new Star Wars film where words like ""limited"" and ""low-budget"" dont apply.) Ex Machina focuses primarily on evolving its themes through interaction (between Caleb and Ava) and dialogue. The movie is broken into several ""acts"" each of which focuses on a session between Caleb and Ava who are separated by a clear wall - they can see each other and talk but not touch. Everything is monitored and Nathan looks on from afar evaluating and judging. Director Alex Garland (the writer of several Danny Boyle films making his feature debut behind the camera) builds a restless unsettled tone. Aspects of the ending strain credulity while simultaneously crystalizing the themes Ex Machina has evolved throughout its 108-minute running time. From a performance perspective the most impressive acting is provided by Alicia Vikander (the Swedish actress who was recently in Seventh Son) who captures Avas allure by presenting her as seemingly guileless with a difficult-to-pinpoint inhuman quality. Oscar Isaac plays a variation of the mad scientist role - more Dr. Moreau than Dr. Frankenstein. Nathan is unquestionably a genius but also quite possibly mad. Hes a narcissist with a god complex who can be by turns charming and chilling. Domhnall Gleeson whose star is rising interprets Caleb as a flat and uninteresting individual but that may be more a matter of Garlands intention than Gleesons portrayal. And there is a kind of weird chemistry between Gleeson and Vikander. Ex Machina employs fewer twists and one might expect although there are some surprises along the way. For the most part however Garland is less interested in playing games with his audiences expectations than he is inviting viewers to sit beside Caleb and evaluate Ava. In the final analysis the movie doesnt offer much about the subject that hasnt been previously explored but the soil is fertile and many ideas germinate. This is a cautionary tale about where technology could be leading and its low-key claustrophobic approach lends an immediacy that many bigger grander spectacles lack.

"Let There Be Light Juliette Binoche Is Luminous; Ex Machina Lacks Life. Plus Hallelujah You Can Survive The Longest Ride << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Let There Be Light Juliette Binoche Is Luminous; Ex Machina Lacks Life. Plus Hallelujah You Can Survive The Longest Ride IFC Movies April 10 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Clouds of Sils Maria makes you believe that a world-famous actress played by Juliette Binoche once did time as a villain in the X-Men movies. Not just any villain either but one who sounds like Doctor Nemesis a lean gentleman in a fedora who in every way is Binoches opposite. The movie makes you believe that Kristen Stewart playing the actresss assistant is Binoches equal as a performer and that shes perceptive and wise while Binoche is flighty and self-consumed. Their tandem is as much as you could ask for from acting that is subtle but not too subtle. Binoche and Stewart spend most of the movie in a two-way conversation and each woman seems to bring out something new in the other. That Stewart can keep up with Binoche is impressive but that she can think alongside her is exciting. The movie which Olivier Assayas wrote and directed is a world of wonders most of them cerebrally twisty and emotionally hallucinogenic. Hes thinking about youthfulness and age and self-reflection. The title refers to a rare sort of cloud that snakes through the valleys of the Swiss Alps portending rocky weather. The druggy way that cloud is presented here slithering toward the camera engulfing another character until shes sick is like a ghostly exhalation of something brewed in a bong. Here the turbulence is psychological. Binoches character Maria Enders is on her way to present an old Swiss playwright friend Wilhelm Melchior with a literary prize. On the train to Zurich her assistant Valentine (or Val) gets a call telling her the friend has died. The timing is strange since Maria has just been invited to join a revival of Maloja Snake a play by Melchior about a younger woman named Sigrid who fills her older boss Helena with suicidal lust. It seems like a terrible show. But as a younger actress Maria had made an artistic breakthrough playing Sigrid. Now shes reluctantly going to play Helena. In any case the role would be a creative risk. Shes had enough of acting with wires as she puts it but has reservations about acting without nets too. Returning to this play opposite the role that made her reputation means accepting that shes no longer an ingenue. That sounds like tired old actorly vanity Am I too old? And the situation raises some cinematic concerns Is this too Bergman? But it feels as if Assayass movie wants to rethink Bergmans X-rays of toxic intimacy in order to put Maria in battle with herself. The movie compounds her sense of vulnerability. Shes in the middle of a divorce. Her grabby old costar (Hanns Zischler) is back on the scene. And the actress playing her old role is a popular young American hothead named Jo-Ann (Chloe Grace Moretz having a sneering blast) who also comes to this play hot off a superhero movie. Maria gives in to the temptation to Google her. She and Val find bratty Jo-Ann press conferences naughty talk-show appearances and an amusingly inane clip from one of the comic-book films. (One thing Assayas cant make you believe is that the hottest young actress on the planet is named Jo-Ann.) Running the plays lines with Val who does Sigrid provides confusion where clarity is presumed. They hole up in an Alpine bungalow and go over the scenes unpacking meaning. All Maria does is defend the plays essence but even for her its unfixed. Val cant understand why Maria wont simply accept what shes become older. This is vertiginously European and yet Assayas doesnt overdress it in formalism. If he had shot this like a Bergman movie with the conjoined-twin blocking and the suffocating and uninflected sharing of frames Sils Maria would be unbearable. Itd be karaoke. Instead Assayas plants the claustrophobia in Marias head. For the line-running scenes Maria gets a rather amazing haircut that doubly corresponds to masculinized femininity and Peter Pan delusions. Indeed contrary to her misgivings about the phoniness of superhero movies she flies around the house and the backyard like a woman happily acquainted with wires. The text of the play brings out the subtext of Maria and Vals relationship which carries a current of attraction. They debate the meaning of it all until they reach a credible intellectual impasse Val doesnt feel that Maria respects her reading. Maybe Maria doesnt. Shes too caught up in her neuroses to value a second opinion. How can such a bad play -- one that loosely sounds like the plot for 2010s Love Crime a lousy psychosexual thriller with Kristin Scott Thomas and Ludivine Sagnier -- bring out such smart screenwriting and instinctive acting? It turns out that as characters and actors Binoche and Stewart are unexpectedly ideal scene partners. Binoche is the sort of star who can find harmony with almost anyone in any language. Shes luminous in everything -- but shes the only star Ive ever seen who can so specifically adjust the wattage. For Flight of the Red Balloon she was luminously unstable. For Certified Copy she was luminously romantic. For Assayas she turns herself inside out so completely so contradictorily (and yes so luminously) that you wonder whether Binoche herself is looking for the same answers as Maria. Shes weary vital angry warm exhilarated engaged and aloof. I think that brightness blinds people to the brilliance of her actual talent. Light upstaging light Most actors should be so lucky. Whats surprising about the combination of her and Stewart is how much the older woman (Binoche is 51) appears to enjoy working with the younger one (Stewart is 25) -- not maternally either. That could just be acting but it seems like more than professionalism. Its transference. Binoche makes Stewart appear to be her equal. And after seeing them act together here you leave thinking maybe she is. For a while it seemed as if she were going to try to get by in every performance on sulky attitude (thats what Moretz does; here it happens to work). But even in a couple of those Twilight movies -- the first and fourth -- Stewart has Jennifer Jason Leighs ballsiness. It doesnt seem like shes faking her way through a movie anymore. Shes building performances in smart ways -- by observation and collaboration. Being good seems to interest her more than being a star. Stewart sneaks through the back door for every line delivery. Theres a womanly husk in her voice. When she speaks its with some jadedness and a bit of warmth. She has a way of communicating that shes hearing the other person in the scene. That skill for listening is what made her so good as Julianne Moores daughter in Still Alice though here the effect is different. Val and Maria are acting partners and theorists arguing for their respective understanding of the text. When Val tells Maria that theater is an ""interpretation of life that can be truer than life itself"" Stewart has to say it the way certain 24-year-olds would. She makes it sound neither unduly wise nor highfalutin -- just according to her true. Clouds of Sils Maria is Assayass latest personal entertainment-industry salvo (Irma Vep from 1997 and Demonlover from 2002 are two others). This one has the right harmony among the different worlds and texts (context subtext pretext text-text) so that it works not only as a movie but also as a running commentary on itself. It opens itself up for different readings. (Ive heard more than one person suggest that Val is a figment.) As a filmmaker hes too catholic in his interests to have a single preoccupation. But thematic ambition and lack of interest in narrative convention characterize nearly all of his narrative features. (The 2010 miniseries terrorism epic Carlos might be the best-known project.) Clouds of Sils Maria is another movie that presents artistic integrity as a matter of life and death. Like Birdman it stages that presentation as a confrontation between the mass commerce of superhero movies and the allegedly naked truth of the stage. Assayass movie is an elegant counterpoint to that movies caffeinated insecurities and macho poetry. You dread seeing the play in either movie. But Birdman cops out on it anyway. It becomes an ephemeral plea for a last stroke of the ego. Assayas uses it to take stock of a womans soul. For him the plays always the thing.  Universal Pictures The opening scenes of Ex Machina give you what you want from a movie They hypnotize. In a perfectly edited series of dreamlike images a software programmer named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) discovers that hes won a contest that gets him loaded onto a helicopter and dropped into the middle of a remote hunk of verdant lushness where a cottage of enviable high design (glass concrete glass marble etc.) has been tucked into the landscape. The owner of the house is a billionaire technologist named Nathan (Oscar Isaac) who owns the company Caleb works for. He takes Caleb down into the vast basement which is part bunker part boutique hotel part lab and which is plagued with unexplained power outages. We dont know whats going on. Neither does Caleb really. Nathan has him sign a nondisclosure agreement and the security card he gives his employee unlocks only some of the doors. The apprehension persists after Nathan presents his experiment to Caleb. Its an application of the Turing test in which Caleb is to determine whether the behavior of the robot that Nathan has devised -- a shapely figure called Ava -- is distinguishable from a human. At first the reason to go along with this is that the writer and director Alex Garland keeps the movie so full of doomy atmosphere that expecting the worst sort of becomes a treat. But gradually the hypnosis wears off the mystique dissipates and banalities take over. Nathan has a creepy-sexy housekeeper named Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) for instance and you can tell somethings up with her when Nathan berates her for breaking a dish or some glasses and she somehow fails to stab him in the neck with a shard. Garland is the novelist turned screenwriter of Danny Boyles very good science fiction movies (28 Days Later ...  Sunshine). This is his first film as a director. After a while you realize that he has relied entirely on mortifying atmosphere to get him through. The red hell lighting that crops up makes you feel like youre at one of the parties in Rosemarys Baby. Meanwhile something on Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrows effective electronic soundtrack is nearly always throbbing. You dont know whether to climb the walls or phone a cardiologist. Garland also adapted Kazuo Ishiguros novel about the inner lives of clones Never Let Me Go into a sleepy movie that thought the book was about their outer lives. Gleeson and Alicia Vikander who plays Ava pick up where the actors in that movie left off. In fairness Vikander doesnt have much of a choice. But for a creature thats passing the Turing test with flying colors her hints at sentient humanness cry out for their own Turing experiment. The performances stiffen further as a horror movie pools around them. Isaac is wonderful though. He has the beard that Robert De Niro used to play Satan in Angel Heart and the swagger that Al Pacino probably uses to load the dishwasher. Hes permitted to work with abandon here. The best scene in the movie has him and Mizuno disco dancing in sync to Oliver Cheathams ""Get Down Saturday Night"" a song that deserves to replace ""Got to Give It Up"" as the movies atmospheric party jam. Isaac is actually too wonderful. His whatever-dude insouciance takes the menace out of the movie. Garland needs the noise and lights to keep you on edge because his villain has too much creative leeway. His evil sleaziness never reaches full-on psychotic. But maybe Isaac was looking for a way out of a cliche. I for one am always disappointed when all that movie nerds can think to do with their genius their god complex and their Gs is to take a rib and build an Ava. (Or a Kyoko -- walking talking Fleshlights.) Based on the heartless territory the movie stakes out Garland too might be tired of this. But 90 minutes of male fantasy and 10 of alleged feminism are bad math. Ex Machina feels like the work of someone who felt the best way to make Frankenstein was to watch a lot of porn.  Twentieth Century Fox Clouds of Sils Maria and Ex Machina are either entirely or partially contingent upon art. So is The Longest Ride which is not at all about the Tour de France. Its based on a Nicholas Sparks novel in which a North Carolina cowboy has to consider giving up the rodeo because his aspiring-gallerist girlfriend (and his physician) thinks its bad for his health. Also because some sentimental old Jewish guy kind of says so. The movie lasts for more than two hours. Its full of bunk and even more full of flashbacks. The young lovers are anonymous-looking -- shes a perky blonde; he squints -- but theyre still likable. The painter Willem de Kooning makes a special appearance while the unridable bull Rango makes several (playing himself). I like the campy judgments of these Sparks movies. Theyre like having a reverend do a puppet show to explain sin. This one has that. But its got a sexiness that rarely comes through in these movies. Britt Robertson plays the girl Sophia. Scott Eastwood plays the guy Luke. (Eastwood is Clints son so the squinting comes honestly.) And when he kisses her -- well he evidently knows how. At the movies that is a Halleys Comet-level event. Eastwood seems like he was raised by surfers not farmers but whats the point in arguing? When he trudges past in a cowboy hat and boots plaid shirt tucked into jeans and flowers in his hands people stare like hes also a centaur. The plot wouldnt pass a safety inspection. Luke and Sophia rescue a man named Ira (Alan Alda) and his letters from the car he crashed on the side of a road. They take him to the hospital and for reasons that are inadequately explained his vision is bad and Sophia winds up reading him the letters which he wrote. This means the movie has to go all the way back to the 1940s and inch its way toward the 21st century. For long passages we watch young Ira (Jack Huston) woo Ruth (Oona Chaplin) then marry her then fail to give her children (thanks WWII battle injury). As a schoolteacher shes beatific about it until she can no longer keep her maternity on standby. He lavishes her with art -- De Koonings Ellsworth Kellys and a Jacob Lawrence -- and she loves him for it. But that impoverished parentless kid in her class is starting to look like a pretty good addition to the collection. Why conventional adoption fails for these nice rich people is also conveniently underexplained. If the reason is anti-Semitism speak The blandness afoot is a change of pace for the director George Tillman Jr. whose other movies include Soul Food and the Biggie Smalls biopic Notorious. (He also produced Barbershop Beauty Shop and Roll Bounce.) This is to say that theres a heartbreaking honesty in Lukes decision to serve Sophia barbecue from plastic bags and Styrofoam Why pretend? The plot switches back and forth until everything else is made clear enough for a series of surprises that almost choked me up. Luke learns that theres more to life than staying on a bull at a rodeo. By ""more"" I mean Sophia who has learned everything before the movie starts which is how she has so much time for Luke. The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations. This is one of the few you can ride for longer than eight seconds.

But the movies have tended to side with the robots the (sometimes literally) scrappy underdogs whose desires for survival and autonomy feel even more fundamentally human than the rush from hugging a puppy. Landing somewhere in between absolute terror and empathy is ""Ex Machina"" a fairly simple parable about AI with several entertaining twists and turns along the way. Screenwriter Alex Garland (""28 Days Later"" ""Sunshine"") makes a promising directorial debut with a gorgeously conceived if lethargically paced take on the Bluebeard fairy tale generously peppered with both familiar AI-movie tropes and fresh discussions about what advantages and experiences artificially intelligent beings deserve. See Video Oscar Isaac Is Erasing the Line Between Man and Machine in First Ex Machina Trailer (Video) The result is a chilly yet engrossing drama elevated beyond its four-people-locked-in-a-house framework by the eerie beauty of the production design and the thoughtful curiosity of Garlands screenplay. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) arrives at the remote mansion of his bosss bosss boss Nathan (Oscar Issac) a paranoid tech prodigy whose mannered attempt to be just one of the guys fails to put his shocked-and-awed underling at ease. Caleb has been chosen at random Nathan insists to test out ""the greatest scientific discovery in the history of man."" That linchpin of humanity turns out to be Ava (Alicia Vikander) a glowing metal-plated semi-hollow automaton with the face of an angel. Shes still a bit stiff sure but Calebs the only person shes ever interacted with other than her inventor and her perfect posture is probably an improvement on the human spine anyway. Also Read Harrison Ford Gave Oscar Isaac Piloting Advice on Star Wars Set (Video) Despite Nathans excitement about what Ava represents he treats her with cruel indifference. She in turn seems to loathe her maker. Aware that shes monitored by Nathans cameras all day long Ava arranges to steal a few moments here and there between polite chitchat with Caleb about their favorite colors and childhood memories to warn the lowly programmer not to trust his employer. Avas questions about the beta versions of herself - whose sculpted empty faces line the walls of Nathans cavernous highly secured house - lead Caleb to suspect that his new robotic acquaintance might be headed for the recycle bin soon. The more time he spends with Ava - who begins to express romantic feelings for Caleb - the more he becomes convinced that he needs to rescue her from her inventor especially after discovering Nathans monstrous collection of sexually fetishized robot cadavers. Ratcheting up the ick-factor the inventor lets Caleb know that Avas capable of sex - why shouldnt she get to feel physical pleasure just because shes made of silicon and wires? - but it soon turns out that theres an ominous reason why the lowly programmer finds himself mutually smitten with the robot. Also Read Alicia Vikander to Join Michael Fassbender in Light Between Oceans Eddie Redmayne in Danish Girl The plot takes a few more narrative bends after that some of them surprising but none of them affecting. The rest of the film coasts on visual flair which flirts with dismemberment porn (though I confess to being more squeamish than perhaps the average viewer when it comes to mutilated bodies). More egregiously if most AI movies fall into the trap of overly sentimentalizing nonhuman characters then ""Ex Machina"" goes too far in the other direction doing too little to make Ava (and the films other female character Nathans racial caricature of a live-in maid played by Sonoya Mizuno) a person/thing worth caring about. If the robots of the future are this dull Hawking might have nothing to worry about. Watch the trailer below. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Both bright and bleak his work stands out in a genre often overrun by shiny toys and children. ""Ex Machina"" is his best yet. It also marks his debut as a director a tricky transition for a screenwriter. Just as former cinematographers sometimes settle for pretty pictures ex-writers often fixate on the words - forgetting about all the other important things that make up a film. But although ""Ex Machina"" is small and talky - it has just four characters and the only action comes at the end - it also looks good. The set direction is interesting and evocative. The effects impress but dont overwhelm. The story features Domhnall Gleeson as a techie who wins a week with his boss. Wow whats second prize? Two weeks? But Gleesons employer as played by Oscar Isaac is a mix of Steve Jobs Mark Zuckerberg and a James Bond villain. He lives in a remote underground mansion works out all day drinks all night and has built Ava a sexy thinking robot. And now he wants Gleeson to give her a test run. Its an uncertain start. Its not clear what Gleeson has won at first or how and Isaac is so aggressively unpleasant - with his shaved head Bushwick beard and oh-so-superior guru-speak - its not clear where this is going or even if we should go along. Until you realize this is really just a new twist on a classic horror story - ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" or ""Frankenstein."" Isaac is really the latest in a long line of monster-makers. And now he has to find out of his monster really works. His creation is played by Swedens Alicia Vikander whose slightly cold presence didnt help ""A Royal Affair"" or ""The Fifth Estate"" but is perfect for playing an artificially intelligent android. Looking a little like that fem-bot from the vodka ads she has an unfinished look - only her face hands and feet are covered in ""flesh"" - and a soft melancholy. Gleesons job is to administer the ""Turing test"" - to see if this machine is really indistinguishable from a human being - and so the film progresses as a series of conversations. First Gleeson speaks to Vikander trying to see how human and independently intelligent she is; then he argues with Isaac over what ""human"" and ""intelligence"" really mean. If it sounds idea and dialogue-driven - that screenwriter-turned-filmmaker trap again - at least the ideas and dialogue are interesting and well performed by the small cast. Isaac is annoying (but exactly in the way a billionaire nerd would be) Vikander a little otherworldly and Gleeson exploits his usual nice-guy awkwardness. And it takes place in a contained but intriguing location all opaque glass and rough rock walls and concrete floors. Attention has been paid to details (Avas movements are accompanied by a slight mechanical whirr) and the film delivers the requisite albeit restrained chills (previous robots hang in a wardrobe like empty suits). ""Ex Machine"" isnt just a good script. Its a real movie. And the arrival of a real director. Ratings note The film contains nudity strong language violence and alcohol abuse. Ex Machina (R) A24 (108 min.) Directed by Alex Garland. With Alicia Vikander Domhnall Gleeson Oscar Isaac. Now playing in New York.    1/2 Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com.

"Review Unnerving consideration of artificial intelligence in Ex Machina - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Unnerving consideration of artificial intelligence in Ex Machina Ex Machina Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Ex Machina starring Domhnall Gleeson Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Ex Machina starring Domhnall Gleeson Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Shes artificial but is her intelligence? A cat-and-mouse encounter with AI in Ex Machina Shrewdly imagined and persuasively made ""Ex Machina"" is a spooky piece of speculative fiction thats completely plausible capable of both thinking big thoughts and providing pulp thrills. But even saying that doesnt do this quietly unnerving film full justice.The compelling directorial debut for novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland ""Ex Machina"" is also an involving chamber drama featuring emotional moves and countermoves by a trio of individuals played by Domhnall Gleeson Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander. Except one of them just happens to be machine-made. The title ""Ex Machina"" comes from the Latin phrase deus ex machina translated as god from the machine. Its origins have to do with Greek drama but the reference here is to man playing god to the unthought-of complications involved in creating sentient life.------------FOR THE RECORD ""Ex Machina"" A review in the April 10 Calendar section of the sci-fi movie ""Ex Machina"" included a reference to a ""Touring test."" The correct spelling is Turing after Alan Turing the British mathematician who conceived the test. -- ------------ Stories about artificial intelligence are a frequent science fiction topic from Czech writer Karel Capeks 1920 play ""R.U.R."" (which coined the term ""robot"") to Spike Jonzes invisible ""Her."" But the lumbering image that the word ""robot"" conveys is all wrong for Ava stunningly played by Vikander a creature of otherworldly delicacy and beauty who intentionally doesnt look like AI weve seen before. Simultaneously naive and knowing she seems to be discovering the world right before our eyes. Ex Machina A24 Films Domhnall Gleeson appears in a scene from ""Ex Machina."" Domhnall Gleeson appears in a scene from ""Ex Machina."" (A24 Films) Before we get to Ava however we meet Caleb Smith expertly played by Gleeson who here combines a smidgen of savvy with his trademark open-faced innocence.Caleb works for Blue Book the worlds most successful Internet search engine and the film opens with his winning first prize in a company-wide lottery. Hes to spend a week with Blue Books brilliant and fabulously wealthy but reclusive CEO Nathan Bateman (Isaac) who lives such a removed life in the wilds of Alaska that you can helicopter for two hours over his property and still not reach his house.As played by the chameleon-like Isaac (""Inside Llewyn Davis"" ""A Most Violent Year"") Nathan is a formidable individual intimidating mentally physically and psychologically. With his buzz cut full beard and imposing physique the man is arrogant and self-involved. He clearly thinks he knows it all but does he and even if he does how completely can he be trusted? Sci-fi Ex Machina feels modern futuristic and classical at once Mark Olsen Three characters trapped in a house debating human consciousness may not sound like the most exciting backbone for a movie. Yet in ""Ex Machina"" the directing debut for writer Alex Garland that dry-sounding concept becomes the basis for a sci-fi thriller of sleek gleaming surfaces and impressive... Three characters trapped in a house debating human consciousness may not sound like the most exciting backbone for a movie. Yet in ""Ex Machina"" the directing debut for writer Alex Garland that dry-sounding concept becomes the basis for a sci-fi thriller of sleek gleaming surfaces and impressive... (Mark Olsen) Nathans compound (filmed in Norway) is not just a house; its a research facility filled with ""enough fiber optic cable to go to the moon and lasso it."" Living alone except for Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) an enigmatic Japanese servant who speaks no English Nathan has been working on creating artificial intelligence and now wants to put his creation to the test.So Caleb is there as it turns out to do a kind of Touring test (conceived of by the British mathematician of ""The Imitation Game"") on Nathans creation to determine whether Ava is capable of experiencing real emotions or just simulating them.One reason for the success of ""Ex Machina"" is that Ava herself in terms of design acting and technology is such a remarkable and compelling creation. Conceived by the comic book artist known as Jock her look combines shiny mesh with translucent material on her arms and torso that reveal the mechanism within. ""You can see that I am a machine"" is one of the first things Ava says to Caleb and after six months of post-production work by Andrew Whitehurst of VFX house Double Negative the films visual effects supervisor that edgy combination of human and machine is exactly what we see.None of the effects would function as persuasively as they do without the initial work of Swedish actress Vikander best known for that countrys Oscar-nominated ""A Royal Affair."" In addition to being a fine actress Vikander is trained as a ballerina so shes capable of unsettlingly precise movements that convincingly position her as a combination of human and machine.""Ex Machina"" is structured around a series of daily conversation sessions that Caleb has with Ava in a glass-walled observation room increasingly intimate chats that Nathan eavesdrops on via closed circuit cameras.As these two chat banter even flirt their emotional connection strengthens which raises any number of tantalizing questions. What are the implications the responsibilities the consequences of getting emotionally involved with a machine?Garland has written science fiction screenplays before (""Sunshine"" ""28 Days Later"" the adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguros ""Never Let Me Go"") and he is completely at home in the genre. It was for instance his idea that Avas intelligence comes from Nathans ability to hack into all of the worlds digital devices.Even more impressive given that this is his directing debut is Garlands ability to keep the film quiet yet intensely involving. A scene of Ava putting on clothes is as erotically charged as someone taking them off in a more conventional feature.Garland has also hired all the right people including cinematographer Rob Hardy editor Mark Day and production designer Mark Digby. The films aural element combining sound design by ""Gravity"" Oscar winner Glenn Freemantle with a score by Geoff Barrow of Portishead and Ben Salisbury is calculated to keep us off balance and unsettled from beginning to end. In a film like ""Ex Machina"" thats just the way it should be.kenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Entertainment Movies Literature Trailer Ex Machina SXSW 2015 Of humans and robots in sci-fi chamber drama Ex Machina Sci-fi Ex Machina feels modern futuristic and classical at once Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-ex-machina-review-20150410-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,exmachina26,exmachina,latimes

A24 Films hide caption toggle caption A24 Films Sonoya Mizuno and Alicia Vikander in Ex-Machina. A24 Films The latest British movie to play the imitation game Ex Machina is the directorial debut of novelist-screenwriter Alex Garland. This time the stakes are higher than the Nazi conquest of Europe. The talky sci-fi puzzler turns on nothing less than the potential displacement of humans by artificially intelligent cyborgs. Then again maybe the film is just another riff on the battle of the sexes. The movies title abbreviates deus ex machina Latin for ""god from a machine."" (Its a reference to ancient Greek plays where a god character materialized at the end to put everything right.) In Garlands scenario the god is Nathan (Oscar Isaac) the tech prodigy who launched and controls Bluebook a fictional mashup of Google Facebook and a nongovernmental NSA. The machine is Ava (Alicia Vikander) devised by Nathan much the way another startup founder invented Eve. Ava sports a synthetic frame thats mostly see-through but covered and curvy in all the right places. She has sex appeal but does she have consciousness? Determining that is the assignment of the third main character Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) a Bluebook coder. If Nathan is approximately a god and Ava transparently a goddess Caleb is the patsy. The most sweeping assertion of Avas importance comes from the bushy-bearded Nathan who has summoned Caleb to a remote house/research lab nestled in a Nordic wilderness. Nathan seems to live entirely alone in this prison-like abode which may explain why hes a little batty and often drunk. Eventually though he introduces an unspeaking geisha-like servant Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno). (Is she an android too? Dont overthink your answer.) Nathan asks Caleb to conduct a Turing test on Ava to determine if she has achieved true intelligence. Of course the original Turing interrogation involved a computer thats hidden from the questioner not an alluring replicant who openly flirts with him. To his credit Garland addresses the implausibility of his scenario and allows Nathan to explain why he mated AI with erotic robotics. Theres much debate of individual versus collective identity and of thought versus instinct. The writer whose previous scripts include Sunshine and Never Let Me Go even includes a brief lecture on Jackson Pollock -- a moment that announces the films Europeanness as surely as its minimalist look and abundant female nudity. Since Ex Machina consists mostly of dialogues between Caleb and Ava or Nathan it has plenty of time to discuss the narrative options. There are only three 1) Ava has been cunningly programmed to appear capable of thought. 2) She is actually thinking and is also sincerely fond of Caleb. 3) Shes a conniving liar which would mean she really is smart. None of these possibilities is likely to lead to a startling payoff but the movie is reasonably diverting until its predictable (and predictably misogynistic) outcome. Isaac offers an intense and literally pumped-up variation on his customary role as the super-confident highly motivated outsider. The waifish Gleeson flickers believably between arrogance and self-doubt. As a creature who may be either puppet or puppetmaster Vikander is suitably elusive and fascinating. Still the movie is less a drama than an exercise in style. It relies heavily on the epic Norwegian exteriors the willowy actresses -- both Vikander and Mizuno are former ballerinas -- and Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrows buzzing skittering score. For all its chatter about intelligence Ex Machina is better at being than thinking.

Thats no small achievement. At one moment the movie has us guessing about the motives of Ava a beautiful robot played hypnotically by Alicia Vikander.

The collision tends not to go well. Whether its the adrenalized zombie apocalypse of 28 Days Later the doomed space mission of Sunshine or the chilling alternative reality of Never Let Me Go he seems to regard humanity with the same rueful skepticism that genre predecessors Michael Crichton and Philip K. Dick once did. Now in his directorial debut the visually sleek and intellectually knotty Ex Machina Garland turns his gimlet-eyed gaze toward the high-tech field of artificial intelligence. It too doesnt go well. Domhnall Gleeson who was last seen in Angelina Jolies Unbroken stars as Caleb Smith a slightly nerdy computer-programming whiz who works for BlueBook a Google-like search-engine giant run by a reclusive eccentric named Nathan Bateman (A Most Violent Years Oscar Isaac mischievously channeling the mad-genius trio of Steve Jobs Richard Branson and J.F. Sebastian the replicant designer from Blade Runner). Caleb wins a company-wide competition to be helicoptered to Nathans remote glass-and-concrete Bond-villain lair where his boss informs him that he will be the human component in a top secret Turing test--a series of interviews with Nathans latest AI creation Ava. And what a creation she (it?) is. Played by Swedish actress Alicia Vikander angelically peeking out from a mesh exoskeleton with an exposed midriff of blinking-circuit guts Ava is remarkably lifelike despite her C-3PO-as-sex-doll appearance. Her facial expressions are subtle her movements have balletic grace and her ache to be human is almost palpable. Nathan is rightfully proud of Ava and needs Caleb to interact with her in a series of one-on-one sessions and determine whether shes realistic enough to pass for human. Or at least thats what Nathan tells him. Like the hero of John Fowles 1965 novel The Magus Caleb soon discovers that hes not just involved in a science experiment hes the test subject--an unwitting lab rat in an architecturally groovy Skinner box hooked on Nathans pellets of friendship and flattery. And as Ava begins to flirt with and confide in him Caleb starts to question Nathans motives. Garlands cerebral setup is loaded with menacing promise and kinky possibility. But just when you find yourself settling in for a giddy brainteaser the story goes slack unraveling into a hash of familiar sci-fi themes (hubris the limits of consciousness creations rising up against their creators). As they say in screenwriting seminars--and in the corner suites of Hollywood studios--the movie has ""third-act problems."" Ex Machina is beautiful and ominous and features another delicately nuanced performance from Isaac whos quickly making a habit of them. But in the end for all of Garlands ambition his reach winds up exceeding his grasp. The film is as synthetic as Ava.

The excellent Domhnall Gleason is a computer programmer who wins a trip to the subterranean compound (an awe-inspiring assemblage of primordial boulders and glass partitions) of his overly chummy employer a multi-billionaire search-engine mogul played by Oscar Isaac. It appears that the boss-man has lassoed the moon by creating an artificial life form that might just might -- wait for it -- be both sentient and have a gorgeous fully functional female body. Gleason is supposed to take her for a test run so to speak. Her name is Ava and shes a piece of work. You couldnt recognize Isaac by looking at him. Hes short and beefy with a shaved head and thick black beard -- bottom-heavy. He has the same vocal rhythms as always though overdeliberate as if he took English As a Second Language from David Mamet. That diction is the giveaway that theres some kind of con going on. But what is his game? Alas it has nothing to do with presumably unique properties of the man-machine fusion known as the singularity and everything to do with James M. Cain and the noir-ish world of abusive husband-masters wily female slaves and poor-sap male ingenues. But Ava ... Ava ... Shes played by the 26-year-old Swede Alicia Vikander and shes one of the most creepily alluring creations in the annals of sci-fi. She wanders her glorified cage like a futuristic faun her lissome limbs transparent wires curling along her torso in the shape of a spine while a xylophone provides an ethereal plink. Vikander was a ballet dancer and she has what Mikhail Baryshnikov had in his too-brief career as an actor a lightness of tread a lift that makes you sure the normal rules of gravity dont apply to her. The movies design and special effects are indeed marvelous but what makes Ava amazing is all human.

Nathan oversees his empire from a remote scenic location. Hes simultaneously brilliant charming and infuriating with an underlying sense of ill-defined menace even when hes being friendly. USA TODAYAlicia Vikander is ideal in Ex MachinaAlicia Vikander plays his robotic creation Ava. Shes at once inquisitive knowing and innocent and Vikander nails the part with an alliance of subtle virtues wide eyes understated machine-like movements and an air of inscrutability.Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a good-natured programmer at Bluebook who wins an internal competition to spend a week with the big boss at HQ which is also Nathans sprawling home surrounded by dramatic waterfalls and woodsy solitude.Caleb is in awe of meeting Nathan especially in such pristine surroundings. Gleeson convincingly conveys Calebs awkward fascination.Shortly after he arrives however Caleb learns hes not there to bask in natures beauty or soak up what he can learn from his genius boss. Nathan explains that Caleb has been summoned to test the artificial intelligence of Ava an astounding creation with a luminous human face shiny chrome skull and artfully arranged translucent mesh-and-metal body. USA TODAYAlex Garland is a late bloomer in scienceCalebs assignment is to administer the ""Turing Test"" (developed by scientist/computer pioneer Alan Turing who moviegoers will remember from The Imitation Game). The test determines intelligent behavior equivalent to or indistinguishable from that of a human. So Calebs task is to assess Avas level of humanity in a series of interactions.He must also decipher the unnerving eccentric behavior of his host. For a first-time director Garland seems assured. His sharp sparse dialogue and meticulous direction are equally compelling and the trio of lead performances are top-notch.Vikander has a wise but dreamy quality as a robot determined to understand humans. Gleeson is the Everyman surrogate here the films emotional center who may be more than the computer geek he seems. And Isaac with his shaved head bushy beard and predilection for mass quantities of liquor is breathtaking in his ability to manipulate and keep Caleb -- and the audience -- off-guard.The films only flaw is in a fourth underdeveloped character Nathans assistant/girlfriend Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) whose arc becomes apparent too early.Striking production design adds to the films eeriness. Nathans custom-built home is sprawling and sleek but sterile and claustrophobic. Even the most ordinary events in this isolated manse feel excruciatingly tense. Garland infuses the film with a Hitchcock-like sense of dread that mounts throughout but never feels heavy-handed.An intricate twisty enigmatic tale Ex Machina unfolds at just the right pace and raises profound questions about the nature of humanity both real and fabricated. 71 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1yfyNOt",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/04/09/ex-machina-review/25410843/,200,exmachina34,exmachina,usatoday

Share Tweet You cant have consciousness without sex says Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac) reclusive billionaire genius as he sips Japanese beer on the top floor of his minimalist compound. Nathan founder of search engine giant Bluebook is a kind of hipster gym rat Dr. Moreau. Hes secluded himself here to a private estate the size of a small country to develop an artificial intelligence. Now a Bluebook employee Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) has been flown over to test the AI Ava (Alicia Vikander) a cutaway robot body that slinks and ticks and whirrs as she moves. With a lifelike face and hands made of synthetic skin she resembles a wind-up doll stripped of its wig and clothing the mechanism visible through her abdomen.Nathan and Caleb think that theyre playing God or maybe just Prometheus and sure enough like the fire bringer of Greek myth Nathan is punished through his liver. Isolated and maybe lonelier than he admits he gets blackout drunk every night and stumbles into his bedroom with the help of his perfect mute assistant Kyoko. Of course they arent really gods or even demigods. Theyre men trying to make a woman. A fantasy woman a dream girl--that is the sum total of all of their anxieties as enigmatic alluring and unpredictable as they imagine women to be. Maybe its subconscious; in all his years of trying Nathan has never thought to make his AI anything other than female. Ex Machina assembles this premise with a cleanness that brings to mind crisp speculative sci-fi prose before taking an arbitrary left turn into the territory of corny slasher thrillers. In other words its Sunshine all over again. First-time director Alex Garland wrote Sunshine and 28 Days Later for Danny Boyle as well as the novel that was adapted into Boyles The Beach which basically makes him a specialist in stories with rich ideas that are either undercut or canceled out by arbitrary endings. In that sense Ex Machina doesnt disappoint--or rather it disappoints in ways that are now predictable. While Ex Machinas ending isnt unmotivated (the title isnt foreshadowing as much as a critic might want it to be) it does fracture much of whats special about the movie. Up until the final scenes Garland creates and sustains a credible atmosphere of unease and scientific speculation defined by color-coded production design--neutral tones contrasted with the green of the woodland outside the compound and with bursts of eye-searing red during the occasional generator failure--and a tiny capable cast. (Isaac and Vikander are especially good.) Make no mistake this is a film of ideas--sadder quieter more delicate than the Hollywood sci-fi standard--where every sliding wall of opaque glass suggests something about technology and the way people would use it. Ava is specifically gendered but so is everything else in the film from the friendship and tension that develops between the two men to Calebs unconcealed attraction to this demure robot who lives in a little glass box with a closet full of floral print sundresses. In both his screenplays and his prose Garland often focuses on makeshift societies; here he creates a tiny one limited to a few rooms and hallways but with a future of infinite technological possibilities. As is often the case it cant fully let go of the world its supposed to replace.

And Is She Coming on to You? Wednesday April 8 2015 at 339 p.m. By Amy Nicholson Alicia Vikander in Ex Machina A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Ex Machina is an egghead thriller with a scary selling point Unlike Liam Neeson shooting up half of Boston this actually could be taking place right now. Its a smart film about the shrinking divide between man and robot. Its also a hoot an anti-comedy where all of the jokes double as threats and vice versa. Ex Machina is the directorial debut of sci-fi screenwriter Alex Garland who penned the better-than-it-should-be Dredd and the three-quarters-perfect Sunshine. If he didnt keep things so handsome and confident his latest could play as camp. As is its the film version of an iPhone small expensive-looking and a touch overhyped -- plus an addictive sales pitch for whatever Garland makes next.Our hero is computer coder Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) a nervous 26-year-old smartypants whos won a company contest for a weeklong trip to his bosss cabin in the woods. The place is a million-dollar bunker carved into a cliff and buried so deep in the forest that Caleb has to helicopter over a closed rank of green trees. Its all glass and stone like the centerfold pin-up of Paranoid Environmentalist Living. When Caleb enters his boss Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac) scans the slender redhead and concludes ""Youre freaked out because its all super cool."" Thats Ex Machinas tone in one line a clever and contradictory mix of truth and bluster.Film DetailsCritics Pick Ex Machina RatingR GenreDrama Running Time110 min. More Info Trailer Nathan is a billionaire genius with an ego to match. At 13 he invented the search engine Bluebook a Web goliath with a lot of vowels in common with you-know-what. (Garland would swear its just coincidence that Google co-founder Larry Page built his own 6000-square-foot ecolodge.) Isaac keys into that Internet-age mix of artificial inauthenticity -- hes fantastic and funny even though were too freaked out to laugh. Nathan wears wife-beaters works out eats kale and stocks his house with expensive artisanal booze that he chugs every night until he collapses. When he tries to sound charming hes a transparent jerk. Handing Caleb a keycard that permits entrance only into certain rooms -- a modern twist on Bluebeard -- Nathan waves away the weirdness by insisting that the system ""just makes everything easier for you"" and struts off confident that hes pulled another fast one. This master of spin makes even his baldness look like a feat of testosterone -- hes so macho that the hair on his head has simply taken up with his beard.In part Ex Machina is about todays concept of power the kind of men even James Bond and Jason Bourne are grudgingly aware actually rule the world. Those heroes might get rid of one Nathan but theres a thousand more tiny titans just like him slurping oysters and plotting their next success.

Were curious too about that painful-looking skull-level crack in her Plexiglas but first Nathan wants Caleb to chat with Ava to see if she passes the Turing test -- that is is her mind indistinguishable from a humans? Murmurs Caleb ""If youve created a conscious machine its not the history of man. Its the history of gods."" Naturally Nathan misremembers his quote as ""Youre not a man youre God.""With the exception of Nathans silent servant Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) this is a tidy three-character personality clash among people who in any other film would each be The Smart One. (Even Nathans hangovers segue to a joke about the theory of relativity.) Crammed together they jockey for respect. Nathans confident that Caleb will eventually give Ava his thumbs-up. After all to program her Nathan hacked into every cellphone on earth to study human behavior which he describes as ""failed imperfect chaotic"" -- i.e. near-impossible to design.Garland is doing the same thing. Hes analytical not emotional. The film keeps us at a remove asking us too to observe and deduce. But Caleb has a harder time staying logical. As Ava and Caleb begin to bond she covers her machinery with girlish dresses and thick almost fetishistic wool socks. Vikanders posture is so erect and her balletic walk so precise that shes convincing as a machine whos convincing as a human -- she lets us understand why Caleb almost forgets about her circuitry even as she reminds us to stay alert.Eventually shell ask Caleb a question hes afraid to answer What will Nathan do with her if Caleb decides her wiring isnt perfect? The answer is inevitable. But the route Ex Machina takes to get there is full of fun detours -- robot nudity disco dancing digressions on the importance of Jackson Pollock -- that celebrate Garlands own imperfect chaos an achievement worth applause.EX MACHINA | Written and directed by Alex Garland | A24 | ArcLight Hollywood Landmark Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Photo A24 MOVIE REVIEW Ex Machina Running time 108 minutes. Rated R (profanity nudity violence). A melange of cerebral Stanley Kubrick-style sci-fi and adolescent fantasy about sexy robot chicks ""Ex Machina"" offers plenty of intriguing style but a spotty story line. Domhnall Gleeson stars as a programmer at a Google-like company whose autocratic alcoholic founder (Oscar Isaac) invites him to a secret underground lair for a mysterious project. That turns out to be testing the artificial intelligence capabilities of an advanced lady robot (Alicia Vikander) who when the boss isnt looking warns the newcomer that sinister deeds are afoot at the high-tech complex. Arty portentous and slow to develop the first film as writer-director by ""28 Days Later"" writer Alex Garland nevertheless has a deliciously eerie suspenseful quality as the three super-intelligent leads scramble for advantage. It doesnt quite add up in the end but its heady stuff anyway dense with moments of shivery beauty and frightening ideas.

Director Alex Garland (150). R Sexuality violence. Union Square. ""Ex Machina"" shows theres still life left in tales of artificial intelligence. This exquisitely acted genuinely creepy minimalist drama does spin its wheels a bit before a cool conclusion. But the movie has a spark of creativity not seen in ""Chappie"" or ""Eva"" two of the recent robots-among-us flicks. (Coming up soon is ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" where the titular villain is A.I. in armor and ""Terminator Genisys."") In this film though set in the near future Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a nerdy programmer at a huge corporation. (Think Apple times a thousand.) He wins a lottery to spend a week at the sprawling estate of his companys mysterious owner Nathan (Oscar Isaac). The compound is in a part of the world that seems to be surrounded by melting glaciers. When Caleb arrives he has a task Converse with a robot Nathan has built to see if she has achieved independent artificial intelligence. The robot called Ava never leaves the room shes in. As she and Caleb do ""testing sessions"" disturbing things come to light about Nathans bro-buddy friendliness his isolated house and what came before and what may await melancholy Ava. ""Ex Machina"" is written and directed by novelist Alex Garland whose sterling genre work includes the screenplays for ""28 Days Later"" and ""Never Let Me Go."" He understands that even more than synthetic creations we need to connect to the humans in the film. Though crucial details are deliberately withheld we recognize Caleb and Nathan seeing ourselves in one while mesmerized by the other. This movies fluid forlorn sense of identity most recalls ""Moon"" with a dash of ""Forbidden Planet"" thrown in. Alicia Vikander in ""Ex Machina"" (A24) Oscar Isaac (l.) and Domhnall Gleeson in ""Ex Machina."" (A24) Sonoya Mizuno (left) and Alicia Vikander in ""Ex Machina."" (A24) Gleeson has a vulnerable lost-puppy quality which slides away as he becomes aware of what hes stumbled into. Isaac (""Inside Llewyn Davis"" ""A Most Violent Year"") makes Nathan cagey and creepy but with a funny-cocky cool; he seems comfortable being casually sociopathic. Both actors are in the upcoming ""Star Wars Episode VII"" and they whet our appetite here. As the synthetic girl -- Nathans hobby turned obsession -- Alicia Vikander is terrifically remote soulful and still like the film itself. We see her characters electrodes but even more evident is the pain hope and maybe deception on her flesh-mask face. The power in this intriguing film is not seeing how machine-like she is but how human shes willing to become.

"Review A visionary sci-fi thriller is born in Ex Machina | The Big Story Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Review A visionary sci-fi thriller is born in Ex Machina By LINDSEY BAHR Apr. 7 2015 701 PM EDT Cinema has always been fascinated by androids. From ""Metropolis"" to ""Blade Runner"" the juxtaposition of humans next to their artificial form has provided endless hours of stories that can be as exhilarating as they are poignant. Tough moral questions about consciousness and humanity go down easier when hidden under the glossy sheen of genre after all.With so many now-classics preceding it ""Ex Machina"" might seem like just the latest flavor in the android movie shop. And yet without necessarily expanding on this well-trod territory or innovating contemporary science-fiction by going deep on a simple construct ""Ex Machina"" establishes itself as a unique and deeply unsettling psychological thriller thats both necessary and unforgettable.The construct in question How good is this android?Writer-director Alex Garland in his feature debut tells the story with basically only three characters Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) the sharp programmer whose life is upended to spend a few days in a remote location with his companys billionaire CEO and brilliant recluse Nathan (Oscar Isaac); and Nathans creation Ava (Alicia Vikander).Caleb thinks hes won a prize and a retreat with a genius. Its only when he arrives that Nathan tells him his real purpose is to advise Nathan on whether or not Ava passes the human or machine test.Nathans home embodies the modern design ideal of organic architecture and he and Caleb discuss Ava as Schubert and Bach play faintly in the background. Big fascinating ideas fly around at rapid speed but ""should"" does not seem to be in their vocabulary.Garland builds a subtle tension by making everything slightly off from the concrete bunker-like bedrooms to the occasional power-outages and the militaristic security methods. Caleb is never at ease and as the audiences window into this strange world neither are we.A big reason for that is Nathan. Sure the dorky Caleb is supposed to be intellectually disarmed by the fact that Nathan created the worlds most powerful search engine as a teenager. But Isaac with his shaved head thick black beard and burly but fit physique is an intimidating physical presence as well. Hes a bruiser a genius and a charismatic eccentric who spends his days boxing and his nights getting blind drunk alone.Isaac who is quickly proving himself to be one of the greats of his generation plays Nathan as a celebrity of sorts -- the kind who is always requesting that the other person just be more ""real"" which usually has the opposite effect.But its really Avas film. Her form too is distracting. Her body made of caged metal and fiber optics though interesting and perfectly curved is secondary to the face -- the only visually human aspect to her.Her innocent beauty perfect expressiveness and surprising wit even make Caleb question whether Nathan is using her loveliness to muddle judgment (i.e. the magicians assistant).""Did you program her to flirt with me"" Caleb asks self-consciously at one point.As the test progresses and Ava starts to resemble not an experiment but a prisoner things get more complicated and motives all around become fuzzier. Then ""Ex Machina"" elegantly transitions away from a theatrical exercise in discourse into a tense thriller with gripping twists and haunting turns right up to the conclusion.Perverse and provocative ""Ex Machina"" is a cult classic in the making.""Ex Machina"" an A24 release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""for graphic nudity language sexual references and some violence.""

By Anthony Lane Alicia Vikander plays a robot named Ava in a movie directed by Alex Garland.   Credit Illustration by Brian Ewing There are three main characters in ""Ex Machina"" and one of them is Ava (Alicia Vikander). She is not just a pretty face. The rest of her head too is very pretty a dome of fine metallic mesh atop a delicate stalk of clear neck through which we see the glow of blue diodes and the play of mechanical muscles. The pattern continues below. Parts of her like the bust are politely encased while others like the legs and the stomach are transparent with luminous coils and loops where her guts should be. When Ava walks or turns she gives off sounds--tiny whirrs and hisses as of rods and pistons sighing into place. If necessary her frame can be robed in strips of flesh to fashion a complete young woman. In all she seems absorbingly real enough to overshadow the non-robotic people she meets. That is both the coup and the pitfall of ""Ex Machina"" the humanoid is more human than the humans. Avas creator is Nathan (Oscar Isaac) a loner of bottomless wealth. At the age of thirteen he wrote the code for Bluebook--""the worlds most popular Internet search engine."" Now he is a guru with all the fixings cropped hair a thicket of black beard a burning stare. He resides with Ava in a research facility among meadows and mountains attended by a silent servant named Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno). One day a helicopter brings Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) ""the most talented coder in my company"" according to Nathan. Beware of movies that jack themselves up with superlatives as if straining not merely to catch but to merit our earnest attention; in ""Ex Machina"" the strain increases as Caleb declares ""Im hot on high-level abstractions"" and as Nathan beguiles him in return. ""Youre good with words youre quotable"" he says. Sorry guys thats for us to decide. Calebs task is to put Ava through the hoops to determine in a series of interviews whether she can truly think and even feel for herself. If so she will represent--you guessed it--""the greatest scientific event in the history of man"" as Nathan modestly claims. There are seven conversations (titled ""Ava Session 1"" and so forth) and they are the endoskeleton to which the story clings. To begin with they have the lurch of an unsuccessful speed date. ""You like Mozart?"" Ava inquires. ""I like Depeche Mode"" Caleb replies. During the second session however theres a power cut and under blood-red emergency lighting and with Nathan unable to listen in she murmurs to Caleb ""You shouldnt trust anything he says."" The plot is in motion although who is pulling the strings--Pinocchio or Geppetto so to speak--becomes ever harder to decide. Ava has no doubt that she exists but she fears that such existence can be terminated. ""What will happen to me if I fail your test?"" she asks Caleb. ""Do you think I might be switched off?"" That faint tapping you can hear is scholars already drafting their lectures on the mind-body problem in ""Ex Machina"" adding it to the roster of films from ""Metropolis"" to last months ""Chappie"" that make philosophers go soft in the hard drive. But a movie can tackle a host of interesting themes and still be a bad movie as anyone who saw a befuddled Johnny Depp grope his way through ""Transcendence"" can attest and there are times when the gears of ""Ex Machina"" which was written and directed by Alex Garland begin to grind. The third session is particularly glum proving that the spirit of screwball has yet to descend upon robotics. ""How do I look?"" Ava says. ""You look"" Caleb begins and there follows a long hunt for the mot juste ""Good."" And yet ""Ex Machina"" despite the stutters slowly finds its grip and starts to squeeze. Garland whose scripts have often prowled the zones of science fiction (he wrote ""28 Days Later"" ""Sunshine"" and ""Never Let Me Go"") is making his debut as a director and his method feels patient to a fault. There is little excitement even at the climax but the creepiness of the setup generates its own hum of suspense and you hunger for more details of exactly what Nathan has devised. ""I had to get away from circuitry"" he tells Caleb showing him a manufactured brain--a beauteous clump of gel the size of a conch its innards writhing with synaptic sparks. Oscar Isaac is someone filmmakers turn to for a cautious intensity and here he dials it up leaving us nicely uncertain whether Nathan is a dauntless pioneer or a dangerous loon. Hanging over him--and also over Kyoko and Caleb who at one point slices his own arm as if to cry ""Do I not bleed?""--is a suspicion inherited from ""Blade Runner"" that anyone can be a replicant perhaps unwittingly so. Hence the great sequence in which Nathan and Kyoko start to boogie their rhythms so seamlessly attuned that you wonder if dance can be downloaded like an app. If perfection is inhuman though what should we make of Fred Astaire? In the end ""Ex Machina"" lives and dies by Alicia Vikander. The film clicks on when she first appears and it dims every time she goes away. She will be much in evidence this year with six movies set for release but Ava may be hard to beat. Her initial ""Hello"" to Caleb with half a question mark hovering after it echoes the ""Hello"" with which another Ava marked her ominous entrance. Viewers of ""The Killers"" in 1946 saw Ava Gardner swivel on a piano stool greet Burt Lancaster size up the poor lunk and let him know with a single smile to his infinite delight that he was doomed. You would think that the new Ava being man-made would be less of a femme fatale but she can still unmake a man with her imitation of a femme--putting on clothes shoes stockings and a wig then removing them in semi-silhouette when she is sure that Caleb is watching. That is pure calculation of course easily arranged by a programmer as dexterous as Nathan yet Vikander brimful of an eagerness not so much to engage with the world as to toy with it does suggest that Ava has slipped the bonds of her inventor. Such is the dream of movies like ""Ex Machina"" ""I Robot"" and ""A.I."" an intelligence that sloughs off its own artifice. The components of Spielbergs movie didnt quite slot together but the leading androids--Haley Joel Osment as the kid and Jude Law as the smooth-skinned gigolo--were touching in their aspirations and Vikander somehow twines them both the innocent and the decadent into the figure of Ava. We are reminded (and this is why such films strong and weak alike keep coming along) that the goal of robots is not merely to serve us without causing harm as Isaac Asimov proposed but to play a part. They are Method humans reaching deep into their software to beget a replica of truth. Ava doesnt just need to get out of Nathans house and fast. She needs an agent. Happiness in the first half hour of ""About Elly"" is passed around like the flu. A bunch of college friends get together for a weekend away most of them with spouses and small children. The friends are no longer young yet their spirits seem buoyantly high and the movie is keen to join in--glancing at face after face and eavesdropping on the overlapping chat. Characters dance without warning answer a question with a line of song and play charades. They have to shift from one rental villa to another but the move doesnt faze them even though the new place has broken windows and no beds. Besides its right on the beach. You can hear the crash of the surf. At what point we realize that disaster awaits and that these contented lives like all lives can be caught in a riptide is hard to specify. Suffice to say that something happens and that husbands wives and old pals who felt inseparable descend into a roiling recrimination. Its difficult and upsetting to behold but we shouldnt be surprised; the director is Asghar Farhadi who mapped out the pangs of divorce in ""A Separation"" (2011). ""About Elly"" was made two years before that but only now is it being released and perhaps because the action is confined to Farhadis native Iran its a better movie than ""The Past"" (2013) which was set more tentatively in Paris. Here by the treacherous sea Farhadi is at home and as is his custom it is women who emerge from the crowd of characters and come heavy-laden to the fore. One of them is Elly (Taraneh Alidoosti) the only single woman in the group described as ""warm and calm."" She is also inscrutable and when she recedes from the action whereabouts unknown the mystery darkens. She was invited by Sepideh (Golshifteh Farahani) who despite barely knowing her was hoping to marry her off to one of the guys. As the plot proceeds we get an unnerving sense that the whole film whose early stages bore such a modern and liberated ease is gradually re-rooting itself in old tenacious beliefs--in a world where honor and shame run deeper than the mere matter of whether a person is alive or dead. ""About Elly"" both clutches us tight and shuts us out adding wave upon wave of secrets and lies. Charades were just the beginning.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Technology has not yet reached the point where a robot has passed the Turing test--fooling people into believing theyre talking to a human. But screenwriter and novelist Alex Garlands debut feature takes us to the very moment of that technological birth. What might it look like when we get there? Pretty damn slinky as it happens. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is an ace computer programmer who wins a competition to visit the remote home of his Silicon Valley companys charismatic billionaire founder (Oscar Isaac). Calebs task is to test his bosss new invention Ava a robot whose glowing LEDs and whirring servos combine with a lithe feminine form and the angelic features of actor Alicia Vikander. Caleb isnt just convinced hes smitten but the more he learns about the relationship between Ava and her volatile hard-drinking creator the more concerned he becomes for her future. There are elements of romance and dystopian thriller here though Garlands art-house pacing keeps us waiting for these threads to emerge lining up thoughtful dialogue exchanges between man and machine. Vikanders spellbinding not-quite-human presence (her synthetic skin is silky yet creepy) keeps us watching. But an obvious twist and some clunky developments--how about those sudden power cuts?--drain much of the credibility from a story that promised so much. A bit more intelligence wouldnt have gone amiss.

The potential existential threat to humans posed by the dawning era of artificial intelligence is the theme chosen by British screenwriter Alex Garland for his stylish directing debut. The subject may be familiar but Garland has a track record of rebooting and revitalizing pulp genres most notably his ""fast zombie"" script for Danny Boyles dystopian thriller 28 Days Later. He also worked with Boyle on the screen version of his own cult novel The Beach and the futuristic space adventure Sunshine. Despite its modest budget -- reportedly around 13 million -- Ex Machina looks sleek shiny and remarkably slick for a directing debut. But it also suffers from the same kind of third-act slump that marred some of Garlands previous work promising a psychological depth and dramatic punch that it never quite delivers. That said this is still a classy piece of cerebral sci-fi with high production values and hot media buzz that should propel it beyond fanboy circles. It opens in Britain next week with a U.S. launch planned for SXSW in March followed by an April release through niche distributor A24. Already on course for sci-fi immortality in the next Star Wars movie rising young Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson stars as Caleb a geeky 24-year-old coder for a Google-like Internet company who wins an office lottery prize to spend a week with his reclusive genius boss Nathan (Oscar Isaac) at his remote fortress of solitude in the Alaska mountains. Essentially Caleb is Charlie to Nathans Willy Wonka. But soon after he arrives by helicopter it becomes clear Calebs golden ticket was planted by Nathan who needs a human lab rat to assist in his top-secret research project to build the worlds first free-thinking android Ava (Alicia Vikander). Initially informal and laid back Nathans forced bromance with his new house guest soon takes an ominous turn when he presses Caleb into subjecting Ava to the ""Turing Test"" (as seen in Blade Runner) which is designed to differentiate humans from smart machines. But Ava has other plans running her own sly tests on Caleb as she flirtatiously recruits him for a robot mutiny against Nathan. This three-way battle of wits eventually becomes a lethal fight for survival. Caleb is forced to choose between the seductive Ava and the bullying Nathan both of whom appear to have murky motives. Gleeson is excellent at conveying brainy beta-male vulnerability and handles his American accent convincingly but he still feels a little too wan for leading man duties. Heavily bearded and barely recognizable from previous roles Isaac is more impressive. His Method-style immersion in Nathan combines the Zen intensity of Steve Jobs with the party-hard muscularity of a surfer dude. The delightfully unexpected scene where he breaks into synchronized disco dancing with his mysterious Japanese partner Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) is one of the best in the movie a welcome shot of humor in an otherwise self-serious project. But Vikander is the heart of the film her poised performance combining mechanical implacability with troubling emotional undertones. The Swedish-born ex-ballerina moves with a dancers precision incorporating subtle hints of cybernetic stiffness as she extends her lean biomechanical limbs to the soft whirr of internal servo motors. Conceived by a team led by production designer Mark Digby and costume designer Sammy Sheldon Differ Avas graceful humanoid form is the films chief visual trump card scoring maximum eye-popping impact with a transparent wire-mesh jewel-case midriff and luminous cranium that were added in postproduction. She looks like a walking talking next-generation Apple product the first iHuman maybe? Artfully spartan in its use of digital effects Ex Machina looks great forging a strong visual aesthetic from a limited budget. All glass walls and stripped pine Nathans remote mountain retreat is elegantly sketched out as a modernist minimalist holiday cabin perched atop a high-security subterranean bunker. Interiors are clinical and sparse with muted colors and discreetly embedded technology. With Norway standing in for Alaska the landscape framing the action is elemental and vast awesome in scale but chillingly devoid of human life. It could be prehistoric or even postapocalyptic. Grounded in real cutting-edge science Garlands talk-heavy screenplay has the crisp feel of a three-handed stage play. Imagining the imminent future of sentient machines that many computer experts now deem to be inevitable he speculates how the birth of a ""singularity"" like Ava might spell doom for clunky old analog software like Homo sapiens. Garland also pointedly sets aside the famous Three Laws of Robotics drafted by pioneering sci-fi author Isaac Asimov which forbade machines from harming humans. The technology in Ex Machina may be current but the story belongs to a long screen lineage spanning from Metropolis to The Terminator to The Matrix and dozens more besides. Garland brings little fresh to this familiar man vs. machine theme aside from explicitly sympathizing with the robots over the humans. He also signals far too soon that Nathan is a mad scientist in classic movie tradition Doctor Frankenstein with a hint of Colonel Kurtz but never provides any plausible explanation for how he ended up so damaged. Garlands screenplay is linear and low on tension with too few of the dramatic swerves and shock twists that many sci-fi fans will be expecting. There are promising hints of a Stepford Wives feminist subtext in the male human/female robot power play especially when Avas potential as an expensive sex toy is briefly discussed as well as a teasing Blade Runner-style sequence about robots who believe themselves to be humans. Sadly both these intriguing tangents lead nowhere. The story ends in a muddled rush leaving many unanswered questions. Like a newly launched high-end smartphone Ex Machina looks cool and sleek but ultimately proves flimsy and underpowered. Still for dystopian future-shock fans who can look beyond its basic design flaws Garlands feature debut functions just fine as superior pulp sci-fi.

While multiplex fantasy remains an extravagantly caped boys club a stealthy gender inquiry is taking place in more specialized sci-fi territory with Alex Garlands brittle beautiful ""Ex Machina"" its latest slyly thoughtful line of questioning. A worthy companion piece to ""Under the Skin"" and ""Her"" in its examination of what constitutes human and feminine identity -- and whether those two concepts need always overlap -- Garlands long-anticipated directorial debut synthesizes a dizzy range of the writers philosophical preoccupations into a sleek spare chamber piece Mary Shelleys ""Frankenstein"" redreamed as a 21st-century battle of the sexes. Exquisitely designed and electrically performed by Alicia Vikander Domhnall Gleeson and particularly Oscar Isaac this uncomplicated but subtly challenging film requires strong word of mouth from its January U.K. release (and its March SXSW premiere) if audiences abroad are to tap its porcelain surface. ""Im hot on high-level abstraction"" brags 24-year-old Internet coder Caleb (Gleeson) early on in the proceedings -- a qualification as necessary for the position of protagonist in an Alex Garland narrative as it is for the mysterious mission hes assigned in the films opaque opening reel. Much of Garlands fiction and screenwriting work is built on austerely abstract hypotheses yet peopled by comparatively fragile characters unequal to the challenges of their story world. In its dramatization of a literal love affair between human and artificial intelligence -- the same unsolvable conundrum that haunted the recent ""Her"" -- ""Ex Machina"" follows suit its updated mad-scientist study showing mans capacity for invention exceeding his reserves of empathy. (In this case at least the gender-biased pronoun feels appropriate.) One might call it a cautionary tale though Garland isnt necessarily on humanitys side. Indeed the films very first frame serves to distance viewers from their own D.p. Rob Hardys camera peers at Caleb in his office as if from the reverse side of his computer screen while muted audio suggests were observing him from a quarantined realm. As it turns out hes soon to join us there. It emerges that Caleb has won a competition staged by his employers the worlds largest Internet provider to spend a week with enigmatic CEO Nathan (Isaac) at the latters expensively hermetic woodland lair -- dazzlingly envisioned by production designer Mark Digby as a palatial blend of Philip Johnson severity and Scandinavian laboratory chic. Upon arrival however the wet-behind-the-ears nerd discovers that his golden ticket is no luxury perk Rather hes been recruited to participate in a cloistered research experiment testing the limits and limitations of Nathans stunningly advanced new developments in AI technology. The boss most recent breakthrough takes the form of Ava (Vikander) a female-gendered robot whose expressive peach-soft facial features belie her transparent synthetic form and complex exposed wiring. And so during the first of Calebs seven planned consultation sessions with her do her casual conversational ability and dry even flirtatious sense of humor; somewhat surprisingly Nathan has designed an organism as delicate and genial as he is brusque and self-absorbed. Calebs task is to perform a Turing test on Ava determining whether her thinking and behavior is at any level distinguishable from that of a human being -- and if so where the disconnect lies. (That of course makes ""Ex Machina"" the second film of recent months following the much-garlanded ""The Imitation Game"" to concern itself with the research of computer scientist Alan Turing. Furthermore it arguably does a better job of honoring his intellectual legacy.) As the interloper falls hard and fast for the android the test would appear to be passed with flying colors. But is she the only case study? And has her precise degree of consciousness and calculative ability been programmed by her creator or has his expertise in this department exceeded his control? As the balance of power wavers between human and humanoid intelligence a second dividing factor appears in this uneasy quasi-incestuous love triangle as Ava exhibits hints of a feminine intuition that the jockish Nathan seems unlikely to have formatted himself -- even if in a provocative detail that opens up further consideration of sexual hierarchy he made sure to grant her functioning facsimiles of genitalia. ""Ex Machina"" turns out to be far wittier and more sensual than its coolly unblemished exterior implies; its a trick that mirrors Avas own apparent Turing-test-defying evolution. As further intricate psychological possibilities unfurl the pic extends questions of mortality and human construction raised by Garland in his deft 2010 adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguros genetic sci-fi parable ""Never Let Me Go"" -- principally that of what humanity is worth if it can be so soulfully replicated. Isaac has been in such a rare run of form recently that one fears for his ability to surprise but its still intact here. Cutting a more baleful figure than usual with his dense beard and scalp-skimming buzz cut his Nathan responds to the world around him -- the limited world hes curated for himself at least -- with unfazed-sounding comebacks and laid-back swagger that ultimately betray the strenuous effort behind them. Its the piercingly funny sendup that the ""tech-bro"" elite has had coming for too long but Isaac is too nuanced a performer to leave it there never neglecting the petulant brilliance that finally makes this designer Dr. Frankenstein a tragic figure. Garlands script doesnt grant Gleeson and Vikander quite the same liberty to play but both actors turn in remarkably disciplined work articulating a burgeoning romance in which the boundary between real and simulated feeling is kept teasingly ambiguous throughout. Swedish export Vikander whose shimmering physical presence increasingly recalls that of her compatriot Ingrid Bergman aces a particularly tough assignment in Ava a cipher whose every gesture and vocal inflection renders her at once more human and less explicably alien. Filmed on an approximate budget of just 15 million the film looks and sounds immaculate at every turn with its contained interior-based three-hander structure permitting the money to be lavished less on locations and more on eerily vivid digital and prosthetic effects. (The films sporadic attempts to ""open out"" proceedings as when a dialogue-driven scenes is situated by a waterfall rather than one of Nathans airtight suites are more a distraction than an asset.) The effects and makeup teams have made Ava a robot of strikingly brutal grace her flesh bluntly disrupted by metallic components. Fresh off his elegant work on period dramas ""The Invisible Woman"" and ""Testament of Youth"" Hardy brings equivalent visual propriety and composure to a more futuristic mood piece while composers Ben Salisbury and Portishead frontman Geoff Barrow contribute a bristling electronic score that swarms and simmers with the characters own emotional surges. Given Barrows presence one half expects the film to close with his bands signature hit ""Glory Box"" the key refrain of which -- ""Give me a reason to be a woman"" -- would aptly sum up its hybrid heroines own state of mind.
