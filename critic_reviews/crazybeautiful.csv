This well-cast and acted romance between a royally screwed up Westside L.A. rich girl and a purposeful Mexican-American boy from the barrio scores some easy points for its clever opposition of social milieus and of the attitudes to be found therein. But the significant potential of its premise is squandered by an increasing reliance on teen movie cliches. A wrong-side-of-the-tracks romance gathers some steam before fatally derailing in ""Crazy/Beautiful."" This well-cast and acted romance between a royally screwed up Westside L.A. rich girl and a purposeful Mexican-American boy from the barrio scores some easy points for its clever opposition of social milieus and of the attitudes to be found therein. But the significant potential of its premise is squandered by an increasing reliance on teen movie cliches silly plotting and the urge to be upbeat rather than to communicate life lessons. The rarity of serious high school romances in the marketplace of the moment coupled with the appeal of leads Kirsten Dunst and especially newcomer Jay Hernandez looks to prompt a good turnout from the young target audience. Still this is one of those cases where faced with certain narrative choices the filmmakers have consistently compromised their work in what feel like marketing-dictated directions which steadily undercuts its scattered authentic elements and consequently weakens its genuine connection with the viewer. Its hard to believe that a more honest telling of this story one that dealt more openly and directly with what kids think and feel and therefore spoke to its audience more meaningfully wouldnt perform even better than this cosmeticized version. As it is pic consists of a series of touchstone relationship scenes papered together by a relentless stream of 30 insistently banal and thematically on-the-nose pop tunes. A bad girl who lives in a glass house overlooking the sea Nicole (Dunst) wears cut-off T-shirts with no bra to Pacific High in affluent Pacific Palisades and cuts class to drink. Looking not quite as trashy as her best friend Maddy (Taryn Manning) she still cuts the figure of a dissolute tramp the definition of a spoiled rich kid spiraling in the wrong direction. Nicole surprises even herself when she sets her sights on Carlos (Hernandez) a fine-looking straight-A student and football star who gets up before dawn every day to bus all the way to Pacific from East L.A. Still obedient to his strict old country mother Carlos is earnest cognizant of the value of hard work and a good education and lives by the sort of strong values that Nicole scoffs at. Still its impossible for Carlos to ignore the ripe charms that Nicole practically pushes in his face on top of the lure of the different and the unknown so the young man allows himself to be driven around and flirted with by Nicole and Maddy. Before long Nicole takes him home and in broad daylight and with her father right outside her bedroom window starts stripping herself and Carlos in the expectation of immediate gratification. With a sense of modesty and decorum Carlos wont play along with such a scenario so the inevitable is merely delayed a bit while Nicole tarnishes the good boy by inducing him to slack off on some of his family and school responsibilities. While familiar the dynamic thus far is plausible enough and both young thesps invest their characters with absolute credibility and solid detailing; although its not explained why Nicole really is floundering and Carlos while human enough not to be able resist the fruit dangling in front of him still seems sufficiently strong to be seduced only up to a point. But whats a big drag for Nicole turns out to represent a big break for Carlos Her father Tom (Bruce Davison) is a longtime congressman who offers to help Carlos in his ambition to get into Annapolis. Relations between Nicole and Dad are severely strained and worse between Nicole and stepmom Courtney (Lucinda Jenney) whos preoccupied with her baby daughter and cant stand Nicoles desultory attitude. When Nicole is with Carlos who dreams of being a Navy pilot an occasional sweetness emerges from the damaged girl notably when she has the generosity to hire a small plane to take Carlos up in the air for the first time resulting in one of the films better scenes. But theres no question that shes damaged goods and on balance not at all a good influence on her otherwise highly focused boyfriend. In a teen romance in which youre meant to root unconditionally for the young lovers to make it work youre not supposed to agree with the negative assessments and admonishments of old fogey parents. However when Tom eventually warns Carlos that Nicole is highly destructive and that he should stay away from her for his own good its all too obvious that hes right. Unfortunately debuting scripters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi turn Carlos suddenly dumb at this point letting him do things that are totally out of character for the principled young man weve come to know. Pic abruptly veers into reckless-young-lovers-on-the-run territory at the precise moment one doesnt even want the relationship to be happening anymore and certain revelations about why Nicole is as messed up as she is come far too late in the game to make the difference they should in Carlos -- and the viewers -- understanding of and sympathy for her. Upbeat coda feels phony and tacked-on. Despite all the missteps the effective cross-cultural dynamic and the allure of the two leads make the film somewhat palatable for a while. Following up on her surprise hit ""Bring It On"" last year Dunst starts her transition from teen cutie to serious young adult actress here with a perf that suggests that she would have been happy to go even further into the troubled psyche of a girl seemingly bent upon squandering all her advantages in life. In his bigscreen debut Hernandez is a major find for whom big things unquestionably lie ahead. Presenting a sincerity and clean-cut image that never seems square the actor is enormously appealing has an openness that the camera likes and can shift emotional gears with no evident problem. Only downside to his character is that the script provides no indication of the pressures hes had to deal with at home and in his community to get where he is; his homies could have provided some sense of this but are instead presented as a bunch of benign lugs who have little evident attitude toward the certainty that their buddy will shortly be leaving them behind. Other perfs border on the caricatured. Davison achieves some nice humor of recognition as a do-gooder liberal politico who drives an electric car and casually drops names of such pals as Martin Sheen and the late Cesar Chavez. Jenney captures the neuroses of the modern over-concerned mom with almost embarrassing accuracy while Manning shares with Dunst in some real teen spirit scenes of wild abandon in the early-going. Behind-the-scenes hands do their jobs efficiently but the music staffers overdo theirs with a predominantly song-oriented soundtrack that is incredibly overbearing and obvious in its point-making. Title is being printed entirely lowercase in print ads and much editorial copy but normal uppercase for the first letter of each word prevails onscreen.

Hes not amused it takes two hours on the bus from his home in East LA to the Pacific Palisades school they both attend. Nevertheless the relationship blossoms into a reckless exquisitely teenage romance. Nicoles stepmom and Congressman father dont care what she does. But Carlos family are furious. Whats he doing throwing away hard-won opportunities - and over a white girl? When even Mr Oakley (Davison) advises caution on the ground that Nicole will drag him off the rails after her Carlos wonders if his dream of becoming a USAF pilot isnt more important. Affectingly directed this takes every cliche in the teen-rom-dram book - and squeezes some life out of them. All credit to the leads especially Dunst whose raw egoless performance betokens great things. The ending of course is a cornball cop-out but otherwise for a Hollywood genre movie this feels wonderfully real.

Hollywood Walt Disney Productions; Release Date Wide 06/29/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Buena Vista Pictures Posted June 28 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT Kirsten Dunst wears no discernible makeup in crazy/beautiful and her hair cut to medium length hangs over her face in limp indifferent bangs. Her smile which reveals a row of faintly vampiric teeth flashes with pleasurable hunger but its a momentary sensation held in check by eyes that sparkle and then turn dark. This is no primped and airbrushed teen idol. Its an actress in the raw her feelings shining right through her pale dimpled skin. In ""crazy/beautiful"" Dunst plays 17 year old Nicole an overprivileged Los Angeles high school student who drinks and drugs too much and fashions herself a wild child in her baby doll insignia halter tops but who is really a sweet tempered lost girl acting out her confusion because its the only thing that shes certain of. When she meets Carlos (Jay Hernandez) a smoldering Latino classmate who travels two hours by bus each way from East L.A. to attend the ritzy mostly white Pacific High School she draws him into her maelstrom the recklessness of her desire. ""crazy/beautiful"" is a romance that never completely shakes off ""opposite sides of the tracks"" cliches even when its clever about reversing them. Carlos has been made into a liberal hunk role model for the Ricky Martin era - a soft-spoken A student and football star who wont even drink at a party and is so assuredly chivalrous that he forces Nicole to take her time getting him into bed. Aimed like catnip at the new melting pot teen audience Carlos the baby cheeked swarthy saint is a demographers wet dream but newcomer Jay Hernandez with his intelligent open face and killer grin gives him glimmers of depth and sorrow. Carlos doesnt just fall in love with Nicole. Hes got to save her as well - save her from herself - and Dunst and Hernandez who look terrific together draw an intimacy right out of their hot bod flirtation. Whats Nicoles problem anyway? Her father a widowed California congressman (Bruce Davison) loves her too much and not enough insensitively conflating the reckless troubled girl with her self destructive mom. Or something like that. Davison a great actor appears to be playing Michael Douglas before he eases up on the grouchy anger and softens the character into a creation of his own. The familial strife comes right out of the dysfunction handbook - at least until Davison and Dunst are finally allowed to play off each other at which point ""crazy/beautiful"" becomes genuinely touching. Dunst in her finest performance yet has now transcended her fellow teen stars. She is arguably the first actress of her generation poised to take on Gwyneth and Julia.

Starring Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez. Directed by John Stockwell. (PG-13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The beautiful half of the new teen-smooch drama ""crazy/beautiful"" should have known by the way the crazier half parked her car sideways that it wouldnt last. But having none of the Prince perception and all of his carnal wonder Carlos (Jay Hernandez) ditches his boys anyway after a football game to slink toward the girl whos been waiting for like ever for him to wander out of the locker room. The little red Corvette is Kirsten Dunst -- fast curvy kinda dangerous fun as hell -- and over the course of their torrid and sweet love thang her Nicole will run her body right to the ground. But hell be there to prop it up and possibly see it through rehab. Yes rehab. ""crazy/beautiful"" has a lowercase title as a counterpoint to its capital-I issues. The movie fluctuates between movie-of-the-week nonsense and some velvety treasure stolen from a 1978 time capsule. Even when the movie is bad -- which it is in its abrupt mismanaged final-act attempt to cram in moments of forgiveness and clarity -- its addictively so. Up-to-the-minute and melodramatic beyond its years ""crazy/beautiful"" is a Susan Hayward movie with a Britney Spears wardrobe. And not in a way that exploits a short attention span There are moments when director John Stockwells pacing is trying to enter the Terrence Malick Teen-Movie Sweepstakes. All you can hear during Carlos and Nicoles first two kisses is the saliva being exchanged -- the songlessness is astounding; the heat should make good sex-ed for anybody polishing that next Freddie Prinze Jr. exercise in hand- holding. (Though look out for the lovey-dovey montage set to David Gray.) Im still not convinced that what Nicole and Carlos are in is love per se -- its more like a Noxzema ad with heavy emotional anchors. But some of the dialogue in Phil Hay and Matt Manfredis script is post-adolescent stuff where you can actually hear the two hearts beating as one special-victims unit -- so as to ask ""Nicole how do we fix you girl?"" Theirs is a wrong-side-of-the-tracks situation where things look worse at the rich girls house. Aside from the fact that Carlos rises at the crack of dawn and takes the livelong day to get to Pacific Palisades for school his life is sweet by comparison. He meets her while shes community-servicing the trash on the beach. With an eye on erotic legend she tells him and his homies that she got caught robbing a 7-Eleven Yeah shes the Bonnie Parker of the Cosmo Girl petty- theft ring. Nicole was actually picked up for DUI. Nicoles a boozer a stoner and all-around party jockey -- rich and love- starved. Mommy killed herself; daddy (Bruce Davison) is a U.S. congressman too freaked out and careerist to decelerate his Tasmanian devil child. Because the film has a Disney-ordered mandate to appeal to Americas underaged what exactly Nicole is hopped up on is still on the editors hard drive. So in the spirit of the movies PG-13 rating Disney would like you to think shes high on life. Until the DVD well never see her do the hard stuff. But thanks to Dunst and some nice patchwork we know. Dunsts face is itself some kind of 12-step program. She looks as if shes been launched from a confetti gun her hair wet with bong water and skin chilled to a whiter shade of bathtub pale. Hernandez whos been plucked from the set of the MTV soap ""Undressed"" plays her enabler-boyfriend-voice of reason under a Kirsten Dunst spell. Carlos stays out all hours of the night; hes late and underdressed for his sisters birthday party; he sasses his struggling mother (Soledad St. Hilaire) who sees this Nicole as a catastrophic derailment of her sons aviator dreams. Thats a sentiment that runs filmwide. But lo Nicoles daddy has ties at Annapolis so how bad can the white girl be? Still this is the rare interracial love flick where the white half is marginalized. Regardless theyre two kids on an island surrounded by a sea of supporting stereotypes. Dunst and Hernandez beat the odds even when the movie has the audience stressed as it does toward the end that Carlos is throwing his life away. Still the plaintive and exuberant contact high is for real. Nobody makes spectacularly cheesy love adventures like this anymore. Advisory This film contains violence sex and drug use.

(Touchstone Pictures) Wooo-hooo This is apparently the mating call of the hard-partying Pacific Palisades girl and the most frequently uttered noise in ""crazy/beautiful"" Touchstone Pictures surprisingly mawkish teen film about what happens when a straight-arrow boy from working-class East L.A. falls for a delinquent classmate from the ritzy suburb. Presumably hes attracted by her continuous drunken whoop - that or her midriff which is on view for most of the film. (Though the film credits a ""street style expert"" movie-goers may well wonder what street.) The so-earnest-it-hurts production directed by John Stockwell from a script by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi chronicles the wildly implausible high school romance of Nicole Oakley (Kirsten Dunst) and Carlos Nunez (Jay Hernandez). It turns out opposites attract Nicole the privileged daughter of a congressman is a deadbeat stoner slut Carlos a straight-A striver and star athlete who dreams of attending the Naval Academy. Conflict ensues but surprises do not; theres never any reason to doubt that its resolution is any more than a tearful heart-to-heart talk away.Nicole and Carlos meet while shes doing court-ordered maintenance at a public beach to atone for a DUI. (Hasnt he ever heard of a red flag?) He gets up every morning while its still dark to make the bus to school she sleeps off her hangovers in an all-glass hilltop house where the only Latina around is the maid. The attraction is unfathomable; the night they finally get together shes slurring her words before he even gets into her car. And he doesnt seem like the kind of guy who would enjoy a party so over the top it features indoor slam-dancing. But its nothing love - make that a love montage - cant overcome.In the films press kit the filmmakers repeatedly congratulate themselves for flouting long-obsolete stereotypes Although hes from the wrong side of the tracks shes the one whos bad news. Now theres an idea Yet the film feels less like a serious drama than a desperate bid for the reinstitution of the halter top.And while making a (relatively) serious teen film is a worthy enough goal this movie is unlikely to sell anyone on the idea. Last years Kirsten Dunst star vehicle ""Bring It On"" had a similar message about cross-cultural understanding but it was entertaining too. ""Crazy/beautiful"" could have used a cheer or two. Not to mention the kind of idiocy that gives teen films their appeal in the first place. Wheres the apple pie when you need it?Another conspicuously absent teen film convention is the makeover scene. Indeed the films greatest suspense is provided not by Nicoles increasing loss of control and estrangement from her father but the question of whether the character will finally wash her hair or put on a bra. (Answer No and no. Its street style after all.)The movie is true to the genre however in one pervasive way its use of music. Make that overuse. There are 30 songs on the soundtrack to this 95-minute movie. You do the math. The music which includes everyone from Collective Soul to Seven Mary Three Cypress Hill to the Dandy Warhols is at the forefront so often that the dialogue often seems little more than a way to mark time between music sequences.

A finger-wagging father warns his daughters suitor to stay away. This time though its not her welfare thats in jeopardy but his. Crazy/beautiful is an atypical teen drama about opposites attracting that often (and happily) confounds expectations. The trouble with most adolescent romances is that they are so well adolescent. Consider the charismatic pairing in the similar Save the Last Dance which was tripped up by MTV-addled instincts and barely reached beyond the tritely predictable. Read more Video crazy/beautiful trailer Director John Stockwell and his writers aim high despite being constricted. There has been a sanitizing of some of the serious concerns addressed in this thoughtful cautionary tale about a Latino go-getter (Jay Hernandez) from the poor side of Los Angeles who falls for a rich girl with a reckless streak (Kirsten Dunst). The better to maintain a box-office-boosting PG-13 rating in the midst of post-Columbine paranoia but a blow to seamless editing. The alcohol and drug use the cussing and the sex all have been toned down and such behavior is more talk than action. It is weird to think that Dirty Dancing or Saturday Night Fever displayed more guts about touchy topics glossy musical numbers and all. But while its punch may no longer be spiked crazy/beautiful retains much of its impact thanks to a strong cast. When it comes to being intoxicating Dunst is positively 100 proof as a wasted waif even without the benefit of a bottle or a joint. Last summers peppy Bring It On cheerleader bravely lets herself go -- sloppy and braless in revealing T-shirts her hair a greasy tangle her dazed eyes still capable of dazzle. Its believable that a dreamy straight-arrow like Hernandez who travels two hours each day just to attend a better school would get hooked on this dimpled beauty despite her irresponsibility. Of course ethnic divisiveness is played up but in a subtle way. Hernandezs pals at first admire his good luck but then resent how this white girl has come between them. His sacrificing single mother worries about his sudden carefree attitude. And Dunsts dad (Bruce Davison) a liberal congressman self-consciously explains to Hernandez that ""la vida loca"" is not just a Ricky Martin hit but a sirens call to a downward spiral. Even if most traces of nudity have been erased the two stars express the feverish intensity of their passion as well as the infectious joy of young love. The barriers between them broaden. However with a high-ranking politician on hand lifes wrinkles can be easily smoothed. Its unfortunate that Dunsts stepmother is given the stereotypical personality of a resentful prickly pear. But when father and daughter finally confront the hard facts the actors shine. Hernandez in a gentle Robby Benson way oozes matinee-idol machismo. Keep an eye on him. The true stunner here though is Dunst. She has been held back in high school roles for a while but she graduates to the next level of performing even if crazy/beautiful isnt as brave a depiction as it could have been. Her film may be compromised but she never is.

"Crazy/Beautiful | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; crazy-beautiful ) Crazy/Beautiful (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Maybe its just wishful thinking but I believe Hollywood has a tendency to underestimate the teenage viewing crowd. While its certainly true that a portion of that demographic goes to theaters only for the most superficial form of entertainment there surely must be a thirst amongst high schoolers for movies of a more challenging and less formulaic nature. It is to them that the subject matter of Crazy/Beautiful applies; unfortunately the narrative fails to live up to its potential. A hybrid of Mad Love and Save the Last Dance Crazy/Beautiful boasts strong performances underutilized by a banal storyline that manipulates familiar characters into following a well-trodden predictable path from point A to point B. Constrained by the need to conform to a safe expected narrative structure Crazy/Beautiful never does anything surprising edgy or remarkable (except perhaps allowing Kirsten Dunst to appear in unflattering makeup with a lank haircut). The characters are familiar types the wild girl on the edge; the hard-working studious boy who is attracted to her like a moth to a flame; the caring father who doesnt understand his daughter; the free-spirited best-friend; and worst of all the wicked step-mother. Solid acting gives some of these individuals greater weight and depth than they might normally have but there are limits beyond which the actors cannot push their on-screen personas. Nicole (Dunst) is the 17-year old problem daughter of Congressman Tom Oakley (Bruce Davison). She is undisciplined sullen around the house and given to alcoholic binges. One day at the beach (where shes doing community service as a result of a DUI conviction) she meets Carlos (Jay Hernandez) whos hanging out with his buddies. Theres an immediate connection between them despite their vastly different backgrounds and divergent personalities. Carlos is from the ""wrong side of the tracks"" but is working hard to craft an impressive high school resume so he can enter the Naval Academy and become a pilot. Of course he and Nicole begin to see a lot of each other which causes friction. Carlos family does not like the idea of him dating a white girl and Nicoles father is concerned that his daughters instability might ruin Carlos bright future. In the way things progress Crazy/Beautiful is a lot like both Save the Last Dance (which featured an interracial teenage romance with all of its associated complications) and Mad Love (in which a strait-laced boy fell for an unstable girl and risked everything to be with her). As was the case with those movies this one studiously avoids pushing the envelope giving it the dramatic heft of a made-for-TV movie. The argument in favor of this approach is that kids dont want to see something hard-hitting but Im not sure thats an accurate assumption. For example every teenager I have spoken to who has seen Requiem for a Dream has been astounded by it and that movie certainly doesnt adhere to cinematic conventions. Would a grittier more psychologically complex Crazy/Beautiful fare worse at the box office than the carefully sanitized version delivered by director John Stockwell? Stockwells epileptic directorial style involves a lot of camera movement and quick edits. Like too many filmmakers weaned on MTV he doesnt seem to understand the value of a ""quiet moment"". There are times when the movies busyness works against the mood its trying to create; its difficult to craft a compelling love story when music and visual flourishes keep getting in the way. Plus he has had to edit around Kirsten Dunsts nudity in order to deliver a product that conforms to PG-13 guidelines (Dunst displays just about everything she can possibly show with this classification). Freed from the lightweight constraints of the likes of Bring It On Dunst exhibits impressive dramatic depth (echoing her work in The Virgin Suicides). She brings Nicole to three-dimensional life and shows courage in her willingness to accept the de-glamorizing necessary for the role (most young actresses are not confident enough to show their ugly duckling side). Jay Hernandez whose previous body of work has primarily been on television presents a strong credible male lead. Most importantly there is tangible chemistry between Dunst and Hernandez. Character actor Bruce Davison offers an effective portrayal of a conflicted father who loves his daughter but doesnt know how to help her or to prevent her from hurting herself or others. Unfortunately Lucinda Jenney cant free herself from the orbit of the traditional unsympathetic stepmother. Crazy/Beautiful is being released as a form of summer ""counter-programming"" and may easily become lost in the shadow of the many bigger showier releases. Only sporadically involving the movie is not strong enough to warrant special attention and the pervasive sense of ""been there done that"" is unlikely to help. In the end Crazy/Beautiful might have made a more impressive splash not to mention a better movie if it had been willing to escape from the Hollywood strictures of what defines a ""teen picture"".
