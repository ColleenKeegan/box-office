"Moonrise Kingdom (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Moonrise Kingdom (PG-13) The seventh film by writer-director Wes Anderson (""Rushmore"" ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"") is his best and most satisfying work to date. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/21/2012 Editor rating 4 In Moonrise Kingdom Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) run away from home. They live on an island so they cant get far. But still they run because they are in love and they are 12 years old but their parents say they are too young and there is just no way. Fortunately Sam is a decorated Khaki Scout with many badges in camping and foraging. He makes great comfortable tents for Suzy and himself. She brings books -- she loves adventure stories the best -- and her binoculars which always hang around her neck. One day in the woods Suzy spots a deer. ""He knows someones watching"" she says about the animal as it stares back. ""He can feel us."" The same could be said of the characters in Moonrise Kingdom They know were watching them and theyre OK with it but theyre not going to put on a show for us. Like the rest of Wes Andersons films (Rushmore The Royal Tenenbaums Fantastic Mr. Fox) the movie has a deliberate archness a sense of theatricality that makes you want to hang a frame around the edges of the screen. In the past that aesthetic sometimes led to cold fussy pictures (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou The Darjeeling Limited). But Moonrise Kingdom is different because it feels personal and earnest its situations drawn from real life instead of art its emotions honest its affection genuine. Most importantly Anderson -- who wrote the screenplay with Roman Coppola -- has an actual story to tell. Moonrise Kingdom is set in a fictional world in 1965 -- which the director seems to have imagined from the ground up from the covers of the books Suzy reads to the jackets of record albums to the indelible colors of rotary telephones. The opening credits put the names of the actors in the extreme corners of the screen as if to let you know to search every frame of the movie because there are little treasures everywhere. Andersons precise attention to detail doesnt get in the way of the story It heightens the pleasures of Moonrise Kingdom which features Bruce Willis as the worlds saddest sheriff; Bill Murray and Frances McDormand as a pair of husband-and-wife attorneys headed for divorce; Edward Norton as a fastidious scout leader who tasks his charges with unusual hilariously dangerous missions; Bob Balaban as a narrator who keeps warning us about an approaching storm; and Tilda Swinton as a bureaucratic social-services worker named Social Services. But the true stars of the movie are Gilman and Hayward who look and talk like real kids and whose sweet awkward endearing romance will remind you of your first true love regardless of how old you were when it happened. Moonrise Kingdom isnt a movie about childhood Its a movie about how we remember childhood when confrontations with other kids seemed to have life-or-death stakes grown-ups spoke about things we didnt understand or care about and it really was possible to run away and go on a wild adventure as long as you brought the proper supplies. The film is precious and adorable but it isnt naive (these kids are becoming sexually aware) and the movie breathes so deep that Anderson even gets a real performance out of Willis (this is his best work in years). Most of Andersons previous pictures came from the head; Moonrise Kingdom is one from the heart.

(AP Photo/Focus Features Niko Tavernise) Romeo and Juliet. Rhett and Scarlett. Clark and Lois. To the pantheon of great romantic couples we hereby welcome Sam and Suzy the tween runaways in Wes Andersons ""Moonrise Kingdom"" the best film of the year and perhaps the purest love story in cinematic history.Whereas most movie twosomes are adults with differing personalities 12-year-olds Sam and Suzy (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) are soulmates from the moment they meet in the halcyon summer of 64. At a community playhouse on an island off Maine Sam spots Suzy and for a year they write letters comparing their lives.Sam is an orphan in foster care and a member of the adventuresome Khaki Scouts. Suzy is the daughter of estranged parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and an avid reader of girl-powered adventure novels. After a year they conspire to meet in an Eden by the sea. Sam brings a canoe and a pocket knife. Suzy brings a kitten and a portable record player. While the wide-eyed would-be lovers greet each other with welcoming curiosity their absence is slowly noticed by the islands grown-ups including the scoutmaster (Ed Norton) and the sheriff (Bruce Willis). As enforcers search the island for the runaways gnomish narrator Bob Balaban notes that the storm of the decade is approaching.""Moonrise Kingdom"" has a fairy-tale framework. With his coonskin cap and air rifle Sam is a protective Peter Pan while Suzy is Sleeping Beauty freed from her castle and ferried to a blue lagoon.Even in a nature setting Anderson maintains his trademark pop palette and symmetrical compositions; yet here the stylized visuals serve a story thats sweet and layered. Willis is a standout among the adult actors and Norton is newly likable as the lonesome scoutmaster. But the movie belongs to newcomers Gilman and Heyward who are as frank and precocious as characters in a J.D. Salinger story.Phonies may complain that Andersons island of misfit toys is a retreat from the real world but for pure-hearted adventurers who share the secret map ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a joy that cannot be eclipsed.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In 1965 two 12-year-olds run away from a small New England town. RATING PG-13 (sexual themes smoking) BOTTOM LINE Wes Andersons latest is a bit too Andersonian quirky charming and overly fond of itself. CAST Bruce Willis Tilda Swinton Bill Murray Frances McDormand LENGTH 140 ""Moonrise Kingdom"" the story of two 12-year-old lovers who run away from their New England homes during the summer of 1965 may be Wes Andersons most Andersonian movie yet. Its his clearest realization of an idealized adolescence made up of Mike Nichols ""The Graduate"" Hal Ashbys ""Harold and Maude"" and J.D. Salingers ""The Catcher in the Rye."" But adolescence is a trap if you cant leave it behind. In ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" Anderson paid homage to his boyhood influences but in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" he seems to forget that they were also stories about growing up. As a result ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a film of affectations and poses that mimic emotional depth without achieving it. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? That of course is exactly what adolescents do. Precocious misfits Sam and Suzy (first-time actors Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward both 12 during filming) are clearly playing at adulthood Out in the woods they shack up in a tent (Sam is a decorated ""Khaki Scout"") and even find a way to get married. Suzy comes from unhappy parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) though Sam is a foster child whos so independent and confident he feels like a wish fulfillment for Anderson. Shot in the grainy yellows of Kodachrome snapshots and crammed with period details (vinyl records endless cigarettes) ""Moonrise Kingdom"" both pines for an innocent era and mocks it. Edward Norton plays a grown man in a Scout uniform Tilda Swinton is an icy bureaucrat named Social Services and Bridgehamptons Bob Balaban narrates with deadpan sarcasm. The films two young stars either cant act or more likely werent allowed to; aside from a rather moving Bruce Willis as a lonely cop everyone here is playing a costume not a role. Though undeniably smart and charming ""Moonrise Kingdom"" loves itself the way the callow Holden Caulfield loves himself unconditionally. Salinger understood the problem with that. Anderson may not. 159 VideoMoonrise Kingdom PLOT In 1965 two 12-year-olds run away from a small New England town.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In 1965 on a New England island 12-year-old scout Sam (Jared Gilman) and local girl Suzy (Kara Hayward) elope. He brings maps and his coonskin cap. She packs a suitcase full of books a portable record player and a kitten. They pitch tents on a remote beach and dance to soulful French pop songs. Her bickering parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) his stuffy scoutmaster (Edward Norton) and the milquetoast local sheriff (Bruce Willis) launch a hunt. The other Scouts join the search with Dionysian zeal packing their hatchets and Bowie knives in case Sam resists. Theres even bigger trouble brewing. The local cartographer (Bob Balaban) warns us the island is about to be battered by the mother of all storms. Welcome to ""Moonrise Kingdom"" the latest unadulterated delight from Wes Anderson director of ""Rushmore"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" Like fennel Bob Dylans voice and the comic novels of P.G. Wodehouse Andersons stylized films may be an acquired taste. Too bad for those who dont appreciate them. Every Anderson movie creates a playful hermetic world where arch humor duels with romantic melancholy. The sets resemble dollhouse interiors and the performances are big. His special gift isnt his persnickety art direction nor his knack for enticing megastars into eccentric roles. Its his ability to create a comic gulf between how his characters see themselves and our view of them. Briskly paced and jam-packed with visual gags ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a family-movie heartwarmer like no other. Watching it is like shuffling through a shoebox of fading photos and silly mementos. Its shot on 16-millimeter stock that gives the images a warm buttery Kodachrome nostalgia perfectly in key with the films anachronistic humor. Murrays collection of old-school patchwork madras trousers is a running joke. While Sam and Suzy play at being grownups the man-child scoutmaster and his commander (Harvey Keitel) wear uniform shorts and neckerchiefs that make them look like overgrown Cub Scouts. Anderson and his screenwriting collaborator Roman Coppola give us a world before helicopter parents where adults nonchalantly allow kids to fiddle with kerosene and gunpowder unsupervised. Theres a great scene where the sheriff has a heart-to-heart with Sam about the challenges of romance in adulthood. He pours the boy a beer a gesture that nowadays would surely trigger a federal investigation. The movie recaptures an innocent emotional landscape that has vanished forever. Though hes often accused of hipster irony theres not a cynical bone in Andersons body. He thinks with his heart. Part of whats so touching about ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is its atmosphere of naive hopefulness. The film is about how kids -- and adults -- need to get out of themselves and connect. Theres the intoxicating puppy love of the youngest characters who meet at Suzys church production of the Noah story. Sams an orphan. Suzy feels like one. On their isolated island each is the only person who understands the other. Later we see a halfhearted dalliance between two adult characters and the ash heap of regrets dividing Suzys parents who are both lawyers. Focus Features Star Tribune Kara Hayward as Suzy and Jared Gilman as Sam in ""Moonrise Kingdom."" The climax amid the big typhoon has one inhibited character rising to the occasion reaching out heroically to link up with others. The only antagonist is an officious social-services bureaucrat played by Tilda Swinton who wants to pack Sam off to an orphanage. Dressed in a neo-Victorian tunic cape and bonnet shes what youd get if Cruella de Vil joined the Salvation Army. In the end even her flinty heart softens. Its hard to imagine a viewer who wont feel the same. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 In a flurry of recent interviews Wes Anderson - the corduroyed auteur behind Rushmore The Royal Tenenbaums and other films about dreamers and depressives who move to a decidedly retro beat - has said his experience on Fantastic Mr. Fox changed his whole approach to moviemaking. More about Moonrise Kingdom >> Working with little puppets and tiny props building forests and towns in impeccable detail - as he and his crew did in that 2009 Oscar-nominated animated feature - prompted Anderson to realize he could create similarly exact and fanciful worlds for his flesh-and-blood actors too. Of course he was already kind of doing that. Even The Darjeeling Limited shot in India imagined a kind of niftier more eccentrically arranged subcontinent. But in Moonrise Kingdom the exhilarating tale of two very young lovers on the lam Anderson has created a kind of moving diorama of drama and deadpan. A concocted coastal New England in an idyllic mid-60s moment of coonskin caps Francoise Hardy 45s (with picture sleeves) and dads in madras pants who drink too much is zealously contained within the cameras frame and even when something goes out of control - a flyaway motorcycle an epic downpour - it doesnt. Wes Anderson is in the wheelhouse - his wheelhouse. Written by the director in cahoots with his filmmaking friend Roman Coppola Moonrise Kingdom is about 12-year-old Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and 12-year-old Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) whom he first spies in a bird costume (for a play) is immediately smitten with and with whom he enters into a secret correspondence that ends with a plan to run away together. Hes at Camp Ivanhoe a scout facility on an island ringed by sound and sea. She lives with her family (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand are the parents and there are two younger brothers) on the other side of New Penzance in Summers End a comfortably ramshackle abode near the islands lighthouse. They meet in a meadow. He has a backpack full of camping gear maps and supplies. She has a portable record player and a cat poking its head out of a wicker creel. Theyre off And so are a disgruntled mom and dad (Suzys) a flustered camp leader (Edward Norton) Sams fellow khaki scouts (none of them like him) a fox terrier and the town sheriff (a surprisingly sympathetic tamped-down Bruce Willis). Its a search party with its own issues its own fractured esprit de corps. Moonrise Kingdom is about the raptures of falling in love about how the rest of the world doesnt matter one whit when you lock eyes with the person of your dreams - even if (perhaps especially if) you happen to be in middle school. Gilman and Hayward neither of them exhibiting any professional kid-actor attitude are wonderful - making-believe with awkward conviction even getting a little risque in a beach scene with French kissing. (Dont fret This is not Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerrs From Here to Eternity tidal clinch.) The usual complaints and caveats about Anderson - hes precious his characters have no grounding in the real world - can be made about Moonrise Kingdom but so what? This is his seventh feature he has been working with a gang of collaborators in front of the camera and behind and his worldview gets richer and more revealing even as the view from his lens gets smaller closer almost two-dimensional in its oddball tableaux.

Moonrise Kingdom Good to great Director Wes Anderson. Cast Jared Gilman Kara Hayward Bill Murray. Rating PG-13 for sexual content and smoking. Note At Harkins Camelview. Thats certainly the case in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" Andersons wonderful new film. A panning shot of one familys home could be mistaken for the inside of a doll house except its not. Everything about the film is similarly artificial in its construction -- the story the dialogue the acting -- and yet it all works because Anderson and his actors are able to convey more genuine feeling through these devices than most filmmakers can with more-traditional means. The film which takes place in 1965 introduces us to Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) who lives with her three younger brothers and their parents Walt and Laura (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) in a lighthouse on the fictional island of New Penzance. Suzy has a thing for binoculars through which she constantly peers as if searching for something. Meanwhile at a Khaki Scout camp scout master Ward (Edward Norton) notices that one of his scouts is missing. Its Sam (Jared Gilman) a bespectacled boy who isnt especially popular among his fellow scouts. Ward notifies police Capt. Sharp (Bruce Willis) who in turn calls the foster home where Sam lives and gets a surprising response. It turns out that Sam and Suzy have a plan. They met a year earlier at a performance of ""Noyes Fludde"" (composer Benjamin Britten figures somewhat prominently throughout) and were instantly smitten. Months of exchanged letters lead to this They are going to run away together. On the small island on which they live. Happily for them Sam seems to have picked up a lot of outdoorsy skills. Their courtship is sweet ridiculous crazy wonderful. Its the kind of young love (theyre 12) that leads to piercing ears with fishhooks -- and loving it (despite the screams). A goofy dance bit leads to a perfectly uncomfortable make-out scene. All the while the islands residents including the scouts are searching in earnest; thats crucial because a huge storm is moving toward the island. Along the way other details are revealed. Walt and Laura both lawyers are not exactly an idyllic couple. Like nearly everyone else in the movie theyre damaged in fairly significant ways (Suzy found a booklet on top of the refrigerator titled ""Coping With the Very Troubled Child""). Indeed a sense of sadness permeates the proceedings balancing the sometimes laugh-out-loud absurdities that Anderson and co-writer Roman Coppola throw our way with regularity. Late in the game Tilda Swinton Harvey Keitel and Anderson pal Jason Schwartzman show up in smaller roles welcome as always and reliably strong though hardly essential to the films success. Like everything else in the movie they simply fit. There isnt a false note among the performances. Its the first movie for Hayward and Gilman; whatever awkwardness they display is appropriate. Willis may never have been better. Norton is fantastic. Murray and McDormand are also ... well you get the idea. As previously noted whimsy abounds but it doesnt dominate. There is real danger here real sadness real heartbreak real pain. A bedroom apology scene between Murray and McDormand is shattering and brilliant. Anderson sprinkles this kind of thing throughout and it raises the stakes. Taken as a whole ""Moonrise Kingdom"" may not be particularly believable. On the other hand it never stops giving us something to believe in. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

"Moonrise Kingdom | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; moonrise-kingdom ) Moonrise Kingdom (United States 2012) June 05 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Few working directors are as consistently dependably quirky as Wes Anderson whose films tend to excite art house audiences while being ignored and bypassed by mainstream movie-goers. His latest Moonrise Kingdom represents one of his best in large part because it tones down some of the more abstruse elements of his style in favor of greater accessibility and stronger character identification. One knock against some of Andersons previous efforts is that theyre too clever - so clever in fact that the humanity gets sucked out of them. That doesnt happen here. Moonrise Kingdom is lovingly crafted with an attention to detail that is breathtaking while at the same time it displays genuine affection for its young protagonists reserving any cynicism for the adults who can be said to more closely resemble typical ""Anderson characters."" Few things in life are more urgent and transcendent than a pre-teen romance embarked upon at a time before sexual desire has crystallized beyond a vague curiosity and ""love"" is a term for which true meaning remains elusive. The writers of Moonrise Kingdom Wes Anderson and Ramon Coppola have excellent memories. Both are in their 40s (Coppola was born in 1965 Anderson in 1969) yet they have brought this story to the screen through the eyes of 12-year olds. Therein lies the movies route to success; it gets us to remember our youth and imagine how things might have been for us in these circumstances. The movies innate innocence springs from its adoption of this viewpoint. And it builds the perspective by subtle cues and easy-to-miss details that feed directly into the viewers subconscious. Neither Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) nor Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) could be described as ""normal"" or ""well-adjusted."" Both are whip-smart and headstrong. Sam is an orphan who has become such a tribulation to his foster parents that he is not being invited back after spending his summer at a boy scout camp on a New England island. Suzy a resident of the appropriately-named Summers End corner of the island is the bane of her family; her parents have bought a how-to book about coping with a ""troubled child."" In each other however they have found a soul-mate so they do what soul mates often do run away together. The fly in the ointment so to speak is their age. They want to get married but they dont have a license lack parental permission and fail to meet the minimum age requirement allowed by law. Not that such things make much difference to them. The sense of time and place couldnt be more forcefully presented. The year is 1965 and the location is a sparsely-populated island off the New England coast. Anderson has elected to shoot the movie much as it might have been made during the 60s and it is suffused with a warm sepia tinge - the color of nostalgia. The camera prefers tracking shots to close-ups and passes through walls to offer a cross-section of a house where some of the action transpires. Local history is provided via Bob Balaban who functions as a narrator offering the kinds of observations one might find in a promotional period short. Theres an undeniable tongue-in-cheek element to this but it serves its purpose. The concept of young love is certainly not unique but the tact employed by Anderson is. The leads are likeable and appealing but each possesses offbeat distinguishing traits. Suzy is never without her binoculars and Sam had taken up pipe smoking. Their physical and emotional ages might be 12 but they are smarter than most of the adults they encounter - a fact explicitly acknowledged by one in a moment of candor. They share a scene that is equal parts tenderness and awkwardness - a first kiss a first grope a first acknowledgment of arousal. Moonrise Kingdom is never salacious and sex is never much of an issue. Intimacy between the leads while they are on their own means reading to one another and absorbing the adventure of being in the wilderness without supervision. Sam and Suzy claim to have found ""love"" with each other; what they have discovered in fact is friendship - something neither has experience with. Roughly half the running time is devoted to following the journey of Sam and Suzy as they wander from one dubious milestone to another on what is not a very large island. Their misadventures are interwoven with the efforts of adults to find them. These include Suzys parents Walt and Laura Bishop (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand); the scout master in charge of Sams troupe Ward (Edward Norton); and the local head of police Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). Later in the film there are appearances by several other recognizable faces Tilda Swinton as the local representative of Social Services Jason Schwartzman as a helpful scout leader; and Harvey Keitel as the hard-assed commander of all scouts. Anderson should be credited for casting two excellent unknowns in their first major film roles. Both Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman become their characters exhibiting none of the stiltedness and uncertainty that sometimes accompanies neophytes. Their performances are natural; their chemistry is immediate and unforced. During the scenes when they alone occupy the screen we see the world through their eyes without the distracting filter of an adult perspective. In a turnaround not unexpected from Anderson its the adults who come across as immature and silly. Moonrise Kingdom reminded me a little of A Bridge to Terabithia although the tones are different. The magical realism of the earlier film is barely hinted at here and Moonrise Kingdom is more comedy than fantasy or drama. Both films however are founded on a strong connection between children of the opposite sex; that affection provides viewers with an easy point of entry. Of course this being a Wes Anderson film the comedy is often a little off-kilter frequently deadpan and rarely of the laugh-aloud roll-on-the-floor variety. The movie is funny in an intellectual low-key manner but it is not as obscure or obtuse as that which defined The Darjeeling Limited or The Royal Tenenbaums. With Moonrise Kingdom Anderson has blended the strengths evident in his past endeavors with a well-constructed emotionally resonant story. The result is a pleasing 90 minute idyll.

Focus Features There was a time following the jolt of intergenerational perplexity that was Rushmore when Wes Andersons career seemed set on a disappointing trajectory the almost suffocating portraiture of The Royal Tenenbaums; the choppy half-hearted absurdism of The Life Aquatic; the borderline distasteful ethno-tourism of The Darjeeling Limited. The script captures the texture of childhood summers the sense of having a limited amount of time in which to do unlimited things. And then the re-set. By supplying him with an original text and a format--stop-motion animation--so twee as to be essentially twee-proof Fantastic Mr. Fox enabled Anderson to jump the track of his own roller-coaster descent. Judging from his latest Moonrise Kingdom his promising new course has stuck. The film is Andersons best live-action feature--his best feature period--since Rushmore in part because like that film it takes as its primary subject matter odd precocious children rather than the damaged and dissatisfied adults they will one day become. The movie which takes place in 1965 opens with a cross-stitch portrait of a red New England vacation home with its own small built-in lighthouse. The portrait we soon see hangs in that selfsame red vacation home. (Yes this is a Wes Anderson movie.) This is the warm-weather abode of Walt and Laura Bishop (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) two attorneys who have been drifting apart their marital estrangement signified by the name of the property Summers End. But this is only peripherally the story of Walt and Laura or of their three young sons. Rather it is the tale of their ""difficult"" eldest child 12-year-old Suzy (Kara Hayward) and another young misfit with whom she--there really is no better word for it--elopes. This would be Sam (Jared Gilman) a serious bespectacled and unpopular boy who fell in love with Suzy the prior year when he saw her playing the raven in a summer production of Benjamin Brittens Noyes Fludde. (It is one of several references to the composer in the film.) Sam goes AWOL from his troop of Khaki Scouts at nearby Camp Ivanhoe to rendezvous with Suzy. United the two disappear into the wooded thickets of New Penzance Island--the name itself is worth the price of admission--Suzy with her binoculars and pastel suitcases and battery-powered record player; Sam with his coonskin cap and corncob pipe and abundance of camping gear. There in the dappled forests and sunswept coves the two young runaways discover freedom and companionship and the early innocent rumblings of sex. As they follow their trail of pseudo-maturity they are of course sought after by an escalatingly (and understandably) frantic brigade of adults Suzys parents the local police captain (Bruce Willis) and Sams scoutmaster (Edward Norton). As this last informs the young scouts hes dragooned into the hunt ""This is not just a rescue party. This is a great scouting opportunity."" The book is awash with echoes of childrens adventure fiction from Tom Sawyer to Treasure Island to A High Wind in Jamaica. Underage though they may be the kids are resourceful optimistic capable of loyalty and love--all the qualities with which their elders struggle. Its worth noting that this is the rare tale set in 1965 in which most of the adults are single and the one marriage to which we are introduced is an unhappy one. (Well the one legally binding marriage I should cite here a hilarious cameo by Jason Schwartzman as a renegade scoutmaster with a weakness for performing age-inappropriate matrimonies.) MORE ON MOVIES Snow White amp; the Huntsman Dazzling Visuals and Not Much Else Where Have All the Gigantic Nuclear-Powered Horror Monsters Gone? 10 Cannes Films Youll Probably Want to See Our Picks for Which Film to Catch Each Week of Summer The De-Disneyfication of Fairy Tales Moonrise Kingdom is touching bittersweet and very very funny. Cinematographer Robert Yeoman Andersons usual collaborator evokes the the feel of New England (the film was shot in Rhode Island) so precisely that the storys locale need never be mentioned. And the script by Anderson with Roman Coppola captures the indolent yet enterprising texture of childhood summers the sense of having a limited amount of time in which to do unlimited things. The performances are excellent across the board from the adults who recognize that their best is never quite good enough to the kids who realize they will be forced to make up the deficit. On the former side Norton and (particularly) Willis are standouts; on the latter newcomer Gilman as Sam offers a portrait of a boy trying to will himself into premature manhood so indelible that it can almost almost compete with (then-newcomer) Schwartzmans Max Fischer in Rushmore. This should hardly come as a surprise. Andersons forays into the travails of adulthood--even young-adulthood as in Tenenbaums and Darjeeling--have never been as moving as his examinations of the triumphs and complications of precocious youth. Sam and Suzy will no doubt one day be like Walt and Laura Bishop or Royal Tenenbaum or Steve Zissou encumbered with disappointment and regret with jobs and kids and spouses and houses. But for now they are still alive to a world whose possibilities are constrained only by resolve and ingenuity both of which they have in abundance. With Fantastic Mr. Fox Anderson made a kids movie for grownups; with Moonrise Kingdom he has made a grownup movie about kids. It may lack the glorious ferocity and tenderness of Where the Wild Things Are--another film about an island runaway and the new family he tries to construct. Yet in its whimsical way it raises the same questions about how children are to navigate passage through a world so full of flawed adults. At one point in the film Laura Bishop reminds her husband that they must persevere for the sake of the kids ""Were all theyve got Walt."" He replies ""Thats not enough."" Of course it isnt. It never has been and never will be. But somehow they find their way through nonetheless.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed.

Starring Bruce Willis Edward Norton Bill Murray Tilda Swinton Jason Schwartzman Frances McDormand Jared Gilman Kara Hayward. Director Wes Anderson Running time 133 Release Opened Jun 1 2012  Editorial Review Adolescent love among eccentricsBy Ann HornadayFriday June 1 2012""Moonrise Kingdom"" opens with no music -- just the sound of raindrops falling on the roof of a preternaturally cozy house which the camera gently leads the audience through as the family members inside go about their rainy-day business. Bathed in apple reds egg-yolk yellows and an air of studied eccentricity the house is immediately recognizable as yet another habitat created by Wes Anderson a film director whose obsession with material culture nostalgia and nursery comforts borders on the fetishistic. Of course for viewers who happen to share Andersons taste for boldly framed bespoke productions -- in which everything looks (and most probably is) lovingly handmade and artisanal ""Moonrise Kingdom"" will simply offer yet another chance to live at least for a little while in the kind of universe only Anderson can create. (You can almost smell the damp canvas and wood polish in that opening sequence.) Those who long ago wrote off the writer-director as insufferably mannered and arcane -- the usual term of art is ""twee"" -- well theyre welcome to stay out in the rain. That opening-scene house has a name by the way Summers End which turns out to aptly capture a vaguely autumnal tale of young love that takes place in early September 1965 -- a time of Ford Falcons and mothers who smoked. The 12-year-old girl who lives in the house Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) wears miniskirts with her scuffed saddle shoes and daring blue eyeshadow that wouldnt be out of place on Carnaby Street. (Bearing a faint resemblance to Emma Watson Hayward possesses a similarly compelling face for the screen especially when she fixes the camera with a dark adamantine stare.) In the past year Suzy has struck up a pen-pal friendship with Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) a bespectacled raccoon-tail-capped kid who as ""Moonrise Kingdom"" begins has just run away from Khaki Scout camp. As explained by a nameless narrator played by Bob Balaban (looking every inch the Christmas elf in a Technicolor-red winter coat and jaunty green cap) ""Moonrise Kingdom"" will chronicle the adventures of Sam and Suzy each of whom is woefully misunderstood by the adults in his or her life. In Suzys case those grown-ups are a couple of preoccupied lawyers (Frances McDormand and Bill Murray) one of whom is a little more preoccupied than the other. Which brings us to the supporting players in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" Bruce Willis portrays the police chief (and apparently sole police officer) on the small New England island where the story takes place; if you think his mild-mannered Capt. Sharp represents a departure from his ""Die Hard"" days just wait until the third act. Edward Norton plays Khaki Scout master Ward who swiftly organizes a squad of kerchiefed boys to use their ""wilderness and orienteering skills"" to track down their peer (hes not exactly a friend because hes the most unpopular kid in the group). And Tilda Swinton dons a perfectly swirled and lacquered red wig to play an imperious bureaucrat whos known in the film simply as ""Social Services."" As hes done in all of his films -- from ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" through ""The Darjeeling Limited"" and animated ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" -- Anderson confects a distinctive mix of arch humor and solemnity in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" in which Sam and Suzy confront death abandonment and burgeoning sexuality in very real terms but in which a character can also be struck by lightning without suffering anything worse than a pair of sooty glasses. Leaning heavily on a leitmotif of Noahs Ark -- and a lovely performance of the Benjamin Britten opera ""Noyes Fludde"" -- Anderson weaves an alternately soothing and unsettling mythology of young love never allowing the audience for one moment to dismiss or condescend to the films supremely solemn and earnest adolescent protagonists. Still if Anderson deserves credit for giving Sam and Suzy their dignity his controlled airless approach to the story has also sapped it of the headlong emotionalism that such reckless passions entail. As in all of his films Andersons characters speak in affectless matter-of-fact sentences a style that was fresh and altogether suitable for the wise-beyond-his-years Max Fischer in ""Rushmore"" but here creates a chilly intellectual distance. With its love of bygone eras and Etsy-esque aesthetic of hand-sewn costumes and felt scout badges ""Moonrise Kingdom"" begins to take on the meticulously crafted trappings a live-action human version of ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" especially during a particularly antic climax where busy-ness and unhinged action finally swamp deeper meaning. Everything has been so carefully curated and rigidly controlled in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" that the film begins to feel as precious and meticulously composed as one of the books that Suzy brings on her journey (along with a pair of left-handed scissors and a kitten). Still theres no denying the extravagant pleasures ""Moonrise Kingdom"" affords as an erudite wish-fulfillment fantasy of empowerment and autonomy. Andersons style may not be to everyones taste but hes that rare -- maybe even unique -- filmmaker who seems interested in exploring film not just as a vehicle for narrative but as a material object in and of itself. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is already shaping up to be this summers art house sleeper hit and no wonder It traffics in the very kind of escapist spectacle -- in this case of a thoughtfully composed world brimming with whimsy enchantment and visual brio -- that the season was made for.Contains sexual content and smoking.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 01 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Mar. 13 2014 230PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Wes Anderson Written by Wes Anderson Roman Coppola Starring Kara Hayward Jared Gilman Classification PG Year 2012 Country USA Language English Last time out in Fantastic Mr. Fox Wes Anderson adapted a childrens book by Roald Dahl. Now in Moonrise Kingdom hes made one of his own. Of course his detractors (as ardent as his fans - this guy definitely elicits strong feelings) will counter that every Anderson film exists in some fractured fairy tale world where dysfunctional adults never grow up but instead infantilized in their psychic playground do little more than teeter-totter between downright childish and merely childlike. Here hes answered those critics by kicking his so-called grownups to the edges of the screen and investing their characteristics where they naturally belong - in a couple of actual 12-year-old children. This is their show and they are its stars. Multimedia Moonrise Kingdom - Trailer Bill Murray and Bruce Willis talk about Moonrise at Cannes. Joel Ryan / AP Movies Video Moonrise Kingdom opens at Cannes But if that investment is ""natural"" nothing else in this movie is not even remotely. Even by his stylistic standards Anderson has cranked up the artifice starting with a trademark opening shot - a slow tracking symmetrically framed across the cut-out rooms of a clapboard home nestled by the sea. The place is New England on ""the island of New Penzance"" and the date is 1965 although not so youd know it. In the parlour their ears pressed to the radio the children are shunning the Beatles for a whole other Britten - Benjamin - whose classic strains dominate the score. The time is clearly out of joint.So are many other things including the wondrous maturity of our young stars. Suzy (Kara Hayward) is first spotted peering through her ever-present binoculars - she sees further than the screwed-up adults around her certainly further than her squabbling parents his and hers lawyers who keep cross-examining each other. Mom (Frances McDormand) is having an affair with the local cop (Bruce Willis); for his part Dad (Bill Murray) either doesnt notice or doesnt care - it amounts to the same.In her own candid admission Suzy is ""depressed"" by the domestic discord and thus does what any smart 12-year-old would She runs away. Her partner in flight is Sam (Jared Gilman) an orphan who bolts from his Scout troop the one run with military rigour by its leader. That would be Scout Master Ward (Ed Norton) another suspicious mess - hes rather too fond of having little boys under his command.Even for Anderson devotees these early scenes will seem gratingly precious - the artifice just seems well artificial. But the charm kicks in when the kids take off into the woods through the Labour Day weekend for their Late-Summer Nights Dream. Indeed later on when a tempest brews over the island the playful nods to Shakespeare grow more vigorous. And when Bob Balaban pops up as a Puckish narrator the deal is sealed - this New England owes a magical debt to that old one where sprites roamed free and young love triumphed.So back to our star-crossed duo Sam armed with an air-rifle his glasses perched beneath a coonskin hat; Suzy with her blue eye-liner and pink polka dot dress and cache of romance novels; both on the cusp of adolescence and feeling those stirrings that are not yet carnal and not quite innocent but so immaculately pure. Love unblemished by experience untainted by compromise. Whos to deny its worth?Not us at least not in a gorgeous scene by the title cove. There on the secluded beach of Moonrise Kingdom the pair garland their hair and a song leads to a dance which culminates in a kiss. Suddenly the penny drops and we see the method in Andersons mad fable These kids are the true flower children these are the sixties that never were but should have been.The rest is an antic chase by search parties leading to the climax where the storm breaks and lightning strikes. En route the formidable senior cast - Murray McDormand Norton and Tilda Swinton as a robotic Social Services apparatchik - all seem to fade into the background as slim as their damaged characters. But the callow hero and heroine fixed in that precious moment of development when the heart speaks truths that the head has yet to deny seize centre stage and our rapt attention. Especially when on that moonlit idyll he asks ""What do you want to do when you grow up?"" and she simply replies ""Go on adventures."" Such profound words at 12 and then so profoundly hard to live by. Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts More Related to this Story Wes Anderson at Cannes Quoi?

Directed by Wes Anderson. Starring Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward. (PG-13. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Moonrise Kingdom"" opens on the colorful knit portrait of a beachside manse and theres no better intro to this bright bewitching island fable streaked with yellow. Its an adventure a love story a biblical allegory complete with approaching storm a mash note to composer Benjamin Britten and a profoundly touching discourse on the needs of troubled children. Two of them grab hold - of each other and us - in ""Moonrise"" which follows 12-year-old misfits Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) on their cross-island trek to freedom. Sam a Scout in a snappy mustard kerchief hauls around hiking gear for every contingency. Suzy brings binoculars a portable record player and an assortment of library books. But mainly they have each other. And as they tumble and fumble toward prepubescent love what theyre actually reaching for is refuge from a social order that considers them dangerous and strange. So goes the latest effort from director Wes Anderson the great and visionary flake of his generation. From his first film (the chillin road movie ""Bottle Rocket"") to his last (the stop-motion caper ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"") hes exhibited an affection for eccentrics and outcasts that goes well beyond the usual indie-arthouse taste for bourgeois coolness. Also obvious is his fondness for artificial worlds - high school submarines trains - thats only become more mannered and music-boxy over the years. But in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" all of Andersons habits and gifts coalesce on a film that conjures the fairy-tale strangeness of everyday life. The world of fictitious New Penzance Island is as artificial whimsical and precisely assembled as any other in Andersons oeuvre but it breathes. It breathes because it takes place primarily outdoors in the huddled trees and dappled waters off New England - and because its characters huff puff and climb down from the screen. Andersons screenplay co-written with Roman Coppola is orchestrated as meticulously as the myriad Britten works excerpted on the soundtrack Its colors themes characters and precisely calibrated dollhouse camerawork build to a tutti as thundering as any symphonys. Those might be woodwinds we hear or they might be the deft phrasing of fine supporting turns by Bill Murray and Frances McDormand as Suzys muddled parents; Bruce Willis as a sad-sack cop; and Edward Norton as a by-the-book but gently caring Scout leader. ""Poems dont always have to rhyme you know. Theyre just supposed to be creative"" Sam explains to Suzy in the thick of their journey. The formality of ""Moonrise Kingdom"" - the orderly structure and dreamlike perfection of it all - is as poetic as any film Ive seen this year.   Amy Biancolli is a Hearst movie writer.

Fourteen years ago I bounced out of my seat at the end of Wes Andersons ""Rushmore."" It was one of the happiest moments of my moviegoing life. Anderson had appropriated the French New Wave in order to honor this very particular type of young American attitude. It was mock-sophisticated and actually sophisticated pretentious and unpretentious arch but sincere - this impossible balance of snobbery warmth and pseudo-adolescent craftsmanship. Were you so inclined it was the sort of movie you would have made about your own high-school experience - a comedy that exalted your brilliance ""Ferris Bueller"" with a much higher SAT score. When it was over I just kept saying ""yes yes yes.""Anderson was talented. He had a voice. His movie was also - in this droll self-styled manner - cool. ""Rushmore"" was a promise of future greatness. But the future was long in arriving. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" got a lot of the way there but Andersons ideas of adultness paled in comparison to the real thing. It was a pantomime of maturity. The movies that followed it were like isolationist tantrums full of painstaking moviemaking but bereft of breathable air. One was a fiasco set on a submarine. The next was set mostly on a moving train - in India a country Anderson ultimately couldnt be bothered culturally to explore. He wasnt growing. He was making socially illiterate coffee-table movies.But sometimes you stick with a director because despite his blind spots and fetishes you believe in him. Something about what he once did lingers in this perfect permanent way. Youre tattooed. So movie after movie you wait. Hes come so close so often that its only a matter of time until he figures out how to do it how to be the director he promised to become. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is Andersons seventh movie and its the first since ""Rushmore"" that works from the opening shot to the final image.Andersons partisans think hes already figured it out that he was getting stronger. Its not true. When oh when would he combine his aesthetic obsessions (the francophilia the Americana the prep-schoolery) with his natural wit and the heart you assume he had? I love the meticulous diorama framing and the hoisting pivoting dumbwaitered nearly hydraulic camerawork. I would even tolerate the dollhouse framing. I just didnt want the dolls. I wanted Anderson to show me a soul. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" does that.The movie has a manageable premise. Anderson wrote it with his friend Roman Coppola (Franciss son) and it feels utterly real vividly dreamt and totally remembered. Suzy and Sam (Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman) are about 12. They meet write each other letters and plot a secret summer getaway to a remote part of their fictitious New England island - New Penzance (). The films set in 1965 so letters have a pleasing sense of romantic drama which Anderson and his editor heighten in an amusing montage that cuts off each thought not far into a paragraph in order to begin the next letter already in progress. Whats recalled is that pen-pal love is unlike any other smaller in scale than the great epistolary correspondences and more theatrical than most e-mails. Suzy and Sam are falling in love with both each other and the idea of love. Theyre also trying out personas. Suzy wears knee-highs saddle shoes and mini-dresses. Her eye makeup is smoky. Shes playing with the surfaces of her budding sexuality. Sam is a nerd who thinks scouting licenses him to be manlier than he is. Of course her almost mythological violent tendencies (they happen off-screen) turn out to be more darkly tough than anything roiling Sam. To be together she flees her trio of younger brothers and her dour father and mother (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand). He sneaks away from his scouting program. What ensues is a search party comprising her parents his suddenly hapless scoutmaster (Edward Norton) the local sheriff (Bruce Willis) and about half a dozen scouts who think Sam was mildly exasperating but discover his back story and pity him. The action transpires across a couple of days and culminates with the arrival of Tilda Swinton aptly cast as a bureaucratic entity credited only as ""Social Services."" Her red bouffant is gray at the temples and her clenched air is all Maggie Smith.Anderson seems to enjoy the opportunity to tell a story - and edit it - as crisply as he can. He and Coppola have devised a collection of characters who only loosely feel like types. You can feel even a part like a handsome scout nicknamed Redford become something slightly more than a throwaway villain. The adult stuff here among Murray McDormand and Willis feels simple but private and true in the way a child can think he knows adult feelings but mistakes their depth. Each actor wears a sadness that never hardens into a mask of tragedy.The achievement here is the marriage of that resonant pathos with Andersons peerless sense of graphic design. You see all his influences - the French movies and Norman Rockwell to start with - and you know hes seen those films and paintings and wanted desperately to climb inside them. Anderson inspires the same gluttonous spectatorship. You want to eat his movies. You want to wear them. That used to be all he had - this meticulous style and clubby approach to ensemble work that managed only to keep you out. We could spectate but we couldnt feel much. The movies were all influence - wallpaper without any walls. Now when Bob Balaban narrates ""Moonrise Kingdom"" while striking poses in duck-boots and a wool coat the color of marinara sauce you want to flip to that page in the catalog. Its an affectation but with a little regional magic.Anderson is 43 now and theres a new comfort with himself here. So much of this movie is catalog- or coffee-table ready but thats OK. Thats not all it is. When Sam exits an elaborately produced school pageant he does so in a series of shots that features scores of kids in animal costumes standing around. Its just a director showing off - with Anderson you always wish you had an extra set of eyes. Its also just handsome.Anderson knows hes among the best composers of the camera frame the movies have ever had and hes having fun with that. The Rockwell allusions with all the scouting scenes actually leave their reference points and stake out new territory and thats whats exciting. Anderson no longer appears content solely with allusions. He knows they have to count for something since a lot of people wont know what hes referring to anyway. So when Norton and the troops in their uniforms lift the flap to Sams empty tent you might think about Rockwell but the image - a medium close-up of them from a low angle - is so funny that it works on it own.Anderson has suffused the movie with the kind of square hipness he likes. The difference in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is that Sam for instance has never heard Suzys Francoise Hardy records. Anderson discovers the blissful powers of discovery. Elsewhere Alexandre Desplat shares music duties with Benjamin Britten operas and fugues some as explained by a child. Its harmonious pairing. Desplats tom-toms and furiously plucked strings are interwoven with the children cooing in Brittens operas. They make haunting aural needlepoint.Its important I think that the movies set on an island. Its apart from Andersons other films even as its a total self-embrace too. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" has a new depth for him. The story builds emotionally and visually. Theres a mounting atmosphere his movies tend to lack - sometimes you dont know what in the end he was going for. This time its clear Anderson is headed toward a resolution of some kind and the suspense comes from whether hell get there (he does).The film climaxes once on the scout campgrounds where a beautifully orchestrated couple of sequences introduce Jason Schwartzman in scouting khakis. It does so again a few scenes later with all the characters converged in a church where there are displays of human (physical) darkness and suspense all under the cloak of clever comedy. I didnt leap from my chair at the end of ""Moonrise Kingdom."" But emotionally Im heavier than I was in 1998. So is Anderson I suspect. The delight hasnt lessened so much as deepened Yes yes yes.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Moonrise Kingdom Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Moonrise Kingdom Wes Anderson meticulously crafts a world of yearning  1/2 Moonrise Kingdom Edward Norton stars in ""Moonrise Kingdom."" Edward Norton stars in ""Moonrise Kingdom."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Nothing in a Wes Anderson movie is quite like life. He creates odd gorgeous miniature universes on screen setting his characters in italics so that they become characters playing themselves in a pageant inspired by their own lives.The storybook quality to his films is either coy or entrancing depending on your receptiveness to Andersons comic spark and his sharply angled presentational arrangements of actors against some of the most rigorous design youll find in a contemporary American filmmaker. Within that strange formalism though -- and this is what saves his best work from preciousness -- lies some wonderfully rich comedy as well as a sweet-and-sour sincerity familiar to anyone whos seen Andersons masterwork ""Rushmore"" or his most recent picture the animated ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" That last picture took me a re-viewing to figure out in terms of tone and to fully enjoy and for other people the same may be true of Andersons latest the sweetly yearning""Moonrise Kingdom.""Its a fable about what it feels like to be 12 years old and afflicted from head to toe by a romantic crush the size of a planet.The film takes place on the (fictional) island of New Penzance somewhere off the coast of Rhode Island. Our narrator and resident historian is played by Bob Balaban who pops in and out of ""Moonrise Kingdom"" as were taken back to Andersons fantasy edition of 1965 a time of transistor radios and Tang but with no indication of whats happening in the real world (Vietnam for instance) off the island. Young Sam played by newcomer Jared Gilman is an orphan who has bounced from foster home to foster home and now finds himself uneasily in a new situation summer camp with the Khaki Scouts of North America. His troop leader played by a droll Edward Norton with a cig in hand throughout is completely on the ball in some ways and completely clueless in others. When Sam runs away with Suzy (Kara Hayward) Nortons character must mobilize the troops in pursuit.Frances McDormand plays Suzys mother a taskmaster who never seems to relax and whos having an affair with the one and only local policeman played by a tight-lipped and forlorn Bruce Willis. Bill Murray who (thank heavens) has been in every Anderson film since ""Rushmore"" plays the father a retreater by nature which makes it all the more satisfying when he chucks one of his shoes at Willis head as they argue about how to locate the missing children.The movie includes what might be termed action sequences a digitally enhanced hurricane and flood intercut with scenes from a Noahs Ark pageant a rooftop rescue that sort of thing. Im not sure how much facility Anderson has for that sort of thing. Also while the kids (particularly Hayward) are effective playing cusp-adolescents taking a poetic leap into cusp-adulthood that deadpan Anderson style occasionally comes at the expense (its deliberate I think) of simple directly expressed emotion. The second time through""Fantastic Mr. Fox""I appreciated how seriously the film took the father/son issues and misunderstood-offspring angst at the center. Which is to say just seriously enough. At times in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" I had an itch for more.And yet there is so much to appreciate. First-time Anderson performers such as Willis McDormand and especially Norton fold effortlessly into the melancholy end-of-summer vibe. The script which Anderson wrote with Roman Coppola is a fanciful dream of a community finding itself and a boy and a girl finding out all is not lost just because the first 12 years havent been terrific. We make our own maps to the future and even though New Penzance isnt real Andersons realization thereof makes this seductive illusion stick.mjphillipstribune.comMoonrise Kingdom -- 3 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual content and smoking)Running time 134Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Animation (Movie Genre) Entertainment Literature Movies Moonrise Kingdom Arts and Culture Bill Murray 10 movies to see this summer Notable Cannes Film Festival winners Snow White at it again with fewer laughs more gore  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0529-moonrise-kingdom-20120531,0,2301743.column",200,moonrisekingdom14,moonrisekingdom,chicagotribune

Preceded by bewildering blogs and Tweets (and even a few genuine reviews) from Cannes (""A Tender Triumph"" ""Glows in the Darkness"" ""Ode to Arrested Development"") Wes Andersons Moonrise Kingdom is juvenile gibberish about two 12-year-olds who get married in a Boy Scout camp that is too sexually outrageous for the preteen age group it portrays and too tween for grown-ups. Like all Wes Anderson movies it is naive mannered pretentious and incomprehensible. He co-wrote it with Roman Coppola (yikes another Coppola). Together they were responsible for The Darjeeling Limited one of the worst movies of all time. This one is neither as contrived as The Royal Tenenbaums nor as moronic as The Darjeeling Limited but its boredom quotient is still stuck in the same unbroken wave of dubious tedium Mr. Anderson is famous for. (It also features another Coppola the creepy Jason Schwartzman.) What is it with this guy and his awful movies masquerading as ""original ideas"" that turns otherwise sensible critics into slobbering groupies? Set in 1965 at the dawn of the alleged sexual revolution this frivolous wafer-thin fable takes place on an island called Penzance with Gilbert and Sullivan overtones off the coast of New England populated by troops of misfits called ""Khaki Scouts"" (fearing I presume that after one look at the script the actual Boy Scouts of America might sue) run by idiotic scoutmasters (Edward Norton in his most embarrassing role since the ghastly Incredible Hulk and Harvey Keitel for whom overacting is a way of life). The lovers are Sam Shakusky and Suzy Bishop (newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) two kids who run away into the wilderness in a stolen canoe to eat jerky and play Francoise Hardy records. Well its the 1960s. I guess anything is possible. Anyway Sam is an unpopular bespectacled nearsighted orphan who is hated by the rest of the scouts so nobody is looking for him. But Suzys parents are lawyers who as played by Frances McDormand and Bill Murray talk to each other on megaphones and demonstrate immediately and at all times the root cause of their childs endless problems. Suzy drags along her little brothers portable phonograph two heavy suitcases filled with books and cat food spies on everyone and everything with a pair of binoculars hanging from her neck and invites Sam to feel her breasts after skinny dipping. Together they pitch a tent on the Old Chickshaw Harvest Migration Trail. Soon they are set upon by the gnat-brained island sheriff (Bruce Willis) and the entire nine-member Khaki Scout Troop 55 from Camp Ivanhoe all of whom fire deadly arrows and kill their pet doggie mascot by mistake. There is also a demented hag in a flaming orange wig from social services (Tilda Swinton naturally) who wants to ship Sam off to a foster home (or worse). Before it all ends--not a moment too soon if you ask me--prissy scoutmaster Ed Norton loses his pest control spray his latrine-inspection detail and his short pants while the runaway children land in another camp where the mentally challenged Jason Schwartzman enters. But wait. Its not over yet. The insanity culminates in yet another outrageous visual. The only thing worth mentioning about Moonrise Kingdom is the sound and art design. The sets and camerawork resemble colorful illustrations from childrens books and crayola drawings from a kindergarten art class. A red gingerbread house with ocean views abates a lighthouse that would be proud to appear in a Bette Davis movie. A field of Indian grass wafts its way in the breeze all the way to the sea. The soundtrack blares Benjamin Brittens ""Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra Op. 34 Fugue Allegro Motto"" Mozarts ""Cosi Fan Tutti"" Saint-Saens ""Carnival of the Animals"" and ""Honky Tonkin"" by Hank Williams. What any of this overdose of whimsy actually means is anybodys guess. Pity the kid who wanders in by mistake thinking this is a movie for children. In all of his eccentric films instead of structuring his adolescent fantasies into one coherent narrative Mr. Anderson throws together lunatic fragments of surrealism that consist mainly of actors making fools of themselves. The result in the case of Moonrise Kingdom is what I call transcendentally brainless--an after school special aimed at asinine adolescents over the age of 40. rreedobserver.com MOONRISE KINGDOM Running Time 94 minutes Written by Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola Directed by Wes Anderson Starring Jared Gilman Kara Hayward and Bruce Willis 1/4 Comment Filed under Bruce Willis Jared Gilman Jason Shwartzman Kara Hayward movie Roman Coppola Wes Anderson Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2012/05/moonrise-kingdom-rex-reed-wes-anderson/,200,moonrisekingdom15,moonrisekingdom,com/2012/05/moonrise-kingdom-rex-reed-wes-anderson/

It takes place in 1965 on a fictional island called New Penzance where a 12-year-old orphan runs away from scout camp with a morose girl he considers his soul mate. A group of adults--the girls parents (Bill Murray Frances McDormand) the boys scout master (Edward Norton) a local sheriff (Bruce Willis)--organize a search and in the process coalesce into a little family of lonely depressives. As usual Andersons densely imagined mise-en-scene contains many allusions to movies music and literature (Benjamin Brittens orchestral work being a key touchstone); whats different this time is that most of the cultural references grow naturally from the characterization.

Warm witty and whimsical it is a fabulous fable a storybook tale of young love the innocence of youth and the disappointments of life.In his previous films Anderson has always done a high wire balancing act between humanism and whimsy bordering on the twee. Sometimes -- ""Rushmore"" the marvelous ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" -- it works. Sometimes -- ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" -- it doesnt resulting in movies that come off as self-consciously quirky and overly clever.But with ""Moonrise Kingdom"" Anderson is on very sure footing not only finding the right balance but also the greatest measure of heart and sincerity he has achieved in his live action films (2009s ""Mr. Fox"" was animated).The film is set on Penzance a remote island off the coast of New England that seems to occupy a space somewhere between Prosperos island in ""The Tempest"" and Neverland. It is the late summer of 1965 and as the films helpful narrator (an elfin Bob Balaban in a delightful droll performance) is quick to tell us the island will soon be struck by the worst storm in its history.Advertisement Among those on the island two 12-year-old loners who (by adult criteria) are ""troubled kids."" Suzy (Kara Hayward) the eldest child of married lawyers (Bill Murray Frances McDormand) who ignore her and each other rightfully feels neglected and spends most of her time engrossed in fantasy adventure novels. Sam (Jared Gilman) an orphan who is about to be disowned by his foster parents is stuck at a scouting camp -- run by the well-meaning but ineffectual Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton) -- a place where he doesnt have a single friend.The two had met the previous summer during of all things a performance of Benjamin Brittens opera ""Noyes Fludde"" (basically the story of Noahs ark so weve got a real flood-storm theme going on). With just a few words and glances the precocious kids realize they are soul mates who must be together. So for a full year they plot and conspire to run away together and escape a world where they are misunderstood and very much alone.Their disappearance causes great consternation among the adults on the island mostly because of the inconvenience. Only the scout master and the islands police chief the rather sad Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) seem particularly concerned about the kids safety and the search for Sam and Suzy is more a chase than a rescue effort.The young couple does eventually find their own little slice of paradise -- an isolated cove that they rename Moonrise Kingdom. And for at least a day they make a life on the beach with all the enchantment that comes with first kisses (a funny but truly poignant scene) and living on their own terms.Eventually Sam and Suzy are found (well caught) and it looks like Sam is headed to orphanage (or possibly shock therapy). But as the storm closes in they escape again this time with the help of Sams scout troop who see the errors of their ways and end playing the Lost Boys to Sams Peter and Suzys Wendy and a slightly sleazy scout leader (Anderson regular Jason Schwartzman).In the end love wins out and there is even a measure of redemption for some of the adults.Throughout ""Moonrise Kingdom"" Anderson brings richness of detail (a terrific production design by Adam Stockhausen) beautifully conceived cinematography from Robert Yeoman impeccable musical choices and a smart crisp dialogue (co-written by frequent collaborator Roman Coppola) that avoids both mushiness and the excessively quirky. He also draws impeccable performances from Murray McDormand Norton Tilda Swinton as an icy Social Services bureaucrat and Willis who does a particularly sensitive turn as the lonely Captain Sharp.Then there are the kid actors. Hayward and Gilman are newcomers who are asked to carry much of the film and pull it off with lovely understatement and extraordinary believability. When they look at each other you fully believe that Sam and Suzy dont just think theyre in love they really are in love and deserve a magical world all their own.In the end who knows if they live happily ever after? But youll leave ""Moonrise Kingdom"" hoping they do.moonrise kingdom    1/2Opens San Francisco on June 1; elsewhere in the Bay Area on June 8Rating PG-13 (for mild sexual content and smoking)Cast Bruce Willis Edward Norton Bill Murray and Frances McDormandDirector Wes AndersonRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

GREECE Greece could exit Euro Zone MALI Amnesty reports the worst human rights crisis in years My Cannes 2012 experience got off to a kind start yesterday. When I found myself cash-less and red-faced at a sandwich stand the petite blonde-haired woman behind the counter cheerfully chirped ""Pay me tomorrow its no problem"" Then as she handed me my lunch with a smile ""This wouldnt happen in Paris."" True enough. Similar sweetness and good humor was on display at this mornings screening of the festivals opening film Wes Andersons Moonrise Kingdom a lovely--if feather-light--ode to young love and growing up. Moonlight Kingdom (out May 25 in the U.S.) is not as enchanting an opener as Woody Allens Midnight in Paris last year but its moments of transporting beauty and visual brilliance overcame my growing aversion to Wes Andersons brand of ultra-stylized archness. That aversion had me rolling my eyes in the films first minutes as Andersons camera pans across and tracks up and down the interior of a familys New England home pausing to show us the inhabitants in the meticulously symmetrical fussily choreographed accessorized and color-coded shots that are the directors trademark. Ive long felt that despite his technical skill Andersons dollhouse aesthetic--as distinctive and personal as it may be--has mostly stifled any ounce of spontaneity or genuine emotion in his movies. The filmmakers jokes have been more ""funny"" than funny his picture-frame-ready images are art-directed to within an inch of their lives and his sensibility has often felt like an aging-hipster pose. Early scenes in Moonrise Kingdom are a perfect illustration of that tendency as various adults--Edward Norton as a wholesome camp counsellor Bill Murray and Frances McDormand as anxious parents Bruce Willis as a dim cop--dart around in a panic after a 12-year-old boy and girl run away together. The comic-book gags (McDormand using a loudspeaker to call her kids to dinner Norton performing an inspection of his campers sleeping quarters) and deadpan dialogue arent particularly witty and the cast is too busy winking at the camera for us to ease into the story. Its moments of transporting beauty and visual brilliance overcame my growing aversion to Wes Andersons ultra-stylized archness. But once Anderson zeroes in on his two young protagonists a bespectacled oddball named Sam (Jared Gilman) and a sullen gangly beauty named Suzy (Kara Hayward) the film settles in to a pleasing groove. A montage of the two of them in the woods testing out their survival skills (sucking on rocks to hydrate catching and frying up fish) is charming and the interlude in which they camp out on an abandoned beach--their private paradise complete with softly lapping waves and a pink sunset--casts a gentle poetic spell. Anderson and his young actors pull off one moment I was ready to hate in which the two dance awkwardly to a Francoise Hardy song (a sort of pre-pubescent version of the famous John Travolta-Uma Thurman dance-off from Pulp Fiction). He also stages a surprisingly frisky first kiss making a moment weve seen countless times before feel fresh. Meanwhile the director composes some strikingly original images as when Sam pierces Suzys ears with fish hooks adorning her with hand-crafted insect earrings as a fine stream of blood trickles down her neck (a mutual deflowering by proxy). The irony of the adult characters behaving like children (when Tilda Swinton turns up as an uptight social worker I almost groaned out loud) while the children pursue their plan with grown-up solemnity wears thin. But the stubborn low-intensity bond between the two young adolescents--passions in Wes Anderson films run cool--is both amusing and touching. The director may treat Sams and Suzys love with mock gravity but theres real feeling in the way he shows them embracing each others eccentricities Sam has Suzy read aloud to him from her favorite fantasy novels while she gingerly removes the pipe from his mouth when he falls asleep. Even the irritating adult characters deepen as the story progresses with the kids escape generating currents of longing and regret in the characters played by Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand. An overly busy finale threatens to bog the movie down in too much action but Anderson recovers with a gorgeous coda that captures the sense of loss that has always been at the heart of his work--happy endings and all. Hes still a filmmaker teetering dangerously on the brink of terminal tweeness but Sam and Suzy bring out Andersons sincere side. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is about romantic love but its also about love of books music nature and objects--in many regards a movie that allows Anderson to be himself in a way most of his recent efforts havent. It may fade from memory as the festival proceeds but for now at least ""Moonrise Kingdom"" has me reconsidering a filmmaker I had started to write off.

Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

By Anthony Lane In Wes Andersons new movie true and untrue fuse together like twins.   Credit Illustration by Adrian Tomine The new Wes Anderson film ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is set in 1965 off the coast of New England on the island of New Penzance. The time is real but the location is not although its geography and its cartography are fixed with care. Such is Andersons way for every note of provable precision a more fanciful detail flutters past. You can be sure for instance that the make and the model of the portable record-player that we see at the start playing Benjamin Brittens ""The Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra"" will be wholly authentic whereas the royal-blue pants suit and matching bonnet--a sort of Damnation Army uniform--that are sported by an older person a queenly beast of authority identified only as Social Services (Tilda Swinton) have clearly been constructed for the fun of the film. Both style items have their place; true and untrue fuse together like twins. Twelve-year-old Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) lives on a tip of the island with her parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand). They are both lawyers who call each other Counsellor and sleep in separate beds with a table in between. As they lie there Mrs. Bishop tells Mr. Bishop not to feel so sorry for himself. ""Why?"" he replies staring up into the dark with two black eyes. (He apparently fell into a ditch but you do wonder.) As for Mrs. Bishops affair with the local police officer Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) it has a damp and listless air. So where does eagerness shine on this disenchanted isle? Why at Camp Ivanhoe where Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton) resplendent in shorts and long thick socks oversees his charges. Nothing could be more orderly than their row of tents or brisker than their breakfast routine. One day however a Scout is gone. ""Jiminy Cricket hes flown the coop"" Ward exclaims. The truant is young Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and he has gone to find Suzy. They met the year before at a performance of Brittens ""Noyes Fludde""; we are shown that encounter in one of Andersons beautifully rounded flashbacks. (I sometimes feel that he would have relished a slot among the Hollywood pioneers reeling off gag-infested films of less than twenty minutes.) Since then they have been pen pals and now they come face to face once more--Sam with his canoe gun tent and all-around scouting skills Suzy with her library books and a cat in a basket. His most urgent concern obviously is the books ""Some of these are going to be overdue"" he says. Larger anxieties like their status as underage runaways in love with the authorities on their trail are barely mentioned. This is Andersonland where deadpan is the default. Sams parents are no longer alive and his foster parents dont want him; he is an island unto himself. ""I always wished I was an orphan"" Suzy says voicing the weird desire that rings through fictional childhoods. Think of the Radlett children in Nancy Mitfords ""The Pursuit of Love"" who when their mother and father took an ocean voyage ""would rush for the newspapers every day hoping to see that their parents ship had gone down with all aboard."" Childrens most engulfing fear can be the sharpest spur to their imaginations. Fatherlessness such a nightmare for the Little Princess is a springboard for Pippi Longstocking and in ""James and the Giant Peach"" by Roald Dahl (whose ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" became an Anderson film in 2009) the heros parents are eaten by a rhino on the first page. To be bereft is also to be free--free among other things to embrace an ersatz family if your actual one goes missing or repeatedly lets you down. Hence all the mini-societies in Anderson films the activity-packed school in ""Rushmore""; the undersea crew in ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou""; and now the Scouts in ""Moonrise Kingdom."" When Suzy and Sam hook up with the troop later in the movie she reads aloud to them at night like Wendy mothering the Lost Boys. Here I think is the power source for the motions of Andersons camera. He is often spoken of as an arch-geometrician drawn to cinema by the orders of symmetry that it allows him to impose. However when I watch those graceful sideways tracking shots of his--through the Bishop residence at the start of the new film or along the train carriages at the end of ""The Darjeeling Limited""--what I sense is not a technical tic but a pressing need to bind people together even as they threaten to pull apart. (Andersons parents we may note in passing divorced when he was eight.) Certain makers of musicals like Stanley Donen and Vincente Minnelli were feted or decried for their organizational verve and a fetishistic appetite for color; only with time did it emerge that what they sought was a shape for emotional longings and that could happen here too. Who knows we may look back on Andersons works as we do on the boxes of Joseph Cornell--formal troves of frippery studded with nostalgic private jokes that lodge inexplicably in the heart. In ""Moonrise Kingdom"" that lodging is already under way. You see it when Sam pierces the ear of his paramour with a fishhook dangling a green beetle on the end to make an earring; when a tear gathers in her eye in pearly closeup smearing her mascara; when he kisses her then spits politely explaining ""I got sand in my mouth""; and when in the middle of a forest he lays out not a scrappy picnic but a table setting for two with hot dogs on plates and a final flourish of mustard. At moments like these it is the kids who conduct themselves like preemptive grownups. The adults meanwhile orphaned of passion and drained of all chivalry and logic slump back into childish ways. Andersons great gift is to catch the generations as they intersect. (Not for the first time remember Gene Hackman catching a gleeful ride on the flank of a garbage truck with his grandsons in ""The Royal Tenenbaums."") The subtlest sequence comes as the police chief who lives alone in a trailer cooks supper for Sam. He pours the boy a beer adding ""Youre probably a much more intelligent person than I am."" Willis is movingly modest here an action star relaxing with relief into an inaction role. Thanks to him ""Moonrise Kingdom"" so often chipper is left with a tint of comic bruising. He is aided in this cause by Murray who is not just Andersons lucky charm having worked on almost all his films but the most singular presence in American cinema. Who else carries the burden of our bafflement with such aplomb forever surprising a hunger in himself to be more serious or as occasion demands more nuts? I still dont know whether to laugh cry or call 911 at the sight of Mr. Bishop naked from the waist up bearing an axe and a bottle of wine ambling past his three young sons Suzys dutiful siblings and announcing ""Ill be out back. Im going to find a tree to chop down."" Far behind that line you hear a despairing echo of the old George Washington myth as if Murrays character were saying ""Children I cannot tell a lie. Im dead wood."" ""Moonrise Kingdom"" could only be an Anderson project. We know as much from the butter-pat yellow that spreads from the italic lettering of the opening credits to telephones suitcases and elsewhere. Then there is the scattering of dry slapstick a homemade rocket is launched in the background while somebody makes an important speech and then lands with a fizzling thud behind him completely unremarked. But the new film also flies further than its predecessors being less self-enclosed than hitherto and more inclined to seek the open air. Where ""Rushmore"" climaxed with a school production--a show inside a show--Sam and Suzy confront their fate in a tempest. This has brewed throughout the movie ever since our onscreen narrator (the wry Bob Balaban in a knit hat) warned us of its coming in the first minutes. (Typically Mr. Bishop hopes that it will rip the roof off his house and whirl him away.) Here we now realize was one reason for Andersons choice of ""Noyes Fludde""--the miracle play set to Brittens music always performed by children and first heard in 1958 on a patch of the English coast which had been half-drowned by a maddened sea five years before just as New Penzance is now in danger of being washed away. And so the whole orchestra of characters joins together fortissimo as the flood arrives to save our heroes in both body and soul. Viewers who remain immune to Anderson will find something toylike and irritating even in this cliffhanger with its artful choreography of chaos. I prefer to think of the wildness still to come as the flirtatious escapades of youth turn to sex and other riptides--all the havoc of maturity that has left the oldsters in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" so foolishly beached. With that in mind who better than Wes Anderson to keep a calm eye on the storm?  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Take our movie trivia quiz Monitor Movie Guide Wes Andersons ""Moonrise Kingdom"" which opened this years Cannes Film Festival has all of his trademark manic mannerisms the color-coordinated visuals and mega-attention to detail; the arch hyperclever dialogue; the performances that seem borderline cartoonish.But it also has a sweetness that some of his other films (like ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" and ""The Darjeeling Limited"") lack.Set in 1965 its about a mini-romance between two 12-year-old renegades Suzy (Kara Hayward) who lives with her family in a lighthouse on a New England island and the orphan Sam (Jared Gilman) who deserts his Khaki Scout troop to abscond with her. Sam is very bright and very nerdy and he knows his way around the wilderness; Suzy who likes French pop tunes and heavy eye shadow is game but clueless - she totes along her battery-powered record player and pet kitten. Recommended Think youre a film buff? Take our movie trivia quiz Various outsize adults join in the rescue mission including a hapless troop leader (Edward Norton) Suzys off-kilter parents (Frances McDormand and Bill Murray) the town sheriff (Bruce Willis) and a Cruella de Vil-ish social services director (Tilda Swinton). Anderson keeps this whirligig in constant motion and because the Suzy-Sam duet is so awkwardly tender the film doesnt wear out its welcome. It makes you nostalgic for the pangs of young love.

"Moonrise Kingdom review Welcome to Wes Anderson World |       NJ.com comments Moonrise Kingdom review Welcome to Wes Anderson World Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 25 2012 at 554 AM View/Post Comments (FOCUS)Edward Norton is a worried camp leader in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" A true auteurs movie leaves you feeling it only could have been made by one person. Wes Andersons movies leave you feeling they were made by hand by one person. Its not just Andersons fondness for shooting on film avoiding modern music and eschewing computer-generated effects (his new film ""Moonrise Kingdom"" even uses miniatures for some shots). Its that the films themselves - ""Rushmore"" ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" among them - feel that carefully painstakingly crafted. Compared to ever-bigger blander Hollywood offerings they seem practically artisanal. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is the small story of a pair of tweens who fall in love one summer in rural 1965 New England and decide to run away just as a hurricane starts barreling down; their disappearance will bring out the whole town in a frantic search. Thats the basic plot. But what makes it an Anderson movie are the things he adds which mark all his films - the pop-cultural obsessions and excruciatingly detailed set decorations overarching thematic concerns and little stylistic tics. Once again this is a movie about distant parents and disaffected children. Once again there are also a few half-buried nods to ""Peanuts"" a major Anderson touchstone; Sam and Suzy the wayward 12-year-olds could very easily be an only slightly older Charlie Brown and Little Red-Haired Girl. (""Rats"" Sam even exclaims at one point.) Yet what ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is really about - what all Anderson films are about on some level - is a lonely kind of remove. Many directors have a signature shot and for Anderson its always been a slow lateral tracking movement revealing the life going on inside disparate little boxes within a grand space - the train in ""The Darjeeling Limited"" the ship in ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" the mansion in ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" It occurs again here moving across the rooms of Suzys house and revealing the various family members in their separate cells. But like the best camera style it not only comes from content but helps create it; its a visual way of showing how separate these people are from each other how they compartmentalize everything and everyone. Thats been a bit of the criticism of Anderson too; that he stands outside all his characters in a too-tight bespoke suit observing them with wry amusement. If hes smiling though its from compassion not superiority; there is always real feeling in these films however carefully the sorrow is held in check. In fact deadpan despair is often the mood of Andersons movies - and Bill Murray a constant mournful presence best sets that tone here as Suzys father. But there are other good performances including Bruce Willis as a small-town cop and Edward Norton as a boys-camp counselor whose humorless efficiency cant quite hide his basic decency. Particularly fine are Kara Hayward and South Oranges Jared Gilman as the 12-year-olds in love. Theyre the ones who set all this chaos in motion but how can you blame them? After all they protest their love is real; it will last forever; nothing not a thing will ever change it or them. But Anderson knows thats not true. And once Suzy and Sammy learn that too theyll be able to return as full-fledged adults in his movies - well brought up nicely tailored people leading their single solitary lives in their tiny well-appointed boxes oblivious to the intimate stranger just next door. Ratings note The film contains violence and alcohol abuse. Moonrise Kingdom (PG-13) Focus (94 min.) Directed by Wes Anderson. With Edward Norton Bill Murray Bruce Willis. Now playing in New York.

Photo Focus Features/courtesy Everett Edward Norton (front center) in ""Moonrise Kingdom."" ((c)Focus Features/courtesy Everett) Disarmingly sweet Wes Andersons ""Moonrise Kingdom at its most appealing focuses on a tween Romeo and Juliet who take flight from their guardians on a small fictional island off the coast of New England during the summer of 1965. Played by a couple of gifted and very natural newcomers 12-year-olds Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) are a pair of misfit pen pals who met during a performance of Benjamin Brittens ""Noyes Fludde (""Noahs Flood"") at the local church a year earlier. Like everything else in Andersons film that piece of music has been carefully selected -- weve already been told by the on-screen narrator (Bob Balaban) that a historic hurricane will hit the island of New Penzance and he certainly seems to be dressed for it. Sam a geeky nearsighted orphan and budding artist who lives in an unhappy foster home on the mainland is on the run from a scout camp on New Penzance presided over by vaguely irresponsible scoutmaster Edward Norton. Suzy -- like your typical 12-year-old girl more physically and emotionally mature than Sam -- is a troubled beauty and devout reader of adventure fiction on the run from her bickering lawyer parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and three annoying kid brothers. By the time the islands nominal adults -- including the laid-back police chief (Bruce Willis) whos having an affair with Suzys mother -- realize theyre gone the kids have set up camp on the shore of a tidal inlet they rename Moonrise Kingdom. These are the most magical moments as they dance to her French records frolic in the surf and begin exploring their pre-adolescent yearnings (Sams gingerly piercing Suzys ears with fishing hooks is a suggestively neat touch). Resourceful Suzy and Sam draw a bit of blood as they hold off an attempt by scouts who have joined the search party to bring them back. Eventually though the sheriff brings them in -- though he has reservations about turning Sam over to the fierce woman known only as ""Social Services (Tilda Swinton) who plans to put the youngster in an orphanage where he may be subjected to electroshock therapy. The kids escape again and flee by boat to a scout ""hootenanny on a neighboring island where they are ""married by a chaplain (Jason Schwartzman) much to the annoyance of the scout commander (Harvey Keitel who basically functions as a sight gag). By this point the hurricane is finally arriving and the script by Anderson and his frequent collaborator Roman Coppola gets overly hectic though never actually realistic. When a character is struck by lightning he suffers nothing worse than a coat of charcoal like a character in a 1940s cartoon. In fact the previous Anderson movie this most resembles is the animated ""Fantastic Mr. Fox. While the new film is nowhere near as good as his masterpiece ""The Royal Tenenbaums its whimsy is less forced than ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou and ""The Darjeeling Limited. ""Moonrise Kingdom isnt going to make converts of those who resist Andersons strenuously curatorial style where the cameras primary function is often to linger over the clothing furnishing and props hes so lovingly selected. At his worst its entirely fair and accurate to describe Andersons work as twee. But I liked this one because of its young performers the evocative island setting (filmed in Rhode Island) Alexandre Desplats lovely score and Robert Yeomans slightly grainy cinematography. Oh and Edward Nortons miniature reel-to-reel tape recorder which rates close-ups in two separate scenes. Quite a few other period details have been made up by Anderson who was born in 1969. But I had a reel-to-reel just like that.

But as in both of those films it features Bill Murray in a key role.A lyrical blend of wit whimsy and woe is Andersons trademark and Moonrise Kingdom is no exception. With its focus on a pair of 12-year-olds the film has the quality of an offbeat fairy tale that is both meticulously detailed and dreamlike.STORY Young stars of Moonrise Kingdom are standoutsMORE Wes Anderson discusses the rookie stars of KingdomVIDEO Cast talks Moonrise at Cannes Film FestivalOther Anderson films including Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited have focused on disaffected adults but the lens here is trained on adolescent angst and the headiness of first love.Suzy (Kara Hayward) is a sad-faced girl with painted blue eyelids saddle shoes and a penchant for looking at the world through binoculars.

Bruce Willis is wonderfully low-key as the towns lonely well-meaning sheriff. Tilda Swinton has a small part as an officious bureaucrat (who identifies herself only as ""Social Services""). Bob Balaban is an elfin narrator.Suzy and Sam trudge off into the woods and set up camp with an endearing blend of moxie and defiance. Their interactions are tenderly funny. Adult cluelessness and the clash between children and those tasked to care for them are recurring Anderson themes.With this his seventh film Anderson -- who co-wrote the script with Roman Coppola-- makes only one misstep in a scene that involves a canine camp mascot.Otherwise his stylized tale comes off like an enchanting if idiosyncratic storybook fantasy with coming-of-age emotional depth.With music by composer Benjamin Britten offering a dramatic counterpoint Anderson weaves a sweetly compassionate tale of troubled kids and young love. Marked by a lovely wistful quality Moonrise Kingdom is an enchantingly droll song of innocence and experience. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

"Moonrise Kingdom directed by Wes Anderson reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Moonrise Kingdom A Gorgeously Shot Ingeniously Crafted Occasionally Irritating Wes Anderson Bonbon Moonrise Kingdom A Gorgeously Shot Ingeniously Crafted Occasionally Irritating Wes Anderson Bonbon Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 24 2012 723 PM Moonrise Kingdom A gorgeously shot ingeniously crafted occasionally irritating Wes Anderson bonbon. By Dana Stevens Moonrise Kingdom. Photo courtesy Focus Features. Also in Slate See our interview with Wes Anderson in which he explains his obsession with childhood fantasies and his love of pop music and head over to Brow Beat to play Wes Anderson Bingo. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Wes Anderson is one of those directors about whom one is supposed to stake a position. The binary breaks down something like this Is he an aggravatingly twee hyper-stylist or a uniquely gifted visually innovative auteur? Of course thats a formulation so reductive as to be nonsensical Anderson can be a little--sometimes a lot--of both at once. Of his films so far there are only two I unreservedly love Rushmore and Fantastic Mr. Fox and none I truly hate (OK maybe The Darjeeling Limited  which left me feeling bashed over the head by that symbolic Louis Vuitton luggage.) In the space of a single scene in an Anderson movie I can go from rolling my eyes to clapping in childish delight and back again. But hes definitely on the list of directors whose films I tend to await with real excitement--not just ""Hmmm wonder what hell do next?"" but ""Ooh this could be fun"" And Moonrise Kingdom (Focus Features) is fun a gorgeously shot ingeniously crafted uber-Andersonian bonbon that even in its most irritatingly whimsical moments remains an effective deliverer of cinematic pleasure. (Unless you really hate Wes Anderson in which case I bet it would be one of his funnest movies to mock.) A love story about two 12-year-olds who run away together this film returns to the territory where Anderson for better or for worse seems most creatively at home the threshold between late childhood and early adulthood with all its ineffable longings and peculiar manias. Advertisement The preteen hero and heroine Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) fall in love inexplicably deeply and at first sight in the summer of 1964 Shes dressed as a raven for her part in a church pageant about Noahs Ark hes attending the show with his Khaki Scout troop. The following summer on the exquisite fictional island of New Penzance (where he goes to camp and she lives year-round) Sam escapes from his tent and meets up with Suzy for a meticulously planned romantic idyll--they pitch a hand-decorated tent on the beach catch fish and read each other stories even experiment with some stiffly chaste French kissing. All the while Suzys parents (Frances McDormand and Bill Murray) Sams camp counselor (Ed Norton) and the islands lone policeman (Bruce Willis) scour the island for the missing children with the remaining Khaki Scouts assisting in the search. Ingeniously constructed and paced Moonrise Kingdom leaps between this chase story and a series of short lyrical flashbacks including an impressively efficient epistolary montage. These give us glimpses into Sams and Suzys unhappy home lives or in Sams case lack thereof. Hes an orphan bouncing between foster care and prisonlike group homes; shes a hot-tempered head case who finds a book on top of the refrigerator titled Coping With the Very Troubled Child. Other plots weave in and out of Sam and Suzys romance Suzys mother has been having an affair with the cop and her bitter depressed husband is on to them. Sams foster parents have decided to put him on the street after two years and an officious woman from Social Services (Tilda Swinton) is looking to haul him off to a sinister ""juvenile refuge."" These are some pretty dark things to have happen between your characters--betrayal abandonment the threat of imprisonment--but Anderson seems always to hold the chaos of negative emotion at arms length inviting pathos even as he deflects real investment. Hes a cool director not just in terms of aesthetic tastes (Can you imagine Wes Andersons music collection? And how organized it must be?) but of emotional temperature as well. Whether that emotional reserve comes off as stylish or stunted varies as I mentioned above from scene to scene and even within scenes. I never for example believed to the core in Sam and Suzys romance the passionate rightness of which is meant to power this whole story. Part of this may be that neither of these two perfectly likable young actors managed to consistently hit the right tone for the clipped obliquely funny dialogue by Anderson and Roman Coppola. To be fair its a challenging tone to hit ""Deadpan"" can be a micro-inflection away from ""expressionless."" Most of the adults here manage it though Ed Norton is both hilarious and touching as the dedicated but incompetent troop leader who conducts inspections with a martinets high standards and dictates a nightly ""Scoutmasters Log"" into a two-reel recorder. Willis and McDormand bring way more acting ammunition than is needed to their wispily underwritten romance. And Anderson stalwarts Murray and Jason Schwartzman own their roles as respectively a cuckold dad and a power-mad camp counselor but they remain on the periphery like wandering jesters. Even as it charmed me scene for scene I could never quite locate the source and direction of this films dramatic energy. But maybe its OK to find Moonrise Kingdom both dramatically inert and aesthetically entrancing to recommend it with a Wes Anderson asterisk (which would probably be a bright yellow asterisk lovingly embroidered on brown corduroy). I hope so because if loving this Texan-turned-Parisians cunning compositions and inspired use of music and staggeringly detailed production design is wrong I dont want to be right. Yes hes something of an obsessive hobbyist a creator of self-contained inaccessible ships in bottles (a creation metaphor that Anderson literalized in The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou). And yes I think it would be a good thing for him as an artist to break through the glass at some point and start sailing those ships on open waters. But the miniaturist details in this particular bottle--the flyleaf-style hand-drawn maps of New Penzance Island; the landscape shots as precise and delicate as watercolor paintings; the scratchily recorded childrens music of Benjamin Britten; the delightful presence of Bob Balaban as a narrator whos half Hal Holbrook in Our Town half Delphic oracle--are marvelous enough that Im willing to wait around and see what he builds next.

Video courtesy of The Weinstein Company. By Joe Morgenstern May 24 2012 613 p.m. ET To avoid misunderstanding a French film called ""Les Intouchables""--meaning of course ""The Untouchables""--comes to us with a hybrid title ""The Intouchables."" Its not quite English but neither does it evoke crime fighters in 1930s Chicago. This hugely likable comedy a box-office phenomenon in France takes place in contemporary Paris. Loosely based on a true story it finds unlikely uplift along with tenderness in a friendship between two men who are untouchables in different ways Philippe a wealthy white aristocrat left quadriplegic by a parasailing accident; and Driss a black ex-con from the projects who becomes Philippes caretaker. Theres still room for misunderstanding in the scripts manipulation of racial and cultural stereotypes--its very French on and below the glossy surface. Yet the film fulfills its feel-good promise as long as its seen as the fairy tale it was meant to be. ENLARGE Omar Sy as Driss and Francois Cluzet as Philippe in The Intouchables. The Weinstein Company A fairy tale thats also a perfect star vehicle for Omar Sy the French comedian comic writer and television personality who makes Driss an unstoppable life force. An immigrant from Senegal with a big smile a bigger heart and a tripwire temper the caretaker transforms--and is transformed by--his paralyzed employer. Philippe is played by Francois Cluzet a superb actor who given the scripts dynamics often serves as Mr. Sys straight man. Philippe is fascinating in his own right. Thered be no movie if he werent open to being transformed or sufficiently intrigued by Drisss volcanic personality to risk a give-and-take with someone alien to his world. Yet ""The Intouchables"" becomes Mr. Sys show just as last weeks French release ""Polisse"" was dominated by the French rapper Joeystarr. Its not that both men are nonwhite but that both by virtue of their training bring outsize energies to productions shrewdly tailored to their talents. Thus does Driss make a mockery of Philippes beloved high culture--opera classical music modern art--in a series of setups that are as shameless as they are entertaining. (The best moment may be the most shameless when Driss shakes up Philippes birthday party.) And culture isnt his only target. He cant fathom why Philippe would sustain an epistolary relationship with a woman hes never seen. Pick up the phone and call her Driss says forgetting that among other impediments to love a quadriplegic cant pick up anything. When Philippe insists that all he wants is a meeting of minds we understand what he does not that hes already got a great one with Driss. Agent J travels in time to MIBs early years in the 1960s to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history. Video courtesy of Sony. ""The Intouchables"" which was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano--and handsomely shot by Mathieu Vadepied--has a few odd lapses. The filmmakers are in such a hurry to get from one situation to the next that we never quite see the specific moment when Driss realizes that Philippe against all odds has actually hired him; or the moment when Driss realizes that Phillipe has sold a painting that the caretaker painted on a whim. And Driss can be a bit much when those outsize energies threaten to hurtle out of control. Mostly though the films appeal is so unerring that its easy to forget how offensive its characterizations might have seemed in other circumstances the white aesthete empowered by great wealth; the black servant jovial and companionable but still a man with a criminal past. (The real-life caretaker a Muslim named Abdel was born in Algeria.) How then does all of this qualify for fairy-tale status? For audiences in France and Western Europe the answer must have been simple given the productions remarkable commercial success--by using humanity and humor to defuse the anxieties of contemporary life. In the France of the film the nations ceaseless clash of cultures has a cheerful lilt immigration isnt a problem and theres no place for alarmist politicians like Marine Le Pen. For audiences here the social context matters little if at all but the pleasures are similar--mismatched buddies who prove to be perfectly matched happiness bought not with money but with friendship and audacity and a feel-good ending that must be felt to be believed. ENLARGE Josh Brolin in Men in Black 3. Columbia Pictures Men in Black 3 If time travel worked as well for us as it works for Will Smiths Agent J in ""Men in Black III"" we could go back to the summer of 1997 and be astonished anew by the wit and copious inventions of ""Men in Black"" the now-classic sci-fi extravaganza about alien invaders among us and the terrestrial agents who monitor their activity. Since thats not an option were left with our memories and cant help but weigh them against the memories-to-be of this latest sequel. (""MIB II"" is best and ever so easily forgotten.) ""MIB 3"" directed by Barry Sonnenfeld in excellent 3-D suffers from problems that afflict almost every time-travel plot; the script credited to Etan Cohen is all over the place not just temporally but dramatically. Still the film is packed with gorgeous effects and amusing creatures including Jemaine Clements Boris the Animal and Agent Js travels take him back to someone who makes the whole adventure truly memorable Josh Brolins Agent K as a startlingly pleasant younger man. Hes startling because the hallmark of Agent K as played until now by Tommy Lee Jones has been comical disagreeableness; K has seen it all has battled all of the life-forms a chaotic universe can concoct and is no longer amused. Mr. Jones is back as the older K in the current sequel and his presence reminds us of how deep the old cops dyspepsia runs. (It also reminds us of how predictable Mr. Jones has become in strumming that single note through all of his recent roles.) The younger mans personality is all the more startling for the skill and generosity with which Mr. Brolin creates a persuasively vital K while foreshadowing the grump to come. The script explains the change in elaborate detail but the performance defies explanation; its mysteriously marvelous. A pair of young lovers flee their New England town which causes a local search party to fan out and find them. Video courtesy of Focus Features. Moonrise Kingdom Wes Andersons beguiling and endearing ""Moonrise Kingdom"" set on a mythical island off the coast of New England in 1965 starts with kids in what appears to be an overgrown doll house listening to Benjamin Brittens ""The Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra."" Whats going on here? Is Mr. Anderson trying to imitate the storybook look and animation techniques of his previous feature ""Fantastic Mr. Fox""? Maybe yes on the look but his new film in radiant live-action is very much its own creation an adults guide to young love. (Kids may go for it too though theyre apt to mistake its sweet-spirited eccentricity for discomfiting silliness.) Eccentricity is putting it mildly. Adam Stockhausens production design and Robert D. Yeomans cinematography provide a tween toyland for the 12-year-olds at the center of the action. Jared Gilmans Sam and Kara Haywards Suzy are made for each other and they know it after meeting at a church pageant. Hes a precocious orphan with foster parents who consider him emotionally disturbed. Shes unhappy at home as well she might be with the parents fate has given her; theyre played by Bill Murray and Frances McDormand. ENLARGE Bill Murray Frances McDormand Edward Norton and Bruce Willis in Wes Andersons Moonrise Kingdom. Focus Features As in all of Mr. Andersons films the adult world does not come off well though Bruce Williss police chief stands as an exception in this one which the director wrote with Roman Coppola. The grown-ups are clueless about what to do when Sam and Suzy run away together and vanish into the wilderness while a monster storm gathers force. Whats clear to us wise old moviegoers however is that Sam in his ridiculous coonskin cap and Suzy with her luggage and binoculars are headed toward adolescence on a voyage of self-discovery and that they love each other intensely even though theyre not sure what comes next. Edward Norton is a cigarette-smoking Scoutmaster. Bob Balaban is the narrator earnestly reporting the progress of the storm as its tracked by the U.S. Department of Inclement Weather. DVD Focus ENLARGE The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007) Beyond quadriplegia is a mercifully rare condition called locked-in syndrome when one is fully conscious but unable to move or speak. No fate could be more frightening no premise for popular entertainment could be more improbable. Yet Julian Schnabels magnificent French-language film like its true-life subject transcends realitys prison with surreal buoyancy. The source material is a slender but celebrated memoir of the same name by Jean-Dominique Bauby who is played in radiant good health as well as the deep freeze of immobility by Mathieu Amalric. In either mode its an astonishing performance. Tell No One (2006) Guillaume Canets brilliant thriller stars Francois Cluzet as Alexandre Beck a pediatrician who has lost his beloved wife her mutilated body was found near the shore of a lake theyd been visiting since they were children. Eight years later he starts receiving cryptic emails suggesting shes still alive. From that point forward everything he thinks he knows about the circumstances of the crime and everything we think we know from a series of flashbacks dissolves in doubt or explodes into chases. The director and Philippe Lefebvre adapted the script from a novel by the American crime author Harlan Coben. Bottle Rocket (1996) Wes Andersons directorial debut which he wrote with Owen Wilson stars Mr. Wilson as Dignan a delusional master-criminal-in-training. (Almost every character that the actor has played since is Dignans spiritual descendant.) The film also stars Owens brother Luke Wilson. He plays Anthony who has recently been released from a mental hospital and who finds love though no common language with a motel maid. Fey and almost plotless ""Bottle Rocket"" sometimes seems blissed out on its own inconsequentiality. Still in an era of coldly impersonal filmmaking its a handmade heartfelt oddity with lovely moments of deadpan sweetness.

"Review Wes Anderson finds near perfect balance in Moonrise Kingdom - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Wes AndersonReview Wes Anderson finds near perfect balance in Moonrise KingdomThe writer-directors humanism and surrealism blend well in the fable starring young talents Kara Hawyard and Jared Gilman with Bill Murray Frances McDormand and Bruce Willis.May 25 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Newcomer Jared Gilman stars as Sam in ""Moonrise Kingdom."" (Focus Features )It seems fitting that ""Moonrise Kingdom""arguably Wes Andersons most grown-up film yet is a warm and funny fable about kids on the cusp.Here the writer-directors tendency toward the allegorical casts a magical spell with Anderson finding a near perfect balance between the humanism and the surreal that imprints all of his work a sometimes for the better (""The Royal Tenenbaums""""Fantastic Mr. Fox"") and sometimes not (""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou""). In this tale about growing up and falling in love it seems Anderson has found his true heart.The story takes place in 1965 when after a year of letters and longing a couple of 12-year-olds Suzy (Kara Hayward) and Sam (Jared Gilman) carry out their plan to run away together. Shes a lovely lonely girl a voracious reader of grand adventures. Hes a precocious Khaki Scout in a coonskin cap and horn rims.They are hitting that age when nothing in the world a from the family youve got to your own skin a seems to fit anymore. Before it is over they will carve out their own special place Moonrise Kingdom as they try to escape a world that tests them at every turn and tries to tear them apart.Despite all those trials the environment is pure Norman Rockwell painted by as many light moments as dark. The film unfolds in a wind-swept little populated swath of Rhode Island with rocky inlets and fields of long grass that evoke a more innocent time as does the emotion between the youngsters a kind of unsullied purity to their connection that feels lost to most kids these days. The films narrator played by a heavily bearded Bob Balaban turns up on the shore looking like a birder on an outing and helping create a sense that this is a land of fables. He lays out the facts of the situation a as the kids are heading out a storm of major proportions is heading in.That theme of storms floods the film starting with Sam and Suzys first encounter at a church production of Noahs Ark. Shes a raven hes in the audience. A few words and a few looks is all that it takes to make it clear that they are soul mates and that in Gilman and Hayward we have rare young talents who dont need words to communicate what theyre feeling.Anderson and co-writer Roman Coppola are dipping into everything from first love to the Peter Pan syndrome to some very adult problems that beset the grown-ups in Suzy and Sams life. The central ones are Suzys parents Mr. and Mrs. Bishop (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) Sams Scout master (Edward Norton) the local sheriff Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Social Services an icy Tilda Swinton so much a bureaucrat shes not even given a name. Its a top-notch ensemble but they primarily serve as supporting players always a step or two behind in understanding what Sam and Suzy are going through.Before the kids head into an uncertain future there is a glimpse of what they are leaving behind. Suzy spends her days reading her three younger brothers playing nearby. Theres usually a record on not rock n roll but ""The Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra"" with the narrator explaining how such disparate elements come together to make something amazing a metaphor for Suzys life. The musical choices with Randall Poster as music supervisor and original music by Alexandre Desplat are so inventive they become their own narrative force.Sams lot is more difficult. Hes an orphan who has bounced around the foster care system. In the school year hes bullied by the other boys in the house; this summer hes being tortured by the other Scouts at a wilderness camp not too far from Suzys house. Its run by Scout Master Ward a nervous chain-smoking well-meaning incompetent very well played by Norton. Willis gives one of his most sensitive turns in years as the dense but sweet Captain Sharp who becomes something of a father figure for Sam albeit one who shares his beer.The sets with Adam Stockhausen in charge of production design are a study in found objects perfectly placed. All that attention to detail that Anderson is known for is recorded in sweeping and often unbroken shots by cinematographer Robert Yeoman (""Bridesmaids"") who brings a kind of softness to ""Moonrise."" There are classic Anderson touches a the Scouts tents precisely spaced like ducks in a row or the tree house high on a pole no tree in sight.The heart of the film comes as Sam and Suzy build their Moonrise Kingdom on a rocky beach and the way small truths emerge as Suzy reads from her books or Sam keeps the campfire burning. Though there are countless small meaningful touches in nearly every scene everything about ""Moonrise"" is spare. The dialogue is exceedingly crisp often delivered in short bursts.It works especially well when the grown-ups are sorting out what to do with the youngsters at the various crises points along the way a difficult life-changing decisions in the offing. That spareness gives ""Moonrise"" an appealing briskness and pragmatism too that helps keep the many complicating factors from weighing things down. It is just one of the many ways in which Anderson keeps the films emotions in check ensuring this very heartfelt film never gets anywhere near mush.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORE AWARDS COVERAGE PHOTOS Celebrity portraits by The Times OSCARS Inside the Academy TIMELINE Academy Awards through the years MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWes Anderson wrote Moonrise Kingdom with a little help...December 27 2012Wes Anderson talks Moonrise Kingdom Grand Budapest...October 31 2012Oscar 8-Ball Wes Andersons Moonrise KingdomAugust 29 2012Perspective Look beyond the facade in Wes Andersons filmsJuly 1 2012Wes Andersons Moonrise Kingdom breaks record at box...May 28 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTWes AndersonMoonrise KingdomCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-moonrise-kingdom-20120525,0,550797.story?track=rss",200,moonrisekingdom27,moonrisekingdom,latimes

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Moonrise Kingdom Andersons seventh feature is unlikely to convert those who believe the Texas-born filmmaker is merely a skilled miniaturist. If mannerism is all you see in Bottle Rocket Rushmore The Royal Tenenbaums The Life Aquatic The Darjeeling Limited and the animated Fantastic Mr. Fox go lap up the latest big-studio drool. To my mind Anderson is oxygen in a Hollywood choking from chasing its own greed-driven tail. Moonrise Kingdom shows a director growing in confidence and maturity. Take the remarkable scene set on a daylight beach in which Sam and Suzy first kiss - using tongues and groping awkwardly. Given the underage actors the moment could have been borderline kiddie porn. But Anderson handles it with a sensitivity and an unembarrassed openness that evoke the style of Francois Truffaut in classics such as The 400 Blows and Small Change. Anderson is also expert at using humor as a gateway to deeper feelings. When Suzy mentions love Sam is pleased but exasperated (""You dont know what youre talking about""). Newcomers Gilman and Hayward stay allergic to sweet and cute catching the exhilaration and cartwheeling confusion of being young and in thrall to each other. Adults soon intrude on their paradise. Theres a hurricane coming announces the films narrator (a delightful Bob Balaban). The scoutmaster (an engagingly wacked-out Edward Norton) organizes a search party with the help of his chief (Harvey Keitel) and cousin Ben a scam artist in scouts clothing played by a stellar Jason Schwartzman evoking his iconic role as Max Fischer in Rushmore. The police captain (a becomingly non-macho Bruce Willis) is also on the case pressured by Suzys mom with whom hes having an affair. The top-tier cast including Tilda Swinton as a character called Social Services may be star overload but each actor performs small miracles. Murray and McDormand excel at showing a faltering marriage in microcosm. ""Stop feeling sorry for yourself"" she tells her husband each in a separate bed. ""Why?"" says he instilling one word with a lifetime of meaning. On children theyre agreed ""Were all they have and its not enough."" As the hurricane whips up a perhaps too busy climax Anderson links the everyday and the extraordinary with virtuoso artistry. Shot with a poets eye by Robert Yeoman and lifted by an Alexandre Desplat score that samples Mozart Hank Williams and Benjamin Britten the hilarious and heartfelt Moonrise Kingdom is a consistent pleasure. By evoking the joys and terrors of childhood it reminds us how to be alive.

Were You Followed? Credit Focus Features From Moonrise Kingdom - Loaded Question Loaded Question Credit Focus Features In the first few minutes of Wes Andersons Moonrise Kingdom the camera tracks horizontally and vertically along the cross-sectioned rooms of a house. Its one of the writer-directors signature visual tics one that like many of his techniques announces his art as something artificial. Anderson isnt breaking the fourth wall hes eliminating it literally all these rooms have only three in order that we might glimpse the carefully choreographed ballet he has arranged for us inside. That dance starts in the Bishop household a family living on the fictitious New England island of New Penzance in the 1960s. (Andersons usual fetishization of that decade has finally led him to set a movie there.) The younger kids play on braided rugs listening to Benjamin Brittens ""Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra"" on a toy record player as mom and dad go about their evening routine. The eldest daughter Suzy (Kara Hayward) obsessively scans the horizon with binoculars. When the setting shifts its to an encampment of ""khaki scouts"" a troop under the command of the strict but earnest Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton). Hes about to find that one of his young charges 12-year-old Sam (Jared Gilman) has gone AWOL. Sam and Suzy in the grips of young on-the-verge-of-pubescence love have plans to run away together. Even once Andersons camera leaves the Bishops house for the camp his shots retain the same tracking motions. The walls are gone entirely once in the outdoor camp but the feeling that this is still a kind of dollhouse remains. And if a dollhouse can be the setting for endless hours of childhood storytelling Moonrise Kingdom -- and really almost any Anderson film -- is that childhood toy blown up to life size to tell stories played out by living breathing human actors. i Bill Murray Tilda Swinton Bruce Willis and Edward Norton play some of the adults who search for Sam and Suzy as a violent storm approaches their island. Focus Features hide caption toggle caption Focus Features Bill Murray Tilda Swinton Bruce Willis and Edward Norton play some of the adults who search for Sam and Suzy as a violent storm approaches their island. Focus Features Yet even as dolls made flesh they and their surroundings still retain the manufactured perfection of miniatures Colors are too bright too perfectly coordinated. Actors speak in self-aware deadpan the adults with a stilted affectation the children echoing the endearing amateurism of 60s Peanuts specials. Andersons camera setups -- the windows through which we see his world -- are meticulously framed with attention-grabbing unnatural symmetries. Yet for all the self-conscious distancing techniques and quirky humor Anderson employs when hes at his best his work can be surprising in its disarming emotion. The surplus of style is the distraction he deploys while he sneaks in through our hearts back door. Thats exactly what he accomplishes with Moonrise Kingdom. The surplus of style is the distraction [Anderson] deploys while he sneaks in through our hearts back door. Anderson with co-writer Roman Coppola constructs a heartfelt fantasy of young love an adult re-imagining of the moment in adolescence when that bond is uncomplicated and pure perfect and forever. Sam expert khaki scout is ready to take on the world and the wilderness pitching perfect pup tents and lovingly preparing franks and beans over the campfire for the object of his affection -- who has run away armed only with a suitcase full of library books her record player and her favorite Francoise Hardy record. For contrast he sets Suzy and Sams story of love on the run against the less idealized backdrop of the adults searching the island for them. Relationships among them are as stormy as the hurricane bearing down on New Penzance Grown-up love is complicated and compromised flawed and fleeting. Sams foster parents have abandoned him. Suzys parents (Frances McDormand and Anderson regular Bill Murray) can barely stand one another and her mother is having an affair with the islands lone sad police officer (Bruce Willis at his subtly comic best). Rushing into adulthood themselves Sam and Suzy begin to experience the first imperfections in their own relationship once the hermetic seal of youthful idealism is broken. One early conflict ranks among the most heartbreaking moments in any of Andersons films as Suzy desperate to be rid of her own broken family romanticizes Sams orphanhood. ""I love you"" he tells her the pain of his loneliness nearly catching up to his usually businesslike demeanor ""but you dont know what youre talking about."" This is a director who is an undeniable expert at visual precision and Moonrise Kingdom shot in grainy dreamy super 16mm is as beautiful to look at as any of his films. But its easy to overlook how in moments like these -- quick but meaningful bits of dialogue or the awkward innocent joyfulness of Suzy and Sam dancing in their underwear on the beach -- Anderson has the ability to control our emotions just as expertly as his camera.

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday May 24 2012 107 PM Title Moonrise Kingdom Film Info PG-13 Mild sexuality. Area theaters. While wooing his preteen sweetheart the young hero of Wes Andersons ""Moonrise Kingdom"" offers her this advice ""Poems dont have to rhyme you know. Theyre just supposed to be creative."" Though not as impactful as Andersons strongest works -- including its adolescent cousin ""Rushmore"" -- ""Kingdom"" unfolds with an asymmetrical lyricism of its own. Newcomers Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman play our would-be lovers Suzy and Sam. They meet on a romantically remote New England island where he goes to camp and she lives with her distracted parents (Frances McDormand and Bill Murray). The orphaned awkward Sam is as his scoutmaster (Edward Norton) observes ""the least popular scout in the troop. By a significant margin."" So he assumes no one will miss him when he runs away with beautiful rebellious Suzy. But of course two 12-year-olds cant disappear without repercussions. All around them are dangers they only partially understand natural disasters mean-spirited kids uncaring adults (including Tilda Swinton overemphatic as a bureaucratic social worker). Fortunately they also have fate faith and a kind-hearted cop (Bruce Willis) on their side. As always Anderson devotes himself meticulously to each element creating scene after scene of exquisite precision. The effect while impressive can also be jarring or even off-putting. On the one hand we are drawn to the storys lovely emotional resonance. On the other we are distanced by the self-conscious whimsy that fetishizes every detail of delivery and design. But here the formal compositions are poignantly undercut by childish innocence. Even as Anderson pushes us away the kids -- and a wonderful Willis as their self-appointed protector -- reach out and pull us back in. We desperately want them to achieve -- what? Love? Acceptance? Maybe contentment will do. The grownups around them have long given up on any notions of true happiness. But for children precocious enough to reside within their own realm every dream still remains within reach.

With the sole exception of his marvelous 2009 animated fable Fantastic Mr. Fox he has clung to his rarefied Salinger-meets-The Graduate-meets-music-video-meets-postmodern-TV-ads whimsicality as if it were under glass which in a sense it is. What has changed is Andersons place in the culture. At the time of Rushmore (1998) and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) many claimed -- with validity -- that he was a defining voice of his time an irony-generation heir to Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen. But the awe over Andersons work now exists in a kind of auteurist echo chamber. In his new film Moonrise Kingdom Sam (Jared Gilman) an orphaned 12-year-old Khaki Scout in owlish glasses and a merit- badge-laden uniform with a yellow kerchief goes AWOL from his camp by running off to the meadowed wilds of Penzance Island. The year is 1965 and Sam isnt alone. He has invited along a very pretty girl named Suzy (Kara Hayward) who wears blue eye shadow and carries a portable 45 record player. Shes running away from home and the two have concocted a plan to meet up and wander as a kind of romantic great escape. Are they in puppy love? Thats the idea though in Andersons hands their relationship remains an abstract fantasy of tremulous young romance -- which is fine in theory since thats sometimes what very young romance is. Yet all these two really have in common is their junior Wes Anderson acerbic innocence. Sam who says everything with invisible quizzical quote marks brings to mind Marten Holden Weiners studied oddball performance as Sally Drapers friend-and-maybe-more on Mad Men and Suzy though we keep being told that shes ""troubled"" seems merely distant and wise beyond her years in a nonchalant way. The two wander they dance on the beach to a French-pop ye-ye song and theyre pursued with increasing frenzy by everyone else in the movie. That includes Frances McDormand (at her most shrewish) and Bill Murray (at his most disgruntled) as Suzys unhappy parents Bruce Willis as a benign cop and Edward Norton as an officious scoutmaster. Anderson hasnt lost his puckishly charming genius for cinema-as-diorama visuals. Yet a lot happens in this film and not a lot of it matters. For some viewers Moonrise Kingdom may be movie heaven another bric-a-brac-jammed bauble to place alongside The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou and The Darjeeling Limited. Personally though I wish that Anderson would come out from under the glass or at least change what hes doing under there.

Indeed they are more than plausible; theyre perfect from the fitted uniforms and yellow canvas tents of the troop of ""Khaki Scouts"" headed by cigarette-smoking Edward Norton to the achingly picturesque island home where the brood of children belonging to Bill Murray and Frances McDormand sit around listening to the Leonard Bernstein recording of ""A Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra."" (Im not going to bother questioning whether that record existed in 1965; some production intern probably spent half a day tracking down its history.)Yet as usual with an Anderson movie this meticulous and convincing detail does not add up to realism but -- depending on your perspective -- to something either much less or much more than that. Something that could be described and has been in all kinds of ways As fantasy or fairytale; as a whimsical miniature under glass; as a diorama created by a brilliant obsessive-compulsive child. All reasonable descriptions at least up to a point -- and Im on board for all of it. Ive pretty much been on Andersons wavelength from Day One -- or at least from ""Rushmore"" which isnt quite Day One. Thats not the same thing as saying that I think all his movies work equally well or that he doesnt occasionally lapse into laziness or self-indulgence. (Ill have to give ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" another chance one of these days but I feel pretty confident that was a misstep.)I understand why Andersons films drive some viewers nuts in fact and I would simply respond that it should be clear by now that his vision of cinema and the world is idiosyncratic and not to everyones taste and that theres no point sitting around hoping hell become more normal. But heres what I reject completely The idea that the artificiality or hyperrealism (a better word I think) of Andersons worlds -- which is admittedly cranked up pretty high here -- is fundamentally pretentious and insincere or that it reflects some kind of ""kidult"" refusal of grown-up emotion. Yes Andersons principal subject and arguably his only subject is the collision between the emotional lives of adults and children and the paradoxical tragicomedy it can so often produce. But if Andersons adults yearn for the comparative simplicity of childhood while his children long for the big important feelings they believe (wrongly) go with growing up that in itself is a distinctly adult perspective.""Moonrise Kingdom"" takes place at the tail-end of summer -- that season which is more charged with a rueful sense of passage than any other. Its preteen lovers Sam and Suzy (played by newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward respectively) most certainly aspire to the grand passions of Tristan and Isolde or Abelard and Heloise and its entirely possible theyve heard of them. They first met backstage during a performance of Brittens ""Noyes Fludde"" at the island of New Penzances only church when Sam was in his Khaki Scout uniform and coonskin cap and Suzy was wearing a bird costume. (The use of Britten of all possible composers as this films musical muse is wonderfully unlikely and totally Andersonian.) After a hot and heavy epistolary romance they conspire to run away together -- as it happens (so we are told by on-screen narrator Bob Balaban) just three days before a major hurricane will hit New Penzance.As irresistible as our young lovers are -- Sam with his corncob pipe and camp-tested scouting skills Suzy in her saddle shoes and with her dangerous pre-Lolita sexuality -- this isnt a movie about kids and they are Potemkin protagonists. Against the certainty and clarity of the childhood world we see the real heroes of New Penzance Nortons upright Scout Master Ward who confesses his secret fears to a reel-to-reel tape recorder in the depths of the night; Bruce Williss Captain Sharp the islands only cop whos in love with Karas artsy bespectacled mother Laura (McDormand); Murray as the gentle lawyerly Walt (Lauras husband and Karas dad) who knows he is being cuckolded but cant quite bring himself to do anything about it. All these lonely people are portrayed with wonderful delicacy and sensitivity right in the middle of an artificial construction that contains plenty of shtick. I honestly dont think Ive ever seen Norton and Willis in particular be better than they are here. You Might Also Like Sam and Suzys tempestuous love affair along with that looming act of God thats boiling up out there in the Atlantic will not merely bring all these people together but will give them an excuse to escape their everyday routine and their ingrained fears. In that sense and in others too ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a deeply romantic film perhaps the sweetest and most compassionate Anderson has ever made. What has evidently confused some viewers is the fact that its also an obsessively curated re-creation of an era that never quite existed a meticulous storybook version of 1965 thats more perfect than the original. In real life Boy Scout tents of that era were made of canvas but were never yellow and government social workers never wore Salvation Army-style uniforms as Tilda Swintons officious character (whose only name appears to be ""Social Services"") does here. And so on.I suspect that people conflate the artificiality of Andersons movies with inauthenticity or insincerity (different things to be sure) because his artificiality is obvious and worn on the surface whereas the highly mannered films of say Martin Scorsese masquerade as realism. Im not picking that example at random by the way; Scorsese has identified Anderson as his favorite among younger American directors I suspect because he sees a kindred spirit. The two men have very different aesthetics but both are visionaries who see the world through a personal lens and both are technical virtuosi concerned with managing every detail of their created universes. Youre free to prefer one directors work to the others of course but ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"" are every bit as obsessed with style and production design as any Anderson film. (The cinematography in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is by Robert D. Yeoman who has shot all of Andersons live-action films. The production designer is Adam Stockhausen the art director is Gerald Sullivan and the spectacular costumes are by Kasia Walicka-Maimone.) To the extent that ""Moonrise Kingdom"" can be described as nostalgia it isnt personal nostalgia since Anderson himself was not born until 1969. Very likely its an attempt to create a fantasy version of the lost world of his own parents. I wonder whether Scout Master Ward when the magical summer of 65 fades into memory will get married move to Texas and have a son. The island cabin of Walt and Laura feels like a creation out of a classic childrens novel but it is imbued with the sadness of a failing adult marriage. In the third act it feels like Anderson and co-writer Roman Coppola get a little lost in plot shenanigans and they introduce several extra characters (Jason Schwartzman Harvey Keitel and Swinton all show up in small roles) to little effect. But all of ""Moonrise Kingdom"" -- from Sams miniature stolen canoe to the Benjamin Britten excerpts to Captain Sharps heartbreaking bachelor trailer home -- is a labor of love as pure and sweet as the lovelorn letters of its young runaways. Wes Anderson can fool some people maybe but hes not fooling me.""Moonrise Kingdom"" opens this week in New York and Los Angeles with wider release to follow. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

This auteur cant get enough of sad kids wistfully reading novels with intricately painted dustjackets listening to records on plastic tone-arm record players and dreaming of liberation. Not for nothing does one of the flashbacks in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" reference E.L. Konigsburgs ""From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler"" a 1967 tale of two precocious but ignored youngsters who sneak away during a class field trip and manage to live undetected for several days in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Also read Moonrise Kingdom Is Wes Andersons Ode to Arrested Development Theres an even stronger feeling of ""Frankweiler"" in the 1965-set ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and while this movie wont win over detractors who think that Andersons work is precious and fussy the comedy does see the filmmaker firmly rooted in his comfort zone. Fans will be glad to hear this. On a tiny island off the coast of New England orphaned scout Sam (Jared Gilman) and troubled Suzy (Kara Hayward) bond instantly when they meet. (In true Anderson style its backstage at a local performance of Benjamin Brittens ""Noyes Fludde"" -- hes in a scout uniform shes dressed as a raven.) Sam has just been rejected by a new set of foster parents (after accidentally lighting their shed on fire) and Suzys misunderstood by her mom (Frances McDormand) and dad (Bill Murray) who are both lawyers so the youngsters decide to run away. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" often resembles a novelization of Godards ""Pierrot le Fou"" as conceived by storybook artist Richard Scarry While the islands authority figures (police captain Bruce Willis scoutmaster Edward Norton) rally to track down the kids the tweens fall in love like Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina dancing to ye-ye singer Francoise Hardy as they stare at each other and at the camera tracking toward them for a close-up. But this isnt just the French New Wave reinterpreted for the Justin Bieber generation; Anderson is one of our most dryly funny filmmakers and his screenplay written with Roman Coppola overflows with eccentric characters and minimalist-screwball ripostes. (""Was he a good dog?"" asks Suzy about the scout troups terrier. ""Who can say?"" responds Sam.) Visually Anderson knows where to find the laughs in two kids hiking and camping while lugging around an enormous plastic suitcase; in fact there are few directors out there who are as good at making inanimate objects (treehouses lighthouses ponchos stationery maps) humorous in and of themselves. The cast which also includes Tilda Swinton as a character known only as ""Social Services"" has been instructed to play things as deadpan as possible. ""Remember"" one imagines Anderson telling his players ""the last word out of your mouth should have the same inflection as the first."" Like many of Andersons films this one does start to lag a bit in the third act but if theres any real feeling of disappointment about this sweet and strange romance its that it inevitably pales next to ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" That stop-motion animated feature felt like the apotheosis of the filmmaker where his penchants for obsessive art direction and hyper-stylization were a perfect fit with the medium. Still as live-action Anderson goes ""Moonrise Kingdom"" ranks among his best and certainly feels like an improvement over ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" (where the submarine was the most interesting character) and ""The Darjeeling Limited"" (which left me wanting the towels and the luggage but not caring about the people). Its an oddball love story made by a director with his own crazy affection for his job. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The dapper auteur behind such idiosyncratic and polarizing works as The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited opens his latest feature a continuously surprising and delightful adolescent romance set in 1965 in what appears to be a dollhouse. Everything down to the miniature chairs and oval area rugs is placed with utmost (some might say fanatical) care and Robert D. Yeomans ceaselessly tracking camera takes in all the sights while moving along the usual rocket-science-precise axes. Call it a gift to fans and a riposte to detractors The cowriter-director (he collaborated on the script with Roman Coppola) gives everyone what they expect up front--all the preciously fussed-over details that are very much in keeping with Andersons shoebox-diorama aesthetic--and once thats out of the way life seeps into frame. As it turns out this is the human-size residence of Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) a dour 12-year-old with sad raccoon eyes who spends her time reading filched library books listening to Benjamin Britten compositions and peering longingly through an ever-present pair of binoculars. She lives with her unhappily married lawyer parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and her younger brothers in the small island community of New Penzance New England (the film was shot off the coast of Rhode Island) where as a loquacious onscreen narrator (Bob Balaban) stiffly informs us a devastating storm is due to hit in three days. Suzy has little time for such concerns; theres enough of a rebellious tempest brewing inside her which makes her a kindred spirit of outcast Khaki Scout Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman). They meet appropriately enough during a church pageant performance of Brittens biblical opera Noyes Fludde (""What kind of bird are you?"" Sam pointedly asks his soon-to-be sweetheart) and strike up a yearlong correspondence that ends with them running away into the forest. Most of the movies bewitching first half details the duos adventures as they work their way toward one of New Penzances seaside inlets avoiding capture by the melancholy local police captain (Bruce Willis) an inept scout leader (Edward Norton) and Sams own armed-to-the-teeth troop. Anderson is fully in his element lending a storybook quality to the lushly verdant setting while still maintaining a very real sense of danger. Even in the most idyllic sequences as when Suzy and Sam do a hilariously awkward Badlands-esque beachside dance to a Francoise Hardy pop song the threat of physical and emotional violence is always present and does occasionally erupt. (One stunning shot of a crimson-stained pair of scissors reveals what will always separate Anderson from his many second-rate imitators His characters bleed.) After the adults catch the young lovebirds the film becomes more frenetic and scattered a disappointing though not ultimately damaging loss of focus. Tilda Swinton pops up as a too-cartoonishly villainous character named Social Services and theres some scout-troop sneaking around that comes off as a weak-tea cousin to the jailbreak climax of the directors stop-motion-animated Fantastic Mr. Fox. But theres also plenty that moves the spirit in that uniquely Andersonian way from the endearing amateurishness of young newcomers Hayward and Gilman (their natural fumbling is perfect for a story about naive first love) to the stellar support lent by Murray McDormand Norton and Willis who each convey a lifetime of concealed hurts with every gesture and deadpan-absurd line reading. Like its obvious antecedents (Francois Truffauts Small Change or Louis Malles Zazie dans le Metro) Moonrise Kingdom is a story of childhood viewed from a wizened vantage point. A lesser movie would attempt to set the two precocious protagonists on a grown-up path or alternatively posit the characters callow smarts as an enlightened state of mind for all to aspire to. But as shown by its spectacular sturm-und-drang finale (imagine the church-steeple confrontation in Metropolis as directed by Dr. Seuss) Andersons romantic fantasia is after something much more complicated and profound--an ever-renewing balance between the hopes of youth and the disappointments of age.

Twelve-year-old Sam (Jared Gilman) a scrawny bespectacled outcast with an unusual aptitude for cartography disappears from the Khaki Scout camp absconding with a couple of bedrolls and an air rifle and leaving behind a ""resignation"" letter for scoutmaster Randy Ward (Edward Norton) to find. Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward)--a just-pubescent bad seed straddling the line between innocence and sexual precocity in a minidress paired with kneesocks and ""Sunday-school shoes"" --disappears from her own dollhouse-like home her self-absorbed distracted lawyer parents Laura (Frances McDormand) and Walt (Bill Murray) initially none the wiser. Soon enough the law of the island Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) knocks on Laura and Walts door while making the rounds in search of Sam and Laura finds a box of ""intimate"" correspondence between the two kids--who met once the summer before--suggesting they have run away together. Aided by what remains of Wards troop (""Its a chance to do some first-class scouting"") the grown-ups mobilize to find the fugitive young lovers and bring them back to safety--thereby wrecking Sam and Suzys thrilling romantic idyll. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Shot on Super 16mm the visible grain giving each image a wonderfully tactile depth and life Wes Andersons Moonrise Kingdom is in a lot of ways the ur-Wes Anderson film. The director who co-wrote the script with his Darjeeling Limited collaborator Roman Coppola leaves his usual stylistic fingerprints--horizontal pans across the just-so tableau; the casting of Murray and Jason Schwartzman as a kind of know-it-all fixer (but not noticeably Owen Wilson who has participated in every previous Anderson film); the hermetic world defined by its highly specific often too-perfect design. But its also his most fully realized work The tics that have sometimes distanced viewers from real emotions in his previous films (particularly the fetishizing of analogue objects and characters who greet the world in costume props in hand) are here much more integrated into the fabric of the films period construction and its story. And the newcomers to Andersons kingdom--Norton (a failed Marvel muscleman having been replaced as the Hulk by Mark Ruffalo) and Willis (whose increasingly apparent age complicates his invincible badass persona)--are each given a chance to prove themselves as heroes in surprising ways.Within Andersons filmography The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou might be the most direct precursor to Moonrise in that both are essentially adventures--elaborate larger-than-life movie-movies--and both are punctured by violence with real consequences that seem shocking within the playful spaces Anderson meticulously creates. But Moonrises story more directly references young-adult fantasy fiction both the explicitly magical variety and the more earthbound strain featuring ordinary kids who manage to pull off extraordinary plots in an effort to shake off the constraints of a mundane life. The escape Sam engineers for the pair making full use of his Khaki Scout survivalist training is dangerous and crazy but its also a way for the boy--an orphan who is on the verge of being dumped by his foster family--to exercise control and to show off his underappreciated talents to a receptive audience. Suzy doesnt have it so bad at home but shes beautiful angry for no specific reason and bored so Sams flattering gaze gives her something she isnt getting probably didnt know she needed and now wont easily be able to live without.Rated PG-13 Moonrise Kingdom takes the form of old-fashioned pre-teen literature but as everything made by Wes Anderson does so knowingly. Set against a devastating storm the outcome of the films gorgeously CGI-enhanced climactic adventure emphasizes both the ephemerality of pre-teen feelings and the ways in which our inability to go back and relive a cherished moment fossilizes it in memory. Its portrait of young love is both mature and defiantly utopian.Suzy and Sams steadfast romanticism is a form of resistance which is thrown into relief by the quiet despair of the adults in their lives. Lonely even--or particularly--when not alone the parents and authority figures in Moonrise have long ago given up on the possibility of transformative romance or love as salvation. Their melancholy situates Moonrises fantasy in reality--which only makes the films swooning re-creation of Sam and Suzys foolish first-time future-blind leaps into the unknown all the more exhilarating.1 Poised for adventure Murray McDormand Willis et al.Niko Tavernise Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Karina Longworth Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

(Photo Niko Tavernise/Courtesy of Focus Features) One shot and you know its a Wes Anderson film no mistaking it for anyone elses. The frames are off-symmetrical their strong human centers unevenly flanked the balance precarious as if existence itself were a seesaw. Yet theres also something airlesscongealedabout those frames. Visually Moonrise Kingdom is Andersons most hermetic movie (which is saying a lot) its mixture of passion and museum-diorama detachment singularly odd. It left me bemused instead of moved but true Andersonites will likely float away in a state of nirvana. The film which ends with a prominent dedication to Andersons girlfriend writer Juman Malouf is a love story a union of two lonely capacious inner worlds. We see the girl first 12-year-old Suzy (Kara Hayward) who peers with binoculars through the window of her familys large beach house on an island off New England. She watches her mother Mrs. Bishop (Frances McDormand) meet in secret with a lovelorn sheriff Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) while her father Mr. Bishop (Bill Murray) is off somewhere being irrelevant. Across the island 12-year-old orphan Sam (Jared Gilman) is on a scouting expeditionor at least is supposed to be. When the kind but ineffectual Khaki Scout master Ward (Edward Norton) opens Sams tent he finds a door cut out the side and no boy. Jiminy Cricket he flew the coop he exclaims. It soon becomes clear that Sam and Suzy are making their painstaking way toward each other with the unromantic grown-ups in pursuit. The synopsis above is far too plain to convey the auteurist-bait mise-en-scene of Moonrise Kingdom which opens with a fluid stately left-to-right shot past color-coordinated dollhouselike rooms. At one point in the overture Anderson lingers on an impressionistic needlepoint of a beach house and the image returns when the camera zooms back from Suzy in the tower window to reveal her inside the house in the design. So this universe is a big recursive art object. Throughout the sequence the Bishop children listen to Benjamin Brittens The Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra the narrator busily breaking the ensemble down to its component parts. Anderson is all but begging the Frenchies (and Frenchies-at-heart) to deconstruct his movie. The opening-night Cannes Film Festival audience must have been speaking in tongues. Wherefore all this style? Writing about an especially ostentatious production Kenneth Tynan quoted French critic Hippolyte Taine La perfection du style cest la disparition du style. Real style in other words doesnt call attention to itself because to do so would be unstylish. The Anderson cult would dispute this coinage finding in the directors work not just beauty but ugly truth. Sometimes I concur. There have been moments in his films when Ive wondered if that formal beauty was meant to be ironic if Anderson was suggesting that inside these hypercontrolled frames his individual characters were chafing at their lack of control over their emotions and destinies. The best case you can make for the style of Moonrise Kingdom (the swoony title cries out to be translated into French) is that its a film unfolding in the mind of its feverishly creative male protagonist a powerless adolescent who longs to divide contain control the space just so. That boy impresario was first seen in Rushmore and to a degree every Wes Anderson movie is a Max Fisher Productionwith Max in this case cribbing some fancy horizontal moves from Peter Greenaways The Cook the Thief His Wife and Her Lover. The script continues the sad tale of children whose parents cant parent. Informed that Sam has run away from the scouts his foster father (Larry Pine) tells the sheriff not to bother bringing him back. Suzy whose father and mother are preoccupied with their own problems tells Sam that she envies him because orphans lead such special lives in the Harry Potterlike magical adventures she reads. Replies Sam who has just apologized in advance in case he wets their shared bed I love you but I dont know what youre talking about. Moonrise Kingdom has other lines that good enough to make me wish that Anderson hadnt reverted so aggressively to form (i.e. formalism) after moving the other way in The Darjeeling Limited. The movie is a showcase for cinematographer Robert Yeoman production designer Adam Stockhausen costume designer Kasia Walicka Maimone and the tag-team composers Britten and Alexandre Desplat but not so much for the actors. McDormand Willis and Norton seem as if theyre tithing their likable selves (and bankable names) to the Church of Wesalthough Murray has one affecting moment when his character sits up in bed and says I hope the roof flies off and I get sucked up into space. Youd be better off without me and McDormand replies Stop feeling sorry for yourself. In the lets-add-another-instrument-to-the-mix Anderson spirit Bob Balaban pops up as an island historian and talks to the camera. Tilda Swinton as the orphan-snatching Social Services wears her luminous violet suit beautifully. The kids are fine in their debuts Haywards lively blue eyes registering under gobs of mascara Gilman somewhat upstaged by glasses that cover a third of his face and a raccoon cap that takes care of his hair. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Wes Andersons films have all taken place in a stylized version of the real world -- from the Texas plains of ""Bottle Rocket"" to the meadows and dens of ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" -- but ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is the first to be set in an entirely fictional location New Penzance Island home to a handful of full-time residents a favorite destination for Scout troops and the setting for a typically dry droll and sweet Anderson outing. One morning at the tail end of the summer of 1965 Scoutmaster Ward (Edward Norton) emerges from his tent at the Khaki Scouts camp on New Penzance Island to find that one troop member -- 12-year-old Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) a precocious orphan not well liked by his fellow boys -- has flown the coop. Sam has a rendezvous with Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) a girl his age who lives with her family on the island and with whom he has been corresponding by letter over the past year. Suzy and Sam want to run away together in the manner of young lovers since time immemorial. Scoutmaster Ward activates the rest of the troop to go searching for their lost member joined by local police captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Suzys attorney parents Walt (Bill Murray) and Laura (Frances McDormand). Social Services represented by a woman who only ever refers to herself as Social Services (played by Tilda Swinton) also gets involved eventually as do Scout leaders at nearby camps (played by Jason Schwartzman and Harvey Keitel) and a local man (Bob Balaban) who serves as narrator. Also Check Out Alt Weekly - Moonrise Kingdom and More Evading capture while living in the wild via Sams expert camping and survivalist skills Sam and Suzy enjoy a chaste tender romance that has the distinction of being both whimsical -- Suzy as precocious as Sam (and every other youth in a Wes Anderson movie) has brought along a battery-operated record player to provide entertainment -- and heartrendingly realistic. That disarming mixture of quaint hipsterism and genuine emotion is what makes Andersons best work so effective and its in full force here thanks to winningly unaffected performances by Gilman and Hayward. Though its been five years since Andersons last live-action feature (""The Darjeeling Limited"") his fans will be glad to know he has not deviated from his formalized visual style and fondness for elaborately composed shots. Co-writing with Roman Coppola his humor remains subtle and wry as the young characters -- who are definitely the focus here -- are as well-spoken as the adults. I know there are people who find Andersons films too self-consciously twee to be enjoyable. I dont agree but I know those people exist. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" certainly wont change their minds; it is every inch a Wes Anderson joint and he isnt exploring much new territory. But dont dismiss it. This is terrific work by an enviably talented filmmaker with a wistful poignance that will stick with you.

The Stettheimer Dollhouse -- a 6-ft.-high two-story 12-room edifice that its creator Carrie Stettheimer worked on for nearly two decades in the early part of the 20th century -- is stocked with period furniture bric-a-brac wallpaper and most impressively tiny paintings created by Stettheimers friends in the art world. Marcel Duchamp contributed a 3-in. version of his Nude Descending a Staircase. Wes Anderson also builds dollhouses life-size ones for the characters in his movies. The first scene of Moonrise Kingdom which on May 16 opened the 65th Cannes Film Festival is a left-to-right tracking shot of some rooms on the upper floor of the Bishop house on the New England island of New Penzance in 1965. In one room is Mother (Frances McDormand); in another Father (Bill Murray) reading a newspaper; in a third their three young sons at play. Cut to the front of the house where 12-year-old Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) peers through binoculars into the distance or the fateful future to which she hopes to escape. (READ Mary Pols on Fantastic Mr. Fox) Anderson is a fashioner of worlds no less meticulously outfitted than Stettheimers. The home in The Royal Tenenbaums is as eccentric as the family that occupies it; the subterranean abode of the feral dandy in Andersons stop-motion film Fantastic Mr. Fox is folksy enough to appear in a vulpine House amp; Garden. The directors camera style is every bit as obsessively regimented. Shots travel across a straight plane or forward but never diagonally and reaction shots are calibrated at an exact 180-degree (or less frequently 90-degree) angle to the preceding shot. The pictures might be taken by a robo-security apparatus designed by a genius of geometry. The question Andersons dollhouse movies inevitably raise Does anybody live inside? Sometimes you bet. In his 1999 breakout comedy Rushmore a willful life force burns in Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) a 15-year-old prep-school dude who loves a pretty teacher. And dapper Mr. Fox as voiced by George Clooney applies his wiles with a crafty charisma. But the pleasure in watching an Anderson film is often rarefied like examining the innards of a Joseph Cornell box. The wayward brothers in The Darjeeling Limited and the oceanographer (Bill Murray) who fancies himself a modern Ahab in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou seem stiff puppets confined by Andersons elaborate visual strategy. Their dollhouse is a jailhouse the camera their stern sentry. (READ Corliss on The Darjeeling Limited) Part of the considerable appeal of Moonrise Kingdom written by the director and Roman Coppola (Francis son and Schwartzmans cousin) is its notion that two of Andersons dolls want to bust out of his stylistic straitjacket. Suzy the girl with the binoculars has a secret assignation with Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) an orphan incarcerated at the Billingsley Foster Family for Boys. Theyre kind of soulmates -- brainmates really for both kids are as bright and restless as Max Fischer and the Tenenbaums prodigy children. Suzy reads fiction for advanced girls and listens to Francoise Hardy records; Sam a member of the local Khaki Scout troop is an expert woodsman. Most important they feel the kinship of the imprisoned. They have planned their breakout for almost a year ever since they met at a school pageant of Benjamin Brittens community opera Noyes Fludde at which Suzy was dressed as a raven. Suzy and Sam are truly venturing into the unknown; they understand what theyre running from but not to. New Penzance is after all an island; their escape is largely a metaphorical statement. But being alone together has an innocent thrill. Sam arrives in their designated meadow with a bouquet of wildflowers and later gives her earrings hes made by attaching insects to fishhooks; Suzy brings her favorite books to read to him. The two also realize that their shared isolation demands an emotional payoff. Precocious intellectually but not sexually the young lovers must improvise at eroticism. Suzy tells Sam how to French kiss -- she probably read it somewhere. This part of Moonrise Kingdom (the name they give the secret cove where they plan to hide) is a film-noir love story daubed in the sunny tones of late summer on Narragansett. In his Hollywood Reporter review Todd McCarthy describes the movies plot as ""They Live by Night with 12-year-olds."" Another late-40s tale of romantic doom shares this movies title Frank Borzages Moonrise about an older young man (Dane Clark) on the rural run and his love for a more upscale girl (Gail Russell). Gilman and Hayward both new to the screen must feel their way to acting as Sam and Suzy grope toward love; the two performers are as naive and winning as the characters are solemn willful and 12. (MORE Wes Anderson Talks to TIME) The movie also has adults Murray and McDormand Edward Norton as Sams Khaki Scout instructor Bruce Willis as the local sheriff whos sympathetic to Sams plight and Tilda Swinton as the Social Services official (her name in the film is Social Services) determined to put the boy in juvenile detention. But they are no more mature than their charges incidental both to the agony and ecstasy of love on the cusp of adolescence and to the movies mood of serious whimsy. So cheers for a Cannes director who has infused his technical mastery with radiant life. In the Museum of the World of Wes Anderson the dolls are dancing.

What is childhood if not an island cut off from the grown-up world around it and what is first love if not a secret cove known only to the two parties caught in its spell? While no less twee than Wes Andersons earlier pictures ""Moonrise Kingdom"" supplies a poignant metaphor for adolescence itself in which a universally appealing tale of teenage romance cuts through the smug eccentricity and heightened artificiality with which Anderson has allowed himself to be pigeonholed. A prestigious opening-night slot at Cannes lends luster to Focus May 25 release but not enough to grow his audience. While Anderson is essentially a miniaturist making dollhouse movies about meticulously appareled characters in perfectly appointed environments each successive film finds him working on a more ambitious scale. Co-written by Roman Coppola ""Moonrise Kingdom"" may not be set anywhere so exotic as a Mediterranean boat (""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"") or a trans-Indian train (""The Darjeeling Limited"") but it feels even more finely detailed than any of his previous live-action outings. Still the love story reads loud and clear charming those not put off by all the productions potentially distracting ornamentation. Newcomer Kara Hayward plays Suzy who lives in an overstuffed lighthouse on the East Coast island of New Penzance with three younger brothers and two immature-acting parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand). She has captured the heart of Sam (Jared Gilman also making his bigscreen debut) a 12-year-old orphan and the outcast of his Khaki Scout troop (the other members of which all blur together hardly distinguishable beyond the varying beige shades of their uniforms). Sam first spotted Suzy the summer before and the two have been pen pals ever since plotting to run away from their not-uncomfortable normal lives in order to spend a week or so roughing it together. While Sam endearingly draws upon the wilderness survival tactics taught by his troops otherwise irresponsible Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton looking his most boyish) Suzy proves somewhat less practical packing several hardcover library books a battery-powered record player and her pet kitten for the adventure. Opposite Sams ugly duckling Suzy is already a swan She listens to French pop and paints her eyes a la Sophia Loren suggesting the type of girl whod be running with leather-jacket high-school boys in real life rather than indulging an awkward nearsighted daydreamer. And yet Sam like ""Rushmores"" Max Fischer before him lacks nothing in self-confidence rendered all the more hilarious by Gilmans comical seriousness and slight speech impediment. By contrast Hayward conveys both intelligence and poise reminding that young ladies mature faster than boys. Anderson recently told the New York Times that the girl who inspired Suzys character was never even aware of his affections and that explains a lot. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is nothing if not a nostalgic fantasy-reinvention of first love transposed to 1965 (a fact supplied by Bob Balaban who doubles as both the pics narrator and its most sartorially silly-looking character). Despite the absurdly all-American backdrop the film reveals a particularly French influence in its use of composer Alexandre Desplats sprightly instrumentations and its admirably non-patronizing approach toward adolescents which recalls the precocious protags of Louis Malles ""Murmur of the Heart"" and ""Zazie in the Metro."" Throughout the picture retains Andersons signature aesthetic Whether dollying through the rooms of Suzys house squarely on-axis or peering straight forward from the bow of Sams canoe the wide-angle 16mm lensing effectively places everything including outdoor shots within an artificial proscenium the camera remaining fixed except for the occasional 90-degree whip pan. This carefully orchestrated dynamic runs counter to most lovers-on-the-lam movies where naturalistic acting and handheld cinematography typically enhance the outlaw spirit. In this case Andersons stylized approach masks the young actors inexperience while embracing a familiar genre to draw auds in to Sam and Suzys runaway escapade. As his fellow Khaki Scouts organize a search party and her parents enlist the local police captain (a ridiculous-looking Bruce Willis) the couple have few hideout options from which to choose on such a small island. Eventually they find a quiet beach generically labeled ""Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet"" and claim it as their own. Thanks to an approaching hurricane this secret spot will soon exist only in their memories. Naturally the storm coincides with an elaborate and rather tiresome third-act chase involving Social Services (Tilda Swinton) the Khaki Scouts humorless commanding officer (Harvey Keitel) and a dose of weak dramatic irony in the form of a church-theater production of ""Noyes Fludde."" For the jejune duo the whole adventure brings their first wave of adult problems; one suspects they will soon long for the days when their troubles could be contained someplace as charmed as New Penzance. In the meantime ""Moonrise Kingdom"" represents a sort of non-magical Neverland -- that momentous instant when the world can seem so small and a naive crush can feel all-consuming.

TWITTER Wes Andersons Cannes opening-night film is a highly idiosyncratic impeccably made portrait of young love. A blandly inexpressive title is the worst thing about Moonrise Kingdom a willfully eccentric pubescent love story in which even the most minute detail has been attended to in the manner of the most obsessive maker of 19th century dollhouses. PHOTOS Cannes 2012 Competition Lineup Features Cosmopolis Moonrise Kingdom Killing Them Softly Although it trades in such large matters as true love destiny child abandonment and a storm of historic proportions these issues are of no greater significance in the film than how two plaid fabrics look next to each other or the specific placement of a piece of Benjamin Britten music. In other words this is a Wes Anderson film -- more lightweight than some possessing a stronger emotional undertow than others -- that will strike the uninitiated as conspicuously arch. This Cannes Film Festival opening-night attraction and competition entry offers a raft of rarefied pleasures for the directors core fan base but the Focus Features offering has scant hope of breaking through to a wider public upon its May 25 U.S. release. During the opening sequence you could be forgiven for thinking you are looking at a dollhouse if not the underground lair of Mr. Fox and his family. In a series of quick lateral moves the frame shifts from room to room as in a slide show to reveal the home of the splintered Bishop family some members of which will figure prominently in whats to come. But the people pale in relation to the punctilious presentation which emphasizes decor and geographic and meteorological minutiae about New Penzance Island in New England as well as the strictly regimented routines of the Khaki Scouts whose 1965 summer session is under way. VIDEO Moonrise Kingdom Debuts Bill Murray Wes Anderson Bruce Willis and Edward Norton Clips Most of Andersons shots are head-on with a locked-down quality that makes them look like theyre ready for a frame. Even more than in his previous work the dialogue and music possess an extreme degree of declarative definitiveness that works as an aural correlative to the visuals. Everything is in a box -- a beautifully wrapped one at that -- allowing for no relaxation casualness or spontaneous combustion. Except combustion is what takes place between Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) a brainy orphan Scout and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) the odd girl out in a family with three preoccupied younger boys a checked-out dad (Bill Murray) and a mother (Frances McDormand) having an affair with a milquetoasty local cop Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). A general panic is sparked when Sam goes AWOL from Camp Ivanhoe to run away with Suzy. Cannes Qamp;A Wes Anderson on Making Moonrise Kingdom and His Cannes Debut On one level this is They Live by Night with 12-year-olds No one understands Suzy at home and Sam suddenly has been disowned by foster parents leaving him facing the severe ministrations of Social Services (Tilda Swinton) -- thats her name not a bureaucracy. But the tone could not be more different. These kids look at life and each other squarely and without blinking -- he through thick glasses she from behind perennially dramatic eye makeup. Not yet able to feel or express passion they rotely go through the motions of what they know theyre supposed to do -- briefly French kissing and touching certain key spots -- and acknowledge that they love each other. Mostly however they are pursued -- by her parents by the cop and his dog and most vigorously by the Scouts who purposefully mobilize in ways for which they are theoretically prepared but are rarely required to implement. The idea of the kids running off -- on an island no less -- is absurd of course; nothing can come of it. But there is something close to moving in the way they approach it with such openness and unity; even if they are emotionally and physically immature Suzy and Sam are as one mentally. As in Fantastic Mr. Fox Anderson is able to express sincere personal connection and compatibility while employing a highly artificial style. The result is that the core of Kingdom -- the bond between the leads played so forthrightly by newcomers Hayward and Gilman -- is strong even bracing in its resilience. Cannes Qamp;A Studiocanal CEO Olivier Courson on His Packed Market Lineup Favorite Festival Memory What takes place around them -- the inevitable pursuit by Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton) Scouts mobilizing as if for mortal combat frantic parents and local law enforcement chasing them around -- has jokey artificiality with a relatively modest amusement quotient. Most of the skilled adult actors dont have much to play Willis and McDormand at least have a relationship to sort out but Norton Murray Swinton and Harvey Keitel as another Scout Master seem way out on limbs of their own. But even in the most incidental scene there is always an arresting design quality to divert the eye such as the Scouts treetop quarters Captain Sharps beautiful old Spartanette trailer home or Social Services outrageously dramatic garb which looks like a combination of a Salvation Army uniform and an outfit Snow Whites Evil Queen would have coveted. At the 50-minute mark the errant couple is found which reverses the dynamic In the face of legal and family opposition how are Suzy and Sam going to be reunited? The preannounced deus ex machina plays a major role in this as do several changes of heart that occur during an increasingly frenzied final act that acquires the air of a miniature disaster movie. Amplifying the peculiar little story worked out by Anderson and Roman Coppola who also co-wrote The Darjeeling Limited with the director is a sense of style that extends to every nook and cranny of the film. Clearly this emanates from Anderson above all but he has chosen an array of collaborators no doubt stimulated by his exacting standards of artistry and detail including cinematographer Robert Yeoman on his sixth feature with Anderson; production designer Adam Stockhausen; costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone; and editor Andrew Weisblum. Alexandre Desplat composed the excellent score but his work is only a component of an extraordinarily complex soundtrack. Music by Britten is dominant particularly from Noyes Fludde (Noahs Flood) a work by the English composer first performed in 1958 that could have been appropriated by Anderson for use in this watery context or more likely served as inspiration for the inundation that climaxes the film. The way Britten is joined on the track by a mix of Saint-Saens Mozart Schubert Hank Williams and Desplat is remarkable and deserving of an essay of its own.
