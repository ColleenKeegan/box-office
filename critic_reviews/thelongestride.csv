Entertainment ""The Longest Ride"" Has Figured Out A New Way To Be Old-Fashioned Nicholas Sparks latest does all the usual Sparks-y things with one nifty casting trick. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Scott Eastwood and Britt Robertson in The Longest Ride. Michael Tackett/Twentieth Century Fox ID 5431147 Nicholas Sparks movies sell the idea of being old-fashioned and they sell it consistently and well. The Sparks oeuvre is now 10 movies strong and counting with number 11 The Choice done shooting and set for a release next year. And the fact that they pretty much all hew to the same formula with marked dedication has become a selling point. It doesnt matter that their casts are generally led by the latest in buzzed-about beautiful faces -- The Longest Ride which is directed by George Tillman Jr. and opens April 10 stars Scott Eastwood and Britt Robertson. Or that their settings are contemporary ones in which everyone wears jeans all the time carries a cell phone and has no qualms about indulging in a little soft-focus sex when the moment is right. They deliver a very specific kind of hit harkening back to a gentler more civilized era that never really existed but that makes for a very cozy place to visit on screen. Its an era in which the men are strong but tenderhearted and committed the women radiant but wary needing to be wooed in some swoony fashion that hopefully involves kissing in the rain or in a shower. When Luke Collins (Eastwood) picks Sophia Danko (Robertson) up to take her out on their first date in The Longest Ride he strides through her college campus and up to the front door of her sorority house wielding a bouquet of flowers. Hes a cowboy a professional bull rider on the PBR circuit but in that scene he looks like he might as well be a time traveler visiting from another time and place. ID 5435490 View this image > Britt Robertson and Scott Eastwood. Michael Tackett / Twentieth Century Fox ID 5446272 The Longest Ride is a weak sauce addition to the Sparks empire a little better than last years The Best of Me but miles below uber-Sparks work The Notebook. But the otherwise wan The Longest Ride has one thing that sets it apart a quirk of casting the children and grandchildren of Hollywood icons. Scott Eastwood the son of Clint Eastwood and the primary product The Longest Ride is pushing in whats his biggest role to date. Hes not a terribly charismatic performer though the movies less concerned with his acting ability and more interested in the wattage of his smile and how he takes off his shirt something he handles with aplomb. But he does look strikingly fascinatingly like his dad as filtered through the more contemporary screen hunkiness of the Chrises Evans and Hemsworth. Its impossible to shake -- hes prettier and softer but cant help but recall some of the famous screen cowboys the older Eastwoods played every time he appears on screen especially when in his one moment of sharpness his character tells an art dealer of her show ""I think theres more bullshit here than where I work."" ID 5445076 Scott Eastwood Michael Tackett / Twentieth Century Fox Oona Chaplin and Jack Huston Michael Tackett / Twentieth Century Fox ID 5445733 Eastwood adds to the movies Sparksian temporal fuzziness and sense of remove one thats fueled by the way it looks unfailingly like a North Carolina tourism board commercial in which the sunlights always as buttery as a croissant unless an emotional or sultry moment would look better in the rain. Theres the picturesqueness of a idealized memory that never ends in Sparks adaptations compounded by the frequent use of flashbacks. The Longest Ride flashbacks actually are idealized memories a polished-into-generic vision of the 1940s 50s and 60s as recounted by the storys doler-out of wisdom Ira Levinson (Alan Alda). Boardwalk Empire alum Jack Huston grandson of legendary filmmaker and actor John Huston and Game of Thrones alum Oona Chaplin granddaughter of Charlie Chaplin play the younger version of Aldas character and that of his late wife respectively as they fall in love and overcome hardships during and after World War II. Huston and Chaplin may not provoke the same immediate recognition that Scott Eastwoods not-quite-famous mug does but theyre the descendants of two venerable Hollywood dynasties and they bring some ballast and quirk to a overstuffed backstory that incorporates the Jewish community theyre a part of war injuries and the Black Mountain College. The two even steal the focus from golden couple Eastwood and Robertson who -- in the present -- have far less weighty drama to deal with as they fight over whether Luke will continue in his bull-riding career despite a life-threatening injury. As the Levinsons struggle over whether their marriage can survive infertility given their desire in the wake of the Holocaust to have a large family Luke and Sophias problems start to seriously pale in comparison. When your present-day stakes involve whether or not to take an internship in New York its hard to fault the movie for tipping toward the past.

"The Longest Ride - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire The Longest Ride Posted by Christy Lemire on April 11 2015 8 Comments 20th Century Fox Rated PG-13 for some sexuality partial nudity and some war and sports action. Running time 128 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four. Movies based on Nicholas Sparks novels are low-hanging fruit. With their patented formula of painfully earnest romance and melodrama they are easy to chew up and spit out. They exist in a glistening parallel universe where the impossible isnt just possible but expected. They are a genre unto themselves. But Despite the urge to tool on them sometimes they do exactly what they need to do to please their target audience. ""The Notebook"" is of course the gold standard. ""Safe Haven"" was entertaining enough for its gorgeous leads (Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough) and its batshit-crazy twist. But ""The Longest Ride"" is pretty darn tolerable -- and sometimes even enjoyable -- not just for fans but also for regular people who are you know cynical. Director George Tillman Jr. (""Notorious"" ""Faster"") might not seem like the obvious choice for a Sparks movie but he brings some artistry and energy to these gooey overlong proceedings while maintaining the elements weve come to expect. (Craig Bolotin wrote the script.) They include any or all of the following kissing in the rain magical old people generation-spanning romance cancer death the North Carolina coast a box full of important stuff letters that explain everything and a climactic shocker that changes whatever youve just seen. ""The Longest Ride"" the 10th Sparks novel to make it to the screen is extremely Sparksian but also quite agreeable thanks to the easy chemistry of its attractive leads. Scott Eastwood stars as a hunky professional bull rider named Luke Collins. In his first major film role Eastwood bears an eerie physical resemblance to his dad Clint back in his ""Rawhide"" days -- the eyes the smile and the slightly raspy voice but also the magnetic screen presence. He acquits himself just fine here; like the film as a whole Eastwood does exactly what he needs to do which includes frequently appearing shirtless. But Im gonna go ahead and play devils advocate and say this is relevant to reveal the serious scars hes acquired from years of participating in such a dangerous sport and not just shameless eye candy. Perky blonde Britt Robertson co-stars as Sophia Danko a senior art history major at Wake Forest University whose sorority sisters drag her to a rodeo one afternoon. (Melissa Benoist who had such a natural presence as Miles Tellers brief love interest in ""Whiplash"" goes underused as her best friend.) There Sophia meets cute with the scruffy sweaty Luke; afterward the two flirt outside a honky tonk while their friends drunkenly line dance inside. But Sophia is reluctant to launch into a new romance since shes leaving in two months for an internship at a New York City art gallery. Still she cant resist Lukes old-fashioned cowboy charms which include picking her up at the sorority house in tight jeans and a hat with a handful of flowers then driving her in his pickup truck to a lakeside barbecue picnic by lantern light. Seriously this guy is too good to be true -- which extends to his heroism when he notices on the way home that a car has gone through a railing on a winding rain-soaked road. Luke pulls the driver out while Sophia retrieves the crucial box of historical items which will provide the backbone of the films era-spanning structure. Turns out the gentleman is Ira Levinson a World War II veteran with plenty of stories to tell -- all of which hes conveniently already put down in writing in the form of love letters to his dear departed wife Ruth. Alan Alda brings gravitas wisdom and wry sly humor to the role simply by showing up and being Alan Alda. His presence alone makes the improbable friendship that develops between Ira and Sophia almost believable. Sophia returns to his hospital room day after day and gives him the strength to recover by reading his letters out loud to him -- only the narration comes from Ira himself and it seems that hes written these letters to Ruth to recap important events in their lives mere moments after theyve occurred. Its as if he got into the car after a big date pulled out some stationery and started scribbling away in the front seat. Very confusing -- and contrived. However the letters provide a window into the thrilling romance he enjoyed in the 1940s as a young man (played by Jack Huston grandson of John) with the young Ruth (Oona Chaplin granddaughter of Charlie -- this is a seriously pedigreed picture). Cosmically the flashbacks reveal stages and struggles in their decades-old relationship which mirror what Luke and Sophia are experiencing now. And theyre far more engaging than the story that takes place in the present day with far greater stakes. Ira was a small-town North Carolina boy. He quickly fell for Ruth whod fled with her Austrian Jewish family just before the war and awkwardly tried to chat her up at temple. (""The Longest Ride"" is like all Sparks fare super white but at least the religious diversity is refreshing.) Like Sophia Ruth was an art lover with an impeccable eye for the mid-century abstract expressionist masters Pollock Rothko de Kooning. (Its a connection which obviously will become relevant later which is not the slightest bit of a spoiler.) Chaplin is radiant as the vibrant sophisticated Ruth and she has a lovely chemistry with Huston whose timeless good looks make him a great fit for this kind of period drama. If only the entire film could have been about them -- but alas we have to return to the modern-day story where Luke and Sophia frolic on horseback before frolicking in the shower. The leering is all very tastefully lighted. But the forced conflict which keeps them apart is rather flimsy and obviously navigable. Will Luke give up the life of a bull rider before it kills him? Will Sophia figure out a way to sell overpriced art while still attending to the needs of her heart? You dont need to have seen a single Sparks movie before -- or any movie for that matter -- to figure out the answer to those questions.

"Let There Be Light Juliette Binoche Is Luminous; Ex Machina Lacks Life. Plus Hallelujah You Can Survive The Longest Ride << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Let There Be Light Juliette Binoche Is Luminous; Ex Machina Lacks Life. Plus Hallelujah You Can Survive The Longest Ride IFC Movies April 10 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Clouds of Sils Maria makes you believe that a world-famous actress played by Juliette Binoche once did time as a villain in the X-Men movies. Not just any villain either but one who sounds like Doctor Nemesis a lean gentleman in a fedora who in every way is Binoches opposite. The movie makes you believe that Kristen Stewart playing the actresss assistant is Binoches equal as a performer and that shes perceptive and wise while Binoche is flighty and self-consumed. Their tandem is as much as you could ask for from acting that is subtle but not too subtle. Binoche and Stewart spend most of the movie in a two-way conversation and each woman seems to bring out something new in the other. That Stewart can keep up with Binoche is impressive but that she can think alongside her is exciting. The movie which Olivier Assayas wrote and directed is a world of wonders most of them cerebrally twisty and emotionally hallucinogenic. Hes thinking about youthfulness and age and self-reflection. The title refers to a rare sort of cloud that snakes through the valleys of the Swiss Alps portending rocky weather. The druggy way that cloud is presented here slithering toward the camera engulfing another character until shes sick is like a ghostly exhalation of something brewed in a bong. Here the turbulence is psychological. Binoches character Maria Enders is on her way to present an old Swiss playwright friend Wilhelm Melchior with a literary prize. On the train to Zurich her assistant Valentine (or Val) gets a call telling her the friend has died. The timing is strange since Maria has just been invited to join a revival of Maloja Snake a play by Melchior about a younger woman named Sigrid who fills her older boss Helena with suicidal lust. It seems like a terrible show. But as a younger actress Maria had made an artistic breakthrough playing Sigrid. Now shes reluctantly going to play Helena. In any case the role would be a creative risk. Shes had enough of acting with wires as she puts it but has reservations about acting without nets too. Returning to this play opposite the role that made her reputation means accepting that shes no longer an ingenue. That sounds like tired old actorly vanity Am I too old? And the situation raises some cinematic concerns Is this too Bergman? But it feels as if Assayass movie wants to rethink Bergmans X-rays of toxic intimacy in order to put Maria in battle with herself. The movie compounds her sense of vulnerability. Shes in the middle of a divorce. Her grabby old costar (Hanns Zischler) is back on the scene. And the actress playing her old role is a popular young American hothead named Jo-Ann (Chloe Grace Moretz having a sneering blast) who also comes to this play hot off a superhero movie. Maria gives in to the temptation to Google her. She and Val find bratty Jo-Ann press conferences naughty talk-show appearances and an amusingly inane clip from one of the comic-book films. (One thing Assayas cant make you believe is that the hottest young actress on the planet is named Jo-Ann.) Running the plays lines with Val who does Sigrid provides confusion where clarity is presumed. They hole up in an Alpine bungalow and go over the scenes unpacking meaning. All Maria does is defend the plays essence but even for her its unfixed. Val cant understand why Maria wont simply accept what shes become older. This is vertiginously European and yet Assayas doesnt overdress it in formalism. If he had shot this like a Bergman movie with the conjoined-twin blocking and the suffocating and uninflected sharing of frames Sils Maria would be unbearable. Itd be karaoke. Instead Assayas plants the claustrophobia in Marias head. For the line-running scenes Maria gets a rather amazing haircut that doubly corresponds to masculinized femininity and Peter Pan delusions. Indeed contrary to her misgivings about the phoniness of superhero movies she flies around the house and the backyard like a woman happily acquainted with wires. The text of the play brings out the subtext of Maria and Vals relationship which carries a current of attraction. They debate the meaning of it all until they reach a credible intellectual impasse Val doesnt feel that Maria respects her reading. Maybe Maria doesnt. Shes too caught up in her neuroses to value a second opinion. How can such a bad play -- one that loosely sounds like the plot for 2010s Love Crime a lousy psychosexual thriller with Kristin Scott Thomas and Ludivine Sagnier -- bring out such smart screenwriting and instinctive acting? It turns out that as characters and actors Binoche and Stewart are unexpectedly ideal scene partners. Binoche is the sort of star who can find harmony with almost anyone in any language. Shes luminous in everything -- but shes the only star Ive ever seen who can so specifically adjust the wattage. For Flight of the Red Balloon she was luminously unstable. For Certified Copy she was luminously romantic. For Assayas she turns herself inside out so completely so contradictorily (and yes so luminously) that you wonder whether Binoche herself is looking for the same answers as Maria. Shes weary vital angry warm exhilarated engaged and aloof. I think that brightness blinds people to the brilliance of her actual talent. Light upstaging light Most actors should be so lucky. Whats surprising about the combination of her and Stewart is how much the older woman (Binoche is 51) appears to enjoy working with the younger one (Stewart is 25) -- not maternally either. That could just be acting but it seems like more than professionalism. Its transference. Binoche makes Stewart appear to be her equal. And after seeing them act together here you leave thinking maybe she is. For a while it seemed as if she were going to try to get by in every performance on sulky attitude (thats what Moretz does; here it happens to work). But even in a couple of those Twilight movies -- the first and fourth -- Stewart has Jennifer Jason Leighs ballsiness. It doesnt seem like shes faking her way through a movie anymore. Shes building performances in smart ways -- by observation and collaboration. Being good seems to interest her more than being a star. Stewart sneaks through the back door for every line delivery. Theres a womanly husk in her voice. When she speaks its with some jadedness and a bit of warmth. She has a way of communicating that shes hearing the other person in the scene. That skill for listening is what made her so good as Julianne Moores daughter in Still Alice though here the effect is different. Val and Maria are acting partners and theorists arguing for their respective understanding of the text. When Val tells Maria that theater is an ""interpretation of life that can be truer than life itself"" Stewart has to say it the way certain 24-year-olds would. She makes it sound neither unduly wise nor highfalutin -- just according to her true. Clouds of Sils Maria is Assayass latest personal entertainment-industry salvo (Irma Vep from 1997 and Demonlover from 2002 are two others). This one has the right harmony among the different worlds and texts (context subtext pretext text-text) so that it works not only as a movie but also as a running commentary on itself. It opens itself up for different readings. (Ive heard more than one person suggest that Val is a figment.) As a filmmaker hes too catholic in his interests to have a single preoccupation. But thematic ambition and lack of interest in narrative convention characterize nearly all of his narrative features. (The 2010 miniseries terrorism epic Carlos might be the best-known project.) Clouds of Sils Maria is another movie that presents artistic integrity as a matter of life and death. Like Birdman it stages that presentation as a confrontation between the mass commerce of superhero movies and the allegedly naked truth of the stage. Assayass movie is an elegant counterpoint to that movies caffeinated insecurities and macho poetry. You dread seeing the play in either movie. But Birdman cops out on it anyway. It becomes an ephemeral plea for a last stroke of the ego. Assayas uses it to take stock of a womans soul. For him the plays always the thing.  Universal Pictures The opening scenes of Ex Machina give you what you want from a movie They hypnotize. In a perfectly edited series of dreamlike images a software programmer named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) discovers that hes won a contest that gets him loaded onto a helicopter and dropped into the middle of a remote hunk of verdant lushness where a cottage of enviable high design (glass concrete glass marble etc.) has been tucked into the landscape. The owner of the house is a billionaire technologist named Nathan (Oscar Isaac) who owns the company Caleb works for. He takes Caleb down into the vast basement which is part bunker part boutique hotel part lab and which is plagued with unexplained power outages. We dont know whats going on. Neither does Caleb really. Nathan has him sign a nondisclosure agreement and the security card he gives his employee unlocks only some of the doors. The apprehension persists after Nathan presents his experiment to Caleb. Its an application of the Turing test in which Caleb is to determine whether the behavior of the robot that Nathan has devised -- a shapely figure called Ava -- is distinguishable from a human. At first the reason to go along with this is that the writer and director Alex Garland keeps the movie so full of doomy atmosphere that expecting the worst sort of becomes a treat. But gradually the hypnosis wears off the mystique dissipates and banalities take over. Nathan has a creepy-sexy housekeeper named Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) for instance and you can tell somethings up with her when Nathan berates her for breaking a dish or some glasses and she somehow fails to stab him in the neck with a shard. Garland is the novelist turned screenwriter of Danny Boyles very good science fiction movies (28 Days Later ...  Sunshine). This is his first film as a director. After a while you realize that he has relied entirely on mortifying atmosphere to get him through. The red hell lighting that crops up makes you feel like youre at one of the parties in Rosemarys Baby. Meanwhile something on Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrows effective electronic soundtrack is nearly always throbbing. You dont know whether to climb the walls or phone a cardiologist. Garland also adapted Kazuo Ishiguros novel about the inner lives of clones Never Let Me Go into a sleepy movie that thought the book was about their outer lives. Gleeson and Alicia Vikander who plays Ava pick up where the actors in that movie left off. In fairness Vikander doesnt have much of a choice. But for a creature thats passing the Turing test with flying colors her hints at sentient humanness cry out for their own Turing experiment. The performances stiffen further as a horror movie pools around them. Isaac is wonderful though. He has the beard that Robert De Niro used to play Satan in Angel Heart and the swagger that Al Pacino probably uses to load the dishwasher. Hes permitted to work with abandon here. The best scene in the movie has him and Mizuno disco dancing in sync to Oliver Cheathams ""Get Down Saturday Night"" a song that deserves to replace ""Got to Give It Up"" as the movies atmospheric party jam. Isaac is actually too wonderful. His whatever-dude insouciance takes the menace out of the movie. Garland needs the noise and lights to keep you on edge because his villain has too much creative leeway. His evil sleaziness never reaches full-on psychotic. But maybe Isaac was looking for a way out of a cliche. I for one am always disappointed when all that movie nerds can think to do with their genius their god complex and their Gs is to take a rib and build an Ava. (Or a Kyoko -- walking talking Fleshlights.) Based on the heartless territory the movie stakes out Garland too might be tired of this. But 90 minutes of male fantasy and 10 of alleged feminism are bad math. Ex Machina feels like the work of someone who felt the best way to make Frankenstein was to watch a lot of porn.  Twentieth Century Fox Clouds of Sils Maria and Ex Machina are either entirely or partially contingent upon art. So is The Longest Ride which is not at all about the Tour de France. Its based on a Nicholas Sparks novel in which a North Carolina cowboy has to consider giving up the rodeo because his aspiring-gallerist girlfriend (and his physician) thinks its bad for his health. Also because some sentimental old Jewish guy kind of says so. The movie lasts for more than two hours. Its full of bunk and even more full of flashbacks. The young lovers are anonymous-looking -- shes a perky blonde; he squints -- but theyre still likable. The painter Willem de Kooning makes a special appearance while the unridable bull Rango makes several (playing himself). I like the campy judgments of these Sparks movies. Theyre like having a reverend do a puppet show to explain sin. This one has that. But its got a sexiness that rarely comes through in these movies. Britt Robertson plays the girl Sophia. Scott Eastwood plays the guy Luke. (Eastwood is Clints son so the squinting comes honestly.) And when he kisses her -- well he evidently knows how. At the movies that is a Halleys Comet-level event. Eastwood seems like he was raised by surfers not farmers but whats the point in arguing? When he trudges past in a cowboy hat and boots plaid shirt tucked into jeans and flowers in his hands people stare like hes also a centaur. The plot wouldnt pass a safety inspection. Luke and Sophia rescue a man named Ira (Alan Alda) and his letters from the car he crashed on the side of a road. They take him to the hospital and for reasons that are inadequately explained his vision is bad and Sophia winds up reading him the letters which he wrote. This means the movie has to go all the way back to the 1940s and inch its way toward the 21st century. For long passages we watch young Ira (Jack Huston) woo Ruth (Oona Chaplin) then marry her then fail to give her children (thanks WWII battle injury). As a schoolteacher shes beatific about it until she can no longer keep her maternity on standby. He lavishes her with art -- De Koonings Ellsworth Kellys and a Jacob Lawrence -- and she loves him for it. But that impoverished parentless kid in her class is starting to look like a pretty good addition to the collection. Why conventional adoption fails for these nice rich people is also conveniently underexplained. If the reason is anti-Semitism speak The blandness afoot is a change of pace for the director George Tillman Jr. whose other movies include Soul Food and the Biggie Smalls biopic Notorious. (He also produced Barbershop Beauty Shop and Roll Bounce.) This is to say that theres a heartbreaking honesty in Lukes decision to serve Sophia barbecue from plastic bags and Styrofoam Why pretend? The plot switches back and forth until everything else is made clear enough for a series of surprises that almost choked me up. Luke learns that theres more to life than staying on a bull at a rodeo. By ""more"" I mean Sophia who has learned everything before the movie starts which is how she has so much time for Luke. The Longest Ride has as much bull as the 10 previous Sparks adaptations.

"Longest Ride The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; longest-ride-the ) Longest Ride The (United States 2015) April 08 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli As a romance a drama or even a sports movie The Longest Ride never reaches a satisfying destination. With its confused sometimes-contradictory themes and scattershot love story aspirations the film never gains traction on the shifting sands of its premise and fails to achieve even the less-than-lofty pinnacle of sudsy melodrama. The thinly-drawn characters sit at the nexus of the problem but they arent helped by liberal doses of bad dialogue wooden acting and pointless narrative progression. The Longest Ride is a bore and because the filmmakers for some reason believed it necessary to stretch this out for more than two hours a prolonged one. Like most movies based on Nicholas Sparks novels this one is about people meeting falling in love then encountering  difficulties in the relationship. Sparks deals in cliches which isnt unusual for the genre but his books work primarily because no matter how familiar the brush strokes may be the characters are vividly depicted. The movies have varied from insipid (Night in Rodanthe) to affecting (The Notebook Message in a Bottle). The Longest Ride is among the worst primarily because it leaves anything compelling behind on the written page. What makes it to the screen struggles to work on even the most basic level. Not content to present just one love story The Longest Ride offers two of them - one set in contemporary times and the other in the 1940s (with the latter unfolding as present-day characters read a series of old letters - a device that works infinitely better in a book than on-screen). The movie gets an injection of ""sports movie"" adrenaline (presumably to offset the sleep-inducing impact of the other elements) by having bull rider Luke Collins (all-around hunk Scott ""Son of Clint"" Eastwood) pursue a comeback after a horrific injury. Along the way he falls in love with art student Sophia Danko (TV actress Britt Robertson). They ""meet cute"" make goo-goo eyes at one another and have PG-13 sex. But theyre from different worlds - he loves the country and ranches she loves New York and galleries. Were headed into Green Acres territory until the guy from M.A.S.H. shows up. Alan Alda plays Ira Levinson who is introduced when Luke and Sophia save his life after he crashes his car. Luckily for the movie which clocks in at about an hour when focused on the Luke/Sophia romance Ira wrote a lot of letters during the 1940s when he (played in the flashbacks by Jack Huston) and his eventual wife Ruth (Oona ""Granddaughter of Charlie"" Chaplin) ""meet cute"" makes goo-goo eyes at one another and have PG-13 sex. To further pad out the length we get a WWII battle scene (which looks like WWI trench warfare) and an aftermath that suggests true love can cure PTSD. The idea is that were supposed to care equally deeply about the Luke/Sophia and Ira/Ruth pairings. The reality is that by crisscrossing back and forth through time with characters that have no tangible connection to each other the film undercuts our ability to care about the marginally better developed modern couple. Ira and Ruth never come to life. Their scenes feel like filler the actors share no chemistry and the narration is awkward. (Who writes letters reminding a loved one in detail of how they first met?)  and Sophia are left skirting the 1940s segments trying to work out their problems.  Theres just not enough screen time for them to develop beyond the level of a generic screen couple. Theres an anachronistic aspect to The Longest Ride that makes its box office viability questionable. Certainly Nicholas Sparks involvement guarantees a certain level of success but with the target demographic of young women increasingly drawn to more racy material like 50 Shades of Grey can a ""soft"" PG-13 romance survive? This isnt even a good PG-13 romance; its long confused and doesnt tug effectively on the heartstrings. It evokes the theme of sacrificing for love only to betray that theme at the end. To say this long ride is bumpy would be to understate how uncomfortably tedious the trip is.

Though characters never overlap they might as well all exist in a shared universe -- one with its own logic its own attitudes and its own idea of fan service. The relationships are interchangeable and easy-to-assemble Sometimes its the boy whos got the chip on his shoulder sometimes its the girl; sometimes class gets in the way sometimes war sometimes differing worldviews. Love always wins out naturally but often it does so ironically; Sparks is not one to shy away from killing off a lover or two which occasionally gives the stories some much-needed suspense. Seen in that light The Longest Ride is actually one of the more competent Sparks films in some years -- a far cry from the creaky noir of Safe Haven the awkwardly backloaded melodrama of The Best of Me or the phony brooding of The Lucky One. It goes down smoothly if blandly like an air-flavored milkshake. The present-day romance involves hotshot bull-rider Luke Collins (Scott Eastwood who looks like the secret love-child of his dad Clint and Zac Efron) attempting to mount a comeback one year after a harrowing accident that nearly ended his life; and Sophia Danko (Britt Robertson who looks like Jennifer Lawrences less quirky cousin) an art major from New Jersey who tags along one day to the rodeo with her sorority sisters sees Luke ride picks up his hat and catches his eye. They come from different worlds and are headed in different directions Shes headed to an internship in New York and hes determined to go to the championships in Las Vegas. The films most charming scene has him arriving for their first date in full cowboy regalia clutching a bouquet raising eyebrows as he walks through campus asking for directions. But wait -- theres a second couple this time. One night Luke and Sophia come across a car wreck and find Ira (Alan Alda) an elderly man whos had a heart attack while driving. Beside him is a box of old letters. At the hospital as Ira recovers Sophia reads to him from the letters which date back many decades. They tell the story of Iras romance with Ruth a feisty Jewish refugee from Austria during World War II. Young Ira is played by Jack Huston grandson of John; young Ruth is played by Oona Chaplin granddaughter of Charlie. One can sense the royal Hollywood blood coursing through these actors veins; they own the screen. Ira cant seem to take his eyes off of Ruth even as he trembles and freezes in her presence; she for her part is driven outspoken passionate and leads him along marvelously. As written the dynamic between them is dopey and one-dimensional but these two remarkable actors give it life. Theres a most Sparks-ian lesson to be learned here of course about romantic sacrifice. The story of Ruth and Ira and what they had to give up to find happiness (I wont give it away here) predictably has some bearing on Luke and Sophias relationship. But as often happens in Sparks movies the films most emotional moment has little to do with the romance and more to do with a seemingly extraneous character. In Dear John the waterworks came when Channing Tatum held his dying autistic father (Richard Jenkins) in his arms; in Nights in Rodanthe they came when troubled surgeon Richard Gere learned more about the life of a woman who died on his operating table. Here it has to do with Ruths attempts to instill a love of learning and art in a desperately poor hillbilly boy. No really Look its easy to laugh at this stuff -- thats part of the game in fact. To buy into these movies you have to buy into the silliness. But The Longest Ride for all its ridiculousness comes by its emotions honestly. Director George Tillman Jr. a journeyman whos done everything from Soul Food to Notorious to Men of Honor is not afraid to pull back on the swooning and just let the characters get to know each other. (At one point Sophia and Luke discuss their different backgrounds; she talks about being the child of Polish immigrants about bringing ""stinky snacks to school"" and he talks about how everybody he grew up around was the same.) This is no minor feat. These types of movies often get their mileage by turning up the heat and its rare to find one with this much assured patience. Eastwood and Robertson seem at ease around each other too which helps -- when theyre not being blown off the screen by Huston and Chaplin that is. The Longest Ride may not be a particularly good movie but enough craft and care have clearly been brought to it that those looking for a Nicholas Sparks fix could do a lot worse.

Which sort of makes sense as it comes from a slick push-all-the-buttons professional bull writer. Thats not to minimize Nicholas Sparks commercial achievements. He has plenty of best-sellers 10 of which have been turned into movies. One or two of those - ""The Notebook"" and ""Nights in Rodanthe"" - even provided guiltless good cries. But the storytelling has gotten mechanical; its all prefab fiction assembled from a small box of interchangeable parts. Take one straight-arrow guy and one independent gal. Have them meet cute in North Carolina. Add at least three rainstorms of different types (sexy/dangerous/sad). Insert a frisky love scene (shared showers are good) some red-white-and-blue Americana and a tear-jerking tragedy (illness preferred). Then slap on a title and off you go. ""The Longest Ride"" though feels slapped together more than most - tediously plotted and desperately lacking star charisma. Sparks stories need all the help they can get and in the past theyve gotten it from actors like Ryan Gosling Rachel McAdams and Richard Gere. Here they have Scott Eastwood and Britt Robertson. Robertson who is so relentlessly pert and squeaky she could be a morning-show anchor is actually from the Carolinas - so of course the movie has her play a Polish girl from Rutherford gone south to study art. Eastwood is the professional rodeo competitor she falls for. Until he starts falling regularly jeopardizing his health - and their budding relationship. Eastwood is yes old Clints son and he has his fathers sexy squint and low body fat but thats about it. Hes also part of this movies odd trivia-question-in-the-making three of the other actors - Jack Huston Oona Chaplin and even Alan Alda - are celebrity offspring too. Sometimes though talent skips a generation although even the very best actors couldnt do much with this script which has Robertson and Eastwood - on their first date - pulling cranky codger Alda out of a burning car along with a box of letters. Theyre ancient love letters it seems. And yes while Alda convalesces Robertson is going to read him every one out loud - while we get ""The Notebook"" style flashbacks to the 40s with Huston and Chaplin navigating the ups and downs of a relationship and teaching us all a lesson. You see you might think the eight seconds a champion cowboy spends on the back of a bucking bull is a lifetime of excitement. But the decades you spend building a relationship? (Significant pause here.) Thats really the longest ride. Well fine go stick it on a greeting card but the truth is this movie is really the longest sit. Theres nothing very exciting about Eastwoods rodeo competitions and Robertsons big dilemma - do I go to New York for a job or stay here with my boyfriend? - isnt much of dilemma at all. The movie has nowhere to go and spends more than two hours getting there. There are some pretty pictures of North Carolina. There are also some interesting pictures by modern artists (including Robert De Niros late father which may bring the actor a rare smile). But the only way to stay awake during this is to count how many times the movie manages to get in a plug for Pabst Blue Ribbon. And the only way to enjoy it would be to have your own Pabst Blue Ribbon every time. Ratings note The film contains brief nudity sexual situations alcohol abuse and strong language. The Longest Ride (PG-13) Fox (139 min.) Directed by George Tillman Jr. With Scott Eastwood Britt Robertson.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Michael Tackett) By Stephanie Merry April 9 2015 Follow stephmerry If youve seen one film adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel youve seen them all. So whats left to say about the latest overwrought romance based on one of his books ""The Longest Ride""? Those who saw ""The Notebook"" ""The Best of Me"" or ""Nights in Rodanthe"" might find his latest directed by George Tillman Jr. extremely familiar with a couple small tweaks Bull-riding and Judaism are involved. The movie jumps back and forth in time following two love stories as they unfold simultaneously yet decades apart. In the modern day the pairing involves Luke Collins (Scott Eastwood son of Clint) and Sophia Danko (Britt Robertson). Hes a competitive bull rider looking to buck his way back to the top after a serious accident sidelined him for a year. He was thrown from a particularly bad beast Rango and one lingering look at the bull leaves no doubt that foreshadowing is at work; there will be a rematch. Sophia meanwhile is soon to graduate from Wake Forest with plans to move to New York City and intern at a gallery. One night she gets cajoled by a sorority sister into going to her first rodeo and she enjoys it more than she expects especially when young Luke shows off his skills for mounting an enraged bull and hanging on for dear life. [Are you watching a Nicholas Sparks movie? This guide can help.] One chance encounter with a dropped cowboy hat and the two are embarking on their first date which in turn leads them to the scene of a car wreck. Luke and Sophia end up saving the life of the elderly man behind the wheel Ira (Alan Alda). Hes a curmudgeon with a heart of gold and of course a great love story to tell -- through faded old letters no less. In flashbacks we see Ira as a shy young man (played by Jack Huston nephew of Angelica) falling in love with the effervescent Ruth (Oona Chaplin granddaughter of Charlie -- do you notice a theme here?). Shes an Austrian Jew whose family fled the Nazis and relocated to Iras hometown. Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks ""The Longest Ride"" tells the story of a bull champion (Scott Eastwood) and a college student (Britt Robertson) whose love is threatened by their conflicting paths and beliefs. (20th Century Fox) True to form Sparkss intertwining stories involve impossibly beautiful people and the seemingly insurmountable obstacles to their happily ever after. Sophia and Lukes fledgling relationship is endangered by her relocation and his passion for a life-threatening sport. And then theres Ruth who desperately wants a bushel of children. But Ira injured during World War II cant provide. The moral of the story True love requires sacrifice kids. The cinematic path to this nugget of wisdom is mostly forgettable. Is it the bad dialogue or the poor editing that creates such a lack of chemistry between Luke and Sophia? Or is subpar acting part of it too? Its hard to tell. Eastwood doesnt prove himself to be much more than a pretty face and a chiseled body; but to be fair it would be hard for any actor to pull off some of these lines. For example when Luke asks Sophia if she and her sorority sisters have pillow fights in their underwear (ugh) she responds ""No we dont wear underwear."" Witty banter this is not. The older tale is more enjoyable (and theres thankfully no room for sorority jokes). Chaplin especially conjures up a winning character in Ruth a teacher with a childlike enthusiasm for art and life. Its during this thread that the movie hits its most emotional notes although the heavy-handed score practically screams ""You can start sobbing now."" People dont go to Sparks movies for subtlety; they go to warm their hearts by bearing witness to true love. Of course that requires a story that rings true. In ""The Longest Ride"" authenticity is in short supply. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains some sexuality partial nudity and some war and sports action. 128 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 10 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 10 2015 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by George Tillman Jr. Written by Craig Bolotin Starring Britt Robertson Scott Eastwood Alan Alda and Jack Huston Country USA Language English Eventful polished and knuckle-bitingly dull the 10th film adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks combines fate bull riding and some powerful Hollywood bloodlines among its young cast. In sun-dappled North Carolina a studly bull rider Luke (Scott ""son of Clint"" Eastwood) falls in love with cute Wake Forest art major Sophia (Britt Robertson) who will soon leave for a coveted intern job in New York. Fortunately an aged car accident casualty Ira (Alan Alda) gets Sophie to read some of his diary-like love letters to his late wife Ruth which triggers a parallel story set in the 1940s. Jack Huston (grandson of John) plays the gawky young Ira with a vibrant Oona Chaplin (granddaughter of Charlie) as his cultured Austrian-Jewish immigrant wife Ruth. Their story is intended as an example to the young folk of how love requires sacrifice though the movies ridiculous ending also allows for lucrative miracles.

The film is based on a Nicholas Sparks novel so yes - crying is involved. Youll be whimpering when the movie crawls across the two hour mark with no end in sight. Set in North Carolina The Longest Ride tells two love stories simultaneously. The first story stars hunk-du-jour Scott Eastwood as Luke a professional bull rider and Britt Robertson as Sophia a bright art history student studying at Wake Forest University. They meet when her sorority sisters drag her out to a bull riding event. Its love at first sight but there are complications. Luke and Sophia rescue an elderly gentleman named Ira (Alan Alda) from a car accident and that kicks off the second love story. Through old love letters we learn that Ira and his wife Ruth (played in glossy 1940s flashback by Jack Huston and Oona Chaplin) are madly in love but must suffer the heartbreak of being childless. Ruth is very interested in contemporary art so they buy lots of paintings but always in the background is their sorrow over having no kids. Mobile users click this link But Ira and Ruth soldier on their love story of the past offering lessons to Luke and Sophia in the present. Love requires sacrifice Ira tells Sophia when she visits him in the hospital. Apparently love also requires lingering close-ups oddly heatless sex scenes between Luke and Sophia plenty of soft focus and a glacial pace throughout; its like nothing ever happens to Luke and Sophia and even the dangerous bull riding Luke undertakes just seems too stupid to contemplate. Ira and Ruth on the other hand have a busy story to tell and every detail is laid out in visual cliche after visual cliche. Guess things were different in the olden days. Meanwhile back at the ranch conflict arises (finally) over Lukes bull riding. Hes already been seriously injured in the sport but feels compelled to continue. He wants to be the best and he wants to earn the money necessary to keep his mom (Lolita Davidovich) on the family farm. But both mom and Sophia want Luke to quit. On her side Sophia is set to graduate and move to New York where she has an important internship at an art gallery. But shes willing to give all that up if only Luke will stop endangering his life with bucking bulls. Because who doesnt want to sacrifice everything to live in the middle of nowhere with a bucking guy whos already fallen on his bucking head once too often but looks so nice with his shirt off? You will have to see for yourself how it all gets resolved. The Longest Ride lacks energy and logic and as love stories go its dull. Not to put too fine a point on it or anything but these are not the best qualities in a movie. Sometimes in these situations its better just to get the book. No Dont do that either.

Photo Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation MOVIE REVIEW The Longest Ride Running time 128 minutes. Rated PG-13 (tasteful sex/nudity/war). Now playing. Only tear-jerker specialist Nicholas Sparks perhaps the most-filmed novelist so far this century could come up with a story combining a modern-day bull rider and a Holocaust refugee in his trademark North Carolina settings. Not that these two characters ever meet in ""The Longest Ride which offers tales of love overcoming obstacles in two very different eras in whats roughly equivalent to a double feature of two earlier Sparks adaptations ""The Notebook"" (good) and ""Dear John"" (not good). Scott Eastwood -- the 29-year-old son of you-know-who in his first lead in a major studio production -- plays Luke who has returned to the rodeo circuit seeking the world championship after a years absence even though his doctor insists hes risking his life after a serious earlier fall. With looks voice and a grin reminiscent of Scotts real-life old man -- he also sets a mean picnic table and has good manners -- Luke quickly captures the heart of Sophia (rising starlet Britt Robertson) a college student from New Jersey who aspires to be an art curator. Its not until Luke takes another spill -- and Sophia drops out of a coveted summer internship in New York -- that she learns of his head injury and pleads with him to quit. Though equally smitten he refuses. Oona Chaplin as Ruth and Jack Huston as Ira.Photo Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Fortunately for them (and us) the couple has already crossed paths with Ira (Alan Alda) a nonagenarian whom Luke rescues from a burning car after an accident. At Iras direction Sophia retrieves a basket full of old letters recounting a love story with far more interesting problems (not to mention better acting) than the Luke-Sophia one. Back in 1940s North Carolina young Ira (played by Jack Huston John Hustons grandson) meets Ruth a beautiful and cultured Viennese Jew (played by Oona Chaplin who trumps Eastwood and Huston in genetics with not only Charlie C. as a grandfather but also Eugene ONeill as a great-grandfather) whos fled her native Austria. A Hemingway-esque injury in World War II renders Ira unable to father the children whom schoolteacher Ruth so desperately craves putting a severe strain on their relationship. The closest they come to parenthood is briefly raising one of her students which ends with heartbreak. But Ruth -- who has been dead for a while when the main story starts -- shares with Sophia a love of modern art even if Luke sneers that a gallery full of it ""has more bulls - - t than where I work."" Can the ailing Ira help the young lovers work things out in his limited time left on Earth -- or even afterward? Lets just say Sparks works up to an ending thats as shamelessly preposterous as it is predictable. George Tillman Jr. who directed the underrated ""Men of Honor"" makes this all a fairly painless experience with the help of some nice period detail and very solid performances by Huston and Chaplin. Scott Eastwood as Luke a former champion bull rider looking to make a comeback.Photo Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Young Eastwood is even more objectified than Channing Tatum was in ""Dear John"" -- there are utterly gratuitous views of his backside and abs in addition to some squeaky-clean shower nooky -- while Robertson handles the dramatic heavy lifting in their scenes together. A number of lines drew snickers from the audience at the screening I was at but coming down too hard on this load of schmaltz -- as I said when reviewing my first Sparks adaptation back in 2002 -- feels like taking a baseball bat to a sack full of newborn kittens.

"The Longest Ride is a lotta bull review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Longest Ride is a lotta bull reviewIts the time of year when the sap rises the syrup flows and the teardrops fall as another Nicholas Sparks novel morphs into a movie. The Longest Ride is this years treaclefest.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 9 2015The Longest RideStarring Scott Eastwood Britt Robertson Alan Alda and Oona Chaplin. Directed by George Tillman Jr. At GTA theatres. 128 minutes. PGIts the time of year when the sap rises the syrup flows and the teardrops fall as another Nicholas Sparks novel morphs into a movie.The Longest Ride is this years spring treaclefest. It matches Scott Eastwoods Luke a buff and steer-straddling North Carolina cowboy with Britt Robertsons Sophia a brainy and fetching college gal from New Jersey. Article Continued BelowHes into rodeos barbecue and ""old school"" manly ways; shes into Andy Warhol Jackson Pollock and liberated female thinking. Could there be a more perfect romantic match? Scott Eastwood and Britt Robertson get to know each other in The Longest Ride the latest romance in the Nicholas Sparks heart-tugging line.Well youve got to ask Rango a seriously angry bull whom Luke is determined to ride to rodeo glory even if it kills him -- which it just might. The movie begins with Rango giving Luke a swift kick to the head but Lukes good with that miserable stack of sirloins.""This is what I do"" he tells Sophia. ""Its all I know.""The humans in this bizarre menage a trois at least make a cute couple. Eastwood is the son of Clint and looks distractedly like him right down to that shy grin and ""make my day"" scowl. Robertson will soon be seen opposite George Clooney in the summer blockbuster Tomorrowland. She obviously knows how to handle Hollywood and domineering men. But this wouldnt be a proper Nicholas Sparks heart-tugger without a parallel story loaded with tender flashbacks benevolent elders and Hallmark sentiments.This second romance recalling the earlier Sparks weeper The Notebook comes courtesy of Alan Aldas lovable codger Ira whom Luke and Sophia rescue after he crashes his car through a highway guardrail. While Ira recuperates in hospital he tells Sophia about the love of his life Ruth played by Oona Chaplin Charlies granddaughter. Ruth adored art too and collected loads of what Luke will later dismiss as ""squiggly lines on white canvas."" Iras memories flood back via a boxful of letters that he had in his car which Sophia rescued along with him.Ira and Ruth met and swooned in the 1940s during World War II a conflict that seriously affected their relationship and family dreams as we learn. The younger Ira is played by Jack Huston grandson of filmmaker John Huston and he Alda dont look at all alike. This is par for the course in a Nicholas Sparks movie. Why quibble over what your eyes see when the heart is at stake? The Longest Ride by the way is directed by George Tillman Jr. who has also made good and serious movies like Men of Honor and the criminally underseen The Inevitable Defeat of Mister amp; Pete.Here hes content to just fit into the Sparks mould shining an amber light and popping the questions.Can love conquer all? Can Luke tame Rango and lasso Sophia? Did Ira and Ruth work things out?And heres one from me Will this movie ever end?It runs a long 128 minutes.

"The Longest Ride (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Longest Ride (PG-13) This love story between a rodeo rider and a college student is light on romance and heavy on the bull. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com4/9/2015 Editor rating 1.5 Here are some of the things I learned while watching The Longest Ride the new movie based on (yet another) Nicholas Sparks bestseller Clint Eastwood passed along some solid genes. Jennifer Lawrence has a doppelganger. Love requires sacrifice (""always"") but not necessarily for long or in particularly punishing ways. Cowboys and art lovers can live in harmony. Bull riding is not ever going to be something I care about. And if characters must read letters during the course of a movie I would find it helpful if the letters existed for a reason and not just as a plot device. But maybe the most important thing I learned was this Merely adding an older generation of lovers to a love story does not make your romance one for the ages. Doesnt even make it The Notebook. The Longest Ride could have been a decent story about stoic but gentlemanly bull rider Luke (Scott Eastwood) and soon-to-be college grad Sophia (Britt Robertson) who have to work hard to make room for each other in their very different lives. They meet at a rodeo. Shes heading for a prestigious internship at an art gallery in Manhattan after graduation. He lives on a ranch in North Carolina -- yeah I wondered about that too -- and is determined to become the top bull rider in the country after suffering a terrible injury. They are strangers in each others worlds etc. (the amusing scene in which bland but stone cold handsome Luke cowboy hat and all picks up Sophia at her sorority house for their first date is precisely the sort of fish-out-of-water scene the movie should have included more of). They like each other but you know trouble is coming because the second Sophia mentions the words ""bad timing"" the thunder rolls ominously. Instead of focusing on the struggles of this relationship though The Longest Ride introduces elderly Ira (Alan Alda) whom Luke and Sophia rescue from a car crash at the end of their first date. As Luke lugs Ira to safety Sophia pulls a box of letters from Iras burning car (he just carries them around as one does). Later she returns to the hospital every day to read a letter to him for the sole reason that Ira is a catalyst tasked with teaching the younger set a little something about perseverance love and sacrifice. The idea perhaps is to add depth and poignancy and a reminder that no matter how much time we have its never enough. But the storyline told in painfully contrived flashbacks merely adds dull cumbersome length to a movie that runs more than two hours. The younger Ira (Jack Huston) falls for the new art-loving girl at his synagogue Ruth (Oona Chaplin) and courts her in cliches. They dance kiss frolic on the beach. ""What right do I have to be happy when theres so much suffering in the world?"" she asks. Dont worry. Sufferings a-coming. Ira proves himself brave in World War II on an artificial-looking battlefield but comes home a different man. They cant have children and they fight. For some reason Ira keeps writing her these letters describing the wonder of their life together even while they are presumably living it which makes no sense. The fault for this clunky set-up ultimately lies with Sparks novel but still the whole thing rings more false than Safe Haven and that movie had a ghost. The most interesting angle involves Black Mountain College a sort of educational artists colony near Asheville during the late 30s and 1940s but the movies invocation of it is too slapdash to make any real impact. Theres obviously an audience out there with an insatiable appetite for romance -- Sparks books have sold millions of copies and every damned one gets adapted into a film. The fact is some of the movies arent bad such as Dear John or The Lucky One (or even the aforementioned The Notebook if weeping hysterically is your thing). The Longest Ride though is right there with The Last Song as one of the worst of the Sparks adaptations a love story that doesnt make you long for romance so much as tire of it all too quickly.

Their story is a bore but the love-story-within-a-story saves the film.Britt Robertson and Scott Eastwood star in the film version of the Nicholas Sparks best-selling novel ""The Longest Ride.""(Photo 20th Century Fox)Story Highlights3 stars (out of 5)The film starts as all Nicholas Sparks romances must with a pair of star-crossed lovers.Scott Eastwood Clints son plays the leading man a cowboy named Luke.Another love story set during WWII overshadows the present-day love story by every possible metric.Its no fun shooting fish in a barrel even when that barrel has the name ""Nicholas Sparks"" stenciled on the side. But with ""The Longest Ride"" the latest adaptation of one of the authors treacly predictable romances that barrel is at least a little bit bigger and enough fish survive the slaughter to make the film not a wholly unwelcome diversion.It starts as all Sparks romances must with a pair of star-crossed lovers Sophia (Britt Robertson) a worldly sorority sister bound to leave North Carolina for the New York art scene and Luke (Scott Eastwood) a simple country boy and world-class bull rider. She balks at the prospect of attending a rodeo -- in cowboy boots no less -- with her sorority sisters but a couple of Bud Lights later shes whooping and hollering for Luke who runs from an angry bull straight into her heart.And just like that she has herself a cowboy fling. A fling is all its supposed to be -- he has a ranch to tend and she has big-city aspirations and an impending art degree burning a hole in her pocket.Their romance is flat from the start. Shes all plucky go-getter hes all laconic perfection bringing flowers buying drinks opening doors introducing his mother (and doesnt seem to mind when she busts out the baby pics). The conflict such as it is never seems like anything insurmountable. She wants to move and he wants to be a champion bull rider despite a past injury that threatens to cripple him.Their love story gets even less interesting when Ira (Alan Alda) enters their lives. Driving home from a date in the pouring rain the couple spot a car on fire on the side of the road and rescue an injured old man and his box of hand-written letters all addressed to his dead wife. Iras eyesight is conveniently too poor to read the letters so Sophia offers to read them aloud kicking off a second parallel love story told in gauzy period-piece flashbacks.Right around the start of World War II Ira falls hard for Ruth (Oona Chaplin) a vivacious Jewish emigre who longs for a large family and a life full of art. That dream is put on hold by the war and when Ira returns from battle hes a changed man -- and incapable of siring children.Ira and Ruths love story overshadows the present-day love story by every possible metric The stakes are higher the conflicts deeper the actors better and less storybook-pretty. Chaplins Ruth is the most fully realized character in the film with the most passion and charisma; shes the one your heart aches for.All of which makes it such a bore to return time and again to Luke and Sophia especially because Eastwood couldnt act his way out of a pair of Wranglers (he has his fathers face but not his charisma -- though he does put on a cowboy hat real fine).""The Longest Ride"" tells us time and again that love is about sacrifice. Theres plenty of that in Ira and Ruths story. But in Luke and Sophias its only Sophia who does the sacrificing in the lead-up to a conclusion so obvious youll roll your eyes in mere anticipation.Its exactly what youd expect except executed with more-than-typical competence with the help of a few excellent actors and some gorgeously photographed rodeo scenes that capture the drama and thrill of bull riding.""I didnt hate it"" isnt a high watermark for praise but when it comes to most Sparks adaptations its practically as good as winning an Oscar.The Longest Ride3 stars (out of 5) Director George Tillman Jr.Cast Scott Eastwood Britt Robertson Alan Alda Oona Chaplin.Rating Rated PG-13 for some sexuality partial nudity and some war and sports action.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

Photo Credit TNS / Michael Tackett advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A young couple finds inspiration in a love story from the past. Rated R. BOTTOM LINE The young Eastwood is better than you might expect though its Chaplin who shines in this Nicholas Sparks romance. CAST Scott Eastwood Britt Robertson Alan Alda Oona Chaplin LENGTH 208 The descendants of two screen legends star in ""The Longest Ride"" though they never appear in a scene together. One is Scott Eastwood son of actor-filmmaker Clint Eastwood who plays Luke Collins a rodeo rider intent on winning a championship. The other is Oona Chaplin granddaughter of Charlie Chaplin playing Ruth Levinson an Austrian Jew who fled the Nazis in the 1940s. Separated into narratives in different eras the two actors might as well be in completely different films. That is essentially what ""The Longest Ride"" is two unrelated love stories connected only by faint thematic echoes and occasional plot contrivances. Luke falls for a Wake Forest sorority girl Sophia (a bland Britt Robertson) who wants to run an art gallery just as small-town resident Ira Levinson (Jack Huston and Alan Alda at different ages) fell for the art-loving Ruth. The present meets the past when Luke pulls Ira from a burning car. From his hospital bed Ira tells his story in golden-hued flashbacks. advertisement | advertise on newsday If anything separates this latest adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel from the others its Ruth. Shes a rare real-world creation from an author whose characters usually cloister themselves away in quaint little beach towns. Chaplin an actress with large expressive eyes and an infectious smile makes Ruth come alive both as an energetic girl and as a grown woman whose dreams do not fully materialize. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviews Eastwood whose resume includes small roles in ""Invictus"" and ""Fury"" shows the stirrings of charisma in his first leading-man role. Some of that is in his DNA -- at the right angle he looks exactly like Dirty Harry Callahan -- but the young Eastwood has more sex appeal than his flinty father did. There isnt much to Luke beyond his blue eyes and cowboy gallantry but Eastwood by adding a touch of vulnerability just about makes us buy him. The films unlikely director George Tillman Jr. (""Soul Food"" the hip-hop biopic ""Notorious"") brings so much sensitivity and attention to detail to this material -- the bull-riding scenes are remarkably visceral -- that you occasionally forget youre watching a Nicholas Sparks film. The frequent canoodling and the fantasy ending will remind you.

(Michael Tackett) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday April 9 2015 213 PM Title The Longest Ride Film Info With Scott Eastwood Britt Robertson. A coed loves a bull rider. Director George Tillman Jr. (208) PG-13 Sexuality. Area theaters. Memo to young actors Get your Nicholas Sparks movie out of the way early as Scott Eastwood and Britt Robertson have in the groaner ""The Longest Ride."" Because it only gets tougher as you get older. The young performers -- one the spitting image of dad Clint -- survive the latest Sparks tearjerker with minimal embarrassment. That wasnt so for James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan in ""The Best of Me"" Josh Duhamel in ""Safe Haven"" or Amanda Seyfried in ""Dear John"" all of whom were well-known before they fulfilled their Sparks requirement. Of course the model is Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams newcomers in 2004 when they did ""The Notebook."" Thats the bar all Sparks flicks aim for including this new dreadful one. Sophia (Robertson) is a college student studying art at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. She meets Luke Collins (Eastwood) after seeing him bull-ride at a rodeo (where he gave her his hat the big lug). Bull-ridin Luke drawls is all he knows -- and hes obsessed with winning after a bad throw from a bronco. Sophia a Jersey girl in the South is hesitant. The two share heat but will it cool due to a clash of cultures? 1 photos view gallery Why Scott Eastwood is the ultimate chick magnet Luke is a guy who brings flowers when he picks Sophia up at her sorority picks up the check at dinner and picks up an old man after saving him from a burning car. Thats Ira played by Alan Alda whos acting feeble but is still welcome. Sophia visits Ira as he recovers in the hospital reading to him the love letters he wrote to his late wife Ruth. From Ira Sophia learns that ""love means sacrifice"" and other aphorisms that sound stolen from greeting cards. Guess whos going to get another chance for her heart right after he saddles up for a winning eight seconds on an aggravated animal? Sparks obsession with young couples echoing old couples -- and the interlocking pieces of hokey narrative conceit -- is strained to the brink. Even if you found ""The Notebook"" to be mawkish pap that storys ""Oh my God its them"" revelation seems inspired compared with whats come after. Eastwood and Robertson do their best and director George Tillman Jr. provides a steady hand. But the material is shopworn mysterious illnesses; dewy flashbacks (which in this film seem especially incongruous); impetuous swims in lilypad-filled lakes. If this is your particular poison it wont kill you. But anyone averse to Sparks sappy touch may get sick from all the bull.

Comments click to enlarge The Longest Ride Video Rated PG-13  128 minutes  2015 George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food) adapts a romance novel by Nicholas Sparks (The Notebook) and though Tillman doesnt quite elevate the maudlin material into serious drama the result is uncommonly sensitive. This runs longer than any previous Sparks adaptation but for good reason Tillman often lets scenes play out at a relaxed pace offsetting the contrived plotting and allowing the characters to conform to the actors personalities. An art student from New Jersey (Britt Robertson) bonds with a North Carolina rodeo cowboy (Scott Eastwood) after they save an old Jewish man from a car wreck (a nicely understated Alan Alda). As she helps the old man recuperate he tells her the story of his long happy marriage inspiring her to be more romantic. This is fairly naive in its depictions of Jewish life and modern art though not offensively so; one never doubts that Tillmans heart is in the right place.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Turning standard-issue romances into fairy-tale love stories has won the prolific Nicholas Sparks 12 New York Times bestsellers 10 film adaptations and millions of fans grateful by the crate-full. His latest ""The Longest Ride"" turns sagas about two distant couples into a storybook combination of World War II bewitchment and modern cowboy courtship. Directed by George Tillman Jr. (who last helmed the Michael Starrbury-scripted treasure ""The Inevitable Defeat of Mister amp; Pete"") this is spoon-fed entertainment but it tastes pretty good. Presented in a manner that is charming relaxed intimate and usually clear-eyed it highlights Luke a North Carolina rodeo champ and Sophia a trendsetting abstract-art-loving college senior recent acquaintances falling in love. There are supporting roles for their elderly kindred spirits Ira and Ruth whose long loving marriage began in the 1940s. Sophia visits Ira daily at the hospital after Luke rescues him from a traffic accident charmed by his love stories about dear now-deceased Ruth. The couples parallel sagas share similar themes of hope created and deferred and some jokes that work in either era like Viennese sophisticate Ruth fondly calling her small-town beau ""a country pumpkin."" When Ira explains that Americans say ""bumpkin"" she says either term works fine. The film works without top stars; the cast is a remarkable collection of performers descendants tapping lifetimes of movieland DNA. Clint Eastwoods son Scott plays Luke. Jack Huston grandson of John is Ira in his early years. Oona Chaplin granddaughter of Charlie appears as his beloved Ruth. Even Alan Alda playing present-day Ira is the son of a famed actor/director Robert Alda. Combine their families show business histories and you have a span of time reaching back approximately to Columbus. That is an incredible amount of Hollywood Boulevard street cred. Only young Britt Robertson playing Lukes new love Sophia is an interloper and she acts well nonetheless. As usual in Nicholas Sparks features the characters are attractive and sympathetic. Eastwoods true-blue Luke is instantly appealing both as hot eye candy and a warm personality. While hes never less than gentlemanly he worries Sophia by refusing to end his career after troubling injuries. Ruth is distressed by Iras wounds as well. Winning the Purple Heart in Europe interrupts their family plans sending them to a life of daily love letters shared passion for fine art and hospitality to the local children rather than blood relatives of their own. Here and there the tone turns from light amusement to tragedy with ample time out for bone-crunching bull riding car wrecks and war scenes. Sparks whose movies over the past decade have made him the Santa Claus of date night provides plenty of treats for men and women alike. Each couples relationship woes trigger cliffhangers and are cured with a couple of tearful pity parties and a miraculous coincidence or two. Spoiler alert -- there are happy endings. Michael Tackett  20th Century Fox Scott Eastwood and Britt Robertson star in ""The Longest Ride."" ""The Longest Ride"" runs long on the naive and escapist light on irony cynicism and passion beyond PG-13. Little that happens here will surprise Sparks loyalists and less will disappoint them. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"The Longest Ride review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review The Longest Ride The Longest Ride Michael Tackett/Twentieth Century Fox Based on the bestselling novel by master storyteller Nicholas Sparks ""The Longest Ride"" centers on the star-crossed love affair between Luke (Scott Eastwood) a former champion bull rider looking to make a comeback and Sophia (Britt Robertson) a college student who is about to embark upon her dream job in New York Citys art world. Based on the bestselling novel by master storyteller Nicholas Sparks ""The Longest Ride"" centers on the star-crossed love affair between Luke (Scott Eastwood) a former champion bull rider looking to make a comeback and Sophia (Britt Robertson) a college student who is about to embark upon her dream job in New York Citys art world. (Michael Tackett/Twentieth Century Fox) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The latest Nicholas Sparks novel hits the screen with a soft pretty thud. No less than the ""Harry Potter"" adaptations or the ""Fast and Furious"" movies the novels of Nicholas Sparks form the basis of a consistent film franchise in which the characters names and crises and letters-read-aloud voice-overs may change but its the same wish-fulfillment universe across title after title. The public likes what the public likes even if the public likes some Sparks adaptations more than others.""The Longest Ride"" the 10th Sparks title to hit the screen with a soft pretty thud can be described the way Scott Eastwood (male lead son of Clint looks plausible in a cowboy hat) is described in the opening seconds of the movie ""easy on the eyes and a magician on a bull."" The movie is easy on the eyes. And Sparks is a magician with the bull. From the size of the American flag hanging inside the heros farmhouse in ""The Longest Ride"" we certainly know which country were in and since its Sparks we acknowledge were back in the magical emerald-green kingdom of coastal North Carolina. Eastwood plays a rising young rodeo star Luke who gets bucked off a particularly mean bull in the opening minutes. Thats just fate playing matchmaker; there at the rodeo with her college sorority sisters on the hunt for hot guys is art history major Sophia portrayed by Britt Robertson.Its love folks. Its love even though Luke doesnt understand Sophias admiration of ""squiggly lines on canvas"" and pretentious artistic abstraction. This guys ""old-school"" and says so. (""Call me old-school"" he says.) But hes willing to cross the divide just as this New Jersey transplant on scholarship wants to fit into Lukes risky life of bulls and traumatic bull-related head injuries. The courtly well-mannered hunkdom is a decent trade-off. Their first date a lakeside picnic ends dramatically when they come to the aid of a car accident victim who turns out to be Alan Alda in the role of Ira Levinson playing a Jewish variation on the life-changing ""magical Negro"" stereotypes in so many other movies. As hes pulled from the flames of his wreck a dazed Ira mutters something about ""the box"" which in a Sparks movie can mean one thing only a stash of precious correspondence the heroine will soon be reading aloud when the elder character isnt doing the reading in voice-over narration. Just once in a Sparks movie I wish someone would open a box and find absolutely nothing of value -- hardware store receipts a parking citation maybe some pencils. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. As in ""The Notebook"" we have two love stories singing to each other in ""The Longest Ride"" across the decades. Iras life with Ruth an Austrian World War II refugee played affectingly by Oona Chaplin begins in 1940 and comes with its full complement of heartbreak. Ruth was an art collector of exquisite taste which links handily to the present-day story of Sophia and Luke and Sophias artistic pursuits.The director of ""The Longest Ride"" is George Tillman Jr. (""Soul Food"" ""Notorious"") who seems like an odd choice for a Sparks romance. He appears to have gone into this assignment having studied the complete works of Lasse Hallstrom who directed ""Dear John"" and ""Safe Haven"" two previous Sparks adaptations for their honey-glow sunsets and utter fraudulence. But thats not even a criticism with this material; its simply a fact. Review Desert Dancer Roger Moore ""So you are an artist"" an Iranian member of the Basij the countrys paramilitary morality police hisses at the hero of ""Desert Dancer"" who is about to be punished. ""Beat him ... artistically"" You have to get by the occasional risible moment of melodrama to get into ""Desert Dancer"" another account... ""So you are an artist"" an Iranian member of the Basij the countrys paramilitary morality police hisses at the hero of ""Desert Dancer"" who is about to be punished. ""Beat him ... artistically"" You have to get by the occasional risible moment of melodrama to get into ""Desert Dancer"" another account... (Roger Moore) Tillman has a light but effective touch with his actors. Alda grins and yanks at our heartstrings like the wily pro he is. And its nice to see Lolita Davidovich again playing Lukes careworn yet ravishing widowed mother perpetually sitting on the farmhouse porch waiting for the next scene to begin. Even when Eastwood and Robertson pleasant enough company threaten to float off the screen ""The Longest Ride"" glides along and delivers its reheated comfort food by the ton.

Scott Eastwood and Britt Robertson play a bull rider and a sorority girl who meet at the rodeo. Photo Michael Tackett / Michael Tackett / 20th Century Fox Longest Ride is funny but oops ... it wasnt supposed to be 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Theres no truth in ""The Longest Ride."" Theres no truth in the personalities no truth in the relationships no truth in the backstory no truth in the heart-to-heart conversations. But to say that isnt quite enough. Theres no truth even in the camera setups and the snatches of dialogue heard in the background -- or even in the positioning of bodies within the frame. Everything in the movie is suffused by a vision of life that is resoundingly and evidently false but as this vision is not repulsive but is intended to reassure the lies dont produce anger or frustration. No they bring on the laughs. Based on the Nicholas Sparks novel ""The Longest Ride"" tells the story of a bull rider and an upwardly mobile sorority girl who meet one day at the rodeo ... But no you dont really want to hear this do you? If the movie is to be remembered for anything its for the presence of Scott Eastwood in his first significant starring role. Scott is the son of you-know-who but I forgot all about that until 20 minutes in when I noticed the resemblance. He doesnt have Dads crazed quizzical look but he has the squint and the voice not to mention the good looks. Scott resembles the big guy enough for that to be interesting but not so much that its distracting. In ""The Longest Ride"" Sophia (Britt Robertson) and Luke (Eastwood) are immediately confronted by the challenges and sacrifices of love. His life well its on the ranch and the rodeo circuit. But Sophia is a New Jersey girl with a love of art who is just a couple of months away from starting an internship in New York City. Much is made of this art-gallery internship throughout the movie Should Sophia stay with the man she loves ... or take a job that pays no money? Hmm. Is that really a hard one? Unfortunately theres only so much Sparks and screenwriter Craig Bolotin can do with the art lover/bull rider romance -- how many times can they make him land on his head after all? So the movie introduces an old man character a forlorn and romantic geezer who just cant shut up about the big love of his life. During each of Sophias daily visits to him she reads a different letter that he wrote many years before and on each occasion this introduces a flashback to the early 1940s. These flashbacks tell a second love story. In every case the old fellow Ira is remembering himself as a shy guileless selfless besotted young man but heres whats funny. Old Ira is played by Alan Alda and just the sound of Aldas voice works like an electric sign flashing the words ""wise guy."" To see him acting weepy and wistful is to expect him at any moment to say ""Fooled you"" and start laughing. Moreover we remember when Alda was young and he was nothing like the sweet fellow playing Iras younger incarnation here. He was an abrasive funny know-it-all. Anyway the effect of these Alda scenes directed with all the solemnity of the crypt is to keep ""The Longest Ride"" percolating at a level of low-grade hilarity. ""The Longest Ride"" is 139 minutes long which is amazing in itself and not in a good way. Yes two hours and 19 minutes for us to find out if Sophia is willing to pass up her big chance to work for free And for Luke to decide if hes tired of brain injury And for Ira to ... no I wont say it. But notice this From the old lady in ""Flashdance"" down to this minute when the stars of the movie are young people the older characters really need to take out life insurance.

"The Longest Ride looks pretty but looks arent everything - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Longest Ride looks pretty but looks arent everything The Longest Ride Michael Tackett / Twentieth Century Fox ""The Longest Ride"" centers on the star-crossed love affair between Luke (Scott Eastwood) a former champion bull rider looking to make a comeback and Sophia (Britt Robertson) a college student who is about to embark upon her dream job in New York Citys art world. ""The Longest Ride"" centers on the star-crossed love affair between Luke (Scott Eastwood) a former champion bull rider looking to make a comeback and Sophia (Britt Robertson) a college student who is about to embark upon her dream job in New York Citys art world. (Michael Tackett / Twentieth Century Fox) Betsy Sharkey Like The Notebook The Longest Ride has two parallel love stories Even with all ""The Longest Rides"" shots of the eye candy that is Scott Eastwood Nicholas Sparks latest romance to make its tissue-sodden way to the big screen is a wash. A long one.Montages of walks along the ocean horseback rides through verdant meadows and Eastwoods ever-present abs do provide endless pretty pictures. (In the looks department Eastwood definitely does Daddy Clint proud.) But pretty pictures do not make a movie. The two-plus hours is mostly marked by an emptiness born of scene after scene designed to blatantly manipulate emotions rather than trigger them.More disquieting is Sparks co-opting of the very compelling real-life story of Herb and Dorothy Vogel. The New York couple used Herbs modest postal worker salary to amass a modern art collection of incredible value. Their achievement recounted in Megumi Sasakis acclaimed 2008 documentary ""Herb amp; Dorothy"" sparked an onslaught of publicity for the unassuming pair who ultimately gave their entire collection to The National Gallery of Art where the public could see it for free rather than sell it for millions. A few details have been changed in both the book and the movie including their names and their hometown but the heart of their story becomes the uncredited heart of ""The Longest Ride."" The Longest Ride premiere is Hollywoods first rodeo Amy Kaufman Hollywood Boulevard has hosted its share of outrageous movie premieres over the years.

When ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" debuted in 2013 James Franco hopped in a hot air balloon and floated over the red carpet waving to tourists.

(Amy Kaufman) Alan Alda plays 91-year-old Ira Levinson who spends much of the salary he earns at the familys haberdashery (Herbs father was a tailor too) on his wife Ruths passion for paintings amassing a major modern art collection of incredible value.Director George Tillman Jr. who brought such a lovely restrained touch to the 2013 drama about two young inner city boys surviving a summer on their own in ""The Inevitable Defeat of Mister amp; Pete"" gets swamped by the sentiment that characterizes Sparks work. For fans of the book screenwriter Craig Bolotin makes only minor adjustments. Adding intellect insight or real romance are not among the changes. A look at the actors -- and activists -- that made it to the Los Angeles premiere of ""The Longest Ride."" Like ""The Notebook"" the Sparks film adaptation that remains the best of a bad lot ""The Longest Ride"" has two parallel love stories. One revolves around a newly minted couple the hot bull-riding got-to-save-the-family-farm-for-my-widowed-mom Luke Collins (Eastwood) and the smart grounded still-recovering-from-a-broken-heart Sophia Danko (Britt Robertson). Their meet cute comes after Lukes win at a local bull-riding competition that Sophias college classmates have dragged her to -- the promise of hot cowboys and line dancing are hard to turn down. Lukes near-lethal ride a year ago on a fearsome bull named Rango starts playing out in flashbacks as do so many other pieces of the puzzle. Rango portrayed with a great deal of bucking brio by a real bull named Rango is a muscular specimen in his own right and gets almost as much love from the camera as Luke.Luke and Sophias official first date connects them to Ira when they spot his crashed car and on closer inspection discover a badly injured Ira inside. Luke saves the elderly man pulling him from the burning auto. Sophia saves his precious box of love letters and the entwining of their lives begins.Alda who can be so affecting is given little to do except spend time in a hospital bed and provide a reason for flashbacks to Iras younger days. Most of what we know about him and his beloved Ruth is set in the post-World War II era. They plan to marry but boot camp and his service delay things. The war injury that leaves Ira unable to give Ruth the big family she wants threatens to end their story. But this is a Nicholas Sparks production so of course they make it through and begin collecting art instead.Ruth and Iras younger selves are played by Jack Huston the great Johns grandson and Oona Chaplin Charlies granddaughter and Eugene ONeills great-granddaughter. Its unclear between the family tree of Eastwood Chaplin and Huston who would win the Hollywood A-list legacy battle.Chaplin and Huston do a slightly better job of steaming up the screen than Eastwood and Robertson. Its not so much the actors fault as those distracting Eastwood abs. I dont think Huston ever gets a chance to join in the Calvin Klein-esque underwear shoot that is ready to spring into action any time Luke sheds his shirt.In a nod to Jewish culture and history we learn Ruths desire for family is tied to the loss of hers. Most of her relatives didnt make it out of Austria once Hitler took control. That reveal comes as she and Ira walk home from a synagogue moments that look remarkably like typical Southern Sunday go-to meeting scenes except for the ""good Shabbats.""Iras love letters which Sophia keeps stopping by the hospital to read to him become the key framing device to help Luke and Sophia work through their relationship issues. Both couples have conflicts that test their relationships. In fact ""The Longest Ride"" is filled with many moments when it seems all might fall apart. But true to the Sparks literary formula for Ira and Ruth Luke and Sophia it all works out in the end -- which would only qualify as a spoiler if it didnt.   -------------------------""The Longest Ride""MPAA rating PG-13 for some sexuality partial nudity and some war and sports actionRunning time 2 hours 19 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Oona Chaplin Trailer The Longest Ride Furious 7 fires fuel-injected fun on all cylinders Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-the-longest-ride-review-20150408-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,thelongestride22,thelongestride,latimes

The Longest Ride (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) slavishly follows the well-worn and soggy Sparks path.Its an extremely successful formula. Nine previous adaptations of Sparks banal best sellers have netted about 800 million at the box office. But lets not be cynical -- since no one in Sparksland ever is.USA TODAYScott Eastwood takes reins for Longest RideThe main reason to see this cliched movie is handsome star Scott Eastwood who bears a striking resemblance to his famous father. His blue eyes high cheekbones and chiseled jaw have Clint Eastwoods genetic imprint. His toned pecs and abs are given nearly as much focus since theres a target audience women who like to swoon at the movies.USA TODAYUSA TODAY Latest World and US News - USATODAY.comEastwood 29 plays a hunky but gentlemanly bull rider. He lives in a well-appointed former barn. Meadow grass blows in the breeze whenever he saunters by.Sparks writes modern fairy tales and theres a place for simple escapist fantasies in a complicated and less-than-idyllic world. Occasionally a Sparks story rises above the pack such as 2004s The Notebook. Most fall into syrupy formula thats at worst eye-rolling and at best laughable. The performances never rise above the cloying material though Eastwood acquits himself best with an affable charm.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare In The Longest Ride a former bull-riding champion falls for a college student but life threatens to tear them apart. The film is based on a Nicholas Sparks novel. VPCThe romance between champion bull rider Luke and college senior Sophia (Britt Robertson) covers a predictable checklist of Sparks-isms. Gorgeous heartthrob falls for smart cute girl. Older often sick or feeble characters impart sage advice. Beautiful landscapes loom large. Gauzy curtains sway as the lovebirds get tastefully amorous.Scenes of Luke atop a bucking bull mastering what is eloquently called ""the toughest sport on dirt"" are surprisingly tedious. He needs to stay on the fierce creature for eight seconds in a succession of bouts to make the finals. Worried about a head injury Luke suffered when thrown off a bull his mom (Lolita Davidovich) begs him to quit.""Its eight seconds"" his mom says. ""That girl could be the rest of your life.""Thats how people talk in Sparksville. USA TODAYScott Eastwood puts the bull in riding lessonThe pair meet cute at one of his bull sessions. Sophia is dragged there by a sorority sister. Luke tosses her his dusty sweaty cowboy hat and the romance is off and running. He had her at ""Howdy.""On their first date -- at a lakeside picnic complete with tablecloth and barbecue -- he saves an elderly man from a burning car. Who could possibly resist a hot heroic and thoughtful cowboy?Sophia tries rather wanly. Shes set to graduate in two months and bound for an internship in New York. USA TODAYStunt double talks about Longest RideFleshing out the Sparks playbook Ira (Alan Alda) the old man saved by Luke had a wicker box he asked Sophia to retrieve from his car. She paws through it. Its a box of love letters of course. Sophia spends much of the movie reading the letters to the ailing Ira. The story shifts to flashbacks detailing the romance of young Ira (Jack Huston) and his beloved Ruth (Oona Chaplin).Ira and Ruths story comes full circle into the lives of Sophia and Luke in an ending so ridiculously contrived its almost worth the movies extended length. Almost.The Longest Ride is sentimental forced and silly but its sure to hit the bulls-eye with its intended audience. 9 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1FF0wYj",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/04/09/the-longest-ride-review/25466015/,200,thelongestride23,thelongestride,usatoday

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet It rains four times during The Longest Rides two-plus hours. Rain is not an unusual occurrence for a movie based on a book by wealthy sentiment-peddler Nicholas Sparks but while Ride does use the weather to heighten both melodrama and romance the downpour never serves as a direct backdrop for a passionate clinch or a tearful reunion. The movie contains other items from the Sparks checklist--handwritten letters soldiers paeans to the romantic majesty of coastal North Carolina death--but doesnt milk all of those for maximum shamelessness either. In this restraint it shows the mildest hints of maturity in what has become a de facto franchise.For example the movie doesnt insist on giving Luke (gristle-free Clint Eastwood substitute Scott Eastwood) its contemporary romantic hero a particularly honorable or heroic profession. Instead hes just a bull rider albeit one of the best damn bull riders in the world and one so honorably ""old school"" that he doesnt believe in women buying him a drink or calling him first. The woman in question is Sophia (Britt Robertson) a smart and sensible college senior who makes a suspiciously quick transformation from utter disinterest in sorority-cowgirl affectation to paying keen attention to the sexy high-stakes world of bull riding. She also loves art as she explains ""I love art. I love everything about it.""Luke and Sophia may have mismatched backgrounds and unequal levels of art love but they dont have any reason to handwrite romantic letters to each other which is probably why they happen upon a car crash and rescue Ira Levinson (Alan Alda) box of love letters in tow. As Sophia runs into relationship trouble with Luke she visits Ira in the hospital and reads the letters with him leading to flashbacks that follow a younger Ira (Jack Huston) and his beloved wife Ruth (Oona Chaplin) as they navigate their own troubles in the 40s 50s and 60s.Director George Tillman Jr. doesnt integrate the two stories particularly well. The flashbacks always leave off at a crucial narrative juncture but the movie rarely shows present-day Ira halting his story--few of the scenes between Alda and Robertson have endings at all. Their entire relationship exists primarily to deliver those flashbacks and draw tenuous parallels between the two couples. (""Ruth also loved art"" Ira excitedly notes not mentioning if she also enjoyed other equally obscure concepts such as food or sunny days.) Inelegant transitions abound even when the movie sticks to the present where the fated Luke and Sophia have awkward faux-flirty conversations. The movie manages to generate some heat between its young leads in exactly one effective sequence that cuts together Lukes professional bull-riding Sophias attempt to ride a practice rig and the couple having sex constantly. Even then they seem to like each other because they both look good semi-naked.Back in the past though Huston and Chaplin show hints of timeless charm enlivening the material not unlike the way Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling almost sold the hokum of The Notebook. The movie draws Ira and Ruths story out too long but in its broad way it actually addresses the bumpiness of a long-term relationship rather than tearing its lovers apart via war disapproving parents or bad luck (though it does touch upon two of those three). Even the sketchily developed art business that supposedly connects Ruth and Sophia is a welcome respite from Sparks usual vague churchiness. The relative decency of the flashback material only makes Sophia and Lukes big conflict--he wants to keep riding bulls even though an old head injury threatens his life--look sillier. Bull riding comes across as such a comically stupid endeavor that attempts to equate it with anything in Iras narrative feel muddled at best especially when the movie tries to wring suspense from Lukes confrontation with his greatest enemy the villainous bull that threw him off and gave him his head injury in the first place.In other romances this would be crazy ridiculous but its only low-level nutty for Sparks. (Despite the varying screenplay and directing credits the author--who has begun producing the adaptations of his work--is the true auteur at work in this unofficial series). Despite undermining its own better qualities The Longest Ride still qualifies as one of the best Sparks films by virtue of not including any love-ghosts or destructive misinformation about how Alzheimers works. It doesnt jumble all that rain letter-writing and North Carolina scenery into something new or even very good but it has its fleeting moments of low-key likability.

(Michael Tackett) A movie review of ""The Longest Ride"" Were in the realm of Nicholas Sparks with this story about two very nice couples from two different generations finding true love and then grappling with the difficulties of making love last. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times ""The Longest Ride"" is a picture thats pretty as well pretty as a picture. With its misty vistas of gauzy fog draped delicately over lush North Carolina forests and gleaming lakes it looks like a tourist brochure brought to life. Pretty yes. But not nearly as pretty as the people in those settings. Movie Review 1/2   The Longest Ride with Britt Robertson Scott Eastwood Alan Alda Oona Chaplin Jack Huston. Directed by George Tillman Jr. from a screenplay by Craig Bolotin based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks. 136 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some sexuality partial nudity and some war and sports action.

You may not be familiar with ""Rides"" stars but you certainly know their last names Chaplin Huston Eastwood. That would be Oona Chaplin granddaughter of Charlie. Jack Huston grandson of John. And Scott Eastwood son of ... who else? Were talking Hollywood royalty here. And with Scott in particular the family resemblance is strong though there isnt the aura of anger and danger one finds in Clint. With its story about two very nice couples from two different generations finding true love and then grappling decorously with the difficulties of making love last were in the realm of Nicholas Sparks. Starting with 2004s ""The Notebook"" were now up to 10 Sparks-derived pictures and counting many of them set in North Carolina where the author makes his home. Directed by George Tillman Jr. (""Soul Food"" ""Men of Honor"") ""Ride"" smoothly merges two separate love stories. Theres a contemporary romance between young people from very different worlds -- Luke (Eastwood) a handsome professional rodeo bull rider and Sophia (Britt Robertson) a very pretty art-loving college senior. And then theres the story of Jewish couple Ira (Huston) a shy haberdasher and Ruth (Chaplin) an outgoing schoolteacher who fall in love in the early 1940s and whose marriage lasts for decades. Unlike Sparks novel where the two stories awkwardly intersect only at the very end the intersection in the movie comes early when Luke and Sophia rescue Ira now a widower in his 90s (played by Alan Alda) from a car wreck. They learn of his love for his wife through tender letters he wrote to her throughout their marriage which Sophia reads in his hospital room and are brought to life in flashbacks. The older couples trials and abiding love offer relational guideposts for the young people. ""Ride"" is shamelessly manipulative -- the pain of childlessness and a potentially fatal medical condition are in the mix even the Holocaust is briefly referenced -- but Tillman brings such an affecting sincerity to his handling of the material that the picture seldom turns maudlin. Carolina settings star-crossed lovers elements of tragedy Sparks formula works. Get out your handkerchiefs and rest assured that there will be uplift at the end.

Instead of one couple theres two -- and hes even stretched out of his blond/Southern/Christian comfort zone to make the older pair Jewish. For balance and for pandering to the powerful conservative audience who made American Sniper a megahit his young heartthrob is a blond Southern bull rider named Luke Collins who lives on a ranch with his momma. (Every viewer in my home state of Texas will coo when she shows off a baby picture of him wearing a cowboy hat in the bathtub.) Even cannier Lukes played by Clint Eastwoods son Scott Eastwood who pairs his daddys crinkle-cut eyes with abs you could use as a cattle guard.Luke is a hero on the Professional Bull Riders circuit a three-time champion forced to take a yearlong break when a monster named Rango gored him in Las Vegas. Director George Tillman Jr. makes full use of the lights black leather and glamour of this modern breed of rock amp; roll riders. As a bonus Tillman and screenwriter Craig Bolotin have a pair of announcers who serve as a countrified Greek chorus spouting a continual patter of Things We Need to Know About Luke. In case were blind they assure us that hes ""young easy on the eyes and a magician on the bull"" and later in case were blind to his stakes they caution ""This could kill him""Film Details The Longest Ride RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time139 min. More Info Trailer In a near-deadly meet-cute Luke completes a successful eight-second ride gets chased to the railing by a beast and locks eyes with an art student named Sophia (Britt Robertson) dragged there by her sorority sisters to slum it with some sexy wranglers. When he loses his cowboy hat she picks it up -- the dustbowl inversion of a mademoiselle dropping her handkerchief -- and at the after-hoedown he adjusts the brim on her head and offers to buy Sophia a domestic beer.The two have nothing in common except golden good looks and a fondness for looking at each other and grinning. Still Robertson and Eastwood do that well enough that we buy their chemistry. Robertson has a great giggle and Tillman cranks up the sexual tension as Luke plonks her on a practice barrel strung up in his barn to teach this city girl how to straddle a wild ride. Soon after she decides pop music gives her headaches and switches the radio to country. But its harder to give up her plan to move to Manhattan after graduation even though Luke fits in as well with her art-world friends as ""Crocodile"" Dundee. Asked his opinion on a gallery full of squiggles he jokes ""I think theres more bullshit here than where I work."" Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Tillman has fun contrasting an old-fashioned gentleman like Luke with the frat bros at Sophias college soft man-children in pastel polo shirts who text late at night instead of courting her with dinner dates and flowers. But even Luke could learn a love lesson from widower Ira Levinson (Alan Alda) who literally crashes into their lives with a box of love letters he wrote to his wife Ruth a Jewish immigrant from Vienna from 1940 until her death. Jack Huston and a ferociously vibrant Oona Chaplin play Ira and Ruth in flashbacks where they have to tangle with traumas larger than Lukes lack of a college education. (If youre counting thats three descendants of Hollywood royalty in the cast.) After Ira and Ruth are engaged hes shipped off to World War II where hes shot someplace vague that makes him sterile. Instead of children they collect modern art a plot thread fated to tie in to Luke and Sophias romance. Perhaps its a hint that when Tillman shoots a raging bull in slo-mo its snot flings across the screen like a Jackson Pollock.Its easy to tease a Nicholas Sparks movie. Its harder to admit that hes good at his niche -- and has a string of 10 films nearly all profitable to prove it even if every one has been savaged by critics. (His average Rotten Tomatoes score is 25 percent.) Hes thoroughly uncynical about love like a 19-year-old child bride doodling hearts on her wedding invitations. He believes love is so powerful that it can salvage lives and control the weather. Twice here when characters get their hearts scuffed thunder claps and it begins to rain. Yet the storys emphasis is on choice not fate or coincidence. The people at its center are kept apart not by scheming bad guys or boneheaded misunderstandings but by a genuine concern for one anothers happiness. Ira can no more pressure Ruth into a life without children than Luke can ask Sophia to give up her career.The structure is clunky. Retro sequences are launched by Sophia bursting into Iras bedroom after a fight with Luke and asking him to ""take my mind off of it."" Still a good romance can make us endure an implausible plot as long as the leads have heat. Luke and Sophias connection feels true. Who cares about the mechanics? By the time The Longest Ride runs right off a cliff were already strapped in to the passenger seat.

Yes its time for another Nicholas Sparks adaptation. As spring perennials go a new Nicholas Sparks movie has come to seem as inevitable as tax day and allergy season and only mildly less irritating to the senses. Though the character names and model-perfect faces may change (ever so slightly) the place (coastal North Carolina) remains the same as do the trials and tribulations facing the star-crossed lovers who traverse its shores. The formula is by now as proven (and critic-proof) as Marvel or Tyler Perry -- so why tinker with it in the least? Rest assured ""The Longest Ride"" does nothing of the sort as it parallels the fates of two couples from different eras navigating the usual Sparks-ian gauntlet of war class relations cataclysmic accidents and life-altering medical conditions. Appealing performances by a trio of second- and third-generation Hollywood kids keep this three-hankie twaddle more bearable than it deserves but ""Ride"" will surely go the longest with audiences for whom this is not their first Sparks rodeo. Based on Sparks 2013 novel of the same title ""The Longest Ride"" may be most notable for featuring the first lead performance by Scott Eastwood the youngest son of Clint (who cast him in supporting roles in ""Gran Torino"" and ""Invictus"") and an uncanny doppelganger for his father as a ""Rawhide""-era contract player -- a bit less squinty and gravelly-voiced but with an effortless rugged charisma that also at times recalls the late Paul Walker. Hes comfortably cast as one of Sparks favored mans men a professional rodeo rider named Luke Collins seen in the movies early moments getting ejected in particularly brutal fashion from a bucking bronc called Rango (credited ""as himself"") and landing within a few inches of his life. That opening echoes the greatest of all rodeo movies Nicholas Rays ""The Lusty Men"" (1952) in which Robert Mitchums injured ex-rider becomes reluctant mentor to a rising young star (Arthur Kennedy). But here real cowboys like Luke dont let things like a traumatic head injury keep them down especially when theres a family farm and widowed mother (a very good Lolita Davidovich) to support. So one year later hes back in the saddle again where he catches the eye of Sophia (Britt Robertson) a Wake Forest art-history major on the eve of graduating and starting an internship with a tony New York gallery. Soon a summer fling has sprung (Sparks doesnt really do winter) and their first date is a doozy dinner followed by an unscheduled stop in a roadside ditch -- not so Luke can cop a feel but so he can rescue the disoriented elderly man (Alan Alda) whos crashed his now-burning car during a heavy downpour. Sophia pitches in too rescuing a box of old letters from the passenger seat just in the nick of time. And the stage is set for one of Sparks bifurcated then-and-now narratives in which the lessons of the past help to guide the action of the present. So far so ""The Notebook"" and (like almost everything Sparks does) so very WASP. But lo and behold ""The Longest Ride"" turns out to be the authors salvo to the diversity crowd. The Alda character is revealed as one Ira Levinson a Jewish nonagenarian whose coveted letters tell of his 60-year romance with wife Ruth (Oona Chaplin) an Austrian emigre who arrived in America at the onset of World War II. And as Sophia reads the letters aloud to a recovering Ira that love story plays out in sepia-toned flashbacks rendered with all the lived-in period feel of a Restoration Hardware doorknob. Screenwriter Craig Bolotin (""Black Rain"") and director George Tillman Jr. (""Soul Food"" ""Faster"") lay on the Judaism thick but unconvincingly as if cultural specificity could be measured in phlegmatic Borscht Belt accents and references to Shabbos. Alda Chaplin and Jack Huston (who plays the young Ira) may be the least likely onscreen Jews since Daniel Craig and Jamie Bell played Polish-Jewish brothers in the Holocaust drama ""Defiance"" while the raven-haired olive-skinned Chaplin (daughter of Geraldine and the Chilean cinematographer Patricio Castilla) also looks about as Austrian as Frida K. When the movie arrives at a couple of scenes set during Friday services at the local synagogue Tillman shoots them as if they were some exotic tribal ritual. And though the year is 1940 and Ruths reasons for fleeing Europe patently obvious the name Hitler is never uttered once. (The movies credited ""Jewish studies consultant"" may wish to omit this one from her resume.) Yet despite its raging inauthenticity the past proves more engaging than the present in ""The Longest Ride"" in part because theres something real at stake in Ira and Ruths relationship -- namely her desire to have a large family and his inability to oblige (owing to the complications of a war injury). The other reason is that Huston (grandson of John) and Chaplin (even burdened with her silly accent) have terrific chemistry together every one of their smoldering glances worth a few hundred pages of Sparks purple prose. Meanwhile back in the present Luke and Sophia steam up several different shades of stained glass in a shower scene that evokes the late softcore maestro Zalman King and try to figure out if there is enough room in their relationship for Rango the bull and New York (which whenever anyone mentions it sounds as distant and forbidding as Siberia). Trust that Sparks -- a master of the outlandish deus-ex-machina finale -- will find a way. If ""The Longest Ride"" is partly Sparks tone-deaf valentine to Gods chosen people its also a jeremiad of sorts against the big-city elites (including no doubt this very critic) whom he feels wield too much cultural influence in our country. Like Sophia Ruth is an art aficionado who compensates for her childless womb by amassing an enviable collection of contemporary masters (Matisse Motherwell Passlof Rothko) much of it acquired from nearby Black Mountain College (a reminder that North Carolina has cutting-edge culture too). But Sparks and the filmmakers cant help taking a few cheap potshots at ""squiggly lines on a canvas"" and devising an art-auction climax that effectively says the sentimental value of a single unremarkable representational canvas is worth more than all of the worlds abstract marvels combined. That scene may qualify as Sparks baring his writerly soul to the crowd. But most of the movies target demo is sure to be too busy swooning over Eastwoods bared abs to even notice. Production designer Mark E. Garner and costume designer Mary Claire Hannans period re-creations have that overly shiny-and-new look of a model home or furniture showroom as if everything in the frame were untouched by human hands -- a problem exacerbated by the plastic washed-out textures of David Tattersalls digital cinematography.

This film captures the deep and beautiful emotions of love and life) And for the record you mentioned the climactic auction I am the auctioneer) Barry Ratcliffe Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says April 9 2015 at 1024 am These reviews are observant but just way too long given content and ultimate opinion. Reply Rhoda Marr says April 11 2015 at 904 pm Not to mention this critics ridiculous ""way with words"" desperately trying to show how expansive their grasp of the English language is. Is it good or not? Just say so. Jeezzzz Reply Michelle says April 9 2015 at 1011 am I love you. Thank you so much for this review. Your comments re Sparks inability to handle Judaism (and the inability of anyone adapting it to handle Judaism) are spot-on. Reply tlsnyder42 says April 8 2015 at 242 pm Another silly superficial elitist review that fails to examine the real problems with the movie or give any proper acknowledgement of how good this movie really was especially considering the genre. Reply Buz Kohan says April 7 2015 at 1022 am That was a quick fix but now anyone reading the review will wonder what I was talking about. Reply Buz Kohan says April 7 2015 at 1019 am Dont they ""weather"" the onslaught rather than ""whether"" it? Reply tsmithmpls says April 7 2015 at 518 am ""Two sets of star-crossed lovers whether an onslaught of personal crises in North Carolina."" The word youre looking for in this case is ""weather"" not ""whether"". Geez. Reply Sarah McIntyre says April 7 2015 at 318 am I cant wait to see this movie it looks so good Ive been trying to get tickets in advance for weeks so hopefully I can get them tomarrow Reply Bill says April 6 2015 at 1119 pm ""As spring perennials go a new Nicholas Sparks movie has come to seem as inevitable as tax day and allergy season and only mildly less irritating to the senses."" Why does Variety insist on assigning critics predisposed to dislike a movie or genre of movies to review them? Thats not exactly the best way to get an unbiased review as a result. Reply JK says April 6 2015 at 933 pm Alan Alda in his 70s plays a character portrayed in 1940 by Jack Huston who is in his mid-30s which would make Alda more than 100 years old since the contemporary story in the film is set in the present day.

If you are youre part of a Middle American fan club that has supported nine schmaltzy formulaic achingly sincere film adaptations of the novelists books to the cumulative box office tune of about 750000000. If youre not well The Longest Ride will feel like one of the longest 128 minutes of your life. Old-fashioned in all the most tedious ways this by-the-numbers romance between oddly mismatched lovers plods along in a way that will nonetheless provide the cinematic equivalent of an agreeable airplane novel read for the already converted. Whats most strange here is how Sparks in a calculated attempt to link people from very different worlds offers up social backgrounds for them that simply dont mix at all -- modern Southern college sorority life the circumstances for World War II Jewish refugees enclaves of modern art a half-century ago and today and per the title the good-ol-boy milieu of professional bull riding. On top of that no matter what crises may arise (and they are numerous) everyone is always perfectly attired and surrounded by pristine North Carolina settings in which no blade of grass is ever out of place. The pretty couple at the center of things has modern cowboy Luke (Scott Eastwood) comeback-minded after having been violently thrown by a mighty mean bull named Rango pursuing a very gentlemanly courtship of Wake Forest college senior Sophia (Britt Robertson) shortly before shes due to move to New York for a high-end art gallery internship. Lukes the sort to tote flowers when he shows up for their first date (""Call me old-school"" he bashfully intones) while Sophia is mentally already half-way out the school door on the way to her big-city future. But fate intervenes as it has a habit of doing when the couple rescue an old man from a car accident on a dark rainy night and take him to a hospital. While he recovers genial old gent Ira Levinson (Alan Alda) allows Sophia to read aloud to him from old letters that recount his poignant relationship with his beloved late wife Ruth. So even as its not explained why so many letters were written when in fact Ira and Ruth were in the same place most of the time back in the early 1940s we see extended flashbacks of the newly arrived Austrian Ruth (Oona Chaplin) a vivacious forthright immaculately attired young woman capturing the heart of the pleasant looking but exceedingly placid Ira (Jack Huston bearing absolutely no resemblance to Alda young or old). The couples many trials and tribulations notably including Iras Jake Barnes-like war injury that prevents him from giving Ruth the children she craves and their failure to adopt a parentless hillbilly boy who shows intellectual promise simply serve to demonstrate how few obstacles Luke and Sophia face compared to theirs. But more directly Ruths passion for modern art fostered at the (real) progressive Black Mountain College in North Carolina feeds oh-so conveniently into Sophias career interests while also providing the springboard for one of the most outrageously preposterous surprise endings in recent movies. Leaving his career origins in Soul Food and the Barbershop series (which he produced) very far behind indeed director George Tillman Jr. indulges nay embraces the sanitized banality of Sparks world with a straight face. Just as the basic plot points are hard to swallow even the most rudimentary aspects of the characters interactions feel forced artificial and unspontaneous. A significant part of the interest here surely lies in the films role as a showcase for four just moderately known young actors. Robertson who co-stars in the highly anticipated about-to-arrive Tomorrowland often seems to have a bridle on here keen to impart some spontaneity thats being kept in check. Eastwood in his first significant starring role after several supporting gigs most recently in Fury certainly resembles his dad both physically and in his inclination for minimal dialogue; hes easy on the eyes and comfortably inhabits a Western-style character but his potential remains to be determined. Curiously the couple from 70-odd years ago has been cast with grandchildren of Hollywood luminaries from that period. Huston displays none of the gumption associated with his director grandfather John or the latters thespian offspring. By contrast Chaplin granddaughter of Charles daughter of actress Geraldine and namesake of her grandmother is the sole younger actor to pop here; playing the only one of the youthful characters with any boldness or inclination to speak her own mind the unconventional-looking performer comes off as assertive driven and appealing in an idiosyncratic manner. But providing the film with whatever emotional grounding it can claim is Alda. Restricted almost exclusively to a hospital bed the 79-year-old actor makes the canned sentimentality of his 91-year-old character go down quite easily as he comments to Sophia about the vicissitudes of his life. The settings and compositions are picture-postcard the score syrupy the bull-riding coverage not entirely convincing the sentiments cliched and reassuring. But boy oh boy the ending In Sparks world when happiness rains it pours.

Fans of Sparks sappy trademarks -- manly men wearing distressed flannel shirts and driving weathered pickup trucks bright-eyed women with smarts and careers but lacking a manly man in a flannel shirt to make their lives complete -- will come away satisfied but the rest of the world may find all of this less than enchanting. The A-story falls into what a filmmaker friend of mine calls ""pretty white people with problems."" Luke (Scott Eastwood) is a champion bull rider whose career gets sidetracked after a nasty bucking leaves him injured. Gets back on the bull a year later he locks eyes with college senior Sophia (Britt Robertson ""Under the Dome"") who was dragged there by her sorority sisters. Manhattan-bound after her graduation from Wake Forest University she at first ignores Lukes invitations to dinner before eventually succumbing to his charms. On their way home from their date they spot a car that drove off the road; Luke carries driver Ira Levinson (Alan Alda) to safety while Sophia rescues a box on the passenger side that contains decades worth of Iras letters to his late wife Ruth. To help him recover Sophia reads the correspondence aloud to the hospitalized man leading to the B-story flashbacks of young Ira (Jack Huston ""Kill Your Darlings"") courting Ruth (Oona Chaplin ""Game of Thrones"") in 1940s North Carolina where Ruths family settled after fleeing Europe. See Video Scott Eastwood Britt Robertson Transcend Love Time in Nicholas Sparks The Longest Ride Trailer (Video) Director George Tillman Jr. (""Men of Honor"") and screenwriter Craig Bolotin (""Black Rain"") adapting Sparks novel relegate Ira to the role of Magical Geezer whose main importance to the story is teaching Luke and Sophia important lessons about life and love. As it turns out however the saga of Ira and Ruth feels more vital and has more at stake than whether or not Luke will stop bull riding or if Sophia will give up her ambitions in the art world to stay in North Carolina. The Levinsons after all had to contend first with World War II and later with their inability to bear children even though Ruth wanted a big family. As a schoolteacher she poured her desire to parent into taking care of her students particularly one impoverished child the culmination of whose story provides ""The Longest Ride"" with its only genuinely affecting moment. (Not among the couples problems was anti-Semitism since this film apparently exists in the same cuckoo dimension as ""The Identical"" where no such bigotry existed in the mid-century Deep South.) Also Read PETA Protest Planned for The Longest Ride Premiere Over Animal Cruelty at Rodeos (Updated) I found myself rewriting practical solutions to Luke and Sophias barely-there problems Settle in Marfa or some other Texas art colony where you can both pursue your passions. Or better yet let Sophia move to New York City where the chiseled Luke could easily get a gig as an underwear model The real love story in ""The Longest Ride"" is between Eastwood and David Tattersalls camera which spends so much time leering over the actors cheekbones abs and other attributes that you begin to wonder if someones going to call Human Resources. With that much objectification going on Robertson is left standing to the side waiting for some attention from either her co-star or her cinematographer. Eastwood is of course Clints son -- the profiles a giveaway to say nothing of the incipient crinkles in both his voice and his forehead -- but hes not the only legacy in the cast. Huston is the grandson of John and Chaplin is the daughter of Geraldine and the granddaughter of Charlie. The latter two give performances that go a long way toward making you wish their story had been the focus of the film. (The 79-year-old Alda talented as he is doesnt quite sell the fact that hes playing a character who has to be at least 93.) Also Read Scott Eastwood Joins Suicide Squad Overall ""The Longest Ride"" feels cloying and contrived; the only time its unpredictable is when the plot takes a turn so utterly unbelievable that admittedly no one would see it coming. Its the kind of movie where someone who loves contemporary art in the 1940s (as Ruth does) is visionary and progressive but someone who loves it today (as Sophia does) is a dupe and a sucker. If youre moved by Ruth and Iras lifelong love of art check out the 2008 documentary ""Herb and Dorothy"" about a real-life couple who amass a collection comparable to the one featured in ""The Longest Ride."" And if you want to see a genuinely moving romance based on a Nicholas Sparks novel well you may just have to dust off that DVD of ""The Notebook"" yet again.
