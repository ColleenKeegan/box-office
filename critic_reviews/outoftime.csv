Stars drawing power and a reasonable number of audience-pleasing sex-and-crime tight spots indicate respectable midrange biz for this MGM release. A tasty if wildly far-fetched thriller ""Out of Time"" proves far stronger in its characterizations than in developing genuine suspense. Welcome reunion of Denzel Washington with ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" director Carl Franklin sees the actor displaying great cool under extreme pressure as a small-town Florida cop forced to dig himself out of a very deep hole of well-intentioned lies and deceit. Stars drawing power and a reasonable number of audience-pleasing sex-and-crime tight spots indicate respectable midrange biz for this MGM release. Dave Collards pulpy original script trades in the sort of exorbitant predicaments that often characterized B noirs of the late 40s outrageous conceits concocted with the single purpose of putting the characters through the wringer as frequently and uncomfortably as possible. Much of the fun comes from watching the victims squirm like bugs caught in a web then narrowly escape through their ingenuity or in lesser examples preposterous deus ex machina plot resolutions. The problem with such stories lies in making the viewer buy them in the first place and in ""Out of Time"" its much easier to believe in the characters and their relationships than it is to believe in what they actually do. Its very easy to accept for example that good-looking easy-going Matt Lee Whitlock (Washington) has everything under control in sleepy Banyan Key and is able to use his position as police chief to slip around with his high school sweetheart Ann Merai (Sanaa Lathan) without her bad seed husband Chris (Dean Cain) knowing about it. Its similarly simple to go along with the idea that when Ann Merai is diagnosed with cancer and is told she has perhaps six months to live Matt takes time out to help her. What becomes hard to take however is Matts decision to give nearly 500000 hes recovered in a drug bust to Ann Merai so she can go to Switzerland for experimental treatment in the belief that hell get the money back as the beneficiary of her will. Its even more difficult to go along with the idea that when Ann Merai and Chris home burns to the ground leaving charred bodies inside and Matt has been seen snooping around shortly before the blaze the cop can cover his tracks before his estranged wife Alex (Eva Mendes) the officer who just happens to be assigned to the case gets hip to what hes been up to. Generosity injected with recklessness rather than stupidity makes Matt commit his blunder. It takes quick thinking and lightning moves for Matt to stay one step ahead of Alex who will have to arrest him for arson and murder if she puts the pieces together and the DEA which suddenly wants its drug-bust booty. Under severe time pressure Matt has to figure out what happened to Ann Merai and the cash track down her doctor cover up incriminating phone records hoodwink Alex without raising her suspicion battle a baddie while dangling from a hotel balcony and deal with some truths that are distinctly demoralizing. As smoothly played by Washington Matt does all this practically without breaking a sweat. Thesp creates a character whos accustomed to getting his way even if hes always played for modest stakes until now; with his exception of his wife having left him Matt has been able to control things and make them work to his advantage so even his suddenly dire circumstances dont faze him to the point of panic or hysteria. Pics fundamental problem however is that the dilemma seems so contrived that when the script tightens the vise true tension doesnt develop. Theres a certain amusement and sense of curiosity created by the spectacle of a man putting his neck in a noose tightening it himself kicking away the stool hes standing on and still managing to survive but a sense of dread and genuine jeopardy is missing. After a melodramatic climax ending tidies things up rather too neatly and rosily. All the same individual scenes are craftily handled such as some sexual charades between Matt and Ann Merai in the hot opening and a tense innuendo-laden barroom standoff between Matt and Chris. The sultry Florida locations suggest a constant threat lurking behind the languid surfaces. Displaying his customary strength with thesps Franklin draws excellent work from Lathan who sizzles in her intimate scenes but also makes Ann Merai perfectly opaque when required. Mendes strikes attitudes as needed but there isnt much sense of a complete character underneath. Cain is credible in the unexpected role of the abusive suspicious husband. As Matts increasingly indispensable sidekick John Billingsley delivers variable comic relief. Tech contributions are sturdy rather than slick.

"Languorous cops in Out of Time Slate Sign In Sign Up Languorous cops in Out of Time Languorous cops in Out of Time Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 3 2003 717 PM Dead Calm Washington is the cats pajamas in Out of Time. By David Edelstein Lathan and Washington pause for a beat in Time Does anyone take a big ripe close-up better than Denzel Washington? Its not just that hes well lets face it a beautiful man. Its that theres so much teasing in his stillness. He knows hes the cats pajamas and theres a faint whiff of entitlement in the economy of his movements and the deliberateness of his manner. Maybe a touch of resentment too for the insults he had to endure on his way to movie stardom Nowadays Washington wont be rushed. Advertisement In the first 45 minutes of Out of Time (MGM) the star and the director Carl Franklin act as if they have all the time in the world. Washington plays Matt Lee Whitlock chief of police in Banyan Key a small town not too far from Miami. Before the credits he makes his leisurely rounds then reclines on his office chair sipping a beer. He takes a call from the dishy Anne Merai Harrison (Sanaa Lathan) reporting a prowler outside; when he shows up at her bungalow the two playact a scene that makes the mock rape near the start of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) seem polite. This easy sultry life appears to suit Whitlock--and Washington--just dandy. If youve seen Franklin and Washingtons last collaboration the marvelously languorous Walter Mosley adaptation Devil in a Blue Dress (1995) you might be prepared for a careful deliberate whodunit in which vibe trumps the mechanics of the plot. Thats the prevailing tone here low and slow. Its set by Whitlocks melancholy as he contemplates life without his soon-to-be ex-wife Alex (Eva Mendes) now a Miami-based detective and by his sadness when he learns that his married lover Anne Merai has terminal cancer. Whitlock keeps everything--even Anne Merais abusive husband (Dean Cain) whos beginning to suspect an extramarital affair--beautifully contained. You would hardly guess that 45 or so minutes into Out of Time the tempo is going to change--and that the fun will be watching the unflappable star as he breathlessly dashes from place to place trying to catch up with the bad guys and elude the cops. Its a great ride. The tight clever script by Dave Collard owes a lot to the thriller No Way Out (1987) and its superior predecessor The Big Clock (1948) Each revolves around a man helping to run an investigation that he knows is going to lead ultimately to him--and must frantically keep his own team from finding out how deep hes in. In this case the principal investigator is Whitlocks ex Alex and the elegance with which Collard and Franklin have their hero charging in and out of offices stairways and--this being the 21st century--searching computer files while trying to maintain his composure (his ex would notice quickly if somethings off) would get a grinning salute from a master farceur like Feydeau. Theyve also given Whitlock a slobby beer-swilling sardonic sidekick Chae (John Billingsley) whose affection for his master is half Walter Brennan half Gollum hilarious but just creepy enough to keep you on guard. I reckon 90 of the movies 106 minutes are thriller heaven. The windup alas isnt in the same league Both humdrum and confusingly staged it pales beside the volcanic climaxes of Franklins OneFalse Move (1992) and Devil in a Blue Dress. Still I love those huge close-ups of Washington with Theo van de Sandes camera slightly cocked and the image suffused in Everglades colors and bric-a-brac. The tightness of the frame is like the tightness of the vise in which the hero is caught. And there arent too many faces that could hold that camera as well as Washingtons. You see in his eyes that he needs time he needs space and he needs above all to maintain his preternatural cool. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Its the old story of an innocent man looking guilty of crimes merely because he got mixed up with the wrong gal. Matt Whitlock (Denzel Washington) chief of police in a small Florida town is liked by his constituents. But his personal life is a mess. Although he still loves his ambitious wife (Eva Mendes) a police detective in a larger city she has just left him. And he has become embroiled in a steamy affair with an old flame (Sanaa Lathan) who is now married to a violent ex-football player (Dean Cain). He just happens to be Whitlocks old rival. (Related item See a clip from Out of Time) Matt Whitlock (Denzel Washington) get in hot water after affair with an old flame (Sanaa Lathan). After a brutal double murder Whitlock is compelled to solve the crime quickly to save his own skin. He must stay ahead of his ex-wife who has been called in to head up the investigation as well as his own police force. More about the movie Out of Time   Stars Denzel Washington Eva Mendes Sanaa Lathan Dean Cain Director Carl Franklin Distributor MGM Rating PG-13 for sexual content violence and some language Opens today nationwide One of Times primary problems is the inconsistencies in Whitlocks character. He still pines for his ex yet he risks everything to help the new woman in his life even though hes not all that keen on her. And even though he is shrewd and whip-smart he makes one shockingly dumb move. Even though that stupid action sets in motion the plots big crimes it doesnt jibe with the fast intelligent thinking he has employed in his race against time to solve the murders. Washington is adequate in the role. But playing police chief Whitlock after his tour-de-force performance as the vicious cop in Training Day must feel anticlimactic. And Washingtons previous teaming with director Carl Franklin 1995s Devil in a Blue Dress was an original and inventive thriller. Out of Time seems out of another time and place.

He looks at her like shes his last beer on a hot night and they do exactly what couples do in the opening scenes of this kind of movie sweat glistening and voices low. Its all very ""Body Heat"" which is to say weve seen it all before. Director Carl Franklin back in the mid-90s made a terrific movie with Washington called ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" which brought freshness to the familiar noir style by setting its tale in a predominantly black neighborhood in post-World War II Los Angeles. That movie had a kind of visual jazz to it; jumpy tension glittery jewel-box colors chewy dialogue. And yet it failed at the box office and Franklins work has gotten less interesting since. Which brings us to ""Out of Time"" a well-performed perfectly watchable thriller thats nonetheless as generic as its title. Matt who drinks on the job and doesnt seem especially smart isnt much of a cop or much of a husband -- we quickly learn that the siren in the opening scene (gorgeous Sanaa Lathan) is not his wife. So hes a prime target for a con (which you can see coming if youve got your eyes open) and spends much of the movie trying to extricate himself out of a mess but only getting in deeper. Movie review 1/2 ""Out of Time"" with Denzel Washington Eva Mendes Sanaa Lathan Dean Cain John Billingsley Robert Baker Alex Carter. Directed by Carl Franklin from a screenplay by Dave Collard. 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content violence and some language. Several theaters. Dave Collards screenplay has too many holes in it but Franklin and the cast bring enough style to bump it up a few notches. Washington perfectly controlled as always pulls off the tricky task of playing a character less intelligent than he is; Matt has an ever-so-faint slackening in the jaw and Washington lets us see him thinking just a beat behind everybody else. And former Seattleite John Billingsley brings some welcome (if awkwardly scripted) humor as a sidekick medical examiner. Perhaps ""Out of Time"" represents a gradual return to form for Franklin; its certainly better than the dismal ""High Crimes."" But Id still rather watch ""Devil in a Blue Dress"" again. Maybe Franklin would too.

OUT OF TIME.jpg DENZEL WASHINGTON stars as Chief of Police Matt Lee Whitlock in MGM Pictures suspense thriller OUT OF TIME. Photo HO Cliff-hanger in the Keys / Denzel Washington is riveting as conflicted Florida police chief 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Out of Time Thriller. Starring Denzel Washington Eva Mendes and Sanaa Lathan. Directed by Carl Franklin. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Denzel Washington starts ""Out of Time"" strolling along the coast of one of the Florida Keys with that relaxed and familiar rolling walk of his looking like a man who will not be disturbed. He knows his world knows himself knows all the things that might happen and knows he can handle them all. And of course he knows nothing because that comfortable sense of sureness is exactly whats about to get run through a meat grinder. ""Out of Time"" is a shrewd thriller that takes the time-honored plot about an innocent man wrongfully accused and gives it a film-noir twist. Here our hero is not exactly innocent. Hes a little bit dirty guilty not of murder but of another crime anyone might have committed under the same circumstances. Hes also not accused of anything right away. He just sees where the damaging evidence is pointing and knows that he has only hours to solve the crime and clear himself. He plays Matt a police chief on the Keys who has a safe full of drug money having just completed a major bust. His professional life is comfortable but hes estranged from his wife Alex (Eva Mendes) an ambitious homicide detective and hes having an affair with a married woman Ann (Sanaa Lathan). Her husband is no pushover either but a nasty former NFL player (Dean Cain). Director Carl Franklin and first-time screenwriter Dave Collard make use of every opportunity to crank up the heat and turn up the emotion so that even before the thriller plot has kicked into gear the audience is in the movies grip. The Chiefs affair with Ann is not some tepid dalliance but something so blindingly passionate that it could be the real thing. Her husband is the obvious obstacle to the romance but then another even worse one presents itself. The Chief accompanies Ann to a doctors office and finds out that her cancer has recurred and that she has only six months to live. He didnt even know she was sick. So we have love sex passion and a death sentence -- and not even 20 minutes have gone by. The complications keep coming. Like a song with multiple melodies and sections ""Out of Time"" is generous with its story laying down a highly charged backdrop against which the rest of the action will play. Its only when two murders are committed that the picture reveals its true nature as a tense suspense drama. For most of the movie the audience watches in a state of ever-mounting anxiety as the Chief tries to do two things at once each seemingly impossible. He works to suppress a flood of incoming evidence so that hes not implicated. And he works to find the real killers before hes framed. His task is complicated by the fact that suppressing evidence necessitates being in the office while solving the crime means being in the field. He has to be in two places at once. As the movies example of flawed but relatively decent humanity Washington cuts a sympathetic figure doing his best to present a blank face to his co- workers occasionally breaking into an uneasy smile when he feels cornered. The movie needs an actor who can lie through his teeth without losing the audience and it has that. Washington is surrounded by actors who clearly have been well directed. Mendes as the homicide detective looks at her estranged husband with the steady ungiving gaze that weve seen on the face of every frightening investigator since Edward G. Robinson in ""Double Indemnity."" She is of that breed -- the kind whose mind will not allow for loose ends. We spend most of the movie wondering how much she knows. Also in the eerie smarter-than-he-looks category is John Billingsley as the Chiefs co-worker the medical examiner. Alfred Hitchcock would have cast Hume Cronyn in the role -- a sly character whose surface goofiness is a cover for an unconventional moral nature. But for good or evil? As Anns menacing husband Cain also has some strong moments in particular a barroom scene in which the husband and the Chief talk in hypotheticals but essentially communicate a couple of stressful truths One man is sleeping with the others wife and they both know it. The setting the Gulf Coast in summer adds a sultry atmosphere of living on the edge -- geographically ethically legally. It looks like a good place to feel free and get into trouble.

The tiny gold hoop in Matts ear signals vanity and a certain amorphousness of character. Hes no strong silent hero which will come as a relief to those of us who think that heroes bring out a strain of moral implacability in Washington a severity that began in St. Elsewhere and still pops up periodically (Remember the Titans John Q. Antwone Fisher) as bombast. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Matt is a decent sort but hes smugly dug in a big fish in a pond so tiny that nothing beyond the occasional drug bust seems to ruffle its surface. Hes a touch hapless and easily led by the nose -- and as the movies early scenes suggest by other anatomical parts which leads to his undoing in more ways than one. Out of Time opens more anxious than could possibly be necessary to prove Washingtons studly credentials -- hes as close to a matinee idol as we get these days -- with a conversation between Matt and his married lover Ann (the sultry Sanaa Lathan) that amounts to a rape fantasy followed in short order by two steamy sexual encounters. Separated from his wife Alex (Eva Mendes) a homicide detective Matt is having an affair with Ann right under the nose of her thuggish football player of a husband (Dean Cain) but still carries a torch for his go-getting ex no slouch herself in the smoldering department. Still when Ann reveals she has terminal cancer Matts natural gallantry kicks in. Refusing her offer to make him not her husband the beneficiary of her insurance policy Matt gives Ann a pile of drug money held for collection by ATF agents in the precinct safe so that she can get experimental treatment in Switzerland. After Ann mysteriously vanishes and two hideously deformed bodies show up in the charred remains of Anns house Matt is served with two sets of papers -- his divorce papers and Anns insurance policy which shows that she made him her beneficiary after all. The movies conceit is familiar enough. Even as he joins forces with the lovely Alex to hunt down the true killer Matt must stay one step ahead of each scrap of evidence that points to him as the arsonist and the murderer of his secret lover. Franklin who began his career full of promise with the 1992 sleeper hit One False Move a wonderfully adroit meld of moody emotion and shocking violence seemed to lose his footing for a while after his second film -- the gorgeous Walter Mosley adaptation Devil in a Blue Dress -- bombed. He made the sticky-sweet cancer drama One True Thing and more recently the forgettable Ashley Judd-Morgan Freeman thriller High Crimes. In the long run Out of Time will probably rate as a trifle -- theres more skill than originality in Collards script -- but the movie clips along with a natural warmth and lightness of heart. At its best Franklins work is stylish and headily atmospheric With its throbbing score and swampy carnality Out of Time seduces us deliciously into the overworked proposition that Floridas weather turns everyone into sex maniacs. This is hooey -- in Spike Jonzes Adaptation the case was more plausibly made that it breeds lunatics -- but it is likable hooey and its a joy to behold Washington think with his dick for a change and be rescued by women of something resembling his own color. The movie is casually glamorously multiracial and Washington is great fun but the final glory belongs to actor John Billingsley who plays one of those rumpled minor characters plugged into thrillers to keep you guessing whether theyre light relief or something more sinister and who in a few memorably funny scenes shuffles away with the movie.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm When it comes to the AIDS crisis the movies have all but dropped the ball. So I wish I had kinder things to say about The Event a new film about a Manhattan musician with AIDS who stages his own suicide as well as the wild party that goes with it. AIDS or no AIDS director Thom Fitzgerald has a thing for death Like his 1997 first feature The Hanging Garden The Event is built around a gay man who is dead for much of the movie here with copious flashbacks narrated by those who loved him. The musician Matt Shapiro and Brian the hospice worker who helps him and ends up being dragged into the district attorneys office for his pains are played in an appealingly low key by Canadian actors Don McKellar and Brent Carver. Their ironic gravity is almost immediately undercut by the pack of strenuously kooky friends and family that surrounds them creating a big sloppy mess of none-too-adept situation comedy. Fitzgerald wants it all -- he means to rub our noses in the sordid details of dying from AIDS which is fair enough but he also wants to romanticize it to the hilt and endear both his characters and himself to us. But he lacks both narrative self-control (September 11 is gratuitously shoehorned in with a few images of the twin towers and ground zero) and the manic elan of John Cameron Mitchell and other interpreters of gay urban life. The result is a tonal confusion that detracts from the movies efforts to engage us in a conversation about assisted suicide. Not that the topic is up for serious discussion. Fitzgerald stacks the deck against opponents of assisted suicide a practice that however widespread within and outside the gay community remains an enormously thorny issue -- especially so in this movie since Matt decides to kill himself while hes still relatively healthy. Fitzgerald firmly positions us on the side of the angels which is not necessarily the most interesting place to be If you cant argue the point glibness invariably results. Parker Posey saddled with the thankless task of playing both a moral enemy and the movies framing device is Nic the ambitious young D.A. who despite the fact that her own cancer-stricken father died a lingering and painful death hounds Matts nearest and dearest for information about his suspiciously orderly demise. Hard of face and harder yet of heart Nic is all too clearly headed for a life lesson. But her worst sin is a complete lack of femininity a trait Fitzgerald blindly worships in its most traditional forms whether manifested in mothers sisters or drag queens. All-forgiving unfailingly supportive and never less than elegantly coifed and tailored even while cleaning up her sons shit Lila Shapiro (played by Olympia Dukakis with impressive dignity) is the parent we all want -- and someone who has never existed in this world. Matts hotheaded younger sister even as played by the terrific Sarah Polley is only marginally more believable. The most interesting person in the movie is Matts dissenting older sister Gaby (Joanna P. Adler) the one who must be brought round to the correct point of view. As reasoning this is manipulative -- as filmmaking its dull. OUT OF TIME | Directed by CARL FRANKLIN | Written by DAVE COLLARD | Produced by NEAL H.

Set on the sleepy tropical island of Banyan Key Fla. just down the coconut grove from Miami this is one of those genuine Hitchcockian contraptions in which the hero may not be guilty but hes not quite innocent either. In the act of escaping the predicament fate has laid out for him hes forced to confront - and pay for - his sins. Early on Washingtons Matt Whitlock the Banyan Key chief of police carries on a sultry affair with Ann Merai (Sanaa Lathan) the wife of a local jerk (Dean Cain) whose contempt for him only heightens the tingle of adulterous excitement. Whitlock may be a smooth operator but hes no heartless cad. When it turns out that his lover has been stricken with cancer hes there at her side ready to do anything even if it means raiding a police safe that holds 480000 in confiscated drug money. Whitlock isnt stealing the cash just borrowing it. Since hes doing it to help save a life who could really blame him? Washington in cocksure-lothario mode woos the audience as effortlessly as he does his costar. Its fun to see him go nose to nose with Cain boastfully flaunting his adultery even as he denies it. Washington is so commanding in these scenes that it never occurs to you hes playing a sucker. It would be unfair to give away much of what happens in ""Out of Time"" but suffice it to say that Whitlock ends up investigating a twisted thicket of foul play. He then realizes that the clues have all been set up to point to him. The audience knows hes being framed but with the inquiry under way he has to lie with such split-second frantic cunning that he has the aura of a guilty man - and the fact that he grabbed all of that drug money (even for a compassionate reason) puts him in a moral gray zone. That Whitlock has an estranged wife Alex (Eva Mendes) who has just been promoted to homicide detective only heightens his need to hide. Except that hes hiding in plain sight. ""Out of Time"" may be nothing more (or less) than a nicely paced genre maze but when Washington stands in the police station trying to fake a cool facade even as hes quietly juggling technological tools (computer cell phone fax machine) to make sure that his name doesnt pop up on incriminating phone records were seeing the actor at his peak. He has to look mellow for his fellow cops and at the same time nervous enough to show us what hes really thinking and its that balancing act that lends the movie its hum of tension. ""Out of Time"" has its routine elements but Franklin as a director has spent a decade failing to live up to the promise of ""One False Move"" his 1992 sleeper. The wait Im pleased to report is now over.
