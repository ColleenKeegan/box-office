"The Man With the Iron Fists review Iron fists rusty film | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Man With the Iron Fists review Iron fists rusty filmGood thing RZA does so well as a rapper. His love of martial arts is best expressed in beats and rhymes not in films like The Man With the Iron Fists.Lucy Lui plays a brothel owner in The Man With the Iron Fists.Rapper RZA plays the lead directs narrates and co-wrote The Man With the Iron Fists.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 2 2012The Man With the Iron Fists (out of 4)Starring Russell Crowe RZA Lucy Liu and Rick Yune. Directed by RZA. At GTA theatres. 96 minutes.When The Man With the Iron Fists mercifully ends rapper RZAs narrating blacksmith quotes a Chinese proverb ""Where theres iron theres rust.""That pretty much sums up this clanking martial arts monstrosity although rust implies that there was something going on to begin with. And theres little happening here except slavish imitation and embarrassing hackwork.Article Continued BelowA combination labor of love (by genre-adoring RZA) and contractual obligation (it opened without critical previews) the film fails on all fronts most fatally in the visuals. The incoherent action scenes look as if they were shot in the dark and edited with a dull samurai blade.Speaking of contractual obligation whatever possessed Russell Crowe to be part of this? He plays a blade-wielding Brit psychopath called Jack Knife which sounds like a good role for him. But his lack of enthusiasm suggests hes on some kind of court-ordered community service duty or perhaps currying favor with Quentin Tarantino billed as the films ""presenter.""To give RZA his due theres no doubting his enthusiasm for the kung fu and ""wire fu"" films of his youth when the former Robert Fitzgerald Diggs (his real name) would haunt grindhouse theatres. His love of the genre carried over to the Wu-Tang the hip-hop outfit he leads and hes had small acting roles in films with kung fu themes.But loving films and being able to make them are two very different things and RZA just isnt ready for prime time in the multiple tasks hes assigned himself director (first time) lead actor narrator co-writer (with Eli Roth who also produces) and co-composer (with Howard Drossin).Set in 19th Century China the highly derivative story clashes a menagerie of warring clans - named after lions wolves hyenas rodents and more - in a place called Jungle Village a town with no pity and no originality either.Theyre all brutally engaged in acts of violence and vengeance inside and out of a brothel run by Lucy Liu. Its hard to separate heroes from villains amidst the gloomy and badly choreographed fight scenes most of which suffer from claustrophobic overuse of close-ups.Theres little reason to raise a fist for any of the characters including RZAs laconic Blacksmith who is taught mystic wisdoms by the proverbial Buddhist sages and who must learn to overcome his titular handicap caused by an evildoer.Theres also not much fun in The Man With the Iron Fists unless you count laughing at dialogue containing such hoary phrases as ""Ill see you in hell"" and ""I raised you as a son.""Good thing RZA does so well as a rapper. His love of martial arts is best expressed in beats and rhymes not in films.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

These elements are accounted for in RZAs first film the 19th-century-China-set The Man With the Iron Fists. The director plays the blacksmith of factious violence-torn Jungle Village which is invaded by brigands who have absconded with the governors gold as well as outsiders with grudges to nurse Englishman Mr. Knife (Russell Crowe) and Zen Yi (Rick Yune). As Iron Fists gets rolling you immediately have the sense of watching a movie made by someone who has no immediate expectation of making another and has consequently decided to throw in every bit of chop-socky business all at once cluttering the screen with all manner of outlandish weapon-accessories superpowered characters with axiomatic names (Brass Body the Gemini Killers) and calligraphy writ with arterial spray. As a narrative it is about as cohesive as Bobby Digital in Stereo the action scenes are often too cluttered for legibility and curious to say of a movie made by a musician the film has broad swaths without tempo. But if Iron Fists is sometimes badly made it is refreshingly badly made. It has a homemade charm that comes from a sense of having gestated in a lifelong obsession A flashback showing RZAs blacksmith escaping his plantation to wash up on the shores of China gets at Wu-Tangs essential cross-cultural tension curiously touching in its suggestion of a young Robert Diggs gaining a sense of personal nobility (and a bowdlerized primer on Buddhism) through the conduit of duped Golden Harvest VHS tapes.

Take ""The Man with the Iron Fists"" the first film directed by RZA founding father of legendary hip-hop combo the Wu-Tang Clan. From the name of his group to the look of his movie this is a guy who has clearly watched a whole lot of vintage martial-arts movies. If I were on ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" and my multiple-choice answers were down to ""Five Deadly Venoms"" and ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"" this is the guy Id want for my lifeline. Id even hire him to create one of those fake trailers in ""Grindhouse"" since he clearly appreciates the pacing and the acting style of the Shaw Brothers kung fu classics of the 1970s. Instead RZA hooked up with ""Grindhouse""-meisters Eli Roth (who co-wrote ""Fists"") and Quentin Tarantino (who ""presents"" this new film) to create this full-on feature-length homage. The blood spurts the knives shoot out and the fists fly -- but ""The Man with the Iron Fists"" never takes off. As the old saying goes RZA knows the words but he doesnt know the music. Hes also not actor enough to tackle the pivotal role hes given himself as Blacksmith in Jungle Village a tiny hamlet beset by various warring clans. Blacksmith just wants to liberate his lover Lady Silk (Jamie Chung) from the brothel owned by Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu) but instead he must forge weapons for members of the Lion and Fox clans. The Lions have problems of their own -- engaged by the emperor to protect a shipment of gold second-in-command Silver Lion (Byron Mann) assassinates Gold Lion (Kuan Tai Chen) with the intent of stealing the gold. Word of his treachery reaches Gold Lions son Zen Yi (Rick Yune) who returns to Jungle Village seeking vengeance. Meanwhile mysterious Englishman Jack Knife (Russell Crowe) shows up at Madam Blossoms with a vast array of appetites -- and an even more varied collection of weapons. Word is that RZA originally had a four-hour cut that he hoped to release in two parts ""Kill Bill""-style but instead was forced to slash his vision down to 90 minutes. That might excuse the choppiness of the plot and exposition but it doesnt explain why the fighting scenes are so listless and the acting (with the notable exception of Liu and Crowe who were smart enough to create their own amusement) so stiff. Regarding the latter the performances arent even bad in an homage-to-the-bad-acting-of-the-original way; theyre just dull and not ironically so. As for the action sequences the choreography and camera movements suggest 1970s chop-socky but they are simulacra under glass -- its like watching a bad high school production of ""West Side Story"" where the Jets and the Sharks are clearly never going to hurt each other. (The midnight audience that watched the film with me didnt whoop or laugh a single time during these gory but bloodless melees.) The one fresh idea that ""The Man with the Iron Fists"" has -- namely to contrast the 18th century settings with contemporary hip-hop music -- is quickly abandoned; after the first one or two fight scenes were back to very generic scoring. The film also might have scored points for allowing the African-American Blacksmith character to exist in feudal China without explaining how he got there...but no they explain it in a tedious flashback that adds little except an all-too-brief cameo by an exploitation legend. If RZA wanted to host a retrospective of kung fu classics Id be first in line. But his admiration for the genre doesnt translate into capably executing it himself. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

And outta control they are. When they write the book on remix culture well they wont write a book will they? When they assemble the YouTube mashup on remix culture one has to imagine that therell be a nice section dedicated to the RZA. As someone who spends a great deal of his time avoiding hip-hop (it just isnt my thing) even I am familiar with his work and not in that ""Oh God wont that jeep turn down the bass hes making the whole intersection quake"" kind of way. For ""The Man With the Iron Fists"" RZA (the Pete Townshend of the Wu Tang Clan to put it in classic rock terms) has a remarkable knack for creating soundscapes that are both toe-tapping and hallucinatory incorporating evocative stingers from old movies as well as microthemes hidden in old jazz piano runs. His music has always been cinematic and thats without even addressing the lyrical content. A love-letter to the grindhouse martial arts classics of the Shaw Brothers is unquestionably the right first foray into filmmaking for this man. Starring as ""the Blacksmith"" (and later the titular character) RZA is an outsider living in the mythical Jungle City a timeless and slightly magical place at the mercy of various warring tribes. Trouble begins when the Emperor has to send a shipment of gold to - Oh wait before we get to that theres the opening credits. A bunch of people (Im not sure we ever find out who they were) are beating the hell out of one another to the tune of the Wu Tang Clans ""Shame on a Nigga"" and when a kick or punch lands theres a freeze frame and the image turns to a drawing as the names come up. Its awesome. Okay so the Emperor has to send a shipment of gold up north so he entrusts Silver Lion (something of an Asian David Bowie type) but theres a double-cross. Then the Gemini Warriors (a sort of two-person Middle Kingdom Pinkertons) have the gold and well by the time they get to Jungle City theres going to be a throw-down. Of course the X-Blade (whose suit contains Captain Caveman-esque pocket universes from which knives can always be jettisoned) will be there and hell be looking for revenge. The Englishman Jack Knife (Russell Crowe) will be there too and while he claims drinking and whoring are his primary business we know he has a deeper goal. ""The Man With the Iron Fists"" is the type of movie that feels like you are always coming in half-way through even if you watch it from the beginning. As an exercise in genre this is the highest compliment. A true grindhouse film should never be the sole focus of the evenings entertainment. Back in the day you stumbled into the theater to get out of the rain. Today you are rolling with your buds checking out this movie before you hit the party you were mostly invited to. In ""Fists"" the action scenes are gory absurd and terrific but during the talking parts please by all means ruffle through your bag to find that smuggled tall boy or run out to the lobby to get Twizzlers. Theres an unending group of gangs and villains introduced but in time it whittles down to a three vs. three. (Lucy Liu is involved too and is the only woman in the picture allowed to be more than a cooing prostitute.) The boss fights are of the type to inspire audience participation and so long as the folks in your crowd have a pulse therell be a few hearty ""ooh""s and ""yeah""s. The specifics of the plot are about as convoluted as tax code but the big beats (get gold and/or revenge) are simple enough for even the most highly intoxicated Saturday night group to follow. There are even a few quality jokes in there. ""The Man With the Iron Fists"" may not however be quite the genre pastiche you are expecting. Despite Quentin Tarantinos stamp of approval it is no ""Kill Bill"" rich in signifiers from all of film history. It is fairly straightforward albeit unrestrained with the arterial sprays and innovative weaponry. (Crowes gun-knife or maybe it is a knife-gun is particularly nifty.) Sadly there isnt quite as much music as you may be hoping for (RZA beats are TOO controlled) but when the soundtrack bolts up it is greatly welcomed. And the closing credits are almost as cool as the opening ones. Its only been a few hours and Im already forgetting ""The Man With the Iron Fists."" But I did have a big grin on my face as I kicked back and watched a bunch of people kill each other for no discernible reason. Its certainly not for everyone but if your interests lie in hip-hop or martial arts Id dare call this one you cant miss.

Congratulations I guess but I think if Per Se really wanted to serve Salisbury steak from a frozen Swanson TV dinner it could. Why would it? Wu-Tang Clan rapper RZA directs co-writes (with Eli Roth of ""Hostel"") and stars in this martial-arts saga set in olden days China. After the assassination of local kingpin Gold Lion the old mans son Zen Yi (Rick Yune) seeks revenge against the treacherous usurpers Silver Lion and Bronze Lion (Byron Mann Cung Le) with many limbs to be lopped off in the process. Also interested in vengeance is an escaped American slave and blacksmith (RZA) who after getting both arms cut off remakes himself Iron Man-style with help from a mysterious British soldier (Russell Crowe) who enjoys disemboweling anyone who starts an argument with him. For the ladies theres a lethal madam (Lucy Liu) who goes all ""Kill Bill"" on the bad guys and the blacksmiths hooker girlfriend (Jamie Chung). She tries to take out the villainous Brass Body (Dave Bautista) who is impervious to the many whirling blades and crossbow arrows flying through the film and does a lot of growling and flexing. Heads depart shoulders arteries spurt and the actors speak in the affectless way of amateurs who are reading through lines they have just been handed in order to sound just like the hacks who dubbed in the voices on the Hong Kong flicks back in the 70s. You can sense Quentin Tarantino who ""presents"" this movie (whatever that means) getting really excited about all the chop-socky action and corny dialogue but Tarantinos genuine appreciation for bad 1970s movies is something I am unable to fathom. Have you ever tried to sit through the original ""The Inglorious Bastards""? It makes ""The A-Team"" look like Shakespeare. Weve seen this kind of spoof before in the fake trailers inserted into ""Grindhouse"" which proved that a dead-on parody of an exploitation movie can be hilarious in a brief blast. ""Machete"" a feature-length spinoff of one of those trailers added ironic wit but ""Iron Fists"" plods along without any such tweaks. At 96 minutes it is exactly 93 1/2 minutes too long. If theyre going to put this artifact in theaters theyd better charge 1973 grindhouse prices a dollar a ticket.

Writer/director/star RZA is mesmerizing and Russell Crowe is having fun.November 01 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""The Man With the Iron Fists"" is a wildly whirling martial arts spectacle with an endless array of exotic knives a penchant for Zen philosophizing and an unquenchable thirst for blood. It may just be one of the best bad movies ever.I do not confer such infamy lightly but the flaws are far more amusing than infuriating and its director/writer/star RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame is mesmerizing. There is nothing subtle about the film including its abject devotion to classic kung fu fare. It has the backing of another martial arts fanatic in Quentin Tarantino though ""Fists"" never gets close to the directors own brilliant kung fu homage ""Kill Bill.""Through the morass you can see that RZA has good instincts for grand theater while the filmmaking itself is raw and in serious need of refining. Its why the look of the film a a blend of French Baroque and ancient China a is quite beautiful and the martial arts choreography intriguing in its excess. But the first-time filmmaker doesnt yet know how to handle his actors and the performances are terribly uneven as a result.PHOTOS Scenes from The Man with the Iron FistsThe one thing ""Fists"" does frequently if not always well is spill blood and expose guts. Im not sure Ive ever seen someones throat ripped out so literally. Meanwhile the blood is so thin it seems more like a massive black cherry Kool-Aid slick than the very life leaking out of the fallen.The screenplay which RZA wrote with Eli Roth another Tarantino disciple is a complicated one with a dizzying number of warring clans in feudal China. An assassination a power grab and some gold digging get things roiling. For reasons that completely elude me all of the action that follows takes place in Jungle Village known for its ""house of pleasure"" the Pink Blossom run by Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu). The enigmatic Blacksmith (RZA) spends his days fashioning exotic weaponry for the various clans. His nights are wiled away with one of the Blossoms fetching young pretties Lady Silk (Jamie Chung).The Blacksmith a the man who will one day have the iron fists a is the central figure in the film and the narrator as well. RZA has a silky smooth baritone that would be excellent for bedtime stories so much does it lull you into thinking you will be able to make sense of things. The plot goes seriously off-course in filling in the Blacksmiths back story which involves slavery a ship named Destiny and monks.The extreme action is well-choreographed and comes courtesy of the Chinese clans that square off over the stolen gold. The factions are named after the animals they favor a the Lion Hyena and Wolf clans with a couple of Gemini thrown in to further confuse things. The force for good is little more than the one-man show of Zen Yi/The X-Blade (Rick Yune). Theres a long line in the villain column most notably Poison Dagger (Daniel Wu) plus the many Lions and their fabulous manes a props to the makeup and hair folks for this hoot. Bronze Lion (Cung Le) and Silver Lion (Byron Mann) are the memorable ones.The whole metal thing is something the film just cant shake. One particularly lethal dude is called Brass Body (David Bautista); you can guess why.Somehow the Blacksmith gets on the wrong side of the clans and they break from breaking one another to punish the smithy. Russell Crowe as an Aussie mercenary named Jack Knife ultimately helps save the Blacksmith and outfit him with those fists of iron. Suffice it to say the process is excruciatingly painful and the camera is merciless with director of photography Chan Chi Ying not shy about going in for a close-up and delivering one of the films more gruesome moments.Any way you slice it a and with all those knives there is a lot of slicing a ""The Man With the Iron Fists"" really is bad to the bone. When it goes for camp it falls short. When it edges toward serious it slips. There is such a twinkle in Crowes eyes when he turns up you get the feeling hes in on a joke the rest of us arent privy to.If youre in a kung fu fighting mood and have some cash to burn ""The Man With the Iron Fists"" can be something of a guilty pleasure. But RZA should keep in mind that next time around bad wont cut it.betsy.sharkeylatimes.comThe Man With the Iron FistsMPAA rating R for bloody violence strong sexuality language and brief drug useRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO A guide to upcoming movies The Envelope Awards Insider PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESRussell Crowe Kung fu movie star?November 2 2012Wu-Tang Clan references run deep in RZAs Iron FistsNovember 1 2012Eli Roth Iron Fists will push kung-fu in character...September 25 2012RZAs new rap filmmakerJanuary 3 2010The soundtrack to the RZAs lifeJune 8 2005MORE STORIES ABOUTMartial ArtsMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-man-with-the-iron-fists-review-rza-20121102,0,6700979.story",200,themanwiththeironfists7,themanwiththeironfists,latimes

As endearing as it is exhausting ""The Man With the Iron Fists"" bears strong resemblance to a hyperactive puppy sloppy scatterbrained manic and migraine-inducing but possessing an earnest sense of excitement. Working with actors a crew and resources of a far higher caliber than his level of filmmaking expertise would seem to countenance first-time writer-director-star the RZA turns in a postmodern martial-arts experiment thats equal parts Shaw Brothers Adult Swim and amphetamine-fueled student film. For an utterly bonkers vanity project its more fun than it ought to be and should bring a small yet sufficient ruckus to the B.O. If any figure from hip-hops golden age was going to make the leap from rhymes to reels the Wu-Tang Clans founder rapper producer and overall shogun certainly seems the most obvious. Leading eight of his disparate compatriots to phenomenal success in the 1990s RZA served as the great Staten Island collectives unquestioned auteur composing all its early music maintaining a consistent aesthetic and mythology and ably stage-managing a large group of eccentric unpredictable talents. Yet translating this relevant experience to film is hardly a seamless switch even when the subject matter is as compatible as it is here. Assisted by mentor Quentin Tarantino (for whom he scored ""Kill Bill"" and who gets a ""presented by"" credit here) and co-scripter Eli Roth RZA at times seems too excited to be behind the camera. A giddy prologue sets a grainy kung fu throwdown to the Wu-Tangs ""Shame on a Nigga"" whereupon RZAs voiceover lays out a rather simple premise in nearly incomprehensible fashion. Set in a 19th-century Chinese hamlet where naturally all relevant business banking and governance are conducted at the local brothel the film concerns a humble escaped-slave blacksmith (RZA) who dreams of whisking his girlfriend (Jamie Chung) away from her obligations with the local madam (Lucy Liu). Things are complicated by the arrival of a gaggle of unsavories seeking a treasure of some sort most problematically a sinister crime lord (Cung Le) and his hulking thug (David Bautista) with eyes on the Blacksmiths girl and a brass body capable of dispensing severe punishment. But help arrives from a mysterious knife-toting British hedonist (Russell Crowe) and a be-daggered mercenary (Rick Yune) out to protect his own neck. For the first half-hour nearly every shot seems to contain a dramatic reveal or zoom; things are frenetically mashed together with scarce lockdowns or breathers to establish a concrete sense of space or mood. The finished film was apparently chopped down from a four-hour initial cut and RZAs urgency to incorporate all his favorite footage at the expense of coherence or pacing is obvious and overwhelming. Yet the stewy overheated enthusiasm eventually proves contagious and by the time the pic finally finds its groove toward the end -- subdividing the screen into comicbook-like panels and splashing slow-motion rivers of blood in graceful patterns across the camera -- an anything-goes midnight-movie mood triumphs. Though hes notched memorable supporting roles in the past RZA is too withdrawn an onscreen presence to carry the film even when hes outfitted with the titular bodily modification. Fortunately hes supported by a fierce assembly of rock-solid pros who let loose with high degrees of good-humor especially Le who speaks English in a hysterical approximation of the clenched-jawed dubbing of vintage kung fu pics and Crowe who smirkingly goes for broke to an extent that viewers havent seen from him since well ... ever. Though the script is of tangential importance here its inability to stick to a consistent tone can be groan-worthy especially when RZAs voiceover breaks from its zenlike contemplativeness into lines like ""These motherfuckers had a Gatling gun and more bullets than China has rice."" The score from RZA and Howard Drossin is wonderful with touches of Ennio Morricone and found sound even if the films reliance on anachronistic soundtrack music from Isaac Hayes and Kanye West can distract.

TWITTER RZAs directorial debut starring Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu feels like both a lavish vanity project and an earnest attempt to deliver a compendium of cool hand-to-hand combat set pieces. A boiling pot of wild martial arts moves culled from dozens (maybe hundreds) of violent Asian action extravaganzas as sifted through a Tarantino-esque fanboy prism The Man With the Iron Fists feels like both a lavish vanity project and an earnest attempt to deliver a compendium of cool hand-to-hand combat set pieces. The vogue for kung fu elaborate wire work and fancy blade flashing seems rather past its due-date at this point making director RZAs realization of his childhood enthusiasms feel a bit quaint but you certainly cant say its dull or uneventful. Still in the U.S. at least its hard to see this Universal release breaking out beyond hardcore action fans. PHOTOS 7 Music to Movie Directors Michael Bay David Fincher Spike Jonze Hip-hop megastar RZA of Wu-Tang Clan grew up as Robert Fitzgerald Diggs watching Asian martial arts films at New York neighborhood theaters in the late 70s and 80s and his first big-time outing as a director-writer-star feels like the result of notes he might have scribbled about the wildest most outrageous action scenes he saw in movies like Fists of Double K The 36th Chamber of Shaolin Godfathers of Hong Kong and anything else he could track down from the Shaw Brothers. Tarantino on board as presenter entered the mix when RZA handled the score for Kill Bill Vol. 1 and spent a month in China watching him shoot which led to the connection with Eli Roth a co-writer and co-producer here. A cocktail blending aspects of the Chinese wuxia martial arts genre and the Japanese jidaigeki itinerant samurai/craftsman/peasant format the Shanghai-shot Iron Fists features more lavish production values than most of its precursors as well as an odd but appealing stew of international actors including Russell Crowe as a British mercenary Lucy Liu as an all-knowing brothel madame World Wrestling Entertainment star David Bautista as an invincible warrior and RZA as Blacksmith a former slave who crafts exotic weapons for one and all. The aptly named Jungle Village is like a Chinese Deadwood the baddest town on the frontier where anything goes and outlaws roam free. The simple setup has a clan chief betrayed and killed for his horde of gold by his sadistic militia leader Silver Lion (streaked-hair rock star-type Byron Mann). Rampaging and killing as they please Silver Lion and his animalistic top fighter Bronze Lion (Cung Le) threaten to bring Jungle Village to its knees but handsome rightful heir Zen Yi The X-Blade (Rick Yune) Crowes hedonistic Jack Knife and Blacksmith form a Leone-esque ad hoc band of loners each whom has his own reasons for getting back at Silver Lion. VIDEO Man With the Iron Fists Star Dave Bautista on Why He Felt Bad for RZA Zap Pow Wham opening credits set the tone for the wild and sometimes splattery proceedings. This is the sort of film where the main characters are defined first and foremost by what type of weaponry they favor for Jack Knife its a fancy combo of gutting knife and pistol; The X-Blade sports a sleek outfit concealing an endless array of sharp objects and projectiles beneath black leather; and Blacksmith fashions for himself forearms and hands of spiked metal which would qualify him as a uniquely qualified opponent for the mega-fisted title character in the simultaneous release Wreck-It-Ralph. Within this format RZA and Roth are free to concoct any sort of mayhem they can invent or lift from their extensive memory banks. Very few minutes go by without some sort of combat; theres plenty of spinning running/jumping up walls and through the air skull bashing eyes and guts popping prostitutes catching fighters in a black widow-like web sword clashing gory puncturing and elaborate demolition of buildings. Most distinctive perhaps is the already rock-hard torso of Bautistas aptly named Brass Body automatically turning to metal when struck rather like an ancient Greek fighter in a vintage Ray Harryhausen effects epic. Its all sufficiently well done and amusing enough to satisfy the appetites of fans who mainline this sort of thing but it also sports a concocted second-hand feel common to this sort of throwback homage when it lacks the stylistic inspiration and imaginative flair for genre reinvention of a Leone or Tarantino. In this sense RZA seems more the dedicated student than a new heir apparent. VIDEO Man With the Iron Fists Stars Reveal the Scene That Intimidated Quentin Tarantino Fun does come from the wildly imaginative weapons designs Lius crafty manipulations of everyone who sets foot in her house of pleasure Crowes sporting holiday in a role that would have been relished by his late Gladiator co-star Oliver Reed the cramming of so many Asian martial arts hallmarks/cliches into one scenario and the weird conjunction of Chinese setting and mostly hip-hop-style soundtrack. Production values are certainly better than those on most of the films RZA idolized in his youth while his visual handling is more industrious than stylish.

Scott Bowles USA TODAY 613 p.m. EDT November 1 2012RZAs directorial debut is heavy on bloody kung fu action...and light on just about everything else.RZA stars in his directorial debut The Man with the Iron Fists which comes across more music video than motion picture.(Photo Chan Kam Chuen Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourStars Russell Crowe Lucy Liu RZA; Director RZARated R; runtime 1 hour 35 minutes; opens Friday nationwideTheres a line in The Man with the Iron Fists ( 1/2 stars out of four; rated R; opens nationwide Friday) that becomes self-fulfilling prophecy for this campy laugher ""A dog that lives in a palace is still a dog.""So it goes for this martial arts bloodfest from hip hop star RZA whose directorial debut goes a long way in demonstrating that a bad movie with big names is still a bad movie. Just prettier.Under the banner of ""Quentin Tarantino Presents (though Tarantino takes no producing or writing credit) and starring Russell Crowe and Lucy LiuFists aims to be another homage to the kung fu films of yore. And while the air is filled with sound effects behind every punch Fists plays more like a 95-minute music video underscored by drum machines and writhing models.Set in 19th-century China (though hip sunglasses American slang and frosted tips abound) Fists centers on a mysterious blacksmith (RZA) caught between warring factions in Jungle Village.As tensions between the clans mount we meet the irascible emissary Jack Knife (Crowe) a big sponsor of the local brothel and Madam Blossom (Liu) who runs it. They share some sexual dialogue but no chemistry.The film has beautifully choreographed moments and the action sequences wont disappoint any fans of slow-motion fistfights and arteries that gush like fire hydrants.MORE Latest news reviews amp; coverage of all things film at USA TODAY MoviesAlas Fists has a tin ear. Written by RZA and Hostel director Eli Roth the film doesnt have enough tension to be taken seriously or enough laughs to be taken lightly.One of the primary villains for instance is Brass Body (mixed martial arts star Dave Bautista) a man with cannons for arms and a tree stump for a neck. But Fists cant help but take every character over the top -- thus Brass Body has learned to transform his skin into a sheet of metal. The blacksmith too works some metallurgic magic with brass knuckles.Crowe and Liu are fine though tasked with chewing any scenery within reach. RZA has the emotional range of a jujitsu mat.Say this for Fists Its slick and hip down to the soundtrack. The closing title sequence set to RZA and The Black Keys Baddest Man Alive is worth sitting through.But it seems to take a long time getting there. For all the high-caliber voices chiming in on Fists they strike a single note Woof.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Produced by Quentin Tarantino and starring Lucy Liu and Russell Crowe The Man with the Iron Fists marks the directorial debut of RZA best known as a member of the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/RwGGp6",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/XWE5279JKg0/,200,themanwiththeironfists10,themanwiththeironfists,usatoday
