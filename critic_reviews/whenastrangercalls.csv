Simon Wests recidivist teen horror movie revisits the original stretches out the first 20 minutes to feature length and likewise outstays its welcome by about 60 minutes. Also crucially it ignores the fact that Waltons landline-based twist ending makes no sense in an age of mobile phones. Have you checked the children? enquires a mystery male caller repeatedly driving 16-year-old babysitter Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) out of her mind and eventually out of the house. Her overused mobile phone confiscated by her angry parents the helpless Jill can only check the doors and windows and reset the fancy alarm system. Meanwhile shes chased around her employers glass-heavy house and shadow-filled designer garden by Wests relentless Steadicam and hand-held cameras. If youve seen either Black Christmas or Halloween theres nothing new here the hyped-up score keeps telling us we ought to be scared but the suspense feels mechanical and fake.

"When a Stranger Calls | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; when-a-stranger-calls ) When a Stranger Calls (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Spoiler Alert This movie contains spoilers for those who havent seen the 1979 movie or the trailer for the 2006 version (which gives away what Im going to reveal). Something went terribly wrong during the production of When a Stranger Calls. This movie should have been a tense nail-biter possibly a worthy successor to John Carpenters Halloween. With the right claustrophobic tone and escalating tension When a Stranger Calls could have been brilliant. But as helmed by second-rate director Simon West who understands a lot about cheap shocks and nothing about suspense and who hasnt met a horror movie clichA(c) he eschews its as emasculated and lifeless as any recent ""scary"" movie. When a Stranger Calls is a remake of the 1979 movie of the same name - or at least a reworking of the first 20 minutes of it. Fans have long praised the earlier films taut opening act then expressed dismay at where the narrative went from there. For the remake screenwriter Jake Wade Wall decides to expand those first 20 minutes into a full-length feature. In the process he piles on the clichA(c)s and contrivances (think that car will start on the first trya|) until we feel like were watching a ""greatest hits"" compilation of stupid things people do in horror and slasher movies. The setup is as classic as it is creepy. Those who didnt see the 1979 film may remember that Wes Craven borrowed the premise for the opening Drew Barrymore sequence in Scream. A babysitter Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) arrives at the lakeside Colorado home of Dr. and Mrs. Mandrakis (Derek de Lint and Kate Jennings Grant) to care for their two children while they do the ""dinner and a movie"" thing. Almost immediately Jill begins to get ominous prank calls heavy breathing and messages wondering if she has checked the children. (She does but not until 2/3 of the running length has elapsed.) Eventually freaked out and unable to reach anyone by phone (her parents are at a concert and everyone from her high school is attending a bonfire party in a location that conveniently does not have cell service) she contacts the police. They trace the call and determine its coming from within the house. This leads to a generic 20-minute hide-and-seek segment that is supposed to be reminiscent of Halloween but more strongly recalls the unfortunate sequels. Tension and character identification are two key pieces necessary for something like When a Stranger Calls to work. The movie has neither. Despite attempts to give Jill a backstory (her boyfriend was caught kissing another girl she has exceeded her parents allotted cell minutes by 800 and has to babysit to pay them back etc.) she remains largely a blank slate. Camilla Belle who impressed in The Ballad of Jack and Rose brings little to the part. Then theres the sheer stupidity evidenced by Jill which goes above and beyond the level one expects from a slasher movie protagonist. Simon West is probably best known for helming the first Tomb Raider. For that film he had no need to master the art of suspense. For something like When a Stranger Calls this is mandatory and he doesnt have a clue. Boo moments - often involving a cat - abound but the movie contains only a single frightening instance (the ""reveal"" of the stranger in the rafters). The narrative doesnt build to anything; it meanders. When things finally get to the point when they have the potential to become sinister When a Stranger Calls devolves into a series of routine chase scenes. If theres one good thing about the movie at least it can be said that the killer doesnt turn out to be a supporting character we have previously encountered. Hes an anonymous psycho. The movie ends with a bizarre and unsatisfying denouement. The epilogue which is designed either to set up a sequel (after all more than 2/3 of the original remains) or lampoon Halloween 2 plays like a sour last note. I suppose someone thought it was clever but it doesnt work. Its another of the films many missteps but by the time it comes we have become accustomed to them. They define When a Stranger Calls a production that never comes close to realizing its potential to tweak the viewers primal fears.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (When a Stranger Calls Suzanne Tenner) D When a Stranger Calls Genre Horror; Starring Camilla Belle Tommy Flanagan; Director Simon West; Author Jake Wade Wall; Release Date Wide 02/03/2006; Runtime (in minutes) 100; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Posted February 8 2006 -- 1200 AM EST It began in 1979 as a Terrorized Teen flick with Carol Kane as the freaked-out babysitter at the wrong end of a telephone call. It continued parodied in 1996 with Scream. And now When a Stranger Calls is ba-a-a-a-c-k in frightless form updated for the age of anytime minutes and caller ID. Pulpy director Simon West appears much more excited about the Zen-ish architecture of the house in which Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) is babysitting two sleeping lumps than about creating a useful sense of anxiety; perhaps he figures everyone has seen Scream anyhow.

"Stranger Calls kills time and thats about it - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Stranger Calls kills time and thats about it By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  February 4 2006 Horror movies have so many useful life lessons to share. Having sex at summer camp will get you killed (Friday the 13th""). Dozing off in class or at home will get you killed (A Nightmare on Elm Street""). Going anywhere near Neve Campbell will get you killed (Scream"" Scream 2"" Scream 3""). In When a Stranger Calls"" not having the right calling plan could get you killed. Even by the lowest standards this is a frightless cynically made movie. But its heroines circumstances would make for a nifty ad for any cellular telephone company.Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) listened to her boyfriend prattle on about how he didnt mean to kiss one of Jills best friends. Hes really sorry -- like 800-minutes-over-the-monthly-limit sorry. But its Jill whos grounded and must repay her folks for the cellphone bill. So she takes a baby-sitting gig at an outrageously over-architected house on a lake. While the kids sleep someone keeps ringing the phone and hanging up. Sometimes the caller will ask Jill Have you checked the children?"" She calls the police but shes on her own to creep very slowly down long corridors and around every corner until shes backed into an anticlimactic cardio-based showdown.When a Stranger Calls"" which was not screened for critics is allegedly a remake of the 1979 chiller of the same name. Really its an extended-play remix of the older movies first 20 minutes in which a prank caller made a young Carole Kane crawl out of her skin. That movie had a classic elegant composition. For the most part the camera remained still. The editing was crisp and deliberate insinuating terror in a way that occasionally tingled the spine. It wasnt great but it worked. This update directed by Simon West (Tomb Raider"") and written by first-timer Jake Wade Wall is radically revised hackwork. Theres enough dead space to give an audience plenty of time to revolt.Its also impossible to sit through knowing the opening scene of Scream"" already tweaked the original Stranger"" so brilliantly. This new version lops off the remaining 70 minutes of the 79 film in which Charles Durning and the steely Colleen Dewhurst confront the films escaped nutjob. West and Wall dont bother with any surprises. Instead they cough up a garden-variety boogeyman then put Belle on a chase-movie treadmill while she protects her two blathering charges. The whole thing ends with a whimper (not to mention the absurd promise of a sequel). Audiences are bound to exit Stranger"" booing knowing full well the movie belongs on their do-not-call list.

A modestly clever concept gets indifferent execution in ""When a Stranger Calls"" another bigger-yet-blander remake of an allegedly ""classic"" 70s shocker. Unleashed without press previews for a Super Bowl weekend opening frame pic might scare up some small change by appealing to ticket buyers in the same demographic as its feisty teen heroine. But its more likely that this ""Stranger"" wont get acquainted with a wider aud until it is reintroduced in homevid format. Original 1979 thriller achieved semi-cult status with an ingeniously nasty first act that has inspired countless imitations -- and quite a few spot-on parodies. (Did somebody say ""Scream""?) In the original babysitter Jill (Carol Kane) is rattled by phone calls from a raspy-voiced stranger who repeatedly asks ""Have you checked on the children?"" Jills fear intensifies when the calls are traced to a phone line inside the house. The 79 pic then leaps ahead a few years to set up a reunion between the phone caller escaped from a mental hospital and Jill who now has her own offspring. For the remake scripter Jake Wade Wall shrewdly opted to jettison everything but the opening 20 or so minutes of the original pic. New ""Stranger"" consists almost entirely of a protracted cat-and-mouse game as an appreciably more formidable but equally terrified Jill (Camilla Belle) is mercilessly stalked and taunted by an apparently omniscient phone caller (played by Tommy Flanagan voiced by Lance Henriksen) during her long dark night of babysitting in a secluded spectacularly opulent home. After setting up this promising premise however Wall and helmer Simon West (""Laura Croft Tomb Raider"") fail to sustain suspense -- or even consistently maintain interest -- during what amounts to 70 or so minutes of fake-outs pregnant pauses and occasionally cheap shocks. (Tacked-on coda which owes more than it can repay to Brian De Palmas ""Carrie"" and several copycats is bound to generate derisive laughter.) Early scenes subtly establish an undeniably unsettling mood as Jill reacts to the ineffably threatening sounds of commonplace household items (motion-triggered lights an automatic icemaker etc.) while outside winds howl and tree branches rustle. A little of this goes a long way however. It doesnt help that the plot mechanics creak much too loudly and the shameless contrivances are all too obvious. In addition sequel goes through elaborate contortions to make sure this Jill doesnt benefit from cell phone technology that original pics heroine didnt have. This leads to one truly amusing plot wrinkle Jill is forced to baby-sit as punishment for using too many minutes on her familys cell phone account. Belle earns props for performing gracefully and compellingly under the pressure of being the only person on screen for long stretches of running time. However supporting players including Katie Cassidy as a bitchy classmate are mostly unremarkable. Production designer Jon Gary Steele merits his own kudos for creating what gradually emerges as Belles most prominent co-star An enormous and ultra-modern three-story house tricked out with glass walls dark shadows and a cavernous atrium. Set allows lenser Peter Menzies Jr. ample leeway to employ an impressive variety of visual stratagems to enhance pics wall-to-wall paranoia. Although in the end thats not quite enough.
