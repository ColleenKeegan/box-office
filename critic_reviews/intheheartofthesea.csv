Entertainment Chris Hemsworth And Leonardo DiCaprio Suffer For Oscars In Their New Movies Both stars try to prove their seriousness as actors in old-timey survival tales In the Heart of the Sea and The Revenant but there is a winner. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Grime-off Chris Hemsworth in In the Heart of the Sea and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant. Warner Bros. Kimberley French / Twentieth Century Fox ID 7539718 Owen Chase a swashbuckling sulky seaman played by Chris Hemsworth has a rough day at work in In the Heart of the Sea. Actually he has a whole bunch of them. To start he gets stuck playing first mate under an inexperienced captain (Benjamin Walker) from a fancy Nantucket family on a voyage he was promised hed get to lead. Then their ship is forced to venture into unknown waters thousands of miles west of South America in search of the whales from which they aim to harvest oil. When the vessel called the Essex is attacked and sunk by a particularly large and ornery whale the remaining sailors starve over months lost at sea eventually resorting to cannibalism to survive.Rough But Chases hardship pales in comparison to what Hugh Glass a gruff frontiersman played by Leonardo DiCaprio goes through in The Revenant. Hes guiding a group of fur trappers through the Dakotas when their numbers are decimated by an Arikara war party and then he gets attacked and energetically mauled by a protective mother bear out in the woods. Hes stitched up and left to die but instead its his kid who passes knifed by the treacherous John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy even less intelligible than usual). Glass crawls his way out of a grave and back through the frigid terrain eating raw meat and tucking himself inside animal corpses Tauntaun-style to keep warm all in order to avenge his sons death. View this image > In the Heart of the Sea Warner Bros. ID 7541923 Why all this lavish hardship in the historical outdoors? Well it is awards season when misery is looked at fondly and misery that takes place safely in the past is looked at with even more affection. In their respective movies Hemsworth and DiCaprio dont just reenact these ordeals they both put themselves through their own minor actorly versions of deprivation in order to play these roles. Hemsworth braved a 500-calorie-a-day diet to pare himself down from Thor-sized to a (more lithe than gaunt honestly) lost-at-sea size. DiCaprio grew a bushy (and as was hilariously rumored by one tabloid possibly flea-infested) beard and weathered a grueling snowy shoot in Canada and Argentina that was supposed to take seven months but ended up spanning closer to a year. They lightly martyred themselves as proof of their dedication to the craft. DiCaprio at least will get another Oscar nomination out of it and in a weak year for leading men he could quite possibly win.The more important question to ask is why anyone would want to watch these man vs. nature endurance trials in which shapeless suffering is offered up as if it has inherent worth. The self-seriousness of these struggles is underscored by the fact that Chase and Glass were both real dudes -- the Essex ordeal would provide fuel for Moby Dick while Glasss life inspired the 2002 Michael Punke novel on which The Revenant is based. Actual men withstood these travails these movies insist and therefore they are worth witnessing even if these men are treated like handsome but grimy hunks of meat desiccating in the South Pacific sun or shivering in a damp bear hide. There is little to them aside from their ability to stay alive even after being menaced by computer-generated beasties a quality that cant even be spun as life-affirming given the grim context in both stories. View this image > In the Heart of the Sea Jonathan Prime / Warner Bros. ID 7541951 Its Hemsworth who gets the lamer deal with In the Heart of the Sea which is directed unmemorably by Ron Howard. The Aussie actor remains better at playing golden gods than he is at scaling down. In Howards last movie the underseen excellent racing rivals drama Rush Hemsworth played James Hunt as a magnetic hedonist. The lazy jungle cat of a man was capable of snapping to attention and totally confident in his skills on the track. In In the Heart of the Sea the actor is splendid when swinging from the sail rigging or harpooning a whale for what the men euphemistically call a ""Nantucket sleighride"" as the wounded animal tries frantically to escape and ends up pulling the boat along with it. But the charisma dissipates when hes bickering with his captain or promising his pregnant wife (Charlotte Riley) hell come home. Chase is a highly resistible working schmo and his angst about being an outsider trying to break into Nantuckets closed society (hes dismissively labeled a ""landsman"") feels as abstract as his clashes with the company men by which hes employed. Hes boring at rest and thats what so much of the latter part of the film is filled with waiting and enduring.The vintage grotesquerie of the regular old whaling process turns out to be more disturbing than the dark adventures that are In the Heart of the Seas reason for being -- the details about stripping the carcass while sharks make the ocean boil then sending the smallest crew member crawling into the head to get the really valuable oil. Once upon a time the world was illuminated by boiled whale -- imagine that. View this image > The Revenant Twentieth Century Fox ID 7542562 Or imagine pelts worth dying for which is the case in the equally archaic industry in which the characters in The Revenant work. Glass and his crew risk their lives trapping in hostile territory and when the Arikara attack them early in the film its to take their skins and sell them to the French. That battle is a sickeningly violent wondrously photographed thing the brilliant cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezkis camera lurching from one character to another as men are shot or scalped or flee from the melee while also taking the time to look up to where the trees and sky remain impassive to the deaths below. Its a sequence thats as gorgeous as it is terrible.The Revenant which is directed by Birdmans Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is without question a brawny display of filmic beauty that leaves In the Heart of the Sea in the doldroms its unforgiving wilderness shot in stunning unwelcoming natural light. But beneath that its a whole lot of sub-Hemingway tough-guy posturing Another white hero whos more native than the natives lectures his half-Pawnee son (Forrest Goodluck) on how to keep himself safe among men who despise him because of his race. Glass has a touch of the wounded and otherworldly to him even before his brush with death -- he dreams of his wife murdered by American soldiers whose voiceover whispers give The Revenant the feel of a particularly gory Terrence Malick knockoff. View this image > The Revenant Twentieth Century Fox ID 7542735 Glass is in other words pretty insufferable and you understand why Fitzgerald loathes the guy even though the more refined Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) the man in charge respects him utterly. The wounds Glass receives in the grizzly attack -- another wrenching showy long take -- bring him to a near-animal state DiCaprio drags himself across the snow rasping and groaning in pain cauterizing his own wound with gunpowder.Its visceral and gross like so much of the action that follows but its also so grubbily severely macho that it trembles right on the verge of funny. Thats hardly the only time The Revenants dourness is awfully close to humor -- theres a scene in which Glass and another man eat raw buffalo in the snow while maintaining heated eye contact and another in which he cozily tucks the edges of an eviscerated horse around his head like a hoodie. DiCaprios performance is more an act of athleticism than it is one of any nuance. Glass is a mass of feral reactions crazed eyes staring out of a dirt-smeared face.The Revenant is so prettily constructed that its painful to admit how ridiculous it actually is and how empty it feels to watch a gruff pseudo-mystical Western consisting of two actors method-style grunting their way toward an inevitable showdown in the snow. Like In the Heart of the Sea The Revenant is set in a realm thats entirely female-free save for Glasss ghost wife and an Arikara woman whos kidnapped and raped. Movies dont have to have a gender balance to be good but The Revenants monotonous manliness is part of its weakness -- it isnt about anything other than the savage violent world its so convinced has innate weight to it. Its revenge plot brings no satisfaction and its observations about the indifference of nature are prosaic. Its a movie about survival in which survival seems as meaningless as everything else in its universe.Though The Revenant is a more ambitious film than In the Heart of the Sea in the end the two survival dramas do the same thing They treat struggle as synonymous with substance even though one definitely doesnt guarantee the other.

Photo Jonathan Prime MOVIE REVIEW In the Heart of the Sea 121 minutes. Rated PG-13 (intense violence tastefully depicted cannibalism). Presenting a ""true"" adventure about a giant whale that supposedly inspired ""Moby-Dick"" raises tsunami-high expectations about ""In the Heart of the Sea"" that are crushed as thoroughly as if star Chris Hemsworth had brought down his ""Thor"" hammer on the entire enterprise. While period whaling adventures may be a lot rarer than superhero movies in contemporary Hollywood theres not much thats see-worthy about Ron Howards waterlogged adaptation of Nathaniel Philbricks novel which is improbably being floated as Oscar bait. Warner Bros. would have been better off sticking with the films original March release date and selling it as a horror movie. The most effective scenes by far show a massive (computer-generated) sperm whale demolishing the whaling ship Essex in 1820 in whats suggested is some kind of environmental karmic payback. The whole thing is bookended by scenes set 30 years later in which Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) -- trying to pass Nathaniel Hawthorne on the best-seller list -- bribes aging survivor Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) to recall the doomed voyage on which Nickerson was a novice cabin boy (played by Tom Holland). Chris Hemsworth and Charlotte Riley.Photo Jonathan Prime As he recalls in endless narration there was much (tiresome) bickering between first mate Chase (a swaggering Hemsworth) who was passed over for a promotion to captain and the inexperienced Pollard (Benjamin Walker) who got the helm because of family connections. Second mate Joy (a wasted Cillian Murphy) tries to keep the peace. The voyage (and the movie) drags on as Chase and Pollard argue over nautical strategies and their pitiful accumulation of whale oil until the proto-Moby Dick mercifully turns up and proceeds to turn the Essex into matchsticks killing much of the crew. Those who survive -- including Chase Pollard and Nickerson -- evacuate to whale boats as the sinking ship burns for a long and grueling (especially for the audience) search for civilization. None of the characters are particularly well drawn delivering florid exposition in a bewildering variety of accents. Its less a spoiler than a consumer warning to say that when they run out of food theyre forced to consume the remains of their less fortunate crew members. If the thought of that makes you seasick rest assured that Howard tastefully renders the cannibalism -- well within the bounds of the PG-13 rating accorded to ""In the Heart of the Sea.""

By Anthony Lane Ron Howards new movie reimagines the ill-fated voyage of a whaling ship.   Credit Illustration by Bill Bragg The new Ron Howard film ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is based not on ""Moby-Dick"" but on one of the true stories on which ""Moby-Dick"" is based. This sets a worrying trend. If Hollywood producers decide that having exhausted so many major novels they can start plundering the source material we are in for a long haul. A woman named Delphine Delamare is said to have given rise to Emma Bovary for instance but could there be other contenders? How many bio-pics of adulterous French housewives can we take? The movie is touchingly explicit about how to write an epic novel. If you are Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) say you show up one night at the home of Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson). He is a survivor of the Essex a whaling ship that set off from Nantucket in 1819 and never came back having been wrecked by a white whale in the Pacific--more desert than sea as Nickerson recalls. He was then a boy of fourteen (Tom Holland) and the trauma of those events has vexed him ever since. By recounting them not only does he assuage the pain; he is also paid by Melville who amply and sufficiently inspired goes away to compose his book. Easy. The meat of the film then belongs to the voyage of the Essex. The captain is a tyro named George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) who got the job because of his moneyed father. Up against Pollard is the more seasoned Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) the first mate who hails from poor farming stock and is not allowed to forget it. Primed by ""Moby-Dick"" we brace ourselves for a clash of sovereign wills but as with so much in the movie the setup peters out. Only once does Howard reap a fitting whirlwind as Pollard displaying poor seamanship and ignoring Chases advice leads his vessel into the maw of a storm. The pacing here is certainly forceful as it is during the harrying and the slaughter of a sperm whale and yet the force lacks clarity. This is partly because computer-generated waves never quite buffet us with the slap of the real thing and also because in the twenty years since Howard made his finest film ""Apollo 13"" something has happened to the editing of action sequences. No longer it seems are we required to know who is doing what and where at any given point. What matters is that the frenzy of the occasion should be matched by the drubbing of the images which must pelt us without pity or interruption. Just to crank up the turmoil ""In the Heart of the Sea"" can be seen in 3-D so that masts and braces keep poking you in the nose. Nothing in the hunt is as memorable as the blessed pause that comes in its wake as the wounded whale sprays blood through its blowhole and Thomass awestruck face is dusted with a rain of red. The camera stays with him and justly so. You can feel his very boyhood being washed away. And so around the Horn into the kingdom of the white whale--a patched and piebald beast which has clearly been told by its agent that it can look forward to a long and fabulous career as the worlds largest metaphor. I relished the smack of its humongous tail which sends a wall of water coursing into the lens and Chases sighting of his prize. ""As I live and breathe hes mine"" he cries harpoon in hand. If only Chris Hemsworths voice were as beefy as his build; for the full effect we need the rich and prophetic intonations of Charlton Heston or the salt-encrusted growl of Robert Shaw in ""Jaws."" Shaw steered closer to Captain Ahab than either Hemsworth or Walker does and the new film barely grazes the madness let alone the rhetorical surge of ""Moby-Dick""--""the great flood-gates of the wonder-world"" as Ishmael calls them. If you want a Ron Howard movie about a man obsessed with a creature from the deep ""In the Heart of the Sea"" sadly is not the place to start. Try ""Splash."" Birdsong and a blur of greenery. That is what we see and hear as ""Son of Saul"" begins and we should treasure the moment while it lasts because the rest of the tale--every beat of its hundred and seven minutes--eradicates any hint of calmness or peace. The release of Laszlo Nemess dumbfounding film in time for the Oscar nominations makes sense; the fact that it should descend upon us during the festive season however is an irony that sticks in the craw. The setting is unnamed although if you were to think of it as Auschwitz-Birkenau you would not be wrong. To be exact we are in the netherworld of the Sonderkommando those prisoners mostly Jewish whose task was to assist with the disposal of other prisoners when they reached the death camps. This activity was itself performed under sentence of death if you were picked to participate you could not refuse and at regular intervals a Sonderkommando squad would be exterminated and replaced by another not least because its members were Geheimnistrager--""bearers of secrets"" as Nemes informs us in a note at the beginning. They could not be permitted to reveal especially to new arrivals what they knew. The focus of the film is in every sense on Saul Auslander (Geza Rohrig) a Hungarian Jew who works in a Sonderkommando. He appears in almost every shot drawing and compelling our attention. When he hefts a corpse we watch the lifter rather than the load. We grow accustomed to the back of his head and to the rough red ""X"" that is daubed on the rear of his jacket as a sign of his duties. Largely though what the camera dwells upon is his face--sharp and stilled the eyes set deep under the eaves of his brow which wears a permanent frown. Note the precise angle of his gaze aimed downward at thirty degrees from the horizontal when there are Nazis present; to meet their gaze would be taken as insolence. No gesture in the movie is as telling as the haste with which Saul during the opening scene snatches off his cap and freezes to the spot head lowered after bumping by accident into a German soldier. Fear of repercussion is a habit. These continual closeups of Saul serve a solemn purpose. They reinforce the sense that one mans testimony is enough. There is no way in which the film (or a hundred films) could represent the breadth of the communal suffering in the camp. All we can hope for is that the experience--the literal viewpoint--of a single witness can be added to the record. By homing in on Saul and on the range of response in his dark eyes we are made so aware of the monstrosities around him that we do not need to have them spelled out. Bare dead bodies are glimpsed often fleetingly at the sides of the frame. The newcomers who are told that hot soup and a shower await them and who are then stripped and herded toward the gas chambers with the help of the Sonderkommando are seldom in focus and the same is true of the corpses borne to the furnaces. This strikes me as merciful and right. The question is not one of taste but of imaginative modesty; to watch most feature films--as opposed to documentaries--about the Holocaust even those as expert as ""Schindlers List"" is to be left with a lasting moral queasiness about the limits of dramatic reconstruction. Just because you can attempt a thorough depiction of a death camp doesnt mean that you should; if your audience goes away convinced that it now knows what went on at Auschwitz youve done something wrong. That is why I admire the judiciousness of Nemes. He gives us only shards. The remarkable thing is that ""Son of Saul"" is a debut Nemes has never directed a full-length film before. As for Rohrig he is a poet as well as an actor born in Budapest and now living in the Bronx. If neither of them made another movie this one would suffice. Should you wish to grapple with its form you might suggest that Nemes twines together too many narrative strands; there is a subplot about an uprising planned among the Sonderkommando plus a private mission undertaken by Saul concerning a boy whom he recognizes in the gas chambers as his son. The father cares nothing for himself but his entire being is bent on finding a rabbi who will say Kaddish for the child. All this takes place in a mere two days. Could Nemes have made the work more spare choosing a random day on which nothing occurred but the ritual toil of horror like the scrubbing of bloody floors? Maybe so yet the film is designed not simply to attest but to protest to ascribe both dignity and identity to the living rebels as to the deceased boy and thereby to refute with a quiet fury the Germans who are heard referring to the bodies of the Jews as ""pieces."" Primo Levi in ""The Drowned and the Saved"" argues that the use of the Sonderkommando was the ""most demonic crime"" of the Nazis. He called it ""an attempt to shift onto others--specifically the victims--the burden of guilt so that they were deprived of even the solace of innocence."" That is the solace that ""Son of Saul"" seeks to restore.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Dec 12 2015 Culture In the Heart of the Sea Ron Howards new maritime epic is based on the same true whaling misadventure that inspired Moby Dick. In case audiences arent aware of this fact the very first character who appears onscreen is a young Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) seen listening to a tale about a giant sperm whale a shipwreck and survival against all odds. It takes a degree of audacity to compare your movie so early on to one of the greatest dramatic epics of all time and what follows might possibly leave viewers longing for Melvilles heroic allegorical masterpiece as opposed to the sober tale of endurance that plays out.Related Story On Herman Melvilles 194th Birthday a Trio of Theories About Moby-Dick In the Heart of the Sea is based on Nathaniel Philbricks nonfiction book which explored two narratives of the sinking of the whaling boat Essex in 1820--one from a hardy first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) and another from a cabin boy Thomas Nickerson (played by Tom Holland as a youngster and Brendan Gleeson in his advanced years). Along with those stories the book laid bare the intricacies of the whaling industry and the tight-knit community of Nantucket that formed its hub. And yet in the film adaptation Howard and the screenwriter Charles Leavitt barely scratch the surface in two hours of plodding action.As a character Thomas is less a sentient being and more the equivalent of a Go-Pro camera lashed to the front of the ship--hes there simply to observe the action and relay it to Melville many years later. Owen although more of a conventional hero as an orphaned outsider and veteran whale killer is unfortunately one-dimensional existing onscreen mostly to grit his teeth and shoot steely gazes at the ocean. Hemsworth and Howards previous collaboration Rush was an energetic biopic where the Australian actor got to play a compelling scoundrel. Chases motivations are plainer Hes got a wife at home hes angling to become a captain himself and the more whales he kills the closer he gets to that goal.The first hour of the film sees Chase clashing with his blue-blooded commander George Pollard (Benjamin Walker)whos been installed as the captain of the Essex through nepotism. But theres precious little at stake Its clear that a terrible calamity awaits them in the Pacific Ocean and their squabbling hardly amounts to much since Chase is always right and Pollard is a stammering fool. When the crew finally encounters a monstrous whale Chase is quickly dissuaded from bringing it down when it crashes into the ship and practically tears it in half.Viewers might find themselves wishing they were watching an adaptation of Moby-Dick instead.Thats the one big action sequence but if you came to In the Heart of the Sea looking for intensity youll be sorely disappointed. The sea as Grantlands Chris Ryan once noted is dope--a great setting for epic cinema whether the waves are rendered in glorious CGI or the actors are freezing their legs off in real dunk tanks. But Howard whos never been a supreme visual stylist somehow misses out on the expansive sweep of the ocean and the whale-attack scenes are a confusing mess to watch. The audience knows things are going wrong but not much more than that. Brief quiet shots of the whale gliding by underwater or stalking its unwitting human prey make more of an impact but those moments end much too quickly.In the Heart of the Sea is in the end a worthy retelling of a fairly simple tale but its a bare-bones story without an Ahab or a Starbuck or a Queequeg there to add some magic. Near the end of the film Melville sits down with a manuscript to write the famous line ""Call me Ishmael"" but viewers are no closer to understanding why he would have been driven to do such a thing. To hear its plot described the film sounds epic--but whats an epic without real characters? If a silent whale is your most magnetic screen presence he should probably appear for more than a few minutes. The rest of the time the films flaws are reflected in Hemsworths face as he squints blankly out at the ocean.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

In contrast to nearly everything else -- characters action themes -- the massive marine mammal is presented clearly potently and without undue exaggeration. He is a bull protecting his herd albeit to a degree as yet unheard of among those who harvest the seas bounty. Unfortunately the film is largely composed of that other stuff unnecessary exposition and narration painfully on-point dialogue jumbled activity on board the whaling ship Essex overwrought considerations of morality etc. Mind you it gets better as it goes the talk between haunted survivor Brendan Gleeson and curious author Ben Whishaw becomes genuine and intimate and the conflict between the American dreamer first mate (Chris Hemsworth) and the bumbling aristocrat captain (Benjamin Walker) is overshadowed by their common enemy out there in the deep. But theres a hollow at the heart of things a strange decency and politeness for a film that strives to depict in epic form mans dark and visceral struggle with the world and himself. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

The remaining crewmen must struggle to survive. By Peter Rainer Film critic December 11 2015 Save for later Saved Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth r.) and Ramsdell (Sam Keeley) give chase to a leviathan. Jonathan Prime/Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Im a sucker for 19th-century seafaring movies especially ones in which the words ""Thar she blows"" can be heard above the din. This is not to say that such movies by definition are good. Case in point Ron Howards ""In the Heart of the Sea"" a serviceable but mostly unstirring adaptation of Nathaniel Philbricks eponymous 2000 nonfiction bestseller which had as its subtitle ""The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex."" But Im pretty sure I heard someone from the topmast yell out ""Thar she blows"" so that counts for a lot. The New England whaling ship Essex was attacked in the South Pacific in 1820 by a gigantic white leviathan capsizing the ship; only a handful of the crew survived after months lost at sea. Does any of this sound familiar? The films flash-forward/flashback conceit scripted by Charles Leavitt is that 30 years later the young novelist Herman Melville bribes the Essexs sole living survivor Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) to unload to him the true story as opposed to the whitewashed official version of what happened aboard the Essex and its aftermath. It seems Melville has a novel he wishes to write but needs a bit more deep background.This framing device is apocryphal of course. Melville knew of the Essex but ""Moby-Dick"" that peerless masterpiece of Shakespearean proportions draws hardly at all on the details of that whaling ships fate. Essentially what the two narratives share is a white whale and the whale in ""In the Heart of the Sea"" when it finally flares its flukes is actually kind of mottled - off-white with greenish-gray accents. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Howard directs the movie as if except for the CGI effects he were an old studio hand in the Golden Age of Hollywood. ""In the Heart of the Sea"" would not look out of place in the same stiff stalwart company as ""Captains Courageous"" or the Clark Gable-Charles Laughton ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (though not with John Hustons ""Moby Dick"" a far more powerful experience). The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The real ocean battle at least until the big guy shows up is not with a whale but between the Essexs clueless high-born Captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) whose lineage unfairly qualifies him for the post and his first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) who by all rights except alas his low-born birth should be commanding the ship. Its the haves versus the have-nots which I suppose has a contemporaneous cachet as does the films depiction of the apocalyptically awful lengths people will go to in order to keep their homes heated. (Just substitute fossil fuels for whale oil.) But thankfully Howard doesnt push the then-and-now comparisons preferring to stick with more palatable material such as the young Nickerson (Tom Holland) descending into the gross gooey innards of a harpooned whale. Later on the men lost at sea cozy up to cannibalism. The white whale of this movie is a ""Jaws""-style attack machine so I guess theres an eco-terrorist side to this story as well. The whale is telling the Essex crew in no uncertain terms not to mess with Mother Nature. Despite Chases stirring exhortations - my favorite ""As I live and breathe hes mine"" - I often found myself rooting for the whale. I never felt this way about the great white shark in ""Jaws"" except possibly when he dined on Robert Shaw.They dont make these kinds of ""Thar she blows"" movies much anymore at least not unless they star Russell Crowe so I guess there are nostalgic pleasures to be had here. The film is uninspiringly OK and if you close your eyes or better yet if you open them you might just believe you had been transported back to 1930s Hollywood. If the movie accomplishes nothing else though I hope it inspires the curious to actually sit down and finally read ""Moby-Dick."" Its an extraordinary yarn. Really.

Grade C Ron Howards ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a curious beast. The ambitions are as big as a whale; the results are an earnest wreck. It could possibly work if you think of the movie as a metaphor for the story its trying to tell but thats a little too meta for something that should be fairly straightforward. Its ostensibly about the real expedition that inspired Herman Melvilles ""Moby-Dick"" that Nathaniel Philbrick wrote about in his nonfiction book. But despite a promising start something is lost in the spectacle and the framing device which ultimately undermines its own story. Howard uses Melville as a character (played by Ben Whishaw) and his curiosity about the mysterious circumstances of how the whaleship Essex sank as the audiences entry into the story. Hes looking for big answers about the unknown. So he finds Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) the ships only remaining survivor whos drinking his life away. At his wifes pleading and Melvilles promise of generous payment for one nights conversation Tom starts to spill about the events of 30 years ago when he was 14 (played by Tom Holland). Its best not to do the math. This is the story of two men he says A Captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) and his first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth). Pollard is the son of the expeditions proprietor. Hes wealthy arrogant entitled and inexperienced. Chase is the real seaman - a working-class Adonis with a classist chip on his broad shoulders. Hes also arrogant but has the skills to back it up. Chase flexes his hero muscles early bounding up a ladder to cut free a tangled sail and the captain responds with ill-advised bravado in leading the men full-speed into a squall. But the ""who leads"" question is abandoned quickly and without much resolution once the whaling starts. Perhaps the most striking scenes are those that deal with the process of catching a whale from spearing to the gory disemboweling. But whales are scarce on the ships normal route and they must sail on to get enough oil for their bosses. Its thousands of miles off the coast of South America where they encounter the big one which locks on the Essex with a Terminators resolve. Hemsworth is best when hes by himself - either barking orders or doing something physical. Of all the actors he shares scenes with its Cillian Murphy as his second mate who brings out something resembling emotion. But we never really care about the lead so theres little hope that well be interested in the rest of the men once it becomes solely about survival. Indeed most of the second half is spent drifting with them on lifeboats. In these interminable minutes we dont get anything resembling an understanding of how they survived (or didnt) either mentally or physically. Future Tom Nickerson isnt much help either and Melville is already too focused on his own literary ambitions to actually ask the big questions he told us he was seeking. ""In the Heart of the Sea"" tries to be about so many things - ambition capitalism greed and survival. In the end it feels most interested in how Herman Melville got his classic. The pieces are there but apparently its up to ""Moby-Dick"" to assemble them not Ron Howard.

It has some genuinely effective passages in its first half and Howard is nothing if not a dutiful check-the-boxes kind of director. 104 Shares Share 83 Tweet 12 Share 9 Share Email Print Share Chris Hemsworth damp whaler. Photo Warner Brothers ""How does one come to know the unknowable?"" are the words that begin Ron Howards In the Heart of the Sea and one wishes the film itself genuinely explored that question instead of merely paying lip service to it. The film is an adaptation of Nathaniel Philbricks best-selling book about the 1820 tragedy of the whaling ship Essex which reportedly inspired Herman Melville to write Moby Dick. Hence the scripts odd framing device in which Melville (played by Ben Whishaw) tracks down an aging haunted sailor named Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) who served as a young crewman on the doomed ship. Nickerson then tells his tale ... which focuses mostly on the ships first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth). In other words Melville narrates a story in which Nickerson narrates a story about Chase. Youd think these nesting framing devices would lead to some kind of deep perceptual insight but no; one suspects theyre there mainly to justify the Moby Dick connection and to get us to Chris Hemsworth leading man. Related Stories How Ina- the Heart of the Seaas Mammoth Whale Was Brought to Life New In the Heart of the Sea Trailer Chris Hemsworth Is Literally Going to Punch a Whale So Herman Melville Can Kind of Write About It But what a leading man he makes brawny and bold and blond and fair. The Viking-like Hemsworth is well-cast as a veteran Nantucket whaler who seeks to command his own ship but whose lowly origins keep him down. Instead Chase is hired as first mate to serve under the less experienced patrician Captain George Holland (Benjamin Walker) scion of a well-established whaling family. (""Blood will always win out"" Chase is told in no uncertain terms.) The two men dont hit it off - first mates and captains rarely do in the movies at least - but their conflict doesnt so much inform the plot as just keep things busy until the whales show up. A  In the Heart of the Sea goes from being a stand-off between dueling officers to a whaling yarn to a survival tale. The whaling sequences probably work best in part because thats where the film is most heavily invested. Howard seems less interested in the men than in the machinery and the viscera - the ropes bolts and harpoons and the fat the entrails the blood. Even the sickly pallor of Anthony Dod Mantles processed-looking color photography works here. This might be the first film Ive ever seen where I couldnt decide if the cinematography was outlandishly beautiful or outlandishly ugly; but in these whaling sequences the difference sort of doesnt matter. A  The materialist filmmaking also makes some thematic sense in the first half. Early scenes on Nantucket portray whaling as a bustling high-stakes industry -- the connections with the modern oil business are overt - in which every ounce of whale fat has value and every piece of equipment has a cost. So when the men of the Essex after months out at sea finally spot a pack of whales blowing out at sea one initially feels a certain sense of relief. But a passage that begins in excitement and triumph ends in melancholy grotesquerie. The men head out in daylight to capture a sperm whale and are surrounded by leaping shiny dolphins; later as they cut the whales carcass up at night theyre surrounded by hungry sharks snapping at the entrails and at the boiling cauldrons of whale oil. Its as if the ship has passed some sort of threshold into hell. A  Sure enough a reckoning soon comes courtesy of a massive relentless whale -- its whitish body pockmarked and deeply scarred giving it the aura of an avenging demon. This and what follows is perhaps ""the unknowable"" we heard so much about earlier. But the meat-and-potatoes Howard is uncomfortable in the realm of the spirit or the metaphysical. He can film objects and he can film people but he cant quite film emptiness. The cosmic vastness of the sea eludes him. As does the horror of what the men have to endure. He wants to rub our faces in it but hes not the kind of director to go dark like that. A  All this is given a further cruel irony by the narrative presence of Melville that great poet of the sea and of the material-made-abstract; the film fails to show us the very thing that it contends the author himself learned from the tale of the Essex. It also doesnt help that the script hasnt done the necessary work of giving life to the many faces on the ship. Hemsworth is his usual likable self but any other character details we get feel rudimentary and trite. Since a survival tale is mostly worthless if you dont care about any of the people trying to survive the air gets drained from the movie. In the Heart of the Sea isnt a bad film necessarily. It has some genuinely effective passages in its first half and Howard is nothing if not a dutiful check-the-boxes kind of director. But a story like this - one of horror and madness which helped give birth to an ornate masterpiece of obsession - needs to go a little crazy. And this director doesnt do crazy.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 11 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Dec. 10 2015 355PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ron Howard Written by Charles Leavitt Starring Chris Hemsworth Benjamin Walker and Ben Whishaw Classification PG Genre action Country USA Language English ""The sea was angry that day my friends ..."" - George CostanzaEarly in Ron Howards wishfully epic In the Heart of the Sea a doleful wife pleads with Herman Melville begging the writer to pry the hellish story from her husband that has long traumatized him. ""Theres an agony about him"" she says. ""His soul is in need of confession."" As is this reviewers. For In the Heart of the Sea is a grand disappointment and an underwhelming voyage - saltwater gargles have been more adventurous. The film is based on Nathaniel Philbricks 2000 non-fiction book of the same name about the ill-fated whaling expedition in 1820 that inspired Melvilles Moby-Dick. Over and over again other great seafaring movies popped into my head while watching Howards folly a film that treads water and fails to catch wind. Thar she blows one might say.Howard does capture the whaling age well mind you. The blubber business was essentially the first oil industry and the early 19th-century Nantucket we see (and almost smell) has the bustle greed and grime of any boom town. ""Without you the world plunges into darkness"" a whaling-ship captain is told because the oil ""fuels the machines of industry forward as our noble species evolves.""Of course some members of the species are more noble and evolved than others. Benjamin Walker is Captain George Pollard Jr. an inexperienced ship leader promoted on nepotism alone. You just know hes going to get his fishing lines tangled with the hunky more capable but working-class Chris Hemsworth as First Mate Owen Chase. (First Mate Ill say - am I right ladies?)The snag with Walker and Hemsworth (an Aussie who seemingly sought out one of the Wahlbergs for close-enough East Boston-accent advice) is that they dont really hit it off as a duo not hitting it off. Charles Laughton and Clark Gable they aint.Also troubling is the storytelling format. We have watchable Ben Whishaw as Melville tracking down and interviewing good old Brendan Gleeson as hard-drinking Thomas Nickerson the haunted survivor of the sunken whale ship Essex and the only one still alive to tell the harrowing tale which we observe in flashback. The thing is the young Nickerson was a cabin boy not central to the story. A bit awkward that.We do get the story though. (And yes one supposes its a whale of one.) The ship heads out a storm happens the captain misjudges it a sperm whale goes all Jaws-like the Essex sinks and the unspeakable things that happen aboard the lifeboats account for the horror the cabin boy has carried with him all these years.At the heart of the problem with this period piece is an absence of a riveting scene or a memorable slice of dialogue. Give us a Robert Shaw shark-hunter-Quint speech give us some Sperm Whale Dundee (""You call that a harpoon? This is a harpoon"") - heck give us a Seinfeld marine biologist soliloquy.What we are given is a topical wonderfully shot metaphor for mans willfulness hubris and exploitative nature. A whale fights heroically but falls to his hunters blood spouting from its blowhole like oil from a strike in the ground. But Howard fumbles this as well not letting that scene alone suggest the oil-based allegory. Later the parallel is spelled out obviously and Melville weeps at the humdrumness of it all.

Pictures)A lumbering sea adventure that never finds its bearings Ron Howards ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a whale of a dud.Based on Nathaniel Philbricks 2000 book ""In the Heart of the Sea"" tells the story that inspired ""Moby Dick."" The extra layer of filtering is unnecessary (why not just do ""Moby Dick"" instead?) and it creates an awkward framing device around a story thats already treading water.So we see Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) hearing the tale of the whale ship Essex told to him by a reticent Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson). Melville jots down notes by candlelight as Nickerson recounts the tale of how he and his crew went on a voyage to collect whale oil and ended up lost at sea for months on end after encountering some massive angry sea beasts. The scenes between the two are stiff and we get no sense of Melville as anything but a guy who once heard a story then wrote a book that would become the most famous piece of literature in American history. Sounds easyMost of the movies action is dedicated to Nickersons tale within a tale with Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) and his crew mates on the high seas in search of whales to slaughter. Of course they battle big storms and things go terribly wrong because when have you ever seen a movie on a boat where things dont go terribly wrong? (Yes that includes ""Boat Trip."")There are internal struggles onboard the ship mostly between Chase and the ships captain (Benjamin Walker) and his second mate (Cillian Murphy). There is the story of the young cabin boy (Tom Holland) who after crawling inside the head of a whale (rendered in very gross detail) grows up to be the guy who tells Melville his tale. And then there is that whale a big CGI creature that creates a whole mess of trouble for the men on the ship.The whale watching never impresses visually. Howard cuts from wide shots of the vast ocean to close ups of the men on small whaling boats and the obviously green-screened shots look as cheesy as covers of sea tale paperback books. (Skip the needless 3D upgrade it doesnt add anything but a headache.) The fakery makes it difficult to suspend disbelief and is always taking you out of the story.Not that the story is all that compelling in the first place. It is a familiar lost-at-sea yarn with the desperation and struggle to survive that comes part and parcel with the territory. This one in particular gets rather gruesome though its more fringe elements (cannibalism anyone?) are glossed over off-screen while Charles Leavitts screenplay forgoes the psychological torture of being adrift in the ocean and instead focuses on the physical strains.Hemsworth comes off stiff as he often does when used in wooden heroic roles. When hosting ""Saturday Night Live"" earlier this year (and in summers ""Vacation"" where he was the lone bright spot) he showed strong comedic sensibilities but here hes the rugged stoic honorable type -- hes Thor as an 1800s whaler -- and beyond his incredible good looks he doesnt leave an impression.Howard who also teamed with Hemsworth for 2013s thrilling Formula One drama ""Rush"" is off his mark here. In attempting to deliver the story of the story of ""Moby Dick"" he -- and the movie -- are on a sinking ship.agrahamdetroitnews.comgrahamoramaIn the Heart of the Sea GRADE C-Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and peril brief startling violence and thematic material. 22 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1QzxKyL MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/12/10/movie-review-whale-tale-heart-sea-wet/77129932/,200,intheheartofthesea10,intheheartofthesea,detroitnews

The film tells the true story that inspired Moby-Dick. VPCChris Hemsworth stars as first mate Owen Chase in In the Heart of the Sea.(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Ron Howards In the Heart of Sea sets sail with barrels of drama aboard explores dudes being dudes and unleashes the most fearsome seabound villain this starboard side of Jaws.The Oscar-winning directors adaptation ( out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) of Nathaniel Philbricks novel doubles as a thriller and disaster film though the plot seems shallow before the whaling ship Essex sets out and after it gets destroyed by one extraordinarily ticked-off marine mammal.The legend of the real-life gigantic sperm whale inspired Herman Melville to pen his masterpiece Moby-Dick. In the movie Melville (played by Ben Whishaw) finds one of the living crewmembers of the Essex Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) to regale him with well a whale of a tale.Tom Holland stars as the orphaned teenage Nickerson on his first trip to find and bring back whale oil for the thriving industry in Nantucket Mass. circa 1820. Sailing veteran Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) is in prime position to captain the Essex but politics lead to the ship coming under the leadership of the untested George Pollard (Benjamin Walker). George comes from a top-notch sailing family while in certain circles Chase is mocked for being a ""landsman"" and not a true sea guy.CINCINNATI.COMFrischs 175M takeover done Chase puts pride aside for a paycheck as the newcomers first mate yet with his ability on the water he clearly outshines the insecure Pollard causing strife among them and putting the whole crew in bad straits.The tide turns when on the way to South America they start finding whales brutally killing them -- by the time they venture too far east and ultimately find a plethora of the creatures to harpoon Howard has presented the sailors both as salt-of-the-earth men and greedy murderers in a sense.So when a monstrous whale swims into their life the audience almost understands the creatures point of view. It takes violent revenge on the Essex absolutely annihilating the ship. And after whats left of the crew gets away it comes back for more destruction leaving the sailors stranded for 90 days and forced to go to desperate lengths to get back home.More so than other waterlogged pictures Howard creates an immersive gorgeously shot experience pitting man against beast in the ocean for the films most spectacular scenes which are reminiscent of old-school scope of Mutiny on the Bounty and other watery adventures of yesteryear.USA TODAYTimeline North Korea and the Sony Pictures hackCharles Leavitts screenplay focuses on the sailors bickering and bonding though the most intense scenes come between Whishaws and Gleesons quietly profound performances. As for the crew of the Essex Chase is the most fleshed out -- with a wife back home and a kid hes never met -- but many of the sailors have few qualities to differentiate them which hurts the tale later when watching these men we dont know waste away.Holland does a good job as the greenest seafarer of the bunch Walker and Cillian Murphy (as second mate Matthew Joy) both add extra skill to the mix but In the Heart of the Sea really gives Hemsworth a chance to shine. Hes not just the hammer-slinging Thor The Aussie continues to make the most of his dramatic work -- as in Howards 2013 Formula 1 film Rush -- and showcases a considerable amount of gravitas.Chase has a staredown with the magnificent whale in one key moment him looking haggard and it filled with fury that is as touching and human as any in Heart of the Seas deep end of emotion. 53 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1QzbHIF",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/12/10/review-in-the-heart-of-the-sea-movie/77059200/,200,intheheartofthesea12,intheheartofthesea,usatoday

The first is a rousing deep sea adventure about a ship venturing into rarely-traveled waters in search of one of the eras most valuable commodities sperm whale oil. Its a little like an early 19th century ""Deadliest Catch"" (with a little The Perfect Storm thrown in for good measure). The second is a survivalist story about the 90 day odyssey of the men who escaped a shipwreck floating around in the ocean hoping to be rescued. Howard has arguably bitten off more than he can chew with this story - for an epic tale of this scale to work it needs to unfold gradually - something the two-hour running time doesnt permit. So to speed things up we get a voiceover narrative frequent time jumps and an emphasis on spectacle over character. In the Heart of the Sea is based on a true story based on a true story. It goes two layers deep with most of the historical accuracy getting lost along the way. Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) is known to have based his landmark classic Moby Dick on the sinking of the whaling ship Essex in 1820. This movies wraparound story has Melville (circa 1848) interviewing the sole survivor of the Essex Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson). Cue flashbacks which comprise most of the movie. Although the Melville scenes establish the connection between the Essex and Moby Dick they feel extraneous and lazy allowing numerous narrative shortcuts. The core of the film follows the Essex as under the command of George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) it ventures far from land in a quest to fill 2000 barrels with oil. The journey is expected to take anywhere from one to three years. Pollard an inexperienced captain has a fractious relationship with his seasoned first office Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth). A strong mutual antipathy impels them to complete the mission as quickly as possible so as to be rid of each other. After an initial success (a thrilling and insightful sequence detailing the hunting and killing of a whale) they are beset by failure until a lead offers the promise of filling their cargo hold. But when they arrive at this would-be killing zone they are turned from predator to prey as a monster whale treats the Essex like a toy. Promotional material might lead the viewer to expect the whale to play a bigger part in the movie than it does. Aside from the scenes that depict it destroying the Essex its role is minor. The screenplay brings it back a couple of times later in the film to inject action and suspense but this isnt about the obsession of one seafarer with the destruction of a whale. Instead its about a group of men doing whats necessary to survive while floating around in a lifeboat with exhausted provisions and no land in sight. Some of what they do isnt pretty - think Alive. The biggest problem with In the Heart of the Sea is its episodic nature. Especially during the post-sinking saga things dont flow smoothly. Its unclear whether this is more a script or editing issue but theres a surprising lack of tension and scenes that are supposed to engender a strong reaction are too understated to provoke the expected response. The characters are curiously one-dimensional and their interaction is generic - until they become too weak to do more than lie listlessly in the bottom of the boat baking in the sun. Most of the men populating the film are familiar types - the arrogant insecure captain; the brave heroic second-in-command; the hard-working eager-to-learn greenhorn; etc. On a dramatic level In the Heart of the Sea offers too little for it to be completely successful. Visually and viscerally the film provides reasons to pay the price of admission and see it in a theater. There are moments of grandeur such as when the whale launches itself high into the air or when the ship wrestles with the raging winds of an angry tempest. Such instances will lose power on a smaller screen. The 3-D on the other hand is not a selling point. Once again it adds little or nothing aside from a surcharge and the mandate to wear uncomfortable recycled sunglasses. Although this is not an actors movie Chris Hemsworth is effective as the cocky-but-likeable Chase - this is some of the most complete acting he has done since his appearance in another Howard film Rush. As his foil Benjamin Walker is less adept. His performance is more aloof and as a result its hard to develop a feeling for Captain Pollard one way or the other. The three actors appearing in the wraparound segments - Ben Whishaw Brendan Gleeson and Michelle Fairley - are underused. In the end Id have to say I felt about the same about In the Heart of the Sea as I did about this years Everest. Both are about the power of nature and the survival instincts of men. Both feature strong visual images. And both are found lacking in the storytelling department (in large part because of time constraints). The film will find great appeal among those who like seafaring adventure stories and man-versus-nature spectacles. Its not an Oscar contender but as a way to bridge the gap between the Thanksgiving releases and the Biggest Movie Event of 2015 its a solid option.

Jonathan Prime/Courtesy of Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Jonathan Prime/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Chris Hemsworth as Owen Chase in a scene from In the Heart of the Sea. Jonathan Prime/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Seafaring adventures like In the Heart of the Sea do not benefit from gravitas any more than a vessel benefits from extra weight in the cargo hold. They are about white squalls rope burns cracked hulls torn sails men overboard malevolent sea creatures and water water everywhere and not a drop to drink. They are about hearty sailors staving off mutiny and fighting for survival relying on their wits and resorting to desperate measures if necessary. Pause for even a moment to ruminate on spiritual or existential crises and the great ship starts to list. In the Heart of the Sea does a fair bit of listing because its not just about any ol ocean voyage. Its about the Essex the Nantucket ship that was sunk by a sperm whale in 1820 and served as the inspiration for Herman Melvilles Moby-Dick. Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Charles Leavitt working from the Nathaniel Philbricks National Book Award winner for nonfiction cannot content themselves with allowing this harrowing survival tale to unfold without reaching for higher meaning. Instead they bring in Melville himself in the framing story which has the young author (played by Ben Whishaw) querying Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) one of the few men to survive the Essexs journey to the Pacific. The crew of the Essex is stalked by a 100-foot whale and eventually scattered in rescue boats on the open sea where they have to do unspeakable things in order to stay alive. Yet Moby-Dick is such a touchstone of American fiction that it becomes Howards own white whale that significant something that his film cannot quite grasp. Take away the framing story however and In the Heart of the Sea functions well enough as a frenetic horror-thriller touched by the mythic with ill fortune chasing these sailors like the wrath of God made manifest. Or perhaps a more sensible Jaws The Revenge with a whale instead of a shark. Once the tormented Nickerson finally starts telling his story the film flashes back to the Nantucket harbor when Nickerson was just a lowly cabin boy on the Essex a vessel commissioned to bring back a bounty in whale oil. Before they even leave port tensions are high between George Pollard Jr. (Benjamin Walker) an untested captain from elite stock and first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) a heartier but less connected seaman. Pollard and Chase disagree sharply on tactics--Chase for example feels it unwise to motivate the crew by steering the ship directly into a squall--but they soon have bigger things to worry about. After falling short in the hunt the men follow a tip that leads them a thousand miles off the coast of South America but the bounty of whales they encounter includes a beast of almost supernatural force. A year after directing Hemsworth through the Formula One racing drama Rush Howard brings the same kinetic style to the whaling sequences here which throw the camera into sea-level tussles with whales not easily felled by harpoons. In the Heart of the Sea makes an ordinary hunt looks like such a harrowing white-knuckle ordeal that Melvilles famed white whale has no trouble achieving its intended God-like stature. Had the film merely been about an expedition gone wrong--the Essex if Melville had never gotten wind of it--Howard might have sailed on fairer seas avoiding the headwinds of a literary classic. But In the Heart of the Sea gets into trouble when assigning a higher meaning to the voyage. ""How does a man come to know the unknowable?"" asks Melville in the opening narration threatening the symbolism to come. The story of the Essex carries inherent themes of mans arrogance and hubris in the face of nature but Melvilles presence inflates them with self-importance. The Essex becomes a stand-in for humanitys relationship with vengeful God and its too much for the film to handle especially when it relies so much on the author himself to give it significance. Leave that to Moby-Dick.

The whale -- a giant bull sperm whale with patches of white on his prune-wrinkly grey-black body -- is the one which sank the whaling ship The Essex in 1820 and eventually became immortalized in the fictionalized novel Moby-Dick. The story of revenge belongs to the whale which became enraged when the men aboard this Nantucket ship began the bloody harvest of members of a sperm whale pod far out in the Pacific Ocean. The brutality is evident in the exacting detail that director Ron Howard and screenwriter Charles Leavitt layer into the procedural side of this hyper-realistic film. The survival struggle is the tale of how some of the sailors who survived the ramming inflicted by Moby Dick made their way back to land after months of torturous existence in small whaleboats. Cannibalism was one critical part of the survival process. Howard working with a strong cast led by Chris Hemsworth as the heroic and then eventually disillusioned first mate of The Essex does a good job of balancing his parallel and interlocking plots. Especially because he introduces us to the story through a flashback which is triggered decades after the tragedy by the appearance of American novelist Herman Melville (played convincingly by Ben Whishaw). Melville would make his name in the annals of American writing with Moby-Dick a legendary 1851 novel that turns the true-life tale into a classic myth. In the film Melville coaxes a grizzled veteran of the high seas (played by Brendan Gleeson) into recounting what happened on The Essex which he had served as a cabin boy named Thomas Nickerson (who is portrayed as a youth by Tom Holland). The film itself is based on a non-fiction account by a modern American author Nathaniel Philbrick who published In the Heart of the Sea The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex in 2000. Naturally no one should watch this and think everything is absolutely accurate. But the essence of the real story is maintained in the dramatic film. Hemsworth shedding his Thor persona is excellent as the stalwart Owen Chase the first mate who defied his bosses upon his return to the home port to tell the world what really happened -- that a whale could sink a ship. Emotionally we are one with Chase Nickerson and a handful of others onboard The Essex; we are less taken with Captain George Pollard Jr. (the excellent Benjamin Walker) and his creepy relative second mate Matthew Joy (Cillian Murphy). But I personally found myself rooting most enthusiastically for the whale Moby Dick. Howard allows us to empathize subtly placing moments in the film that show a tremendous appreciation for the whale especially when Chase is staring eye-to-eye with the extraordinarily aggressive creature. As a film In the Heart of the Sea looks old-fashioned. It is mounted as a handsome period piece in period style except for the modern special effects to make the close-ups of the whale look real. But it is also a bridge to modern thinking and a desperately thrilling adventure story. In the Heart of the Sea will have you rooting for the whale Actor Chris Hemsworth and director Ron Howard both want audiences to empathize with the whales and not necessarily with the whalers in Howards new high seas adventure film In the Heart of the Sea. The period film is set in 1820 and recounts how a sperm whale sinks a whaling ship called The Essex eventually inspiring the legendary novel Moby-Dick. ""I was kind of concerned even embarking on this journey"" Hemsworth says in an interview. ""It was essential I think to show the effect that the brutality (of whale killing) was having on the men. And also to show that potentially there was some doubt or remorse in what they were doing."" At the same time he says ""This was the industry at the time. This was the way of the world and they didnt have any choice. But this is also what I loved about the transition and the arc of my character. When he was face-to-face with this whale finally there was a moment of truth and he was forced to look in a mirror and take stock of what is was doing and why and what drove him into this predicament. So I am glad that that message has come through and it doesnt just look like Heres a snapshot of the whaling industry. "" For Howard it took a conversation with Steven Spielberg to convince him to move forward with the project which Spielberg was aware of having read Charles Leavitts screenplay. ""I asked him How do you think people are going to respond to the whalers? Steven said Well I think people can separate themselves (even if they are more sympathetic to the whales) and they will be fascinated by the history if it feels authentic."" Howard says he never wanted to demonize the whale Moby Dick even though he sinks a ship and men die. ""I always thought that our whale was not the shark in Jaws He was more like King Kong a force awakened"" Twitter Bruce_Kirkland bruce.kirklandsunmedia.ca Sponsored Links See All Sponsored Links Top stories Popular Latest Videos Mayor John Tory kicks off the dancing at start of Caribbean Carnival parade Bullets fly at Christie Pits park boot camp Police ID man killed in rooming house No winning ticket for Friday nights 60 million Lotto Max jackpot Ottawa Pokemon Go player among first to catch all North American Pokemon Police ID man killed in rooming house Bullets fly at Christie Pits park boot camp Osheaga 2016 Live coverage Mayor John Tory kicks off the dancing at start of Caribbean Carnival parade Ottawa Pokemon Go player among first to catch all North American Pokemon Forcillo Sentencing TTC Surveillance Footage of Sammy Yatim Shooting Woman calls out sexual harassment on subway Long Plain First Nations chief addresses band following tornado on reserve Ford back at city hall More from Movies Suicide Squad Who are the villains populating DCs next hit?

Comments click to enlarge In the Heart of the Sea Video Rated PG-13  122 minutes  2015 Ron Howards alternately awesome and wooden whaling epic tells the true story of the Essex whose destruction by a giant vengeful sperm whale in 1820 became the source material for Moby-Dick. The CGI folks have outdone themselves on the whale which stretches nearly 100 feet in length and has crummy skin peeling away and exposing the great white blubber beneath; the scenes of it leaping into the air and thundering down on the ship give an overwhelming sense of its deadly tonnage. After the Essex is destroyed the crew members endure three months of privation in lifeboats on the high seas; Howard shot this part in sequence and put his actors on a strict wasting diet which gives them something to boast about now and probably made them easier to handle on location.

The first of this winters three unabashedly macho movies arrives Friday with ""In the Heart of the Sea"" Ron Howards grand maritime adventure about the whaling ship Essex whose fate helped inspire Herman Melvilles ""Moby-Dick."" Later this month well see Alejandro Inarritus ""The Revenant"" and Quentin Tarantinos ""The Hateful Eight"" each of which like Howards film contains approximately one major female character. For now ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is the manliest movie in theaters. advertisement | advertise on newsday It begins with Melville (Ben Whishaw) arriving at a Nantucket inn to interview Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) who sailed the Essex as a boy (Tom Holland) and is the crews last living survivor. Melville desperately wants to hear the story -- he senses potential -- and Nickerson played as a glowering old seaman by Gleeson reluctantly agrees to relive the nightmare. This stormy-night framing device is old as the hills and corny as heck -- and it hooks us like fish. In the winter of 1820 when whale oil was as valuable as todays crude the Essex set sail helmed by a well-born rookie Captain Pollard (Benjamin Walker) and his more experienced first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth ""Thor""). The two hated each other but they eventually found a common enemy a massive whale ""white as alabaster"" oblivious to harpoons and seemingly bent on revenge. From there the film becomes a thoroughly engrossing tale of unimaginable wreckage grim survival and that ever-powerful taboo cannibalism. ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a Hollywood movie in the best way. It looks spectacular with roaring storms and underwater explosions but it also looks alluringly unreal. (The Oscar-winning cinematographer is Anthony Dod Mantle of ""Slumdog Millionaire."") Shot partly in a giant tank the open-water scenes have a heightened ultra-vivid feel that recalls the intensely-lit style of Hollywoods Golden Age. The movies paucity of women (Charlotte Riley plays Owens little-seen wife) may strike some as a throwback too. Still ""In the Heart of the Sea"" works as top-notch entertainment thanks to its literary sensibility (its based on Nathaniel Philbricks nonfiction book) and a strong emotional undercurrent (the shutdown Nickerson resembles a traumatized war veteran). Subtle questions about the price we pay for natural resources gives this old-fashioned movie just the right touch of modern relevance.

"In the Heart of the Sea needs less tech more humanity - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies In the Heart of the Sea review Less tech more humanity needed Heart of the Sea Warner Bros. Pictures Chris Hemsworth as Owen Chase in ""In the Heart of the Sea."" Chris Hemsworth as Owen Chase in ""In the Heart of the Sea."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""In the Heart of the Sea"" isnt a disaster so well have none of those ""Thar she blows"" wisecracks in this review thank you.Nor is it an actual success. Director Ron Howard goes at this dutiful adaptation of the Nathaniel Philbrick nonfiction bestseller like a filmmaker assigned not obsessed. The results tell us more about the state of digital effects and the price were paying as moviegoers for an overreliance on this technology than they do about leviathans or the fear and wonder in desperate mens souls brought about by a blubber-based economy. I mean look Of course a big-budget 21st-century movie about high-seas whaling and a scarily large alabaster adversary brings with it a load of computer-generated imagery. In 1820 the Nantucket whaling ship Essex set off on a 2 1/2-year voyage manned by a crew of 21 under the command of an insecure overbearing greenhorn of a captain. Storm damage hobbles the Essex but the crew presses on in search of the lucrative whale oil theyll bring back to Nantucket.Quicker than you can think of the dirty-limerick rhyme for ""Nantucket"" the Essex runs afoul of a strange sight far off the coast of South America. Its a sperm whale waging a one-whale protest against whaling. Depending on the shot the key selling point of ""In the Heart of the Sea"" looks to be either 80 feet in length nearly as long as the ship itself or quite a bit larger. What happened next was grim a ship smashed by its prey; survivors in separate smaller boats; cannibalism; death for many; survival for a handful including young Tom Nickerson (Tom Holland) who grows up haunted by the tragedy and turns into Brendan Gleeson (every young actors dream if the young actor knows anything about anything). The framework of ""In the Heart of the Sea"" as scripted by Charles Leavitt finds the older sodden Nickerson visited by novelist Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) intent on learning the truth behind the Essex saga for the book hes writing.Hows this for perversity? The ordinary scenes between Whishaw and Gleeson have more going on than everything the movies actually about. Chris Hemsworths top-billed as the hardy first mate Owen Chase who must put up with the deadly decision-making of Capt. George Pollard (a dull and miscast Benjamin Walker). The ocean-going sequences rely on what weve come to expect or endure in so many modern epics digital effects that never quit plus a frantic lurching editing rhythm that never establishes a pleasing pace. Its fair to say this of Howards film You wont believe your eyes. Thats the problem. Its halfway to the realm of being a digitally animated feature. ""In The Heart Of The Sea"" trailer ""In The Heart Of The Sea"" tells the story of the whaleship ""Essex."" It opens on March 13 2015. ""In The Heart Of The Sea"" tells the story of the whaleship ""Essex."" It opens on March 13 2015. See more videos You see so many amazing sights yet you dont quite believe them; they look too good too clinically pristine too fraudulently pretty. Howard has Anthony Dod Mantle at his side one of the best cinematographers yet the light in the movie never really approximates either real life or old Hollywood. (The film was shot primarily in England on soundstages and off the coast of La Gomera in the Canary Islands.)""No right-minded sailor discards what might yet save him"" Hemsworth intones wisely interrupting an impromptu burial at sea in the name of the survivors next meal. As the mens fates are determined one by one and the days spent stranded at sea grind on the film grinds on as well. Even so ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a strangely jumpy entity nervous about boring its audience for even a second. We never get a full eerie sense of the isolation or the slowly accumulating dread of the situation.Melville finished his novel of course to widespread critical and public indifference. Then ""Moby-Dick"" found and made its deserved reputation long after Melvilles death. I wish Howards film had more of a distinct personality and drive behind it; Howards made some supremely enjoyable films in various keys but this waterlogged effects-crazed picture isnt one of them.

Chris Hemsworth as Owen Chase in ""In the Heart of the Sea.""  (Warner Bros. Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 10 2015In the Heart of the SeaStarring Chris Hemsworth Benjamin Walker Tom Holland Cillian Murphy Ben Whishaw and Brendan Gleeson. Directed by Ron Howard. At GTA theatres. 121 minutes. PGA whale of a tale becomes more like a minnow of one for In the Heart of the Sea Ron Howards ultimately adrift but still seaworthy Moby-Dick prequel.Based on the true story of the Essex a Nantucket whaler destroyed in 1820 by an enormous leviathan its accurately presented as the inspiration for Herman Melvilles titanic novel of maritime adventure. Article Continued BelowWhat the picture could have used was a lot more whale. This is a rare example when the hide-the-monster mantra so effective to horror doesnt apply. The moments when the angry white-grey beast is vengefully attacking the Essex and its crew are enthralling even knowing that CGI is behind Anthony Dod Mantles muscular lens. But the becalming time spent before and after might have some viewers wishing they could bail for the exits. Ben Whishaw plays an inquiring Melville and Brendan Gleeson the prodded and haunted Essex survivor Tom Nickerson in the prologue and epilogue with the rest of the saga being told in flashback to 30 years earlier.This framing technique works well enough even if Tom Holland who plays the younger version of Nickerson doesnt look at all like Gleeson. Under Howards sturdy but unflashy command and with a script by Blood Diamonds Charles Leavitt (no Melville he) the 3D camera whisks us to the early 19th century when whale oil was essential for lighting cities and adventurers like Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) were eager to hunt for it.Chase has a fetching young wife but he also has a love for the sea and for whaling and hes highly skilled at both pursuits. Hes expecting to be given command of his own ship for a 2-1/2-year voyage around South America to gather enough oil to keep streets lit and bankers smiling. Instead the Essexs backers give the helm to greenhorn toff George Pollard Jr. (Broadways Benjamin Walker) much to Chases fury.But Chase signs on for the voyage regardless in part because his close friend Matthew Joy (Cillian Murphy) is along for the ride as second mate.Testosterone dynamics are thus doubled as the men battle both each other and a testy giant whale that has no fear of humans or their harpoons as the scars on the beasts back would attest.Hemsworth swashes good buckle as the determined and resourceful Chase as strong here as he was in Howards racing-car drama Rush. But theres only so much he can do with a script that ends up in the lost-at-sea doldrums whenever the big whale is away with only such joyless pursuits as bickering insanity and cannibalism to keep boredom at bay.This whale tale doesnt blow but it does sniffle a bit too much.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Updated July 30 2016  853 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Review In the Heart of the Sea is dry storytelling By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Dec 10 2015 (...) Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) and George Pollard Jr. (Benjamin Walker) were never meant to work together. Chase is a seasoned seaman and a proven leader of men. Pollard comes from a privileged background and seems to think that hes entitled to his new post ships captain.Chase begs to differ but is obliged to accept an offer to be Pollards first mate. Once theyre at sea the stage is set for a personality conflict of stormy proportions. But what neither man counts on is a force of nature thats far more important than their mutual animosity a whale so dangerous and determined that it will forever haunt their memories.What began as a search for whale oil (which in the 19th century was used as fuel) becomes a struggle for survival. The story is told in flashbacks as novelist Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) grills wizened survivor Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) for details about the doomed voyage to the South Pacific. Wilkerson initially declines to cooperate but the novelists cash proves to be a powerful incentive.The information will in part inspire Melvilles masterpiece ""Moby-Dick."" ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is an oddly uninvolving adventure story -- and the latest film from director Ron Howard who last worked with Hemsworth on the well-regarded race-car drama ""Rush"" (2013). Working from a screenplay by Charles Leavitt (""Blood Diamond"") that was based on a nonfiction book by Nathaniel Philbrick Howard aims for old-school thrills that he only intermittently delivers. The film is best appreciated as a showcase for Hemsworth who brings true movie-star charisma to the proceedings and demonstrates that theres more to him than playing Thor in comic-book movies.But the most compelling onscreen presence is the whale-- who unlike the rest of the cast is spared the wooden dialogue.What ""In the Heart of the Sea""  21/2 stars out of four  Run time 202  Rating PG-13  Content Intense sequences of action and peril violence  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags In The Heart Of The Sea Calvin Wilson Chris Hemsworth Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Years after Moby-Dick was a flop Herman Melville visited an old ships captain named George Pollard. Both men had seen better days. In their youth both had sailed the seas with some success. Melville had written novels about his adventures with island girls and Pollard had once helmed one of Nantuckets most successful whaling ships the Essex. The Essex however sank after it was rammed by a whale forcing its eight survivors to feed on the dead -- or in one instance the newly murdered. Pollards second ship the Two Brothers sank too.Now bad-luck Pollard -- a ""Jonah"" in sailor slang -- had washed up ashore as a night watchman. In a bitter parallel the novel inspired by Pollard was so savaged by critics (the London Literary Gazette wished ""both him and his whales at the bottom of an unfathomable sea"") that Melville quit writing and became a customs inspector. The Essex had tanked two careers. Yet the failed author was generous toward Pollard. ""To me [he was] the most impressive man tho wholly unassuming even humble -- that I ever encountered"" Melville wrote. If Melville had lived another three decades hed have seen himself become an impressive man too credited posthumously with writing the Great American Epic. And if he were alive today hed spend a chunk of his 1200 lifetime earnings from Moby-Dick on a ticket to Ron Howards In the Heart of the Sea a retelling of the Essexs doomed voyage. There he would look up at the screen at Benjamin Walkers Pollard and wonder ""What the hell did they do to my pal?""Film Details In the Heart of the Sea RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time121 min. More Info Trailer This isnt a bad thing. Moby-Dick was a story of fever and obsession. Howard and screenwriter Charles Leavitt basing their script off of Nathaniel Philbricks original book are interested in something more cynically modern corporate greed. Pollard has been rejiggered to represent nepotism and ego as an inexperienced captain who bought his way into a job and would rather put his sailors at risk than return home looking incompetent. (As fictional insults go that isnt any worse than Melville transforming him into Ahab.) His foil is first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) a romance novel-worthy hunk who looks like Fabio and acts like Superman. The first day at sea a sail gets tangled and Pollard watches weakly as Chase glides up the mast leaps over the rigging and swashbuckles the Essex free. Instead of a thank-you Pollard announces that Chase is the son of a convict. Forget the whale -- the real fight is snobs versus jocks.Pollard and Chases rivalry sets the tone of the film. But Howard continually reminds us that its the big business of blubber that steers the ship. Whale oil kept the lamps lit and the machines running and Howard lines the cityscape of New Bedford Massachusetts the capital port of the industry with huffing smokestacks. ""Without us without you the whole world plunges into darkness"" declares Pollards dad and if the Essexs pressure to power America makes you think of modern-day coal miners and oil drillers men who brave bad conditions and hostile lands for retrograde fuel thats deliberate.

Sep. 13 600pm As a framing device In the Heart of the Sea has Melville (Ben Whishaw) interviewing Essex survivor Thomas Nickerson played by Brendan Gleeson a welcome talent. Melville and Nickersons scenes have the aura of a dying mans final confession with Gleeson looking like such a weary bear that it seems impossible that in the flashbacks that make up the bulk of the film just 30 years ago he was teenage Tom Holland. Nickersons quarters are decorated with toy boats in airless bottles the trappings of a man still desperate to tame the dangers of the sea.With good reason. The Essex wasnt just hunting whales. It was hunting sperm whales carnivores with teeth like bowie knives and the largest brain of any animal living or extinct. The big white sperm whale they chase is as scarred as Freddy Krueger (the real-life ""Mocha Dick"" that inspired Melville had outlasted a hundred whaling ships) each cut a lesson that humans arent friends. Still the whale is the villain of the film. Howard shoots its serial-killer p.o.v. gazing blurrily up at these fragile men leagues away from land; at one point it surfaces with a fury that had me gigglingly recalling Jaws IV. Yet you cant look at those scars without wondering if in the whale version of Hollywood Moby Dick is the ultimate Final Girl. His vengeance is justified -- these men murdered his friends. And when the Essex stabs its first whale guilt flickers across Chases face as if he knows it too. EXPAND In the Heart of the Sea draws on the same real-life events as Moby-Dick. Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures Howard is great at capturing the timbre of the ship the creaks and snaps and the whir of the hemp lines and the sonar clicks of the whales strategizing below. All his sound and fury has a befuddling purpose. His emotional climax is about well disaster insurance. A possibly apocryphal Nathaniel Hawthorne quotation at the end calls Moby-Dick ""Americas epic"" which in an age with 10000 times more lawyers than sailors means Howards tweaks make a sardonic sense. Still you sense his crowd-pleasers need to turn Melvilles dark musings into a tidy 21st-century story of heroism the sort of thing that earns more than 1200. Never mind that Chase the movies golden god was the real reason the Essexs lifeboats sailed east toward starvation. In actuality Pollard wanted to go west toward the nearby Marquesas but Chase ironically was afraid of cannibals.Chase wrote his own retelling of the disaster the year after he returned home titled Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex of Nantucket; Which Was Attacked and Finally Destroyed by a Large Spermaceti-Whale in the Pacific Ocean; With an Account of the Unparalleled Sufferings of the Captain and Crew During a Space of Ninety-Three Days at Sea in Open Boats in the Years 1819 amp; 1820. It would take 30 years for Melville to reshape it into the slightly more tersely titled The Whale (soon renamed Moby-Dick) and another 70 for anyone to realize why this doomed voyage mattered.Today 195 years after the Essex set sail were still fascinated by this struggle between men money and nature. Thats because were still fighting that battle on a hundred fronts climate change drilling industrialized farming even overfishing. Which means this old deadly whale had better scare us into making peace with the environment or neither of us will survive.IN THE HEART OF THE SEA | Directed by Ron Howard | Written by Charles Leavitt based on the book In the Heart of the Sea The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex by Nathaniel Philbrick | Warner Bros. | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Mark Vancleave Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is the story of an ambitious endeavor gone out of control. And so is the film. It is a cinematic shipwreck of epic scale. A flotilla of failure. It stinks as it sinks. Following a doomed New England whaling expedition in warlike combat with a vengeful behemoth the movie feels as ill-starred as the beleaguered crew. Every surge of misguided acting choppy editing and dismal cinematography deserves a loud shout of ""Thar she blows"" And really at this late date what else can we say about a film starring Chris Hemsworth? Hes the 21st centurys Steve Reeves. Hemsworths ridiculously well-developed musculature makes him capable as Marvels mighty Thor but puny in all roles needing a performers dramatic grace. There is no use for staggering pectoral muscles in his role here. Hemsworth plays Owen Chase first mate on a seafaring expedition for a bountiful whale harvest. He becomes the instant antagonist to the highborn inexperienced captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker from ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter""). The pair fight with vinegary verbal sparring not the comic book mano-a-mano that Hemsworth has mastered. While the Irish and British cast members Brendan Gleeson Cillian Murphy and Ben Whishaw hide their accents for their American roles the Australian Hemsworth sounds deep resonant and miscast. In 1820 Nantucket Mass. was a key source of the sperm whale oil used to fuel lanterns lamps and other lighting devices internationally. That year the towns whaleship Essex was hunted and attacked by a huge sperm whale in the South Pacific. Swimming at and ramming the ship twice it shattered the hull rapidly sinking the Essex and decimating the crew. Adrift for 90 days 2000 miles west of South America the two dozen starving survivors resorted to cannibalism. Few lived. The event partly inspired Herman Melvilles novel ""Moby-Dick"" but this sort of seagoing Donner Party horror story is not the type of film usually released for matinees in the family-focused holiday season. Ron Howards vision presents the sailors largely as human parasites filling wide swaths of seawater with the red blood of slaughtered whales before the turnabout. With little time spent defining the human characters it plays like a revenge saga starring a gigantic 160000-pound leviathan. Warner Bros. Chris Hemsworth puts the hammer down. Loosely based on Nathaniel Philbricks 2000 National Book Award-winning novel the film is a slapdash mix of fiction and fact. In an ill-conceived framing device Whishaw plays a youngish Melville trying to convince Gleesons Tom Nickerson an aged survivor of the tragedy to share the details he has long guarded as a secret. The pair usually fine actors are trapped here in extended walk-on cameos that feel like 11th-hour repairs to a broken script. The two story lines set 30 years apart repeatedly bring their text subtext and context to head-butting collisions with Gleeson narrating at length events his character never witnessed. Perhaps those cockeyed shifts of perspective are to give us a feeling of seasick identification with the seamen. How else could Howard have assembled the visuals with so many heaving diagonal slippery images? Why else would the imposing special effects look like such slipshod make-believe? Steven Spielberg did a much better job with a malfunctioning mechanical shark in ""Jaws."" ""In the Heart of the Sea"" has a bigger boat but it is lesser in every manner that matters. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

The film tells the true story that inspired Moby-Dick. VPCChris Hemsworth stars in Ron Howards film about the Essex a doomed whaling ship whose final journey helped inspire ""Moby-Dick."" The elements for a great film are here but it falls short.The whale attacks in Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures action adventure ""In the Heart of the Sea"" distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.(Photo Warner Bros.)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 stars out of 5Chris Hemsworth is good playing an experienced sailor and his is the only character with any developmentThe effects that create the whale and its environs are numerous and impressive though not quite seamlessRon Howards ""In the Heart of the Sea"" based on the real-life whaling disaster that inspired ""Moby-Dick"" is long on sea and short on heart and its a bit of a mystery why.The story is compelling enough -- men and the sea an ocean monster and the incredible will to survive against inhuman circumstances -- and the cast is good. Chris Hemsworth is manly and burly and embodies all the qualities his character should. Yet we dont invest in him and root for him so much as simply watch him observers with no overwhelming interest.Though the whale seems pretty cool.Its a film worth seeing in fact for the whale and for the effects that create it and its environs. Howards use of those effects is not quite as seamless as it was in say ""Apollo 13"" (the liftoff sequences were created on a computer for instance though youd never know it) but neither is it jarring. We never doubt the enormity or ferocity of the beast nor the trials of the men who unwisely went hunting for it. We just dont live and die by the outcome.USA TODAYTimeline North Korea and the Sony Pictures hackA greater tale serves as the framing device. Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) is aware of the legend of the Essex the Nantucket whaling ship that met disaster in 1820. Now 30 years later Melville shows up at the home of Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) the last living survivor hungry for details for a novel he is writing. Nickerson has never told his story not even to his wife (Michelle Fairley) who is more than willing to let Melville pay them the last of his money in exchange for an evening talking with her husband. For all these years Nickerson drank and tried to forget but guilt weighs heavily on him.He tells of being a boy (played by Tom Holland) whose voyage on the Essex would be his first trip to sea. The ship was captained by George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) a greenhorn chosen on the basis of his name not his non-existent experience. This infuriates Owen Chase (Hemsworth) the experienced sailor who was promised a ship to captain. Yet given the promise that next time he will captain a vessel he agrees to the trip. They dont give Pollard a black hat and Chase a white one but they might as well have.AZCENTRALChris Hemsworth is shipshape in the Heart of the SeaThey get a crew together and head out to sea looking for whales. Whale oil is what the world runs on; underground oil wouldnt be discovered for a generation or more. Thirst for oil is by no means a recent phenomenon as Howard goes to pains to point out. It leads to rash decisions and tragedy.But its Pollards hubris stubbornness and jealousy of Chases experience that leads him to send the Essex into a storm damaging the ship. Yet he wont return to Nantucket; instead they press on. They find some whales and Howard explores the violent bloody and sometimes thrilling business of killing and preparing one. (The young Nickerson has to squeeze through the blowhole to get the last of the oil from a whale; its a disgusting business he remembers well years later.)AZCENTRALIn the Heart of the Sea (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsA brief trip ashore leads to the search for waters where whales are plentiful -- and rumors of a giant one. The Essex finds it or maybe it finds the Essex. A battle follows but really its not much of a fight. The destruction and devastation at the end of this encounter is nearly complete; the surviving men wind up in small boats floating thousands of miles from home. We see them wait bake in the sun make unthinkable decisions to survive (thus Nickersons lifelong guilt).A whale of a tale no doubt (sorry). But there is a coldness to it. Only Chase gets any backstory that we actually see and we dont see much of that. The characters are too stock to make a lasting impression (though you hope that even as things grow increasingly dire on-the-wagon second mate played by Cillian Murphy wont open the bottle of whiskey hes toting around). The images are impressive. But the characters and their development leave something to be desired.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Close Join the conversation... On Facebook With Chris Vognar Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh First things first I havent read Moby-Dick. If that doesnt sound like an egregious enough crime consider that I was also an English major. The shame. Ill be over here swabbing the decks.We address the great white whale apropos of In the Heart of the Sea the new seafaring adventure based on Nathan Philbricks popular nonfiction book. Herman Melville is actually a character in the movie played by an earnest Ben Whishaw in a framing story that darts in and out of the main action. The scribe wants to write a book about the Essex a whaling ship that met a nasty end in the Pacific Ocean back in 1820. Melville has located the last survivor of the expedition (the great Brendan Gleeson). And so we set sail on the Sea of Flashback. Directed by good Hollywood soldier Ron Howard In the Heart of the Sea is everything you might expect and a little bit less. Its solid if rarely spectacular engaging if rarely engrossing. The herky-jerky pace suggests someone told Howard to trim the sails by about a half-hour; the efficiently told story has trouble building sustained moments of visual poetry or visceral terror.Heaven knows theres plenty to fear from the vengeful mammal that inspires the bulk of the movies awe to the human debasement of excessive pride and even worse cannibalism. The film is at its best delineating the conflict between Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) the cocky Essex first mate of humble origins and George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) the Nantucket blue blood captain whose rigidity doesnt exactly inspire respect among the crew.But the adversaries have a few things in common. Theyre both greedy for whale oil the coin of the realm in 19th-century New England. Theyre both sure theyre always right. And their chest-puffing obstinacy is but a bubble in the ocean compared to the rage of nature represented by a massive and massively determined sperm whale. The whale is the movies MVP from the moment he arrives after the Essex makes an ill-advised jaunt to a remote part of the Pacific. At first the men cant believe their good fortune The trip has been a bit of a bust and heres a veritable sea of whales ready for the harpoon. (Greenpeace will not dig In the Heart of the Sea.) Then the big guy shows up filling the screen like the imperial Star Destroyer at the beginning of Star Wars.The seaborne cinematography is adequate enough especially once the Essex crew is split off into smaller boats and the men get a sense of the vastness loneliness and hunger before them. The wreckage of the Essex provides some of the films most lyrical passages as we get an underwater view of the detritus complete with whale oil catching fire beneath the surface.In the Heart of the Sea is a dark tale told in a highly PG-13 manner. It doesnt approach the deep-rooted dread of another upcoming survival tale The Revenant nor does it probe very deeply into the true storys heart of darkness. In someone elses hands In the Heart of the Sea might have left viewers shaken and gasping for land. What Howard and screenwriter Charles Leavitt have provided is a serviceable Hollywood product with a redemptive Herman Melville cameo.Not that I begrudge Melville whose immortal whaling epic was actually a flop until after his death (a fact the film neglects to mention). Im just not sure he belongs as a character in this particular movie. Of course you can take that with a grain of sea salt coming from someone who hasnt yet met Ishmael.In the Heart of the Sea (B-) Directed by Ron Howard.

Chris Hemsworth stars in Ron Howards film which purports to tell the story that inspired ""Moby-Dick."" Photo Jonathan Prime Associated Press In the Heart of the Sea a very slow boat 1 / 1 Back to Gallery With ""In the Heart of the Sea"" director Ron Howard has given us a painstakingly crafted bore a lovingly rendered snooze and a very expensive means by which audiences can experience restless leg syndrome before being carted off to the land of happy slumber. But its not his fault. The movie purports to tell the real story that inspired the writing of Herman Melvilles ""Moby-Dick"" and like most real stories backstories and origin stories its just not as enjoyable as the fake story. Lets just say it If you buy a ticket hoping to see a whale bite off a guys leg you will not go home happy. Instead what youll get is a predictable disaster-at-sea story that follows the pattern of all disaster-at-sea stories with guys floating in still water under a hot sun getting so hungry that they start looking at each other with funny expressions. The movie is in 3-D which adds nothing to the experience besides making you realize that Chris Hemsworth looks even taller in three dimensions than two. He plays the first officer and inevitably the movie tells the story from the first officers point of view (i.e. the captain doesnt have a clue). The crews goal is to go out to the sea for about two years and kill enough whales to bring home 2000 gallons of whale oil. For those counting at home a big whale brings in about 40 gallons so thats 50 whales or a little more than two whales a month. Its an interesting fact -- interesting in a way that facts become interesting when there is little else to latch onto -- that in the 1820s the whaling business was the oil business. Whale oil was used to light homes and streets. The movie makes parallels between the oil business of 1820 and the oil business of today in the sense that the people running either are just not very nice. But this becomes a bit of a problem not only in terms of how we see these 1820s businessmen but how we see their employees. For example did you know that success in a whale hunt is signaled by the sight of blood coming out of the whales blowhole? Thats when all the guys cheer. After seeing ""In the Heart of the Sea"" you may feel a need to cleanse yourself with a return visit to ""Star Trek IV The Voyage Home."" Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) appears in the opening sequence and here and there throughout as a young writer in search of a hot story. He has heard rumors and legends about what brought down the Essex a whaling ship and so he travels to meet the last surviving crew member who has spent every minute since trying to drink away the memory. (If you see the movie thats what you might want to do too.) The interaction of Whishaw and of Brendan Gleeson as one of the survivors is the films best element in that the emotional dynamic is the hardest to predict. But it makes up a small part of the action. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com Twitter MickLaSalle In the Heart of the Sea Action-adventure.

Share Tweet Herman Melville onetime sailor never set foot on Nantucket before publishing Moby-Dick but in In The Heart Of The Sea--which adapts Nathaniel Philbricks non-fiction book about the Essex whaleship disaster as a hokey origin story for Melvilles novel--he arrives on the island hoping to find the man who had been the Essexs cabin boy and turn his account of a ship rammed by a sperm whale into a book. The man in question Thomas Nickerson is only supposed to be in his mid-40s at this point but this being the rough times of the 19th century he has prematurely aged into a gruff cranky Brendan Gleeson. And so as Melville (Ben Whishaw) scratches away at paper with his mother-of-pearl pen Nickerson yammers out his story about a journey to that part of the sea ""where knowledge ended and speculation began"" and of vindictive whales one-armed Spaniards and sailors forced to resort to cannibalism. Scripted by Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond K-Pax) In The Heart Of The Sea is utterly bogus as a re-telling of the Essex story--which did provide some inspiration for Moby-Dick--and as a commentary on Melvilles classic and downright ravishing as a vision of the sea drawing on two centuries of maritime art from J.M.W. Turners paintings to Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Verena Paravels documentary Leviathan. So visually busy and creatively confident that youd hardly believe Ron Howard directed it the movie churns with color-scape skies and abstracted cuts to strained riggings and whale viscera while murky waters and old glass make ripples in the foreground of the 3-D frame. Whalers faces are flecked by jets of blood after a harpooning a flintlock sinks into the ocean after a sailors suicide Melvilles pen dips into an inkwell like an anchor ripping into seabed--if In The Heart Of The Sea has its share of clunks and groans it also looks suspiciously like bona fide big-screen art.In what could be called the ""1990s Mel Gibson role"" Chris Hemsworth plays first mate Owen Chase who is passed over for a promised captaincy in favor of the untested George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) causing a rivalry. (In real life the two had served together for years on the Essex before being promoted though this change is relatively small for a movie whose ending makes A Beautiful Mind seem factual in comparison.) From here the audience is introduced to the rest of the crew including second mate Matthew Joy (Cillian Murphy in a limited but poignant role) the adolescent Thomas Nickerson (Tom Holland) and Pollards portentously named cousin Owen Coffin (Frank Dillane) re-christened ""Henry"" because no two characters in a movie can have the same first name. Hit early on by a squall--which begins as a painterly smear before swelling into extravagant waves of effects--the Essex finds itself still short of its sperm whale quota a year later and sails for an unmapped part of the Pacific where it will be rammed and sunk forcing the survivors to spend months at sea. Leavitts screenplay chucks out much of whats weird about the Essex story (say the bit where the crew caused the extinction of a tortoise species by accidentally setting an island on fire) in favor of a mushy hubris parable outfitted with a corny subplot about a corporate cover-up. It doesnt matter a whole lot given how Howard and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle mainline the inherent drama of the sea. Here Turner-esque horizons hover behind decks bloody with sperm whale brain matter and a man swims from a burning shipwreck carrying muskets--bluntly symbolic of both violence and ingenuity--while fire and water both elemental forces square off behind him. Disorienting tight shots (a harpoon line wrapping around a sperm whales tail a figure with bowling-ball breasts being carved in scrimshaw a dead whales eye reflecting men a la Werckmeister Harmonies etc.) punctuate matte-painting-like digital vistas creating a constantly swaying sense of scale as though the whole movie were being continually rocked by a storm of artistic impulses. Which is to say that even though In The Heart Of The Seas framing device often feels like it was written by someone whod never read a word of Melville its visual style makes for a bold approximation of his allusive prose.Howard an often proficient director of mostly good-looking movies hasnt shown this much ambition since Far And Away a movie that similarly took inspiration from the kind of sweeping hokum Hollywood used to do well. The difference with his new film is that its 1950s luster is in competition with an impressionistic palette of close-ups creating a dynamic. Sometimes--as in the introduction of the older Nickerson seated under a ceiling hung with hundreds of empty glass jugs--In The Heart Of The Sea seems to speak the language of visual simile and metaphor that defined the last years of silent film. Perhaps its best seen with a mental mute button.

Ron Howards Briny Seafaring Epic Is a Whale of a Tale | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters movies Ron Howards Briny Seafaring Epic Is a Whale of a Tale Based on the events that inspired Moby Dick By Rex Reed  12/08/15 450pm In the Heart of the Sea. Ron Howard is such a skillful director that his enthusiasm for a ho-hum action project like In the Heart of the Sea can elevate otherwise familiar subject matter above the usual torpor with a visual splendor that may very well expand audience interest. Reunited with poster boy Chris Hemsworth the latest flavor of fan-magazine beefcake fodder and blank-faced star of the directors 2013 flop Rush Mr. Howard has pieced together a briny seafaring epic about the sinking of a whaling vessel called the Essex in 1820 by an angry whale that inspired Herman Melvilles saltwater classic Moby Dick. Bring your own lifeboat. IN THE HEART OF THE SEA  (2/4 stars) Written by Charles Leavitt Directed by Ron Howard Starring Chris Hemsworth Cillian Murphy and Brendan Gleeson Running time 121 min. Already tackled (disastrously) on the Broadway stage by Orson Welles in two movies--most notably the 1930 original with John Barrymore and John Hustons famous 1956 remake with Gregory Peck as a stoic Captain Ahab and a memorable screenplay by Ray Bradbury--as well as a 1998 TV mini-series with Patrick Stewart there isnt much point in shooting yet another version of the Melville yarn. So Mr. Howard concentrates instead on the 19th century political chaos and social snobbery that pitted the egos of two disparate men--the well-born but inexperienced Captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) and the ambitious working-class first mate Owen Chase (Mr. Hemsworth) who was better qualified for the job but lacked the credentials financial backing and family influence--against each other and against a demonic ocean creature more powerful than both of them put together. Nothing much happens until the whale shows up and when it does it steals the movie. The true story is related in flashback when Melville (Ben Whishaw) interviews the sole survivor of the Essex (Brendan Gleeson) in 1850 as research for his unpublished novel which turned out to be Moby Dick. As the narrative begins to take shape in the authors mind the film reveals what really happened when the rivalry of two men was interrupted by the lethal attack of a nasty beast the size of Nantucket that seems hell-bent on revenge for the years of carnage visited upon good whales everywhere by the whale-oil industry. The action sequences are well photographed the waves engulf the viewer like theres no tomorrow and you do feel like you are part of the ships damnation as the Essex burns like firewood sending the crew to their graves in the darkness of the ocean floor and leaving only four survivors stranded at sea for 90 days. They were miraculously rescued off the coast of Chile and then the return voyage took another three months. Its a harrowing tale that still packs an entertaining wallop. But any attempt at character development seems to have ended on an editing-room table. I didnt see it in 3-D but In the Heart of the Sea is a movie that would probably benefit from all those technical effects designed to show off the swash and buckle that take the place of human emotions. Despite all the brio and brawn the screenplay by Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond) based on the non-fiction best seller by Nathaniel Philbrick makes little impact. There are aspects afloat reminiscent of the great 1946 sea epic Two Years Before the Mast but  Chris Hemsworth is no Alan Ladd. He is to the majesty of a ship at sea what a clamshell is to the bottom of a canoe.

"In the Heart of the Sea (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review In the Heart of the Sea (PG-13) The fateful hunt for a white whale starring Chris Hemsworth. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/10/2015 Editor rating 2 In the Heart of the Sea is a savage story of survival encased in Ron Howard amber -- the gooey dull coating of self-importance and respectability that typifies most of the pictures he has directed (Apollo 13 The Da Vinci Code A Beautiful Mind Frost/Nixon). In his previous film 2013s Rush Howard seemed to be reinventing himself using the story of the rivalry between two Formula One drivers as the foundation for a dynamic furious movie. Rush felt like the work of a filmmaker breaking free of his old habits and trying out new things It was brash and stylish and invigorating. In the Heart of the Sea is none of those things. The movie is an adaptation of Nathaniel Philbricks nonfiction book about the doomed voyage of the Whaleship Essex in 1819 a stranger-than-fiction story that was one of the inspirations Herman Melville used to write Moby-Dick. The film uses a flashback structure starting in 1850 when one of the survivors (Brendan Gleeson) recounts the horrors he witnessed to an awestruck Melville (Ben Whishaw). Those scenes which Howard cuts back to periodically are stodgy and plodding pedestrian bits of exposition that with one critical exception feel like nothing more than screenwriter Charles Leavitts solution to jumping over large patches of time (the tribulations the sailors of the Essex endured from start to finish spread over two years). The only moment in the film in which Gleesons narration doesnt come off as an intrusion is when the story takes an astonishingly grisly turn and Howard careful to respect that PG-13 rating wisely tells instead of showing. Although the trailers make In the Heart of the Sea looks like a grand family-friendly adventure parents unfamiliar with the real story should know certain things happen in the movie that could be difficult to explain to young children. In the Heart of the Sea comes to life once the Essex sets sail. The focus is on first mate Owen Chase (played by Chris Hemsworth and his magnificent hair which blows photogenically in the wind) and the inexperienced cabin boy Thomas Nickerson (Tom Holland soon to be seen playing Spider-Man) who doesnt yet have his sea legs. The captain (Benjamin Walker) is an officious dullard. The second mate (Cillian Murphy) is a teetotaler. The captains younger cousin (Frank Dillane) is a sycophant. This is the sort of movie in which every character is given one easily identifiable trait so you can tell them apart once the special effects take over and the whales attack. About those special effects The computer-generated images in In the Heart of the Sea look so blatantly fake you have to give Howard the benefit of the doubt and assume he was going for an artificial storybook feel like Spielberg did in the opening 15 minutes of War Horse. How else to explain the CGI dolphins that look like they swam over from Finding Nemo or the open-sea skies that look like velvet paintings youd find at a Motel 6? Once you make peace with them the effects are fine -- the sequence in which a mammoth white whale rams the Essex is well done and appropriately terrifying -- until the critical scene late in the film in which the actors sport some makeup so jaw-droppingly awful audiences could well break into laughter. The story of In the Heart of the Sea is strong enough to overcome everything Howard does to ruin it even a completely fictional scene in which the ""demon whale"" turns into the shark from Jaws The Revenge and comes looking for payback. A long sequence depicting a successful whale catch and the messy business that follows would please Melville (its gross and wet work this whaling stuff). But you come away from the movie lamenting the missed opportunity and wondering what a stronger bolder filmmaker would have done with this material. If you want to see a great movie about survival in the wild wait for The Revenant. If the true story of the Essex fascinates you then try to see In the Heart of the Sea on the biggest screen possible. The tale is here although torn and battered by bad dialogue (""How does a man come to know the unknowable?"") and Howards pedestrian direction. His is a career that continues to take on water like the Essex Glug glug glug.

By Preston Jonespjonesdfw.comPosted 1200am on Thursday Dec. 10 2015 Thursday Dec. 10 2015 Wednesday Dec. 09 2015 By Preston Jones Fort Worth Star-Telegram A 19th century yarn told in a distinctly 21st century fashion In the Heart of the Sea should sail with ease instead of listing to an unsatisfying destination.To be sure director Ron Howard marshals some intense inventively filmed sequences of an ATamp;T Stadium-sized sperm whale wreaking havoc upon hapless sailors. But theres also a peculiar sense of the film taking both far too long and not nearly long enough to put the audience right in the thick of the maritime action.The film is being sold more or less as ""the true story behind Herman Melvilles Moby Dick"" and thats precisely the framing device Howard and screenwriter Charles Leavitt employ dispatching Melville (Ben Whishaw) to pry loose the astonishing tale of a vengeful whale from Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) over the course of a dark and stormy night.Toggling between past and present its not long before we glimpse the brawny visage of Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth re-teaming with Howard who directed him in 2013s underrated Rush) preparing to set sail on the newly refurbished whaling vessel Essex albeit as a begrudging first mate. Having been promised the rank of captain Chase is passed over in favor of the blue-blooded George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) with whom he clashes almost immediately.The tension between the two men gives Sea what little spark it has early on as the voyage to secure precious whales oil -- the economic lifeblood of 1820s Nantucket -- begins with the young Nickerson (played as a child by Tom Holland) joining the motley crew. Although the film desperately strives to achieve the salt-stained realism of say Peter Weirs 2003 beautifully rough-hewn epic Master amp; Commander The Far Side of the World In the Heart of the Sea falls far short of such lofty goals. To begin with the exclusively digital filmmaking process gives Sea a disconcertingly anachronistic feel -- shooting on actual film might have alleviated this. But with that said there are some truly breathtaking images here particularly during the Canary Islands sunsets. ( Sea also takes full advantage of 3-D technology plunging the camera under the water and hoisting it high atop the mast often to dizzying effect.) Sea also suffers a crippling deficiency of pathos particularly toward the climax as the surviving crew members are forced to contemplate unspeakable actions to survive being set adrift by the great white whale. There are moments such as when Chase is faced with abandoning a friend where Howard tries to jerk tears that have not been earned. Hemsworth does what he can with the role but both he and Walker are playing cliches not characters. In the Heart of the Sea is ultimately a film with vast ambitions but which would be better served if it were even half as deep as the ocean upon which it unfolds.

EntertainmentMovies In the Heart of the Sea Special effects keep whale tale afloat Originally published December 10 2015 at 1205 am Updated December 10 2015 at 1203 pm Movie review of ""In the Heart of the Sea"" There is something curiously flat about Ron Howards recounting of the final voyage of a 19th-century whale ship which inspired Herman Melville to write ""Moby-Dick."" Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer ""In the Heart of the Sea"" would seem to have all the elements of a rousing yarn doughty seafarers serving in hard circumstances before the mast a ship tempest-tossed amid towering waves a scarred white leviathan from ""the deep blue unknown"" (in the words of a crewman) on a vessel-shattering rampage. And all of it based on actual events. Yet there is something curiously flat about Ron Howards recounting of the final voyage of the ill-fated 19th-century whale ship the Essex. The story of the Essex rammed by a huge sperm whale on Nov. 20 1820 and abandoned by its crew before eventually sinking in the Pacific 2000 miles from the coast of South America is a grim and gruesome one. But the main characters -- first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) and the captain George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) -- are less than compelling and minor-character crewmen aboard are not well delineated. Movie Review 1/2   In the Heart of the Sea with Chris Hemsworth Benjamin Walker Ben Whishaw Tom Holland Brendan Gleeson. Directed by Ron Howard from a screenplay by Charles Leavitt based on a book by Nathaniel Philbrick. 122 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and peril brief startling violence and thematic material. Several theaters. The costumes and settings look authentic enough but there is the hint of the museum about them. Particularly at the pictures start you get the sense youre looking at a diorama rather than a realistic smoky bustling seaport on the island of Nantucket Mass. center of the whaling industry in the early 1800s.

The sinking of the Essex is accompanied by fire and explosions that blow the ship to pieces and look very dramatic as they light up the night sky. However in the nonfiction best-seller by Nathaniel Philbrick on which the movie is based there are no flames or blasts and the wreck stayed afloat for at least a day. The whale special effects computer-generated of course are genuinely spectacular. Schools of enormous creatures -- breaching and spouting sliding across the glistening surface of the sea and propelling themselves powerfully beneath the surface -- are the most impressive sights in movie particularly when viewed on a giant IMAX screen in 3D. If theres a theater in your area that offers those two options see ""In the Heart of the Sea"" there. Adrift for weeks in three small open whale boats with little food or water the Essex survivors slowly starve and start to die. And once the dying begins the living reluctantly do what they feel they must to survive; they eat the dead. Powerful stuff which Howard handles in a manner that could best be described as decorous. The grisly reality of the crews desperate decision is not shown but rather is reluctantly recounted in terse terms 30 years later by a character who was a teen at the time of the sinking (Tom Holland) but now a middle-aged man (Brendan Gleeson) burdened by his guilty memories. He tells it to Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) avidly scratching away with his pen who having heard of the Essex has come to Nantucket to gather insights and background for a novel he plans soon to write ""Moby-Dick."" The central conflict in the plot is between Chase and Pollard. They are at odds because Chase a veteran whale man is resentful that Pollard relatively inexperienced but a member of a prominent island family has been given the command once promised to Chase but withdrawn because he wasnt Nantucket-born. Their squabble seems small beer for such an epic tale. The slaughter of the whales does eventually give Chase pause and he speculates that maybe the attack was natures way of avenging itself on puny humans. Howard underscores the point by having the whale stalk the crew in their boats after the sinking. (Not factual.) Its an overobvious metaphor one more flaw in a picture that has a lot of them.

(Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture) BY Stephen Whitty NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday December 9 2015 400 AM Title In the Heart of the Sea Film Info With Chris Hemsworth Benjamin Walker. Chris Hemsworth goes fishing and ends up a Thor loser. Director Ron Howard. (201). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. ""In the Heart of the Sea"" doesnt know ""Moby-Dick"" about maritime adventure. Herman Melvilles doorstop of a book was about obsession and how it twists you. It had a tragic hero at its core and a huge beast -- hows that for a metaphor? -- as a villain. This movie has Chris Hemsworth in between ""Avengers"" movies and a lot of computer-generated sea life. It uses a lot of fancy lures but it never hooks you. Based on the Nathaniel Philbrick best-seller its actually the story of the real-life whales tale that inspired Melvilles classic. Thank you. No youre whale chum (Courtesy Warner Bros. Entertainm) But whats here isnt novel at all - just some all-at-sea cliches about an incompetent captain his charismatic first mate and a disaster in the making. Its ""The Caine Mutiny"" in puffy shirts. Bland Benjamin Walker is the rich kid whos been handed the captains job; hunky Hemsworth is the experienced sailor who really deserved it. Stuck with each other they set sail from 1820s Nantucket in search of whales. But then a great white one finds them and starts its own hunt. After the ship is sunk in ""In the Heart of the Sea"" not much else happens. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Its a good story which is why Melville used it but without Ahab its just an old fish tale with manly men shouting commands and fighting computer-generated animals. Call me unimpressed. The great white sinks their ship and leaves them drifting with so little food and water that even scrawny cabin boys start looking tasty. But after the ship is kaput theres not much more to look at. The characters never move much beyond the stereotypes working-class hero upper-class twit. And director Ron Howard keeps interrupting things for ecology lessons and lectures on evil fuel companies. (The whales were being turned into lamp oil after all.) Sure Hemsworth looks great and the whales attacks are genuinely exciting. And some of the everyday details of life at sea are fascinating too if disgusting. But sorry maties but this is the one that got away.

"Review Heart of the Sea a solid return to Moby-Dick legend - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Heart of the Sea a solid return to Moby-Dick legendBy Tony Hicksthicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 12/08/2015 021200 PM PSTUpdated 12/09/2015 054834 PM PST Ron Howard is as reliable as the sun coming up every morning.The director knows as much as anyone alive about telling classically American stories through film. He hung around Andy Griffith and the Disney studios as a child. He played a 1950s-60s-era teenager on TV and for George Lucas on the big screen. He worked with James Stewart and John Wayne when he was in his 20s.So who better to make a movie about the harrowing 1820s whaling voyage that inspired Herman Melville to write ""Moby-Dick""? ""In the Heart of the Sea"" isnt a great movie -- outside of the beautiful presentation and great action scenes theres nothing magical or overly inspirational here. Its a solid highly polished rock of filmmaking with just enough modern technology to keep a 21st-century audience interested in a 19th-century story. A scene from In the Heart of the Sea. (Warner Bros. Pictures) ( Warner Bros. Pictures ) Writer Herman Melville (Ben Whishaw) comes to Nantucket to find the last living sailor of a doomed whaling voyage spanning two oceans and nearly two years. Legend has it the disaster was caused by a giant white whale that not only defended its pod by attacking the ship but also took vengeance on the survivors over a number of weeks as they tried to make their way in lifeboats toward land.In the decades since the sole survivor and youngest member of the crew Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) has never discussed the dark memories that drove him to drink. Melville gets him to talk and the flashbacks begin with whaler Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) going to sea as the first mate of the Essex captained by the less-experienced but better-connected George Pollard (Benjamin Walker).Advertisement The conflict between the two men is set up but never fully explored as Howard doesnt dig deeply into either characters potentially dark nature. And thats not the only area where Howard and writers Charles Leavitt Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver tread a little cautiously. ""Heart of the Sea"" after all is a movie about killing whales but this is partly absolved by its being very much a story of its time -- Capt. Pollards assertion that whales are mere resources on a planet bequeathed to man by God wouldnt raise an eyebrow in 1820 and thus doesnt shock us in the context of the film. But even in 1820 right and wrong can enter the picture and ""Sea"" keeps most characters on the right side of any moral quandary. Howard avoids overemphasizing the cruelty of harpooning whales and shows similar restraint when the sailors have to resort to the most extreme actions to survive. There is one semihumorous scene in the film however when harvesting a whale requires the smallest member of the crew to actually crawl into the carcass.Portraying action on the high seas is where this movie excels pulling the audience in so thoroughly that the deck can almost be felt swaying below. Howard does a great job of making his cetacean protagonist fluid powerful and frightening. Almost as impressive he avoids making it seem too villainous or conversely too sympathetic. The whale is the storys lever elevating and revealing human traits and reactions.Hemsworth is Hemsworth -- a capable actor whose looks and bearing make him a natural for the role of a brave adventurer with a believable amount of conscience (though Im still trying to figure out what his accent is supposed to be). Tom Holland who will play Spider-Man in the next round of Marvel films ably handles the role of the younger Tom Nickerson while Cillian Murphy (""The Dark Knight"") is painfully good as Chases boyhood friend and second mate Matthew Joy.As worldwide pop culture gears up to repeatedly dive headfirst into theaters that feature a story about spaceships and lightsabers ""In the Heart of the Sea"" may provide a nice counterweight classic if slightly whitewashed storytelling set on Earth before anyone ever imagined what a rolling robot might look like.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.In the Heart of the sea    Rating PG-13 (intense action and suspense some thematic material)Cast Chris Hemsworth Benjamin Walker Cillian Murphy Brendan Gleeson Tom Holland Ben Whishaw Michelle FairleyDirector Ron HowardRunning time 2 hours 1 minuteOpens Dec. 11 in wide releasePrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overA Game of Thrones spin-off?

Have ye seen the Great White? Aye Capn hes right there clambering up the rigging with his shirt off. This salty seagoing adventure--based on the true(ish) story that inspired Moby-Dick--may sell itself as a Jaws-in-pantaloons tale of historical animal horror but the real star here isnt a CGI whale its Chris Hemsworths strapping six-pack as he rampages the high seas harpooning everything in sight. In adapting the legend of the Essex a Nantucket whaler that foundered in the Pacific after a run-in with a particularly aggressive leviathan Ron Howard clearly thinks he has a story that will appeal both to history buffs and action-movie enthusiasts. So hes steeped his film in period detail maritime command structures arguments over sailors legal obligations and the price and importance of whale oil. Still hes perfectly happy to drop all that at the first chance of a manly hull-splintering set piece. Its a strategy that doesnt always pay off. The dramatic scenes are a touch overcooked and there are moments when it feels like a particularly high-end school play with everyone shouting ""Avast"" and ""Ahoy"" like they really mean it. The action though is consistently impressive When man and beast go toe-to-tail your timbers will be truly well shivered.

The obvious answer is that hes one of Hollywoods most commercially dependable directors and has been for nearly five decades. But when you really start wrestling with the question it gets a little thorny. Is he the merry prankster of Night Shift and The Paper? The three-hankie sentimentalist behind Cocoon and Parenthood? The Oscar-courting purveyor of middlebrow prestige pictures like Cinderella Man and A Beautiful Mind? Or is he the four-quadrant populist behind rollicking adventures like Apollo 13 and The Da Vinci Code? Since his debut behind the camera with 1977s Grand Theft Auto the former freckle-faced child actor has directed 22 movies. And even if youve seen them all - especially if youve seen them all - you dont get any closer to defining what a ""Ron Howard movie"" is. Hes an artist without a school or discernable style. He wouldve been perfect under contract to a studio in the 40s. That sort of jack-of-all-trades dexterity is as impressive as it is rare. But it can also lead to movies that feel slightly workman-like and bland. Howards latest film In the Heart of the Sea isnt quite either of those things but it is missing some of the urgency and danger of the Nathaniel Philbrick bestseller its adapted from. Its light on personality and spark which is a bit of a problem for a white-knuckle whaling tale. Some of this obviously rests with the director. But it also falls at the feet of his leading man Chris Hemsworth who fails to muster the same sort of charisma he displayed in Howards last film Rush. Hes a strapping seafaring cipher. In the Heart of the Sea is the (mostly) real-life account of the Essex a Nantucket ship that was smashed to kindling by an enormous sperm whale that it was hunting in 1820. The sad fate of the Essexs crewmen who were stranded at sea for months and forced to resort to cannibalism was the basis of Herman Melvilles masterpiece Moby-Dick. In other words its a survival story - and one thats already holding itself to a pretty lofty standard. Howard and screenwriter Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond) embrace the storys place in literary history by bookending the adventure with a narrative device that has Melville himself (played by Ben Whishaw) interviewing the Essexs last living survivor Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) three decades after the tragedy allowing him to recount the story in flashback. Its a smart framing device especially since Gleeson primes us for a corker of a story with traumatized reluctance to tell it. But tell it he does. As the story rewinds to a time when the world ran on the priceless commodity of whale oil (years before we discovered how to sip it directly from the ground) we meet Nickersons younger greener cabin boy self (played by Tom Holland) as well as Hemsworths Owen Chase - the Essexs confident able first mate whose chowdah-thick accent is sketchy at best and who is also still smarting from being denied the ships command. Instead the rudder was handed to Benjamin Walkers George Pollard Jr. an untested captain who inherited the job because of his family name rather than experience. Thats all the foreshadowing we need to know that In the Heart of the Sea will be a clash between these two seamen whose heads are harder than a scrimshawed whale bone at least until the lethal leviathan surfaces. Right off the bat Pollard makes rookie mistakes. After steering directly into a storm and allowing his ship to take a beating Pollard refuses to return to Nantucket for repairs and defiantly heads out to deep waters after hearing improbable stories about a gigantic white whale that will bring in countless barrels of inky stinky crude. The whale hunting scenes are undeniably thrilling and at times unflinchingly brutal. But they also have a slick CGI patina that lessens their visceral impact. Youre always aware of the scenes artificiality. After the hulking alabaster beast cripples the Essex beyond repair and the men are forced to abandon ship and flee on smaller life boats the film becomes a survival story that will be especially impressive for folks who havent already seen last years Unbroken. Hemsworth Walker and in particular Cillian Murphy (as Chases trusty second mate) waste away in the sun turning into barely living flesh-and-bone ghosts. Like Moby-Dick In the Heart of the Sea is a story that dares to grapple with weighty themes greed vengeance and obsession for starters. But Howards film for all of its storytelling skill technical polish and rousing high-seas sequences never quite casts the spell it should. Its too polite to give us a real feeling of life or death. Its sense of danger is watered down.

TWITTER Ron Howards new movie starring Chris Hemsworth tells the story of the whaling voyage that helped inspire Herman Melville to write Moby-Dick. A sort of maritime Donner Party In the Heart of the Sea is a rugged but underwhelming true-life drama of a cursed 19th century whaling voyage. The hook here is that the journey of the Essex from Nantucket to the South Pacific in 1820 helped inspire Herman Melville to write Moby-Dick thirty years later; this is however only partially the case and hardly seems enough upon which to base a tragic tale driven partly by hubris and insecurity but mostly by very bad luck. Ron Howards film of Nathaniel Philbricks 2000 National Book Award for Nonfiction winner holds the interest but never generates white caps of excitement making this look like a holiday season also-ran for Warner Bros. In terms of recent cinema there are shades of Unbroken here as a significant stretch of the yarn involves men bobbing about in the Pacific Ocean thousands of miles from anywhere and forced to extreme measures to stay alive. If there is one epic survival tale that will prevail during this Christmas season it will likely be The Revenant rather than this one which could end up performing significantly better overseas than domestically. The adaptation by Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond) is a solid piece of traditional carpentry that would have passed muster at the Hollywood studios back in the late 30s or early 40s when this sort of high seas adventure based on famous books was most in vogue. The framing device of an author -- in this case the young Melville (Ben Whishaw) -- interviewing in 1850 the last surviving member of the ships crew Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) in order to flash back to the sorrowful events is the definition of old-school. That impression is only somewhat undercut by Howards second consecutive collaboration with rough-and-ready cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle who does his muscular best to evoke the spectacle of whalings heyday in a comprehensive manner. What Melville is after is the full lurid and true story of what happened to the hapless sailors who famously had their ship capsized by a white whale the size of which no one had ever seen. Like his late crewmates Nickerson has never spoken of what transpired thereafter and it takes a significant amount of cash for the nearly destitute older man to open up. But he does which is wherein lies the tale. Read more SNL Recap Chris Hemsworth Terrorizes the Cast Will Ferrell Returns In 1820 Nantucket was considered the whaling capital of the world; in some striking CGI vistas fronted by countless ships the town looks a lot larger than it does now. The men would sail off for a year or more and often meet new offspring for the first time upon their return. Thats the future that may be in store for headstrong seaman Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) who thinks he now deserves to captain the refurbished Essex but must settle for another stint as first mate in deference to the owners son George Pollard (Benjamin Walker) a young greenhorn being placed in command. When local sea behemoths prove elusive the undersized Essex moves on into the South Atlantic where the cry of ""Blow"" is finally heard and a whale is hauled in and processed. In one scene young Nickerson (Tom Holland) as the smallest one on board is ordered to descend into the malodorous innards of the beast to extract its most precious contents. For audiences unfamiliar with the past the economic primacy of whale oil and its importance in illuminating long dark nights is spelled out. A measure of personal drama is sustained via the resentment of the ultra-capable working class Chase for the silver-spooned Pollard who cant really pretend he knows what hes doing and at the first sign of adversity wants to return to port rather than toughing it out. But with whale sightings at a minimum the men proceed around Cape Horn and into the Pacific in their quest to stockpile 2000 pounds of oil. During a stop in Ecuador they hear tall tales of a ""demon"" whale thats sent at least one ship to its doom as well as of an abundance of whales a thousand leagues west. So after more than a year at sea they set off on a voyage to what Nickerson calls ""the edge of sanity."" Sure enough they find not just plenty of whales but The Big One theyve been hearing about which in a welcoming gesture slaps down its giant fluke and capsizes one of the launches. Its a monster alright a splotchy dark gray-and-white beast thats as long as Essex and makes a sound like Godzilla. And the way it peers at the men and their boat it would look to have something special in store for them. And indeed it does. After flapping its whale tail down a bit more the Essex capsizes and poor Captain Pollard has no choice but to abandon ship which forces the survivors onto the three remaining launches some 3000 miles from Easter Island the nearest known land. With precious little to eat or drink no sails or equipment and nothing to protect them from the elements the men just drift and after a month find a largely barren island where a couple of them elect to remain. For the rest one more month adrift becomes yet another and with it inevitable death and horror of horrors cannibalism under duress. And through it all the giant whale still has them in its sights. In the end this isnt anything near the tale that Melville told; its merely a story of great personal misfortune and tragedy rather than one that trades in such lofty matters as the defiance of God personal will and civilization versus the natural elements the line between obsession and madness revenge the existential meaning of the sea and so many other matters (not to mention its rich cast of characters and status as the most complete account of the mechanics of whaling ever written for mass consumption). By comparison In the Heart of the Sea comes off more like a long anecdote. The actors are attractive but mostly one-note Hemsworth is the brawny mate with whom youd confidently entrust your life Walker (who here bears an uncanny resemblance to a younger Colin Firth) a boy uninspiringly trying to fill a mans shoes Cillian Murphy the ever-reliable second mate and Holland the game youngster destined to send the story down through the ages. Whishaws Melville comes off as quite pushy and hard-edged in his insistence that grumpy old Nickerson open up to him; charm seems absent from his arsenal of personal attributes. Theres a lot of CGI here but the muted color schemes and crafty professionalism all around make the assorted elements mesh well enough.

December 2 2015 | 0200PM PT A pedestrian retelling of a harrowing real-life survival story that served as one of the key inspirations for ""Moby-Dick."" Call me indifferent. As choppy though not nearly as deep as the waters in which its characters find themselves stranded ""In the Heart of the Sea"" is a pedestrian retelling of a harrowing real-life survival story that served as one of the key inspirations for ""Moby-Dick."" Even stripped of the unhelpful comparisons to Herman Melvilles masterwork however this account of the sad fate of the Essex -- a Nantucket ship that was destroyed by an enormous sperm whale in 1820 and whose crew members were lost at sea for months -- generates altogether less suspense terror and awe than ""Jaws"" managed with a single Robert Shaw monologue. Woodenly adapted from Nathaniel Philbricks superior nonfiction account and directed in alternately stolid and frenetic fashion by Ron Howard the Warner Bros. release could take advantage of its 3D showings and lack of strong early-December competition to spear a decent opening on Dec. 11 before succumbing the following week to the B.O. white whale known as ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" ""How does a man come to know the unknowable?"" a man intones solemnly over the opening shots of the watery deep. Well if youre Herman Melville (played here by Ben Whishaw) you turn up on the doorstep of a hard-drinking former seaman named Tom Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) slam down a wad of cash and insist that he cough up every last detail of the most traumatic ordeal hes ever experienced. Cue extended flashbacks to 30 years earlier in 1820 when the young Nickerson (played by Tom Holland ""The Impossible"") had the misfortune of being one of 21 young whalers on board the Essex sent out from Nantucket on a two-and-half-year voyage around the coast of South America to bring back barrels of whale oil -- the precious resource that all but kept the world running in an era before drilling and fracking. As a young cabin boy still acquiring his sea legs Tom bears witness to the tensions between the ships untested 29-year-old captain George Pollard Jr. (Benjamin Walker) and his brash and confident first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth). As presented in the script by Charles Leavitt (""Blood Diamond"" ""Seventh Son"") the two men are ideally positioned to rub each other the wrong way Pollard unlike Chase hails from a well-established seafaring family but Chase is the more knowledgeable and experienced seaman by far and resents having been passed over for a promotion. Its a difficult relationship mediated to some degree by their even-tempered second mate Matthew Joy (Cillian Murphy) and greatly watered down so to speak from the more complex dynamic described by Philbrick. And it effectively allows the film to blame Pollards insecurities for some of his more reckless decisions -- like steering the Essex into the path of a storm that causes significant damage making it all the more crucial that they return to Nantucket with as much oil as they can carry. Having captured the world of Formula One racing with such a potent sense of stylistic adrenaline in ""Rush"" Howard tries in vain to do something similar for his maritime milieu here even retaining the same excellent d.p. Anthony Dod Mantle and the crack editing team of Mike Hill and Dan Hanley. The director sends the camera flailing in all directions over the deck of the Essex (or a full-size replica of it anyway) aiming to sweep us up in the barely controlled chaos that ensues as all on board try to keep their vessel on course. And there is a certain fascination in the scenes of Chase and his men attacking their majestic largely defenseless prey with harpoons even if the brutality of the whole process feels largely sanitized for PG-13 purposes notwithstanding the sight of blood spurting from one whales blowhole. (The young Nickerson is forced to climb into that snotty orifice to scoop out the last few buckets of oil in a scene that makes you grateful Smell-O-Vision is a thing of the past.) Disaster strikes when the Essex sails into remote waters several thousand miles off the coast of South America where hundreds of whales have retreated after having been hunted to near-extinction closer to land. Its here that the men make contact with a behemoth nearly as long as the 88-foot Essex itself its scarred white-and-gray-flecked body rendered with impressive CGI verisimilitude. The crew have never before encountered a whale of this size let alone a whale that has managed to destroy and capsize a man-made vessel as Proto-Moby manages with a casual flick of its massive tail. Those who survive the fiery wreck manage to climb aboard two whaleboats at which point ""In the Heart of the Sea"" becomes a sort of retread of the survival-at-sea horrors of last years ""Unbroken"" with some compulsory cannibalism thrown in. ""No right-minded sailor discards what might yet save him"" Chase grimly notes after the first seaman dies. Apart from one brief stretch on an unoccupied island that will surely spell the mens doom if they remain too long the two boats remain adrift for months and the sense of a movie lost in its own creative doldrums is palpable. Theres nothing cathartic or even particularly stirring about the sight of these whalers slowly wasting away despite the strenuous plucking of every heartstring by Roque Banos score the actors persuasive display of weight loss the excellent scorched-skin makeup effects and the anguished cutaways to the older Nickerson still crazed with guilt over what he had to do to survive. Whishaws Melville looks on with strained pity in these scenes and you can just about see the gears in his head spinning away as he tries to figure out how to turn this by-the-numbers jumble of set pieces into the Great American Novel. It took Melvilles vision to shape the story of the Essex (among other influences) into an epic meditation on mans capacity for obsession. Howards movie is under no such obligation; a crackerjack thriller a devastating story of loss or an atmospheric dispatch from the bygone days of 19th-century seafaring would have more than sufficed. (The final scenes back on dry land do suggest a widely applicable metaphor for the lengths to which unscrupulous deep-pocketed men will go for oil.) Yet for all the care and expense that has gone into its production (including shooting off the coast of La Gomera one of the Canary Islands) ""In the Heart of the Sea"" feels stiff and unconvincing weirdly devoid of texture and populated by ciphers who speak primarily in the leaden language of exposition. The actors suffer serviceably enough. Holland barfs Murphy bleeds and Frank Dillane waves around a pistol as Pollards fiery younger cousin whose own grisly death gets tweaked here for dramatic effect. And while it may be rooted in reality the Pollard-Chase interplay feels like a poor mans version of the infinitely juicier rivalry in ""Rush"" not aided by the fact that Hemsworth is effectively reprising his role in that film here.

Hiemstra says January 6 2016 at 708 pm If you did not like this movie by any means giving it a 4 could hardly be taken serious by anyone. This is not a 4 I did not like it that much myself but it was still a 7. Your rating isnt right Reply Roseann Marsett says December 29 2015 at 344 pm This review is so off its difficult to believe we went to see the same movie. I think this reviewer has lost (or never developed) the appreciation for a good story well acted. Im glad I ignored his review and went anyway. The movie was great. Reply Neal Benge says December 16 2015 at 343 pm Almost didnt go to see this excellent movie because of poor reviews like this one. Great photography believable special effects solid acting and a good evenly paced story line. Also lots of again believable action. Had a profound ethical message about what it takes to survive when thrown against the prospect of living or dying. And it also had a very realistic presentation of what happens between two men that come from opposite walks in life when forced to depend on one another in order to survive. Loved it best movie weve seen in several years. Reply Cecil B Devine says December 6 2015 at 1001 am Never a big fan of Ron Howards films I thought Id see this based solely on the strength of ""Rush"" which was a very good film indeed. I knew the story well and he did it justice. Unfortunately I know this story too and great struggles that try mens souls is not exactly Opies forte. Reply eddie willers says December 3 2015 at 433 pm ""the precious resource that all but kept the world running in an era before drilling and fracking."" I love that John D. Rockefeller did more to save the whales than all the Greenpeace type do-gooders put together. Reply Bill B. says December 3 2015 at 1103 am If this review is typical of others that is very sad. The previews looked rather promising. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says December 3 2015 at 955 am Perfect Storm. ..with a whale.

Why film the truth to paraphrase ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" when you can film the legend instead? Thats a question that director Ron Howard and screenwriter Charles Leavitt (""Seventh Son"") never quite answer in this sweeping film although they have managed to make the whales the most compelling characters in this account (based on Nathaniel Philbricks award-winning book) of the sad fate of the whaling ship Essex in the early 19th century. See Video Chris Hemsworth Faces a Furious Sperm Whale in New In the Heart of the Sea Trailer Like the recent ""The Walk"" ""Heart of the Sea"" excels at its digital fakery - in this case making enormous sperm whales seem real and deadly as they interact with men who go after them armed only with harpoons ropes and life rafts. As with the Zemeckis film however the computer-generated images are too little too late since the writing has failed to bring us into this world and to care about the people who are risking their lives. Melville (played by Ben Whishaw) brackets the film; a young writer with a few novels under his belt he travels to Nantucket to meet Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson) an older man who as a child crewed on the Essex and is now years later the last survivor of the doomed voyage. Nickerson has no desire to dredge up the ghosts of the past but with Melville offering him all his savings -- and Nickersons wife (Michelle Fairley ""Game of Thrones"") understanding that her husband needs both the money and the emotional release of telling someone his story -- the old salt finally consents. Also Read Chris Hemsworth Shares Shocking Photo of Extreme Weight Loss for In The Heart of the Sea As a ten-year-old orphan young Thomas (Tom Holland ""The Impossible"") was a greenhorn when he boarded the Essex under the command of first mate Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth). Chase thought hed finally have a chance to be captain but the merchants funding the voyage instead placed first-timer George Pollard (Benjamin Walker ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"") at the helm because of his familys social status in Nantucket. The two officers personal friction notwithstanding the expedition seems to be going well when we see the crew capture their first whale but during a stopover in South America the men meet a Spanish captain (Jordi Molla ""Riddick"") who tells of an alabaster-white leviathan that decimated his crew and took one of the captains arms for good measure. Needing more blubber to fill their ship Pollard and his crew give chase with horrifyingly tragic results. Leavitts screenplay is a frustrating one filled with good ideas and terrible ones. In the plus column there are the scenes that break down the process by which whales are captured and then stripped for parts at sea plus the fact that these whalers never explain to each other terminology theyd already know. If that means the audience has to use context to figure out the names of certain sails or knots so be it. Also Read In the Heart of the Sea Actor Edward Ashley Joins Charlie Hunnam in Lost City of Z (Exclusive) What undoes the better writing is the lack of interesting characters; these real-life figures are reduced to types (the working-class guy whos the best at what he does the snob with a title he hasnt earned the plucky kid looking to make good etc.) who never engage. For much of ""Heart of the Sea"" the movie makes an implicit and fairly clear connection between the whaling industry of yore and the petroleum industry of now risking the lives of men and disregarding the environment in the pursuit of profit. But Leavitt and Howard cant stop themselves from underlining this idea having a character express amazement at the end of the film that theyre getting oil out of the ground now whaddaya know? Its the same sort of sandwich-board announcement that pops up periodically in Howards movies (""Frost/Nixon"" comes to mind) where the director doesnt trust the person in the back row to get what the storys about. With the exception of Whishaw and Gleeson who spend the film sitting around a table the cast spends more time being physical rather than reciting dialogue and thats good news for Hemsworth whos always an imposing presence but never quite nails the chow-dah New England accent hes going for here. (He comes off better in Howards far superior ""Rush."") See Video Brian Grazer Ron Howard on Making Science Sexy With Breakthrough Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle gets to work in a vast array of lighting choices from the whale-oil lanterns of Nantucket to the merciless sun beating down on the South Pacific sea. He and the effects team make the whaling sequences seamlessly believable and theres a shot of a burning ship sinking at night that recalls the oil paintings of the era. Lovers of spectacle for spectacles sake will come away from the film with many discrete sequences to admire but theres not enough of a human element to bridge them together. In terms of its lasting power ""In the Heart of the Sea"" roars in like a great tide but then just as quickly dissipates. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
