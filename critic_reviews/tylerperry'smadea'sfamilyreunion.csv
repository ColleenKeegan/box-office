TYLER PERRYS MADEAS FAMILY REUNION --  1/2 -- Tyler Perry Rochelle Aytes Blair Underwood; rated PG-13 (vulgarity violence sex drugs); Carmike 12 and Ritz 15 Theaters; Century Theatres 16 (South Salt Lake); Century Theatres 16 (Sandy); Cinemark 24 at Jordan Landing; Megaplex 12 at the Gateway. Tyler Perrys heart is in the right place but he still has a tin ear. The same tonal problems that plagued last years ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" resurface in ""Tyler Perrys Madeas Family Reunion."" Serving this time as director besides having written the script and starring in three roles -- including of course dragging it up as the pistol-packing plus-size Aunt Madea -- Perry has a message of empowerment and self-respect thats not just important for women to hear its essential. He also has a few choice words for the men in the audience Stand by your women and your families. They need you. Unfortunately all that too often gets muddled in his mess of a screenplay. Maybe the material worked better in its original form on stage. But in cinematic form ""Madeas Family Reunion"" like its predecessor jumps jarringly between romance domestic drama and broad physical comedy. At times it feels as if Perry made three separate films dumped them in a blender and hit the puree button. (""Madeas Family Reunion"" which wasnt screened for critics before opening day is the only movie youll see this year that features protracted flatulence jokes a plot twist involving child molestation and a poetry recital by Maya Angelou. Unless all three show up in ""Scary Movie 4"" of course.) Like Kimberly Elise in Perrys first film who went from pampered society wife to mad black woman Rochelle Aytes stars as Lisa the beautiful stylish fiancee of a beautiful stylish Atlanta investment banker. But behind closed doors Blair Underwoods Carlos repeatedly abuses her and Lisas materialistic mother (Lynn Whitfield) only encourages her to withstand the beatings to maintain her comfortable life. Madea finds time to give her and Lisas sister Vanessa (Lisa Arrindell Anderson) no-nonsense advice about their love lives while caring for a wayward foster daughter sparring with her dirty-old-man older brother (Perry again in white hair and overalls) and planning the titular family reunion. All these elements pop up out of nowhere with seemingly no attempt at a smooth transition between them. Madea pummels a boy on the school bus whos been bullying her foster daughter followed by a scene in which Vanessa and her new boyfriend Frankie (Boris Kodjoe) rhapsodize about what a blessing kids are during a play date at the park. Later Vanessa will get onstage at a club during a poetry slam to perform one of her painful original works ""He. Gives. Me. Courage. To love."" Its one of many scenes that feel corny through the smothering use of romantic Ramp;B music. There is one great moment at the family reunion though in which Aunt Myrtle (Cicely Tyson) lovingly scolds everyone in attendance for not behaving like better people for not taking responsibility for themselves and not loving each other steadfastly enough. Its a rare moment of truth in a movie that too often feels either melodramatic or self-consciously madcap. ""Tyler Perrys Madeas Family Reunion"" is rated PG-13 for mature thematic material domestic violence sex and drug references. Running time 107 minutes.

(Hes played by Blair Underwood as a nightmare Billy Dee Williams.) You havent seen anything yet though. The key Perry moment arrives when Lisas mother played with sexy resplendent bitchery by Lynn Whitfield tells her to stay with the rich bastard because (Im paraphrasing) there are just some things a black womans gotta do. Lets not sell Tyler Perry short. As the vinegar-witted Madea hes a drag performer of testy charm but in his overlit patchwork way hes also making the most primal womens pictures since Joan Crawford flexed her shoulder pads. Madeas Family Reunion plays Lisas horrific engagement off the romantic awakening of her sister (Lisa Arrindell Anderson) but Perrys women arent just looking for love; theyre snapping psychological chains of poverty and abuse and upwardly mobile hunger. No wonder the audience finds them liberating.

Photo credit Alfeo Dixon Photo Alfeo Dixon Too much family and not enough Madea make for a disappointing Family Reunion 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Tyler Perrys Madeas Family Reunion Comedy-drama. Starring Tyler Perry Blair Underwood Rochelle Aytes and Lisa Arrindell Anderson. Directed by Tyler Perry. (PG-13. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Wearing falsies that sag almost to the waist heavy padding everywhere else and a smartly coiffed white wig Madea is Dame Edna transplanted to the South. Her advice is less refined but just as forthcoming. In ""Madeas Family Reunion"" a disappointing sequel to the far funnier ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" she instructs a distraught niece whose fiance routinely beats her up to throw hot grits all over him followed by a thorough battering with a cast iron pan. Outrageously politically incorrect and larger than life (and incidentally most women) Madea is the captivating creation of playwright Tyler Perry who played her for years on the black theater circuit where hes an icon the equal of Neil Simon. ""Diary"" in which Madea made her first big-screen appearance became a surprise box-office hit warranting her return. The problem with ""Family Reunion"" is that theres not enough of Madea in it. The opening-day audience I saw it with -- there was no press preview usually an indicator that the distributor has little faith in its product -- laughed at the mere sight of her affirming her words to the wise by shouting back ""You tell em girl."" Perry who adapted the script from one of his plays weighs the movie down with far too many characters and plotlines. Not only does this cut time for Madea to make her delicious mischief but its also confusing. You need a family tree like those at the beginning of Russian novels just to figure out how everyone is related to everyone else. There are half sisters Lisa (Rochelle Aytes a pretty newcomer who gets to wear fabulous clothes) and Vanessa (Lisa Arrindell Anderson) whose conniving mother adores Lisa because her father left her a trust fund while despising her other daughter for having a bum for a dad. Lisas rich boyfriend Carlos (Blair Underwood) has given her a heart-shaped diamond as big as the Ritz as well as bruises all over her body. By contrast Vanessas beau is poor but kind a devout Christian who wouldnt dream of taking advantage of her sexually. A wayward teen is thrown into the mix for no apparent reason other than to talk back to Madea who proceeds to straighten the girl out. Madea lives with her sexually obsessed brother Joe -- his flatulence is a not terribly amusing running joke -- whose son Brian (at least I think hes Joes son) is a lawyer retained by Madea whos always in some sort of jam. All three family members are played by Perry a one-man band who wrote the music along with the script and is also the director and producer and therefore entirely responsible for this muddled mess. ""Family Reunion"" doesnt know if it wants to be a comedy or a drama and ends up as mostly a melodrama with scenes that would be embarrassing on a soap opera. At a restaurant with his friends Carlos insists Lisa dance with him only to berate her for her behavior all the while grinning and waving at his tablemates. Underwood laughably overdoes the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde thing. True to the title there really is a reunion attended by a large extended clan. Vanessa and her mother get into a catfight in front of all and have to be pulled apart their nostrils still flaring. Maya Angelou and Cicely Tyson make brief appearances as family elders with wisdom to impart. Dignified and articulate they seem to have wandered into the wrong movie. -- Advisory This film shows domestic violence and mild sexuality.

"Reunion brings together melodrama bawdy comedy - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Reunion brings together melodrama bawdy comedy By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  February 25 2006 Its probably useful to think of Madeas Family Reunion"" as a department store. Theres something for almost anybody. Shopping for a paperback melodrama? Its on the first floor. Looking for a gospel sermon? Try the third. Bawdy physical comedy including fart jokes and assorted sex riffs? The cellar obviously. Some parts of Tyler Perrys new movie are better than others -- and all of it is better than Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" his last one.Perry wrote directed produced and scored Family Reunion"" and plays three characters in the film. But amazingly the movie doesnt reek of vanity. Someone else did a cruddy job directing the previous film which Perry also wrote. So even though Diary"" was a huge surprise hit you get the feeling Perry has taken the reins because presumably he wanted it done right.Family Reunion"" which Lions Gate cravenly refused to screen for critics is a warmer more generous helping of the earnestness Perrys acolytes ate up in Diary."" But this time one mad black woman has become two dissatisfied ones. Vanessa (Rochelle Aytes) is engaged to a man who beats her and after two bad relationships her half-sister Lisa (Lisa Arrindell Anderson) has turned to Christ and celibacy.They look to their brazen aunt Madea played by Perry for guidance. She of course has her own problems. Shes still under house arrest for sundry misdemeanors and as a punishment for removing her anklet a judge (TVs Judge Mablean no less) orders her to take a juvenile delinquent (Keke Palmer) into her large Atlanta house where her crass brother (Perry) Lisa and her two little kids already live.But rather than push for sitcom nonsense Perry spins a mean satisfying soap opera out of his middle-class landscape. Spineless Vanessa tries to sneak out of her abusive relationship while Lisa is almost psychotically afraid to love again even though her new man Frankie (Boris Kodjoe) is an artist and city bus driver and is willing to consummate according to Lisas schedule which could be never.Naturally these women have mom to thank for their screwy lives. Shes a high-class diva played to Faye Dunaway extremes by Lynn Whitfield whose beauty is more youthful than anybody here. Mom is a schemer all right the kind of woman rapped about by too many hip-hoppers. She tells her gun-shy daughter she wishes she never had her and tells her abused daughter that she has to stop doing what youre doing to make him angry."" Because Perry really seems to know his stories mom is also in cahoots with Vanessas abuser played by Blair Underwood. Underwood really needs to reconsider his rebirth as the heavy in black movies. Hes a leading man. In any case he and Whitfield do some wonderfully sleazy acting together.Perry is a playwright and his dialogue here is usually entertaining. When Underwood and Whitfield square off he tells her Your horns are showing."" She says Oh well are you upset cause mine are bigger?"" This kind of stuff wins daytime Emmys.But Perry is out for more than melodrama. Hes taken it upon himself to uplift the race with a righteous homily eloquently delivered by Cicely Tyson. The movies sermonizing has the curious effect of making the flatulence gags look embarrassing and the juicy parts seem cheap. But the wakeup call works anyway. When during the big family reunion Tyson demands the black youth of America have some dignity and pull up their jeans and cover their midriffs I did cinch the waist of my pants on the way out of the theater.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Madeas Family Reunion | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Madeas Family Reunion Joe Leydon Film Critic joeleydon 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr February 24 2006 | 0451PM PT Sticking to the successful formula that fueled his ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" multihyphenate Tyler Perry offers another blithely unbalanced mix of low comedy sudsy sentiment and spiritual uplift in ""Madeas Family Reunion."" Ticketbuyers pleased by its predecessor likely will queue up for second helpings. Sticking to the successful formula that fueled his ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" the 2005 sleeper hit that generated torrid biz in theatrical and homevid venues multihyphenate Tyler Perry offers another blithely unbalanced mix of low comedy sudsy sentiment and spiritual uplift in ""Madeas Family Reunion."" And while new pic leans more heavily toward speechifying and soap operatics ticketbuyers pleased by its predecessor likely will queue up for second helpings. Vid sales should be snappy even though Perrys crudely effective crowd-pleaser probably is best enjoyed in urban theaters filled with folks who arent shy about offering running commentary about on-screen activities. Much like ""Diary"" ""Family Reunion"" is based on one of the phenomenally popular stage plays that Perry has performed for predominantly black auds in touring and regional productions. Also like ""Diary"" new pic hard-sells the sassy brassy bluster of the mammoth Madea a trash-talking matriarch played in outrageous drag by Perry himself. When she isnt offering inspirational bromides to loved ones (""Its not where youve been its where youre going"") or taking a tough-love approach to corporal punishment while raising a troublesome foster child (Keke Palmer) Madea takes verbal potshots at annoying relatives or simply glowers at the lesser mortals in her orbit. The literally larger-than-life character gets a bit less screentime in ""Family Reunion"" so that Perry (who also serves as director) can concentrate on scripts more serious elements. But that may have been a mistake The heavily melodramatic tone that predominates throughout much of the pic could have used more leavening with comic relief. Most of ""Family Reunion"" is devoted to upheavals endured by Madeas nieces Lisa (Rochelle Aytes) whose glam mother (Lynn Whitfield) is pushing her into marriage with a wealthy but abusive financial consultant (Blair Underwood); and Vanessa (Lisa Arrindell Anderson) Lisas half-sister a single mother who cant believe (or easily accept) her good fortune when she finally meets her sensitively hunky Mr. Right (Boris Kodjoe). Pic proceeds at a herky-jerky stop-and-start pace as scenario lurches from one dramatic crescendo to the next interrupted only by episodes of Perrys broadly played comic riffing. That this ungainly and inelegant hodgepodge of tears and guffaws has any genuine emotional impact is a tribute to the compelling performances of Aytes and Anderson. Cicely Tyson drops by during the titular family reunion -- which surprisingly doesnt take up much of the pic -- to chide the guests for behavior unbecoming proud African-Americans. When she warns the women not to rely on their sexiness however her words ring hollow coming so soon after Perry springs a sight gag involving a shapely woman in very tight shorts. Making his debut as a feature helmer Perry evidences an uncertain grasp for the mechanics of moviemaking. (For example he has yet to fully master the concept of matching shots.) Even so judging from the aud response during an opening day screening he evidently knows how to score with his target demographic. Compared to the visually drab ""Diary"" new pic comes off as an appreciably more impressive tech package. Trick photography occasionally impresses as Perry once again shares scenes with himself as Joe Madeas chronically cantankerous (and shamelessly horny) brother and/or Brian her straight-arrow nephew. Soundtrack is peppered with aptly chosen pop classics ranging from Bill Withers ""Grandmas Hands"" to -- of course -- Sister Sledges ""We Are Family.""
