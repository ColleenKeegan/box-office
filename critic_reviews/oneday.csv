Could Anne Hathaway pull off the character of a Northern lass (We spent all our summers in a caravan in Whitby) first as an Edinburgh student and later a graduate working in a Taco joint? Would Danish director Lone Scherfig be sensitive to the books subtle but playful period stylings? Would the films makers resist the temptation to tip what was already a slightly gimmicky and cloying story into the territory of full-on romantic sap? And how could one film do justice to 23 eventful years in the lives of confident public-school boy Dexter (Jim Sturgess) and earthy less assured Emma (Hathaway) - two opposites whom the novel visits once a year on the same date they first have a romantic encounter in 1988 as students?The result is a compromise - but not a disastrous one. Nicholls script follows his novel closely as a greatest hits spin on the book rather than taking it anywhere new. Dexter follows a path of success hubris and self-destruction followed by rehabilitation while Emma takes equally as long to discover what she wants from life and a friendship with Dexter but without the accompanying obnoxiousness.Inevitably the story feels filleted although thankfully it gains substance later on. There are strong comic turns from Rafe Spall as Emmas boyfriend and Romola Garai as Dexters joyless wife while Scherfig avoids laying on the period tics too thickly even if she doesnt display huge insight into these years. Troublingly Hathaways accent is too wayward to convince but theres a lightness to her acting that helps paper over the cracks. Sturgess performance emerges as more layered perhaps because the book too was always less about the two of them and more about the world waiting for Dexter to grow up.Visually the film is warm and uncomplicated and deals in easy extremes shabby flats look like Victorian London upscale ones like hotels and no trip to Paris is complete without shots of the Seine and cute cafes. The film might make the book look less astute and interesting than it is but it still has an undeniable emotional wallop by its close.

I have not read the book so cant comment on how similar it is too the film but it is not a hard film to follow and enjoyed in its own right. I thought the acting was great from both the leads (although Anne should have stuck to doing a southern English accent rather than adding random northern bits rather inconsistently). Its a fairly slow paced film but it didnt drag. I enjoyed watching the characters develop and warmed to both of them; Emma got on with life despite being disappointed in love and I felt sympathy for Dexter who found himself living the high life but was quite screwed up.

Ive not read the book but its clear that the transition to film has not been totally successful That said its still an interesting effort . . . .Dont believe what other critics say about Anne Hathaway .. . shes very good in this .. Its typical of the English Critics and the London Eng Lit brigade to try and blame an American for the film which ultimately fails because it cant rid successfully translate a novels structural devices into those appropriate for film. That said . . . my biggest disappointment was the directors decision to go for long-shots when filming Jane Hathaway in the skinny-dipping scene . . . UnforgivableFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 26 2011JoFeaturedIf I hadnt read the book I wouldnt have known what was going on. The characters in the book were likeable but far less so on screen. The story could be used as a lesson in 100 good reasons to forget a one night stand. Em hankered after a pointless individual (Dex) for years and only got him when he was a broken empty shell of a man who had systematically shagged everyone else (including her flat mate) who had had the misfortune to stand in his eye line for more than two minutes. However it was a good lesson in fashion and hairstyles throughout the decades which is illustrated when Em discovers hair straighteners and brushes up towards the end. The film was a verbatim of the book and would have had as much impact if someone had just read it to the audience with a PowerPoint presentation running on the screen. Nonetheless I enjoyed the film and would recommend it to anyone who has read the book.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 24 2011ali catterallFeatured This review may contain spoilers  Yes entirely predictably (well you probably guessed as much from the trailer) they made an utter pigs ear of it. The Good As Dex Jim Sturgess is decent - nails the look and the accent (both of them). Rafe Spall as hapless wannabe comedian Ian is also fine - although there isnt a scintilla of genuine anguish about him when hes dumped but hey its not his story right? (To be honest its a wonder they didnt simply represent him with a balloon on a stick.) It does have a few reflective moments of stillness which are incredibly welcome - mostly concerning Dex and family (if the book was arguably slanted more towards Emmas side of the story here it favours Dex) - but theyre all too rare. The Bad All too rare because this one zips along like its left the iron on (no mean feat in an 108 minute movie) galloping toward the denouement so that any emotional investment we might have made in it is almost completely wiped out. 1997 for example literally lasts a swimming pool length. I know book-to-film adaptations bowdlerise to an extent but this is absolutely ridiculous. Theres also an argument to be made about the wisdom of letting writers adapt their own screenplays. Perhaps some sense of objectivity is lost in the process. Oddly enough a previous David Nicholls TV mini-series called I Saw You starring Fay Ripley is practically a warm-up for One Day and is absolutely wonderful - very worth tracking down. That was in three parts. If the makers of One Day hadnt been so concerned with making a quick buck (usual story) this would have benefited from a mini-series of its own. But then of course theres no money in Telly. At its worst the films truncation manifests in a reliance on phone calls between the pair which makes it seem as if Sturgess is frankly stalking Anne Hathaway. That twist at least is intact and somewhat shocking. But in the same way a sudden glimpse of a mink being flayed alive in the middle of a Disney cartoon might be. Couldnt they have found one single British actress for crying out loud? Yes I know only too well about the need for overseas investment. But youre not looking at Anne Hathaway thinking working-class Northener youre distractedly thinking Isnt that... Anne Hathaway working in a Tex Mex restaurant in Camden? Romola Garai who plays Sophie would have done better - dressed-down a bit. (Or as often suggested Carey Mulligan.) And how do they pull off Hathaway being only subtly attractive? Oversize specs. Because you know specs always make people look dowdy apparently. Im not even going to talk about her accent. Youve heard it. It ranges from Angelas Ashes to... well to Hathaways own American accent in fact. The Ugly The more I think about this the crosser I get. Film Emma never has any tawdry affairs as in the novel as it wouldnt suit her martyred character - and it wouldnt suit the fragrant Hathaway. A layered interesting character becomes a 2-dimensional pouter; pure and nun-like. Just waiting around for Dexter to be ready waiting for him to finally come around and save her tormented soul. Its repulsive actually - and totally a betrayal of her character and the spirit of the original. In short its not the very worst film in the world - its just completely and utterly unremarkable; Sub-Richard Curtis which is something this lovely and moving book just isnt.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 24 2011john o sullivanFeaturedLIKED NOT LOVED THE BOOK CHAPTER 18 GOT ME THOUGH. Agree with antonia Hathaway does good work here and the rest of the cast are excellent Scherig and Nicholls capture all the big parts of the book and i gasped louder than any one in a full cinema at c18 Would recommend to fans of the book and anyone wanting some light comedy that didnt involve human waste eg EBTrsFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 24 2011antoniaFeaturedI think this reveiw describes the pluses and minuses of the film well. I was impressed by the Dexter character as the film develops. It is not as good as the book nor does it have the change of emphasis of the period down. however it is enjoyable and if one forgets about the original and is not worried about the accent of Anne Hathaway worth seeing.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89617/one-day.html,200,oneday0,oneday,timeout

Sometimes July 15 is eventful fraught with drama that affects their future; sometimes its an ordinary slice-of-life sort of day where nothing happens but hey it was good to check in. As gimmicks go -- Im sorry as narrative devices go -- this one isnt bad and it probably plays even better in the novel (written by David Nicholls who also adapted the screenplay). It breaks up what would otherwise be an ordinary ""two peoples relationship over the course of a couple decades"" story. Even with that hook though there isnt much to it. We have two people one very nice and noble the other very flawed and in need of reform and they impact each others lives for a while. The end. Its what a Nicholas Sparks movie would be if it were aimed at grown women rather than teenage girls. Its July 15 1988 when Emma (Anne Hathaway) a bookish Scottish girl who dreams of being a writer meets Dexter (Jim Sturgess) a spoiled upper-class English brat. Theyve just graduated from the same college and might have even crossed paths at some point -- who can say for sure? Emma is mousy and Dexter drinks a lot so theres probably a lot they both miss. In any event they spend the evening together and become friends (maybe slightly more) and a bond is formed. Emma moves to London the following year into an apartment that smells like ""onions and disappointment"" to seek her fortune as a writer. In the meantime she takes a job at a Mexican restaurant where her goony but well-meaning co-worker Ian (Rafe Spall) a would-be comedian takes a shine to her. Meanwhile Dexter finds success in the TV business hosting a shallow late-night youth program and becoming a hard-partying hedonist. There are several charming vignettes from Emma and Dexs on-again/off-again relationship with Hathaway and Sturgess giving consistently engaging performances. Sturgess is sympathetic even when Dexs behavior is shoddy and Hathaway is luminous as always. Danish director Lone Scherfig following up her much more sophisticated coming-of-age comedy An Education clearly loves both characters and wants us to feel likewise. In a movie that had a better story to tell and a deeper point to make the combination of these actors and this director might be extraordinary. Instead its quite ordinary indeed -- an emotional workout a couple instances of outright manipulation and little payoff.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 19 2011 900AM EDT Last updated Thursday Apr. 25 2013 1249PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English The day in One Day is July 15th - thats when Emma and Dexter on their college graduation back in 1988 tumble into bed together but venture no further than awkward groping and the tentative pledge that ""Maybe we should just be friends."" From there the date doubles as a premise For the next 20 years always on that same St. Swithins Day the narrative peeks in on the twosome examining the state of that pledge along with their evolving lives. The result is a romcom with ambition keen to actually develop the characters and to mix a few tears with the laughs. Well the effort is admirable the movie not so much and yet contrary to most pictures it does improve towards the end. At least a little. Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess in a scene from One Day. YouTube.com Multimedia One Day the official trailer The source material is screenwriter David Nicholls popular novel although anyone who remembers Same Time Next Year will know that the basic conceit this rite of annual return has been tested before. Here the couple-in-progress are Brits played by Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway who begin as a study in contrasts. Dexter is rich Emma isnt. Hes an easy-going fun-loving babe magnet - no stretch for Sturgess there. Shes a bit mousey up tight lacking in self-esteem but flashing the caustic wit of the working-class heroine - thats a considerable stretch for Hathaway who in hopes of de-prettifying for the occasion sports a pair of spectacles and a North England accent. The former stays put; the latter alas is all hither and gone.In her most celebrated film An Education director Lone Scherfig steered admirably clear of cliche and conventional wisdom. Not so in these early frames where her stars settle into that most tedious of romantic grooves - yep the duo who are the last to figure out that theyre meant for each other. So the first act up until 1992 sees the guy playboying around London while the gal is engaged in the discouraging business of eliminating the literary half of the writer-waitress profession. But their friendship survives and on one of the July 15th stopovers they even take a holiday together skinny-dipping platonically as Dexter buoys her ever-flagging confidence with a favourite mantra ""Youre attractive youre sexy youre the smartest woman I know."" Nevertheless for reasons best known to them our should-be-lovers still dont get it on.Act two ushers in the attempt at character development - or in this case character assassination. Now the host of a TV variety show as widely watched as it is monumentally dumb Dexter has gotten famous. Hes also acquired a nasty drug habit a nature that vacillates between arrogance and insecurity an iffy marriage with an adulterous wife and a warning from his cancer-stricken mom - ""Youre not very nice any more."" Emmas acquisitions are more mundane a teachers certificate and a live-in affair with one of those nice-but-deadly-boring boyfriends. Ostensibly as the millennium dawns both are getting older too yet not so anyone would notice - seems that time has altered nothing but their hair-styles.The final act opens in Paris 2003 where Emma - minus the specs now with the ugly duckling in full swan mode - is working on a book. Since Dexter is working off a divorce that paves the way for the Big Kiss by the Seine which is where your average rom-com would screech to its happily-ever-after stop. Instead embarking on its own self-improvement program One Day pushes along several more years inviting us en route to shed some real tears. The sentimental-minded will likely comply welling up through the last frames and wishing that the road to the end didnt slog through the beginning and middle.Yes most movies lose momentum and this one gathers it but 20 July days spread over 20 consecutive summers is a long time to wait. So Ill leave you to choose. Either embrace the cliche - better late than never; or stand that cliche right on its head - better never than this late.One DayDirected by Lone ScherfigWritten by David NichollsStarring Anne Hathaway and Jim SturgessClassification PG Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments Print /License AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

"One Day review Romance checks in on couple at one-year intervals |       NJ.com comments One Day review Romance checks in on couple at one-year intervals Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 19 2011 at 731 AM View/Post Comments Giles Keyte/Focus FeaturesAnne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess in the romance ""One Day."" This is what you can do in the space of 24 hours. See the sun come up and go down and then come up again. Watch a 48-episode marathon of ""The Twilight Zone"" complete with commercials or a whole DVD season of ""24."" Or maybe change your life. ""One Day"" was the British best-seller that suggested you could do just that -- with the help of one person. It was a fascinating story of the arc of a relationship -- from clumsy one-night stand to friends to ex-friends to maybe something else. It told that story smartly by having its young couple meet one day in college and then checking in on them on the same date every year to see where they were in their lives and careers. It was like telling a novel through postcards. Or doing a movie in snapshots. Because its a film now directed by Lone Scherfig the Danish filmmaker whose ""Italian for Beginners"" announced a warm new humanist talent in 2000 -- and whose ""An Education"" confirmed that nine years later. And its that rare thing a romance for grown-ups. Anne Hathaway -- in the best bit of American thievery since Renee Zellweger nicked ""Bridget Jones"" -- plays the bright good-girl Emma; Jim Sturgess adding more than a bit of rakish danger to his Paul McCartney eyes is Dexter her rich-boy crush. Both are very real people played with a great deal of charm -- and a rare capacity for change. When we first meet Emma for example shes a sort of 20ish Hermione Granger all frizzy hair and sour jokes -- but once she finds her calling as a writer the confidence comes. Dexter meanwhile is a looker -- but both desperate and indiscriminate in his search for approval. Hes not a bad man but a weak one and he has no sense of himself. They are completely wrong for each other. Which of course also makes them completely right for each other. His impulsiveness breaks her out of her drab severity. Her seriousness pulls him back to earth. They make each other better. Few films ""get"" the strange intertwining bonds of affection quite so effortlessly although the episodic structure keeps the drama from flowing nicely. And the story -- adapted by David Nicholls from his novel -- could certainly use more fleshing out. Neither character for example seems to have any other friends; co-workers and family are mostly a blur. This avoids some cliches (the Sassy Gay Neighbor the Blunt Best Pal) but eliminates emotional context. Even if Emma and Dexter sometimes feel as if theyre the only two people in the world the film shouldnt agree with them. Yet the blinkers the movie wears does tend to concentrate its focus wonderfully. Because unlike its sometimes questing characters this film doesnt get distracted or go off on unpromising detours; it always knows what its about. This girl. This boy. And that one day that changed everything. Ratings note The film contains nudity sexual situations and drug and alcohol abuse. One Day (PG-13) Focus (108 min.) Directed by Lone Scherfig. With Anne Hathaway Jim Sturgess. Now playing in New Jersey.

Starring Anne Hathaway Jim Sturgess Director Lone Scherfig Release Opened Aug 19 2011  Editorial Review Same time next year for love and lossBy Ann HornadayFriday Aug 19 2011Need a good cry? Go see ""Senna"" Have a few tears left? You might want to check out ""One Day"" Lone Scherfigs attractive if tepid tear-jerker about fate friendship love and loss. Oy the loss. Anyone who has read the book will be prepared for the radical turn ""One Day"" takes; those who havent may want to brace themselves. But even before ""One Day"" whops viewers over the head with its third-act stunner its suffused with the theme of loss mostly as it relates to those opportunities we let slip through our otherwise occupied fingers realizing what might have been only when its too late. The star-crossed British couple at the center of this familiar object lesson are Emma and Dexter whose college graduation-night hookup on July 15 1988 ends in a platonic cuddle amid vows always to stay friends. ""One Day"" which screenwriter David Nicholls adapted from his own novel then traces the erstwhile couples friendship in episodic snapshots captured on succeeding July 15ths tracing their lives and careers as the brainy slightly cynical Emma seeks the writers life and Dexter - rich spoiled lazy - becomes a cheesy MTV talk show host. As personified by Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess Emma and Dexter make for a pretty convincing friends-who-should-be-lovers couple a la Harry and Sally et alia - although purists may wonder why Scherfig whose winsome adaptation of ""An Education"" became an art house hit a few years ago - would cast an American actress in a role that demands impeccable British bona fides. (Hathaways accent is not quite locate-able although Liverpool occasionally peeks out.) Sturgess on the other hand proves quite capable of channeling the kind of charming lout that Hugh Grant played in the similarly structured ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" As Dexters sense of entitled aplomb begins to suffer a few dents Sturgess bears the physical and psychic signs with weary bleary authenticity. (Three cheers too for Rafe Spall as Ian one of Emmas suitors and a would-be stand-up comedian. Only someone as skilled as Spall could capture Ians disastrous timing with such impeccable timing.) The conceit of ""One Day"" - that we see the protagonists only one day a year leaving it to them to reveal what has happened the past 12 months - works better on the page than the screen at times especially when a pivotal encounter occurs entirely off stage. But and not surprisingly Nicholls has proven a faithful shepherd to his fictional creations who banter and rant at each other with the practiced elan of the aging couple theyre clearly meant to be. ""One Day"" often seems too tame for its own good as if its spirited protagonists were censoring themselves in deference to a PG-13 rating. But it has fun with the signs and signifiers of its respective eras introducing young viewers to such concepts as the ""electric typewriter"" the ""Sony Walkman"" and a brand-new doohickey called a ""mobile telephone."" After that kidney-punch of an ending - and the ensuing endings that follow - ""One Day"" drives home what these now-ancient artifacts symbolize Things change so fast wed best grab what we love and hold tight as long as we can.Contains sexual content partial nudity profanity and substance abuse.

(Giles Keyte/AP) Joe Neumaier Friday August 19 2011 400 AM Title One Day With Anne Hathaway Jim Sturgess. A couples almost-romance is seen on the same day over 20 years. Director Lone Scherfig (158). PG-13 Sexuality. At area theaters.Fans of the Cinema of Delayed Love -- CDL lets call it -- have only a handful of titles to call their own ""An Affair to Remember"" ""Same Time Next Year"" ""When Harry Met Sally ..."" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""Now CDL aficionados have ""One Day"" though it is a tedious addition to this subspecies of rom-com despite Anne Hathaways efforts to make us fall for her regardless of the setting.Hathaway plays Emma a bookish Brit who in 1988 hides behind big glasses and a frosty demeanor. The day she obtains her university diploma early twentysomething Emma meets fellow grad Dexter (Jim Sturgess) a friend of a friend and a raffish lad likely to confuse empty charm with likability.Emma and Dex wind up in bed though nothing happens and they part as friends. Seems like the start of a fine romance but director Lone Scherfig (""An Education"") then must honor the format in David Nicholls screenplay of his book and show Emma and Dex on the same day July 15 for nearly 20 years.As 1992 rolls around a sense of dread sets in Are they really going to do every single year?They sure do. Though in one brief scene in the mid-90s Emma is simply swimming in a pool. Guess it wasnt a big year.In other segments wanna-be writer Emma pines for Dex Dex exploits his obnoxiousness for fun and profit as host of a late-night talk show Emma takes a waitress gig while Dex takes drugs.Later Dex has an annoying girlfriend who becomes pregnant then becomes his wife while Emmas only significant other is an irritating standup comic (Rafe Spall). Eventually she and Dex sync up though there are sigh complications.This is the kind of movie where you notice Dexter deliberately name-dropping ""Jurassic Park"" instead of the potentially powerful scene going on between him and his terminally ill mom (Patricia Clarkson).Thats partly because the structure ironically gives Sturgess only enough time to do fade-out sketches instead of add emotional layers. The actor is a wispy bloke anyway but could have done more if it didnt seem like he was going off to apply age-makeup every few minutes.As for Hathaway shes also ill-served by the shorthand. Plus as in ""Love and Other Drugs"" the old-fashioned portents of doom dont suit her. Shes best doing contemporary and edgy as in her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Rachel Getting Married.""Up-to-the-minute serves her well. ""One Day"" does not.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

By Giles Keyte Focus Features The film adapted from a best seller checks in with Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) each July 15 since graduation. EnlargeClose By Giles Keyte Focus Features The film adapted from a best seller checks in with Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) each July 15 since graduation. Some are memorable for reasons that become clear in retrospect. Such is the case for Dexter and Emma the central couple in the surprisingly profound One Day. STORY Hathaway turns on British charm David Nicholls wrote the witty prose of the best-selling novel and the deftly constructed screenplay and the central concept so absorbing as a literary device translates surprisingly well to the screen. The story begins on July 15 1988 graduation day for Emma Morley (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgess) Edinburgh college students who skirt a one-night hookup and begin a life-long friendship. As the saga spans 1988 to 2011 the story checks in yearly with the characters on the same calendar day to gauge where their lives have taken them. Often its not very far. The core conceit is employed subtly never resorts to gimmickry and spares audiences thudding swaths of exposition. Amid sharp banter the film poignantly captures how lives meander and take unexpected turns. Intellectual promise doesnt always lead to a brilliant career and jobs that seem glamorous often go nowhere. Emma labors for a couple years as a waitress in London though she has obvious writing talent. Dexter is a TV presenter who affects a party-hearty manner that irritates most of Britain. About the film One Day    1/2 out of four Stars Anne Hathaway Jim Sturgess Rafe Spall Patricia Clarkson Ken Stott Director Lone Scherfig Distributor Focus Features Rating Rating PG-13 for sexual content partial nudity language some violence and substance abuse Running time 1 hour 47 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The inspired casting of Hathaway and Sturgess makes the story all the more emotionally engaging. As the whip-smart drily funny Emma Hathaway is terrific. The actress nails the working-class character down to the idiosyncrasies of her North England accent. Her initial gawky charm is conveyed believably as is her graceful transformation into a successful writer. Hathaways self-deprecating grimace speaks volumes about Emmas shaky confidence. Dexter takes longer to mature and shed his self-absorption. Sturgess conveys the various facets of his character superbly. He goes from casually charming college heartthrob to slick on-camera personality to rudderless wash-up and eventually to loving father. He has a more dramatic arc than Emma but Emma is more consistently sympathetic. Several supporting characters are excellent particularly Rafe Spall as Ian the awkward unfunny stand-up comedian besotted with Emma. Director Lone Scherfig was a wise choice for the material. Her last film 2009s An Education demonstrated her clear-eyed style and ease with complex material. One Day is an aching lovely romance but its also an insightful look at human potential and the search for a purposeful existence. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

A great hue and cry arose across the pond last year when it was announced that American Anne Hathaway had been cast as Em the less-than-glamorous British heroine in the film version of the best-selling novel ""One Day"" -- basically ""When Harry Met Sally"" with a four-handkerchief twist. Dowdy costumes -- and that old Hollywood standby glasses -- may not be able to dim Hathaways star wattage and her wavering accent may not pass muster with picky Brits. But for me Hathaway turns out to be the best thing in director Lone Scherfigs disappointing follow-up to the extravagantly praised ""An Education."" The new films action takes place every July 15 beginning in 1988 and continuing for two decades or so. Working-class Em hooks up with the handsome more affluent Dex (British actor Jim Sturgess of ""Across the Universe"") on the day of their college graduation in Edinburgh. PHOTOS ANNE HATHAWAYS LEADING MEN Theyre not always together on July 15 -- in 1990 hes partying with a naked woman in Paris and Em is underemployed as a manager at a Mexican restaurant in London. She eventually moves in with a smitten colleague a failed comedian (Rafe Spall son of Timothy) she doesnt quite love. Returning to London Dex acquires a measure of stardom -- as well as a taste for cocaine booze and promiscuity -- as the host of a cheesy late-night music program on TV. On one of their several reunions on various July 15s including a skinny-dipping episode he rudely brushes aside her concerns about his hard-partying lifestyle which is taking a toll on his career. Her relationship founders but the comedians parting gift is to encourage her literary ambitions and sure enough her first book is a best seller. By this point the self-pitying Dex -- whos lost his mother (Patricia Clarkson in a small role) to cancer and his TV show -- has hit rock bottom. A short-lived marriage (to Romola Garai) that produces a daughter and an unhappy new career does little to reverse his downward trajectory. At some point in the late 90s Em and Dex decide they were fated for each other after all. Its easy to see how Dex would be attracted to the newly self-confident Em. I had more of a problem understanding why Em would want anything to do with Dex a substance-abusing jerk who is anything but charming. I might be able to get past that if Hathaway and Sturgess had any chemistry. There are no sparks whatsoever and thats always a deal-breaker for me in romantic films. ""An Education"" conveyed a wonderful sense of time and place something thats largely missing here -- if it werent for title cards and the occasional shoulder pad it would be hard to tell whether youre looking at a scene from 1996 or 2006. David Nicholls who adapted his own novel for the screen doesnt work the same alchemy that Nick Hornby created from Lynn Barbers memoir for ""An Education."" Theres far too much on-the-nose dialogue (""She made you decent"") plus Nicholls adds an extremely schmaltzy ending chapter that wasnt in his book. Even with his hair grayed up Sturgess in no way physically conveys the middle-aged man hes become toward the end. Hathaway though suggests Ems life journey beautifully and shes the best reason to see ""One Day"" if you must. Just brace yourself for a digital effect thats as overused in contemporary movies as it is unconvincing. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Ridley Scott to direct a new Blade Runner Read Next Ridley Scott to direct a new Blade Runner Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 43460 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21100 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18381 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(AP Photo/Focus Features Giles Keyte) Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) have the kind of relationship that women and men sometimes find hard to handle Theyre friends not lovers. But the potential for sex is always there from their first meeting in the late 1980s to their periodic reunions over about two decades of British cultural change.Its a classic case of opposites attracting. Emma is studious and somewhat insecure; Dexter is outgoing and overconfident. Emma aspires to be a writer; Dexter is happy to be host of a TV show. Emma is sexier than she thinks she is; Dexter cant live without sex. Theyd make a great couple if only they could get on the same page -- or the same stage.It seems that they both have some growing up to do. But as often happens in such stories tragedy lurks. It also lingers as we dawdle with one of the characters way past what should have been the ending. Based on a book by David Nicholls ""One Day"" fails to make us care about the young couple at its center. Working from a screenplay by Nicholls director Lone Scherfig maintains a lively pace and she elicits spirited performances from Hathaway and Sturgess. The problem is a story that may have worked as a novel but never quite gels as a film. Its a big disappointment coming from Scherfig whose drama ""An Education"" (2009) was a model of concise yet engaging storytelling.""One Day"" also squanders the talents of Hathaway who was terrific in last years ""Love and Other Drugs."" She brings to Emma an appealing vulnerability. As Dexter Sturgess -- who has appeared in films from ""21"" to ""Across the Universe"" -- deftly balances charm and smarm. Perhaps one day Hathaway and Sturgess will reunite in a more emotionally satisfying romance.

"""One Day"" doesnt live up to its promise movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMovie review One DayDespite a talented cast including Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess and a bestselling novel as its source the pieces never come together in this disappointing romantic drama.August 19 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway star as Dexter and Emma in ""One Day."" (Giles Keyte / Focus Features )""One Day"" seemed so promising given its pedigree a lovely and sensitive actors Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess at the forefront; Lone Scherfig a master of intimacy in the directors chair; and David Nicholls adapting his own bestselling romance novel. But as so often happens with love what you hope for is not even close to what you get and in this case we are left with a heartbreaking disappointment of a film. It starts off in Edinburgh Scotland one day in 1988 July 15 to be exact when Emma (Hathaway) and Dexter (Sturgess) meet on graduation day end up in bed yet very much off on the wrong foot. Hes more upper crust really out of her league. Shes frumpy but smart and sardonic enough to keep him intrigued if not attracted. True romance isnt in the cards on that day but we have time. The film as the book did before it covers a 20-year span dropping in on them each year on the same July day. The narrative is driven by modern themes. Em and Dex have varying degrees of success and failure on the personal and career fronts which seem to be the main topic of conversation when they meet up each year usually in and around London where much of the film takes place. She busses tables at a Mexican restaurant and tries to write when shes not at work. Hes a rising reality-TV star on a downward spiral sped along by healthy doses of cocaine and the fickle nature of fame. He has a string of young lovelies while she struggles with relationships. Ian a stand-up comic wannabe turns up as her rock for a while (a smart turn by Rafe Spall). Patricia Clarkson and Ken Stott are mostly underemployed as Dexs parents though there are some nice moments between Stott and Sturgess toward the end. If Dex and Em are in an extended pickle of whether to be or not to be a couple its nothing compared with the problems the actors are facing. In the film there is a lot of tempting and resisting and a few lingering kisses beautifully shot by director of photography Benoit Delhomme but the passion is missing. If anything the awkwardness that rightfully infuses their first encounter never leaves. Its a very British production but the accent never sits well with Hathaway. More problematic she never comes close to the sort of textured portrait she brought to ""Rachel Getting Married."" Sturgess excellent holding together the very loosely constructed ""Across the Universe"" is no better off. As Dex hes to be a lovable rogue but charm fails him here. This sort of story should have been a slam-dunk for Scherfig. The Danish director has been close to a sure thing since U.S. audiences began discovering her in 2002 with her first English-language film ""Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself"" a sweet comedy about suicide and family ties. But it was 2009s Oscar-nominated ""An Education"" that cemented her as a truly significant cinematic voice. In the coming-of-age story that launched Carey Mulligans career Scherfig allowed us to creep inside a life in transition. She made you feel an actual witness to those deliciously dangerous liaisons. In ""One Day"" with the world again turning on the axis of a single relationship the characters and the story slip away from her. Nicholls novel was a sensation in part due to the clever way it revealed Dex and Em a fragments that eventually came together to create a full-bodied exploration of what goes right and wrong with the people we love. This is not the first time hes tackled adapting for the screen. ""Starter for 10"" his earlier go at British class issues school and love in 2006 turned out to be an enjoyable entertainment with James McAvoy its winning lead (though ""The Last King of Scotland"" would be that years game-changer for the actor). But in nipping and tucking Nicholls loses too much of the context necessary if were to fall in love with Dex and Em and the idea that they really should be together. And why do we show up for romantic movies if not to pull for an ever after happily or otherwise? Dialogue that played on page turns tedious on screen and there is an awful lot of it. Back for a moment to Delhomme (""The Scent of Green Papaya"" ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas""). The French cinematographers eye for places and people is so consistently stylish and spot-on that even films that otherwise fall short are worth seeing if he shot them. When the tedium overtakes ""One Day"" pass the time looking at how skillfully he moves in to set the mood and frame the moment. Still its a puzzle why so many talented folks were so far off the mark a hopefully it will only be for ""One Day."" betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review The Painting a broad brushstroke on...May 23 2013Movie review DriveSeptember 16 2011Movie review Fantasy meets reality in Meet Monica VelourApril 8 2011Movie review Love amp; Other DrugsNovember 24 2010Movie review Never Let Me GoSeptember 15 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTFilmRomanceAnne HathawayCarey MulliganCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-one-day-20110819,0,6491602.story?track=rss",200,oneday12,oneday,latimes

Starring Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway. Directed by Lone Scherfig. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""One Day"" is a beautiful movie but beautiful in a way that life often is not movies. Nothing is sudden or easy either for the characters or for the audience and there are no thunderbolts from the blue. Rather the film achieves its effects and builds toward a wealth of feeling through an accumulation of seemingly day-to-day incidents presented over the course of years. We meet two people and with time and maturity the towering consequence of their relationship reveals itself. So this is no light romantic movie. It may wear its seriousness lightly as it should but this is really about two people discovering meaning in their lives - which is next door to saying that ""One Day"" is about the meaning of life in general. Life may be clumsy full of misguided ambitions false directions and inhibiting fears and with long stretches of drudgery interrupted by short bursts of misery. But if people are lucky the movie is saying they eventually figure out what they should be doing and whom they should be doing it with. Or to put it another way there are a million love stories in the Naked City and ""One Day"" is just one of them - but a particularly emblematic one that resonates as a generational story as well. Related Stories As time goes by Review One Day Based on the novel of the same name by the British writer David Nicholls and adapted by the author it introduces us to two people in their early 20s who spend the night together on July 15 1988. Emma (Anne Hathaway) is caustic witty insecure and smart from a working-class background and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) is upper middle class and radiant with a self-confidence not to be confused with self-love. (He likes himself but hes on to himself.) She wants to be a writer and he wants to be famous. And the two connect for no reason but that opposites often do. They become friends. From there on the movie looks in on Emma and Dexter on every subsequent July 15 from 1989 through the present day. This device - one would call it a gimmick were it not so inspired - is not to be confused with anything like ""Same Time Next Year"" in which the characters contrive to meet every anniversary. Rather this is just an arbitrary conceit that proves irresistible a series of snapshot portraits of two often-separate lives from young adulthood to early middle age. Without making a big deal about it the movie charts their career trajectories as well as the year-by-year advances in technology the changing styles the social scene in London and the subtle but very real differences between being say 28 and 32. Much of the films humor derives from Dexters career as a TV presenter a horror in which he interviews rap groups wears ridiculous pants and pretends to be a cockney. But perhaps the most important thing about ""One Day"" is that this is one of the rare romantic films in which we know why the central characters are or should be in love. And for once it has nothing to do with the elusive chemistry of two star personalities. Hathaway doesnt play her bright usual self but a brainy Brit and Sturgess is not well known enough to have an established star persona. Everything here is about the alchemy of the characters which the actors inhabit with knowing good humor. Lone Scherfigs direction is sure and insightful and contains accent notes that release the storys pent-up power. I was going to describe a shot late in the film in which Scherfig includes 1988 and 2011 in the same frame but no Ill let you find it. But certainly in a film so wedded to the calendar its a stroke of brilliance to suggest that nothing goes away and that time as people experience it is a lie. Actually if youre keeping score that is the precise moment that a very satisfying movie is transformed to the level of poetry a level that once achieved ""One Day"" never loses.

She can act too (see Brokeback Mountain) but theres no tamping down the glossy dark beauty that raised her from a gawky teen who morphs into a soignee royal under the tutelage of Julie Andrews in the charming The Princess Diaries or from grad-school preppy duds to designer threads in The Devil Wears Prada the better to take crap from Meryl Streep. When she hid her lustrous tresses under a chopped shag to play an unhappy junkie in Rachel Getting Married the net effect was to bring out her inner gamine. Hathaways old-fashioned reserve her fallback niceness and her retro elegance in a little black dress and upswept chignon bring her as close to Audrey Hepburn as we get these brash bare-it-all days. One Day gets around to the black dress eventually but the movie opens with Hathaway in sensible frocks wire-rimmed spectacles and an intermittent North Country British accent as Emma a sensible proletarian university student so untutored in bedroom etiquette that she puts Joan Armatrading on the turntable for a one-night stand with privileged playboy Dexter a Lothario played rather smugly by Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe). Their tryst turns into an improbably platonic friendship whose progress this tidily structured film revisits annually over 20 years. The anniversary date wont ring a bell with most Americans but in Britain July 15 is St. Swithins Day when life can turn one way or the other depending on the weather. Adapted by David Nicholls from his best-selling novel (wickedly nailed by New York Times book critic Janet Maslin as ""the no-Sweden no-vampire fiction hit of the summer"") One Day is capably if unimaginatively directed by the Danish filmmaker Lone Scherfig (An Education). Scherfig covers the bases of the made-for-export womens picture flattening all specificity of character place and culture into an easy-to-read shorthand for the movie tourist. The wardrobe is strenuously 90s the ambiance travelogue-British -- Westminster Cathedral Big Ben and all that with over-exposed bits of Paris thrown in for added glamour. But the unfolding parable of what really matters in life is strictly old-school pre-bubble American. Armed with made-to-measure jackets and very little effort Dex achieves lightning stardom as the coke-fortified host of an obnoxious TV game show while hard-working Emma charts a slow and steady route through waitressing and school teaching to a bohemian writing life that never dislodges her good sense beyond a brief excursion into skinny-dipping with Dex. Hathaway expertly moves Emma from unfinished rough diamond to the polish of a mature woman and when we finally see her swanning around Paris in that hard-earned little black number its hard to avoid a sharp intake of breath. i The time-lapse storytelling employed by the film allows Emma to mature from faux-Bohemian college student to intellectual expat living and writing in Paris. Giles Keyte/Focus Features hide caption toggle caption Giles Keyte/Focus Features The time-lapse storytelling employed by the film allows Emma to mature from faux-Bohemian college student to intellectual expat living and writing in Paris. Giles Keyte/Focus Features As Emma rises Dex falls so low that even his BFF gets to make the statutory ""I-love-you-but-I-dont like-you"" speech. In its long baggy middle the movie holds out the quotidian pleasure of watching two young people traversing the unevenness of life and making all the usual mistakes with unsuitable partners. There are some lively ancillary performances among them a precise turn from Patricia Clarkson as Dexs mother who enjoys his wild-boy antics while making it clear that he has yet to discover his best self; and an all too brief appearance as Dexs wife from the talented Romola Garai (Atonement). Yet One Day ends up fatally compromised by its glib recourse to death and cancer as moral wake-up calls. Toward the end the action takes a left turn into cheap and nasty sensation -- a panicked awakening perhaps to the need for plot or Nicholls need to play God with his characters and his audience. A stitched-on coda supplies missing information about Dex and Emmas first day together thats meant to convince us this match was made in heaven. One Day persists in asking when this clueless pair will wake up to the truth that they are meant to be but it had me wondering why on earth someone like Emma would give a featherweight brat like Dex the time of day. The short answer is that no popular storyteller ever went broke stoking the undying female fantasy that if a good woman puts her mind to it a heel can always be brought to heel.

Courtesy Focus Features. By Joe Morgenstern August 19 2011 The gimmick in ""One Day"" (its never anything more than a gimmick) is a dramatic structure (though theres very little drama) that follows the evolution of an English friendship by revisiting the two friends (Anne Hathaways Emma and Jim Sturgesss Dexter) on every July 15 (their college graduation day and their first day together) for two decades. And speaking of gimmicks did the stops and starts of that previous sentence annoy you? Did the parentheticals put you off? Theyre only a pale imitation of how annoying the herky-jerky rhythm of the movie gets to be. By the fourth or fifth July 15 you may start to feel like Bill Murrays character trapped in ""Groundhog Day."" In that comic masterpiece the less things change the funnier they are. In this frustrating fizzle the friendship does keep struggling to change into a love affair. But year after year July 15 after July 15 its the same old same old--two increasingly tedious people talking self-conscious talk. ENLARGE Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway enjoy one of the many July 15s in One Day. Focus Features ""One Day"" was directed by Lone Scherfig from David Nichollss adaptation of his best-selling novel which used the same structure--each chapter set on a successive July 15. Ms. Scherfig is a superb filmmaker; her last film intelligent and uncommonly entertaining was ""An Education."" Ms. Hathaway is a gifted actress who set the screen on fire in ""Rachel Getting Married"" and distinguished herself in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Brokeback Mountain."" Mr. Sturgess was at the very least an appealing presence as Jude in Julie Taymors endearing Beatles extravaganza ""Across the Universe."" Why then has a bad thing happened to these good people? Because the movies content and style generate all the synergy of fingernails and blackboard. Emma is bright and pretty behind her wire-rim specs but her lack of self-confidence grows wearisome. Dexters genuine charm soon sours with drugs and booze. No wonder this spoiled young man turns into a sleazy TV host whos described by a London tabloid as ""the most annoying man on the telly."" (His runner-up in the annoyance derby is Rafe Spalls Ian a grimly unfunny standup comic.) What with Emma slogging through demeaning jobs (we see a lot of a tacky Tex-Mex restaurant in London where shes a waitress) and Dexters compulsive womanizing (""Its like I just got out of prison all the time"") the film finds the two would-be soul mates wrestling with the same issues every year it looks in on them. And when something decisive finally happens in their lives its perfectly calculated to destroy whatever pleasure we might have been hoping for thematic resemblances to ""Love Story"" notwithstanding. The result is a sort of selective time-lapse photography in which exterior changes--telephones go mobile a laptop replaces Emmas Olivetti portable typewriter--outpace emotional development. The structural gimmick worked for the novel because each chapter offered a density of detail that the movies segments cant match. Anyone who loves to read knows that reading is an active pursuit active and immersive while movie-going is passive unless the movie has the power to pull us in. The pull doesnt come from sampling arbitrary slices of time; thats why such contrivances as ""Two for the Road"" and ""Same Time Next Year"" have remained curiosities. Since we live our own lives in the urgency and intensity of the moment were pulled into the lives of others by watching them make the moment-to-moment and second-to-second choices that determine their fate. ""One Day"" gives us something different and off-putting a long succession of scenes mostly chaste and insistently verbose that represent whole years. Occasional coitus constant interruptus. Mozarts Sister See a clip from the film ""Mozarts Sisters."" Video courtesy of Music Box Films. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart--that is to say a self-contained but slightly smug little kid called Wolfie--plays second fiddle to his older sister in Rene Ferets beguiling celebration in French with English subtitles of the familys other prodigy. Maria Anna nicknamed Nannerl was in fact a gifted composer singer and harpsichordist. Until Wolfie started crowding her style she was often the headline attraction in the Mozart musical circus that traveled around Europe under Papa Leopolds direction. (Hes played by Marc Barbe.) But the facts of her life arent the attraction here. A work of fiction Mr. Ferets film is ardent in its inventions modest in scale playful in its speculations about Nannerls influence on her brothers music and graced by the filmmakers daughter Marie Feret in the title role. Ms. Feret gives a fine performance delicate and precise as Nannerl at the end of adolescence when shes becoming a young woman and discovering gifts that have nothing to do with notes on a staff. Through a series of encounters that briefly threaten to turn her into another Yentl passing herself off as a boy Nannerl meets the Dauphin (Clovis Fouin) a mysteriously melancholy young man who falls in love with her for the right reasons in the right order the quality of her music the purity of her soul and the fact that shes a great looker. Their encounters are at once implausible--flagrantly so when it comes to his climactic gesture--and passionate. Terrified of falling into the dissolute ways of his father Louis XV the Dauphin is the one man in Nannerls life who can see her as a full human being. ENLARGE Clovis Fouin as the Dauphin and Marie Feret as the title character in Mozarts Sister. Films Alyne That cant be said of her father. When she asks him to teach her composition as he does Wolfie--""I hear notes my own notes in my head but I dont know how to write them down""--he informs her that the secrets of harmony are beyond most people especially women. ""Mozarts Sister"" in limited release this week is a feminist statement--thats implicit in its title--but its also an intriguing story of a girl coming of age in a singular family. Leopold may see her musical gifts as a disease she needs to be cured of but hes a loving father all the same. (One powerful scene finds him playing the violin to help cure her of a physical disease that threatens to kill her.) Wolfie may be an impossible pain--""They say youre a genius"" Nannerl cries ""but youre an idiot""--yet hes her only brother and she loves him. (In one charming scene brother and sister wake up in the morning and sing a little duet instead of speaking.) The movie itself is self-contained in an interesting way that addresses an aesthetic problem How do you draw contemporary audiences into a rather intellectual period piece with music? (The lovely original music was composed by Marie-Jeanne Serrero.) Mr. Ferets strategy involves rigorous restraint. His film is understated even underlit. Instead of presenting us with forceful performances he seduces us with subtle ones and allows us the sensation of discovery. These days thats a special pleasure.  A correction I was mistaken when I wrote in last weeks column that ""The Help"" was Tate Taylors directorial debut. Mr. Taylors first feature film ""Pretty Ugly People"" was released in 2008. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Italian for Beginners (2000) Lone Scherfig wrote and directed this Danish comedy about six men and women looking for love--and learning Italian--in the dead of Copenhagens winter. I recommended it last year but Im mentioning it again as an example of what an exceptional filmmaker can do with the right material (as opposed to the script inflicted on her by ""One Day""). Far from flawless this low-budget film is memorable for its agility and disarming intensity. It leaps from one small revelation to the next never dwelling on significance never exploiting emotion or inflating honest sentiment to sentimentality. Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself (2002) Ms. Scherfigs first English-language feature is full of life--which is a very good thing to say about a story that turns on death--wonderfully odd and a gallery of perfect performances. The setting is contemporary Glasgow which means the Scottish accents can be confounding; at times I would have welcomed subtitles. Wilbur who is played by Jamie Sives has tried to kill himself so many times that he gets kicked out of his suicide support group. Adrian Rawlins is Harbour Wilburs sweet-spirited brother and Shirley Henderson is Alice the woman they both fall for. Elvira Madigan (1967) Long before ""Amadeus"" Bo Widerbergs Swedish-language tale of doomed love put Mozart on the pop charts with its hypnotic use of the Piano Concerto No. 21. The lovers are Pia Degermarks exquisite tightrope walker Elvira and Thommy Berggrens married officer Lt. Sixten Sparre. In my Newsweek review I called it the most beautiful film ever made then spent decades regretting my gushiness. Now as I write this Im watching it once again--via Netflix on my iPad--and Im not so sure I was wrong. Jorgen Persson did the sublime cinematography which has somehow survived the ravages of time.

Anne Hathaway all flyaway hair and puppy-pouty is Em and Jim Sturgess cocksure and bedroom-eyed Dex in Lone Scherfigs wan adaptation of David Nicholls colorful novel. Notwithstanding the considerable attractions of its stars the characters never entirely emerge in this film from Scherfig the maker of Italian for Beginners and An Education. Between the self-conscious performances of the leads and the films amused nostalgia for two decades of unfortunate style choices Dex and Em become reduced to stereotypes of posh heartbreaker and lovelorn scrapper. Although Nicholls adapted his own novel for the screen lost in his translation is the adroitness with which his characters skate from inner thought to outer expression. What they say not what they feel is paramount for Scherfig whose film emphasizes their glib patter and not the inner anxiety that triggered it. Nicholls conceit of looking in on Dex and Em once a year worked more successfully in the novel than it does in the film. The literary medium is more sensitive to the changes in heart and head while the visual one more alert to changes in costume and hair. The performances are overeager. Particularly distracting is Hathaways accent which is less Yorkshire than New York. (Compare her accent to the pitch-perfect Patricia Clarkson excellent as Dexters patrician mother.) Yet the vignettes of the yo-yo friendship and mutual attraction between these two beautiful animals have their insights and charms. Who knows you better than your best friend? Whos there to support you when you wobble cheer you when you soar? Nicholls story notes envy between friends at career asymmetry where one is on the rise and the other on the decline. As in An Education Scherfigs settings are unshowy imparting period flavor without overwhelming what is ultimately an underwhelming film.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""One Day"" wont set the world on fire but it radiates pleasing warmth. The story line -- virtuous working-class girl tames wealthy charmer -- has been reliably jerking hearts since Jane Austen was in diapers. The characters are a bit more complex and believable than the mannequins usually found in romantic comedy-drama and the European locations are nearly as eye-catching as the lead actors. Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) begin their relationship on the day they ought to be parting. Following their college graduation on July 15 1988 the virtual strangers tumble into Emmas bed. Their less-than-perfect union would have Bridget Jones cringing in embarrassment but the pair laugh off their initial encounter and become unlikely friends. The film based on a bestselling book by David Nicholls follows them by observing anniversaries of their meeting over the course of more than 20 years. If youve seen ""The Way We Were"" or ""Same Time Next Year"" you know the drill. Sunrise sunset disconnecting reconnecting laughter tears babies. But Nicholls screenplay and the direction by Lone (""An Education"") Scherfig respect our intelligence. The opening scene of graduation-night carousing in Edinburgh implies a lot without any clumsy exposition. Hardworking Emma has bootstrapped her way up to a midlevel university while Dex the ladies man and bon vivant fell short of the prestigious schools his peers are attending. While Anne Hathaway can coast through a film on her saucer-eyed stare and kilowatt smile she makes Emma more than a collection of tricks and tics. Shes proud yet easily wounded. Her hangdog expression while waitressing in a downscale Mexican restaurant is eloquent about her foiled expectations. A would-be writer in a straw sombrero passing out menus is not a happy sight. Shes bright charming and dedicated to her dream career as an author yet her wavering confidence and propensity for sarcastic wit humanize her. Theres enough drama in the part to pave Hathaways path to roles beyond romcom It Girl. The chick-flick algorithm dictates that whatever level of fame the star occupies the male lead must be at least one step down. Sturgess (second-billed in ""Across the Universe"" which no one saw) is not a bad actor but hes light on personal magnetism. As Emmas deeply flawed crush he spirals downward from his upper-class origins hosting a tacky TV variety show and soothing his ego with drugs alcohol and unseemly women. Its puzzling why the pairs attraction remains so fondly steadfast through their many romantic near-misses shouldas couldas and wouldas. Thats why its called fiction I guess. Giles Keyte Focus Features Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess in ""One Day"" Over the years Emma grows sophisticated trading her girlish sundresses and clompy boots for heels and couture while life-battered Dex comes to appreciate good old Emma as more than a source of sympathy. The film doesnt end with a happily-ever-after fadeout but a tougher emotionally satisfying resolution. ""One Day"" is a winning late-summer flight of fancy with a good lesson about making amends for ones misused life opportunities.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies One Day A Page Turner Becomes a Head Scratcher Even with cute stars Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess this adaptation of David Nicholls best-selling novel lacks the punch of its source material By Mary Pols MaryPolsAug. 18 2011 Share Read Later Giles Keyte / Universal PicturesAnne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess star in the romance movie One Day directed by Lone Scherfig Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Lazy bourgeois Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgess) and feisty liberal Emma Morley (Anne Hathaway) land in bed together in 1988 the night of their graduation from an English university. Emma is strident and nervous. Dex is a selfish cad and she wants him to know she knows this -- but she also wants him. Hes attracted and amused at first then deflated; their pawing subsides into cuddling. Yet the attraction simmers on for the better part of the next two decades. What? Twenty years of opposites attracting and repelling? Even Sam Malone and Diane Chambers took only five from beginning to end. No wonder Hathaway looks so tired and sad in the opening shots of One Day as she bikes through English streets in 2006 shes been on a marathon. But the movie based on David Nicholls best-selling 2009 novel of the same name might have been a lot longer. Nicholls charming novel had a Same Time Next Year-style premise checking in on Dex and Em every single July 15 for 20 years wherever they might be on that day; in adapting his book for the screen Nicholls skips some years and does some compression of events. Even in the skillful hands of director Lone Scherfig (An Education Italian for Beginners) the effect is disjointed. The characters that Nicholls brought so cunningly to life in the book feel rushed through a timeline tied to an agenda. Dexs and Ems individual disappointments and triumphs arent properly developed and their romantic destiny has a pat certainty to it. Its inevitable that Dex will outgrow his bimbo phase and that Em will ditch the humorless stand-up comedian she met while working in a Mexican restaurant. (Hes played by Rafe Spall actor Timothys son.) The movie is no page turner. Though Sturgess and Hathaway are appealing theres a distracting level of awareness when they are playing younger than they are (he is 33 she 28) and then older a sense that they are always betwixt and between. Hathaway suffers from uneven-accent syndrome (why not cast a Brit?) and overplays Ems tendency toward archness but Sturgess (Across the Universe) nails Dexs disreputable-little-boy act. His interactions with his disapproving cancer-riddled mother played by Patricia Clarkson (if ever a woman could dress you down with her eyes) are just right and so is his stint as an obnoxious late-night television host. When the worm turns however hes wan and less convincing. Its beyond strange that the primary fault of One Day lies with the screenplay. Nicholls is not inexperienced; he did a nice job adapting his novel Starter for Ten for the movies. How could he -- having provided such vivid snapshots not just of Dex and Ems lives but of the culture and world around them on these many July 15s -- write such a hazy movie? One Day is a Nick Hornby-style beach read a novel that engages so swiftly that reading takes precedent over the next swim or cocktail. It also featured a surprise ending (no spoilers promise) that while certainly a master manipulation gave the book ballast. Here the same writer takes that out-of-nowhere ending and heavily clumsily foreshadows it. Did he do it because moviegoers are trained to expect certain sorts of endings to follow from certain kinds of beginnings? Whatever the cause its a graceless change and One Day such a treat on the page ends up being just another day at the movies.

"One Day (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review One Day (PG-13) David Nicholls novel about a couple who get a glimpse into the future makes an effective leap to the screen. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald8/17/2011 Editor rating 3 By pretty much anybodys evaluation Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgess) is a jerk. Hes cocky and full of himself a ladies man with appallingly low standards for bedmates (""breathing"" seems to be the main qualification he seeks). Hes not dumb but his ambition in terms of career centers largely on a ill-defined desire for fame. Many of his issues can be attributed to privilege youth and an almost pathological revulsion toward thinking serious thoughts factors that might fade if he matures. But during his young adulthood even his mum thinks hes something of a tool. Whether the Nick Hornbyesque manboy Dex will ever grow up is a concern to his best friend Emma Morley (Anne Hathaway) who is not-so-secretly in love with him but also unwilling to sacrifice their friendship for what is sure to be a thoughtless roll in the hay. She understands theres someone of value under Dexs pretty arrogant exterior but shes not a fool. She cant quite banish him from her life and so goes about adjusting to the ups and downs of adulthood anyway.Efficiently adapted for the screen by David Nicholls from his bestselling novel One Day follows the lives of Dex and Em specifically what happens to them every July 15 for almost 20 years. The conceit was much easier to pull off in print what with chapters and time and space to linger over the connections that keep these two characters close over the years. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) doesnt have such luxury but she infuses her snapshots of their relationship with humor and poignancy. The film is mostly made up of deftly drawn character sketches as Dex and Em bicker vacation together find new careers fall in love with other people and manage to stay friends throughout. Mostly. Hathaway of course is far more gorgeous than the modestly attractive Em should be but Scherfig even manages to make her briefly frumpy (note to fans of the book Remember that a movie also tried to make us believe Renee Zellweger was a few pounds overweight in Bridget Joness Diary). The fact that she doesnt sit around and wait for Dexter to wake up to the inevitable keeps her from seeming pathetic. Sturgess has an even trickier part; he has to be charming enough for the audience to buy into Emmas hopes that hell be a decent man even when hes saying appalling things or mistreating her but not so disarming that we dont see he has a long way to go. Watching One Day youll assume that Dex and Em will end up together. This is a movie after all. But while he gives in to some expectations Nicholls thwarts a few here One Day turns out to be less about enjoying a traditional happy ending than an admonishment to stop wasting time get on with the business of living and enjoy every single moment with the ones you love.

"One Day movie review by Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs One Day of their livesFilm slathers a book of comic romance with an excess of pathos -- 2 starsAugust 18 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticLike ""Same Time Next Year"" with less guilt or ""When Harry Met Sally ... "" with a somewhat different ending ""One Day"" pops in and out of the lives of characters played by Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess across two decades spanning university graduation to older wiser 40-dom. A huge hit in England and elsewhere David Nicholls clever best-seller comes to the movies in an adaptation Nicholls himself wrote. Lone Scherfig lately of ""An Education"" directed. Strong pedigree for this sort of thing.Yet the tone has shifted from page to screen. The pathos which the book wore lightly now comes at you in ""Cry damn it"" fashion. Many I suspect will comply. The film is far from cheap or slovenly and its attractive. But when a movie inflates the importance of a love story that is predominantly comic in tone even with a fair share of grief and loss built into the plot that love story takes on more than it can handle.In arrogant but sweet Dexter (played by Sturgess) novelist and screenwriter Nicholls has created the sort of male protagonist female readers and viewers want to protect from harm and then take to bed. We meet the whip-smart wisecrack-dispenser Emma (Hathaway hobbled by her own studious middle-class English dialect) when shes celebrating Glasgow university graduation with Dexter a boy-man of virtually unlimited funds and preening self-regard. In the book Nicholls describes Dexter as having ""the knack of looking perpetually posed for a photograph."" Their initial encounter takes place on July 15 St. Swithins Day in 1988. They go their separate ways but never for long always wondering if theyre meant to be more than pals with those benefits every other movie this summer is pushing.Emma putters through her life for a while moving in with an aggravating stand-up comic played aggravatingly by Rafe Spall (son of Timothy). Why does she do this? So that there will be no question regarding whom Emma should be with. As she slouches toward a career as a teacher and then a writer soul mate Dexter finds fame and agitating fortune (plus drugs plus drink) as a TV personality all the while earning the disdain of his parents. His mother played by the reliably excellent Patricia Clarkson suffers a health crisis. The films credo is summed up by the phrase ""Whatever happens tomorrow weve had today.""Emma and Dexters adventures on the road together and at home apart pepper the screen like a series of attractive postcards. Hathaway works hard and shes an astute actress but her wide-eyed demeanor and on-the-nose delivery suggest she has a hard time throwing away a line of dialogue even when its designed to be tossed off rather than hammered neatly in place. Sturgess captures the louche narcissism of Dexter well enough though he lacks wit and an animating spark.Forward it goes through the years. What proved tasty in book form comes across a little more like work in the movie.mjphillipstribune.comOne Day -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual content partial nudity language some violence and substance abuse)Cast Anne Hathaway (Emma); Jim Sturgess (Dexter); Patricia Clarkson (Alison); Ken Stott (Steven); Romola Garai (Sylvie); Rafe Spall (Ian)Credits Directed by Lone Scherfig; written by David Nicholls based on his novel; produced by Nina Jacobson.

As the longsuffering female half of the couple Anne Hathaway is the exact opposite of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl stereotype She has her own goals (largely to become a world-changing poet) and setbacks (world-changing poets arent common) and shes more serious mature and emotionally burdened than her opposite number spoiled playboy Jim Sturgess. And yet she seems to exist largely as Sturgess adjunct rather than an equal character even as they both get roughly the same screen time. Their story begins with their college graduation where Hathaway tries inexpertly to seduce Sturgess but they botch the assignation; One Day then checks in with them on the same day each year and finds her emotionally fixated on him but unwilling to settle for being just another in his long string of easy lays. While she cynically embraces the failure of her dreams and takes up a grimly unsatisfying waitressing job and an equally unsatisfying long-term relationship he travels the world becomes a popular TV personality drinks and does drugs and fucks struggles to accept that his mother (Patricia Clarkson) is dying tries to maneuver Hathaway into the sack while maintaining his freewheeling lifestyle and generally acts like an asshole. For him much of the film is a downward spiral and a long climb back up; Hathaway his one loyal friend is either there for him or isnt depending on what her pride and his bad behavior will allow. All this is slickly entertaining in the manner of a high-concept energetic romantic comedy coasting on the leads charm and their sprightly dialogues. But the movie maintains a sour undercurrent of emotional imbalance as Sturgess neediness and hatefulness dominate the story even as he remains the more dynamic and protean personality. Director Lone Scherfig (An Education) and screenwriter David Nicholls (adapting his novel as he did with Starter For 10) stage much of the leads relationship as though it were a single long-running conversation which often makes the one-day-a-year structure feel forced and unlikely though it is intriguing watching the characters mature and change over a broad swath of time. Still the ultimate end of the story reveals that its all about Sturgess suffering which just isnt that compelling a topic. Given its lack of center and balance the film might more appropriately be called One Dude.

That distinction belongs to the eponymous structure a claustrophobic device that follows a pair of best friends over the course of a 22-year period but only on many versions of July 15th. Locked into this oppressive structure from start to finish ""One Day"" continually reboots its tone. Initially the platonic relationship of recent college grads Emma (Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) comes across like a serene take on ""When Harry Met Sally"" before it drifts into darker territory. However from one year to the next ""One Day"" avoids fleshing out the story and tells the same one over and over again. Adapted from David Nicholls novel by Lone Scherfig (working with Nicholls screenplay) ""One Day"" finds the director with enough momentum from the success of her astute period piece ""An Education"" to deliver a similarly delicate two-hander but in this case the narrative lacks a strategic purpose. After agreeing to remain friends when their bedroom antics dont pan out in 1988 Emma and Dexter become consultants in each others fluctuating lifestyles. While Emma remains stuck in a dead-end waitressing gig and Dexter turns into a vapid television star they look to each other to broadcast their complaints. Time passes with the ease of the caption that repeatedly pops up on the screen. Benoit Delhommes cinematography lends a sunny expressive vibe to the proceedings and a chronologically astute soundtrack keys us into each new period by playing the singles of the moment. The actors are game to show the wear and tear of the aging in virtually every other scene but the speed of their progress grows tiresome. Scherfig constantly hits the reboot button moving the actors closer together from year to year but casting them in the same uninspired melodramatic romance. Covering 22 years of ups and downs ""One Day"" oscillates between Emmas dissatisfied relationship with an unfunny comic (Rafe Spall) and Dexs grief over an estranged relationship with his late mother (Patricia Clarkson). In dialogue (and sometimes on vacation) with each other the two pals grow increasingly certain that they belong together. For a while this ritualistic acknowledgement works thanks to the fundamental appeal that both actors bring to their perpetually lonesome characters. But the story never allows them to develop beyond the plot demands that they grow slightly older and wiser every few minutes. After a dozen years worth of scenes ""One Day"" lags before it goes into a tailspin. Scherfig ably directs terse exchanges and fawning expressions of the two leads mounting desires but cant find the connective tissue to string it all together. ""One Day"" works as a succession of short films each demonstrating the potential for a greater story locked away in the context of another unexplored year. As a single work however its just a string of do-overs. criticWIRE grade B- HOW WILL IT PLAY? With the charisma of its two leads and a one-sheet that suggests gentle summer counterprogramming to the bigger blockbuster fare ""One Day"" is likely to do solid business at the box office in limited release for its first weekend but probably wont gain much traction in awards season.

One Day Bad Director Lone Scherfig. Cast Anne Hathaway Jim Sturgess Ken Stott Jodie Whittaker. Rating PG-13 for sexual content partial nudity language violence and substance abuse. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Anne Hathaway Cute huh? Well no not really. In fact the idea turns out to be a major drag killing any momentum the film may have gathered. We simply zoom in and zoom out of the characters lives rather than develop any kind of emotional attachment to them. Then again spending a concentrated period of time with these two bores couldnt have made things any smoother. We meet the characters on the day they graduate from university in England. Dexter (Jim Sturgess) is a wealthy charming rogue who lacks direction. Emma (Anne Hathaway) is a brainy idealist. The movie deals in a lazy kind of shorthand; we learn about Emma because she listens to Tracy Chapman and is seen with the slogan ""Nuclear Disarmament Now."" The movie drifts in and out while the two never seem to be on the same page romantically. He gets famous as an obnoxious TV host develops a drug problem cleans up and starts a family. She works in a Mexican restaurant dreams of a writing career and finally finds success plus an ooh-la-la French apartment and beau. And along the way we notice the times change because the soundtrack plays nostalgic pop songs - if its Ronan Keating it must be the early 2000s The idea of dropping in on characters at different points in their lives can work - see ""Same Time Next Year"" for how it should be done. Here it simply puts a distance between the audience and two characters that arent that interesting to start with. This is one of those movies that never feels grounded in reality. You never sense any chemistry between the leads. You dont buy what happens to the characters; instead it feels like the screenwriter (David Nicholls adapting his book) merely yanks them from one situation to the next particularly in the movies final moments. Perhaps most obvious to anyone who has seen the trailer its really tough to buy Anne Hathaway struggling to pass herself off as a British native. The accent is unconvincing throughout; couldnt the moviemakers have just made the character an exchange student from New Jersey once they cast Hathaway in the role? Still maybe the target audience for this kind of romance wont care. After all this is the type of movie in which the heroine is supposed to appear plain even though its obvious she is only a pair of contact lenses and a good hair defrizzer away from looking like a movie star.

Its not exactly ""boy meets girl"" but thats the best that the new romance ""One Day"" based on a bestselling novel that I have not read has to offer. Author David Nicholls may have made these characters more substantial on the page but in the big-screen adaptation (which he wrote) the leads are so lightweight and barely-there that a stiff breeze in the projection booth could make them disappear entirely. And since the whole movie is about the two of them and whether  they ever get together thats kind of a problem. On July 15 1988 Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) hook up at the end of a drunken night celebrating their graduation from college. (Sorry university Theyre supposed to be from the U.K. although if you didnt get that from Hathaways vague accent youre not alone.) Whats supposed to be a booty call gets terribly awkward -- she puts Tracy Chapmans ""Talkin bout a Revolution"" on as mood music he gets dressed to leave while shes prepping in the bathroom -- and then leads to what will become a lifelong friendship. And so we check in with these two every July 15 and observe the passage of time and the ups and downs of their lives. Emma spins her wheels waiting tables at a Mexican restaurant and dating an untalented would-be stand-up comic (Rafe Spall) while Dex becomes a D-bag television personality and all-around shallow jerk. (One of the laziest tropes in contemporary fiction is to make one of your characters become famous and ""One Day"" does it twice as Emma eventually blossoms into a successful author of young-adult fiction complete with Audrey Hepburn-esque makeover.) Along the way characters die relationships begin and fall apart but Emma and Dex somehow stay close and keep their unrequited love burning between them. But why exactly? ""One Day"" never bothers to spell out for us just who these people are what they want or why they do what they do. So its next to impossible to get revved up about their feelings for each other except for the fact that Emma and Dex are the principal characters and theyre being played by attractive charismatic performers. Nicholls wafer-thin screenplay eventually beats down both Hathaway and Sturgess who try desperately to give this couple something approximating depth. And the whole same-time-next-year business -- which must have worked on the page since the novel was huge with the book-club set -- winds up feeling gimmicky and pointless. Jumping through the turn of the 21st century was no doubt lots of fun for the hair and wardrobe department -- Hathaway spends the first chunk of the film being frumped up with unflattering glasses and outfits but Sturgess goes from posh preppy to 90s fashion victim sporting an array of looks youd prayed would never return. (If only any of Sturgess lines had been as interesting as his hairdos.) The music supervisor had a bit of a lark as well throwing in Clinton-era jams from the likes of Fatboy Slim and Del Amitri with some Robbie Williams karaoke thrown in once the film makes it to the 2000s. But theres only so much fun to be had with ""Jurassic Park"" references denim vests and ""Sowing the Seeds of Love."" Rather than tell a story that would organically elicit certain emotions it feels like Nicholls and director Lone Scherfig (""An Education"") want us to yearn wistfully here and tear up there and then they set out to create moments that would hit those marks. So were left with a plot that feels forced (and subsequently predictable) being acted out by ciphers. Patricia Clarkson as Dexs mother shines brightest among the cast even though shes saddled with a thankless role thats all wise advice and the stoic avoidance of tears in a time of crisis. Shes taken the pudding cup the movie gives her and somehow transforms it into chocolate mousse. The people behind ""One Day"" no doubt thought that the passing of the years within the story would be a potent reminder of how life slips right by us but the more likely response is along the lines of ""Ugh its only 2008? Is this movie ever going to be over?"" Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Daily Edition Login to download One Day Film Review 900 AM PDT 8/17/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Focus Features An unusual but ultimately successful piecemeal approach to romantic drama that follows a couple on the same day for each of 20 years. TWITTER Danish director Lone Scherfig skillfully adapts David Nichollsa best-selling romantic novel to the screen. Lone Scherfig the Danish director who is fast becoming one of the foremost interpreters of British culture has performed a bit of magic in One Day the film adaptation of David Nicholls best-selling novel. The literary conceit behind the novel was that a reader could track the lives and friendship of two characters -- lower class politically engaged Emma Morley and wealthy handsome Dexter Mayhew -- over two decades through a brief snapshot of their evolving relationship revealed on a single day that being July 15 of each year. In this film version Scherfig (An Education) has orchestrated each short segment so the episodes flow smoothly together making it feel of a whole rather than disjointed bits with costume changes. The classic three-act structure of most romantic dramas isnt so much dismissed as subverted into tiny beats that chart the ups-and-downs of a relationship that threatens to turn romantic about as often as it threatens to crumble apart. With two glamorous stars in Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess and an appealing mix of romantic locations the Focus Features movie should attract a following from college age upwards no doubt skewing toward female audiences. Nicholls adapted his own novel to the screen but someone along the way -- Scherfig? -- gave him some killer notes for he has considerably improved the story from his novel. The novel represented one of the longest cases of coitus interruptus in literary history. It began with the couple newly graduated from university in Edinburgh in bed in 1988 but they dont consummate their feelings for one another until 2001 Much worse the novels Dex is a louse from Day One. Which makes Em a loser for mooning over him for so many years. In the movie though Nicholls has considerably freshened up his male protagonist by letting his charm and not his alcoholism shine through the early years. Drink only takes its toll as his career as a ""TV presenter"" collapses. Now you see what Em sees in Dex -- and why she fights for him to reclaim his better side. Other than reducing Dexs globetrotting to occasional excursions to France the movie stays true to the novels dramatic trajectory but makes each character more likeable and less bedraggled. You actually now root for them to hook up and wonder (as you do in the novel) what takes them so long. They do begin in Emmas bed on the dawn following graduation night. This is July 15 1988 which is St. Swithin Day in Britain the thematic purpose of which is never announced. Ems glasses are supposed to make her an ugly duckling -- with Hathaway in the role this hoary device fails miserably -- but she does catch the young womans coltish behavior and sly wit very well. Meanwhile Sturgess is the epitome of an impetuous charmer that nevertheless has a talent for self-destruction something a young woman might find dangerously attractive. The movie rushes through their lighthearted early years as good friends where Em finds the temerity to call Dexs dad (Ken Stott) a ""bourgeois fascist"" -- this remark occurs off-camera -- and Dex finds himself enormously attracted to Em only to admit he feels that way about nearly every pretty woman he encounters. His TV career skyrockets while Em struggles to find herself in low-wage jobs as a waitress at a horrible Mexican restaurant in London and later as a teacher. Eventually Dex crashes to earth at more or less the same time Em becomes an accomplished writer of childrens books. The point is made and then made again that Dex is at his best whenever Em is around. Otherwise as his mother (Patricia Clarkson) sadly says ""I worry that youre not very nice anymore."" Em develops a relationship with a third-rate stand-up comic Ian (Rafe Spall) which is clearly a mistake while Dex runs through girlfriends such as over-caffeinated fellow presenter Suki (Georgia King) to wind up finally married to the lovely but high maintenance Sylvie (Romola Garai) with whom he has a daughter. Supporting characters are even more peripheral in the movie -- quick sketches of personalities to indicate the passage of interests by the protagonists. Those that are allowed to emerge more fully as time passes are Dexs parents his moral compass when Em is not around and Ian the comic who feels he must be perpetually ""on"" to keep people even his girlfriend entertained. Getting somewhat lost in the transition to the screen is Ems intellectual curiosity her social conscience and ambitions. Dex calls her the ""smartest person I know"" but you dont really know why. What is thankfullylost in transition though is Dexs continual irresponsibility and thoughtlessness. This is considerably toned down here so he is able as his mother predicts to become a good man. Scherfig makes the most of each segment cleverly introduced by on-screen titles that blend into each new scene. She zeroes in on quick dialogue exchanges or transitional elements to establish new situations and priorities then moves the relationship at the heart of her story along with considerable skill. Working with editor Barney Pilling the director turns the evolution of Em and Dex into a contemplation on friendship and love that is in direct contrast to the wham-bam-thank-you-mam of many screen romances. In a curious way this movie is the direct inversion of another fine romantic film this summer Friends With Benefits. That film drenched the couple in sex only for love to emerge. Here a friendship begun with a deep need for the other persons companionship and approval only gradually gives way to romance and then love. The filmmakers wisely chose not to place much emphasis on aging their fairly young actors but rather leave this up to these capable thespians. Hathaway who has a convincing English accent does shorten her hair for the later sequences but more importantly she shows you that Em has slowly come to learn and accept who she is and become much stronger for this evolution. With this film Sturgess stakes his claim as the new Hugh Grant only without the fussy mannerisms that has infected many of the latters performances. Sturgess can now play any number of charming Englishmen with any number of weaknesses and flaws that women easily forgive. Cinematographer Benoit Delhomme and production designer Mark Tidesley give the drama the gloss of the films many splendid locations around Edinburgh Paris London and various country and sea sides without indulging in too much nostalgia for the changing periods. Rachel Portmans lush and wistful score accentuates the films themes and the ultimate melancholy that comes in the final chapter of Em and Dex.

Though anchored by its appealing leads and directed by Lone Scherfig with customary snap and polish ""One Day"" rather too dutifully chronicles the 20-year relationship between two smart attractive Brits charting the incremental shifts from flirtation and friendship to hard-won commitment. On a moment-by-moment basis Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess make this long-arc love story viable sometimes even vital. But the structural conceit proves more reductive than expansive the big picture too overdetermined to really sweep the viewer away. Itll do well in ancillary one day but theatrically Focus will rely on Hathaway to win over a modest arthouse niche. Indeed the actress seems to have been chosen more for her Stateside commercial appeal than her natural affinity for the role; while she acquitted herself well in the British costume drama ""Becoming Jane"" (2007) Hathaway at first feels slightly miscast here as Emma Morley whose Yorkshire background comes with a particularly tricky accent to master. But the thesps quick intelligence and inner spark assert themselves in no time making the bookish Emma a shrewd foil for Dexter Mayhew (Sturgess) the rakish charmer with whom she spends a chaste but intimate evening in her U. of Edinburgh flat. That fateful one-night quasi-stand takes place July 15 1988. The next scene is set on July 15 1989 as Dexter helps Emma move into her new London digs their easy banter making it clear theyve become best friends. A year and a scene later Emma is slaving away aimlessly at a Mexican restaurant while Dexter enjoys a more glamorous summer in Paris with his mother (Patricia Clarkson). July 15 1992 finds the duo vacationing on the Brittany coast with Emma drawing strict boundaries that Dexter is all too willing to violate as becomes clear in a skinny-dipping episode that comically backfires. And so the film goes skipping dexterously so to speak from one year to the next until the present day its story coalescing in scraps of narrative and slivers of feeling. While Emma struggles to make something of her writerly ambitions Dexter becomes a famous TV personality his boozy celebrity lifestyle driving a wedge between him and his loved ones. He navigates an endless series of girlfriends eventually marrying and having a child with upper-class Sylvie (Romola Garai) while Emma tries to settle down with Ian (Rafe Spall) a good guy she doesnt love. For all the many ups and downs they must endure before (and after) their magic moment Dex and Em are clearly destined for one another. To put it another way they are captives of a rigid chronological schema devised by screenwriter David Nicholls somewhat too faithfully adapting his deservedly popular 2009 novel. The books more contrived developments -- the parallels and contrasts drawn between the two at various life stages the recurring dramatic significance of July 15 -- were lent conviction by the authors lively perceptive prose his ability to fill out each snapshot with psychological detail and background texture. Nicholls script more or less distills the essence of each chapter in a series of tight reasonably well-shaped scenes but a crucial element of depth and spontaneity is missing. Time one of the storys key subjects turns out not to be on the films side. This places a considerable burden on the lead actors to express Dexter and Emmas rich interior life as well as their essential rightness for one another which they pull off with aplomb. Sporting a what-me-worry grin that tells only half the story Sturgess nails his portrait of an irresponsible party animal whose 15 minutes of fame leave him in serious need of redemption and detox. If Hathaway seems a less obvious fit for Emma the fact that shes playing the more likable dependable character in the equation quickly gets the viewer on her side. Like Hathaway Clarkson projects such a familiar down-home American attitude that one initially has trouble buying her as a Brit though her performance makes up in emotional truth what it may lack in linguistic precision. Supporting cast is excellent all around; Ken Stott reveals shades of tenderness beneath a gruff exterior as Dexters father while Garai and Spall deliver sympathetic perfectly judged turns as the other girl and guy respectively. Scherfigs follow-up to her 60s-set ""An Education"" finds her again incisively exploring the London of the past albeit the much more recent past. Benoit Delhommes fine widescreen lensing captures a city of cramped living quarters crummy local dives and pulsing nightclubs favoring more attractive postcard-like views of Paris and Edinburgh in key sequences. Rachel Portmans treacly score aside the soundtrack is a bit too fastidious in piling on the 90s hits; a similar attentiveness governs Odile Dicks-Mireauxs costume choices right down to the ""Chinese-style affair of rich blue silk"" Nicholls describes Emma as wearing to a friends wedding. Thesps wardrobe hair and makeup pull off the illusion of subtle aging despite Hathaways occasionally over-conspicuous changes in coiffure. Titles indicating the passing of each year are in line with the classy production package.

That book critic now wants to ask this movie critic what went wrong. Conveniently both critics are me. But first the Hollywood-ready setup Emma Morley (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter Mayhew (Across the Universes Jim Sturgess) meet in 1988 on the day of their graduation from the University of Edinburgh. Hes a rich hottie for whom everything has come easily especially women. Shes a funky scholarly wonk from working-class stock with aspirations of being a writer and little luck with men. The two spend a kind of cutely awful night together followed by a restoratively radiant day after that suggests the two are obviously meant for each other. Of course they dont know that yet. In fact in the way of Jane Austen novels and When Harry Met Sally... they dont know it for years during which Emma and Dexter are Just Best Friends -- albeit the kind of BFs who pine for one anothers company even as their day-to-day circumstances separate them even further over the years. To dramatize the passage of time both the book and the movie versions of One Day check in on Em and Dex every year for 20 years always on the July anniversary of their meeting to create a portrait of one couples love in all its happiness sadness confusion and excitement. Which comes back to the conundrum of the artful book versus the stilted movie -- both of them written by David Nicholls an engaging novelist-screenwriter (and former actor) who previously turned his 2003 novel Starter for Ten also about university-level romance and class consciousness into a nifty little 2007 movie of the same name starring James McAvoy. Why the fumble? To begin with the casting is tragically fatefully off. Im not of the no-American-can-play-a-Brit school of casting (Renee Zellweger will forever be my Bridget Jones) but Anne Hathaways rangy American gameness big smile and shining good health are the physical and psychological opposite of what makes Emma more than just an awkward duckling who takes a very long time to become a swan. Emma is meant to be all about self-disparaging little bons mots and quips and references with which she attempts to keep her spirits up while stuck in a miserable restaurant-service job dating an unfunny aspiring comedian. Hathaway meanwhile looks like she could just chomp down on Sturgess Dex and swallow him like a Dove Bar with a lipsticked grin. And as a result unsurprisingly Sturgess looks none too happy -- even more unhappy than Dex deserves to be as he temporarily slides into heavy drinking and a shallow job as host of a crap VH1-lite TV show. (Patricia Clarkson adds her own bit of Yankee-made Britishness as Dexters terribly glamorous doting upper-class mum.) Then further unraveling With the casting discordance the dialogue doesnt flow with anything resembling ease or even tonal logic. Danish director Lone Scherfig demonstrated her ability to infuse a talky script with plenty of wordless mood in An Education. But in One Day the words -- many of them taken directly from the book -- are never convincing. The choices Emma and Dexter make on the page feel inevitable even when the reader knows theyre bad choices. The choices they make on the screen look arbitrary -- which is much worse than bad or wrongheaded any day.

Shes nursing a crush on Dexter (Jim Sturgess) her too-good-looking rich-boy college classmate. Shes earnest tenacious and crippled by middle-class insecurity; hes talentless and slides by on smile and swagger. Its July 15 1988 and after a long night of post-graduation drinking Em and Dex fall into bed--and instead of having sex agree to be friends. The film then follows the pair through two decades worth of July 15s their mutual attraction ebbing and flowing toward a long-delayed but clearly inevitable consummation.The premise would seem ripe for a minimalist-realist treatment--you could imagine this done Jeanne Dielman-style with all the stuff of life spectacular or mundane given equal time and weight--but neither Nicholls nor Scherfig is so conceptually inclined. In their hands July 15 becomes the anniversary not only of Em and Dexs first meeting but also most of the landmark moments in their lives including a major rift their most significant hookup their decision to procreate and finally a fateful accident--which (spoiler alert sort of) is teased in the films opening scene. This is a deviation from the novel. Its as if the filmmakers are afraid that if we dont know that Something Big happens in 2006 well leave the theater before the movie gets there. In keeping with the novel the films most romantic scene which should occur chronologically near the beginning is saved for last resurrecting a relationship that we know is intractably finished. Its nonlinearity for the sole purpose of emotional manipulation.""Sense of humor is overrated"" Emma says at one point and while she means it ironically the true irony is that One Days sense of humor is sorely lacking. Hathaway and Sturgess oversell the scripts wan attempts at wisecracks which are already broad enough. (When shagging a French girl makes him late for an appointment Dexter winkingly explains that he was ""waylaid."") Hathaway falls into a mugging performance from her stint as co-host of the Oscars where James Francos somnambulant apathy threw her impatient perfectionism into relief. She gives a similarly agitated turn here often all but underlining a line reading in smug satisfaction sometimes rushing through them as if to distract from her dodgy hodgepodge British accent.The actresss apparent inability to relax exacerbates One Days relentless forward motion. Emma and Dexters coupling has not a single serious obstacle; each manages to hack together just one significant relationship with someone else and both of those someone elses are patently intolerable from frame one. And yet Scherfig and her actors are never able to sell the notion that these two are divinely matched. They parry and bicker for years without generating heat their bond seemingly as superficial as the laughable makeup meant to age the stars into their forties through which neither looks a day over 28. (Its notable that Scherfigs version of evoking period is limited to rib-nudging about outdated fashion forgettable pop and the evolution of the cell-phone).Scherfigs 2000 Silver Bear-winning Italian For Beginners proved that the austere strictures of Danish filmmaking movement Dogme 95 could accommodate a fizzy Miramax-primed Euro-rom-com. Her first major English-language feature An Education premiered distributor-less at Sundance and was eventually nominated for three Oscars. One Day may be a departure from these nominal indies in its comparatively high budget and star wattage but it also seems like the logical destination for a filmmaker whose work has always betrayed an ambition to make middlebrow American movies with a straight-faced reverence that in this day and age perhaps only a foreigner could pull off. But for an entry in a genre of films that frequently work as guilty pleasures even at their most formulaic One Day doesnt offer much pleasure.Relying on costuming to tells us who her characters are and an omnipresent score to tell us how they feel Scherfig cant conjure the spark or swoon of what appear to be her Hollywood models of tragi-romance. Great Hollywood melodrama is art; One Day is kitsch.
