Me and my friends went round our mates and my girlfriends best friend chose this film out.

The thriller part of the film (which is most of it) was really good I was wondering what was going on when Kale and his friends were watching Turner and at certain parts I expected him to jump out and kill someone. And when he didnt but the characters were missing I was completely hooked There was one big in the film that I exc;aimed ""Oh hell no"" and it turned out to be a joke on Kale. Once we got into the horror part I was amazed.

"Disturbia Gen Y Hitchcock homage | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDisturbia Gen Y Hitchcock homageWe might ordinarily take the flaming bag of dog poo tossed onto Shia LaBeoufs doorstep in Disturbia to be symbolic of the movies odorous motives.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. April 13 2007 Starring Shia LaBeouf David Morse Carrie-Anne Moss Aaron Yoo and Sarah Roemer. Directed by D.J. Caruso. 104 minutes. At major theatres. PG  We might ordinarily take the flaming bag of dog poo tossed onto Shia LaBeoufs doorstep in Disturbia to be symbolic of the movies odorous motives.Article Continued BelowThis shameless rip of Alfred Hitchcocks classic thriller Rear Window is product with a capital ""P"" as much as the Red Bull Twinkies iPods and Xboxes that are relentlessly hustled throughout it. Yet that flaming bag wont bounce onto your lap. Director D.J. Caruso and his able star LaBeouf are up to more than just selling out and selling off the old master. While Disturbia does nothing to advance or honour Hitchcock the movie succeeds on its modest terms if you dont tax too many brain cells in parsing its mammoth logic gaps. This is chiefly due to the considerable acting talents of LaBeouf who is still waiting for the right picture.In truth the youth market Disturbia is aimed at probably doesnt know or care about Rear Window and its jumpy voyeur. Younger viewers may not even be aware of the Robert Zemeckis-Hitchcock homage What Lies Beneath from 2000 or any of the innumerable other Rear Window clones.Thats all to the good since director Caruso (The Salton Sea) and screenwriters Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth arent out to challenge anything more than popcorn sales.About the only thing new with this telling is the age of the window-gazing protagonist. LaBeoufs character Kale is possibly the youngest ever to slip into Jimmy Stewarts shoes as the suspicious neighbour.Kale is a high school student who is sentenced to three months house arrest after punching out a teacher. Hes not really a bad sort but a tragedy revealed in the prologue has left him sullen and distant.Hes obliged to wear a transmitter on his leg that will summon the police should he attempt to stray from the grounds of the home he shares with his mother (Carrie-Anne Moss too young for the role).The radio harness doesnt stop Kale from hanging with his doofus buddy Ronnie (Aaron Yoo another casting find) but it does hamper his efforts to make time with the hottie Ashley (Sarah Roemer) who just moved in next door. Good thing Ashley enjoys a challenge.Kale has also started noticing another neighbour from his bedroom window perch. Guy-next-door Robert Turner (David Morse) has creepy nocturnal habits.Women come to Turners house but they dont always seem to leave. Kale also notices a telltale dent in the fender on Turners car which just happens to match the police description of the conveyance used by a serial killer who is on the loose.Kale may be jumping to conclusions. Turner seems pleasant enough and hes sweet on Kales mom. But Kales also resourceful enough to do some sleuthing with Ronnie acting as his legs while Kale watches the action via binoculars and security camera. The kid is a regular Inspector Gadget. The static set and the intense emotional and physical demands on Kale would tax many young actors but LaBoeuf effortlessly fits the role. He manages to turn a largely unsympathetic character into a heroic Everyman an avatar for our collective paranoia. He also has good chemistry with Yoo and Roemer. In many respects Disturbia resembles an episode of the old childrens TV series Goosebumps where the chills are kept to acceptable family levels. The difference here is that Caruso really ratchets up the horror in the final reel to the point where the movie cant be recommended for the very young or the very skittish.Disturbia might also have the distinction of being the first movie to use YouTube as part of the plot. It surely wont be the last just as it wont be the last to find Alfred Hitchcock as an endless source of inspiration.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Shia LaBeouf Carrie-Anne Moss Sarah Roemer and Aaron Yoo. Directed by D.J. Caruso. (PG-13. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Disturbia"" is ""Rear Window"" transported to a suburban house with lots of windows to peer out of. Well if youre going to appropriate a plotline better it be a classic instead of the stupid kind. Although the filmmakers havent improved on Hitchcock theyve made some imaginative changes -- the Jimmy Stewart character is a teenager named Kale -- and produced an eminently watchable thriller with built-in appeal to teens. The pleasure of ""Disturbia"" is in the leisurely way it unfolds instead of immediately slamming audiences with mayhem and flashes of humor when theyre least expected. An opening scene of Kale fishing with his dad is smart in two ways. It establishes that Kale (Shia LaBeouf fast becoming the best young actor in Hollywood) is funny and likable -- someone you wont mind being cooped up with for the rest of the movie. And the idyllic setting of river and mountains offers a sharp contrast to the claustrophobic feel of everything that follows. Kale winds up under house arrest for socking his teacher. An electronic devise chained to his ankle makes it impossible for him to venture further than 100 feet outside without summoning the police. Like Stewart Kale becomes a voyeur out of boredom spying on his neighbors through binoculars. His street gives the lie to the notion that nothing ever happens in suburbia or as Kale puts it to his buddy Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) escorting him from window to window ""this is reality without the TV."" When one neighbor leaves to play tennis her husband returns home for illicit sex with the help. Young boys gleefully watch pornography in their bedroom out of sight of Mom. Kale becomes enamored with the new girl-next-door Ashley (Sarah Roemer) before they meet by observing her exercise and come out of the pool in a bikini. Anyone familiar with ""Rear Window"" wont be surprised when he spots something fishy another new neighbor (so much for the suburbs offering stability) carting large odd shaped bags into his garage. A tad too coincidentally Kale hears news on TV of a serial killer in the area seen in a vintage blue Mustang just like this guys. As expected Kale is on the case teaming up with Ronnie and Ashley sort of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. Director D.J. Caruso (""Two for the Money"") manages to make their amateur sleuthing seem fresh through the trios use of cell phones vidcams and laptops all of which have become a way of life for teens. When movies incorporate digital paraphernalia it can feel stuck on. But because young people have grown up with this stuff it seems perfectly natural that Ashley would video the suspect buying a shovel (couldnt somebody have thought of a less obvious purchase?) and send the images directly to Kales computer. Called upon to break into the Mustang Ronnie uses knowledge acquired on the Internet. Kale has surveillance equipment thats light-years away from lowly binoculars. While screenwriters Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth wisely dont dwell on it theyre clearly implying that the technology is there to enable anyone to spy on anyone. Their script takes the time to develop characters and a pitch-perfect cast brings them to life. LaBeoufs face and demeanor capture a change in Kale precipitated by a family tragedy. As his mother Carrie-Anne Moss telegraphs love and concern. Yoo makes a perfect comic foil bringing laughs to break up the tension. Roemer a relative newcomer takes a role that could have been mere window dressing and brings it surprising depth particularly in a romantic scene opposite LaBeouf. The main flaw is that it appears obvious where ""Disturbia"" is heading even if you havent seen ""Rear Window."" But Caruso a very visual director serves up some surprises and scares and hes paced his movie briskly. Youre out of this disturbing suburbia before you know it shaken and even stirred. -- Advisory Disturbing images.

With Shia LaBeouf David Morse. Directed by D.J. Caruso (144). PG-13 Scary images violence mild sexuality. At area theaters. Does the world really need an updated adolescent version of ""Rear Window""? Actually it just might. Dont get me wrong ""Disturbia"" director D.J. Caruso is no Alfred Hitchcock. But his teenage take on Hitchs voyeuristic thriller isnt half bad. At the very least itll serve as training wheels before younger film fans move on to the serious stuff. More John Cusack than Jimmy Stewart Shia LaBeouf plays Kale a smart suburban kid whose perfect life ends when his father is killed in a car crash. After acting out a few too many times Kale is sentenced to house arrest with nothing more to do than stare out his window. At first he considers this an excellent use of his time given the fact that his new neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) spends most of her day sunbathing in a barely-there bikini. But when he moves his binoculars just a little to the left he sees something less appealing Cranky Mr. Turner (David Morse) it appears is murdering women in his upstairs bedroom. Theres only so much Kale can do what with the ankle bracelet and all so he persuades his friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) to sneak into Turners house and look around. Naturally a teenage spy has nothing on a professional killer and before long Turner is not only threatening all three kids but ominously asking Kales mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) out on dates. This it goes without saying is not the kind of guy you want for a stepdad. LaBeouf and Morse hold our interest for most of the movie as does a script that amusingly exploits anything likely to be lying around a boys bedroom from high-tech toys to Twinkies. The story starts to fall apart only toward the end when lightning rumbles overhead and our suddenly dense hero decides to explore dark corners on his own. But what ""Disturbia"" lacks in complexity it makes up for in witty jokes sneaky jolts and a timeless lesson If youve got windows someones always watching. elyzawaol.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

David Morse and Carrie-Anne Moss star in Disturbia. Photo Paramount Pictures Disturbia 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Disturbia is not shoddily made and its not badly acted. But every 15 minutes I wanted to jump from my seat and holler ""Call the police you birdbrain"" Or some colorful variation thereof. Its the kind of movie in which the good guys have a pretty solid idea of what the bad guy is up to and the bad guy has a pretty solid idea of what the good guys are up to but the good guys continue to spy on the bad guy -- with the help of cutting-edge surveillance gizmos -- until the bad guy gets sick and tired of being stalked. Then he issues vaguely freakish threats in a dimly lit parking garage. Even so no one calls the police. Why not? The short answer is Duh because then there wouldnt be a movie. The long answer is Because it is much much easier to goose the audience with titillating suburban-voyeur scenarios than it is to craft a suspense yarn in a realistic dramatic context. My main gripe is that the filmmakers -- director D.J. Caruso who put the macho mojo in Two for the Money and screenwriters Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth -- made no effort to drum up some semilogical explanation for not bringing in the law. As in I dont know -- the cat ate my cell phone? Maybe lightning storms downed every power line in 80 miles. Or the entire police department ate tainted escargot. It could happen. The hero even has a direct line to 911 being holed up on house arrest with a GPS-enabled cuff around his ankle All he has to do is stick his foot through the hedge and the cops are so there. Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is in a rough patch a large rough patch and it has nothing to do with being named for a leafy green vegetable. His dad was killed in a car crash; a year later he slugged his Spanish teacher in the face. Hence the house arrest. Hence the bored teens descent into round-the-clock idleness which he combats by drinking Red Bull and gluing stacks of Twinkies into an obelisk. He also takes up eavesdropping as a less than constructive hobby turning his binoculars on a sphinx-eyed beauty named Ashley (Sarah Roemer The Grudge 2); a trio of grammar-school reprobates; a philandering husband; and a punctilious lawn-mowing neighbor (David Morse always believable as saint or psychopath). ""This is reality without the TV"" he raves to pal Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) but when Lawn-mower Man pulls up in a blue 1960s Ford Mustang with a dented fender Kale pauses. Hmmm wasnt there something on the news about an identical car being spotted near the scene of a kidnapping? Now would be the time to call the cops. Instead Kale and Ronnie and new friend Ashley begin their serial-killer stakeout ceding nothing to common sense or good citizenship -- even when the bad guy brings home a dishy-looking redhead with ""dead meat"" written all over her. Despite this foolishness and despite the patent knockoffs of Rear Window and American Beauty (the gold standard for sympathetic adolescent snoops) Disturbia is a likable little thriller. LaBeouf carries it nimbly on his slim frame working those puppy-dog eyes into pie plates of terror or self-deprecatory charm. I appreciated the movies comic feints its (comparatively) low body count and (relative) lack of graphic violence -- at least until the final reel or two.

Remaking ""Rear Window"" the incomparable Hitchcock drama combining drum-tight action plotting with caustic commentary about American voyeurism? Dont even try. Casting Shia LaBeouf who seems challenged trying to shake off the TV mannerisms he learned on the Disney channel? A formula for mediocrity. Yet another assault on the alleged weirdness of suburban life? That grew tired long before ""American Beauty."" But ""Disturbia"" is a pretty terrific movie full of chills and laughs and innovative uses of new technology. This worthy film openly honors Hitchcocks work in ""Rear Window"" without merely ripping it off - kind of like a bold director updating a Shakespeare play in a contemporary setting. Done well it works. To the aging filmgoer then - myself included - what a relief. To the lucky clueless teen what a double treat. First they can enjoy ""Disturbia"" and later discover the joys of Hitchcocks original eternally graced by Grace Kelly. ""Disturbia"" opens with majesty portent and brute force. LaBeouf is good son Kale fly-fishing in the mountains with his father (Matt Craven). ""You did everything you could"" dad tells Kale upon losing a fish. ""Sometimes they just get away."" File that for later. A horrendous car crash kills dad; the scene is jarring yet somehow restrained. Kale is devastated and back at school he slugs a teacher for crassly bringing up his fathers name. So its home detention for Kale with an ankle bracelet. Luckily for Kale a pretty girl moves in next door (Sarah Roemer doing her best in the impossible task of imitating Grace Kelly). And there might be a psycho living on the other side - David Morse usually so somber here turning up the charm in an appropriately unctuous way. LaBeouf sheds the overacted TV tics that marred earlier performances and is convincing as a Jimmy Stewart-style Everyteen. Hes a slob but goodhearted horny but decent depressed but hopeful. We laugh at some of the antics and wonder if thats appropriate given how dark things might turn. But then ""Rear Window"" sported an arch humor as well and Hitchcock knew how to amuse as well as terrify. The writing can be sharp. ""Look Kale Im sorry youre a felon but this is not a vacation"" says an exasperated mom played by the always welcome Carrie-Anne Moss. ""Im not a stalker"" says Kale putting down his binoculars for a moment. ""These are just side effects of chronic boredom."" Director D.J. Caruso (episodes of ""The Shield"" and the film ""Salton Sea"") and writer Christopher Landon update the 1950s technology of ""Rear Window"" without turning Kale and his friends into hopeless geeks. Kales ankle-based detention allows him to go outside but only to a line at the edge of the lawn a physical distance exploited nicely on the set. (The same soundstage as ""Rear Window"" appropriately.) The teens are perfectly comfortable with webcams digital video call forwarding and caller I.D. - all of which may come in handy for the resident serial killer as well. Trying to break into a car for evidence Kales friend says ""This is a lot harder than it looks on the Internet."" The electronic tools give a punch line feel to another observation ""Think about that Why does he want his privacy?"" Demanding privacy means having something to hide. Hmmm. ""Disturbia"" goes too far for its climax going all ""Silence of the Bichon Frise"" and offering one too many shrink-wrapped bodies. But the teenagers I took were enthralled and checked behind their doors when they went to bed that night always the sign of an effective movie. ""Disturbia"" will have young people on the edge of their seat cringing and thinking at the same time. Thank you Alfred and thank you to a new generation of respectful filmmakers.

"Imitation but not flattery - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Imitation but not flattery By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  April 13 2007 Theres probably a way to do ""Rear Window "" as a seen-it-all thriller about a 17-year-old under house arrest but ""Disturbia "" isnt it. The movie disdains the mounting suspense of Hitchcocks movie. The nominal thrills hit our heads like Acme anvils.After his father dies Kale (Shia LaBeouf ) fills with the usual movie anomie. An assault on his Spanish teacher wins him three months in an electronic ankle bracelet that keeps him within 100 feet of the enviable San Fernando Valley home his mother (Carrie-Anne Moss ) maintains. Out of boredom he starts watching the neighbors first with his naked eye then through a pair of binoculars then with his camcorder the wife having the affair the pre-teen boys watching porn but especially the comely teenage blonde next door (her family just moved in; its that kind of movie) and the lumbering gentleman one house over.Kale wastes no time concluding that his female neighbor -- Ashley (Sarah Roemer ) -- is hot and that his male neighbor -- Mr. Turner (David Morse ) -- is sinister. And the movie wastes no time showing us how right he is. A topless swimmer Ashley doesnt simply disrobe for the camera -- Kales? the movies? -- she friskily peels her clothes off. And Mr. Turner? He just looks up to something. Morse isnt even trying for subtlety (though that tiny hoop earring is a nice silly touch). He shows up in every scene with a glint of ax murderer in his eyes.This year has already brought us one superb voyeurism drama in ""The Lives of Others "" which in part was about how watching strangers can make us invisible to ourselves. It seems stupid to subject ""Disturbia"" to any such comparison. The notion of a boy whose life becomes one of increasingly urgent surveillance seems ripe for a moment when public trust is harder to come by. But the movie doesnt want to be smart. It wants to be a hit. And under the circumstances the two appear to be mutually exclusive.The filmmakers (D.J. Caruso directed Carl Ellsworth and Christopher B. Landon wrote the screenplay) dont bother with character surprises or narrative trap doors. That said the sequence in which Kale dispatches his antic buddy Ronnie (Aaron Yoo ) to poke around Mr. Turners garage armed with a video camera culminates in a funny mini-satire of Asian horror.Otherwise the movie just punches its way toward the dumb violent finale (alas another killer whod rather prattle on than murder his victims; Morse is playing a talky version of Michael Myers from the ""Halloween "" movies). Every piece of the story is jammed predictably into place. Kale sees the cute girl next door; the cute girl comes over. Kale sees the killer next door; the killer comes over.""Rear Window"" never comes up in the ""Disturbia"" press notes which is probably just as well since it steals that movies premise but none of Alfred Hitchcocks wit finesse or seduction. The new movies similarities seem more actionable than affectionate. Roemer is summer-fling sexy in the Grace Kelly part. And Yoo is Thelma Ritter on Red Bull . The aggravating music tries to horn in on the Hitchcock act with a score that apes Bernard Hermanns . (For what its worth Franz Waxman was the ""Rear Window"" composer.)LaBoeuf is rangy and a suitably intense actor capable of a hormonal rage both emotional and sexual. Hes not trying to be Jimmy Stewart which is a relief. But that hes not makes you realize how difficult doing ""Rear Window"" would be in 2007. Hitchcocks movie is 53 years old and it told the story of a kind of burgeoning American disillusionment that were now well past. Weve moved from disillusionment to entitlement. So Kale has the right to be suspicious the way contestants feel they have the right to win ""American Idol ."" And the movie is aligned with him except when it busts up all suspense and leaves his point of view to show us corroborating information he cant witness himself as if to say See? Hes right.Catching a murderer here isnt a moral imperative. Its a self-justification. Indeed ""Disturbia"" ends with a well-placed smooch and a better-placed product but without the faintest acknowledgment of the previous nights horrors. Those were ephemeral. But hormones and soft-drinks are forever.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies visit boston.com/ae/movies/blog. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

Mr. Willis doesnt have to worry so much about choices since hes able to swing between remunerative stinkers like this one and small but interesting roles that balance the schlock. Ms. Berry on the other hand has undermined her once promising career with a consistency thats come to resemble perverse purpose. ENLARGE Her latest role is Rowena an unprincipled investigative journalist for a disreputable rag called the New York Courier. The plot plucked from Hollywoods recycle bin by Todd Komarnicki and Jon Bokenkamp is prodded into sluggish action when one of Rowenas childhood friends turns up dead -- not just no longer among the living but murdered in a way that provides a grisly sequence in the morgue. We get the dubious privilege of meeting the victim Grace shortly before she meets her fate and she is one deeply dislikable dame. To the degree that our involvement in the film depends on our distress at her demise all is lost in the first few minutes. (Its lost again in the last few minutes of a surprise ending.) Yet Grace is no more dislikable than anyone else on screen. Mr. Williss advertising mogul Harrison Hill is smirkily insufferable and not only because theres reason to think he had Grace killed. Rowenas research assistant Miles (Giovanni Ribisi) has all the earmarks of a psycho killer; his manifest character flaws are punched up further by creepy lighting. What a team Ro and Miles turn out to be. To get the goods on Hill she acquires a new name a new identity and above all new clothes then gets herself hired as a temp at his ad agency. (Ro also types seductive nothings to her boss during interminable chats on the Internet which the screenwriters seem to have taken for a brand-new invention.) Meanwhile back at the newspapers city room Miles works away as a happy hacker breaking into every computer system he can find to mine telltale data. Maybe this is how people think reporters operate these days. Still it isnt clear that Ro knows how unprincipled she is or that the Courier knows how disreputable it is for the movie itself has a smarmy tabloid soul. Disturbia ENLARGE Shia LaBeouf as a teen who uncovers a secret in ""Disturbia"" The most disturbious part of ""Disturbia"" is how engaging this teenage thriller manages to be even though its a shameless rip-off of ""Rear Window."" Instead of Jimmy Stewart in a wheelchair we have Shia LaBeouf as Kale a troubled suburban teen under house arrest. The suspense plot resembles Hitchcocks classic -- Kales idle voyeurism suddenly leads him to believe a next-door neighbor may be a serial killer. The specific differences though are both silly and felicitous. The silly part which will sell the picture involves Kales emergence as the Inspector Gadget of junior detectives. The kid presses into surveillance service every gizmo known to kiddom -- computer digital camera camcorder cellphone iPod. The felicitous part involves the young star himself -- Shia LaBeoufs widely touted appeal justifies the touts -- and his co-star Sarah Roemer who plays Ashley the girl next door. No gadgetry is needed when theyre together at quiet moments coming of age with timeless tenderness. The TV Set Most horror films these days are haplessly synthetic but ""The TV Set"" is the real deal -- smart funny and authentically terrifying. Its a comedy that explains how network television succeeds in being so horribly awful. ENLARGE In ""The TV Set"" Sigourney Weaver plays a TV network chief. The writer-director Jake Kasdan has directed a number of TV shows including the pilot for and several episodes of the well-received but prematurely dispatched ""Freaks and Geeks."" For this smallish-scale feature film -- the running time is 84 minutes -- he has chosen to tell his hilariously baleful tale in a microcosm one thats inhabited mostly by pod people with microspirits. ""The TV Set"" tracks the evolution of a single pilot ""The Wexler Chronicles"" during pilot season at the fictional Panda Network. (Did someone say ""pander""?). The network is run by Lenny (Sigourney Weaver triumphant) a woman who suffers from acid reflux while those around her suffer from flux. Nothing that she touches ever stays the same because she has no emotional artistic intellectual or moral moorings. Lenny is connected to the real world only by ratings which is why a near-death experience on a plane has strengthened her religious belief that ""theres no reason we cant win Thursday night."" David Duchovny plays Mike Klein the borderline-mournful creator of the pilot. Mike hopes to put his personal stamp on the series a dramedy inspired by his brothers suicide. But suicide is a downer the concept tests badly and personal stamps are what TV writers use to mail personal letters. By the time ""The Wexler Chronicles"" gets picked up for a first season it has been transformed for the worse in almost every imaginable way and not only at Lennys devious insistence. The show has suffered the thousand cuts of the network process a crazy actor a craven director a hostile cinematographer a bifocal focus group asked to choose between two radically different tellings of Mikes tale his version and the networks version. ENLARGE David Duchovny as the creator of the television show thats at the center of The TV Set. ""The TV Set"" isnt in the same league with ""Network"" or ""The Player"" but its very good and its cast is accomplished. I particularly liked Judy Greer as Alice Mikes manager a bright young woman who bends the truth with blithe abandon. Alice comes up blank when Mike makes a reference to ""Taxi Driver"" then admits that shes never seen it and promises with pretend contrition to check it out. You know she never will.    DVD TIP Shia LaBeouf shines in another coming-of-age story Dito Montiels autobiographical debut feature ""A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints"" (2006). He plays the young Dito a kid yearning to flee the mean streets of his Astoria Queens neighborhood in the 1980s. The cast includes Chazz Palminteri Dianne Wiest and as Dito in his manhood Robert Downey Jr. Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Carusos new flick is a better-than-average teen pic crossed with a clunkier-than-average thriller. By Peter Ranier Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor April 13 2007 Save for later Saved It was only a question of time before Hollywood came up with the idea of doing Hitchcocks ""Rear Window"" for the YouTube generation. ""Disturbia"" is a better-than-average teen pic crossed with a clunkier-than-average thriller.Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is a gangly obstreperous teenager whose father was recently killed in a car crash. Traumatized by the accident he believes himself partly responsible for he punches out a high school teacher for alluding to the incident and is sentenced to house arrest for three months. If he moves beyond the 100-foot perimeter of his suburban Craftsman-style home his ankle bracelet will alert the cops and his next stop will be prison.Since Kale is not a bad kid at heart we can easily sympathize with his accelerating boredom. At first until his mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) cuts off the juice he enjoys surfing the Web and playing video games. He gorges on peanut butter and chocolate syrup and builds towers made of Twinkies. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? If Kale was more of a reader say his incarceration might have been a blessing. Hes not dumb by any means but hes too keyed up to use his time ""productively."" Hes an extrovert trapped in an introverts lifestyle. Until that is he begins spying on his neighbors. It starts innocently enough. Through one window he logs the progress of the local philanderers; through another he stakes out Ashley (Sarah Roemer) a teen beauty who has recently moved next door; through the window of his fathers office he checks out Mr. Turner (David Morse) who keeps to himself and who Kale begins to suspect is a serial killer. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Director D.J. Caruso and his screenwriters Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth are at their best in conveying Kales increasingly loopy suspicions - which of course come to seem increasingly plausible. With help from Ashley and from Kales best friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) he becomes a first-class amateur sleuth. In ""Rear Window"" all Jimmy Stewart had to work with was a telescope and binoculars but Kale and his cohorts have all sorts of computer imaging gizmos at their disposal. In the new high-tech world of voyeurism even teenagers can easily become expert operatives.The suburban setting reinforces the storys anything-is-plausible conceit. ""Rear Window"" was set in the city so it was no surprise that a killer would be housed there. In popular mythology the city is home base for the depraved; the suburbs are where you flee to safety. The filmmakers of ""Disturbia"" turn that well-worn mythology on its head. They bring out the creepiness in the suburban experience. All that calm becomes unsettling.In the Spielberg 1970s epitomized by such movies as ""E.T."" the suburbs had an all-American patina. Inside those cookie-cutter lookalike homes lived pipsqueak dreamers yearning for transcendence. ""Disturbia"" has a cast of young actors who in the 1970s might have fitted nicely into one of Spielbergs visionary vaudevilles. In another vein they might have slotted into the voyeuristic landscape of the Brian De Palma who made ""Dressed to Kill"" or ""Blow Out.""In the current era though they are more like postmodern versions of the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. Although Caruso doesnt provide them with enough brainy problems to solve they still come across as tremendously industrious and likable. They know that for all its dangers they are living out a teen fantasy Spying on adults in order to get the goods on them.The bloody wrap-up isnt handled especially well and I must confess that the most shocking thing about the movie was the casting of Carrie-Anne Moss as a suburban mom. I kept expecting her ""Matrix"" skills to show up in the final reel. But no the kids go it alone. And they do just fine. Grade B Rated PG-13 on appeal for sequences of terror and violence and some sensuality.

Caruso and screenwriters Christopher B. Landon and Carl Ellsworth have made their protagonist housebound not because of a broken leg but because of the gizmo strapped to his leg After surviving a horrendous car accident that kills his father high schooler Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) becomes an emotional wreck and slugs one of his teachers. Sentenced to house arrest Kale has to wear an electronic ankle bracelet - if he leaves the parameters of his home an alarm goes off and the police come.So Kale passes his time playing video games scarfing (and sculpting) junk food scanning the neighborhood through binoculars a married guy getting it on with his maid some little kids sneaking cable porn the dishy teenage daughter of a couple just moved in from the city and a guy with a vintage Ford Mustang that matches the description of a vintage Ford Mustang spotted when a young woman was abducted.The woman is missing and presumed dead.And so Kale aided by his goof-off pal Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and that beautiful new neighbor Ashley (Sarah Roemer) start sleuthing around deploying cell phones laptops and videocams to determine whether the creepy Mustang owner Mr. Turner (Philadelphias own David Morse once again playing the nut job) has an inventory of body bags in his garage.Caruso orchestrates all this in swift efficient strokes mixing the jolts with some jokes and building measurable suspense with a minimum of blood and gore. LaBeouf projects an intelligence and an Everyguy attitude thats remindful of a younger John Cusack while Roemer has a younger Gwyneth Paltrow thing going if Gwyneth Paltrow had been a cast member of The O.C.Disturbia like a lot of high-concept thrillers lets a few balls drop as the climax comes around Kales mom played by Carrie-Ann Moss does some truly dopey things Roemers character virtually disappears from view at an especially vital moment and audience members will be yelling ""Call for backup"" at the guy playing Officer Gutierrez (Jose Pablo Cantillo).But at a certain point movies like Disturbia require suspension of belief. To its credit that moment comes much later in the game than usual. Up until then like Rear Window before it Disturbia is sly and suspenseful and full of mounting dread.Disturbia  (out of four stars) Directed by D.J. Caruso written by Christopher B.

"Disturbia | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; disturbia ) Disturbia (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Disturbia is a nice little mystery thriller that takes a wrong turn on the way to its climax and morphs into a slasher movie. This abrupt change in tone is as jarring as it is unwelcome and transforms what could have been an effectively tense conclusion into something so over-the-top that its almost laughable. During its best moments Disturbia doesnt have the material to be memorable but it is watchable and the subject matter holds an undeniable fascination. But the filmmakers belief that modern audiences will only respond to noisy inarticulate endings dooms this movie to a last act that devalues rather than elevates it. Anyone with a rudimentary sense of film history will recognize this as a re-imagination of Rear Window even if the final twenty minutes owes more to Friday the 13th than the Hitchcock classic. The essential premise has lost none of its ability to compel how a person trapped in his house can fill the hollowness of his existence by voyeuristically experiencing the lives of others. The dramas that unfold through the windows of neighbors become real-life soap operas with plenty of sex nudity and - unfortunately - violence. One obvious difference is that Rear Window featured James Stewart Grace Kelly and Raymond Burr. Disturbia stars Shia LaBeouf Sarah Roemer and David Morse. With all due respect to these actors theyre not in the same pantheon and they dont come close to evidencing the same screen presence. LaBeouf doesnt feel right for the part and he fails to convey the kind of desperation that would escalate the suspense to an unbearable level. Roemer is pretty enough but doesnt show much in the way of acting ability. And Morse is in full bad-ass mode. We know from the first minute we see him that hes a creep not just some misunderstood lonely guy. Carrie-Anne Moss appears in the throw-away part of the mother and Aaron Yoo plays one of the years most annoying sidekicks. He singlehandedly ruins nearly every scene in which he appears. After a quiet little prologue featuring Kale (LaBeouf) and his father fishing were thrust into the story via a disturbing car crash. I will give director D.J. Caruso credit for making this one of the most visceral automobile accidents to reach the screen in some time. This is more unsettling than anything that comes after. A year later Kale is a sullen and uncommunicative student who goes before a judge after punching his Spanish teacher. He is given a sentence of house arrest three months during which he must wear an ankle bracelet that defines his world as being within 100 feet of the signal box. After his mother cancels his X-Box online subscription Kale has nothing to do but stare out his bedroom window. Through it he sees a neighbor having an affair with his maid; kids sneaking peeks at a porn channel when their mom isnt looking; Ashley (Roemer) the sexy new girl next door undressing with her blinds open; and the strange Mr. Turner (Morse) whose car looks exactly like one reportedly used in a recent kidnapping doing nefarious things. Soon Kale has lured Ashley into his room and convinced her that Turner is up to no good. They begin to monitor his activities but Turner is no dummy and he knows hes being watched. While Disturbia borrows from Rear Window its not a straight remake. Ultimately Caruso is less interested in building tension than he is in spraying the screen with blood gore and shocks. Theres also little ambiguity about Turners innocence or guilt. Morses approach to the role is to let us know from the beginning that his character is a cold-blooded killer and turn the film into a battle of wits between Turner and Kale. In the end its not much of a struggle as both of them turn out to be less-than-formidable adversaries. A comparison between Caruso and Hitchcock is obviously unfair - one is among the pantheon of film deities while the other has a few middling titles on his resume but thats what happens when a director works in Rear Window territory. Disturbia is not a terrible movie. Even with the sordid ending it holds the viewers interest the way any competently made thriller can. Theres a sense of potential squandered but maybe it takes a dumbed-down amped-up approach to capture the attention of todays viewers. Give me Rear Window; Disturbia is like watching a similar story through a glass darkly. Disturbia (United States 2007) Director D. J.

No Urine Grindhouse is great. Too bad it cant be seen in its natural habitat. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Andrew Cooper/Courtesy of the Weinstein Company) At three hours and change boasting two rowdy full-length features a slew of garish fake coming attractions and steady eruptions of carnage and cruelty the Quentin TarantinoRobert Rodriguez collaboration Grindhouse is an ode to the era of exploitation houses and an orgy for those who want to live (or relive) the dream. Its a real Travis Bickle night outa switchback journey into the belly of the B-movie beast. First Rodriguez serves up a zombie-infection shoot-em-up splatterfest called Planet Terror which plays like a bunch of other horror movies stitched together by a sloppy but high-spirited mad scientist. Then comes Tarantinos Death Proof a more intimate and much more disturbing brew. All thats missing are the scary bathrooms and pungent aromas of urine and dope. Rodriguez has learned a few moves since his last big Tarantino collaboration the rhythmless vampire farrago From Dusk Till Dawn. In this Tex-Mex bouillabaisse he has a luscious object in Rose McGowan who opens Planet Terror with a lissome semi-naked pole dance and then sinks to the stage in tears What a soulful actress what a bod. Rodriguezs camera drinks in her pink face with its dimpled chin and pillowy red lips then hugs her long stems in her short vinyl skirt and go-go boots. There it is folksthe story in pictures of why he left his wife and kids for her. When rampaging zombies rip off one of those gams and the hot-rod hero (Freddy Rodriguez) screws a submachine gun into her stump McGowan edges out Uma Thurman in Kill Bill as the ultimate abused-and-fetishized action-movie femme. The other heroine is mangled and fetishized tooMarley Shelton (the doomed beauty in the overture to Rodriguezs Sin City) as a skinny blonde lesbian doctor with a set of syringes tucked into her garter. Its always a trip to watch exploitation auteurs ogle their female characters while those ladies are busy nailing male voyeurs. BACKSTORY During Times Squares porno glory days grindhouse theaters lined the blocks around 42nd Street. But they started disappearing in the late eighties after Mayor Koch shut many down during late-night raids. Giuliani completed their eradication. The one lone grindhouse left within city limits according to the Post (which should know of what it speaks) is the Fair Theatre in East Elmhurst which opened on the heels of the 1939 Worlds Fair. It can hold 599 people and is said to have separate boothsno extra costat which patrons can privately enjoy well whatever it is they came for. Malignant machismo is embodied by Bruce Willis as an infected commando whose face begins to bubble when he stops breathing the (short-term) antidote. (I wont reveal the source of the contagionbut it has a nice resonant political tang.) Before long the maimed and the festering converge on an Austin barbecue joint where most of the ensemble is shot blown up or dismembered. This isnt your usual exploding-blood-squib splatter by the way; think exploding water balloons. In Planet Terrors brief but tumultuous running time Rodriguez pays homage to a long line of directors from Howard Hawks to George Romero to John Carpenter to his bad-boy buddy Tarantinowho shows up as an actor in his favorite kind of role a sexual sadist who gets a gory comeuppance. Which brings us to Death Proof in which the murders are more shocking insofar as the characters are viewed as something other than receptacles of blood and pus. What makes some critics knee-jerk derision of Tarantino so vexing is that hes more than a violence peddler. Hes a predatory humanist. He loves just to hang out with his soon-to-be-beleaguered characters in this case two sets of women. The first threea celebrity Austin D.J. known as Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) and her friends Shanna (Jordan Ladd) and Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito)are chafing under their roles as women of color and objects of lust. (Of course they do stretch out in short shorts for our delectation.) In a local bar and chili parlor a pair of geeks (director Eli Roth and Omar Doom) plot ways to get the women drunk and into bed. But theyre lightweights beside the scarred macho man (Kurt Russell) at the bar who calls himself Stuntman Mike does John Wayne imitations and drives a black Charger he boasts is reinforced for high-speed collisions and rollovers deathproof. The scene in the bar goes on and on to the point where you wonder just what the point is although Rose McGowan is delightful in an entirely different role a blonde hippie chick and as Tarantinos camera arcs around the room the dread becomes increasingly hard to dispel. The second set of women show up before weve fully digested the fate of the first group. But these are ladies of a different stripe fresh from a movie shoot a makeup person (Rosario Dawson) an actress in a flouncy cheerleader uniform (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and most significantly a pair of stuntwomen (Zoe Bell and Tracie Thoms) who gush about vintage speedsters and car movies like Vanishing Point and Dirty Mary Crazy Larry macho girls behaving badly. Its the other side of the grindhouse from Russ Meyers boobalicious kickboxers to Pam Griers foxy vigilantes. Chicks you mess with at your peril. Death Proof like all of Tarantinos work exists in a strange space between homage and masturbation. Its a grim stalker picture a car-chase picture and a raucous anthem to female empowerment. Its also a small masterpiece dredged up from the psyche of a movie freak who loves women onscreen almost as much as he loves to punish women onscreen and who (this is what makes him an artist) gets off most on his own ambivalence. 1 2 3 Next Share this story...

Voyeurism goes high-tech in ""Disturbia"" a modest but squirmingly fun suspenser that brings Alfred Hitchcocks ""Rear Window"" into the era of vidcams and cell phones serving up hearty youth-skewing portions of PG-13 violence and bikini-bait along the way. Not unlike its engaging star Shia LaBeouf here playing a house-bound teen who takes on a dangerous new hobby this nifty little thriller is an irreverent whipper-snapper of a movie always staying a few IQ points ahead of the competition. Set to open April 13 the Paramount release should find willing peepers on bigscreens small screens and laptop/iPod screens before long. OK so LaBeouf isnt exactly Jimmy Stewart. (And Sarah Roemer with her habit of doing yoga in tube tops is more Miss Torso than Grace Kelly.) But as plotted out by scribes Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth ""Disturbia"" is frequently clever and sometimes downright inspired as it updates Hitchcocks 1954 masterpiece for a uniquely paranoid present. One year after his father was killed in a car accident troubled teen Kale (LaBeouf) is sentenced to three months house arrest for punching out his Spanish teacher. When his firm but loving mother (Carrie-Anne Moss) also cuts off his access to videogames and iTunes Kale begins spying intently on his neighbors -- eyeing with particular interest Ashley (Roemer) a willowy young beauty (and avid swimmer) who just moved in next door. Through his binoculars Kale starts noticing some suspicious behavior from creepy older neighbor Robert Turner (David Morse) -- a bloodstained fender here a lady-friend in distress there -- and lets his imagination run wild egged on by news reports of a serial killer on the loose. Best bud Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and Ashley soon find themselves similarly engrossed in Kales game though theyre not always so willing to accept his wildly implausible conclusions. One of the chief pleasures of ""Disturbia"" is the way helmer D.J. Caruso combines old-fashioned suspense techniques with newfangled techno-savvy. Grainy Camcorder footage is exploited to particularly nerve-shredding effect An ingenious extended sequence in which Ronnie breaks into Turners house while Kale monitors the action via live digital feed is unnerving precisely because of what it doesnt show the viewer. Ellsworths previous script for the Wes Craven-directed ""Red Eye"" proved similarly resourceful at wringing thrills and chills from a small-scaled intensely claustrophobic scenario. Though less stagebound ""Disturbia"" shows both integrity and formidable genre smarts ratcheting up tension and raising pitch-black chuckles while for the most part remaining as shackled to the protags house as he is. (Kales metal ankle-bracelet which alerts the police if he ventures outside his front yard is an especially instrumental plot point.) Playing a character whos frequently foolish impulsive and unsympathetic LaBeouf relies on his sharp wit and sense of mischief to keep the viewer on his side; hes well matched by the hilarious Yoo who shows great stoner-comedy potential. And while she disappears for long stretches at a time Moss wearily conveys a fierce bond with her son that adds an emotional dimension to the pics conventional slasher-movie finale. Although he doesnt invite sympathy for the devil the way Raymond Burr did in ""Rear Window"" Morse makes a seriously creepy (if fairly unambiguous) bad guy with his towering 64 frame and dangerously soft sickly-sweet voice. Absent any Hitchcockian layers of viewer implication (here ogling is a guilt-free pleasure) ""Disturbia"" shouldnt be mistaken for much more than a teen movie par excellence. But itd also be wrong to assume it has nothing on its mind. Pointedly relocated from ""Rear Windows"" Greenwich Village apartments to Anytown USA pic has slyly resonant things to say about both suburban paranoia (as implied by its generic title) and young Gen-Yers with too much technology on their hands. Prologue which contains not one but two of the most sickeningly choreographed car crashes in recent movie memory effectively sets up Kales predicament but could be excised with no harm to the final product. Exterior locations rep a canny mix of Southern California suburbs. Jim Pages editing is razor-sharp while the tense Bernard Herrmann-esque strings of Geoff Zanellis score are suitably sexed up with thuddingly percussive beats and a smattering of rock tunes.
