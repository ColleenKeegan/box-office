Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Lenika Cruz Jul 13 2015 Culture Each summer brings a smattering of scary movies to ostensibly break up the monotony of blockbusters and super-hero sequels but rarely are they immune to their own brand of sameness. The Gallows is the latest to blandly combine low-budget horror with a found-footage approach in hopes of selling the fading novelty to the uninitiated to die-hard horror fans or to unsuspecting viewers looking for a break from the usual box-office fare.Related Story Insidious Chapter 3 Is All Jumps No Real Scares The films title ostensibly comes from the name of a high-school play staged 20 years ago that ended with one of the actors being killed in a freak onstage accident Instead of being hanged accidentally the gallows noose contraption failed and the student (Charles Grimille) died for real. To honor his memory the school decides to resurrect the play. A few students decide to sabotage the production by sneaking into the theater at night to destroy the set but they get mysteriously locked in by a disturbed spirit and an evening of creepy hallways spooky sounds frantic yelling and blurry shadows ensues.The four main actors play characters with their same first names supposedly as a way to ground the film in realism. But they instead come off as facsimiles of teenagers and hew precisely to type while remaining a few degrees removed from plausible. The jock Ryan is a childish obnoxious jerk; the jocks girlfriend Cassidy is a pretty down-for-whatever cheerleader; Ryans jock friend Reese is taking an irritating amount of heat for liking a supposedly-unpretty-but-actually-pretty ""drama geek"" named Pfeifer. All four make for largely uninteresting guides through a night of terror even while they do a decent job of selling their fear to the camera.The very basic premise of teenagers getting locked in a bleak school at night is creepy enough. (Though theres probably a better horror story to be found in the dismal conditions of the public schools visibly underfunded facilities the outdated phone system The grimy locker rooms) And to an extent the long stretches of silence with the camera light being swallowed up by an underground corridor are incredibly effective at making viewers involuntarily curl up in their seats with their hands over their eyes. But stitching enough of these kinds of scenes together even with a loose backstory doesnt make for a good scary film.Once you finally see Charlie much of the long-simmering dread the film strives to cultivate evaporates.Nor does it make for an original one. As Geoff Berkshire writing for Variety put it ""One advantage of selling horror movies to teenagers is that theyre less likely to already know all the genre tropes."" So you can see why studios keep attempting them especially low-budget productions People will pay to see them no matter how bad. And so unfortunately for every truly chilling examples of the genre (The Blair Witch Project Paranormal Activity [REC]) there are several sequels imitators and remakes (Paranormal Activity 4 [REC] 3 Genesis Quarantine) that continue to dilute the potential of the format.The Gallows didnt need to reimagine found-footage horror films but it could have at least tried harder to exceed the super-low expectations typically set for such cookie-cutter fare. Among the familiar elements four teenagers who get stuck somewhere with a malevolent mostly invisible force hunting them down. Inexplicably steady-handed camerawork by someone who always conveniently captures well-framed scenes. Forehead-slapping decisions by the group to split up. Close-up shot of a terrified crying girl. Steady supply of loud noises to offer jump scares in lieu of suspense-building music. Creepy photographs. TVs that turn on out of nowhere. Cut phone lines.The problem is that each of these elements doesnt necessarily make for a bad movie--Sometimes horror makes the poor decision to overcompensate for its formulaic nature by becoming too self-referential (see MTVs new series remake of 1996s slasher flick Scream). But the lazy way The Gallows bundles its tropes together suggests that its creators ambitions went no higher than simply getting a horror film made. In a year with upcoming releases such as Sinister 2 and Rings (the latest sequel to The Ring) as well as higher-concept films such as Crimson Peak and Before I Wake The Gallows seems to fall somewhere in between. Not quite ripping off on the successes of an original film but not adding anything remotely memorable to the canon either.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Set on a cursed Nebraska stage The Gallows begins in 1993 when as we see in degraded video footage a wanna-be Brando meets his accidental death via a malfunctioning prop. Two decades later the school somehow decides to put on an anniversary revival because wouldnt that be a good idea. Even before the plots trio of sexy saboteurs--an athlete (Reese Mishler) a princess (Cassidy Gifford) an obnoxious bully with a camera (Ryan Shoos)--gets locked in the building overnight by supernatural forces you know this play isnt going to make it to the curtain call. Writer-directors Chris Lofing and Travis Cluff go straight for found-footage cliches (evil is conveniently signaled by a low hum) without ever bothering to wonder if such found footage mainly of adolescents shrieking in the dark wouldnt be instantly relost. This gimmick needs to be taken out to the Blair Witch woods and retired. Marginally more interesting is the movies resuscitation of the 80s horror trope of the one-named killer Here hes Charlie the ghost of the dead student or maybe hes the hangman. In any case he wears a bag over his head and nooses people to death. After several tedious jump scares and boneheaded escape plans a bag over your head wont seem like such a bad idea. Or the noose.

"Hope/less? Another Failed Shot for Ryan Reynolds; Plus The Gallows Nightmare and Tangerine Dream << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Hope/less? Another Failed Shot for Ryan Reynolds; Plus The Gallows Nightmare and Tangerine Dream Focus Features Movies July 10 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print For everything thats intangible about being a star there are some useful tools we can use to measure whether someone actually is one. Is this person the only one you can imagine in a particular part? And can this person turn a bad stupid or generic movie into a hit? This is just a way of wondering -- once more -- whether Ryan Reynolds will ever be the sort of actor who can lure audiences to something like Self/less while diverting your thoughts from the dozen or so other men and women who could have carried the same body-swap movie. The plot is almost two hours of empty calories built around Reynolds who runs around the middle of the country trying to solve an absurd mystery set into motion when a gravely ill bizarrely accented Manhattan real estate magnate named Damian Hale (Ben Kingsley) spends some of his fortune to move his soul into Reynoldss younger haler body. Meanwhile Damians cadaver will be returned for a funeral -- presumably so his management team and CNBC can pay lugubrious tribute. The company (called Phoenix because all the subtle names were taken) conducting the transfer assures old Damian that this new vessel was lab-raised. And given the fatlessness on display you just go with it. (Albright the young clammy-looking British scientist in charge at Phoenix is played by Matthew Goode who in a suit and glasses seems like hes starring in a different fake chiller Wes Cravens Princeton.) You look at the two fit bodies lying prone on the parallel retractable beds of the soul-transfer machine and notice that the new body doesnt look that new. Once Reynoldss version of Damian is up and about and given a new life and name (Edward) we discover that new Damian is about 35 and graying. We never see the older man participate in the process of engineering a second body. But the minor kick of the movie is that there wasnt one. Before Edward gets to the bottom of why its all fun. Hes set up in a New Orleans manse on the border of Faubourg Marigny and the French Quarter. A brass-and-percussion street band provides a seemingly personal soundtrack for the montage of women falling onto his bed in ecstasy. Old Damian had been sad about never connecting with his droopy adult daughter (Michelle Dockery an actress whose point continues to elude me). Shes rejected his sense of capitalism by running a drab-looking nonprofit which judging from the Costco decor hands out breakfast cereal in bulk. But for now never mind her Theres basketball to play women to seduce and Derek Lukes offer of friendship to accept. But somethings not right. Edward misses a dose of the red pills Phoenix gave him to cut down on side effects which include flashbacks to a life Old Damian never lived. Focus Features Theres no reason to spoil what follows except to say that even by the standards of both Alfred Hitchcock and science fiction its nonsensical. Edward goes to Missouri where an idyllic sci-fi/fantasy Hollywood farmscape awaits along with its owner Maddy a very confused single mother played with tearful intensity by Natalie Martinez (who unfortunately spends the movie relegated in function and attire to ""nanny"" even though the child shes looking after belongs to her character). The script is credited to the Spanish brothers Alex and David Pastor and the director is Tarsem Singh working a more flavorless angle than hes probably used to. Gone is the nutso visual maximalism of The Cell and Immortals and the layered self-amusement of Julia Roberts in Mirror Mirror. The closest to baroque that things get here is Old Damians gilded apartment with its Trumps-eye views of Central Park. Its as if a 24-karat dog pooped on all the surfaces. Singh is in charge of a safer more conventional movie where ""Were looking for an abandoned warehouse"" is an actual line of dialogue. I think the scientific ideas that Ex Machina expressed are embedded in sexual cliches but there are at least ideas to dismiss. For most of Self/less I was sure I was watching the first two episodes of a vapid new cable series. A late twist kicks the film into a moderately higher gear of wit but I spent the whole thing feeling bad for Reynolds who works hard to sell the movie as something other than a composite of everything from Jacobs Ladder and The Fugitive to the Bourne series and Limitless. Hes giving you most of what hes got. You just never sense that you couldnt have gotten the same performance from about eight other men which I imagine is how the role wound up with him. With these action movies and romantic comedies that often feels true of Reynolds Somebody else said no first. Whats fascinating is that hes peaking as a performer. He has lost the glibness and sarcasm that made his physique more of an asset than it probably should have been. In the spring he reached a new casually soulful place as Helen Mirrens reluctant attorney in Woman in Gold. Before that his emotional suppression was the best thing in Atom Egoyans truly embarrassing The Captive. And hes just as good as a seemingly wholesome gambler in Mississippi Grind a casino drama with Ben Mendelsohn that comes out later this year. Reynolds cant do gonzo the way Jake Gyllenhaal thinks he can and Bradley Cooper is now much smoother and more confident in any part he gets. He might never get roles that are going to the Christian Bales and Leonardo DiCaprios of the world. He might actually be better as a second banana the way he is with Mirren and Mendelsohn. In the meantime he can drag slick-enough action movies like this new one over the finish line. But hopefully Reynolds has at least forgotten the title. Its not less self he needs but more.  Warner Bros. Another month another ultimately inadequate found-footage horror movie -- and from the Blumhouse cannery too. But The Gallows has a cleverness that bobs occasionally above the surface of cesspool murk. You cant tell whether its just flotsam or a corpse but for most of the 80-minute run time it almost doesnt matter. Its at least something. The setting is a Nebraska high school production of a play (The Gallows) that according to camcorder footage from 1993 appears to be some kind of puritanical trial drama whose climax is the lynching of the male lead. You can hear the parents of that actor expressing expository marvel at how good he is. But then he steps onto the scaffold and is hanged for real. Decades later the school is restaging the play presumably to complete business that went unfinished. The footage here this time made public by the local police department mostly belongs to the smartphone of a bullying football player named Ryan (Ryan Shoos) who decides to recruit the star of the show and his former teammate Reese (Reese Mishler) to destroy the set because theater is for pussies. Ryans feisty cheerleader girlfriend Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford daughter of Kathie Lee and Frank) invites herself along and eventually the plays earnest female lead Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) turns up too. Theyre all bait for whatever is trying to slip that rope around their necks. The Gallows betters its predecessors by adding a metaphysical presence that conforms to the bogeymen of old -- here its somebody in a leather hood waving a noose. With any of these movies the question for me is always how people manage to hold on to cameras when theyre running crawling or crying for their life. Its a formal crutch that never quite breaks through illogic to get to something like ""societal metaphor."" It just makes the filmmakers -- Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing who wrote and coproduced too -- and the credited director of photography (Edd Lukas) seem desperate. Its also impossible to keep track of the jumps in footage when say someones battery dies. The video leaps fitfully from device to device like a disease in search of a host. And has the police department also performed sleight-of-hand edits and provided the footage its banging whirring slamming wholly insinuating sound design? Theres also the loaded hassle of watching a movie have fun with a symbol of racial threat. The noose persists on campuses and outside homes and churches to terrorize and intimidate. The near-comprehensive whiteness of these Blumhouse movies -- the most recent widget was the partially fascinating Skype-mare slasher film Unfriended from the spring -- poses no problem from film to film. But here you do wonder how a change in the casting strategy might have also altered the nature of the threat. What would adding a black character to this movie in particular have done to reshape the meaning of the bogeyman? The lack of any credible explanation of why whats happening is happening fertilizes an inclination to speculate. No one in the racially mixed audience I saw this with the other night seemed to be doing much speculation. They just went with it -- well as far as something this violently incoherent could take them. There was jumping shrieking and shouting advice at the screen. This is a movie made for the ""dont go in there""-minded. People want the visceral punch not of good horror per se but of any horror. But sometimes with these footage films the bridge to get to horror is laughably rickety. At some point in The Gallows the characters stumble upon a warping video that reexplains the events of 1993 complete with spliced-in news coverage. Found footage is one thing. But youre in trouble when the footage has to find you.  Cre Film In theory The Gallows was shot with phones. But Sean Bakers gangbusters farce Tangerine actually was -- with an iPhone. And that is the least of its many vertiginous selling points.  In part its the story of a Los Angeles transgender prostitute named Sin-Dee Rella (Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) just out of jail and on a mission to find the non-transgender white woman who slept with Sin-Dees man and her best friend Alexandra (Mya Taylor) who attempts to serve as a one-woman bomb squad. In part its the story of an Armenian cab driver named Razmik (Karren Karagulian) cruising the streets for fares. In part its the story of how they all happen to descend upon the same grubby doughnut shop one Christmas Eve night. I wrote about this movie in January from Sundance. Ive seen it again since then and could watch it every week until Bakers next scuzzy acrobatic magnum opus. He has an affection for the urban underbelly and a way with personality- and reaction-based comedy thats hard to do. The indignities insults and vulgarities pile up until they feel monumental. The races ethnicities genders and sexualities all pinball off each other until it starts to feel almost musical. The only thing that Rodriguez and Taylor a pair of amateurs dont do is burst entirely into song and they could. Theyre stars -- to themselves and therefore to us. By the films shockingly poignant final sequence theyve also become actresses. Theres a bit of Scorseses After Hours here at least in some of its surrealism though Bakers doing more celebrating than he is ironizing and decrying -- but not in a fashion-photographer party-planning-anthropologist sort of way. The film never loses sight of the risks and dangers and general ugliness of its colliding worlds. One bonkers motel sequence has a fundamental sadness that cant be upstaged by comedy. That the tone shifts there without costing Baker the movie indicates how soundly were in the hands of a confident humane artist. Hes not fetishizing or spotlight-shining. These people are the way they are the movie says. This obscenely vibrant patch of L.A. is officially an enclave. But Baker makes it feel bigger and louder and crazier than that. He turns subculture into family.

Cassidy Gifford and Ryan Shoos star in the film ""The Gallows."" Cassidy Gifford and Ryan Shoos star in the film ""The Gallows."" (Warner Bros.) Gary Goldstein Had the creators of the ""The Gallows"" ditched its overdone found-footage concept and opted for more traditional shooting they might have wrung a more immersive and stylish piece from the films juicy high-school theater setting.Still writers and directors Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing reportedly made this horror-thriller for about 100000 (plus completion funds from producers Entertainment 360 and Blumhouse) and their scrappy resourcefulness counters the often choppy tiresome visuals. The film takes place in a small Nebraska town (it was shot mainly in and around Fresno) where in 1993 a ""prop malfunction"" occurred during a high school production titled ""The Gallows."" The result the accidental hanging death of young thespian Charlie Grimille (Jesse Cross).Twenty years later the same school is remounting the play -- and it doesnt take a psychic to know this will be a bad idea. The night before the plays revival four students -- earnest ""Gallows"" cast members Reese (Reese Mishler) and Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown) Reeses jerky best bud Ryan (Ryan Shoos) and Ryans hot girlfriend Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) -- end up locked inside the school as it seems Charlies spirit is seeking revenge for his untimely death.

Credit Warner Bros. Pictures The horror movie ""The Gallows"" starts with a decent if improbable premise and it ends with a pretty good jolt. But in between the film sure wears out the already tired found-footage device.Back in 1993 the theater department at Beatrice High School was staging a play called ""The Gallows"" that went disastrously wrong when the pivotal set piece malfunctioned and left the male lead dead. Twenty years later the department (this is the improbable part; no school would allow such a thing) decides to restage the same play apparently as some kind of anniversary tribute. Video Trailer The Gallows Several students at a small-town high school die under mysterious circumstances. Twenty years later the school mounts a play to honor the anniversary of the tragic events. But some things are better left alone. By Warner Bros. Pictures on Publish Date May 26 2015. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed The night before the opening four students including the plays male and female stars (Reese Mishler and Pfeifer Brown) find themselves trapped in the auditorium by sinister forces. Is it the ghost of the student killed years earlier on the same stage? The creepy janitor? The socially spurned theater techie?We see practically all of this through hand-held video shot by one of the trapped students (Ryan Shoos) a boorish jock with a gorgeous girlfriend (Cassidy Gifford daughter of Frank and Kathie Lee). Rickety camerawork has been almost mandatory in horror movies for the last few decades and it has long since ceased to add to the scariness. Mostly its just annoying and thats certainly the case in this bothersome film directed by Chris Lofing and Travis Cluff.""The Gallows"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for frights and language.

The Gallows two good ideas in search of a third 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The bar for modern horror has been set so low that by now any movie better than terrible seems worthy of praise. Such is the case of ""The Gallows"" a movie that has two good ideas. It needed three. Its two good ideas have to do with its location and its method of filming. Most of it takes place in a high school at night where in true horror movie fashion an escalating series of really bad things happen to some really young people. And the footage that we see is what the hapless students supposedly recorded themselves. Thus everything that we see looks raw -- kind of like ""The Blair Witch Project."" Or in this case ""The Blair Drama Class Project."" In a pre-credits sequence set in 1993 we are shown the performance of a school play as recorded on a clunky VHS-based movie camera. The play within the movie is also called ""The Gallows"" and all is going well until the climactic scene when a platform accidentally gives way at precisely the wrong moment. Its the wrong moment because the kid standing on it happens to have a noose around his neck. Uh-oh. Flash forward some 20 years later. For some reason this same school is presenting a new production of ""The Gallows"" -- I suppose because the first one went so well. The day before the show is about to premiere three students sneak in to vandalize the set. They are surprised by a fourth student and soon theyre all locked in and cant get out. In the first section of ""The Gallows"" the movie is galvanized by the character of Ryan (Ryan Shoos) who is holding the camera and seems supercharged with malevolence. An irredeemably rotten and highly energized personality he is the films most interesting creation a spirit of spite and menace. Unfortunately having created him writer-directors Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing dont quite know how to make use of him. About midway into this relatively short film the gimmick of telling the story through amateur footage begins to grow stale. As a strategy for inducing fear it starts to wear off and its benefits become outweighed by its frustrations a big one being that the action becomes very hard to follow. Right around the same time the movies other good idea -- filming everything in one location -- starts to wear thin as well. A certain sameness to the scenes kicks in so that even though the movie is only 80 minutes long it wears out its welcome. This is precisely where a third idea would have come in handy something to get the action out of the high school something to seamlessly allow a change in filming method. Its the only bad thing about good ideas If filmmakers stick with one too long they risk putting themselves in a prison of their own making -- and cut themselves off from the next good idea which might have set them free. In ""The Gallows"" the filmmakers needed to set themselves free even more than the characters but they never find the path out. They probably never realized they were trapped.

Photo Warner Bros. Entertainment MOVIE REVIEW The Gallows Running time 87 minutes. Rated R (violence). Sixteen years after ""The Blair Witch Project"" movie studios continue their love affair with found-footage horror movies almost guaranteed profit centers that can be ground out for next to nothing since they dont require name actors elaborate location shooting careful camera work or much in the way of a coherent story. The nonsensical and virtually scare-free ""The Gallows"" is set entirely inside a Nebraska high school where officials have inexplicably approved a new production of the same play in which a student actor was accidentally strangled 20 years earlier. The football player (Reese Mishler) who has been conscripted into playing the male lead is talked by the productions obnoxious videographer (Ryan Shoos) into sneaking in late at night and destroying the sets the night before the show. Things do not go well for them. Also demonstrating what can happen when you give inexperienced actors enough rope to hang themselves with by asking them to improvise are Pfeifer Brown as the plays drama-queen lead and Cassidy Gifford spawn of Kathie Lee and Frank as a hysterical cheerleader. Even by the modest standards of the genre the ending is jaw-droppingly ridiculous.

Some scenes and plot twists are surprisingly well developed but none so much youll want to overlook a myriad of dumb plot developments.Film Details The Gallows RatingR GenreHorror Running Time81 min. More Info Trailer For example seeing vain cheerleader Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) admire herself in the camera-phone of disaffected jock-cameraman Ryan (Ryan Shoos) is mildly clever because it makes a later sequence where Cassidy examines a mysterious neck wound in a Blair Witch Project-esque up-the-nose extreme close-up seem less implausible. Still The Gallows makes it too easy to wonder why Ryan and his pals dont use their cells earlier or consistently stick together while exploring their famously haunted high school auditorium or make the many other logical decisions that viewers will think of between programmatic scare scenes.Cluff and Lofing likewise squander all the goodwill they generate with impressive tromp loeil special effects by jiggling their handheld cameras so hard that it sometimes feels like youre watching an unofficial Saving Private Ryan sequel. Ryan occasionally puts his camera down but when he does you wish Cluff and Lofing had dared to imagine this high school kid had access to a tripod and some cheap filmmaking courses.

"The Gallows snaps under weight of silly ending | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Gallows snaps under weight of silly endingThe Gallows squanders its initial promise and some decent scares on an ending that feels like a major letdown.Cassidy Gifford as Cassidy Spilker and Ryan Shoos as Ryan Shoos wish they hadnt gone back to school after hours in the new teen horror film The Gallows.  (TNS)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. July 9 2015The GallowsStarring Reese Mishler Pfeifer Brown. Written and directed by Travis Cluff Chris Lofing. 81 minutes. Opens Friday at GTA Theatres. 14A.Thinking about swinging by your local theatre to see the latest teens-in-peril horror flick The Gallows? You may want to hang back.Because -- despite its initial promise and some decent scares -- youre in for a sharp and sudden drop in satisfaction in the final throes.Article Continued BelowThe story goes something like this 20 years ago at a Nebraska high school a kid named Charlie suffers death by hanging during a performance of a decidedly grim high school play called The Gallows. (Wouldnt a musical have been a bit more teenage-appropriate?)In the present day when an inexplicable decision is made to restage it the star of the play high school jock Reese is persuaded by mischievous friend Ryan to break in after-hours and destroy the set in hopes of derailing the production. (This at least is plausible. Reese cant seem to remember his lines the day before the show and his acting on stage is to say the least wooden. Breaking a leg -- literally -- in this case would have been a far more judicious solution.)In the darkened school Reese Ryan and Ryans girlfriend Cassidy are joined by Pfeifer the girl who persuaded Reese to trade gridiron glory for the theatre and before you can say ""what was that sound?"" theyre trapped and being terrorized by a noose-wielding vengeful spirit.This being the digital age the footage is all recorded via cellphones and woe be he or she who fails to properly recharge in advance because when the low-battery indicator comes on grisly death is not far behind.Directors Travis Cluff and Chris Loring use this found footage device to their best advantage in creating dark shadow-filled scenes steeped in foreboding and suspense even if at times they become a bit jarring and disorienting. For reasons unknown all four principals have the same first names as their characters but only Reese Mishler as Reese Houser demonstrates any actual emotive ability. The other three looking and acting more like 90210 habitues make no discernible effort to portray Midwest cornhuskers.The gore along with the bad language is kept to a minimum -- ensuring a 14A rating -- and the script co-written by Cluff and Loring has a few serviceable red herrings to generate doubt about the source of the ghostly goings-on. There are even occasional moments of gallows humour as it were though they seem to be mostly unintentional.The whole effort will be somewhat diverting for young horror fans but hang it all its the ending that strains the suspension of disbelief past the breaking point and like a snapped rope leaves the film in a muddled heap on the floor.

The scene in question finds terrified cheerleader Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford daughter of Kathie Lee) desperately trying to regain her composure after boyfriend Ryan (Ryan Shoos) disappears and strange ligature marks begin to appear around her neck. As she weeps in the audiences direction a hooded figure begins to emerge from the shadows behind her--silently steadily with the same eerie calm that Michael Myers possessed back when the horror revolution began. Its a remarkably tense quietly terrifying 90 seconds of film that acts as both a respite from the chaos and a reminder that the simplest scares are the best. The key word above is ""steadily"" which is not an apt descriptor for the rest of the action in The Gallows. This is another found-footage movie that with a little art direction and some actual cinematography could easily have been a decent little terrorizer. Instead it comes mostly unglued thanks to its hacky gimmick. The story is reasonably compelling A high school drama club is staging a play called The Gallows that was last performed 20 years prior and ended in the accidental death of one of its performers. Former football player Reese (Reese Mishler) isnt very good in the lead role but hes gutting through it in order to woo co-star and queen bee Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown). Reeses best friend Ryan who is inexplicably recording everything hatches a plan Along with Cassidy hell help Reese break into the school after hours and dismantle the set thus making the one-night-only performance impossible and saving Reese from the humiliation of the stage. Thats a remarkably stupid premise to get our characters together in one place and the early scares are pedestrian haunted house stuff doors that lock mysteriously strange noises and at least one television that turns on by itself. In fact the first hour of The Gallows is made insufferable by Ryan who acts as the cameraman and narrates the action. Even for a teen in a middling scream-fest hes particularly obnoxious and his stream-of-consciousness vacillates between lunkheaded juvenilia and observations that are remarkably convenient to the plot. There is one upside Ryans violent exit from the film is one of the most satisfying dispatches of a horror teen in recent memory. It might just be a coincidence but Ryans departure lets The Gallows breathe easier. The late twists actually carry some weight the murderous apparition becomes more visceral and the final sequence--again filmed with a still camera--is genuinely unnerving. Even the coda which in these types of movies is often a cheap and banal suggestion of a sequel works better than most. But for all its potential and almost-hits The Gallows is still only about 22 percent of a good movie and only slightly more refined than your average high school production of The Crucible.

The stylistic trick - hey heres a bunch of video we just happened to dig up - got its first big exposure in 1999 with ""The Blair Witch Project"" and has ruled low-budget horror movies ever since. The advantages? A certain surface amount of realism. Also more obviously a bargain-basement aesthetic that tries to make a virtue out of poor visuals cheap sound and no tripods. The disadvantages? A lot of far-fetched moments. Also more annoyingly an ugly look full of night-vision lighting herky-jerky camerawork and too many pictures of peoples feet. The latest exhibit in this chintzy creepshow ""The Gallows."" The story starts in 1993 when an accident in a school play leaves one student hanging around fatally from the titular stage prop. Skip ahead two decades as a new class decides to restage the same play. Except someone doesnt want them to. And quickly gruesomely starts cutting the cast. The photography is by definition amateurish and the actors arent much better. Cassidy Gifford spray-tanned and snippy is at least believably annoying as a cheerleader and Reese Mishler is a good-looking lunk as a dopey athlete. But supporting actors Ryan Shoos and Pfeiffer Brown just make you wish the killer would get to work now and none of them holds our attention or engages our sympathy. Nor does the movie build its scares is any interesting or believable way. The plot is a collection of contrivances (Oh no the lights all went out My cell phone wont work Im running for my life Id better keep filming) and the scares are simple sudden stupid shocks. And as usual the deliberately home-made look robs the movie of any of the things - a thrilling score evocative camera movements clever editing - that generally make movies feel like movies. The ""found footage"" gimmick was novel in ""The Blair Witch Project"" where it added a new level of low-fi fear. And some of the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies have found new ways to exploit it (particularly by using a fixed-viewpoint camera that involves audiences making them search the frame for frights). But in ""The Gallows"" the real purpose for the style - the only reason - is to answer the question Dude how cheaply can we make this? To which the obviously answer is Wow pretty cheaply bro. Also pretty badly. Ratings note The film contains violence. The Gallows (R) Warner Bros (81 min.) Directed by Travis Cluff Chris Lofing. With Reese Mishler Pfeifer Brown Ryan Shoos Cassidy Gifford.

Sign up for our Newsletters. Daily Edition Login to download The Gallows Film Review 1000 AM PDT 7/9/2015 by Stephen Farber FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures Fails to generate any suspense. TWITTER This low-budget teen horror movie about a jinxed high-school play is told in the popular ""found footage"" style. Once there was a certain novelty to horror films in the ""found footage"" mode supposedly shot with amateur video cameras rather than professional equipment. The Blair Witch Project launched the trend and since then weve seen Cloverfield the Paranormal Activity franchise and many other examples. So The Gallows is not going to win any prizes for originality. Any film that tries to revive this technique needs a clever story or unusual filmmaking ingenuity to stand out from the crowd. The Gallows has neither. It has enough mild scares to captivate the under-25 crowd and the budget was obviously bargain basement. So Warners cant lose money on this release. First-time filmmakers Chris Lofing and Travis Cluff present most of this story as if it had been caught on cellphones though they actually shot with a variety of cameras designed to have the right grainy look. Anyone prone to vertigo should avoid the film since the dizzying handheld shots mainly in very dark rooms are not exactly a pleasure to watch. The story itself is not unpromising. Twenty years ago during a high school production of a play called ""The Gallows"" a freak accident led to the young lead actor being killed onstage. Now for rather unconvincing reasons the school decides to mount this jinxed production again. But someone is clearly seeking revenge for what happened 20 years earlier. This revenge plot kicks in when three popular high school kids decide to sneak into the school auditorium on the night before the premiere to destroy the set. Their plans go awry when they are trapped in a locked auditorium with all phone lines down. A fourth student the lead actress in the play also joins them as they seek to escape from an unseen visitor who seems determined to wipe them out one by one. Since the kids decision to sabotage the production seems to have been a last-minute whim its hard to believe that all of the mayhem could have been so well orchestrated unless a supernatural force is at work. Even granting that possibility there are too many plot holes. And the deliberately slipshod camera style limits the possibility of terror. A couple of shots are suitably creepy like a shadowy figure noose in hand slowly sneaking up on the head cheerleader. The effective sound design by Brandon Jones does compensate for the visual monotony but this can only go so far in scaring viewers. Theres also a problem in terms of audience identification. Two of the kids -- the videographer Ryan (Ryan Shoos) and the cheerleader Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford) -- are insensitive fairly hateful teens in the mold of those who tormented poor Carrie (in arguably the best teen horror movie ever made) 40 years ago so we dont care about them when they are attacked. The other two are more sympathetic but they turn out to have unexpected connections to the original castmembers from 20 years ago. The lead actors who all have the same first names as the characters they play are appealing but we cant quite judge their talent on the basis of these one-dimensional roles. Similarly the filmmakers might do better if offered a bigger budget but its hard to make any confident predictions based on this cheesy offering.

Jones The Bleader Film July 09 2015 Movies | Movie Review Tweet Pin It Reprints Share The Gallows keeps you hanging on The latest horror flick from Blumhouse Productions honors the genres long tradition of poor decision making. By Gwynedd Stuart gwynnstu The Gallows The Gallows  Directed by Travis Cluff and Cliff Lofing The fictitious high school play The Gallows isnt very good judging from what we see of it during the real horror movie The Gallows. The dialogue is thin bordering on cryptic; the characters motivations are unclear; and most important--at least for the schools liability insurer--it climaxes with an execution on a fully functioning gallows which has already resulted in one students accidental death back in 1993. Remounting the play 20 years later is morbid at best and negligent at worst but then again bad decisions are the foundation upon which the horror genre was built. After all if the Lutz family hadnt purchased a suspiciously inexpensive Dutch Colonial home on Long Island we wouldnt have The Amityville Horror. The Gallows opens with a videocam recording of the ill-fated 90s production the two parents behind the camera engaging in ridiculously expository banter. Charlie the actor playing the lead role is killing it but the parents barely have time to praise the realistic gallows before a noose is tightened around his neck a trapdoor gives way beneath his feet and his life ends with a loud crack. Fast-forward to 2013. From the balcony of the same theater the obnoxious Ryan (Ryan Shoos) records his friend Reese (Reese Mishler--yes the main characters were all named after the actors to help them get into it) as he rehearses the same role that claimed Charlies life. But unlike Charlie Reese sucks. Hes taken the role only because he has a crush on the female lead Pfeifer (Brown) which subjects him to lots of teasing from Ryan a jock and an enthusiastic bully of theater geeks. Ryan talks Reese into returning to the school that night entering through an unlocked side door and destroying the set so the show cant go on. Ryans girlfriend Cassidy (Gifford the spawn of Frank and Kathie Lee) tags along. Their plan quickly unravels Pfeifer shows up all wide-eyed confusion and they discover that the unlocked door is now locked tight. Continuing the tradition of poor decision making the teens have embarked on their mission with nary a flashlight among them so as they search for an exit taunted by something supernatural their only illumination is the light on Ryans video camera--hence their documentation of the terror. The film plays out as a sort of drama-nerd revenge fantasy in which the cool kids become prey. A first cut was completed in 2012 by Chris Lofing and Travis Cluff two industry outsiders from far-flung Fresno for just 15000 then made ""theater-ready"" once it got some interest and some more money. Cluff has said that they also added ""more scares"" so the money must have been well spent. The Gallows is a perfectly fun entry in Blumhouse Productions ever-growing roster of low-budget mock-verite chillers (Insidious Paranormal Activity). But high school drama teachers across the nation may have a tough time casting those fall productions of The Crucible and You Cant Take It With You.  v Trailer More Movie Review >> Tags Movie Review The Gallows Travis Cluff Cliff Lofing Blumhouse Productions Insidious Paranormal Activity found footage Recommended Email Share Digg Newsvine del.icio.us Facebook Reddit Twitter Windy Citizen Add to favorites Saving...

July 9 2015 | 1000AM PT This derivative found-footage horror movie wont hang around in theaters for long. One advantage of selling horror movies to teenagers is that theyre less likely to already know all the genre tropes. Thats about the only thing working for ""The Gallows"" a routine found-footage chiller of interest mostly to those who werent yet old enough to catch ""Paranormal Activity"" in its theatrical release a mere six years ago. Fortunately the microbudget feature helming debut of Chris Lofing and Travis Cluff has a relatively low bar to clear at the B.O. even if grosses fall short of the summers other spookfests ""Poltergeist"" and ""Insidious Chapter 3."" The filmmakers quickly establish their mythology in an effective enough urban-legend-caught-on-videotape opening sequence set in 1993 in which Nebraska high-school thespian Charlie Grimille literally dies onstage in a freak accident during a school play. Twenty years later the school has rather inexplicably scheduled a tribute performance of the same play titled ""The Gallows"" despite concerns from some parents that Charlies ghost haunts the auditorium where he perished. Such paranormal activity is the last thing on the mind of football star Reese (Reese Mishler) moonlighting as the revivals lead actor in order to nurse a schoolboy crush on leading lady Pfeifer (Pfeifer Brown). The would-be romance is an endless source of amusement for Reeses obnoxious buddy Ryan (Ryan Shoos) whose convenient habit of filming everything he sees provides our window onto the action. The kid has a knack for being in the right place at the right time and framing key conversations like a pro even when he leaves his camera unattended on the ground. Ryan is also responsible for the films requisite terrible idea when he convinces Reese they should break into the school at night and destroy the plays set saving the less-than-confident Reese from embarrassing himself onstage in front of Pfeifer on opening night. Ryans peppy cheerleader g.f. Cassidy (Cassidy Gifford daughter of Frank and Kathie Lee) insists on tagging along but the attempted vandalism hits a snag when Pfeifer unexpectedly shows up too. Thats the least of the gangs problems when they discover theyre locked inside the building their phones dont work and a crucial part of the set they thought was destroyed -- the steps to the titular gallows and a noose exactly like the one that snapped Charlies neck -- mysteriously reassembles. After deciding to explore the bowels of the school in search of a way out things go from bad to worse faster than anyone can say ""phantom of the opera."" Getting locked inside an empty school at night is a solidly bone-chilling premise for teens and a certain subset of that audience wont mind that nearly every one of Lofing and Cluffs ostensibly scary setpieces can be seen coming a mile away (mostly because weve already seen them in other movies). Loud noises narrow corridors locker doors opening and closing on their own a television set that turns on by itself to provide expositional news footage -- ""The Gallows"" isnt without a certain amount of atmosphere it simply feels borrowed wholesale. That would matter less with a better script but the four main characters are paper-thin even by genre norms. The painfully protracted first act depends on the assumed improbability that an athlete would date a drama geek (hasnt anyone in this town seen ""Glee""?) and the climactic twist raises more questions than it answers; without spoiling suffice it to say the teens are up against a very patient and very vengeful spirit with a soft spot for needlessly elaborate schemes. ""The Gallows"" is the sort of forgettable programmer that could be due for rediscovery down the line in the event that one of its fresh-faced cast members blossoms into a genuine movie star. Judging by the admittedly slim basis of whats onscreen the best bet would be Gifford who stands out as both the most charismatic and comfortable on camera among the central quartet. Cinematographer Edd Lukas has the thankless job of making everything the audience sees look like it was captured by narcissistic and/or terrified teens and if some of those moments are a little too polished -- especially the striking way in which the climax unfolds in a single shot from behind the action (at least until a second camera is introduced) -- he can be forgiven for not playing down to the material.

"The Gallows review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Gallows review Same old found-footage horror with a few twists The Gallows Warner Bros. Pictures Pfeifer Brown and Reese Mishler star in ""The Gallows."" Pfeifer Brown and Reese Mishler star in ""The Gallows."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The first found-footage horror movie shot in Fresno. At the end of the last century ""The Blair Witch Project"" popularized the notion of idiots in horror movies filming every second of their own imminent demise. A deliberately unpolished subgenre was born found-footage horror cheap to make (with some higher-budget exceptions ""Cloverfield"" among them) profitable in a flash.The latest of these is ""The Gallows"" shot for a buck-eighty-three in Fresno Calif. by the writers-directors Chris Lofing and Travis Cluff. Picked up by ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Insidious"" producer Jason Blum and distributed by Warner Brothers this minimally clever addition to the existing pile of scares fright and videotape doesnt seem likely to become a ""Paranormal Activity""-type phenomenon. Then again neither did ""Paranormal Activity."" Lofing and Cluff have a couple of sound ideas in their favor. ""The Gallows"" is set mainly inside a Nebraska high school in and around a cavnernous auditorium after hours in the dark. Theres something innately scary about the locale -- the hopes and dreams of the stage colliding with the supernatural. The story concerns a fatally ill-advised revival of a play. Anyone who has endured an especially bad stage revival or two over the years may go into ""The Gallows"" screaming as I did. Eighty minutes later I came out shrugging but time and the opening weekend will tell how the target audience responds.The movie begins as most found-footage horror movies begin with found footage that has become forensic evidence. Its 1993 in nondescript Beatrice Neb. Were watching camcorder tape of opening night of a play called ""The Gallows"" which appears to be a gory variation on the thees-and-thous realm of ""The Crucible."" The stage is dominated by a scaffold and a noose. ""They did a great job on the gallows"" a voice behind the camera says. One prop malfunction later theres a dead young actor a lot of screaming and a jump cut to 2013. Despite sensible school board objections the drama department has decided to remount the play this time with a star football player in the role of the boy to be hanged. Reese Mishler plays the fledgling actor also named Reese; his costar a devoted drama student is played by Pfeifer Brown. Belligerent unsympathetic jock Ryan (Ryan Shoos) hatches a plan to break into the school at night and with the help of Reese and Cassidy (Cassidy Erin Gifford daughter of Kathie Lee and Frank Gifford) trash the set. The spectre with the noose has other plans. The Gallows (Trailer) ""The Gallows"" is a horror film full of suspense starring Cassidy Gifford Pfeifer Brown Ryan Shoos Reese Mishler Alexis Schneider and Price T. Morgan.

Such is the hurdle you must get over with every found-footage horror movie. Lofing and Cluff certainly know the found-footage ropes and the tropes; well see if their next project reveals a little more imagination. Each time were in the presence of the demon-ghost (theres one in every high school drama department) ""The Gallows"" cranks up the predictable metallic KLAA-chonnnggg sound effects to the point that you wonder Is this the first film to be directed by the ""Law amp; Order"" gavel?The cast is tiny so that when you realize Lofing and Cluff are playing a game of ""And Then There Were None"" its a pretty short game indeed. Brown fares best among a blandly characterized lot. Stupidly ""The Gallows"" was given an R rating by the MPAA ratings board though the activity is relatively bloodless. This I suppose is the MPAAs way of making up for all the PG-13 blockbusters laden with violence deserving of an R. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In The Gallows four teenagers are menaced by the ghost of a student who died in a freak accident two decades earlier. Charlie the dead kid was the star of the school play a period piece (also called The Gallows) that ended with his characters execution by hanging. Because this is a found-footage horror movie the first thing we see is home-video imagery of opening night when the platform beneath Charlies feet actually gave out and a real rope snapped tight around his neck. Now Charlies back in supernatural form just in time for the 20th anniversary of his demise which the drama department has opted to commemorate by performing The Gallows anew. Poor taste for sure but isnt the malevolence misplaced? Charlie should really be peeved at the director and stage manager of that first production who threw caution to the wind with a dangerous setup or maybe just himself for agreeing to stick his head into a rigged noose. But then a ghost haunted by his own poor judgment probably wouldnt put too many hairs on end.Set on the eve of the new productions premiere The Gallows unfolds chiefly through the camera lens of Ryan (Ryan Shoos because yes this is one of those found-footage films where most of the characters are named for the actors playing them as though that fools anyone). Fond of picking on the geeky stage hands and putting down his cheerleader girlfriend (Cassidy Gifford) Ryan essentially serves the same function as the amateur cameraman of Cloverfield He provides frat-boyish comic relief when not zooming in on pertinent expository information. Early into the film the jock jokester stops to comment on the inappropriateness of his school keeping an original Gallows cast photo prominently displayed behind glass. Its the smartest thing anyone will say or do in this movie.A high school after hours isnt the worst setting for a horror film and theres potential in the idea of a new stage production literally haunted by the ghosts of an old one. But once its rounded up all of its principals including a football-star-turned-thespian (Reese Mishler) and his theater-kid crush (Pfeifer Brown) The Gallows falls quickly into the usual pitfalls of the genre. The lack of an especially frightening villain doesnt help While you have to commend Charlie for his conceptual consistency his weapon of choice (a rope naturally) only has a couple of murderous applications. Compounding the problem is the fact that the kids hes stringing up exhibit typically stupid behavior--wandering off alone climbing onto precarious ledges even mocking the evil spirit thats got it out for them. Making audiences care about the characters is always a more effective fear-generating strategy than just knocking off a bunch of dimwits in the dark.The Gallows adds only one wrinkle to its all-too-familiar format Rather than just crosscut between the two cameras Ryan and company cart around with them directors Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing essentially rewind the timeline to show the same events from separate perspectives--allowing for example the viewer to see what really happened to a character that appeared to die offscreen a few minutes earlier. Unfortunately the movie never does anything clever or interesting with that technique nor does it effectively exploit the common conventions of found-footage horror. The Gallows is just another cheapo mock-doc fright flight shakily trailing a gaggle of attractive screaming nobodies as nooses literal and otherwise tighten around their throats. Isnt it curtains already for this tired trend?

EntertainmentMovies The Gallows hangs on too many horror-movie cliches Originally published July 9 2015 at 1205 am Updated July 9 2015 at 809 am Pfeifer Brown left and Reese Mishler star in ""The Gallows."" A review of the cheap found-footage teen-horror movie ""The Gallows"" starring Reese Mishler and Ryan Shoos. Rating 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic ""Why did I do this stupid play?"" plaintively asks Reese (Reese Mishler) a high-school thespian trapped with three other students in a dark auditorium overnight with a costumed hangman/ghost/creature whos trying to kill them. Why indeed. That play a period piece called ""The Gallows"" is the center of Chris Lofing and Travis Cluffs teen-horror movie of the same name; it was last performed at the high school 20 years ago when a kid got killed on the gallows. (Because of course all high-school productions have working gallows on which its possible to hang yourself.) Now a new crop of students is putting on the play again (presumably nobody at this high school can think) with a new gallows that will totally work this time -- and you guessed it evil doings are afoot. Yet another cheap found-footage horror flick (the idea here is that Reeses video-obsessed pal Ryan played by Ryan Shoos is filming the whole thing) ""The Gallows"" has all the usual cliches the ominous bangs and clangs from somewhere in the dark auditorium; the camera batterys diva-like way of dying at the least convenient moment; the ""Blair Witch""-style weepy close-up with both mascara and nose a-running. A few moments early on are entertaining particularly Pfeifer Brown as the most irritating girl in the Drama Club (shes so pleased with herself you can almost see the imaginary Oscar in her hand). But too quickly its all just blurry camera work and noise -- with neither scares nor drama. Try Shakespeare next time Reese.
