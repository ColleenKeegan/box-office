Rug actors played indoor parts--those requiring love scenes and speechifying--while their dust counterparts were good for action and shoot-em-ups.In the golden years of Denzel Washington however hes amply proven he can play both dust and rug. The 60-year-old actor has spent the latter part of his career perfecting two seemingly incongruous character types--the bookish teacher and the merciless vigilante killer. Hes made a convincing professor coach and life mentor Remember the Titans Malcolm X Cry Freedom and The Great Debaters had him speaking inspirational quotes in place of dialogue. But in Training Day Man on Fire American Gangster and Safe House he cut an equally believable criminal indulging in violence and other vices while plastered with a grim Bogart-like grin.Related Story Expendables 3 No Movie This Stupid Should Be This Complicated Thats what makes The Equalizer out in theaters today the ultimate Denzel movie. In it he delivers English lectures uplifting speeches dance moves (to Gladys Knight amp; the Pips) and brutal staple-gun assassinations. He passes a lot of time reading leatherbound gold-embossed classics of the Western canon; he spends the rest of his time killing. He makes easy friends with young lost people in need of instruction; he makes enemies pretty quickly too (or he would if only he allowed them to live long enough to develop opinions). This is all to say that The Equalizer synthesizes Washingtons uber-character a righteous assassin who is also a deep lover of and sometimes-teacher of literature.                             At the movies open our hero Robert McCall (""Bob"" to those who dont know him) is more apt scholar than aging-gentleman action hero. By day Robert manages in an orange apron at the movies equivalent of the Home Depot Home Mart (product placement abounds in this very commercial movie but apparently the hardware retailer wasnt eager to lend its name to what becomes essentially the Equalizers serial-killing supply closet). He befriends an employee in need of some weight-loss motivation warning against the ills of sodium and refined sugar--and seemingly leads by example too for almond milk is visible in his grocery bag. By night hes proffering life advice to the troubled young prostitute Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz) at a 24-hour diner and schooling her on The Old Man and the Sea all of which savors of Remember the Titans teachings (Gettysburg history) or The Great Debaters uplifting lectures (Langston Hughes).Denzels pedantic in the ways of kicking ass too.Robert uses Hemingway to bolster his advice that Alina should start following her dreams not streetwalking. But he also uses Hemingway to explain why after she gets beaten to a pulp by her cruel Russian pimp he embarks on an unrelenting killing spree that begins with the perpetrators and then extends to Bostons criminal underworld at large. Why doesnt the old man just let the fish go Alina asks in one scene? ""Old mans gotta be the old man fish has gotta be the fish. You gotta be who you are in this world no matter what"" he replies. And so it is that Denzels gotta be what Denzels gotta be an East Coast crime-syndicate-conquering avenger with a thing for inventive DIY torture and the star of another ""Geri-Action"" blockbuster.Which means his characters pedantic in the ways of kicking ass too. As Robert gets on with the slaughter of dozens of pimps and criminals the movie becomes a primer in how to read an everyday situation and then determine the best ways in which to kill the people in it. Point-of-view slow-motion shots during fight scenes cue the audience into the thinking that goes into the making of a useful microwave bomb or how to dress gunshot wounds using the contents of the common cupboard. The movies very upfront about its educational component Before my screening Sony brought in an MMA fighter to demonstrate some self-defense moves.These kinds of analytical breakdowns of a characters mental process were first made popular on the BBC series Sherlock where the stakes are often equally explosive but the characters are less mentorlike. The Equalizer by contrast makes critical thinking and efficient killing fairly synonymous. Theres even a sequence in which a delivery truck for the Boston Herald aids Roberts getaway from the murder scene torture with a pro-reading messageTorture with a pro-reading messageAll of this has a strange commercial logic. Todays lucrative late-career action stars are for the most part cashing in on their greatest hits and pre-established celebrity. When Andrew Romano investigated what he called the ""Neesification"" of action movies for The Daily Beast earlier this year he learned these films are conceived for older-demographic moviegoers who remain fannishly loyal to particular stars especially Washington Sean Penn and Liam Neeson. Some movies in the genre like The Expendables play off previously established action reputations (Willis Norris Stallone Van Damme); others such as Red and Taken make the most of the novelty of a respected thespian (Mirren Freeman Neeson) transforming into a fast-moving killer.Washington lies somewhere in between those two poles He can play prestigious and win Oscars; he can also believably off baddies. And hes so good at playing teacher and killer that The Equalizers attempt at a ""smart blockbuster"" almost works. The movie nearly makes the argument that one can both cherish Hemingway and kill in his name.Ultimately though its plentiful author name-dropping and deliberate action filmmaking is just dumb. The movies all about reading especially with a critical eye but when you take too close a look at its disparate parts they neither add up nor have anything constructive to teach. Robert preaches that the younger players should hold themselves to a higher standard to create a better life for themselves but he doesnt take his own advice. Instead of getting a new job as he recommends Alina do he backslides into fashioning barbed-wire nooses at the workplace. He eats well but its all in service of disarming gunslingers effectively enough to merit an accompanying power ballad by Eminem and Sia. Ultimately Denzels leading but its by a very gruesome example.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

"Equalizer The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; equalizer-the ) Equalizer The (United States 2014) September 26 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli When The Equalizer arrived on television in the 1980s it was notable for two things being the first Reagan-era show to lionize vigilantism and presenting an ""advocate"" who broke the Curtis Sliwa-inspired stereotypes. Edward Woodwards Robert McCall could use violence and lethal force when necessary but he was also cultured older and British. The Equalizer never felt like every other crime show on network television and the differences allowed it to survive for four seasons. 25 years later The Equalizer is regarded with a certain amount of nostalgia-fueled fondness by older viewers but this isnt a series crying out for a big-screen resurrection. For that reason director Anton Fuqua has jettisoned almost everything related to the TV series except the title the main characters name and the bare-bones premise. Even the theme song is gone. For all intents and purposes The Equalizer isnt so much a reboot as it is an entirely new entity. Fuqua working from a screenplay by Richard Wenk elects to develop The Equalizer as a slow-burn thriller rather than a fast-paced one. There are action scenes - some of which are bloody and brutal - but partially keeping mind the age of star Denzel Washington (59) they are brief and use fast cutting to obscure some of the specifics. For the most part The Equalizer is a character study about a man haunted by his past seeking a path to redemption. We never learn the specifics about what led Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) to resign from the CIA but we know it led to his faking his own death and deciding to live an anonymous life as a shelf stocker at Home Depot. Fuqua infuses The Equalizer with a low-key energy and is in no hurry to rush into things. The camera lingers over Boston in the evening capturing some glorious sunset shots. This moody setup is critical to getting the viewer in the right place so that when the violence starts its shocking. McCall isnt a hero who kills as a last resort; he kills because thats the only way to remove a threat. The villains in The Equalizer are from the school of uber-badassery. There are three of them each representing a different level of threat as McCall works his way up the chain of power of a Russian mob cell operating on Americas East Coast. The first pimp Slavi (David Meunier) is a frothing-at-the-mouth psychopath. The second Teddy (Marton Csokas) is as cold and venomous as a coiled snake. The third big boss Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich) stays in the shadows and moves his operatives like a puppet master. The Equalizer does a good job illustrating McCalls confrontations with the first two but Pushkins involvement is resolved too quickly and conveniently to be satisfying. McCall is shocked out of his life of quiet contemplation when Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) an underage prostitute he knows from their (platonic) encounters at a coffee shop is brutally beaten by Slavi for hitting an abusive client. McCall offers Slavi 9800 to buy Teris freedom. When the offer is rebuffed the ex CIA agent uses decisive means to give Teri back her life. It turns out that Slavi isnt just a pimp and drug dealer however - hes a key cog in Pushkins multi-million dollar operation. The mob boss dispatches Teddy to Boston where with the help of corrupt cop Masters (David Harbour) he hunts McCall while in turn McCall hunts him. Meanwhile ""The Equalizer"" personality begins to emerge as McCall starts helping people with ""little"" problems like thieves who steal valuable personal belongings and police who demand protection payments. Echoing the performance he gave in 2004s Man on Fire Washington shows that he can bring a thoughtful moodiness to a hard-edged character. This is the actors second teaming with Fuqua and its clear they have a rapport. Although McCall is less combustible than the character Washington played in Training Day (for which he won an Oscar) he is no less decisive. Fuqua doesnt believe in protagonists who dither no matter how dirty their white hats may be and Washington is capable of delivering a performance that matches this desire. McCall is a heroic figure but he exists in a gray zone. And while The Equalizer exhibits no powers that would be deemed superhuman hes clever and resourceful at times seeming like a MacGyver of Mahem. Although composer Harry Gregson-Williams claims not to remember Stewart Copelands TV show theme there are echoes of it throughout the score. The music and camerawork together create a fascinating collage of Boston incredible beauty hiding a seamy dangerous underworld. Fuqua orchestrates The Equalizer so suspense builds incrementally with Gregson-Williams music amplifying the tension until it is released in an action sequence. As the movie closes in on its ending it gives into the generic expectations of the genre and the perfunctory epilogue is rushed. On the whole however The Equalizer is likely to please anyone willing to accept a new interpretation of the basic storyline rather than a traditional remake.

Washington plays Robert McCall (as in ""Who ya gonna McCall?"") a gentle paternalistic self-effacing low-level manager at a Home Depot-like hardware store. He lives in an unadorned apartment and eats by his lonesome every night at the same diner where he reads the latest in a line of good-mental-hygiene classics of the Western canon. (The aging widower is working on Hemingways The Old Man and the Sea.) He makes small talk with the regulars among them Chloe Grace Moretz as Teri a Russian-born hooker with dreams of being a singer-songwriter. When Teri starts showing up with shiners -- and worse -- McCall is quietly stricken. He knows the world is full of very bad men but what can a peaceable sweetie do against crooked cops and psychopathic Russian mobsters? Youd be surprised. Or not if youve seen the previews -- and about a thousand other films with the same arc. Few are as classy as this one though. The EqualizerA -- which takes its premise from the 80s TV show starring that hoary Brit Edward Woodward -- has an unusually polished script and first-rate production values and Fuqua holds off on the carnage for at least half an hour to distinguish it from boneheaded B and C movies playing all night on cable. It opens with a quote from no less than Mark Twain ""The most important days in your life are the day you were born and the day you find out why."" McCall it seems was born to even the odds between the strong and the weak the haves and have-nots. It would be great if Fuqua had turned him loose on Wall Street instead of the usual scummy gangsters -- let him crusade for equal pay for equal work or higher carbon taxes to offset damage to public health. Maybe he can do that in the sequel. In this one hes too busy jamming corkscrews into bad guys throats and giving them a twist. The only real shock in this utterly routine movie -- when was the last time you saw a lone hero stride toward the climactic killing ground in slow motion? Yesterday? An hour ago? -- is the contrast between the heros recessive demeanor and the insane quantity of gore that he generates. Movies are full of righteous executioners (among them Washington himself in Man on Fire) but none has ever done so much slaughtering with a halo so firmly affixed. In his physical resourcefulness and readiness to kill (he doesnt take prisoners) McCall resembles Lee Childs do-gooder executioner Jack Reacher -- recently misembodied by the diminutive Tom Cruise. But Reacher at least acts like a cocky jerk instead of Gandhi with a Glock. McCall has a backstory -- he apparently did some things hes not proud of -- but here hes the Father of Us All. Who could possibly be worthy of being killed by him? McCalls principal opponent is a Russian fixer called Teddy played by Marton Csokas. (""Hes a sociopath with a business card. He wont stop until he kills you and anyone you care about"") As a boy Teddy murdered his kindly adoptive parents. As a grown-up he smashes skulls and (in an appallingly protracted scene) lovingly strangles a prostitute who tried to help Teri. Much of his body is covered with a single demonic tattoo and in one scene he throws back his naked torso and appears to be calling out to Old Scratch himself. The only really fun thing in The Equalizer is the way he puzzles and puzzles and puzzles over McCall whos busy shooting and stabbing and breaking the necks of Teddys allies. This fellow makes no sense he says ""Everything about him is wrong."" Teddy has the wondrous innocence of a man who has never seen a vigilante-revenge movie.

"The Good the Bad and the Denzel Washington Does Cool Justice in The Equalizer While The Guest Is a Smartly Stupid Thriller << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com The Good the Bad and the Denzel Washington Does Cool Justice in The Equalizer While The Guest Is a Smartly Stupid Thriller Movies September 26 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print In The Equalizer Denzel Washington looks thick and jowly. His head is bald and his face while round is hard and tense. By day his character Robert McCall works as a manager at a big hardware store in East Boston. By night he steps out of shadows and beats crooked cops straight. He spills the blood of a jittery cash-register robber and as part of the plots centerpiece takes down a Russian crime syndicate using wits weapons and opportune slow motion. In the finale (one of them; this movie keeps ending) he seems to sail through the soak of fire sprinklers like a float at the Macys parade. It barely matters where you stand on Washington as a star to recognize that this absurd grisly relentless subversively feel-goodish entertainment amounts to one thing Denzel pornography. (The multiple endings are multiorgasmic.) You might not be able to arrive at an intelligible definition but you know it when you see it. And when you see McCall doing one of those calm walks away from a massive explosion you know youre seeing Denzel porn. This is a man so cool he takes a city bus to the films first finale. Click here for more 2014 awards season coverage. The movie is based on the old smoothly plotted and photographed CBS show. (Film now gives it the retroactive look of cinema.) That series lasted four seasons with Edward Woodward playing McCall as a sexily seasoned lapsed English dandy. He wore blazers and trench coats and styled his hair. He was debonairly haggard. Washingtons version appears to be childless but sports dad jeans. The show worked because almost every week presented a fresh occasion for Woodward to elegantly pull the trigger on killers racists and rapists -- and to do so with a moral clarity and synth score that keep it a pure 1980s specimen. It was too socially polished and a touch too politically correct for the Dirty Harry era. The movie makes McCalls vigilante Good Samaritan-ism cold-blooded. Before he wastes a roomful of Russian gangsters he looks through the doorway and surveys their lair for the appropriate tools to reap maximal damage most expediently. The camera zeroes in on each object (a corkscrew a lowball glass) and McCall then goes haywire with their deployment (the corkscrew goes up through a chin). But his pulse doesnt seem to rise. He counts down to himself (""twenty-seven one thousand twenty-eight one thousand ..."") and bobs weaves and impales. He offers to take a young hooker off the gangsters hands and is refused. When McCall is done he sits beside the last of his victims and serenely tsk-tsks him All this over nine grand? Washingtons detached serenity is the key to the movie. He doesnt seem crazy. He just seems right. Its the other guys who are like psychos. The hoods McCall kills in that scene work for a Russian oligangster named Pushkin. The media is reporting the incident as a turf-war massacre so Pushkin dispatches his most Bond-style villain -- a demonically tattooed nut named Teddy (Marton Csokas) -- to Boston for a shakedown of the ethnic criminal underworld. Only an Irish American boss gives Teddy lip and more or less loses a mouth. Teddy is McCalls opposite number an easily vexed sadist. We know hes evil because he lurks in a slick new skyscraper that overlooks downtown. McCall lives in an old sparsely furnished walk-up in a blue-collar multiethnic neighborhood. Teddy senses that McCall seems to be highly trained and game recognizing game taps the corrupt cops in his stable (David Harbour is pretty good as one of them) to help him find out who McCall is and what makes him tick. But psychologically McCall isnt wearing a watch.  Eventually with the brief help of two special guest stars scraps of the characters background emerge -- ex-military something or other; a dead wife. The McCall we see is a good friend and colleague. He helps a coworker named Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis) get in shape to pass a physical for a promotion to security guard and offers to help clean up after Ralphies mothers restaurant is trashed. McCall isnt two different people in a comic-book or even a Dr. Jekyll-and-Mr. Hyde sense. His keel remains even whether hes dancing to oldies at work or pushing a drill through somebodys skull. Hes pathologically moral where Teddy is pathologically amoral. The movie is a touch more highfalutin than the show. For whatever reason McCall frequents the same diner where a teenage prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz) is also a regular. She drags herself to the counter. Hes parked in a booth. These scenes are bad on their own. Shes dressed in drum-tight everything can barely walk in her elevator sandals and wears silken wigs with bangs. Its playacting at playacting. With Morgan Freeman-esque grand-paternity he explains to her the lesson of The Old Man and the Sea and she half-absorbs it. Just once Id like for a movie to cut the pretentiousness and do that scene with a copy of Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man or Dianetics. These scenes also seem meant to evoke the paintings of Edward Hopper and the interplay between Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster in Martin Scorsese and Paul Schraders Taxi Driver. But the most evocative allusion is sitting on McCalls shoulders. His planet of a head and its vengeful compartments reminded me of one of the movies most iconic pates Brandos in Apocalypse Now. The Equalizer isnt that movie -- director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day Shooter Olympus Has Fallen) works more directly with almost zero poetry or painterliness. He can give a movie bombast just not Francis Ford Coppolas grandeur. Brandos Kurtz was a defected defective colonel living among indigenous Cambodians and expressing admiration for the Vietcong. But watching McCalls bald head lurk in dark alleys and unlit rooms waiting for a bug to scurry into his web I did remember the explanatory speech General Corman gives to Captain Willard near the beginning of Apocalypse. ""In this war"" Corman says ""things get confused out there power ideals the old morality and practical military necessity. But out there with these natives it must be a temptation to be God. Because theres a conflict in every human heart between the rational and irrational between good and evil. And good does not always triumph. Sometimes the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature."" Coppolas movie was about judgment about the will to ""terminate with extreme prejudice."" It dramatized the thorny business of being human yet behaving inhumanely out of either a dearth of humanity or a perverse excess of it. That discrepancy ought to be the basis for a ring in hell. The Equalizer mines from it an easy crowd-pleasing fantasy of justice whose release falls a few days after our real-life president has adopted a more aggressive tone in foreign policy. This isnt a meditation on vengeance or violence or mankind. Its just men being violent. Fuqua gets off on that. He shoots one strangling from at least five different angles. He replays McCalls massacre as Teddy looks over the crime scene photos. The action sequences are hopped up on all kinds of noise effects and digital scratches. Goosing the slaughter is what Fuquas into but thats all hes into. There is a thrill to Washington in this righteous mode. The movie is like Tony Scotts appalling hit with Washington Man on Fire -- but the man is on ice and by comparison so is the filmmaking. Scotts too-much-is-never-enough approach to action feels like a touchstone for Fuqua who goes from a shot of raw meat to one of cold cash. Hes made an Obama-era blaxploitation picture in one sense -- a polished globalist reasoned defense of a small brownish community from posh white invaders. In another sense its still porn. The two senses come together in a superbly done monologue that Washington delivers in amusement seated at a restaurant. The speech is more effective as an exertion of principled power than the shooting and impaling and drilling that follow. But not unlike the situation with the president elsewhere in the world this is what some people want to see might. McCall is three moves ahead of his targets. (Although its a mystery how he doesnt think to prevent what trips him up during the first finale. In fact its laughable given how out in the open McCall is that no one in Teddys dwindling retinue manages to apprehend or sharpshoot him.) With the vengeance so idealized Fuqua has to find a way to keep us interested. Its not by developing characters. The villains are like a block of Top Ramen Add water and stir. Csokass idea of evil isnt anything new. He spends the movie making the face of a man whos just removed the lid from a boiling pot. I do like what he does with his body though -- not the way hes littered with obvious body art but how he makes himself rigid with confidence and pliable with fear. He cant emote with a part this robotic so he opts for another language modern dance. What Fuqua does is turn up the volume on the crime and the punishment. He luxuriates in both the slaying and his star until both reach a full edge-of-the-seat convergence. I could have done without the barbed-wire noose and glass-shard fight on shattered mirrors. But I couldnt have done without Washington who like Liam Neeson has reached a new cruising altitude as a leading man. (He turns 60 in December; Neeson is 62.) There was a point when violent action films were a trip to the acting ghetto for these two. Neither seemed to enjoy the petulance and righteousness of fighting satanic demons and hunting down psychopaths. Still obliterating crime paid. When those movies were hits (and many of them were) the worry was that neither actor would ever do his respective sort of great acting anymore -- that for Washington whos been doing these junk movies longer and more convincingly than Neeson The Book of Eli and Safe House were going to be all he did. If he wanted a challenge hed find one on the stage. But he and Neeson have found comfort in these persecuted-crime-fighter incarnations of themselves. Washington has never had a problem being a badass. Now he appears to be enjoying it. Thanks in part to his own charisma and to Shonda Rhimes and her addictive bizarre morally inside-out Scandal the culture has changed just enough to embrace a bad character who does so much good that he no longer seems bad. Its anti-antiheroism. By the time McCall has placed his services on the Internet The Equalizer has redefined what it means to be a craigslist killer.  Washington isnt the only actor shattering the rules of what it means to mean to be good. English actor Dan Stevens dons an American accent and a killer smile to play a tightly wound psycho in The Guest. The movie is comprehensively the opposite of The Equalizer. Its shabbiness is a look its jokey mock-1980s-thriller immorality a stance. Stevens plays David a soldier who visits the family of a fallen comrade with whom he served in Afghanistan. The mother (Sheila Kelley) invites him to stay and soon even the more skeptical of the surviving siblings -- a 20-year-old emo-goth named Anna (Maika Monroe) -- lowers her guard. Presently David is beating up the bullies bothering Annas young brother Luke (Brendan Meyer) having sex with her best friend and as McCall does in The Equalizer amassing quite a body count. Annas guard goes right back up and out of nowhere the movie jumps into a parallel plot in which government operatives are panicking about Davids whereabouts. Stevens has a lean generic handsomeness (his hipster ice-cream flavor would be Somebodys Boyfriend) that the movie turns into a joke. He shows up at a party with a keg on his shoulder so that we can see his upper arm bulge. Its the physique equivalent of the sparkling ""ting"" that goes with a close-up of a killer smile. Writer Simon Barrett and director Adam Wingard know what theyre doing. Wingard has control of the mood the shoot-making and the characters stupidity. That said I dont like this movie and I do like it. The Guest is aping bad movies from 25 and 30 years ago (while loading the soundtrack with high-calorie dark wave and electropop). In doing so Wingard and Barrett embrace a lot of whats formally awful about those films without exactly transcending it. As the camera pulls in on David the score starts banging its head against a wall. This might be something that happened in say The Stepfather but that doesnt mean its a good idea to repeat it here. Barrett and Wingard also made the 2013 home-invasion thriller Youre Next which was like the artisanal cheese shop of horror movies. Dont tell me how you sourced your scares just scare me. But the ridiculous sloppiness of 1980s and 90s action thrillers gives the lunacy of The Guest a bouncier springboard. The crazier the movie gets the better it is -- the climax is set in a homemade fun house complete with billowing artificial fog and it works first as comedy then as mild suspense and finally as surprise. Toward the end the filmmakers find their own jokes to tell. They also find Monroe whose side eye dropped jaw and relatable skepticism are masterful. The Guest is another adventure in quotation-mark homage. This time though the marks are sarcastically real (see the first name in the closing credits). That sarcasm is all over the movie and its tricky. Theres no reason for them to take any of this seriously and they dont. But they do care just enough to communicate that they like their winking psycho. So do I. An earlier version of this column misidentified actress Maika Monroe as Maika Moore.

Guess Who Wins? Richard Corliss Sept. 25 2014 SHARE Columbia No Slavic drug lord is safe once the wrath of Denzel is unleashed in this high-voltage high-quality action thriller Soft-spoken Mac (Denzel Washington) pays a visit to the Boston lair of Russian gangster Slavi (David Meunier) with a modest offer 9800 to free young Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) from the grinding abuse she has suffered at the vicious pimps hands. Slavi and his four heavily armed elaborately tattooed henchmen give Macs proposal a big harsh laugh -- their last. In a minute or two of spectacularly choreographed violence that might leave Quentin Tarantino drooling with envy Mac takes out the whole gang with dazzling fisticuffs whirling gunplay and the innovative application of a champagne corkscrew. Slavi should have accepted the 9800 -- not just to stay alive but also to keep the sleeping beast inside Mac from stirring to confront the worldwide Russian mob. Bad as it is for Ukraine the revived reputation of post-Soviet Russia as the worlds most thuggish aggressor state is a boon for action movies. Not since Rosa Klebb of SMERSH took on James Bond in From Russia With Love a half-century ago has Hollywood been able to revel with cause in the villainy of Eastern European tyrants. In director Antoine Fuquas The Equalizer which opens the fall action-film season with a resounding R-rated bang the Moscow-based Mr. Big of the Russian drug cartel is code-named Pushkin; it may as well be Putin. His bad luck the gentleman opposing him is not Barack Obama but Denzel Washington. For much of this exemplary thriller written by Richard Wenk Mac is the quiet friendly employee at Home Mart solicitous of his coworkers and protective of his past. When quizzed about previous employment he says ""I was a Pip"" and mimes not too convincingly the dance steps of a Gladys Knight backup singer. His life is monastic his emotions post-mortem. The films first shot a labyrinthine backwards track from a view of East Boston through Macs obsessively tidy apartment reveals shelves of the hundred great books and little else. At night he reads alone in his flat or in the diner where he met Teri. He has nearly finished The Old Man and the Sea and the viewer may wonder if Washington who turns 60 in Dec. is like Hemingways Santiago ""too old to hook the big fish."" But we wouldnt be invested in Mac -- aka Robert McCall a top government agent living incognito since he ""died"" decades earlier -- if he were to withhold his skills and anger forever. Hes like a bomb of nuclear thrust waiting to be detonated. That one kind gesture to the teenage Teri triggers his old talents and leads to an epic tangle with Pushkins prime enforcer a purring cobra named Teddy (Martin Csokas whose death-mask face suggests a more muscular Kevin Spacey). Every mob in town Russian and Irish along with a cordon of cops on the take wants to kill Mac. The world against one man; that seems fair odds when Washington is The Man. No memories of the 1986 TV series starring Edward Woodward as McCall are needed to enjoy this virulently lively thriller. Fuqua who steered Washington to an Oscar in Training Day creates tension by mixing extreme closeups with elegant tracking shots. The viewer alternately counts beads of sweat on a gunsels face and gets an Old Testament Gods-eye view of a corrupt city thats not too big for one righteous man to bring down or blow up. Macs job and his calling will entwine in a Home Mart showdown to trap Teddy and his gang. As the bad guys storm in the loud-speaker system plays ""Midnight Train to Georgia."" That superstore climax is both dramatically implausible -- Teddy should have brought reinforcements by the hundreds not just a handful to battle the un-take-downable McCall -- and goofily overextended. But it provides a superb showcase for a movie heros abilities both preternatural (hypervision lightning reflexes) and practical (using sand bags and trip wires to trap his foes). It also suits Washington in the dour-deity mode he paraded in his last truly cool film The Book of Eli. Nobody else can bring such coiled menace such glowering intelligence to the simple act of watching. If The Equalizer is the hit it should be it will give this veteran action star his very first movie franchise. In the sequel Denzel-McCall could make things right in Ukraine as Obamas Secretary of Defense and one-man army. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Bush-era intelligence operative who now lives a quiet life until he takes a paternal interest in an abused teenage prostitute. By Peter Rainer Film critic September 26 2014 Save for later Saved The Equalizer stars Denzel Washington. Scott Garfield/Sony - Columbia Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Fans of the mid-1980s TV series ""The Equalizer"" which starred Edward Woodward now have to contend with Denzel Washington in the title role. Robert McCall (Washington) a former George W. Bush-era intelligence operative has retreated to a quiet under-the-radar life working in a Home Mart mega-store. The actor exudes a formidable force field even when hes sipping coffee by himself in an all-night Boston diner that looks like a dead ringer for the one in Edward Hoppers ""Night Hawks.""Robert takes a paternal interest in a teenage prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz) who gets severely roughed up by her pimps in the Russian mob. He goes after them with a cool but unstoppable force. When the Russians send in their top fixer Teddy (Marton Csokas scarily effective) Robert goes after him too. In the unduly gory set pieces Antoine Fuqua who also directed Washington in his Oscar-winning performance in ""Training Day"" borrows a lot from Tarantino and Hong Kong action directors like John Woo. At almost no time is McCall in any real danger despite the parade of thugs and killers and corrupt cops on his trail. His invincibility is Zen-like and also a little silly. This is a kids fantasy of how to be bigger and badder than anybody else. As for Washington no doubt he now has his very own franchise. Grade B- (Rated R for strong bloody violence and language throughout including some sexual references.)

(Scott Garfield) In The Equalizer Denzel Washington has hyper-observant powers and kung-fu movie reflexes McCall.(Scott Garfield) The Equalizer Denzel Washington fights the good fight yet again Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 26 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 26 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Antoine Fuqua Written by Richard Wenk Starring Denzel Washington Marton csokas Chloe Grace Moretz Classification 18A Country USA Language English Denzel Washington turns 60 this year and the release of The Equalizer seems as good a time as any to consider the Meaning of Denzel the screens most prominent African-American leading man of the past 30 years with his reserved manner and stony gaze and disarming overbite. Denzel out there making things more Equal. A sequel to The Equalizer a Sequelizer if you like is already in the works and while Denzel may seem a little mature to be kicking off a new movie franchise theres a current movie vogue for sexagenarians kicking butt Sixty-two-year-old Liam Neeson is planning his third Taken movie next year Pierce Brosnan 61 just did the action flick The November Man and Sly Stallone 68 is still stripping down and strapping on in The Expendables series.Bring on the sequel please because as fine as Denzel is director Antoine Fuquas The Equalizer is not so good - a self-consciously stylized stop-and-start hodgepodge of Death Wish street vengeance Bond-style Russian villainy and moodily shot Boston locale. The movie is adapted from an eighties television series starring English actor Edward Woodward as a kind of modern knight a retired intelligence officer who helps people in trouble which in turn was modelled on the sixties series Have Gun - Will Travel.Giving Denzel two meshing sides to his persona - the reserved and noble and the calculating and violent - is a good fit.The most important part of the adaptation is that the hero Robert McCalls social status has been downgraded.In the adaptation by Richard Wenk (16 Blocks The Expendables 2) Robert works as a companionable employee at a Home Depot-style box store where hes a good buddy with the other staff and rides the bus (Woodwards Robert McCall drove a Jag). Robert is a widower who lives in a stripped-down apartment and shows certain obsessive-compulsive tendencies (a routine with a teabag) and cant sleep at night. He goes to a diner straight out of an Edward Hopper painting occupies the same booth and reads a series of thematically on-the-nose great books Hemingways The Old Man and the Sea Cervantess Don Quixote Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man.His well-controlled isolation ends when he takes a paternal interest in a teenaged prostitute named Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz referencing Jodie Fosters wardrobe in Taxi Driver). One evening Teri is taken away by her Russian pimp and ends up in hospital after a beating then mostly disappears from the film. Robert decides to track down the culprits in the escort service they run above a restaurant.He meets with five of them and meekly asks if he can pay them to get Teri out of prostitution and of course they mock him. Heavy violence ensues involving sharp objects and we realize Robert has hyperobservant powers and kung-fu movie reflexes and leaves the Russians hideout looking like it has been hit with a borscht bomb.And the battle is on. The Russian gangsters who also seem to control most of the Boston police force are naturally concerned. They call on their most lethal assassin named of course ""Teddy"" (Marton Csokas) a sharp-dressing psychopath who assembles an army to get rid of this pesky hardware store employee.As Robert recognizes that hes into something deep he calls on some highly placed friends (Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman) for help - and we finally get the lowdown on Roberts previous life. In saving one teenaged prostitute it seems Robert has upset the highest echelons of Russian crime an oligarch coyly named Vladimir Pushkin.In this extended bloody game of cat and mouse (think The Simpsons Itchy and Scratchy) theres never any sense that Washingtons character is in any real jeopardy or that the Russian criminals are much more than so much splatter-fodder. Yet there are pleasures here mostly in watching Washingtons psychological gamesmanship which is another way of saying acting.Roberts race is never mentioned in The Equalizer but theres a telling restaurant scene where Robert echoes Teddys question back to him ""What do you see when you look at me?""The answer for Robert is a working-class middle-aged black man something like the ""invisible man"" of Ellisons 1952 novel. Hes not someone you expect to have super-perception or James Bond connections. Which brings us back to the meaning of Denzel.Washington who cut his teeth on Broadway in the African-American theatre boom of the late seventies became famous in the 1980s with a supporting role for six seasons on the critically-praised St. Elsewhere. Handsome reserved and shyly flirtatious Washington capitalized on his TV exposure with a series of racially-sensitive ""important"" roles including his Oscar-winning turn in Glory in the apartheid drama Cry Freedom and in a familiar inner-city principal film Hard Lessons. In the process he emerged as his generations leading African-American actor handsome enough to be considered the heir to Sidney Poitier (whom he consulted for career advice). A key turning point was Spike Lees Mo Better Blues (1990) as a self-centred two-timing jazz musician Bleek Gilliam (modelled on trumpeter Miles Davis). The church-going reserved Washington found some aspects of the role outside his comfort zone - he and Lee clashed over the sex scenes - but Lee predicted accurately that ""this role will free Denzel from playing these great heroic stoic types."" (Tellingly Washington followed the part immediately by starring in the title role of Richard III directed by Joseph Papp.) Lees Malcolm X showed Washingtons full range fiery and cool at once but his most successful calculation came in choosing to play significant supporting roles in mainstream films opposite white stars Reporter Gray Grantham in the screen version of The Pelican Brief opposite Julia Roberts and then as the homophobic lawyer Joe Miller who takes on the wrongful dismissal case of AIDS patient Andrew Beckett (Tom Hanks) in Jonathan Demmes Philadelphia and a co-starring performance with Gene Hackman in the action thriller Crimson Tide.Of his work in the late nineties Norman Jewisons The Hurricane (1999) about Reuben (Hurricane) Carters fight for freedom after being twice convicted for a triple murder was probably Washingtons best shot at an Oscar. Unfortunately for Washington the film ran up against a vigorous anti-Oscar backlash from those who believed Carter was guilty. His Oscar reward came two years later with Fuquas Training Day as Detective Alonzo Harris an L.A. cop gone seriously rogue.Training Day was the first truly malevolent character in Washingtons career and an important breakthrough.In the current century through his middle years Washington has mixed it up smartly balancing the good-guy inspirational parts (The Great Debaters Remember the Titans) against those complicated anti-hero roles - American Gangster Man on Fire Safe House and Flight.With The Equalizer he has found a place where his noble side the knight without armour the rescuer of the downtrodden can meet the guy who likes inflicting some pain and playing head games on those who underestimate him. So chalk The Equalizer up to a shaky start. More and better Equalizers will be welcome just to watch Denzel finding new ways of getting even.

Scott Garfield/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Scott Garfield/Sony Pictures Denzel Washington stars as a retired intelligence officer in The Equalizer. Scott Garfield/Sony Pictures ""A feud is this way"" Mark Twain wrote in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. ""A man has a quarrel with another man and kills him; then that other mans brother kills him; then the other brothers on both sides goes for one another; then the cousins chip in -- and by and by everybodys killed off and there aint no more feud. But its kind of slow and takes a long time."" Thats a different Twain quote from the one that appears onscreen at the top of The Equalizer the Zen vigilante flick reuniting Training Day director and star Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington. But its a better fit for the surprisingly patient unsurprisingly violent movie theyve made. Like their prior collaboration it scrapes together two gripping closely observed acts before lobotomizing itself for an over-the-top final third that tips the needle from ""Pleasure"" to ""Pleasure Guilty Shame on You"" I liked the lengthy first act where Washington walks the Earth - well part of Boston - dispensing inspiration and literary analysis of great novels hes read and dietary advice even better than the (longer) part where hes dispensing justice. Your mileage may vary. From its Edward Woodward-starring 80s CBS primetime forebear The Equalizer has inherited a title and vague premise - retired covert-ops badass uses Murderous Jedi Skills to help the meek - but not unfortunately Police drummer Stewart Copelands New Wave theme music. The pictures soundtrack runs more to Eminem and - since were already talking about dirty little crime pictures buffed and polished and inflated to portentous scale -- the same Moby song Michael Mann used to introduce Al Pacino and Robert De Niros historic tete-a-tete in Heat 19 years ago. The film around it remains a hummable easy-to-digest entry in a long line of monastic plainclothes superhero flicks about penitent and unknowable widowers. (Sidebar When did the celibacy thing become pervasive in action movies? Is it because of PG-13 creep or because the median age of our action leads has shot up by 20 years?) Liam Neeson has played minor variations on this Sad Jedi role even more times than Washington. But Washington is even better at it and of course he has not one but two Oscar statuettes he can reach for when he needs a makeshift weapon. Is he overqualified for The Equalizer? Are you saying that just because this movie wouldve starred Steven Seagal back when Washington was playing Malcolm X for Spike Lee but would otherwise have differed little from the version were watching in 2014? (Washingtons character McCall even brings his own teabags to the all-night diner where he hangs out reading leatherbound classics when he cant sleep furtively tossing them in his cup the instant before the waiter pours his hot water. Cool odd little detail. Never remarked upon. Feels Seagalian. Hes also apparently OCD continually rearranging the utensils on the table.) Deservedly or not the movie is elevated several echelons by Washingtons Father Knows Best (How to Kill Slimeballs) performance. Gravitas hes got. Also grave-itas. The details of his former life as a spook are wisely left vague All we know - and we get this from behavior not exposition - is that hes a meticulous solitary soul who goes out of his way to be kind and helpful. The kids at the big-box hardware store where he works call him ""Pops"" and use YouTube to fact-check his claim that he sang backup for Gladys Knight. When he catches the colleague hes helping to lose weight sneaking some chips he speaks not a critical word; he just gives a reproachful look and says hes looking for ""Progress not perfection."" Youd want this guy in your corner... ... even if you didnt already know from the trailer that he can stroll into a den of armed thugs read their neck tattoos like a barcode scanner and predict within a few seconds how long its going to take him to slay them all no two in the same way. Dont feel bad for them; theyre Russian sex traffickers who beat Elena -- the sad-eyed teenage prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz) who sometimes talks to McCall at the diner -- near to death. If anybody has a bullet (corkscrew shot glass ashtray) karmically coming their way its these jerkazoids. Because he has renounced violence McCall actually tries to buy Elenas freedom first. But the slavers refuse so its back to the Corkscrew/Shot Glass/Ashtray Plan. This confrontation is a great tense scene one the movie builds to for 35 minutes. But like Travis Bickle before him once McCall uncorks his inner bully-of-bullies he cant stop him. Soon hes even taking on crooked cops beating them up and blackmailing them into returning the protection money theyve extorted from a restaurant - along with an apology. This is a decency-enforcing Dockers-wearing superhero we can all get behind. The movie comes to revel in its shorthand When a stickup guy at the hardware store demands a cashiers wedding ring along with the money a shot of Denzel replacing a slightly used mallet on the shelf tells the entire story of how she gets it back. Better still is when a henchman gets up from a restaurant table and then McCall appears a moment later take his place tossing the mans bloodied broken sunglasses on the table in front of him. Sic semper those guys who wear sunglasses indoors The Equalizer is a lot of fun for as long as it sticks to its modern-western guns and tells an intimate story. But like almost every action film it inflates to prepostrous dimensions and our investment in it declines accordingly. (This visually unspectacular crime movie all night shots and close-ups is getting a pointless IMAX release.) The pimps McCall kills cant just be pimps naturally; theyre the bottom rungs of a vast international criminal conspiracy. Occupying a slighty higher rung is Marton Csokas playing the heavy sent from Russia to deliver McCalls head. Hes a guy from New Zealand born to Hungarian and Australian parents playing a Russian which may explain why he sounds like hes channeling Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds. His foreplay with Washington is superb. When the pair is face-to-face for the first time Washington pretends to be a meek shut-in and Csokas pretends to be a cop. Neither man buys the others story but theres a tacit agreement among these professional killers briefly to sustain the fiction. The scene crackles with energy; its great fun. Savoring the weirdness of these relatively quiet moments is the key to enjoying The Equalizer. It runs out of clever moves before it runs out of movie but at least it doesnt go dull when it goes dumb setting its final showdown in McCalls hardware store. The Book of Isiah tells us to beat our swords into ploughshares. Which is presumably why McCall dispatches the last four or five wicked men who come for him using various gardening and home improvement implements even though theres an entire franchise-in-the-makings worth of firearms just lying there on the floor.

Neither man one could argue has been quite the same since. Washington remains an A-list star but has made a series of largely forgettable action vehicles and inspirational sagas; his best two roles of the last decade have come in Spike Lees ""Inside Man"" and Robert Zemeckis ""Flight"" but only the first of those stands up to more than one viewing. Fuqua is a master manipulator of style and atmosphere who has often chosen (or gotten stuck with) mediocre material or worse I have a soft spot for his back-to-basics cop opera ""Brooklyns Finest"" but his best movie since ""Training Day"" is probably ""Shooter"" with Mark Wahlberg. (I had totally forgotten that Fuqua directed a King Arthur film starring Clive Owen and theres a reason for that.)Now the Washington-Fuqua duo is back together for ""The Equalizer"" a synthetic blend of sentimental fantasy and Nietzschean supercop-revenge saga based on the all-but-forgotten 1980s TV series with British star Edward Woodward. This is an entirely different kind of movie than ""Training Day"" and far less ambitious in narrative terms but its a triumph in its own brooding ultraviolent and faux-meaningful fashion. If that sounds like Im recommending ""The Equalizer"" and then trying to take it back thats exactly right. Its not quite that I think this movie is a guilty pleasure since ""pleasure"" is hardly the applicable term. ""The Equalizer"" is gripping mysterious and even sometimes moving but its never pleasant still less fun. If you decide to go dont claim you werent warned. If you skip it youre missing one of the years signal works of superior Hollywood craftsmanship.Fuqua builds considerable suspense from the near-silent opening scenes onward and then delivers a series of grotesque and imaginative killings all in entirely formulaic fashion. What isnt formulaic is the persistent David Fincher mood of nightmare - the sense that were in an imaginary universe related to our own but not quite the same - and the iconic stillness and loneliness of Denzel Washington. Every director whos ever worked with Washington black or white has taken advantage of his unusual combination of good looks and inwardness his slightly standoffish demeanor that sense that hes carrying things around that we should not presume to try to understand. It might be a cliche to suggest that an African-American filmmaker like Fuqua sees the stars visage in a different light but theres no question that in their two movies together Fuqua has homed in on Washingtons face with a ruthless intensity. (Both ""The Equalizer"" and ""Training Day"" were shot by master cinematographer Mauro Fiore.)Washington will turn 60 later this year and Fuqua makes him look grayer and older than ever before subtly but noticeably diminished in scale from the superstar of 15 or 20 year ago. His character Robert McCall lives alone dresses in conservative American-guy drag - button-down shirts and relaxed-fit slacks - and spends his workdays pushing a dolly around inside a Home Depot-like big-box store in Boston. (Only Washington could look this good at this age in a wardrobe purchased off the rack at J.C. Penney.) But we can tell that something about the guy doesnt fit. Well OK we can tell that because we showed up to see an action movie called ""The Equalizer"" which for almost half an hour has no action in it whatever. Robert barely sleeps and spends his nights at a 24-hour diner drinking tea working his way through a list of classic literature and making small talk with a Russian hooker who calls herself Teri or sometimes Ilena (Chloe Grace Moretz). When we first meet him hes reading ""The Old Man and the Sea"" and by the end of the film hes gone through ""Don Quixote"" to ""Invisible Man"" and I suppose those function as narrative cues. You Might Also Like Honestly Id have been just fine if ""The Equalizer"" never abandoned its brooding late-night Wong Kar-wai-does-Edward Hopper mode. Then it would be some other kind of movie and not this one where Teri/Ilenas overly tattooed and ludicrously coiffed pimp (David Meunier) finally runs afoul of McCall by roughing her up one too many times. McCall actually shows up with cash to buy Ilena from her captors only to be ridiculed in Russian (which of course he understands) and you probably understand how that scene ends. Beneath McCalls mild tragic lumber-guy surface there beats of course the heart of a ninja super-spy assassin not so secretly yearning to kick Russkie tail (and drive household implements into Russkie eyeballs). Neither Fuqua nor screenwriter Richard Wenk could have predicted an old-school international crisis in 2014 that pits Russia and America against each other presumably but its fair to say that ""The Equalizer"" captures a mood of Cold War redux that was already in the air.Its certainly possible to read too much into this films racial politics; the fact that McCall is black is mentioned only once pretty much in passing (the character was white in the TV show). But Washingtons color has never been irrelevant in his career and the specifics of this particular jingoistic fantasy - a semi-retired black man in dad clothes taking down the bling-laden Uzi-toting metrosexual meatheads of the Russian mob all by himself - are rife with psychoanalytic potential. McCall is like a vision of classic American manhood telegraphed from the past and translated into a multicultural idiom. He knows his way around lumber power tools firearms and superhero-grade martial arts and if you put your hands on a woman he will make you pay by gum. Hes like the single-handed cure for everything thats wrong with America from the international hatred and humiliation to the ""crisis of masculinity"" to the racial incomprehension to the confusion about the scale and consequences of violence against women. That cure is some kind of government-trained human killing machine of course and so in objective terms not all that reassuring. But hey a heros gotta come from somewhere. So the general tone of ""The Equalizer"" is already pretty weird even before veteran movie villain Marton Csokas shows up in the nemesis role of Teddy an ex-KGB psychopath who resembles an evil version of James Bond from that alternate universe where Mr. Spock has a goatee. He has an unplaceable accent a Savile Row wardrobe and even scarier tattoos than the regular Russian criminals and he and his band of hirsute malefactors have a final showdown with McCall inside the non-Home Depot store that ranks among the grandest set-pieces in recent action-movie history. All of this takes place in a corrupt and enslaved version of Boston and America that appears to have been sucked dry of color and life by giant vampires; its partly the city where Neo works in ""The Matrix"" and partly the Gotham of the ""Dark Knight"" series.I dont know how far into late middle age Washington wants to pursue this character or whether the dark magic that makes this mendacious and parasitical film appear to thrum with subterranean meaning can be repeated. Theres clearly potential for a franchise here but one assumes itll be a franchise based on the lethal use of kitchen implements and retail hardware not on the surreal loneliness of its main character. But thats where the moral and psychological truth of ""The Equalizer"" lies not in the infantile fantasy payback that will restore Americas global dominance and reassert the imaginary urban order of 40 or 50 or 60 years ago but in a man sitting alone with an old book as a haunting old song plays from somewhere and the world around him fades into night into nothing.

But ""The Equalizer"" hasnt just been rebooted its been recalled and totally factory re-built. The original 80s show starred Edward Woodward as a tight-lipped trenchcoated ex-CIA man who drove a Jag and mercilessly rid Manhattan of lowlifes. The new movie stars Denzel Washington as a tightlipped ex-CIA man with OCD who takes the bus works at a big-box hardware store and rids Boston of lowlifes. So we still have the Agency background and the vigilantism. But some of the old-school polish and raw macho has been worn off. (Washington hands out empowering slogans and dietary advice for heavens sake. Woodward looked like he subsisted on a bad mood and gin martinis.) Its still a competent enough directed with some style by Antoine Fuqua who did Washingtons ""Training Day"" (and then went on to overbudgeted and underperforming films like ""Tears of the Sun"" and ""Olympus Has Fallen""). He provides some eyecatching shots and a well-staged final confrontation (although the hand-to-hands are typically too fast and confusing). And Washington remains endlessly watchable. But the movie still feels a little cliched in spots and awful gimmicky in others. The corniness comes courtesy of the villains a gang of Russian mobsters who seem to have taken over the entire Boston underworld. They knock back vodka do business under icons and sport more tattoos than a Wildwood boardwalk. The gimmickry arises from that fact that Washingtons character seems to have something against firearms. Mostly he uses objects as weapons -- mallets barbed-wire shards of glass cordless drills. (Guns dont kill people. Nail-guns kill people.) Perhaps thats the films conscious pseudo-PC choice -- not to have its hero relying on an automatic (although he does pick one up occasionally). Certainly Fuqua is comfortable with upping the political stakes here having Washington not only take on corrupt white cops but first give them the chance to ""do the right thing."" That boldness is surprising in a way we havent seen in thrillers since the ""Shaft"" remake when Samuel L. Jackson took out similar bad officers with a snarled ""Its Giuliani time."" But the rest of the quirks -- like Washingtons OCD habits -- never become more than quirks and his inhuman superiority (he goes into a room full of half-a-dozen murderers unarmed -- and walks out of a room of half-a-dozen corpses unharmed) feels like sub-par ""Bourne."" Apart from Washington theres not to much to catch the eye here. Marton Csokas is the chief villain -- you can tell hes a sociopath because he wears lovely clothes and has nice manners -- but his accent seems to be lost somewhere between Russia and New Zealand. Chloe Grace Moretz drifts in and out as a Slavic streetwalker. Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo show up for no good reason whatsoever and poor David Harbour who just got roughed up by Liam Neeson in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" gets tenderized here again by Washington. Like ""Tombstones"" this is a similar angry middle-aged avenger movie all done by formula -- insert Fist A into Face B - and aimed strictly at the AARP audience. Which is fine -- so was ""Taken."" But that was six years ago. And since then this mini-genre has begun to feel more and more expendable. Ratings note The film contains strong language and violence The Equalizer (R) Sony (128 min.)

"Review All things being Equalizer art elevates films brutality - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review All things being Equalizer art elevates films brutality Equalizer makes a terrific if entirely too long Denzel vehicle Scott Garfield / MCT Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) and McCall (Denzel Washington) in ""The Equalizer."" Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) and McCall (Denzel Washington) in ""The Equalizer."" (Scott Garfield / MCT) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua lift The Equalizer above its mayhem-based genre When star Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua collaborated on 2001s ""Training Day"" the film won Washington an Oscar and changed the trajectory of his career. Now comes Act 2 ""The Equalizer"" a tense thriller that also has more on its mind than the familiar genre constraints it operates under.Unapologetic in its excessive frequently grotesque violence ""The Equalizer"" takes advantage of its star-director pairing to elevate its all-too-recognizable story of a man willing to do what it takes to even the odds for the worlds beleaguered underdogs. In Fuqua here collaborating again with Oscar-winning cinematographer Mauro Fiore ""The Equalizer"" has a filmmaker with a vivid sense of style someone who enjoys putting the mechanics of action on film and doesnt shy away from the operatic visual flourish.In Washington of course ""The Equalizer"" has an exceptional actor who seldom puts a foot wrong and adds heft and substance to familiar characters without even seeming to try. Inspired by the 1980s TV show starring Edward Woodward and working from an at-times effective script by Richard Wenk Fuqua and Washington share a desire to give the main character equal footing with the expected mind-numbing violence. This has led to an excessive 2-hour 11-minute length but it pays off in the end. In [Denzel] Washington ... The Equalizer has an exceptional actor who seldom puts a foot wrong. Though its clear from the advertising and the trailer that this ""Equalizer"" will be focusing on kicking ass and taking names its a measure of the films ambitions that a full half-hour passes before it allows itself to show its violent colors.That time is spent carefully introducing Robert McCall (Washington) a seemingly ordinary Boston resident who works at a Home Depot clone called Home Mart. Invariably courteous and helpful he never passes up a chance to encourage his co-workers especially the overweight Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis) with a wide range of positive-thinking aphorisms. The Equalizer trailer Denzel Washington stars in ""The Equalizer."" Denzel Washington stars in ""The Equalizer."" See more videos McCalls only leisure time activity seems to be reading classic novels and coming up with platitudes about them that are predictive of where the plot will soon be going. ""Hes a knight in a world where knights dont exist anymore"" McCall says of ""Don Quixote"" and ""youve got to be who you are in this world no matter what"" is his reaction to ""The Old Man and the Sea."" If you say so. There are other signs that McCall is not completely ordinary. For one thing he is meticulous to the point of compulsiveness about the details of his life like carefully wrapping an unused tea bag in a napkin before heading out to the Edward Hopperesque all-night diner he frequents when he cant sleep which is always.Its at the diner that McCall habitually runs into Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz largely wasted) a twitchy underage Russian hooker whose hard-knock life arouses enough sympathy in the man that he attempts to reason with the bad guys to set her free. When they dont listen McCall no surprise is not at a loss for other options.For it is not giving away anything to say that underneath his bland exterior McCall unleashed is one of those only-in-the-movies ultimate killing machines the worlds deadliest Boy Scout able to create the kind of mayhem with a corkscrew that Robert Parker would never condone.The main question in a film like ""The Equalizer"" is whether a worthy adversary can be conjured up to take on the bloody mayhem the hero creates. In this case the violence attracts the attention of heavily tattooed psychotic Russian mob enforcer Teddy (Marton Csokas looking like Kevin Spacey after he sold his soul to the devil) described as ""a sociopath with a business card"" and the kind of admiring enemy who looks at McCalls work and says ""I have rarely seen skills like this.""Most of ""The Enforcer"" is taken up with the violent cat-and-mouse game Teddy (whose idea of sending a message is beating someone to death) and McCall play as each tries to figure exactly who the other person is.Teri all but disappears from the scene as ""The Equalizer"" -- echoing Clint Eastwoods brilliant ""Unforgiven"" -- increasingly focuses on how irresistible the lure of violence is for those whove indulged in it in the past. Now that McCall is off the wagon it will come as no surprise that an ""Equalizer 2"" is in the works.Twitter KennethTuran---------------------------------The EqualizerMPAA rating R for strong bloody violence and language throughout including some sexual referencesRunning time 2 hours 11 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Column Action (Movie Genre) Denzel Washington Kevin Spacey Read more movie reviews gt;gt; Antoine Fuqua Denzel Washington reteam for The Equalizer Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-mn-the-equalizer-review-20140926-column.html?track=rss,200,theequalizer13,theequalizer,latimes

BOTTOM LINE Even Washington cant rise above this dopey reboot of the 1980s television show. CAST Denzel Washington Chloe Grace Moretz Marton Csokas LENGTH 211 If you were a fan of junk television in the 1980s you probably remember Robert McCall hero of CBS ""The Equalizer"" a skilled and shadowy figure devoted to helping out distressed damsels and honest working folk. Like so much the networks offered back then the show was pure hokum -- in one episode McCall stabs Adam Ant -- but it did have a steely edge thanks to its star Edward Woodward a British actor whose intensity helped sell the phony action scenes. What could be gained by adapting that old show to todays big screen? Theoretically quite a lot. Directed by Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") with a hard R rating the movie can do things the FCC would never have allowed. And with a formidable actor like Denzel Washington as McCall youve got at least the makings of a solid action film. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""The Equalizer"" is the origin story of McCall a humble Bostonian working at a home-improvement store and trying to forget his violent past (Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo play his former intelligence-agency handlers). At the local diner McCall befriends a young prostitute Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) and paternally encourages her to ""change your world."" When Teris pimp puts her in the hospital however McCall puts his old skills to use. Thats a delicious-sounding recipe for macho fantasy but Fuquas movie is just as dopey and creaky as the series. The violence is bloodier but no more believable -- can you really kill someone with a shot glass? -- and Washingtons sly intelligence seems wasted on dozens of slow-moving dim-bulb thugs. Speaking of villains these cold war cutouts could be rejects from the series Marton Csokas plays a tattooed Russian named Teddy and his boss is called Pushkin. Making ""The Equalizer"" truly groan-worthy are its many subplots each a tidy little episode with a heartwarming ending. (Richard Wenk wrote the script.) Aside from a new cast and a closing rap track from Eminem -- theres no trace of Stewart Copelands original synth-driven theme song -- you can barely tell this hokey new movie from the hokey old show. 240 MoviesThe Equalizer trailer PLOT A former CIA agent decides to help a troubled girl. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (violence language) CAST Denzel Washington Chloe Grace Moretz Marton Csokas LENGTH 211 BOTTOM LINE Even Washington cant rise above this dopey reboot of the 1980s television show.

"The Equalizer keeps Denzel on the clock and on the money review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Equalizer keeps Denzel on the clock and on the money reviewDenzel Washingtons powerful presence draws us into the comic book violence of The Equalizer which reunites him with his Training Day director Antoine Fuqua.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Sept. 25 2014The EqualizerStarring Denzel Washington Chloe Grace Moretz and Marton Csokas. Directed by Antoine Fuqua. At GTA theatres. 132 minutes. 18ADenzel Washingtons powerful presence drags us into the comic book violence of The Equalizer which reunites him with his Training Day director Antoine Fuqua.Were given precious little story (or back story) from screenwriter Richard Wenk (The Expendables 2) but not much is needed for a tale this primal and an actor this watchable. Article Continued BelowLean forceful and completely convincing Washington redeems what would otherwise be generic genre trash explaining why this movie recently had its gala world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.Denzel Washington is a man with a past in The Equalizer.  (Scott Garfield)  Washingtons vigilante loner character former spy Robert McCall actually originates from 1980s TV rather than graphic novels but the latter somehow feels more likely.This version of McCall is considerably more cartoonish than Edward Woodwards televised original. So much so you may wonder why the frames arent separated by white panels or why Sin Citys Frank Miller or Watchmens Alan Moore arent somehow involved.McCall lives alone in a blue-collar Boston neighbourhood his past one of shadows and secrets his present one of plain living and public transit. Employed as a stock clerk in a big-box hardware depot hes a friendly and steady older hand in a place that gives him access to and familiarity with all kinds of tools. Hes a man of the clock and of habit the kind of guy who puts a stopwatch to everything. This includes as well soon see the extremely rough but precisely timed justice he administers to whomever he catches preying upon the weak and innocent in a hood where the cops are as dirty as the crooks. Hes never the first one to start a fight however.McCall has a nightly ritual of taking herbal tea and reading classic literature in a 24-hour diner one that looks like Edward Hoppers Nighthawks dive. His current tome is Hemingways The Old Man and the Sea in which a solitary fisherman has to deal with a lot of sharks.He befriends young Russian hooker Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) who works for some very bad tattooed dudes who look as if they walked out of David Cronenbergs Eastern Promises. Theyre bossed by charismatic hit man Teddy (Marton Csokas) who looks and acts like a Russian version of Kevin Spacey and who represents Moscow kingpin Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich).A line is crossed when Teri ends up in hospital near death. McCall feels the call to action and retribution ""You do something about it because you can."" You know whats coming but first McCall has to pay a visit to his former bosses in ""The Agency"" which we take to be the CIA. Played by Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman theyre on the screen so briefly it seems almost a waste to have them in the picture (although maybe they get more screen time in The Equalizer 2 which has already been green-lighted).You could say something similar about Washington -- why is this two-time Oscar winner headlining a film that is little more than popcorn diversion?Hes of course no stranger to playing butt kickers in such films as Man On Fire and The Book of Eli. But this time he seems to be taking his cue from fellow mid-career lion Liam Neeson who has recently turned pulp into gold with his Taken franchise and similar action fare. Fuqua and cinematographer Mauro Fiore draw visual blood from Asian cinema with its midnight aspect slo-mo violence and rain-soaked denouement -- although the waterworks here come from a buildings fire sprinklers.A franchise is born but lets hope they come up with better stories for the sequels. Washingtons McCall already has all the motivation he needs.As he told Teri ""You got to be who you are in this world right? No matter who you are.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

He can do more with a move a head tilt a shot of fire in the eye than most actors do with pages of dialogue. Thats a star baby. Washington drives The Equalizer an updated ultraviolent take on the 1980s TV series starring Edward Woodward. Now its Washingtons turn to step into the role of retired special-ops agent Robert McCall. He uses a job at a Boston Home Depot-like store as a cover while he heaps rough justice on criminal scum. More News Alt-Fall Movie Preview The Best of the Rest Fall Movie Preview Finally the Good Stuff All Stories >> The material shows its age when McCall goes all Taxi Driver to save a teen hooker (a scrappy Chloe Grace Moretz) from her pimps. But Washington and director Antoine Fuqua who teamed for the actors Oscar-winning role in 2001s Training Day keep the action humming. The film runs long at 131 minutes but the takedown of a psycho Russian fixer (Marton Csokas) is sweet agony and Washington as ever is the essence of cool.

Sony Pictures Sony Pictures Sony Pictures The Equalizer     (out of five) Director Antoine Fuqua Cast Denzel Washington Marton Csokas Chloe Grace Moretz Rated R (strong bloody violence and strong language throughout including some sexual references) Running time 131 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 538pm on Thursday Sep. 25 2014 Thursday Sep. 25 2014 Thursday Sep. 25 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Denzel Washington must have been behind Liam Neeson in the line at the bank and glimpsed when the Irish actor deposited one of his massive checks from Taken.Washington wanting a cut of that late-career tough-guy action would help explain his presence in The Equalizer a straightforward revenge-action vehicle and update of the 80s TV series -- as well as the possible kick-off for a franchise -- that could very easily have starred Jason Statham and no one would have been the wiser.Yet just having Washington in the title role elevates the film from a tired rerun -- complete with (yawn) brutal Russian mobsters and their inept gunmen who couldnt hit the side of the Kremlin -- to a rousing crowd-pleasing take on a movie formula like a forgettable pop song turned into a dizzying jazz solo.On the television show Robert McCall a.k.a The Equalizer (British actor Edward Woodward) was a dapper defender of justice a former agent who helped everyday people fight back against those taking advantage of them. Here Washingtons McCall is very different. A loner with a mysterious past who lives by himself in a small Boston apartment he works at a big-box home-improvement store by day and reads literature -- hes working his way through a list of the 100 best books -- at a table in a local diner by night. When we meet him hes deep into Hemingways The Old Man and the Sea.This is where he makes the acquaintance of another patron Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz If I Stay) the prototypical hooker with a heart of gold and ambitions to be a singer. But shes under the heavy thumb of a well-connected group of crime lords run by Slavi (David Meunier) who beats her so badly one night that shes sent to ICU.Faster than you can say ""avenging angel on aisle one"" McCall takes it upon himself to take out her employers -- and that puts him on the radar of Slavis overlords specifically Teddy (a deliciously evil Marton Csokas) who has flown in from Moscow specifically to deal with the situation.Washington is magnetic as McCall imbuing his just-get-the-job-done guy-next-door character with a sense of solid moral righteousness and swaggering physical authority; hes Batman and hes employee of the month.All the while Washington provides McCall a loose-limbed humanity. When he breaks into a bit of Gladys Knight amp; the Pips choreography while joshing around with his co-workers its tough to imagine the intense Neeson or the buttoned-up Woodward pulling that one off.Director Antoine Fuqua ( Olympus Has Fallen Training Day) working from the predictable script by Richard Wenk ( The Expendables 2 The Mechanic) possesses a flashy authority and he injects a sense of energy by using tricks he learned as a brand-name music-video director -- take for example the ""rain"" scene in the climax.Perhaps the most intriguing element in the way McCall has been reimagined is that Washingtons race is not an issue. He never brings it up and the myriad of foul-mouthed gangsters and corrupt cops never use it as an epithet.At one point though McCall is seen reading Invisible Man Ralph Ellisons classic 1952 vision of what its like to be black in America. Its a nice touch saying what has been unsaid while also echoing McCalls life as the unassuming working stiff who just happens to have a hidden life as a courageous crime-fighter. The Equalizer may not be a smart movie but the filmmakers were smart enough to score Washington. Some actors it turns out are more equal than others.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday September 25 2014 Follow AnnHornaday Anyone ancient enough to remember when ""The Equalizer"" was a terrific prime-time procedural -- and to have harbored special feelings for Denzel Washington since his days on ""St. Elsewhere"" -- will understand when I describe Antoine Fuquas big-screen adaptation of the show as an exercise in missed opportunities. Now nearing 60 Washington is a credible even inspired choice to play Robert McCall here a clerk at a Boston big box home construction store whose banal working-stiff persona belies a darker more shadowy past. Like Liam Neeson whose late-in-life action career has given so many appealing actors a second chapter to which to aspire Washington carries with him not just native sex appeal and charisma but also decades worth of audience goodwill. The role of McCall -- who leads a spartan monklike existence and goes out of his way to help his co-workers (when hes not expertly deflecting their curiosity about where he came from) -- fits Washington like a supple comfortably worn glove. So far so good even when McCall strikes up a friendship with a teenage prostitute named Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) who shares his penchant for late-night chats at a corner diner. It takes only one or two of these encounters to establish both characters soulful high-minded bona fides with McCall ostentatiously reading ""The Old Man and the Sea"" (in hardcover) over his ascetic cup of tea while advising the waiflike Teri an aspiring pop singer to lay off white sugar in order to maintain her vocal cords. Fuqua goes out of his way to stage these scenes as reenactments of Edward Hoppers ""Nighthawks"" right down to the sulfuric green-and-yellow color scheme. But soon the former music video director reverts to stylistic form abandoning any pretense of restraint or artistic subtlety in favor of pulpy hyperbole. It turns out that Hemingway hardcover isnt just a literary talisman but also a convenient weapon a dual use McCall manages to find in everything from a common screwdriver to a hedge clipper. What sends McCall on his vigilante mission to weaponize everyday appliances -- culminating in an outlandish overlong climax that can only be described as Death by Home Depot -- is an inciting incident as trite as it is offensive an unspeakable act of violence against a female character in this case a girl whos been hyper-sexualized not just by her victimizing pimp but by extension the filmmakers as well. The very real crime of sex trafficking is thus extruded through the filmmakers toxic imaginations into an obliquely titillating excuse for McCall to go on a violent rampage -- the more stylized mannered and grotesque the better. 1 of 16 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Denzel Washington Life as a leading man View Photos In roles ranging from ""Glory"" to ""American Gangster"" the Oscar-winning actor has had a long and successful career.

Columbia Pictures/Photofest Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. As for Teri shes folded up and put away once her two-dimensional role has been fulfilled only to reappear just as perfunctorily for a pat self-congratulatory example of a cinematic bow-tying ceremony. In between Fuqua sends McCall on a lone chivalric journey through a generic-looking Boston being terrorized by a Russian mob that in ""The Equalizer"" has apparently moved in where Whitey Bulger left off. A visit to a former colleague (played by Melissa Leo) provides a moment of respite -- and the intriguing possibility of a genuinely substantive plot twist -- but soon enough the film resumes its chief aim which is to find a way for Washington to dispatch as many Russian baddies with as much imaginative bloodletting as possible. For Fuqua everything looks better underneath a moody scrim of rain here duly supplied by a cooperative fire alarm system. For all of ""The Equalizers"" overkill Washington retains an admirable air of seriousness embodying McCall as a believable figure of purity and protection even when hes going after his opponents with methodical thoughtfully choreographed sadism. But finally -- and at over two hours finally is a longtime coming -- even Washingtons handsomely reassuring screen presence cant keep ""The Equalizer"" from being another preposterous but somehow also bland exercise in predictability and fetishistic carnage. In another movie Washingtons McCall might have been the beginning of a promising new franchise. But even drenched in blood and fake rain this ""Equalizer"" leaves its star -- and the audience -- high and dry.  1 of 99 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x What not to watch View Photos A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics.

Pity the poor henchmen in Hollywood thrillers. They work countless hours in the strip joints meth labs and underground lairs of their evil bosses yet they dont have health insurance retirement plans or in most cases even names. When the action hero comes and kicks down the door the henchmen are the first to get machine-gunned. And does the villain even send flowers to the funeral? Nyet.Henchmen fall to the ground like rotten fruit in ""The Equalizer"" in which cool-hand Denzel Washington is the judge jury and executioner of bad apples in Beantown. Washington plays Robert McCall a manager at a Boston hardware store. For half an hour we wonder if this fastidious bachelor has something to hide. His career advice to an aspiring security guard (Johnny Skourtis) indicates McCall may have been trained in the military while his embrace-your-dreams advice to coffee-shop prostitute Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) suggests he was trained in a monastery.But when Teri gets roughed up and hospitalized by her Russian pimp we learn that McCall is not a man of peace. Hes a virtual killing machine who can calculate threats and responses like the Terminator. In this case his response involves driving sharp objects through the flesh of elaborately tattooed Slavs. (The cork-screw industry may never recover from the bad p.r.) It turns out that McCall is a retired assassin from ""the Agency"" and is doing penance as a freelance do-gooder. Moralists might quibble that killing a dozen flunkies to defend the honor of a street-walking acquaintance isnt necessarily ""good"" but the copious bloodshed tends to blot out any subtlety in the storytelling. ""The Equalizer"" loosely based on the TV series of the late 80s is a guilty-pleasure platform for Washingtons slow-cooked kick-butt heroism. Although it was directed by Antoine Fuqua who steered Washington to an Oscar in ""Training Day"" this isnt nearly as juicy or satisfying. Lina disappears from the movie for most of the middle section and until a ridiculous finale involving the security guard at the hardware store there are no other sympathetic characters. (Were supposed to cheer when McCall tortures a corrupt cop.)The scales of (in)justice are almost equalized by Martin Csokas as a smooth-but-ruthless Russian sent to the States to learn who is killing Mr. Bigs Boston henchmen but alas when the smoke clears this Boris isnt bad enough.

"The Equalizer review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review The Equalizer  The Equalizer entertains but Denzel deemed too good for material Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews the latest Denzel Washington vehicle ""The Equalizer"" which co-stars ""Kick-Ass"" alum Chloe Grace Moretz. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews the latest Denzel Washington vehicle ""The Equalizer"" which co-stars ""Kick-Ass"" alum Chloe Grace Moretz. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Denzel Washington could give you your moneys worth reading the phone book. ""The Equalizer"" is tha Based loosely on the 1985-1989 television series on which Edward Woodward never stuck garden shears in an enemys throat and never ever stabbed anyone through the neck with a corkscrew ""The Equalizer"" smells like a hit. But I wish it had one completely honest scene where (for example) someone asks the avenging angel-hero ""Who are you?"" And he answers ""Im Denzel Washington. And Denzel Washington can make even this thing watchable.""More and more with action pictures theres a test the filmmakers either pass or fail -- a moral intelligence exam dealing with the way the movie rewards its customers with the stuff the people have paid to consume i.e. the violence. Early on in ""The Equalizer"" directed by Antoine ""Training Day"" Fuqua from Richard Wenks script Washingtons Robert McCall murders five Russian goons in a bar bing bang boom splurch and done. Its a gory sequence but sharply staged and very swift and its a scene that passes the test. The context is not complicated; the goons are there to be killed not worried over. We enjoy the death. It works for us. Then the film gets dumber and more craven culminating in a protracted melee set in a Home Depot-like hardware emporium. Like a stoic uncle to little Macaulay Culkin in those eerily sadistic ""Home Alone"" movies McCall uses blow torches hedge clippers etc. to grind through his opponents. By the end you feel like kind of an idiot for sitting there watching because the booby-trap slaughter belongs to a movie that does not star Denzel Washington. This ones strictly for those who enjoyed ""Man on Fire"" the other prominent kid-protection fable slick and bloodthirsty in the Washington oeuvre.McCall lives a lie A trained killer with a CIA-ish past he now exists undercover a quiet if insomniac life employed by Home Mart where he is everyones favorite mentor and colleague. Chloe Grace Moretz is the young prostitute who frequents the same all-night diner favored by McCall. He sits there in the wee hours reading Hemingways ""Old Man and the Sea"" for back-story reasons and because of its handy symbolic weight. McCall is one of those characters the younger characters call ""Pops"" and hes perpetually underestimated by those who wish him harm. ""Taxi Driver"" style but without that masterworks disturbing ambiguities ""The Equalizer"" establishes the fallen angel to be saved and the avenging angel to do the saving. A Russian sleazeball with underworld connections beats the Moretz character half to death and McCall retaliates five dead in the bar. The rest of the movie concerns the Russian sleazeball higher up the sleazeball management ladder brought in to take care of McCall. Hes played by Marton Csokas who as costumed and coiffed here resembles an unnerving cross between Kevin Spacey and Adolf Hitler.At its best Fuquas film shows interest in something more than the next neck-snapping flourish. A simple dialogue scene between Washington and Csokas their first together becomes a sly showcase of one-upmanship a little longer and more interesting than youd expect. Ive said it before but Washington is both movie star and first-rate actor and he capitalizes on these down-time moments. Theyre his chance to build a character and reveal some human qualities before getting back to business. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. At one point McCall explains to Teri (Moretz) that hes just started reading ""Don Quixote"" a novel about a ""knight in shining armor in a world where knights dont exist anymore."" On the nose Sure they do For an hour or so ""The Equalizer"" glides along and works; in the second hour plus change it turns into a shameless slaughter contrivance with a flabby sense of pace. I did like one line ""When you pray for rain you gotta deal with the mud too."" Washingtons the rain; by the end the movie is the mud.mjphillipstribune.com Twitter phillipstribune""The Equalizer"" - 2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong bloody violence and language throughout including some sexual references)Running time 211Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Denzel Washington Reviews Chloe Grace Moretz The Home Depot Entertainment Denzel Washington Review Tracks  1/2 Review The Boxtrolls  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-equalizer-20140925-column.html#navtype=barker&barkername=Barker%2006%20-%20In%20Case%20You%20Missed%20It,200,theequalizer21,theequalizer,chicagotribune

Photo Scott Garfield HO / McClatchy-Tribune News Service The Equalizer review Mess with Pops and suffer 1 / 5 Back to Gallery ""The Equalizer"" is the latest in the newest wave of action film the Dont Mess With Pops genre first hinted at years ago by Harrison Ford but perfected only recently by Liam Neeson. In Dont Mess With Pops movies a peaceful man that any Baby Boomer can tell is in his prime -- but that young people have the temerity to think of as a geezer -- quietly takes abuse until he snaps and starts killing everybody in sight. The appeal of this should be apparent to anyone. Now Denzel Washington gets in on the action loping into rooms as only he can his face apparently placid but his eyes strangely dead just an average guy doing his best to solve the population crisis. ""The Equalizer"" is silly but irresistible taking situations of inherent gut-level impact and exploiting them for every bit of emotion and tension. It could never have been a great movie but between Washington and director Antoine Fuqua its as good as it could be as in good enough to keep audiences glued to the seat for more than two hours. Its based on an all-but-forgotten TV show from the 1980s about a former secret agent who offers his services to help people in need. They may face huge outsize enemies but this guy is ... the equalizer. Just having him on your side is like having your own private army. The movie updates the show for modern times and to suit Washingtons sensibility. At the start of the movie hes wearing a smock at Home Mart (think Home Depot) living a quiet life and working his way slowly through the 100 Great Books. But you can tell hes had a past. As played by Washington he is courteous and rigorous and has something in his eyes that suggests loss. Washington also gives this fellow a touch of the obsessive compulsive. He is fixated on time on schedules and on making sure that objects are properly lined up. ""The Equalizer"" fulfills the first demand of a movie of this kind. It presents us with an evil so horrible so as to give us complete license to want to see it wiped off the face of the Earth. In this case its a gang of Russian mobsters who are exploiting young girls and trapping them into prostitution. In the diner where he goes every night Robert (Washington) becomes friendly with one of them (Chloe Grace Moretz) and when she gets beat up one day well lets just say Robert takes a personal interest in her welfare. One of the best things about ""The Equalizer"" is that it starts at an extremely high pitch. For example what might be called the end of ""Act I"" is an event of such scale as would form the climax in another picture but no this movie is just getting started. Very early Fuqua and screenwriter Richard Wenk establish the terms of ""The Equalizer"" that Robert will go to extremes and so will the movie. These extremes include activities such as killing a guy with a corkscrew which takes time and effort and involves lots of blood. No surprise the movie is rated R -- as almost all action movies should be -- and Fuqua makes use of the rating. This is one gory nasty movie and its safe to say that you should probably seek other entertainment if you never want to see a villain getting killed with a nail gun or a power drill. (I did mention the Home Depot connection right?) Much hangs on Washingtons powers of stillness and observation of his ability to be read by the audience while seeming to be giving nothing away. He is the ideal complement to Fuquas slow but restless camera which swoops and glides and rarely stands still. In one impeccably composed sequence Robert walks into an office and Fuqua shows us what he sees -- as in every single thing in the room that could be used as a weapon. What we dont know is if hes looking for defensive reasons or if hes planning to improvise a slaughter. Marton Csokas is the Margaret Hamilton of ""The Equalizer."" He arrives about 30 minutes into the action not as the movies first bad guy but as its second and even worse bad guy. Hes so evil that he dresses in suits and never has to raise his voice. However at one point we get to see him with his shirt off and his torso is covered back and front with sinister tattoos. Imagine having to shave your chest every day just so as not to obscure the deaths heads youre sporting? The tattoos are an example of a filmmaker using every opportunity to reinforce character. Another example is a T-shirt that says ""Foreigner 1978 World Tour."" You would never put a villain in a T-shirt like that nor a hero. You would only put a guy (never a woman) in that T-shirt if you want audiences to pity him. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Comments click to enlarge The Equalizer Video Rated R  132 minutes  2014 Denzel Washington stars as a former CIA operative (and needless to say a human killing machine) who singlehandedly takes on the entire Russian mafia. This violent action thriller is based on the 80s TV series with Edward Woodward though director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) also borrows heavily from David Fincher aping the arty grunge of Fight Club the preternatural lighting of Zodiac and the claustrophobic interiors of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Fuqua isnt the only one desperate to elevate the routine material; screenwriter David Wenk shoehorns in a needless subplot in which the hero mentors a young loser at the local Home Depot and Washington grandstands his way through several heated soliloquys.

But we root for Denzel because hes a good guy you see and at first reluctant to dish out justice. And his victims? As Arnold Schwarzeneggers character says of the people he has killed in ""True Lies"" ""They were all bad.""MORE azcentral.coms newest movie reviewsVery bad indeed. In lesser hands this would be one of those boneheaded crime movies where the only point of the thing is to see how extreme the murder and mayhem can get.Here thats only part of the point. The bigger and better part is watching Washington particularly in his scenes with Marton Csokas who plays a psychopathic mobster named of all things Teddy. Denzel Washington as a lethal CIA agent in the film The Equalizer. (Photo Columbia Pictures )Washingtons Robert McCall is as far as anyone can tell a fastidious fellow who works at a Home Depot-like big-box store in Boston. He sleeps little if at all and he does the same thing at the same time every day -- including heading out to an all-night cafe where he orders hot water to go with his own bag of tea and works his way through the great books.His younger co-workers joke around about what he did before he started working with them. Suffice it to say they dont have a clue. No one does.MORE 52 Fall films for 2014McCall befriends Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) a young prostitute who also hangs out at the cafe. One night shes roughed up by Russian gangsters so McCall decides to put his old skills to use.And how.Denzel Washington stars as McCall in a scene from ""The Equalizer."" (Photo Sony Pictures)Because seriously who are we kidding? Its not a spoiler in a movie inspired by a fairly popular television show to say that McCall is in fact a CIA agent who is as lethal as they come. Weve seen plenty of movies like this in which hidden skills come to the fore (and frankly Im a sucker for it because I think we all secretly hope we have some kind of super talent implanted subliminally in our brains that will reveal itself eventually).But we dont usually see Washington in them. He oozes charisma even in the most brutal situations of which there are many.RELATED Denzel Washingtons 5 best moviesOne of the quirks of McCall is that he times things on his digital watch. So we know how long he expects it to take him to take out a phalanx of Russian mobsters and how close he will come to hitting his goal.Again though weve seen unstoppable killers mow their way through bad guys. The best parts of ""The Equalizer"" are the scenes in which McCall and Teddy talk to each other. Its one of those I-know-that-you-know-that-I-know situations and the two actors are outstanding. They create a nice tension and you wish there were more meetings of the minds as it were and maybe a little less mayhem.RELATED 2014 Fall TV Premiere CalendarA final showdown in the hardware store means lots of interesting uses for tools but even that isnt as entertaining as the quietly threatening exchanges between McCall and Teddy.Fuqua directed Washington to an Oscar in ""Training Day"" in 2001. Theres little chance of a repeat of that happening here. This is more of a blood-splattered lark. Truly you dont have to watch former secret agents relentlessly wipe out villains. But if you want to youd be hard-pressed to find anyone better than Washington for the task.Review The Equalizer 3.5 starsDirector Antoine Fuqua.Cast Denzel Washington Marton Csokas Chloe Grace Moretz.Rating R for strong bloody violence and language throughout including some sexual references.AZCENTRALThe Equalizer (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Particularly since 9/11 and the rise of sanctioned torture methods like waterboarding dozens of projects -- from Dexter to Zero Dark Thirty -- have provoked quarreling over the vital questions What price do the guilty pay? And what price do we? The Equalizer starring Denzel Washington as a modern-day avenging angel lives in a world where such conversations dont exist. Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) and writer Richard Wenk (The Expendables 2) have taken the outline of a 1980s CBS show and turned it into one long and loathsome bore of a movie. The plot has been gerrymandered so that we sympathize with the protagonists plight no matter how many goons he gores through the chin with a corkscrew. But make no mistake Its as challenging as slaughterhouse footage -- and about as watchable. As the ex-CIA operative Bob now demoted to cutting wood at a Home Mart Washington cant suppress his natural gravitas even though the role is meant for a dweebier actor. He takes a paternal shine to a Russian prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz) and after her pimp puts her in the hospital Bob butchers an entire crime syndicate. The material cries for a twist of irony but Fuqua stages the bloodshed with dead seriousness. When the main evildoer (Marton Csokas) chokes a call girl a music box chimes. The gloom doesnt even clear with cameo appearances by Melissa Leo donning the pantsuit she always wears for studio movies and Bill Pullman who seems to be auditioning for the Mitt Romney role in a sequel to Game Change. Were treated to one thug after another running into Bobs buzz saw -- carnage made literal in the movies hardware-store-set finale. Its the sign of an empty depressing experience when the only tension is over Bobs choice to use a power drill or a weed whacker for his next kill.

(Scott Garfield) Chloe Grace Moretz and Denzel Washington are caught in conflicts with Russian gangsters in The Equalizer. (Scott Garfield) Marton Csokas and Denzel Washington in The Equalizer (Scott Garfield) Chloe Grace Moretz in The Equalizer (Scott Garfield) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday September 24 2014 626 PM Title The Equalizer Film Info With Denzel Washington. A mysterious do-gooder takes on the mob. Director Antoine Fuqua (212). R Violence language. Area theaters. Actors who can hold our attention -- even when theyre being incredibly still -- are rare. The term ""movies"" after all is short for ""moving pictures."" But Denzel Washington sits stoic as a stone through much of ""The Equalizer"" as if hes part of an action-star sculpture garden. He dares us to look away -- and we cant. Washingtons Bob McCall is a guy who lives his life like clockwork whether sitting alone in his Boston apartment or in his favorite diner at 2 a.m. Bob is a watchful guy. Even when hes reading one of the 100 classic novels his late wife inspired him to tackle or working his shift at a Home Depot-like hardware mart Bobs attuned to everything. He gently mentors Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis) who wants to go from clerk to security guard at the hardware mart and encourages a teenage Russian prostitute Elena (Chloe Grace Moretz) also a 2 a.m. diner patron who dreams of being a singer. When Elena winds up in the hospital after her pimp beats her Bob methodically tracks down the pimp and his four henchmen offering 9000 for Elenas freedom. When that offer is sneered at Bob sets his stopwatch quietly takes the measure of the room and kills the slimeballs in 29 seconds. That brings in the pimps overseer Teddy (an enjoyably scenery-chewing Marton Csokas) in from Russia. The Russian mob controls Bobs corner of Boston keeping dirty cops on the payroll. They get a smackdown from Bob too putting Teddy and Bob on a collision course for each other. ""The Equalizer"" directed by Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") is based on the 1985-89 TV show. But the movie really could have been titled anything seeing as Bobs just a mysterious guy who helps straighten things out for people in trouble. But the name ""The Straighten-Things-Outer"" hasnt got the same snap. The movie is tense and coiled for its first hour then becomes routine in its second half when Bob has sit-downs with Teddys boss Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich) and checks in with two former chiefs (Melissa Leo Bill Pullman) of the agency he worked for. Most disappointingly Fuqua stages a final overwrought fight in Bobs hardware store. As always if you see a staple gun in the first act someone will be stapled in the third act. Still Fuqua knows how to bring out the menace in Washington whom he directed to a Best Actor Oscar in ""Training Day."" As in his underpraised performances in ""American Gangster"" and ""Flight"" Washington now 60 continues to push himself to new areas and fine-tune his charisma. He remains one of Hollywoods most effortless and engaging actors. Hes the reason to see ""The Equalizer"" even though it winds up equaling nothing more than a basic revenge thriller.

"Review Denzel Washington cant quite save The Equalizer - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Denzel Washington cant quite save The EqualizerBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 09/24/2014 120000 PM PDTUpdated 09/24/2014 123622 PM PDTThere are a couple of obvious points to be taken from ""The Equalizer"" the new film adaptation of the 1980s television show about a retired intelligence agent who helps people in trouble.First off any character played by Denzel Washington is smarter than you not afraid of you and -- in this case -- in possession of a moral compass normally reserved for holy men living on mountaintops. The audience would do practically anything for a moment of his time or a kind word. Anything.The second point is this If we really want to help foreign armies we should airdrop them entire Home Depots. Just whole stores one at a time with detailed user manuals. Because if people have a Home Depots worth of stuff and know how to use it and they still cant protect themselves they simply arent worth helping.Stylistically ""The Equalizer"" is an attractive piece of fiction with stunning and sweeping shots of gritty working-class Boston and its inhabitants including Robert McCall (Washington) a modest time-obsessed aging loner who is obviously underemployed at the big box home improvement store where he works. When a young neighborhood hooker named Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) gets brutalized by her pimp and his associates McCall comes out of retirement. From what we dont know but judging from the prompt manner in which the stopwatch-using McCall dispatches her abusers its a career in which killing five armed men in more than 30 seconds isnt considered terribly impressive.Advertisement Those pimps werent just any pimps -- they were members of Bostons chapter of a powerful Russian crime syndicate with a brutal problem-solver Teddy (played chillingly but predictably by Marton Csokas). And its soon apparent that we are being prepped for that moment when Robert and Teddy get together.As much fun as a film like this can be especially with the superior casting in effect here ""Equalizer"" offers very little that challenges viewers except perhaps to see if they can sit through some extremely unpleasant violence. Whats frustrating is how director Antoine Fuqua and writers Richard Wenk Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim get the dark atmospheric setting right and wisely let McCalls identity and back story come to a slow boil. Then inexplicably they serve up one of those stock action-movie scenes like McCall walking slowly nonchalantly away from a massive explosion (apparently not concerned that the flames and cliches are gaining on him). Still there is something fascinating about watching Washington play a dangerous yet inherently good-hearted man who cant resist helping those who cant protect themselves even when it requires turning a Home Depot into a weapons depot. But as the movie progresses McCall goes to greater and more disturbing lengths to neutralize his enemies and make examples of them. At some point the question becomes Is our hero enjoying this? And if so should he be our hero?Well ... yes if only because our hero is played by an actor talented enough to sell the goodness behind the bad things hes doing. This is a movie in which theres a clear line between good and bad and the evildoers who sacrifice their humanity get the seriously unspeakable punishment they deserve (if I have not made it abundantly clear this film is a hard R). So while McCalls methods verge on Joe Pesci-esque at times the message here is Its OK. Unfortunately ""The Equalizer"" isnt a good enough film to prompt a debate over whether it really is OK. Washingtons ever-reliable talent saves ""The Equalizer"" to a degree (Moretz is a rising star but her role here isnt big or challenging enough to do her talent justice). The movie is what it is Good guy vs. bad guy lets see who wins. Like McCall says to Teri early in the film while explaining Hemingways classic novel ""The Old Man and the Sea"" ""The old man has got to be the old man and the fish has got to be the fish."" And one of them has to win. End of story.

If youre an abused prostitute in need of a pimp beatdown hell be there. If youre a chubby coworker lacking the motivation to lose weight and land that big security-guard promotion hell put you on a fitness regimen. But theres some sad math happening when Hollywood tries to equalize one of its most distinctive leading men with generic action parts that even Liam Neeson would scowl at. The Equalizer is a stone-dumb movie unwilling to allow Washington even a hint of uniqueness (apart from the usual silverware straightening and public book reading shorthand cliches for ""smart""). The guy doesnt need to stand out because unlike the Reagan-era TV show on which this movie is based--a slick cross between Miami Vice and Death Wish--Washingtons Robert has no weakness no personal stakes no grown-up children to apologize to. All he has in director Antoine Fuquas tedious action film are interchangeable Russian scumbags to impale and impale them he does (one with a wine corkscrew). The vigilante reckoning gets more ridiculous with an impromptu excursion to a secluded mansion and some ominous porch conversations about ""the Agency."" These murky mano a manos require no further explanation apart from why they were shot in a poorly lit Home Depot-like superstore--an apt climax for a movie in desperate need of retooling.

Denzel Washingtons Bob McCall toodles about a Home Depot-like store helping customers decked out in New Balance shoes and jeans so last-century youll be looking for pleats. McCall smiles a lot coaches a co-worker in healthy eating and playacts he was once one of Gladys Knights Pips. He declaims a term papers worth of thoughts about The Old Man and the Sea to his prostitute pal (Chloe Grace Moretz) at a greasy spoon. Surprise The themes he IDs in Hemingway turn out to be the themes of the movie too. The Equalizer is so dead-set on not playing like some cheapjack TV adaptation that it actually includes a thesis statement. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Moretzs character tells him he has sad eyes that he looks like hes lost something but we know that already Fuqua shows him reading alone and then contemplating the light through sheet-plastic curtains on a loading dock the things thoughtful folks actually do but in Hollywood denote unmanly listlessness. Heres a man without a mission.As luck would have it just after he tells that prostitute that hes now reading Cervantes McCall gets some windmills to tilt at -- and shoot and gut and let bleed out while delivering hard-ass monologues. Russian pimps rough up his sex-worker friend so McCall one-man-armies them in a howlingly crazy scene thats mostly too fast to make sense of He sets his stopwatch mutters hell take them down in 18 seconds and then dispatches each lickety-split. The shot from beneath the glass coffee table that one hood gets body-flopped onto was clear and surprising enough to ring my bell; the rest you just have to take the movies word for. Film Details The Equalizer RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time131 More Info Trailer The contrast between friendly McCall and this murdering savant isnt played for laughs really but it is wildly funny. A heartbeat after one bloody triumph McCall is beaming and sunlit and surrounded by flowers in his big-box stores garden department. Its like the producers decided the reason Larry Crowne bombed was that Tom Hanks never killed every motherfucker in the room. Once the killing starts Washington still works a few oddball tics -- love the way he fumbles with the tchotchkes on a villains desk -- but all the promise of getting to know an interesting character is dashed. What were left with is increasingly up-sized action. The badass pageantry offers pleasures but its tough to shake the loss What does it mean when corporations get to be people but movie stars cant? The Equalizer is gloriously dumb hilariously violent even neurotically embarrassed. As Marton Csokass chief Russian bad guy revenges himself against McCall by strangling a second prostitute Fuqua frames one shot as the reflection in a mirror as if this tense quiet despicable scene is about something Reflections? Duality? Directorial fussiness? Later Fuqua cuts from a close-up of a knife slicing a slab of meat to one of C-notes being shrink-wrapped into plastic bags which is as succinct an indictment of modern Hollywood as I can imagine. If thats a mea culpa it doesnt make up for sticking Washington with the old dont-look-back routine as Death Star-sized explosions unleash hell behind him. A better apology for the hackneyed stuff is the surprising stuff the imaginative and bewildering stuff McCall getting a crook to talk by cuffing him in a car and pumping the interior with its own exhaust; the drillings and hangings and other mad deaths during the long climactic stealth battle inside a warehouse-size hardware store; the way a corrupt cop (David Harbour) confirms the movie is set in Boston by shouting just a minute after weve met him ""This is our town Youre a fucking guest"" The Equalizer is generous with such memorable lunacy. Its also for all its pretensions egalitarian in its borrowings full of Heat-style ""Hes watching us"" switcheroos Home Alone-style jury-rigged traps and Amazing Spider-Man-style plugs for Sony The parent companys logo appears on electronics in (at least) nine different shots. Most amusingly the movie adopts some of the old Equalizer TV shows freelance equalizing As the Russians come after him McCall keeps finding other minor problems to solve -- everyone he knows it seems has just been victimized by burglars or corrupt cops. His beatdown of the latter is the films most invigorating and its proof of Washingtons everyman appeal; the mixed-race crowd at the screening I caught burst into applause at the sight of a black man stomping white cops. Fuqua steadily parades his big moments and the movie works as unhinged spectacle. As a thriller its less certain. Once hes revealed as an impossibly skilled killer McCall never seems in danger for a moment. Contrast that to the caution Liam Neesons Matt Scudder displays in A Walk Among the Tombstones a film whose New York felt like it might disembowel him at any moment. McCalls Boston is more like a declawed cat he might one day have to put down. Outside the first battle and a cheat scene in the middle where the editing suggests McCalls in danger when he absolutely isnt the movies only tension comes from our wondering when -- and in what horrible way -- hell kill the next guy. He spends much of the last 20 minutes in the dark offing baddies with power-tools. Its great if thats what youre into but is this the best use our culture has for a talent like Denzel Washington? 1 Scott Garfield for Columbia Pictures Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

By A.A. Dowdaadowd Sep 10 2014 358 PM Share Tweet Share Tweet One key to keeping your sanity and preserving your enthusiasm during a major film festival is to stick to a balanced cinematic diet. Ive written before about how a few light or unpretentious entertainments sprinkled in among the heavy art-house fare can function like energy boosts. One cannot live on miserablism and epic long takes alone There are limits however to just how disreputable these ""slices of cake"" as Hitchcock once put it should really be. To that end what the hell is an artless brainless blast of studio engineering like The Equalizer (Grade C-) doing at a major film festival? Setting aside the presence of its serious-actor star Denzel Washington this jacked-up vigilante fantasy has no business screening at Toronto. Its pure Hollywood product--not necessarily a bad thing but definitely out of place at an event designed to celebrate movies as art. Not to be too cynical about it but were the programmers just looking for a big ticket-seller for mid-festival?Directed by Antoine Fuqua an action-junk journeyman still dining out on the 13-year-old success of Training Day The Equalizer mostly just makes you wonder what the late Tony Scott could have done with this brutish material. (His version would have been less humorless at least.) The films opening stretch is pure wheel-spinning with Washington moodily sulking about Boston exchanging pleasantries with his Home Depot coworkers and a friendly teenage prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz) he meets at a quaint diner. Washington is a gifted enough actor to sell these scenes even as the audiences knows that theyre just a protracted prelude and that his character isnt just a kindly sage fellow with a active yen for literary classics. Sure enough it isnt long before hes unleashing his inner Neeson on the stereotypical Russian scum pimping out Moretzs character. So long perfunctory quiet introspection. Welcome belated sadistic retribution.Again a little skuzzy genre pleasure is not without place at TIFF. (Midnight Madness scratches that itch quite well in fact.) But as entertainment The Equalizer rarely delivers Its like a superhero origin story invested with half-assed gravitas. Blessed with the stealth aptitude of Batman the Spidey sense of Robert Downey Jr.s Sherlock Holmes and the nonexistent mercy of The Punisher Washingtons badass Samaritan is basically unbeatable--and so watching him dispatch the various thugs that drift into his line of vision becomes boring quickly. At best the movie offers stray chuckles I laughed out loud when The Equalizer (whos never called that on-screen) calmly complies with the stick-up man robbing his place of employment only to then walk back and select a huge mallet from the tools department which hes seen cleaning and returning two scenes later. Mostly the whole film makes you feel sorry for Washington an actor too good to waste his talents on a role that requires nothing but ass-kicking and brooding.Speaking of the latter Ethan Hawke spends most of the preachy Good Kill (Grade C) in a lethargic funk. Hes playing a Las Vegas drone pilot who wants to get back in the cockpit of an actual jet both because he misses the element of real danger and because hes increasingly haunted by the collateral damage he routinely causes. Keeping the debate about UAVs alive is a noble goal but this airless screed from Andrew Niccol (Gattaca Lord Of War) is heavy on speeches and light on actual drama. Though supposedly based on a true story its tough to ascertain what that means here as this could basically be the experience of just about any drone pilot. The other soldiers among them Zoe Kravitz and Bruce Greenwood are little more than mouthpieces slipping talking points about their line of work into ""conversation."" Meanwhile back home a typically stilted January Jones does a modern variation on Betty Draper hounding her traumatized husband for being absent and drinking too much. At least Good Kills heart is in the right place--until a late scene that muddles its thesis (accidentally?) implying that bombing non-targets out of existence is totally okay if the non-targets are terrible people. Having successfully avoided one Oscar-baity biopic about a really smart guy--that would be The Theory Of Everything starring Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking--I dutifully took a look at the festivals other buzzed-about title of that nature. The Imitation Game (Grade B-) streamlines a fascinating true story into functional prestige filmmaking but its still plenty engaging thanks largely to its lead. Doing a kindler gentler spin on his aspergian Sherlock Benedict Cumberbatch plays Alan Turing the British cryptanalyst who cracked the Nazis wartime code and whose work is credited as an early advance in computer science. The film simplifies Turings theories and processes focusing instead on the comedy and drama of his antisocial interactions with the other members of his top-secret WWII encryption project. (Later scenes turn to the tragedy of his persecution as a gay man and the truly appalling way he was treated by authorities.) Cumberbatch is affecting in the part and the film moves briskly along. But while I suppose it would be naive of me to expect a highly technical science-focused portrait of this important big thinker I was still a little disappointed at the Wikipedia treatment of some of the material--especially for example a late ethical responsibility Turing and his men were supposedly saddled with and which the movie mainly touches upon in montage.In principle I admired the rigor of the new film from director Oren Moverman (The Messenger Rampart) whos made a quasi-plotless study of homelessness in New York City. But Time Out Of Mind (Grade C+) is something of a slog in no small part because it casts Richard Gere of all actors as a drunken vagrant. Clearly an anti-vanity project for the star who also produced Time Out Of Mind follows his character around the Big Apple as he looks for places to crash deals with the bureaucracy of the shelter system and tries to reconnect with his daughter (Jena Malone). Its heartening to see a hot-shot filmmaker blow his capital on such an uncommercial venture and theres real value to getting an inside look at how NYC helps (or doesnt help) those without a place to rest their heads. But the material needed a headliner who could carry the emotional freight and Gere doesnt get there. Also the way Moverman shoots the film casts his creative motives under some suspicion Filming from odd angles through doors and into kitty-corner windows he often seems to be selecting the least intuitive angle possible--a strategy that puts the focus on his showily unconventional style instead of on the actor and character.Time Out Of Mind looked especially lacking when compared to the much wonkier and more affectionate Heaven Knows What (Grade B+) a truly uncommercial look at the homeless population of NYC. The Safdie brothers Ben and Joshua are known for their strange and staunchly DIY portraits of oddball New Yorkers. For a few minutes their latest seems like an exercise in pure agitation opening with a very loud blare of synth music and introducing a character Ilya (Caleb Landry Jones) who essentially dares his girlfriend Harley (Arielle Holmes) to kill herself. She calls his bluff in a scene so chaotic--and so obnoxiously scored--that it sent several audience members trudging for the exit. I suspect on some level that this was the purpose of such initially aggressive tactics Once the more delicate viewers flee the Safdies get down to business their film fixing its focus on Harley a young heroin junkie and her day-to-day adventures through the city. The Safdies have a roughhewn visual style all their own; they often shoot in extreme close-up with what looks like telephoto lens capturing the actors in bobbing invasive glances. Heaven Knows What quickly obtains an oddly charming rhythm a sense of eavesdropping on sometimes unlikable but fully realized social outsiders. Over a brisk 93 minutes the filmmakers create the impression of a whole world on the margins of New York. And they find in Holmes an actual addict essentially playing herself a true discovery. Shes the films biggest selling point--a raw nonprofessional talent charismatic enough to earn our instant sympathies even as the Safdies assault us with grungy imagery and deafening music. It wont be to all tastes but it was one of the more distinctive films I saw this week. Otherwise I spent most of Monday and Tuesday sitting through a string of disappointments some more disappointing than others. Actually ""disappointment"" is a silly reaction to have to any new film by Takashi Miike as the insanely prolific (and possibly just insane) Japanese director barfs out as many bad movies as good ones. Its the great ones however like Audition and 13 Assassins that keep me coming back for more--and Ive sat through my fair share of follies like Over Your Dead Body (Grade C) Miikes addition to the popular life-imitating-theater genre. The director parallels a baroque play-within-the-film about an ancient feudal lord paying a ghostly price for betraying his wife with the tedious backstage drama of its actors. The movie is dull right up until the point that it becomes completely characteristically bonkers with Miike trotting out some of his trademark obscene violence. Id call it a fan-only affair but even fans will probably be bored at least until the bloodbath starts in earnest.Throughout Over Your Dead Body I remained uncertain if the play being performed was a real work or an invented one. (It appears to be the latter though dont quote me on that.) Conversely I felt falsely certain that Return To Ithaca (Grade C+) the new film from The Class director Laurent Cantet was based on a play. But no its just overwritten and un-cinematic--a reunion gabfest in which a group of aging Cuban activists reconnect in Havana for a long night of trotting out old grievances and making overdue confession. More disheartening was Haemoo (Grade C+) which I had heard positive things about but which turned out to be an underwhelming (if visceral) drama about the crew of a fishing boat and its disastrous attempt to smuggle illegal immigrants from China to South Korea. Shim Sung-Bo who cowrote Bong Joon-Hos great Memories Of Murder shows only a fraction of the formal chops his collaborator possesses. Bong himself worked on this script and his familiar mix of tones--slapstick comedy bleeding into tragedy and horror and action--proves an uneasy fit for the narrative. What Shim needed was a steady escalation of tension as well as characters a little easier to connect to. (The hero and heroine are blandly earnest most of the other seafarers almost cartoons of depravity.)The diamonds in the rough of this two-day stretch were films that Ignatiy has already seen and praised so Ill echo his sentiments quickly. Eden (Grade B+) is an intimate epic to sink into; it uses the unchanging age of its actors whose characters stubbornly resist changing for two decades as a melancholy commentary on the maturation process. Christian Petzolds superb Phoenix (Grade A-) on the other hand recasts Vertigo as a post-war psychological drama. If Im half-a-grade less enthusiastic than my colleague on that one chalk it up to my general anxiety about declaring instant greatness. Or maybe Im just being notoriously stingy with the straight ""A."" Either way its an ingeniously plotted and rather heartbreaking movie--the kind you go to film festivals to discover and which can bring you back to life after such supposedly ""fun"" detours as The Equalizer.

Denzel Washington balances the scales of justice -- and challenges Liam Neeson for a slice of the middle-aged action-hero pie -- in ""The Equalizer"" an ultraviolent update of the 1985-89 CBS drama series that featured Edward Woodward as a former government agent turned pro-bono avenging angel. But in making the leap from small screen to large and from pre-Giuliani New York to post-recession Boston director Antoine Fuqua and writer Richard Wenk (""16 Blocks"") have also traded the series elemental underdog appeal for a ""Taken""-style bloodbath that pits Washington against a surfeit of central-casting Russian gangsters and corrupt Beantown cops. Ponderously overlong and not even half as much fun as it should have been ""The Equalizer"" still gets a lot of mileage out of Washingtons unassailable star presence which should translate to solid if not spectacular returns upon the pics Sept. 26 release. Although he shares a character name and skill set with his TV predecessor Washingtons Robert McCall is otherwise literally and figuratively an Equalizer of a different color a childless widower (instead of a divorcee with an estranged son) who takes public transit (rather than tooling around in a sleek black Jaguar) and maintains his anonymity by working as a sales associate at a Home Depot-type superstore (in lieu of advertising his special services in the classified ads). In an odd flourish that at times makes Fuquas film feel like a cross between ""Death Wish"" and ""Reading Rainbow"" this McCall is also a passionate bookworm who spends his long lonely nights leafing through Hemingway and Cervantes in one of those retro backlot diners where everybody knows your name -- especially Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) the gold-hearted Russian hooker with recording-artist dreams who makes small talk with McCall whenever she isnt being roughed-up by her thuggish pimp. When a battered Teri ends up in the hospital clinging to life something long dormant in McCall begins to stir though by this point were already more than 30 minutes into ""The Equalizer"" -- an overly generous assumption of how long the audience for this kind of movie is willing to wait for the ass-whooping to begin. Thats doubly true when what we get instead is a protracted setup emphasizing McCalls camaraderie with his fellow stock boys and cashiers including a jovial overweight aspiring security guard (Johnny Skourtis) whom McCall puts through the paces of a vigorous diet and exercise regimen. The helpful tips about good clean living abound but when the retributive violence finally kicks in it does so with a brutal sickening thud. The scene in which McCall dispenses with a half-dozen Russian heavies in under 20 seconds establishes the characters handiness with ordinary household  objects (particularly a pair of corkscrews) but it also sets a skull-crushing eye-gouging ante that the movie can never hope to top -- though it certainly tries. McCall has done a lot of things in his life he isnt proud of he explains in one of the films quieter moments but to judge by the evidence onscreen he still takes a certain pleasure in watching his victims gasp their last blood-choked breaths which Fuqua likewise lingers on for maximum unpleasantness. (The violence in ""The Equalizer"" is meant to be more serious and less exuberantly splattery than in a Tarantino movie but in fact its just as over-the-top and a good deal less thought-provoking.) As the body count rises fleeting details of McCalls past begin to emerge (cue cameos by Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo as former colleagues at ""The Agency""). Then reinforcement arrives in the form of Teddy (Marton Csokas) right-hand hitman to elaborately tattooed Moscow oligarch Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich) who doesnt take kindly to the ruptures McCall has caused in his international criminal pipeline. Csokas is a fine actor with a purring privately amused voice that sounds a touch like James Masons but hes visibly bored playing an accented assassin with ice in his veins and vodka on his breath. And because Teddy seems to have a bottomless supply of devoted (but ineffectual) minions at his disposal the longer ""The Equalizer"" stays onscreen the more it comes to resemble some endless game of post-Perestroika whack-a-mole. Fuqua and Wenk envision Boston as such an irredeemable pit of corruption that they dont even bother to give McCall one of those honest-cop antagonists who sympathizes with our vigilante hero but still wants him to play by the rules. The closest they come is the all-mobbed-up officer Masters (David Harbour) who agrees to help McCall but only after the latter gently persuades him with a combination of garden hose and carbon monoxide. What keeps the film watchable through it all is Washington arguably the last of the classical movie stars who manages to bring almost every role he plays excitingly to life (even one as dreary as this). McCall may not be a patch on the actors corrupt L.A. narcotics detective in Fuquas ""Training Day"" --  a character Washington pushed toward the mythic -- or for that matter the alcoholic CIA alum turned mercenary he played in Tony Scotts vastly superior ""Man on Fire"" (2004). Still in scene after scene here the actor locates something vital in the character a fraught moral compass spinning behind McCalls seemingly impassive eyes. But Washington deserves better and so does the audience. In terms of production values ""The Equalizer"" marks a rebound for Fuqua after the shlock shenanigans of last years ""Olympus Has Fallen"" though cinematographer Mauro Fiores arty pseudo-Eastwoodian lighting is so dark at times that combined with editor John Refouas frantic cutting its nigh impossible to tell what exactly is going on. In one of the films cornier touches only after McCall has (momentarily) rid the city of its evildoers does warm daylight finally break through the unrelenting gray skies.

Sterling Harris says June 21 2016 at 1152 am CRITICS ARE OVERRATED AND NARCISSISTIC. I ENJOYED THE MOVIE AND I AM HAVE PURCHASED THE DVD. WILL SEE THE NEXT ONE LOVE SEEING BULLIES TAKEN OUT A BIT GROSS BUT IT IS ABOUT KILLING AND ABUSE BY POLICE THE RUSSIAN MOB EXTREMELY PSYCHOPATHIC Reply FractionCalc says February 15 2016 at 922 pm I like this movie. Although Robert is already a retired agent but he cannot stand on the wickedness brought around on his place by the russian mafia. And when he realized that Alina and other whore was forced against their will and badly beaten he decided to end this wickedness. It is really a good story for a heroic act. I highly recommend this movie. I give 5 star on this. Thanks. Reply Poze amuzante says February 1 2015 at 1230 pm The Equalizer is NOT Man on Fire. The Equalizer is NOT your typical action flick. Washingtons Robert McCall is not self-destructive or addicted. Though there are great choreographed fights special effects and fantastic explosions The Equalizer is more Bourne than Bond. Denzel Washington portrays this ex-CIA operative who is content to live a meticulously simple life. Quietly contained but with ever-building intensity Washington turns in another stellar performance. Chloe Grace Moretz as the teenage prostitute is a force... Antoine Fuqua the directer who brought us Training Day which earned Denzel his Best Actor Oscar helms this movie with a steady hand. His direction of the drama and the action blend seamlessly drawing us into the complexity of this character-driven piece. Robert McCall keeps to himself content to live his ordinary life; he is every mans man. But his steady moral compass and strong sense of justice lead him back into the fray. This character is not infallible and he is not looking for trouble. He just wants whats right. This film is a superbly acted exciting and violent ride In the pursuit of justice there will be blood. But this time youll be rooting for the good guy and I a fifty years young woman loved every minute of it Reply Lee says December 31 2014 at 937 pm I agree David great entertaining movie. But Im a sucker for the strong silent type trying to live a quiet life til some dipshit pisses him off. think; Shane Man on Fire Open Range (Costner is terrific). Love em all. But you need to just check your skepticism at the door and let yourself be entertained. Reply David says September 28 2014 at 657 pm Completely disagree with your rating. A little long but absolutely entertaining. You know its good when every person walking out of the packed theater raves about it on the walk out. Lets be honest - nobody really cares about a critics rating anyway. Reply Carl Lucas says September 8 2014 at 157 pm ""post-Perestroika whack-a-mole"" And they say poetry is dead. Classic. Reply Ben Rakofsky says September 25 2014 at 855 am I disagree. I liked it. This film wont win any awards and it wont be liked by a lot of critics but the violence in this film makes the film and it makes it watchable. It was nice to see that was cost for violence to the hero physically emotionally and psychology. Plus it wasnt violence for the sake of violence so when the violence occurred it meant something. I will agree the villain wasnt very good. Reply cam says September 7 2014 at 517 pm ""That its not like the TV show"" is the dumbest criticism anyone can give which just betrays their age and the fallacy of nostalgia. A ""problem"" that can be solved as easily as ""pretend the title is something else"" isnt really a ""problem"" at all. Reply Johaannu says September 15 2014 at 756 pm Its not the dumbest criticism at all when the show is 10x better than this by-the-numbers crap. It has nothing to do with ""nostalgia."" If the filmmakers didnt think the show had any value they wouldnt be leveraging the shows title to get people into theaters. Instead of ""pretending"" the title is something else simply CALL the film something else - thats called having faith in your product instead of having to rely on residual ""nostalgia"" to sell your crap. If the filmmakers really thought this film had any worth whatsoever theyd have called it something else and released it in a month when people actually go to movies. In other words - youre wrong. Moving on. Reply Old School Quality says September 7 2014 at 346 pm Hey Scott have you ever liked a violent film that wasnt directed by one of your art house buddies (Coens PTA etc.)? You dont have the gene to enjoy commercial bad-ass filmmaking. Its tiresome to read your reviews for this genre of movies. Seriously - stick with reviewing the works of your beloved indie darlings. This stuff is over your head... or too far below your belt. Reply ejody says September 7 2014 at 323 pm ""... at times makes Fuquas film feel like a cross between ""Death Wish"" and ""Reading Rainbow..."" Cant. Wait. Reply Rogue428 says September 7 2014 at 126 pm Call it ""Man on Fire 2"" and Im there. Loved the first one. ;) Love the original TV show too but lets face it these reboots are never the same. Reply LOL says September 7 2014 at 125 pm Does it have the Equalizers TV theme tune? Reply JD says September 7 2014 at 1246 pm Sounds and looks far too much like Man on Fire which I hated so I will not be seeing this. Reply curious says September 7 2014 at 1155 am the best part of the equalizer was the sophisticated presence and lifestyle of the equalizer how he played against type. without that why call it this? Reply Johaannu says September 15 2014 at 758 pm Why? Because some execs were sitting around a board room one day and after watching Liam Neesons newly found ""action film"" status they felt they could so the same with an actor like Denzel. As an insurance they named it after an existing property that people might remember in order to get them into the theaters so that theyd remember THAT instead of thinking it was simply another ""Taken"" film with a different actor. Guess it didnt work. Reply See All 16 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Divorce Marks Sarah Jessica Parkers Return To HBO But...

Daily Edition Login to download The Equalizer Toronto Review 1100 AM PDT 9/7/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS The Russians are coming and Denzel is waiting for them in a bang-up action thriller that should launch a franchise TWITTER Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua reteam for an action film based on the 80s TV series of the same name Its almost as if the good bad old days of the Cold War are here again in The Equalizer in which Denzel Washingtons former intelligence op kicks more nasty Russian ass than anyone has onscreen since James Bond.  The comparison is not an idle one since this updating of the fondly remembered late-80s TV show is the most exciting violent and stylish film of its type in a very long while. Viscerally satisfying on a primal level the stars reunion with his Training Day director Antoine Fuqua looks to be such a commercial success that a sequel said to be already in the works should be put on the Sony fast track. Theres nothing fundamentally new about what Fuqua and screenwriter Richard Wenk (whose work to date has been on lower-end action fare like The Mechanic and The Expendables 2) have put together here The hotshot government agency man whos retired for tragic personal reasons his zen-like attitude borrowed from Asian action films the thuggish Russian gangsters who run vulgar nightclubs and hookers and even the kind of hyper-vision and instant sizing up of situations that has recently been used to notable effect by Benedict Cumberbatchs Sherlock Holmes. Success rests in what you do with such elements and it begins here with how simply and effectively Fuqua and Washington create a mystique around the latters Robert McCall character. Middle-aged and shaven-headed the man calmly and capably holds down his job at a Home Mart mega-store in Boston and lives very simply in a spare stripped-down apartment. Fastidious and health-conscious he has trouble sleeping and habitually heads late at night to a corner diner straight out of the 1930s where he has his own table and quietly reads the great books over tea; the filmmakers no doubt consulted Edward Hopper on the joints design. His aura is such that he seems to have an invisible shield around him so no one bothers him but he takes an interest in a bedraggled teenaged prostitute Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) who is eventually hauled off by a pissed-off Russian pimp. Highly controlled and self-possessed McCall has a serene aura about him that suggests hidden depth and when Teri winds up in a hospital after a terrible beating the man methodically tracks down the headquarters of the ""Russian Nights"" escort service above a nightclub and politely tries to negotiate for Teris freedom with five of the most vile lowlifes the screen has seen in some time. What follows is a daringly protracted set-piece of Tarantino-esque length in which a great deal of talk is followed by violence that is richly satisfying entirely because it is so well deserved. Although we dont yet know McCalls background his exceptional ability to size up a situation and deal with it physically proves thrilling in this initial manifestation; from here on the audience knows its in good hands and can collectively settle in for a very full meal. The disruption of their business so disturbs the Russians that they send in a top fixer to set things right. Its quickly apparent that this man with the deceptively benign name of Teddy will be a formidable opponent; hes every inch a worthy Bond villain--smart articulate ruthless and when all is revealed an absolute psychopath. Marton Csokas is dynamite in the part and his scariness is only increased by the fact that from certain angles and with the right lighting he bears an eerie resemblance to a better-looking Adolf Hitler. It isnt often that a fine actor comes along who could be physically convincing in this role so someone might want to think about writing a script that could take advantage of this rare casting opportunity. Teddy is so sharp and confident about dispatching McCall without difficulty that his repeated frustrated attempts become all the more pleasurable to behold. Just like the Irish have done for years the Russians now have Boston cops on their payroll and McCall gives them a rough time when they try to push around hard-working friends of his. Because of his longtime low profile however McCall is like an invisible man in the city so it takes a while for Teddy and his goons to track him down and when they do hes always one step ahead of them. It isnt until the films halfway point that McCalls background is revealed in a scene at a lavish country estate occupied by retired Bush-era intelligence chiefs (Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo) where the guest is directed to the very top of the Russian mafia food chain. Secrets about McCalls past are also revealed that make basic aspects of his talents and lifestyle comprehensible things that wont be too surprising to fans of the television Equalizer which starred Edward Woodward and ran to 88 episodes across four seasons between 1985-89. The astounding extent to which the Russians have their claws into American businesses is revealed in another major set-piece in which McCall brazenly invades one of their holding facilities singlehandedly taking it over dismissing the workers and nailing the corrupt cops. The way the hero always manages to turn long odds and adverse circumstances to his advantage is sheerest make-believe of course. But the hokey yet beguiling device of McCalls ability to pre-visualize how violence will go down largely disarms any objections and Washingtons cool but massively charismatic performance becomes a powerful magnet for the projection of viewer fantasies much the way things work for James Bond. A final suspense set-piece involving hostages taken at the Home Mart complex tops things off with some pretty gruesome violence involving tools conveniently at hand in the store. The basic conclusion one can take home is that it might take the entire Russian army to defeat the crafty Robert McCall a character so alluring that a franchise appears mandatory. Ramping up his style to a more dynamic and elegant level than hes achieved previously Fuqua socks over the suspense and action but also takes the time for some quiet even spare moments to emphasize the heros calm and apartness. Mauro Fiores cinematography has a rugged beauty and all other behind-the-scenes artisans contribute strongly to a cohesive whole.

So it is with ""The Equalizer"" a big-screen revamp of the 1985-89 TV series with Denzel Washington taking the title role from Edward Woodward. The films script might be a little on the nose with its metaphors and there are a few moments of action that verge on self-parody right down to the familiar trope that cool guys dont look at explosions as they walk away from them. But at the same time seeing Washington reunited with his ""Training Day"" director Antoine Fuqua is reason enough to celebrate as well as the films resolutely R-rated violence and its moody Boston-based urban noir look and feel. See video Denzel Washingtons Latest Equalizer Trailer Spotlights Eminems New Track (Video) Anyone expecting kick-started action from the jump will be mildly disappointed; Fuqua and screenwriter Richard Wenk (""The Expendables 2"") instead spend time establishing Washingtons life and times as Robert McCall a solitary man who works at a home-improvement warehouse and lives a life of ritual and quiet as a bulwark against chaos sadness and the past. When insomnia strikes he goes to a local diner -- almost a duplicate of Hoppers ""Nighthawks"" in a nice touch -- and chats with regulars like escort Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz) whom McCall does not judge. When Teri is beaten savagely however McCall leaves his quiet life behind; he used to be a killer and he still is one no matter how hard he tries to hide behind his copy of ""Don Quixote."" As he explains the book to Teri -- ""Its about a man who wants to be a knight even though he lives in a time when there are no knights ... "" -- even the least literate viewer should get the subtext. Washington is terrific here a blue-collar Bourne far from the champagne sophistication of Bond his astonishing physicality springing out in his action scenes and in his decisive moments while still suggesting the calm collected thought before each brief burst of violence. Washington is that rarity an action-film star capable of gravitas and feeling an actor capable of selling fight sequences and carefully contemplated plans that form in the instant between seconds. Cinematographer Mauro Fiore (""Avatar"" ""Training Day"") shoots the film with an emphasis on clarity and comprehension but he also captures the bruise-blue dark nights on the Boston streets as well as the lens-flare dawn that comes after the darkness. Editor John Refoua (""Olympus Has Fallen"") keeps a firm hand on the films careful measured pace as circumstances build until they demand a response from McCall resulting in action that accelerates until the final denouement in McCalls workplace where he proves himself both handy and homicidal. Also read Sequel to Denzel Washington Thriller Equalizer Moves Forward as Sony Brings Back Writer Richard Wenk (Exclusive) Wenk adds some nice touches -- McCalls depicted as lightly obsessive-compulsive and the film offers a few grim laughs between murders -- while skipping over some of the scenes youd expect in an enterprise like this. But the films bad guy a Russian mob fixer played by Marton Csokas is so generic as to be almost invisible. There are a few moments in the film that exist in a slightly different context in light of recent events (Washington violently and calmly taking down wave after wave of arrogant racist corrupt Boston cops for one example) but it largely shuns political commentary in favor of a simple conflict between human decency and very specific skills on one side and animal-like criminals and thugs on the other. Also read Reese Witherspoon Jake Gyllenhaal Jessica Chastain Films Headed to Toronto Film Festival Moretz is fine earning our sympathy even as she teeters toward disaster in stiletto heels; Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo have brief but engaging moments as well. Willfully empty but wildly entertaining ""The Equalizer"" stands out from its peers like a wolf among lapdogs as Fuqua and Washington bring out the best in each other for the benefit of the audience. The films coda suggests the possibility of further adventures for the resolute and righteous Robert McCall; for once that seemingly obligatory finale for a would-be franchise feels more like a promise than a threat.

Photo Scott Garfield/Columbia Pictures MOVIE REVIEW The Equalizer Old guy makes a killing. Running time 132 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity sexuality). At the Union Square the Harlem USA others. Why should Liam Neeson have all the fun? Denzel Washington promisingly launches his own senior action franchise in ""The Equalizer"" starring as a lethally skilled CIA agent who comes out of retirement to rid Boston of the Russian Mafia. Washington who turns 60 in December vividly demonstrates that he wont be ready for ""The Expendables"" team of has-beens anytime soon in this enormously entertaining lavishly mounted extravaganza that incidentally puts Neesons ""Taken"" series to shame. Antoine Fuqua who directed Washington to a Best Actor Oscar for ""Training Day"" 13 years ago serves up Tarantino-caliber action sequences in this slam-bang thriller loosely inspired by the 1980s TV series of the same name with Edward Woodward. Bald and graying at the temples Washington plays Robert McCall a softspoken and kindly manager at an enormous Home Depot -- er Home Mart -- that will eventually handily serve as the location for the films breathtakingly spectacular denouement. When a Russian pimp severely beats up a prostitute (Chloe Grace Moretz) whom Robert regularly encounters at his favorite coffee shop after work Washington decides to dust off his old skills to settle the score with her tormentors. Theres nothing hugely original about the script by Richard Wenk (who cowrote ""Expendables 2"" with Sylvester Stallone) but Washington is a master at putting his own inimitable and stylish spin on even the most familiar situations. Marton Csokas makes a splendid heavy as the scary fixer the Russians send to stop Washingtons one-man mob-wrecking crew -- after Robert invades a restaurant and makes quick work of Moretzs beaters. Our quick-witted hero always stays one step ahead of Csokas escaping repeated traps while methodically taking down dirty cops on the Russkies payroll. In one bravura sequence he singlehandedly shuts down their money laundering operation. And rest assured Robert wont stop until he gets the Moscow oligarch who is pulling the strings -- though Washingtons former CIA boss (Melissa Leo) who thought he was dead assures our hero the head Russian is considered ""untouchable"" by the Company. The pulse-pounding pace never flags over two hours even when Washington is given quieter moments to demonstrate how hes become a thinking mans senior action hero. Its the latest chapter in a remarkable career that began with a bit part as a teenage mugger blown away by Charles Bronson in ""Death Wish"" 40 years ago. Sometimes quite graphic ""The Equalizer"" doesnt sanitize its violence as so many films do these days but the mayhem isnt gratuitous or unmotivated. The opening chapter in this new revenge franchise is good enough to restore your faith in the much-abased genre -- and a lot of fun in the bargain.
