(Newmarket) BY Elizabeth Weitzman Joe Neumaier DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Friday January 21 2011 400 AM The Way Back Soviet prisoners escape into the Himalayas during World War II. At area theaters. (213). PG-13 Violence.Whether or not this gripping movie is based on fact -- the veracity of its 2006 source book has been questioned -- it is a good old-fashioned prison-escape story that draws you in even with its faults. In 1940 facing decades in a Soviet gulag on trumped-up charges a group of prisoners escapes to endure everything from freezing cold starvation and capture to scorching heat dehydration and snakes.Ed Harris is the sole stoic American Jim Sturgess plays a Polish soldier and Colin Farrell is a murderous Russian criminal whose guts (and knife) will be needed as the prisoners walk out of Siberia over the Himalayas through China and into India. The man-versus-the-natural world story is in Weirs wheelhouse and Harris and Farrell get into a scene-stealing duel. Worth the trek. Joe NeumaierThe Woodmans Documentary about the late New York artist Francesca Woodman and her family. At Film Forum (122). Not rated Nudity.This intimate film is a fascinating glimpse into the emotions and art of a New York family whose bright star committed suicide 30 years ago at age 22.Director C. Scott Willis mixes Woodmans journal entries and still haunting beautifully moody photos and films with her parents reflecting on their late daughters artistic direction her world view and her continuing place in their lives. What emerges is a portrait of the ""psychic risk"" as her father says of living a creative life -- and the intense feeling that entails. J.N.Applause An alcoholic actress struggles to patch up her life. At the Angelika and the Village East (125). Not rated. In Danish with English subtitles.Though much of ""Applause"" a Dutch film just asking to be remade with Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock feels confining and self-aggrandizing theres no denying that you cant take your eyes off star Paprika Steen. As Thea an actress of note just out of rehab Steen looks shaken and disheveled hungry for attention from the mirror her ex-husband and everyone else.As Thea goes through the motions of trying to regain custody of her young sons its clear shes really trying to regain her sense of self-worth. Steen her face full of remorse does a great job of portraying someone unclear of where to go or what to say without a script. J.N.Gabi on the Roof in July Comedy about young New York artists. At the ReRun (133). Not rated Nudity sex language drugs.Lawrence Levine should earn some attention with this agreeable indie comedy in which he also stars as Sam a perpetually harried Brooklyn artist. Though no one in his life is low-maintenance hes really got his hands full once his rebellious sister Gabi (Sophia Takal) arrives from Oberlin for summer vacation.Levine offers a mostly sharp takedown of middle-class hipsterdom and hes terrific as a guy whose easygoing demeanor hides continuing growing pains. But its unlikely youll share Levines affection for the spoiled Gabi whose entitlement and immaturity arent nearly as endearing as were meant to believe. Elizabeth WeitzmanThe Housemaid Thriller about a troubled nanny. At the Lincoln Plaza IFC (147). Not rated Nudity sex violence. In Korean with subtitles.If youre going to remake even a semi-classic youd better have something valuable to add. Korean director Im Sang-soo cant improve on Kim Ki-youngs 1960 original a jarring and operatic cult favorite. Still he does tweak the themes in intriguing fashion.As in the first film a beautiful young housekeeper insinuates herself into a wealthy family eventually becoming pregnant by her employers husband. Then the crazy really begins. Theres little here we havent seen before but Im deserves credit for challenging our assumptions about victims and villains. E.W.DHOBI GHAT Several lives intertwine in Mumbai. At area theaters (140). Not rated Mature themes. In English and Hindi with subtitles.Mumbai masses may sprawl across Kiran Raos screen but once she zooms in we see a city divided by invisible walls.Impoverished Munna (Prateik Babbar) is a ""dhobi"" or laundryman in love with Shai (Monica Dogra) a wealthy banker on leave from America. But shes interested in successful artist Arun (Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan) who in turn is obsessed with Yasmin (Kriti Malhotra) a young wife trapped in a miserable arranged marriage.From performances to pacing nearly every element of Raos debut is uneven. But her passionate vision of so much useless prejudice leaves a lingering impact. E.W.

CAST Ed Harris Colin Farrell Jim Sturgess Saoirse Ronan WHEN/WHERE ""The Way Back"" showtimes and tickets LENGTH 159 The tale of a 4000-mile journey from Siberia to India ""The Way Back"" is based on Slavomir Rawiczs 1956 memoir ""The Long Walk The True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" and begins with a dedication to three men who survived the ordeal. Three however is not the number depicted in the movie. And theres another question about the one who wrote the book. After Rawiczs death in 2004 his story was effectively debunked as fiction based on the experiences of others specifically a Polish gulag survivor named Witold Glinski who stepped forward in 2009. Pesky facts The films director and co-writer Peter Weir now graciously calls the memoir a ""novel."" advertisement | advertise on newsday Though dates and numbers may not jibe ""The Way Back"" does add up to a thoroughly compelling survival story. Jim Sturgess plays Janusz a young Polish officer exiled for being ""critical"" of the Soviet regime. At Camp 105 he meets political prisoners and actual criminals but makes no distinctions when picking his group of escapees. During a blinding snowstorm Janusz and his team flee into the woods - only 3999 miles to go. Weir has always loved atmospheric locales (""The Year of Living Dangerously"") and group dynamics (""Picnic at Hanging Rock"") and here he makes the most of both. The wanderers include among others a friendly murderer (Colin Farrell) an embittered American emigre (Ed Harris) and a stray girl (Saoirse Ronan) who form an ad hoc family as they travel from frozen woods to blistering-hot desert and beyond. In its visceral details and poignant emotions at least ""The Way Back"" has the ring of truth.

"The Way Back (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Way Back (PG-13) Amazing tale of survival dwells too much on facts too little on people Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald1/20/2011 Editor rating 2 The Way Back writer-director Peter Weirs first film in seven years (his last was Master and Commander The Far Side of the World) is a grand sweeping epic populated by cyphers -- an ambitious production in which the scale dwarfs the characters. Taking liberties from Slavomir Rawiczs The Long Walk The True Story of a Trek to Freedom a nonfiction book whose veracity was later questioned (the films credits refer to it as a novel) Weir tells the extraordinary tale of a group of POWs sentenced by Stalin to a frozen Siberian gulag in 1939. ""Nature is your jailer and she is without mercy"" a prison guard barks at the inmates warning them that escape into the surrounding wilderness would be certain suicide (and if not the bounty immediately placed on their heads would make them constant targets). But seven of the prisoners (including Jim Sturgess as a condemned Polish spy Colin Farrell as a violent Russian thug and Ed Harris as an American engineer) decide to make a break anyway opting to risk the 4000-mile journey to safety on foot using their meager supplies and their wits. The set-up is involving and the fact that the story is based on true events makes The Way Back even more engaging -- but only to a point. Weir intentionally adopts a brusque unsentimental tone for the story He wants to put you into the mind frame of these men who are facing near-impossible odds barely know or trust each other and must deal with a new challenge with almost every step. Alternating between the prisoners quiet scenes of dialogue and large-scale set pieces worthy of David Lean The Way Back tries hard to convey the characters hardships from a first-hand perspective. But its stop-and-start feel keeps you from ever getting fully absorbed in the story and events such as the mens encounter with an orphaned girl (The Lovely Bones Saoirse Ronan) feel like clunky plot devices regardless of whether she actually existed Weir shot the film and snagged A-list actors without the support of a studio This is despite its big-budget scale and polish an independent movie. But its overlong running time along with boneheaded decisions such as the opening title card that tells you the exact number of men who survived make you wonder if The Way Back might have benefited from constructive criticism from an outside observer. This is an impressive production and technical feat but through most of it I kept thinking about how difficult the filming conditions must have been and not about the lives of the men in front of me.

HO Colin Farrell (left) and Ed Harris in ""The Way Back"" (Newmarket Films) In 1934 80000 Chinese soldiers marched thousands of miles to tighten the grip of communism across Asia. Less well-known is that in 1940 eight Siberian fugitives marched thousands of miles to escape it.""The Way Back"" is based on a true story and in the hands of Peter Weir who has directed such classy action films as ""Master and Commander"" and ""Gallipoli"" you would expect an epic with brains and hearts. Instead we settle for sturdy craft with a stellar cast struggling to breathe life into the cold material.Two significant factors make this saga different from a conventional prison-escape story the political nature of the prison and the wintry wasteland that surrounds it. The film does a painfully good job of evoking the harsh conditions in the Siberian gulag but it tells us surprisingly little about the inmates alleged crimes or the homes for which they long. Our hero is Janusz (Jim Sturgess) a Pole accused of disloyalty to the Communist Party and forcibly denounced by his trembling wife. Exiled to a prison camp in snowbound Siberia he is immediately befriended by Khabarov (Mark Strong) an actor who teaches Janusz the necessary survival skills and confides a plan to escape. When an opportunity presents itself the escapees include an American engineer who was arrested in Moscow (Ed Harris) a cutthroat gangster (Colin Farrell) and the artist who sketched nudie pictures for the lonely inmates (Gustaf Skarsgard).As they trek south toward Mongolia the starving men are followed and eventually joined by a mysterious girl named Irena (Saoirse Ronan). Yet there is never a hint of sexual tension let alone cannibalism or even much bickering among the desperate escapees. Their greatest foe is geography which means we see lots of physical suffering and some impressive panoramas from pine forests to parched sand dunes but we dont get a glimpse into the inner lives of the characters. Within this downbeat dirge every quiver of liveliness is amplified from a juicy deer thats trapped in a bog to a Buddhist temple filled with fallen treasures.But the long stretches between stations make ""The Way Back"" an arduous road.

By Peter Rainer Film critic January 21 2011 Save for later Saved Colin Farrell plays a Russian mobster sharing prison time with a Polish soldier who escapes from a Siberian work camp in The Way Back. Newmarket Films/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Peter Weir is a director who does not to put it mildly knock out one movie after another. His last ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" came out seven years ago. After a series of collapsed projects hes finally come through with ""The Way Back"" about a long trek by gulag prisoners to freedom. No doubt the subject hit home with him.The film is based on a 1956 memoir by Polish soldier Slavomir Rawicz ""The Long Walk The True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" that was subsequently at least in part discredited. (He was indeed forced-marched by the Russians to a Siberian gulag but he didnt escape he was amnestied.)Related Ten best movies of 2010 Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Nevertheless the films core idea that some people will do anything to survive even the harshest conditions has a primal pull. This is an ""inspired by"" movie and is best approached in that spirit - i.e. dont hold the filmmakers accountable folks. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? It opens in 1940 in Russia-occupied Poland with the sentencing of Janusz (Jim Sturgess) a Polish soldier who has been denounced on trumped-up espionage charges by his wife and sentenced to a Siberian labor camp. Janusz recognizes that his wife was likely tortured and his prime reason for escaping the gulag is to work his way back to her to forgive her.The early sequences in the gulag are so hard-bitten and harrowing that the escape by Janusz and six other prisoners represents a liberation for us as well. Weir and co-writer Keith Clarke dont fill out these opening scenes with a lot of hokey Hollywood theatrics. Despite the presence of some well-known actors - including Ed Harris playing an American laborer who fled Depression-era America for work in Russia and Colin Farrell as a Russian mobster - a semidocumentary harshness hangs over these early scenes.Because the climate is so killing the gulag is not overwhelmingly well guarded. It doesnt need to be. The prisoners escape knowing full well that the elements will probably do them in faster than any guns or dogs. And so begins a 4000-mile slog spanning four seasons through the frozen forests of Siberia the plains of Mongolia across the Great Wall of China and the Gobi Desert to Tibet and finally the snowcapped Himalayas. Its a survivalist travelogue and Weir a detail freak makes certain we experience every inch of the journey by offering up choice close-ups of blistering and bloody feet hands scorched skin and pustules.Weirs emphasis on the hypothermic rigors of the trek the starvation the dehydration is at least for a while welcome in a genre that often skimps on the real stuff. But the downside is that the detailing takes over the movie. The characterizations of the people on this long slog - they are eventually joined by an orphaned Polish girl (Saoirse Ronan) - are far less delineated than their dermatological condition.Another more fundamental problem is that once the prisoners escape their only real antagonist is the weather. They are always hiding out for pursuers who never arrive. Theres an absurdist Beckett-like aspect to all this although Im not sure this is what Weir was reaching for. More likely he was emphasizing the weather-as-antagonist scenario because he realized he didnt have any other options (although since much of this material is made up anyway why didnt he?). Once we leave the gulag the bad guys are the sun the earth rocks ice.Weir has an epic imagination but unlike say David Lean he doesnt fill out the epic vision with epic characters. The result is a film that seems simultaneously grand and skimpy. For all its faults its an honorable effort though. I hope Weir doesnt wait seven more years for his next film.

"The Way Back review An old-fashioned epic by director Peter Weir |       NJ.com comments The Way Back review An old-fashioned epic by director Peter Weir Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 21 2011 at 753 AM View/Post Comments The fugitive group contemplate how best to avoid being noticed by the farmworkers in ""The Way Back."" Janusz is a smart young Polish soldier -- which in 1940 with the Soviet and Germans invaders hunting down both patriots and intellectuals makes him doubly condemned. In the end its the Soviets who get him -- and give him 20 years in a Siberian gulag. Its a living death sentence. But like so many of his countrymen Janusz has a stubborn faith and a belief in the most impossible of battles. So he gathers some desperate prisoners and stages a break with only one simple plan to walk to freedom. And thats the simple story of ""The Way Back."" Is it a true story? Thats more complicated. Although the film is dedicated to the ""three men"" who made it to freedom the specific 1956 memoir its based on ""The Long Walk"" has been thoroughly disproven. A BBC investigation found hints that others might have made a similar trek -- but no real proof. So approach the film with more than a few grains of salt. Movie Review The Way Back (PG-13) Newmarket (133 min.) Directed by Peter Weir. With Jim Sturgess Colin Farrell Ed Harris. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains strong language and violence. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS Approach it with open eyes though too. Because Peter Weir -- the director of ""Gallipoli"" ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" and other classics along with plenty of recent time-wasters -- has put a story of human dignity and dogged survival on the screen. Jim Sturgess is Janusz who with a stick and a stone can somehow navigate the Gobi desert. Colin Farrell is -- in the liveliest performance -- Valka a brutal gangster. Ed Harris is the mysterious Mr. Smith an American emigre picked up during a Stalinist purge. They are all very good. Sturgess has a resolve here he hasnt shown before and Farrell -- who never seems happier than when hes playing someone unwashed and half-mad -- tears into his role with gusto. And at this point Harris his face weathered into some kind of beautiful wind-whipped sculpture has to do little more than stand and stare. Yet for a film that should have the sweep of a David Lean epic ""The Way Back"" seems oddly hemmed in not only pictorially (unlike ""Lawrence of Arabia"" where the sand had a life of its own) but emotionally. Characters freeze to death drop of sunstroke and we feel ... little. The storys interesting -- the two-plus hours go by quickly -- but unlike """""" say its rarely really involving. Thats because theres little human conflict; Sturgess never doubts himself and the men mostly get along; even Farrells gangster is on best behavior. (When a young teenager appears shes soon accepted and treated like a daughter; the real-life threat of rape never appears.) In some ways -- with its stalwart hero international locations and unshrinking attack on Communism -- ""The Way Back"" is a lot like the movies they just dont make anymore. Unfortunately Peter Weir hasnt quite figured out how to make them today.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 21 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Jan. 20 2011 308PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Typically any real-life tale of the Soviet Gulag is as bleak as the Siberian surroundings and the result is a cold political allegory or a dark existential tract. But veteran director Peter Weir has something more transcendent in mind here. Drawn loosely from a true story The Way Back is an escape yarn that morphs into an extreme adventure odyssey. Covering 4000 miles from frozen tundra and mosquito-infested bogs through scorching deserts and daunting peaks the movie makes for quite a hike. Its also at times a bit of a slog. This time out our Odysseus is a Polish officer named Janusz (Jim Sturgess sporting a come-and-go accent) who begins as a victim of the Hitler/Stalin pact early in the Second World War. Captured by the Russians hes packed off to the Gulag where the film settles into its brief first act the confinement. Weir quickly sketches in the brutal conditions - fighting over crusts of bread slave labour in the mines the political prisoners who languish in the camp the hardened criminals who run it. Among the latter is Valka (Colin Farrell) a Communist by choice and a psychopath at heart. Hell knife a comrade in the gut for the shirt on his back. A curiosity of history theres even a Yank in the crowd. During the Depression several thousand Americans followed the promise of work straight to Moscow only to be stripped of their citizenship and exposed to the Stalinist purges. Meet Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) a long way from home. After a few more intros to two other Poles and a Latvian the confinement phase gives way to the great escape. Actually the relatively easy escape. In these remote parts iron bars definitely do not the prison make. As a guard bluntly puts it ""Siberia is your prison nature is your prison."" So on a winter night seven men including Valka (they need his knife) walk into the snow and into the third and longest phase of the movie the journey. Cue the litany of hardship and suffering. The freedom of India is far off and natures dangers are a constant companion. If it isnt hypothermia on the steppes its sunstroke in the Gobi. Legs swell feet bleed heads hallucinate and always hunger gnaws. A pack of wolves are chased off their carrion and replaced by a pack of men feeding with the same raw abandon. Happily en route they meet Irena (Saoirse Ronan) a lost waif and fellow traveller whose addition to the band serves two useful purposes Her innocence inspires the guys to a greater generosity of spirit; and her gender pretties up an otherwise all-male cast. Weir whose own resume travels extensively from Gallipoli and Witness to Dead Poets Society and The Truman Show checks off each disaster like the old pro he is making the hardship palpable. Also theres some obvious suspense to be mined here Who among the eight will make it? Speaking of death Weir does it very well - the expiring scenes are eerily quiet a slow surrender in the battle with the elements. However the group psychology usually so crucial in these sorts of survival adventures is disappointingly thin here and thus robs the cast members of any chance at a nuanced performance - mainly theyre just moveable pins on a big map. That explains why the movie occasionally feels as wearisome as the journey and can start to seem like a travelogue with unlucky tourists - if its Tuesday it must be Mongolia and ho-hum another damned sandstorm. Consequently the end arrives as an anticlimax that Weirs final montage - updating us on the Soviet Unions decline and fall - does nothing to alleviate. Yes The Way Back is fascinating until it becomes an ordeal.

I am less tantalized in general by anything having to do with a Siberian Gulag which is the starting point for the 68-year-old Weirs latest film a testament-to-the-human-spirit epic called The Way Back on the grounds that fiction about Gulags tends to punish more than just its characters. But even if I didnt have Picnic to encourage my interest Weir has a few other major directorial calling cards like Witness and The Year of Living Dangerously. Failing all else memories of Gallipoli his very fine World War I movie would get me to the Gulag. Perhaps it is fitting that the most recent of these hallowed titles was released 26 years ago. The Way Back is itself an old fashioned venture about a ragtag group of valiant determined prisoners during World War II who make an almost superhuman effort to escape Siberia on foot -- across Mongolia through the Gobi Desert into China and onward into British-controlled India (you can never put too many miles between you and an angry Stalin). The tale is not strictly speaking a true one it is based on a disputed 1956 ""memoir"" called The Long Walk The True Story of a Trek to Freedom by Slavomir Rawicz who claimed to have walked from Siberia to Persia. Screenwriter Keith Clarke in researching the script became convinced Rawicz based the book on other true journeys but did not make the trek himself. (Clarke found evidence of four Poles who did go all the way to India.) The movie stars Jim Sturgess the actor best known for playing Jude in Across the Universe. Here he does a fine job as the sturdy Janusz a Polish man accused of spying on the occupying Soviets. He escapes from the Gulag and because of his outdoorsman skills becomes the defacto leader of his fellow escapees -- a motley crew including one genuine and dangerous criminal Valka (Colin Farrell) a Russian who possesses a handy knife and is thus worth putting up with. There is also Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) an unfriendly American engineer who came to Russia to work on the Moscow metro and was tossed into the Gulag during the purges. An artist named Tamasz (Alexandru Potocean) an innocent named Kasik (Sebastian Urzendowsky) a Latvian priest Voss (Gustaf Skarsgard) and a funny Yugoslav named Zoran (Dragos Bucur) round out the gang. People are lost along the way -- Siberia tends to take a toll -- but near the shores of the vast Lake Baikal they pick up another companion a young Polish teenager named Irena (Atonements Saoirse Ronan). Her femininity loosens them all up a bit a predictable narrative turn nearly obscured by Ronans believable performance. With her sharp somehow period-appropriate features and convincing accent she fits right in especially in her scenes with Harris. He could probably do a part like this -- stoic smart reserved -- in his sleep but no one should discount his expertise simply because he makes it look so easy. As for Farrell if you have to slog a few thousand miles on foot having a companion as interesting as his Valka is essential. It is overwhelmingly satisfying to see Farrell continue the career rebound that began with In Bruges. A challenging off-beat choice like this is worth a dozen Miami Vices. This is not to say The Way Back is flawless. As the journey lengthens key details (like food procurement) seem skimmed over and overall there is the sense that the project was a vehicle for big dreams -- Oscar campaigns for everyone -- that faded before the film was even finished. The last five minutes featuring a pair of disembodied feet stomping across the screen to signify the passage of time and historical events are unbearably clumsy and dont mesh with the rest of the film. A plug feels pulled you imagine someone in possession of the purse strings tapping their foot impatiently while Weir worked frantically to pull it all together. (And he must have been frantic; The Way Back is his first film since 2003s Master and Commander and clearly a labor of love.) Still the overall metaphor Weir was aiming for -- this idea of enemies so powerful and a war so menacing and confusingly big that no place seems safe except a place absurdly far away -- comes through clearly and stays with you.

In ""The Way Back"" ""The Great Escape"" meets the great out doors A title informs us at the outset that in 1941 three men walked over the Himalayas and into India -- after a 4000-mile stroll that began in a Siberian prison camp. Stirring as it frequently is ""The Way Back"" is a good movie that should have been a classic considering its ingredients -- the respect for majesty from ""Master and Commander"" director Peter Weir and the horror of the communist gulag perhaps the most monumental subject still virtually unexplored in big-budget movies. The film largely misses its opportunities to reflect the enormity of communism choosing instead the route of a conventional adventure yarn. Every time it reminds you of another movie -- ""Doctor Zhivago"" ""Reds"" ""Papillon"" -- it slightly suffers from the comparison. Still as a Polish man (Jim Sturgess) absurdly charged with being a counterrevolutionary spy leads a crusty American inmate (Ed Harris) and a career thug (Colin Farrell) out of the smaller man-made prison and into the even more inhospitable natural one of Siberia ""The Way Back"" wells with somber powers. Its a big and vivid film alive with courage and strength and silence and landscape all of them neglected values these days at the cinema. The three men and several others put together a plan to escape during a snowstorm that will cover their tracks. Janusz (Sturgess) grew up hunting and foraging and thanks to tricks like using tree bark with eye-slits as balaclavas they put their human tormentors in the distance. As the film makes its careful way across a gorgeously realized series of tableaus the group will face every plague from hypothermia to sunstroke. Trying to re-create even a taste of the gulag though means a level of self-contradiction. Men contract night blindness from lack of vitamins nearly freeze to death on a routine work detail and stab each other over a sweater -- and I couldnt help noticing that Weir is sweetening the truth. The Farrell character for instance who proudly bears a chest tattoo of Lenin and Stalin (gangsters respect each other) is at first a savage but gradually turns into a softie as does Harriss mysterious American who is so wary he tells his fellow escapees his name is ""Smith."" First name? ""Mister."" Several references to the nurturing power of art -- rapt prisoners listening to a retelling of ""Treasure Island"" or admiring sketches -- give Weir a running subtext. But how much use is a fairy tale against Stalinism? There is an almost Spielbergian sense of sentiment in these scenes. Weir is at his finest when he steps back from the details of the trek and gazes through a surreal lens as when the men are graced -- or besieged or bewitched -- by fantasy visions of home. Their inner fortitude is palpable particularly in the case of Janusz who was sent to Siberia when his own wife denounced him after being tortured. The simplest lines like ""I sit for a minute"" -- in the snow amid murderously low temperatures -- take on a grandeur to match the lush photography and the subtly potent score. When the group is joined by a girl (""Lovely Bones"" star Saoirse Ronan whose ironclad self-assurance is getting tedious) the tension deflates a little and there is even space for a few comic moments. These are not unwelcome but Weirs rhythm is uncertain. We learn how the fugitives defeat lice and mosquitoes but there is only a glimpse of how they manage to get over the Himalayas -- because by this point the movie is more than two hours old and everyones checking his watch. There is so much to put into ""The Way Back"" that much must be left out. What is there provides a refreshing sense of the epic -- of indomitable personalities defining themselves on historys large canvas. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next MTVs new show Skins under fire for potential child porn...

Starring Colin Farrell Mark Strong Saoirse Ronan Ed Harris Jim Sturgess Director Peter Weir Running time 212 Release Opened Jan 21 2011  Editorial Review An improbable compelling sagaBy Dan KoisFriday January 21 2011""Its not our guns or wire or dogs that form your prison. Siberia is your prison"" a Soviet official proclaims to a miserable collection of prisoners new to the gulag in Peter Weirs historically dubious but dramatically compelling story of escape and endurance ""The Way Back."" The official points at the windswept snowy forests that surround the camp. ""Nature is your jailer"" he continues ""and she is without mercy.""But in 1940 one of those prisoners Janusz (Jim Sturgess) leads an improbable escape from the remote prison 4000 miles on foot from Siberia to India. How improbable? Youd never believe it if it werent for the movies assurances that its based on a true story. And since those assurances are suspect -- at best ""The Way Back"" is based on Slavomir Rawiczs discredited memoir ""The Long Walk"" and at worst a tall tale -- it may be just a little too improbable. Weirs movie is superbly made but its fancy-dancing around history gives a hint of inauthenticity to a film that otherwise thrives on its reverence for historical detail.Janusz and his fellow prisoners must endure the cold as nights in the Siberian steppes can reach 40 below. Then theres the unrelenting thirst of the Gobi Desert. Theres hunger; in one memorable scene they chase a pack of wolves away from a fresh kill then descend upon the carcass wild animals themselves. Theres even a plague of mosquitoes which swarm the poor escapees unceasingly and nearly drive them mad. (That detail might strike viewers as overblown but anyone who has read Ian Fraziers recent ""Travels in Siberia"" will wince remembering his vivid description of Siberian mosquitoes pouring from the sky ""as if shot from a fire hose."")Not all the escapees will reach their destination. (Thats no spoiler; an opening caption says as much and even if it didnt the screenplay by Weir and Keith Clarke does an excellent job laying out the steep odds.) But in their long and difficult journey through taiga and sand over mountains and under the Great Wall they all achieve a certain heroic stature. Even if they must die as Janusz points out before the trek begins at least theyll die free.Standouts in the international cast include Colin Farrell as a Russian criminal with a big knife and the exceptional Romanian actor Dragos Bucur (""The Death of Mr. Lazarescu"") as an accountant with a quick wit. The touching Saoirse Ronan (""Atonement"") plays Irena a Polish orphan who joins the trek along the way.Best of all is Ed Harris playing a reserved American engineer named Smith and not just because Weir can explore the weathered crags of his face as if they were the valleys of the Gobi Desert. Smith warns Janusz that the Poles kindness might be the end of him but when Smith forms a bond with Irena Harris shows how the water of affection can enliven even the most sere of deserts.Thats not to say that theres much hugging and bonding in ""The Way Back""; the movie is blissfully free of heroic speeches swelling music cues or overwrought death scenes. Weir has always been interested in men made small fighting against the vastness of the world whether its the Australian outback of ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" the raging seas in ""Master and Commander"" or the artificial universe of ""The Truman Show."" Long wordless stretches of ""The Way Back"" take that theme to its endpoint with Weirs camera capturing the pitiful crew as they struggle across the momentous beautiful landscapes.""The Way Back"" diligently catalogs the outrages through which extreme cold hunger and thirst put the body and Weirs camera finds the terrible beauty in his actors chapped lips windburned cheeks and tenderized feet.But is an astonishing true story as impressive when it isnt exactly true? The movie opens and closes with documentary footage of the Soviet spread through Eastern Europe and places its characters definitively within that historical context. But a recent BBC radio documentary suggests that Rawicz author of the 1956 book ""The Long Walk"" never escaped from the gulag. Perhaps his story belongs to another or perhaps he made it up.In interviews Weir is careful to refer to ""The Long Walk"" as a novel and the film as fiction; the movie itself and its advertising campaign fudge it. (The films National Geographic imprimatur adds to the confusion.) ""Inspired by real events"" the poster proclaims which sounds better than ""Inspired by apocryphal events that may or may not have actually happened.""Does it matter? It shouldnt I guess ""The Way Back"" is a compelling movie. In fact its an uplifting complicated work of art from a director whose ability to tell intimate stories on a big historical canvas is unmatched in Hollywood. While viewers who prize veracity will quibble with the films framing of this unlikely tale those who value cracking storytelling will find much to love.Contains violent content depiction of physical hardships a nude image and brief strong language.

"The Way Back gets a little lost on the trip - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs The Way Back gets a little lost on the trip Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge AP A very long march Colin Farrell left and Ed Harris are among escapees from a Soviet gulag who hike more than 4000 miles to freedom. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Way Back   1/2 (out of four) Stars Jim Sturgess Ed Harris Colin Farrell Saoirse RonanDirector Peter WeirDistributor Newmarket FilmsRating PG-13 for violent content depiction of physical hardships a nude image and brief strong languageRunning time 2 hours 13 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Way Back with its epic story and spectacularly bleak setting invites comparisons with Laurence of Arabia and Dr. Zhivago. Its awash in vast unforgiving terrain. So it got the setting right but not necessarily the substance. Even when not being compared with those classics it falls short in character development. Locations in Bulgaria India and Morocco lend an authenticity to the tale of escaped Soviet prisoners and their struggle to survive. There are exhilarating moments and there are some undeniably tense scenes. Mixed in however is possibly more trudging than youre going to see in any other film. MORE Ed Harris takes the long way back Peter Weir is a masterful director. His first film 1981s Gallipoli was a stunning war epic. Even more commercial fare like The Truman Show (1998) and his last film 2003s Master and Commander have a singular artistry. Loosely based on the true story of prisoners who escape a Siberian gulag the story follows several men and a young girl across a treacherous 4000 miles including forbidding Siberian landscape and Mongolias vast Gobi Desert. The era is circa World War II and the characters include Polish prisoner Janusz (Jim Sturgess) Russian thug Valka (Colin Farrell) American loner Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) and young Irena (Atonements Saoirse Ronan). One in their group goes blind in the woods as they brave freezing temperatures and limited food and water. Others fight off hungry wolves and contemplate cannibalism. Inspired by the 1956 book The Long Walk The True Story of a Trek to Freedom the movie ricochets between inspirational and tedious. No doubt the actual journey had a similar duality. But the film at more than two hours feels overly long. Except for moments of aching despair individual characters are not given distinct traits. They exhibit varying degrees of resourcefulness but their personalities are drab lost in the blizzards and grinding sandstorms which make much more vivid impressions. Irish actor Farrells dialogue feels particularly forced. In a thick Russian accent he says things like ""Weve been going in circles like chicken without head."" Screenwriter Keith Clarkes script is filled with similarly awkward cliches and hackneyed pep talks. Still its an ambitious project. Weir meticulously researched the first-person accounts of those who made the journey. This hike from hell lasted a year no doubt drawing on reserves of endurance. Moviegoers may have to dip into their own reserves to see them through this film. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Life in the Gulag is tough- but the ruling <<Urki<< have the upper hand in ""The Way Back."" Photo Newmarket Films The Way Back review harsh heartening journey 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Way Back Drama. Starring Jim Sturgess Ed Harris Saoirse Ronan and Colin Farrell. Directed by Peter Weir. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres something loving about ""The Way Back"" and its portrayal of a group of rough men escaping from a Stalinist gulag in 1941. This latest from director Peter Weir is based on a purportedly real-life account - its veracity has been disputed - about a group of men who fled a Siberian prison and trekked thousands of miles to safety in India. Whether its true or not this portrait of desperate determined people surviving blizzards and dust storms and crossing mountains and deserts is a gruff and uplifting celebration of how much people can take and how much they value freedom. The audience knows going in that a number of the escapees will survive. Whats answered over the course of the narrative is who survives and how. As Russell Boyds remarkable cinematography emphasizes the dwarfing grandeur of the surrounding topography Weir shows how the corresponding smallness of individuals is compensated for by the grandeur of their aspiration. A number of elements ring true - they feel like details from real-life experience. For example a young Pole (Jim Sturgess) meets a fellow prisoner in his first days in the camp who tells him of an escape plan hes had for months. As a viewer you expect this man will be part of the eventual escape but instead he is in the description of another prisoner a spiritual vulture who feeds on other peoples hopes. Related Stories The Way Back The Pole turns out to be a country boy with a mastery of navigation. When he flees the camp its with a group of men including Ed Harris as a hard-bitten American known as Mr. Smith and Colin Farrell as an animal-like Russian gangster. Farrell probably gives a good performance here - certainly its strenuous - though for some reason whenever hes not onscreen I found myself happy not to see him. Sturgess is steady the moral locus of the film and Harris is remarkable expressing much life experience disappointment and stoic acceptance through a minimum of means. A Russian orphan a teenager played by Saoirse Ronan joins the men at one point in their journey and Harris response to the girl - his journey from suspicion to an almost fatherly concern - is handled with restraint. Weir is a hearty director a he-man director in terms of his subject matter but that restraint that innate good taste is a hallmark of his work and is very present here. Though talking about the movie inevitably leads to a description of its inspirational qualities there is nothing corny or effortful or remotely Hallmark-like about anything in ""The Way Back."" Weir instills emotion in the audience not by showing emotion but by showing action and by holding emotion in check. One example of many One character stands by the grave of another. We prepare ourselves for an emotional close-up of the grieving face. But no Weir gives us the moment in a very distant long shot so that if were not paying attention we might not know which character is having this moment. We feel it without Weir telling us to feel it. If he told us we might feel less. -- Advisory Violence privation distress.

"Movie review The Way Back a bit of a trudge | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMovie review The Way Back a bit of a trudgeThe Soviet prison guard tells his frozen charges at the outset of The Way Back exactly what theyre up against. Guns dogs and barbed wire are the least of their worries.Ed Harris stars in The Way Back.  (AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 20 2011 Peter Weirs The Way Back does a stellar job of putting us in the footsteps of men walking thousands of miles to freedom but their minds remain mostly closed. The Way Back (out of 4) Starring Ed Harris Jim Sturgess Colin Farrell and Saoirse Ronan. Directed by Peter Weir. 133 minutes. At the Varsity. PG The Soviet prison guard tells his frozen charges at the outset of The Way Back exactly what theyre up against. Guns dogs and barbed wire are the least of their worries. Its World War II its winter in Siberia -- all five million square miles of it -- and Mother Nature carries the biggest whip. ""Nature is your jailer and she is without mercy"" the guard says. Whod have expected such poetry from a Stalin stooge? But he does helpfully outline what Peter Weir is up to with The Way Back the Aussie directors first feature in seven years. In telling the story of a 6500-kilometre trek by Soviet prison escapees from Siberia to India hes interested more in the physical exertion than the mental or emotional one. Despite a strong cast that includes Ed Harris Jim Sturgess Colin Farrell and Saoirse Ronan we never really get to know any of the sloggers. Its almost as if Weir and co-screenwriter Keith Clarke were heeding the words of Mr. Smith Harriss grumpy American PoW (""Dont call me comrade ""). ""Theres no room for sentimentality"" Smith barks. ""Kindness ... it can kill you here."" We do though feel every frozen (and later fried) footstep across the ice snow and sand doggedly retracing a route from Siberia through the Gobi Desert and the Himalayas to India that Slavomir Rawicz described in his 1956 bestseller The Long Walk the movies source novel (it was originally published as a factual memoir but the facts got muddied over the years). Weir is capable of character-driven stories; Witness and Dead Poets Society certainly proved that. But hes more at home showing people battling harsh environments both natural and artificial Picnic at Hanging Rock The Mosquito Coast Master and Commander The Truman Show. As a director Weir is definitely old school with no desire whatsoever to turn isolation into art as Gus Van Sant did with his existential trek pic Gerry. He is least certain when depicting the interior struggle that these men face leaving it to us to infer most of it. We come closest to understanding Sturgess Janusz a Polish PoW who we meet at the outset as a soldier betrayed by his terrified wife whose own freedom requires that she turns stoolie against her officer husband. Janusz is the soul of The Way Back Harris the brain and Farrells Russian gangster character Valka is the brawn. The heart belongs to Saoirse Ronans Irena a Polish farm girl who joins the ragged travellers on their track Smiths warnings against sentimentality having fallen upon deaf ears. Yet all these characters are little more than symbols flagstones on the long path towards freedom with the drama as fleeting as the accents of actors. I kept wondering why none of the men including Farrells nutso Valka show no interest whatsoever in Irena as a woman. (Weirs answer to this when I asked him is that exhaustion precluded any thoughts of sex.) What more motivation or nuance does one need you might ask than simply a quest for freedom? Its a good point one that youll have ample time to reflect on during The Way Backs 133-minute running time. Still you cant help but wishing there were more of a story to this otherwise stirring saga of man against nature.

By Joe Morgenstern Updated Jan. 21 2011 1201 a.m. ET The prospect was iffy at best a romantic comedy from a Hollywood studio with a premise that smacked of ""Last Tango in Paris"" the scandalous classic in which Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider have a sexual liaison with no strings--or names--attached. Yet the outcome is delightful. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman are the lovers in ""No Strings Attached"" which Ivan Reitman directed with great verve and unflagging finesse from a terrifically funny script by Elizabeth Meriwether. These lovers do have names Adam and Emma. Theyre longtime friends who decide to become FWBs--friends with benefits i.e. sex friends--because they dont think they can handle the demands of a committed relationship without wrecking their cherished friendship. In fact its more complicated than that and much more interesting but their earnest entry into a no-strings pact is enough to put them on a bumpy raunchy--sometimes very raunchy--and pot-holed road to true love. ENLARGE Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman in No Strings Attached. Paramount Pictures Adam is an aspiring writer on a cheerfully silly TV show about high schoolers ""who sing dance and blog."" Emma is a doctor which is why she tells him at one point ""You give me premature ventricular contractions--my heart skips a beat."" The movie doesnt miss a beat be it comical farcical emotional or even lyrical. (Well maybe one--a change of heart announced by Emma in the courtyard of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art that seems to have happened off camera.) This success is due in huge part to the beautifully tuned work of its co-stars to the lilt of their verbal--and yes physical--duets. Both of the actors like their characters seem to be enjoying themselves with a graceful sense of self-irony that inoculates them against narcissism. Mr. Kutchers Adam is an intelligent good-hearted hunk whos genuinely lovable. Ms. Portmans Emma has a gift for floating and darting while staying grounded. Still actors cant do what these two do without gifted people around them. The director Mr. Reitman (thats Reitman pere of ""Ghost Busters"" not Reitman fils of ""Up in the Air"") sustains precise and often delicate comic rhythms yet he also allows for enjoyable looseness in scenes that can use it. (Some of my favorites involve a special musical mix that Adam burns for Emma a congratulatory balloon that he brings for her and an interlude on a miniature golf course.) The writer Ms. Meriwether (no grounds for confusion here; its her feature-film debut) keeps the zingers coming with remarkable regularity and almost eerie accuracy. More than that though she has created a heroine with substantial if unstressed depth. Far from a flirty beauty who wants to keep her options open Emma keeps her distance from open feelings because she hasnt learned how to do otherwise. ""Im not an affectionate person"" she says in a girlhood prologue. Thats before she blossoms forth as Natalie Portman but even then Emma knows herself all too well. In keeping with the quality at the top of the bill the supporting cast is chockablock with comic chops Kevin Kline as Adams father Alvin a fatuously lascivious actor whos famous mainly for saying ""Great Scott""; Greta Gerwig as Emmas quick-witted friend Patrice; Lake Bells Lucy a major-league neurotic producing minor-league TV; Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges as Adams cheerfully profane and dependably obtuse friend Wallace. ""No Strings Attached"" doesnt have the overexposed washed-out look of a studio comedy--the cinematographer was Rogier Stoffers--and doesnt for a moment feel like one. Its a smart sexy romcom that turns the neat trick of staying sweetly human. The Way Back Watch a clip from the film The Way Back starring Ed Harris and Colin Farrell. Peter Weirs latest film (he directed ""Master and Commander"" ""The Truman Show"" and ""Gallipoli"" among many others) takes us--on foot--from a Siberian gulag in 1940 to India by way of Siberian wastes to the south then much more Siberia east of Lake Baikal Mongolia and finally the Himalayas and Tibet. The journeys length is reflected in its visual sweep and unfortunately in its pace and its 133-minute running time. ""The Way Back"" was inspired by the Slavomir Rawicz novel ""The Long Walk The True Story of a Trek to Freedom."" How much the books truth was embellished by fiction continues to be a subject of debate. Yet theres cumulative power in the tale part prison break and part survival epic of a group of political prisoners led by a young Polish cavalry officer Janusz (Jim Sturgess) who escape from their Soviet captors only to suffer dreadful hardships in a year-long quest for freedom. ENLARGE Saiorse Ronan foreground in The Way Back. Newmarket Films Most of those hardships are familiar to movie lovers; thats a reductionist view of a serious and ambitious production but it is after all a movie on a screen. (And a movie with a dreadfully clumsy ending.) How many new ways can you dramatize icy gales parched deserts agonizing thirst shimmering mirages? And how do you step up the pace of a story thats about people walking? It helps when some Mongolian horsemen come galloping out of nowhere. It also helps to think that real people may have achieved this but that nagging question is how real they were. The movies most interesting element is the civilizing effect of a young woman Irena (Saoirse Ronan) who joins the group partway through their journey or if you will their pilgrimage. Irena is the one who incites her male companions to kindness and who elicits touching stories that help them learn about one another. (Shes an equally useful device for the director and Keith Clarke. They wrote the screenplay which is generally sparse on characterization as opposed to behavioral characteristics.) Russell Boyd did the spectacular cinematography. The admirable cast includes Ed Harris and Colin Farrell who sports flamboyant side-by-side tattoos of Lenin and Stalin on his chest. Summer Wars Watch a clip from the Japanese animated film Summer Wars. The official Japanese entry for an animated-feature Oscar ""Summer Wars"" enlivens second- or third-rate storytelling with patches of first-rate animation. The dubbed English dialogue is awful--the acting and writing not the accents--while the plot is an unmanageable melange of domestic drama plus cyber attack impending apocalypse flashy avatars immersive video games and artificial intelligence running amok. The teenage hero Kenji is both a math genius and a generic nerd who lives for and mostly in an online community called Oz. (Imagine ""Dungeons amp; Dragons"" crossed with ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."") Hes invited by a pretty girl just like that to spend a few days at her ancestral home impersonating her fiance for the benefit of her dying grandmother. Then just like that Kenji is called upon to save the world when a rogue program called Love Machine acquires an orbiting nuclear weapon. ENLARGE A scene from Summer Wars GKIDS/Summer Wars Film Partners Japans abiding fear of nuclear weapons continues to inform its popular culture so its not surprising to find that element surfacing yet again in this storyline. Still I found ""Summer Wars"" scary on very different grounds--as an unwitting example of the mindset its depicting. The script takes a mildly satiric stance toward a new world order in which the disjointed abstractions of online life have pretty much replaced the traditions of social interaction. Whats scary is how disjointed the movie itself proves to be. Its as if the people who made it were determined to confirm our fears of what computers are doing to kids minds. The filmmakers cant keep the strands of their clumsy plot straight but they create brilliant images and manipulate them with blithe abandon. Oz is a vastness of white space that teems with toylike objects teraflopping monsters and gladiatorial avatars that owe more to Aztec esthetics than to the glum denizens of ""Tron."" A vision like this could make you want to stop making sense. DVD FOCUS Beautiful Girls (1996) ENLARGE Beautiful Girls French Kiss and Greenberg Natalie Portman is sensational as Marty a hyperverbal nymphet in this comedy that the late Ted Demme directed from Scott Rosenbergs original screenplay. ""Clearly Ms. Portman is en route to stardom"" I wrote in my review; ""she steals this picture from a large and talented cast."" The picture centers on blue-collar buddies who are thwarted in work as well as love; theyre off to the side of the information highway plowing driveways for a living in the dead of winter. The cast includes Matt Dillon Lauren Holly Timothy Hutton Rosie ODonnell Michael Rappaport Mira Sorvino and Uma Thurman. French Kiss (1995) Kevin Kline does a parody of French cliches as Luc a Gallic con man in this Lawrence Kasdan farce. Meg Ryan is the sorely tried Kate who flies to Paris in pursuit of her wayward fiance. This sort of film is sometimes likened to a souffle--whether risen or fallen will depend on your feelings about Ms. Ryans recipe for pert. Mr. Klines performance turns on elated virtuosity. He gets laughs just by pronouncing his characters name. The uninspired plot turns on a stolen necklace that Luc plants in Kates handbag to get it through customs. Greenberg (2010) Greta Gerwig gives a portrayal of heartbreaking delicacy as Florence Marr the wistful young heroine of Noah Baumbachs remarkable comedy. ""Ive gotta stop doing things just because they feel good"" Florence says although theres no evidence she feels truly good about anything. She feels properly anxious about an emerging love affair with Roger Greenberg a middle-aging misanthrope played with intransigent brilliance by Ben Stiller. Still Florence is joyous compared to Roger whose anger is matched only by his narcissism. ""Greenberg"" scintillates with intelligence razors-edge humor and austere empathy for its struggling lovers. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

The film dramatizes the real-life saga of three prisoners who in 1940 escaped a Soviet prison and walked 4000 miles across Siberia over the Himalayas and on to refuge in India. Four-time Academy Award best director nominee Peter Weir controls the sprawling tale masterfully balancing subtle but unmistakable Christian symbolism against sharp-eyed attention to physical details. After the opening scenes of squalid gulag life you may find yourself itching from psychosomatic bedbug bites. Our surrogate is Janusz (Jim Sturgess) sentenced to the freezing gulag after his wife coerced by torture denounces him as a foreign agent. His fellow inmates are slave laborers felling trees and smashing rocks in the mines; few expect to survive until their far-off release. Echoing a warning speech by the Japanese prison-camp commander in Leans ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" the Russian warden tells the new arrivals that they are imprisoned not by the barbed wire and guards but by the unforgiving wilderness beyond. That may explain the ease with which Janusz and a few comrades breach the wall in mid-blizzard. The escapees include an enigmatic American who calls himself Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) and Valka (Colin Farrell) a vicious criminal and proud Stalinist fleeing prison gambling debts that might cost him his life. When the men and a few others begin their great escape dialogue mostly evaporates. These are hard taciturn men played by actors burrowed in deep. The liveliest exchange is between two haggard pilgrims who squabble over the recipe for an imaginary roast chicken as if it were that nights dinner. Their actual diet is what little they can catch. In Farrells case that means wolfing down a wriggling caterpillar with delirious ecstasy.

Where Lakeville 21 White Bear Township Theatre Rogers 18. There is no search party in pursuit of these insignificant runaways. What imperils them is the harsh terrain brutal weather disease and exhaustion. Cinematographer Russell Boyds evocative long shots reduce the escaped men to the size of the bugs that bedeviled them in the gulag. The deliberately paced film uses silence and vast panoramas of Siberia and the Gobi Desert to emphasize the scope of the journey. It is repetitive to be sure but how else can such an ordeal be represented? There are mild and forgivable moments of plot manipulation. Saoirse Ronan appears as a girl running from a collective farm and her youthful energy gives the group dynamic a jolt of juice. In time though she is worn down by the trek trudging as wearily as the exhausted men. The script largely avoids the neat standard scenes of selfless sacrifice and character revelations. Death plucks off characters with indifferent cruelty. The films religious subtext offers a grace note alongside such rock-ribbed realism. There are allusions to baptism and crucifixion Judas and the good thief halos and crowns of thorns. Janusz is driven to escape so he can offer forgiveness to his wife. The film ends with a misfire a literal march-of-time newsreel that charts the postwar decline of communism as a pair of boots tramps forward across the years to a sentimental and credulity-straining reunion scene. Its an unfortunate finale to a film that covers so much ground with so few stumbles. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

With the possible exception of Terence Malick no one surpasses him in conveying the lure and awe of place and its transforming effects on people.In The Way Back a breathtaking epic Weir chronicles the two-year 4000-mile trek of prisoners who escape from a gulag in Siberia. They walk south to Mongolia across the Gobi Desert and the survivors then make it up into the Himalayas to find sanctuary in Tibet and India. Impossible but true?It is based on a purported memoir by Slavomir Rawicz a Polish army officer sentenced to prison in Siberia by the Soviets in 1939.While it is true that Rawicz was imprisoned in Siberia on trumped-up charges in 1939 there is no evidence that he made the trek himself. He may have heard the story from another survivor of the gulags.Whether it is truth fiction or most likely a little of each the story Weir tells is a powerful parable of mans charge for freedom and his humbling by nature.Weir brackets the film with the individual story of Janusz (Jim Sturgess) a Pole sent to a Siberian gulag in 1939. Mystified by the politics of the prison camp and terrified by the pestilence Janusz is too intimidated to make friends but knows that to survive he must forge alliances.Volka (Colin Farrell) is a logical ally a convict with a knife which could be helpful and a hair-trigger temper which could be hurtful. Mr. Smith (Ed Harris) an American of few words is too enigmatic to show Janusz the ropes. The best bet is a film actor (Mark Strong) whose crime was to make an aristocratic character he played seem too sympathetic.As they freeze through a series of frostbite blizzards the actor inflames Janusz with dreams of escape. This despite their location between impassable forested mountains. ""Nature is your jailer"" warns a prison guard as the men toil in the snow. ""And she is without mercy.""Over the course of his 133-minute epic of courage and survival through numbing cold and blistering heat Weir proceeds to unpack and disprove the guards thesis.Nature is unpredictable and harsh the filmmakers agree. But she is generous in her bounty spectacular in her beauty and provides that human essential freedom.Weir long attracted to stories of those in unfamiliar psychological and physical places finds poetry in the vein on a leaf music in the sound of the pebbles underfoot and a series of dazzling vistas.The filmmaker is fortunate in his clear-eyed collaborator cinematographer Russell Boyd who worked with him on Gallipoli Dangerously and the magical Master and Commander The Far Side of the World.Although both Harris and Farrell are quite fine as is Saoirse Ronan as a young girl the escapees meet near a fairy-tale lake the characters on this trek are a lot less interesting than the landscapes. Weir does not mine them for their scenic properties but for their emotional elements. The result is a one-of-a-kind experience.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Is Peter Weir capable of making a bad movie? Maybe not but in a career that has seen ""Picnic at Hanging Rock ""Witness ""The Truman Show and ""Master and Commander ""The Way Back is one of the few thats good rather than great. Its certainly big A sort-of-true story about an epic World War II-era trek from Siberia to India the movies grueling inspiring astonishing to look at. You come out feeling youve traveled half the planet. As ordeal movies go though this ones oddly easy to shake off. The recent ""127 Hours took the audience on a richer emotional journey in one place than ""The Way Back does in 4000 miles.But its earnest and well-acted and sturdily filmed Were in good hands and we know it. As Janusz the ardent young Polish officer consumed with the idea of escaping from a Soviet gulag and walking to freedom Jim Sturgess (""Across the Universe) is an appealing team leader with deep survival skills. When in the middle of a raging Russian blizzard he outfits the other escapees with birch bark masks were seeing the will to live joined to knowledge and creativity.Januszs skills can only go so far for the journey and for the movie. After the six men flee their prison not far from the Arctic Circle theyre essentially at the mercy of the elements the ecosystems and each other. Weirs script cowritten with Keith R. Clarke brings half the band into sharp focus In addition to Janusz theres a vicious Russian gangster named Valka (Colin Farrell) with survival skills of his own and a mysterious hard-bitten American who calls himself Smith (Ed Harris) and whose story leaks out in pieces throughout the film.The other three travelers are more sketchily drawn each given a single character trait an artist (Alexandru Potocean) a joker (Dragos Bucur) a mystic (Gustaf Skarsgard). Until they sort themselves out midway through the film you might want to call them Manny Moe and Jack. Around Lake Baikal the troupe is joined by Irena (Saoirse Ronan) another Polish escapee from the vast Soviet penal system and the seven voyage south together.The drama in ""The Way Back is almost purely elemental pitting humans against a series of harsh environments to see who wins. Dense subarctic forests are followed by endless plains parching deserts daunting mountains each its own stunning kind of hell. Weir keeps the momentum going on his characters sheer drive occasionally indulging himself with artistic touches -- the moving but heavy-handed Christian symbolism of Irenas scenes for instance -- that feel obtrusive in the primal settings. This story is one of the all-time great treks and it needs few fripperies to engage a viewer.But did it happen? It depends on whom you ask and when. ""The Way Back is based closely on the 1956 book ""The Long Walk told by Slavomir Rawicz to a British ghostwriter and long a cult classic to adventurers and armchair travelers. Rawicz claimed the experience was his -- up to and including a yeti sighting in the Himalayas (not in the movie thankfully) -- but recent efforts have unearthed evidence that casts doubt on his veracity. Even further evidence suggests someone else may have led the journey from gulag to India A Pole named Witold Glinski perhaps or simply men (and one woman) whose names are lost to history.In a recent BBC interview Weir describes being enraptured by the book discovering the truth of the matter (or rather its unknowability) and finally proceeding with what he calls ""essentially a fictional film. You can feel that fuzziness and frustration bedeviling the edges of ""The Way Back Weirs wish (and ours) for the story to be so. We need our epics of human survival -- over the land over the cruelties of other men -- almost more than these heroes need to survive.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Share Tweet Deep into The Way Back Peter Weirs first film since 2003s Master And Commander a drifter (Saoirse Ronan) corners an escaped POW played by Ed Harris and fills him in on the backstories of some of his fellow travelers. Harris has been with many of these men for months even years yet he seems at most marginally curious about their lives though their survival is inextricably connected to his own. Within the context of the film Harris attitude is completely understandable. For the prisoners the past and the future dont matter; all that matters is surviving the perilous present. The brutal realities of their situation have rendered all other concerns irrelevant. Adapted from a memoir of wartime survival by Slavomir Rawicz the veracity of which remains controversial The Way Back casts Jim Sturgess as a Polish soldier sent to a Russian POW camp in Siberia during World War II. In the camp Sturgess and five of his fellow soldiers make a daring escape including a ruthlessly pragmatic Russian criminal played by Colin Farrell as well as Harris brutally unsentimental but ultimately humane American. The prisoners are threatened on all sides. Theres the danger of being caught and executed but also the ever-present possibility of freezing to death in the merciless Siberian cold or perishing from sun heat or dehydration once they reach the Himalayas. Weir gives the film an epic scope framing his characters against giant imposing vistas that highlight how inconsequential they appear against the vastness of nature. But Weirs emphasis on the biggest picture transforms Sturgess the films ostensible protagonist into a blank. He fades into the background because he lacks the magnetism or presence of Farrell who plays his character as a man who has lived like an animal for so long that hes devolved into a borderline-feral state. Weir told the BBC that he considers The Way Back ""essentially a fiction film""; the story of prisoners walking from Siberia to India certainly appears to be too melodramatic to be true but in the end it doesnt particularly matter. Well-acted and artfully (though conventionally) made The Way Back tells a compelling story regardless of whether its based on truth or a fabrication.

Movies The Way Back by Lisa Schwarzbaum Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr MOUNTAIN MAN Colin Farrell has a long walk home in The Way Back Posted January 20 2011 -- 1200 AM EST The Way Back is director Peter Weirs old-fashioned enactment of how a handful of World War II prisoners escaped a Siberian gulag and trekked 4000 miles across the Himalayan mountains to freedom in India. The saga follows a familiar narrative path with mixed results The movie -- the first from the fine Australian filmmaker since his 2003 Master and Commander The Far Side of the World -- is handsome well made and based on a ""true"" story by Slawomir Rawicz the veracity of which has since been challenged. Its also filled with scenes of extraordinary survival challenges. But the result is oddly impersonal and undifferentiated even as some of the escapees perish along the way whether frozen to death or starved or scorched by desert sun and thirst. Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe) plays Janusz a young Polish prisoner with a plan for making his way to the Mongolian border. The band of characters who sign on include a tattoo-festooned gambler and criminal (Colin Farrell being colorful) and an American prisoner (Ed Harris being squinty) whose family had moved to Russia as Communist believers and then lost their faith under the tyranny of Stalin. Along the way theyre joined by a young girl (Atonements Saoirse Ronan) who manages to wring further biographical details from her gruff traveling companions. The scenes of brute survival -- hunting for food improvising shelter making wind-and-snow masks out of sheets of birch bark -- are vivid. The men are not. It spoils nothing to say that Janusz is among those who survive. But even the theoretically inspiring finale is muted by a news-clip-montage quickie history lesson about the late-20th-century reign and collapse of Communism. None of which has anything to do with how hungry men crossed the Himalayas and came out the other side.

"Gulag escapees tale epic the storytelling less so - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Gulag escapees tale epic the storytelling less soThe Way Back a 2 1/2 starsJanuary 20 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic""The Way Back"" is director Peter Weirs first picture since the stirring ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" (2003) a film that looks better every year. His latest is one of his sternest -- though given the subject matter and the films strangely muted impact one suspects Weir and his co-writer Keith Clarke were vexed by a basic storytelling question How much hell do we put the audience through with this one?Its based partly on Slavomir Rawiczs ""The Long Walk"" in which Rawicz (through a ghost-writer) relayed his experiences as a lieutenant in the Polish Army who escaped from a Siberian gulag prison camp. The World War II memoir whose factual veracity has been widely disputed remains in the words of Clarke ""a great adventure story."" It focuses on the lengths Rawicz and six others went to in order to become free men eluding their Soviet captors contending with an excruciating 4000 miles of Siberian forest the plains of Mongolia sandstorms in the Gobi Desert and the Himalayas. Some lived some did not.Weirs film is fiction taking a lot from the memoir and a lot more from other accounts of Soviet gulag survivors. The movie is half prison film and half raw-survival saga photographed in Bulgaria Morocco and India. The entryway character accused Polish spy Janusz (Jim Sturgess) lands in the same lice-ridden camp as an American engineer (top-billed Ed Harris) and a Russian street thug (Colin Farrell) who more or less runs the gulag to his liking. The escapees eventually pick up a Polish refugee (Saoirse Ronan of ""Atonement"" and ""The Lovely Bones"") who some fear will slow down the groups progress.Weir has a way with remote and challenging landscapes. Here though the characters and their interactions are stuck halfway between ""the facts"" or the research used for the script and old-fashioned dramatic necessity. The writing can get pretty prosaic. ""I cant see anything"" one man says at one point adding pointlessly ""The snow is blinding us"" The multinational cast anchored by Harris and Sturgess commits fully to the challenges. But Weir and editor Lee Smith seem preoccupied with hustling events along and nervous about boring us for even a second. The result is a brisk trot through a story that is at heart a tough slog.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for language and some sexual content)Cast Ed Harris (Smith); Jim Sturgess (Janusz); Saoirse Ronan (Irena); Colin Farrell (Valka); Mark Strong (Khabarov); Gustaf Skarsgard (Voss)Credits Directed by Peter Weir; written by Weir and Keith Clarke adapted freely from the book ""The Long Walk"" by Slavomir Rawicz; produced by Joni Levin Weir Duncan Henderson and Nigel Sinclair.

This is the inspiring true story of seven desperate prisoners who escaped from a Soviet gulag in Siberia in 1940 during Stalins infamous ""reign of terror"" and set out on a punishing journey across 4500 miles of treacherous terrain through five hostile countries. With few supplies no medicine and only a pocketful of food they seemed doomed from the start but this remarkable film (based on eyewitness accounts and the acclaimed Slavomir Rawicz memoir The Long Walk) is a hymn to their endurance and a chronicle of their journey; it makes you want to cheer. The power of the film is the undeterred passion for freedom shared by this raggedy band of multinationals with nothing else in common. Preferring suicide to slavery and faced with almost certain defeat they endured hardships and learned how to survive through solidarity and it is this that forms the nucleus of a film whose indomitable spirit is contagious. The year it takes them to walk through the snowy subzero landscapes of Siberia to the broiling desert leading into India is an arduous journey not everyone completes and in all fairness I warn you that Mr. Weirs unsparing documentation of their ordeal makes you feel like youre part of the trip. Prolonging life by eating mud caterpillars and snakes and slogging through blizzards frostbite starvation night blindness wolf attacks sandstorms and the constant threat from enemy tribes this courageous gang goes through month after month of trials that really redefine the word ""harrowing."" Hope sinks when they finally reach the safety of the Mongolian border and are dismayed to find the Communists got there first-priests and monks slaughtered Buddhist temples destroyed religious consciences burned along with the villages. The only passage to freedom is now a perilous trip over the Himalayas to Tibet. Some freeze to death and one man is lost forever but the final tally is four excluding the homeless teenage girl they adopt along the way (another performance of honesty and sensitivity by Saoirse Ronan the extraordinary young actress with the unpronounceable name from Atonement and The Lovely Bones). This frail refugees self-assured capacity for enduring whatever it takes to hold her own among the men who rescue her laced with a blind determination to be free forms Christian undercurrents that add to the films human conviction contrasting with Mr. Weirs depiction of a vast untamed wilderness that could only be the work of a higher power. Astoundingly he has created a thrilling backwoods world (captivatingly photographed by the great cinematographer Russell Boyd) populated by a small group of people understandably driven to the edge of sanity. Leading an exemplary cast is the versatile British actor Jim Sturgess who was so memorable in the violent Irish saga Fifty Dead Men Walking. He plays Janusz a Polish political prisoner falsely accused and tortured after being fingered by his own wife (in an act of self-preservation) as a foreign spy. His comrades include a cynical desensitized American named Smith (Ed Harris) and a vicious terrifying Russian gangster named Valka (surprisingly well played by Colin Farrell replete with convincing Slavic accent and tattoos of Stalin and Lenin on his chest). The screenplay by Mr. Weir and Keith Clarke is uncompromisingly tough and crammed with testosterone yet despite the potent danger and epic action that keeps your pulse throbbing there is also time to develop each characters personality until you know them intimately. Pretty amazing for a movie that cost only 29 million. Some may view The Way Back as another well-made but familiar escape epic; others will see it as a footnote to a part of World War II history that American films have largely managed to overlook. But no one will go away disappointed or indifferent. Its a movie that sticks with you like Elmers glue. rreedobserver.com THE WAY BACKRunning time 132 minutesWritten by Peter Weir and Keith R.

Hoberman The Way Back Is a Grueling Trip Wednesday January 19 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman EXPAND Newmarket Films They call it ""human interest."" There are few narratives more compelling than a survival story like Peter Weirs adventure yarn The Way Back unless its the cautionary tale of one who failed to make it as with C. Scott Williss The Woodmans named best documentary at last years Tribeca Film Festival. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The protagonists of The Way Back the veteran directors first movie in the seven years since his seafaring Master and Commander are a group of Soviet prisoners who escape the Gulag during World War II trekking 4000 miles from Siberia to Outer Mongolia across the Gobi Desert over the Great Wall and through the Himalayas to freedom. The source Slavomir Rawiczs The Long Walk was an international bestseller when published in 1956; yeti sightings notwithstanding it was considered a personal memoir for half a century until a BBC reporter established that Rawicz actually had been set free in a 1942 amnesty. Last year another Polish World War II vet declared that The Long Walk was based on his story. The movies press notes handles these discrepancies by characterizing the Rawicz book as a novel.Ending in 1989 with the fall of Communism and thus positioned as a Cold War allegory The Way Back remains a grueling trip--true story or not. After his wife is tortured into denouncing him the young Polish officer Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is sent to an Arctic forced-labor camp where he immediately begins plotting his escape. The Gulag is a museum of cruelty run by tattooed thugs--one guy is casually killed for his sweater--but as bad as humans are nature is scarcely better. The indomitable Janusz helps knock out the prison generator during a snowstorm; along with six others including Colin Farrells tag-along--a cute lil roughneck (added for the movie) with Stalin tattooed on his chest--he busts out into the howling blizzard.The first night one guy goes blind in the woods and winds up frozen solid. Thereafter life is reduced to the essentials--digging for grubs fighting the temptation to turn cannibal battling wolves for scraps of meat. Having made The Year of Living Dangerously Mosquito Coast and The Truman Show Weir is no stranger to challenging situations in exotic locations. The Way Back has no shortage of scenic splendor. What it lacks is drama. As undifferentiated as the escapees are the movie is relatively uninvolving until they are joined by a gangly Polish girl (Saoirse Ronan previously victimized in The Lovely Bones) also on the lam. Her presence precipitates the flowering of backstories and personalities most successfully in the case of Ed Harriss crafty lone-wolf American.Although seldom considered as a movie The Passion of the Christ jump-started a trend in cinema as ordeal United 93 The Death of Mr. Lazarescu Hunger and the Saw series are experiences to be endured. But whatever Weir may think of his onetime protege Mel Gibsons work his hardship drama is stolidly old-fashioned more extreme travelogue than exercise in visceral horror. Rather than suffer for our sins his characters are resourceful if not triumphant paradigms of the human spirit. Theres even a sense in which the movie is about its own logistics although it would take a fanatic like Werner Herzog to turn that into compelling cinema. Still The Way Back does make its point. You wont complain about anything in your life after seeing this movie--at least for the next 15 minutes.jhobermanvillagevoice.com1 Much harder than your commuteNewmarket Films Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

"Movie review The Way Back - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review The Way BackPeter Weir co-writes and directs a tale of escape from a Soviet gulag. The acting and the landscape are bracing the turn toward sentimentality not so much.December 29 2010|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times Colin Farrell stars in ""The Way Back."" (Newmarket Films )A small group of determined survivors walks together toward freedom a through a forest a blizzard a desert across mountains. From this elemental premise comes the basic drama of ""The Way Back"" a based-in-fact tale of a how a handful of prisoners escaped from a Soviet gulag in 1940 and walked some 4000 miles from Siberia to India. The film the first from director Peter Weir since ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" in 2003 and opening Wednesday in a brief local run for awards qualification before returning to theaters next month is by turns rigorously spare bracingly direct and then disconcertingly inclined toward an ill-fitting sentimentality. Shot in India Bulgaria and Morocco the film has the feel of an older vista-strewn adventure yarn that seems purposefully out of step with the green-screen CGId techniques of today. Real people captured simply in real locations provides a palpable feeling that simply would not have been the same had the cast a which includes Ed Harris Colin Farrell Jim Sturgess Saoirse Ronan and Mark Strong offering fine distinctive turns a been wandering around some soundstage in Burbank. That a production this ambitious has been financed and distributed outside the studio system throws a curveball to anyone who thinks ""independent film"" can mean only urban moderns sitting in an apartment bemoaning their ennui. Early in ""The Way Back"" a jailer tells the newly arriving inmates that the gulag itself is only part of what holds them that the roughly inhospitable surrounding area and by extension the world itself is what will really keep them captive. In some ways this is the essential heart of the film a and even arguably the overriding theme of Weirs entire body of work a exploring how much a human can endure and overcome how hard one must push to accomplish a single goal. In one of the films richest most subtly evocative moments Farrells character a Russian criminal allowed along on the journey mostly because he has a knife acknowledges his own limits while also perhaps succumbing to a lack of imagination about himself being ruled by what others have imposed upon him. The story is based on a ""inspired by"" is the actual credit a the 1956 book ""The Long Walk"" by Slavomir Rawicz which has been largely discredited as a true account in the years since its publication. Yet rather than worry about the veracity of Rawiczs memoir Weir working with co-writer Keith Clarke seems to have found a freedom there putting ""The Way Back"" in line with such other recent films as ""The Social Network"" ""Im Still Here"" and ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" which have teasingly trawled and at times discarded the divide between authentic truth dramatic intent and emotional reality. Sadly the films energy dissipates as scene after scene of walking and talking begins to feel awkwardly repetitive. Weir also loses his nerve somehow allowing in sentimental back stories and motivations that are largely absent from the films early going. Harris character an American who came to Russia looking for work in particular becomes less interesting the more information is revealed about him. A brief sequence at the close that builds to a preposterous reunion scene marks the films biggest stumble; this final coda seems to bow to Hollywood convention when what has come before feels designed as a rebuke. Nevertheless as shot by cinematographer Russell Boyd a longtime collaborator of Weirs who won an Academy Award for his work on ""Master and Commander"" ""The Way Back"" demands to be seen on the largest possible screen the better to experience the way it visualizes an essential motivating tension between the small-scale intimacy and drama of its characters and the vast enormity of its landscapes. In many ways it might be identified as a ""small"" film a its from an upstart independent distributor and has had little ad support or a festival presence a but ""The Way Back"" in its best moments is as big as a movie can be as big as life itself. calendarlatimes.com The Way Back MPAA rating PG-13 for violent content depiction of physical hardships a nude image and brief strong language Running time 2 hours 13 minutes Playing At AMC Covina 30 Covina MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESFrame Grab Jim Sturgess novel challenge in One DayAugust 22 2011The Way Back and its long trek to the screenJanuary 22 2011Contender Qamp;A Jim SturgessJanuary 11 2011The Way Back Director Peter Weir returns with a tale of...December 9 2010Quick Takes U.S. ballet troupe visits CubaNovember 3 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentPeter WeirIndependent FilmGulagCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-way-back-20101229,0,264503.story",200,thewayback27,thewayback,latimes

Polish soldier Slavomir Rawiczs memoir The Long Walk describes his 1940 escape from a Siberian gulag across the Gobi desert and over the Himalayas but subsequent doubts over its veracity means Weir uses fictionalised characters for his screen retelling. Compound this with a seeming disjuncture between the films portentous newsreel-heavy historical scene-setting and the elemental drama of the odyssey itself and the viewer is left unhelpfully foggy on where truth ends and dramatic licence begins.Essentially this undercuts the overall emotional impact but on a scene-by-scene basis there are some marvellous things here not least the extraordinary changing landscapes along the epic route. Snowy tundra and desert wastes leave the cast fighting for attention yet in this expansive context its actually the intimately human moments that come off best. Jim Sturgess digs deeper than previously thought possible as the Polish leader of the escape party matched by the cussed cynicism of Ed Harriss ex-pat Yank and indeed Colin Farrells canny turn as a potentially lethal criminal untroubled by his fellow fugitives political motives. Most affecting is Saoirse Ronans waif-like interloper as the going gets seriously tough and Big Questions enter the frame - wheres the line between compassion and self-preservation? Why in essence do we live? Weir certainly earns the right to ponder these issues yet for all the films occasional peaks were left with the sense of a story so incredible even this cinematic visionary is struggling to contain it on celluloid.

After nearly a seven-year absence director Peter Weir makes his long-awaited return with ""The Way Back"" an impressive but not especially immersive true story of four POWs who escaped the Siberian Gulags and crossed the Himalayas on foot to freedom. Acquired by Newmarket Films immediately before its Telluride Film Festival debut this arduous travelogue focuses on the macro (stunning David Lean-like landscapes) and the micro (countless closeups of blistered flesh) to the virtual exclusion of compelling characters. While the name cast should aid overseas prospects American auds wont be going out of their way to experience this long dry slog. Weir who veers from the specifics presented in Slavomir Rawiczs book ""The Long Walk The True Story of a Trek to Freedom"" due to controversies surrounding its authenticity gave himself room to fictionalize the epic journey. But the director clearly finds the voyage more important than the voyagers doing little to dramatically enhance the storys central group of escapees (which includes Jim Sturgess as an alleged Polish spy Colin Farrell as a Russian mobster Ed Harris as an enigmatic American and four other nondescript prisoners). The film opens in Russia-occupied Poland late 1939 to find Janusz (Sturgess) being denounced by his wife and sentenced to hard time in a remote Siberian labor camp -- a frozen hellhole where the elements are just as effective as the guns dogs and fences at discouraging escape. Weir fills these scenes with gritty detail creating a vivid picture of Gulag life in a relatively short time. Between the bedbugs bad food and brutal company its easy to understand why Janusz would rather risk death on the outside though Weir has another idea in mind The protag must survive in order to get back to his wife (despite her betrayal) and the impossibly long journey will not end until he can do so (which explains not only the title but also a strange recurring vision of Janusz reaching for the front door of his home whenever things get tough). Gathering half a dozen other prisoners Janusz makes a break for it during a blizzard (we know from an ill-advised opening card that only three will make it as far as India). Driven by ""kindness"" and a need to forgive Janusz immediately puts his survivalist skills to use on the outside fashioning facemasks from birch bark and using tricks from his hunting days to steer them south. The Russian guards give chase at first but only for a few minutes after which the suspense thaws in favor an all-too-linear account of the 4000-mile hike. This takes the multinational group (whose conversation alternates between their native tongues and thickly accented English) around a mosquito-infested lake across the Great Wall of China through the Gobi Desert to Tibet and finally over the snow-capped Himalayas. Along the way Weir constantly shows the group hiding in bushes as if to avoid detection by the communists they pass along the way but it never feels as if they are in danger of being discovered. With no one in pursuit the real adversary becomes nature itself which threatens them with starvation dehydration hypothermia and a whole range of incredibly nasty foot injuries the director uses to reinforce the impression of unflinching realism. The only person to pay them much mind is a parentless Polish girl (""The Lovely Bones?"" Saoirse Ronan) first seen lurking in the woods. When she begs to join them the groups grizzled pragmatist (Harris) warns that she will become a liability while Farrells character (who resorts to eating bugs at one point) jokes that having more bodies could provide meat if things get dire. Fortunately it never comes to cannibalism and time soon endears the girl to the group. Despite Weirs efforts to make us care about the characters the humans are constantly at risk of disappearing against the immensity of their surroundings. The bigscreen craves images like those in ""The Way Back"" but audiences crave a reason to care and however impressive specific scenes may be (crossing a sheet of thin ice and chasing a desert mirage stand out) for such a singular story the film doesnt feel particularly unique. ""Mongol"" managed to out-Lean ""The Way Back"" on the same turf (offering Genghis Khan as our point of entry) while true cons-on-the-run thriller ""Van Diemens Land"" told of an even more harrowing cross-country trek set in Weirs native Australia. The roles not designated to stars (namely an artist and a comedian in the group) often blur together while the others keep their feelings hidden from one another. Harris ""Mr. Smith"" and Janusz both have deep-seated motives for survival which Weir doesnt reveal until too late.

Daily Edition Login to download The Way Back -- Film Review 1009 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Stephen Farber  AP FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Empty TWITTER Empty TELLURIDE -- Peter Weir is rightly regarded as one of the worlds master filmmakers but he has not made a movie since 2003s ""Master and Commander The Far Side of the World"" which surely reflects the growing challenges for directors who choose to follow an uncompromising artistic path in todays constricted cinematic universe. ""The Way Back"" which had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival is a harrowing epic that will not be an easy sell but it finds Weir again working at the top of his game.As a technical achievement the film -- which ranges from the gulags of Siberia to the Gobi Desert -- is astonishing but it also showcases powerful themes that make it unexpectedly moving and resonant.The script by Weir and Keith Clarke (also the producer who helped to shepherd the project through a decade of development) is inspired by true stories of a few people who escaped from Stalinist labor camps. But Weir emphasizes that the characters in the film are fictional.The Polish protagonist Janusz (Jim Sturgess) is introduced in the opening scene in 1940 when he is interrogated by a Soviet officer who accuses him of espionage. Janusz refuses to confess to the false charges but when his wife is tortured and informs against him Janusz is shipped off to the gulag. There he encounters a number of other disaffected prisoners including an American engineer (Ed Harris) who came to Russia during the 1930s and a hardened criminal (Colin Farrell) all bent on escape.The security system at the gulag is not overwhelmingly efficient because as the commandant informs the new arrivals the biggest deterrent to escape is the unyielding natural environment that surrounds the prison.The least effective parts of the movie are the early scenes in the prison camp partly because these grim scenes are reminiscent of many other movies and also because it takes time to distinguish the important characters many of them played by unknown Russian or Polish actors. After the first half-hour however when Janusz leads a group of seven prisoners into the freezing Siberian forest the film begins to build in intensity. You know that not all of the prisoners will reach their destination but the fates of the individual characters are always surprising and poignant. Along the way they also meet a teenage orphan girl (beautifully played by ""The Lovely Bones"" star Saoirse Ronan) whom they reluctantly allow to join their trek.Working with one of his favorite cinematographers Russell Boyd Weir captures the startlingly varied landscapes that mark their long journey. Among the highlights are the stunning desert scenes (actually filmed in Morocco). Weir and Boyd have clearly taken a look at ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but to say that their images bear comparison with that masterpiece is high praise indeed. A sequence in which the characters pursue a mirage that might or might not lead them to water will be remembered alongside the first appearance of Omar Sharif in ""Lawrence."" A fierce sandstorm that follows is equally memorable.Beyond its visual splendors however the film achieves searing moral power. The most profound question it raises is whether a good man can play a meaningful role during a time of widespread evil. In the prison camp Harris recognizes that Janusz might be an asset during their journey because he senses that Januszs ""kindness"" could aid their survival. Janusz is determined to make it home not because he wants to save his own skin but because he wants to forgive his wife for the betrayal that he knows was forced on her. Januszs nobility is not oversold but it helps to sustain all of the prisoners during their savage journey and it provides an anchor for the audience as well.The films stirring concept depends on the performance of Sturgess who really has the starring role and subtly conveys the soul of a decent man. Harris also gives a superb performance as a bitter man who reclaims his own humanity during the long march. Farrell bravely highlights the loutish ignorance of a hardened thug whose stubborn loyalty to Comrade Stalin is one of his most surprising traits.All of the production credits are first-rate. One might question a coda that teeters on the edge of sentimentality. This film has its flaws but it still stands as a major achievement by one of the great directors of our time.Venue Telluride Film Festival (Newmarket)Cast Jim Sturgess Ed Harris Colin Farrell Saoirse Ronan Mark StrongDirector Peter WeirScreenwriters Peter Weir Keith ClarkeBased on the book by Slavomir RawiczProducers Joni Levin Peter Weir Duncan Henderson Nigel SinclairExecutive producers Keith Clarke John Ptak Guy East Simon Oakes Tobin Armbrust Jake Eberts Edward Borgerding Mohamed Khalaf Adam Leipzig Scott Rudin Jonathan SchwartzDirector of photography Russell BoydProduction designer John StoddartMusic Burkhard DallwitzCostume designer Wendy StitesEditor Lee SmithNo rating 130 minutes FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Stephen Farber THRnewsthr.com thr AP THRnewsthr.com thr Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter (c) 2016 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.
