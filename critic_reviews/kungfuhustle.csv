What this broadly comic adventure most resembles however is a ""Road Runner"" cartoon brought to life. When the actors chase each other down a road they go into hyperdrive traveling at the speed of sound as their unicycle legs leave behind tunnels of cartoon dust. As deliberately artificial as an old studio musical (and it even includes a big dance number) ""Kung Fu Hustle"" defies all laws of gravity in its pursuit of thrills and laughs--and its so disarmingly eager to please that only a stone-faced kung fu purist could object.Chow who wrote directed and stars as a wanna-be gangster is a huge comedy star in Asia where ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is already a smash success. Hes made more than 50 movies though in the United States hes known for only one the kung fu sports comedy ""Shaolin Soccer."" Co-financed by Columbia Pictures and armed with action choreographer Yuen Wo Ping (of ""Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" fame) and an arsenal of computer-generated effects ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is his bid for international success.Its likely to pay off. The plot pits the ruthless members of the Axe Gang who run the corrupt city against the odd and seemingly overmatched denizens of Pig Sty Alley a teeming apartment complex whose inhabitants it turns out possess unearthly fighting skills such as a chain-smoking harridan of a landlady with a scream that can do more than shatter glass. The gang alarmed by this unexpected resistance to its power must hire ever-more-stupendous assassins to take on the quirky old locals while our hero Sing (Chow) morphs from a feckless would-be villain into a hero with supernatural powers. Amid the surreal and nearly nonstop mayhem Chow finds little pockets of poignancy watching these gallant old-timers bite the dust can produce an uncartoonlike pathos. Those moments dont last long however the raucous ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is painted in bold cheerful strokes. Chows martial-arts movie is exuberantly silly.

A chain-smoking harridan (played by Yuen Qiu) in nightie and curlers she can crack glasses with her screeching harangues and can knock guys out cold with her aerial kicks. At one point frustrated with her shiftless husband (Yuen Wah) she cold-cocks him -- sending him bouncing off a canopy below and face first on to the ground. Before Landlord can recover she tosses a clay flower pot onto his head. It breaks and the solitary white rose tumbles out. Ow. The fight scenes in ""Kung Fu Hustle"" are amazingly choreographed. Its from filmmaker Stephen Chow in white.

A martial arts comedy which seems to have been injected with Buster Keatons gymnastic inventiveness Sergio Leones tough-guy posturing and the Three Stooges antic madness ""Kung Fu Hustle"" snaps and crackles like nuclear popcorn on a scorching griddle. Filmmaker Chow who made the hyper-cartoonish comedy ""Shaolin Soccer"" has out-brillianted himself. Set in 1940s (pre-revolutionary) China the story (such as it is) is about a small slummers community (Landladys tenants) who are under the thumb of the Axe Gang -- ruthless individuals who wield (and use) some nasty weapons. Into this world comes Sing (played by Chow) an impoverished opportunist who wants to join the gang so he can shake down the poor too. But hes a catalyst for catastrophe managing to antagonize just about everyone. Sing directly and indirectly incites an escalation of fights involving superhuman feats and thanks to computer-generated imagery some jaw-dropping visual effects. Characters defy gravity in the manner of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" They withstand amazing physical punishment as if theyre the fleshy residents of a Hong Kong-style Warner Bros. cartoon. And their protracted balletic fights -- in this rundown compound known as Pig Sty Alley -- are amazing as kung fu spectacle and for their comic genius. Sings ultimate move for instance is the Palm Move That Falls From Heaven. It involves him skyrocketing above the clouds alighting serenely on a bird then making a slow but deadly descent to earth for the big assault. And then there are the two sinister men of the apocalypse whose stringed harps project darts of powerful energy that can break buildings not to mention unfortunate opponents. No sooner has Chow produced something awesome he reverts back to Stooges sensibility. Theres the time Sing hurls a knife which bounces off a wall and sinks into his shoulder for instance. Or the scene in which Sings tubby friend (Lam Tze Chung) picks up a cage full of snakes to hurl at Landlady and accidentally opens it engulfing Sing with writhing serpents. There are dozens more of these stunts and gags to savor. And after watching this rich choreography of pugilistic mayhem you may feel as though you need to get some down time immediately afterward. But it wont be long before you feel the compulsion to watch again. There is too much to appreciate in one sitting. And this is one gift to yourself that will keep on giving.

"Kung Fu Hustle The Grin Reaper washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Kung Fu Hustle The Grin Reaper Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 22 2005 ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is one of the most buzzed-about comedies to come out this year but for some reason -- the weather? The idiots in the next row talking all the way through the movie? -- its charms eluded me. Admittedly the actor and director Stephen Chow has created a larky energetic homage not just to his own genre but also to all movies everywhere and throughout time. But for all its stylishness verve and moments of visual poetry the relentlessly punishing slapstick and overall cruel tone left me cold. Obviously given the reaction of my fellow critics not to mention viewers at a recent screening ""Kung Fu Hustles"" delirious doggedly self-conscious humor is infectious. Whether it is enduring or deserves to be is another matter entirely. Chow opens his movie with a charming tracking shot that quickly turns into a witty homage to the ""Pink Panther"" films. From that bravura prologue ""Kung Fu Hustle"" goes to affectionately spoofing the international canon from gangster pictures and westerns to Busby Berkeley musicals and of course Chows beloved Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan flicks. The action in ""Kung Fu Hustle"" which is set in 1940s Shanghai revolves around a small-time crook named Sing (Chow) who desperately wants to join the legendary criminal syndicate the Axe Gang. Sing along with a corpulent sidekick played by Lam Tze Chung decides to prove himself in the citys toughest neighborhood Pig Sty Alley. But first hell have to do business with that communitys unofficial leader a ruthless landlady played by former James Bond starlet Qiu Yuen who has acquired 30 pounds a parabolic frown and a firmly lipped cigarette. Thats only the very busy beginning of a story in which every other character is a kung fu master schooled in ever more arcane fighting techniques. Chow has a great deal of fun at the expense of the chop-socky films hes been making for the past 20 years and the inside jokes and constant action in ""Kung Fu Hustle"" will appeal mostly to fans of that hugely popular genre. But movie geeks in general will appreciate Chows often amusing nods from Martin Scorseses ""Gangs of New York"" (which is mercilessly skewered here) to Ray Harryhausens stop-motion classic ""Jason and the Argonauts."" Its appropriate that Chow would nod toward the godfather of special effects since ""Kung Fu Hustle"" features nearly every special effect in the book. Indeed Chow takes so many visual liberties with his characters that ""Kung Fu Hustle"" resembles a ""Road Runner"" cartoon as often as it does a live-action film. But as over-the-top as the movie often is the director takes surprising care to create meticulous sets for his human Wile E. Coyotes. From the Axe Gangs dapper top hats to some lovely lyrical scenes involving a beautiful ice cream vendor Chow composes his scenes with an uncommon sense of detail color and crisp symmetry (and the 1940s-era signage is a particularly delightful touch). But primarily ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is about the martial arts sequences which have been expertly choreographed by Hong Kong veterans Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung but which if youre not already enamored of the genre will seem to go on and on. A three-way fight involving some unlikely kung fu masters is well executed as is a sublime sequence in which a man playing a Japanese harp hurls forth an army of murderous ghosts (that passage is foreshadowed by an amusing bit of business involving a kitten). But by the time ""Kung Fu Hustle"" reaches its grand climax youre either into it all the way or youre not quite sure why you should care about this unpleasant group of characters. As is made coarsely clear in Chows last scene -- which he injects with a gratuitously gross sight gag -- he needs to learn to leave bad enough alone. Kung Fu Hustle (95 minutes in Cantonese and Mandarin with subtitles at area theaters) is rated R for sequences of strong stylized action and violence.

Photo by Tang Chak Sun/courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics all rights reserved MOVIE REVIEWS / When the going gets rough the bodies start flying in Hustle 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Kung Fu Hustle Action comedy. Starring Stephen Chow Yuen Qiu and Chiu Chi Ling. Written and directed by Chow. (In Cantonese and Mandarin with English subtitles. R.99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Kung Fu Hustle"" is destined to be the next ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" -- a subtitled movie for people who dont do subtitles. Words are hardly necessary to enjoy this martial arts spoof set in a highly stylized prerevolutionary China made to look like a Hollywood back lot. The translation is even a distraction -- its as banal as the images are vivid. When a thug yells at his rival ""Hey Fatso eat s -- and die"" you get the sense Tolstoy is not being rendered here. The screen quickly becomes a graphic battlefield in which bodies are sent flying through the air during turf warfare. ""Hustle"" should come with a disclaimer warning people not to try this at home. The madcap fights are in the service of a seriously silly story -- a variation on a multitude of war movies illustrating what soldiers must endure to earn their stripes. The ""soldier"" in this case is Sing a wannabe gangster played by Stephen Chow who also is the director producer and co-writer. His stamp is all over the movie mostly to its benefit. As an actor Chow deftly morphs from a sad sack to a convincing action hero. Hes like Jerry Lewis with his comic antics enhanced by computer-generated effects. Related Stories Kung Fu Hustle spoofs martial arts Chow is a commendably visual filmmaker who had the brilliant idea of melding karate chops with slapstick. But ""Hustle"" fails to connect on any emotional level. Its a live-action comic book with characters so broadly conceived that its hard to care whether they live or die. As if to strip them of any traces of humanity most are given generic titles instead of names. Sing encounters Landlady (Yuen Qui) and Tailor (Chiu Chi Ling) while invading a slum known as Pig Sty Alley to extort money. Its a trial by fire for Sing whos anxious to prove he has the right stuff to join the much- feared Axe Gang. But as the young Don Corleone discovered elderly residents are not necessarily pushovers. The joke is on Sing when they prove to be kung fu masters who fight back. Her plump features framed in horrendous plastic hair curlers the shrewish Landlady a cigarette continually dangling from her mouth already has the tenants running for cover. Youd never know from her deliberately shrill and very funny performance that Yuen was a Bond girl in ""The Man With the Golden Gun."" Chiu who runs a martial arts school in Alameda pulls off a tricky transformation from the effeminate Tailor fussing over fabrics to a formidable opponent who uses a set of wide gold bracelets on each arm to clobber the Axe Gang. Chow obviously is besotted with American cinema and ""Kung Fu Hustle"" borrows from such wildly divergent sources as ""Pulp Fiction"" ""Gangs of New York"" ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Top Hat."" Gang members actually break into a little soft shoe dressed in top hats that would do Fred Astaire proud but leaning on axes instead of canes. A romantic interlude set in front of an Astaire and Rogers movie poster is quickly followed by a knife-wielding duel to the death. Like everything else in ""Kung Fu Hustle"" the transitions happen with breathtaking speed. -- Advisory This film contains violent scenes.

Hustles approach to a simple good-vs.-evil plot is eccentrically exuberant. Stephen Chow stars/directs/produces as a small-time thug who wants to be part of the big-time Axe Gang but instead ends up battling them. Sony Pictures Humor bordering on slapstick combined with thrilling choreography by Yuen Wo Ping who masterminded the fight scenes in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and The Matrix make Kung Fu Hustle a lively visual treat. There is plenty of violence but its largely cartoonish. A middle-aged female kung fu master wears curlers and housecoat. A tubby would-be gangster hurls knives at his foe but when those fail to pierce his opponent he resorts to flinging a cage of writhing snakes at him. Stephen Chow (a veteran of 60 movies including Shaolin Soccer) wrote directed produced and stars in this non-stop action movie which is in Cantonese with English subtitles. About the movie Kung Fu Hustle    (out of four) Stars Stephen Chow Leung Siu Lung  Yuen Wah Dong Zhi Hua Director Stephen Chow Distributor Sony Pictures Classics Rated R for strong stylized violence and action Expands Friday nationwide Chow plays Sing an eager lad who longs to be a member of the powerful and ruthless Axe Gang which terrorizes the land in pre-revolutionary China. When gang members appear on the scene sometimes dancing with their dreaded axes in hand the sky erupts with fireworks. The sets are vibrant with classic cars lining the neon-lighted streets and garish gambling casinos serving as the backdrop to the underworld activities. The martial-arts rumbles give off the sensation of Old West shootouts. One neighborhood is blessedly immune to the mayhem. Pig Sty Alley is so poverty-stricken it holds no interest for the Axe Gang. Then in wanders the hapless Sing who attempts to extort money from the poor denizens. But folks are not what they seem The town is full of kung fu masters. The swaggering Sing tries to single out someone he can fight but it seems as if everyone elderly and very young alike has a torso like Charles Atlas and can fend off foes in masterful ways. A succession of dazzling clashes ensues as Sing calls upon the Axe Gang which faces off against the denizens of Pig Sty Alley led by the towns landlords the powerful lady in curlers and her nebbishy husband. Fans of kung fu movies will have a rip-roaring time but even moviegoers who are not enamored of the genre are bound to enjoy the bizarre antics and spirited action of Kung Fu Hustle.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Kung-Fu Hustle | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; kung-fu-hustle ) Kung-Fu Hustle (China/Hong Kong 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Kung Fu Hustle is an action/comedy designed with lovers of the 60s and 70s Shaw Brothers movies in mind. Its an homage to a genre that despite being regarded as campy by about 95% of the movie-going populace has nevertheless captured the hearts and minds of thousands of loyalists. Stephen Chow Kung Fu Hustles director/writer/producer/star is one such person. His love of those old movies is evident in every frame this picture. Fans of ""traditional"" kung fu cinema will think they have died and gone to heaven. But what about the average viewer whose lone experience with martial arts may have been a flirtation with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or the Westernized The Matrix? One of the great strengths of Kung Fu Hustle is that you dont have to be a fan to enjoy it. Chows endeavor stands well enough on its own as a comedy and an action film. Sure a lot of the in-jokes will be missed but there are still plenty of laughs to be had and the action sequences have a kinetic energy that doesnt demand anything in the way of previous knowledge or experience. Kung Fu Hustle is infectious. The film transpires in 1930s Shanghai where the Axe Gang reigns supreme. The only parts of the city the Axes have ignored are the underprivileged sections - theres no profit in poverty. Thus when Sing (Chow) arrives in Pigsty Alley he can pretend to be a member of the Axe Gang without fear of running afoul of the real bad guys - or so he thinks. His impersonation doesnt work well since no one is intimidated by him. Then when some real Axe Gang members arrive he finds himself in an awkward position. We soon learn however that Pigsty Alley is home to more than one kung fu master living incognito. And when the Axe Gang brings violence to this little corner of Shanghai the residents are more than capable of fighting back. Like fellow Hong Kong star/filmmaker Jackie Chan Chow has a deft touch when it comes to mixing action and comedy. The balance while not perfect is strong enough to keep each aspect from overwhelming the other. The film includes several heart stopping battles and sequences when its virtually impossible not to laugh aloud. Because theres a strong element of parody in the way Kung Fu Hustle has been developed it has a cartoonish feel. But for this kind of film thats not really a drawback. (There are times however when CGI which is becoming the bane of many modern filmmakers is overused.) The lead actor is Chow whose box office drawing power in Asia is surpassed only by that of Jackie Chan. For Kung Fu Hustle Chow has assembled an eclectic group of supporting players one of whom deserves to be singled out. Yuen Wah who plays a kung fu master masquerading as a meek landlord worked at one time as Bruce Lees stunt double and was a respected action choreographer. His presence in this film represents one of many Valentines Chow offers to genre aficionados. Kung Fu Hustle is designed for an international audience so it should come as no surprise that there numerous references will leap off the screen to an average American movie-goer (including nods to The Shining The Untouchables Gangs of New York and The Matrix amongst others). Chows recent unpleasant experience with a major North American distributor has not soured him on the marketplace - only made him sign with a different distributor. (Chows Shaolin Soccer was mishandled and mismarketed by Miramax damning the giddy electric action/comedy to an almost non-existent theatrical run followed by an unpublicized DVD dump.) Kung Fu Hustle should get a chance in a respectable number of theaters and viewers will discover that the film has something to offer nearly everyone whether they are a novice or a black belt in kung fu cinema.

Long-awaited return by multi-hyphenate Stephen Chow after his socko Asian hit ""Shaolin Soccer"" tries for something new but unfortunately throws the comedians usual trademarks out with the bath water. Long-term legs look wobbly. Hong Kong comedy-fu meets ""The Matrix"" in ""Kung Fu Hustle"" a chop-socky on f/x steroids thats devoid of genuine inspiration or involving character development. Long-awaited return by multi-hyphenate Stephen Chow after his socko Asian hit ""Shaolin Soccer"" (2001) tries for something new but unfortunately throws the comedians usual trademarks out with the bath water. Initial numbers are likely to be hearty in Asia thanks to pics must-see factor but long-term legs look wobbly; in the West some auds may respond to the f/x feast but Sony/Columbia will need major marketing kung-fu to hustle up sizable theatrical action. Auds familiar with Chows distinctive comic style and the rhythms of his previous movies -- including a large number of Western fans and the whole of Asia -- will quickly feel shortchanged. From its Westernized tempo to its apparently deliberate avoidance of Chows trademark moleitau (nonsense) verbal humor and self-spoofing comic payoffs ""Hustle"" is a very different animal from his three previous outings as director-writer-star (""Soccer"" ""King of Comedy"" and ""God of Cookery""). Theres a debilitating emotional flatness at the heart of the picture as if Chow has tired of his usual shtick but isnt quite sure what he wants to put in its place. For producing partner Col Asia whose philosophy has always been to put local auds first ""Hustle"" reps a major gamble with Asian expectations. Set in a deliberately vague pre-Peoples Republic of China neverland -- presumably Canton (modern Guangzhou) in the early 30s or late 40s -- wafer-thin plot starts with the arrogant boss of the Crocodile Gang (helmer Feng Xiaogang cameoing) being hacked to pieces in the street by the tux-wearing Axe Gang led by Brother Sum (Chan Kwok-kwan) and his sidekick (Johnnie To vet Lam Suet). Disquieting seriousness of the violence is quickly dispelled by an inventive song-and-dance number intercut with a Bamp;W photo montage celebrating the Axe Gangs control of the city. The awaited comic payoff appears to come with a cut to a poor quarter of the city the appropriately named Pigsty Alley.A large U-shaped tenement building with an open courtyard becomes the center location for the main story. As the colorful characters are introduced in a consciously theatrical manner Chow seems to be recalling classic Chinese legit especially the much-filmed ""The House of 72 Tenants."" Enter Chow himself as Sing a wannabe hood with a dumpy sidekick (Lam Tze-chung) who unsuccessfully tries to extort money from the inhabitants. But though Sing is a typical Chow creation penniless yet with attitude to spare theres little self-mockery no double-take humor and an early reliance on visual effects and Road Runner-like cartoonery. First major set piece arrives 20 minutes in when Sums sidekick arrives with the real Axe Gang resulting in an impressively staged rumble. Rest of pic is a series of set pieces as Sing -- hired by the Axe Gang to bust an all-powerful Master nicknamed The Beast (Leung Siu-lung) out of a loony bin -- finally discovers that he too has the makings of a super-hero as Master of the Buddha Palm. Basic story arc and some of the visual effects parallel recent South Korean comedy-actioner ""Arahan"" also centered on a cocky ordinary Joe in a super-Master universe. On almost every level ""Arahan"" aces ""Hustle"" from its blend of comedy and action through character development to use of visual effects as an adornment rather than replacement to the human drama. A subplot featuring Sings long-lost childhood love street-seller Fong (Huang Shengyi) seems thrown in as an afterthought. Typically for Chows distaff leads -- Karen Moks grotesque in ""God of Cookery"" Zhao Weis ugly duckling in ""Soccer"" -- shes a social outcast in this case a mute. As for any emotional underpinning forget it. Tech package is slick at all levels. Action by Yuen Wo-ping (""The Matrix"") is OK though repetitive. Original action choreographer Sammo Hung quit after six weeks reportedly after disagreements with Chow.
