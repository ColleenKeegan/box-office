Francois Duhamel/Paramount Vantage hide caption toggle caption Francois Duhamel/Paramount Vantage Director Paul Thomas AndersonGenre DramaRunning Time 158 min Watch Clips I Will Bless the Well There Will Be Blood Trailer To music that sounds like a hive of angry bees Daniel Day-Lewis falls down an oil well hes digging and breaks his foot -- his left foot -- in the opening moments of Paul Thomas Andersons oil epic. Based on Upton Sinclairs 1927 novel Oil about a clash of capitalism and religion at the turn of the last century this sometimes magnificent decidedly strange film is a portrait of a terrible rapacious man. The American Dream or perhaps simple greed has turned him into a sociopath though there are moments when he seems briefly empathetic -- adopting the infant son of a fellow well-digger whos killed in an accident or opening up his life to a stranger who shows up claiming to be a brother he never knew he had. These flashes of humanity dont turn out well however and the characters as hard to like as he is hardbitten. A young preacher played obsessively by Paul (Little Miss Sunshine) Dano is no easier to warm up to. And few other performers make much impression. But the imagery -- an oil boom town is built before your eyes then nearly burns down in a Western landscape that seems a character in its own right -- is undeniably powerful. Anderson an indie director with a streak of intriguing art-film hits to his credit (Magnolia Boogie Nights Punch-Drunk Love) proves to have a real eye for epic filmmaking though with a screenplay that sometimes goes for half an hour without a word being spoken an extreme violent ending and a running time that stretches to 158 minutes that film ends up seeming a blunter instrument than it might.

When we meet him he is none-too-successfully prospecting for silver. Then he strikes oil in his mine and it strikes a fire in his mind. Yes there will be blood in the course of his life. But there will also be riches that reach beyond the dreams of avarice. And finally beyond the bounds of sanity too. With this film writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson aspires to the creation of an American epic -- a story in which Plainview attempts to fill the vast empty spaces of the 20th century American West and the equally vast empty spaces within himself by the relentless acquisition of -- well yes -- oil leases. His movie is full of echoing silences punctuated by acts of violence that are sometimes accidental sometime inevitable. It is also a work that is easy to understand too quickly and utterly depends for its haunting resonance on the great performance that stands at its center. That performance begins with a very curious voice. Plainview speaks with great syntactical precision in cultivated almost mid-Atlantic tones that belie his early wildcatting ways. He sounds a lot like John Huston the director-actor when he was doing his best to persuade us of his sincerity. And as with Huston we can never be entirely certain whether he is playing us true or false. When he is assembling the land for the oil field that will transform his fortune make him not merely rich but super-rich he speaks idealistically of a community perhaps a new sort of civilization he intends to build and we dont entirely disbelieve him. He passionately loves his son who as a mere child is always introduced to people as Plainviews ""partner."" There is within him I think an authentic belief in the Gospel of Wealth that old American doctrine holding that the rich man is but the steward of money obligated to spend it for the benefit of all. Two events sully Plainviews idealism. His perfect son is grievously injured in an oil field accident which slowly sunders their relationship and robs Daniel of the dynastic rationale for his depredations. Worse he falls into opposition with a young fundamentalist preacher Eli Sunday (the excellent Paul Dano) -- also an idealist of sorts but an irrational one. The preacher forces Daniel into a false public conversion to his faith which wipes out what remains of his faith in the perfectability of the people. From this point onward Daniel surrenders himself to pure greed to acquisition entirely for acquisitions sake and There Will be Blood ceases to be a historical drama. It is loosely based on a novel by Upton Sinclair who was himself an idealist whose dreams were dashed by the realities of American life; his novel was in turn loosely based on the curious career of Edwin Doheney the pioneering California oil man the film turns into a sort of modernist parable. What Anderson is saying is that we have travestied this nations incalculable natural wealth in the process surrendering its potential to finance a paradise on earth in favor of a purely selfish materialism feebly justified by desperate religious fantasies. Or to put that point in purely movie terms Daniel Plainview becomes Gordon Gekkos grandfather. And becomes purely insane. It is the genius (and I use that word advisedly) of Daniel Day-Lewiss performance to slowly patiently show the madness replacing his former rationalism to prepare us for the films astonishing ending an ending one dare not reveal but that contains what I -- resistant as I am to superlatives -- consider to be the most explosive and unforgettable 10 or 15 minutes of screen acting I have ever witnessed. Ive already heard people mumbling about There Will Be Bloods inordinate length (its over two and a half hours long) about the fact that for long stretches nothing much seems to be happening. They are wrong of course. Within these beautifully photographed (by Robert Elswit) landscapes we are witnessing the impact of events (some of them by no means dramatically uninteresting) on an overmatched mind one that dimly aspires to something more than mere acquisition but is slowly undone by a universe ineluctably prone to mischance misunderstanding and just plain mischief. It requires time for Day-Lewis and Anderson to realistically explore the life-long processes of disillusion which is their films true subject. But the promise their sometimes langorously paced film makes is openly stated in their title -- yes there will be blood. And when it comes it will more than reward whatever patience -- and impatience -- you have invested in this unique experience one of the most wholly original American movies ever made.

Daniel Day-Lewis star as There Will Be Blooda down-and-out silver miner raising a son on his own who transforms himself into a self-made oil tycoon. Photo Francois Duhamel AP There Will Be Blood 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Going to the movies is an act of love a leap of faith. Buying the ticket splurging for the popcorn lowering the body into a not-quite-ergonomic seat Its like a blind date. We invest all that time and money and irrational hope in a movie and we expect to fall in love with it. We ache to fall in love with it. And if it fails? Well hell hath no fury like a viewer scorned. So if I spit a few nails at Paul Thomas Anderson please understand that I spit as a jilted lover. For almost 21/2 hours I fell head over heels for There Will Be Blood. I thrilled at its magnificence - at Daniel Day-Lewis evocation of cold frontier amorality at Jonny Greenwoods outre and wildly discordant orchestral score at Robert Elswits stark elemental cinematography. As prospector Daniel Plainview whose quest for oil dominates a tiny settlement in turn-of-the-century California Day-Lewis delivers a performance of such chilling and omnivorous force that even his butcher-block mustache carries an air of menace. Hes less a violent man than the living threat of violence itself; when his wiry frame erupts in a sudden fit of vengeance you can almost hear it twang. The meat of the drama occurs between Plainview and his cultural opposite a charismatic preacherman called Eli Sunday - a name straight out of Flannery OConnor - and played with creepy baby-faced calculation by Paul Dano. You might or might not recall him as the silent brother from Little Miss Sunshine. You certainly wont forget him here. At first writer-director Andersons loose adaptation of an Upton Sinclair novel (Oil) unfolds with the inevitability of greatness. The look and pacing of each scene seems unearthed rather than designed found rather than made - like black gold itself. Filmed in Marfa this study of ambition on the dusty fringes of America invites comparison with the Treasure of Sierra Madre and other classic Western forays into the landscape of greed and for two hours and 20 minutes it ranks with the best films of the year. Then it collapses. Utterly. Unaccountably. It ends with a giant 20-minute huh? marked by out-of-the-blue soliloquies and erratic concessions to the passage of time. (One character fails to age at all.) My first thought after amp; was that Anderson had worked too hard to answer a scene of dark foreshadowing staged earlier in the film but perhaps he failed to work hard enough. Its all too obvious all too pat and it loses that weight of profound inevitability that looms over the rest of the film. Yet ever the jilted lover I remember the good times the opening sequence wordless and shattering; the images marked by the black slick of oil the red streak of blood and the brilliant shock of fire; the enigmatic pull of Day-Lewis performance; and all those alienated emotionally battering and sometimes beautiful scenes between Plainview and his young son H.W. (Marfas Dillon Freasier). In quiet moments I can still hear the drones slides and drilling tension of Greenwoods score - which includes chunks of his compositions for the BBC Orchestra but reflects as well the innovative spirit of his work with Radiohead. And as an incurable romantic I hold out hope that Andersons flawed but phenomenal feat here marks the start of a new mature stage in a long career that burst into relevance with Hard Eight and Boogie Nights. He has genius in him. So does the movie - before its ending. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Bass Pro Shops Clearance Sale Deals from 1 + free shipping w/...

Daniel adopted H.W. as a baby and deliberately uses the innocent-looking boy who is devoted to his dad as a way to soften potential business allies for the kill. When at age 10 H.W. loses his hearing following an oil-well explosion his usefulness is diminished and he is packed off by Daniel to an institution. This scene is the films emotional high point because as is typical of Anderson he makes it bracingly unsentimental. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Daniels professional adversary is Standard Oil with whom he wars in his ultimately successful attempt to build a pipeline to the sea. But it is Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) the son of the landowner he first conned who is his principal nemesis. Eli has become the local preacher a kind of junior league Elmer Gantry and he wants 10000 from Charlie to build a new church. Daniel detests religion and recognizes a fellow con man when he sees one.Imperially creepy Eli like Daniel can be viewed as a nightmare archetype of American hypocrisy. His false piety is matched by Daniels personal code. ""I dont want anyone else to succeed"" Daniel says at one point - thats his religion. In the films ghastly comic pinnacle Daniel undergoes a baptism viciously presided over by Eli in order to secure a business deal.This may all sound a bit formulaic but Anderson doesnt overdo the rigor. Structurally theres a formlessness almost an aimlessness to ""There Will Be Blood."" Eli drops out of the movie for a long stretch. A crucial sequence involving H.W. and arson is confusingly presented as is the unmasking of a man (Kevin J. OConnor) who claims to be Daniels half-brother. Everything that happens in the film is subordinated to Daniel who is front and center in practically every scene and whose feral mask with its big black moustache is the films emblem its skull and crossbones.Anderson deals in archetypes because he cant or doesnt care to get inside the skins of his people. He eliminates the psychological baggage that might ""explain"" Daniel but the result is a furious sameness Daniel doesnt deepen he darkens.If anybody but Day-Lewis were playing him the film for all the skill with which it has been made might have been tedious. (Robert Elswits cinematography Jack Fisks production design and the score by Radioheads Jonny Greenwood are all amazing.) But Day-Lewis who seems to have modeled his courtly-demonic vocal drawl here on John Hustons Noah Cross in ""Chinatown"" is one of the few actors who can infuse a symbolic character with the lifeblood of passionate lived-in experience.But what is he symbolizing exactly? ""There Will Be Blood"" sets itself up as nothing less than a movie about America and its false prophets and about the greed that defaces glory. But ultimately its an epic about a monster whose most affectionate gesture in the film is spiking his baby boys milk with gin.Anderson has made a small-minded big-minded movie; the disparity between the vastness of its scale and the obsessiveness of its dramatic focus is supremely odd.There are people who knowing nothing about ""There Will Be Blood"" but its title will mistake it for a horror film. Theyre not far wrong. Grade A- Rated R for some violence.

"There Will Be Blood Thicker than water | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsThere Will Be Blood Thicker than waterThere Will Be Blood  the astounding new film by Paul Thomas Anderson is Horatio Alger by way of Faust .By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 4 2008 There Will Be Blood (out of 4) Starring Daniel Day-Lewis Paul Dano Dillon Freasier and Kevin J. OConnor. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. 198 minutes. At the Varsity. PG There Will Be Blood the astounding new film by Paul Thomas Anderson is Horatio Alger by way of Faust.Its the American Dream as tragedy a devils bargain born not of failure or capricious deities but of a mans indecent rush toward an object of desire while neglecting a fundamental need.The object is money the need is love and the man is Daniel Plainview very loosely drawn from the life of legendary Texas oil tycoon Edward Doheny and from Upton Sinclairs 1927 novel Oil.Daniel Day-Lewis inhabits Plainview in a way few actors could hiding layers of meaning beneath a wide-brimmed hat a determined gaze and a drawl borrowed from the late John Huston.Plainview is a more refined version of Bill the Butcher the knife hurler Day-Lewis essayed in Gangs of New York but he is every bit as fearsome. Violence comes as readily to him as the oil that seems to spurt from the ground almost at his command. Unlike gang leader Bill however Plainview is more inclined to the solitary life. He uses the words of a sociopath (""I hate most people"") and he resembles a figure out of a Hemingway novel a man bereft of a womans touch.Or anyones touch. When we first meet Plainview in the year 1898 hes a wordless and solitary mystery figure caked in sweat dirt and gunpowder blasting silver and gold out of a deep desert pit hes dug entirely on his own. Robert Elswits austerely beautiful camera works marvellously in tandem with a discordant soundtrack by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood completing the almost horrific scene of a man so possessed by greed hes mindless even to the pain of a serious injury.Flip the calendar ahead 13 fateful years and Plainview has found both wealth and a voice. Hes now seeking sticky Texas crude rather than glittering ore and despite being a man of means - he dresses like a tweedy English gentleman exploring the New World - hes every bit as hungry for cash as before. He talks like a gentleman now too his tongue lubricated with the weasel words he needs to persuade the ignorant to sell him oil-rich real estate for paltry sums.Fate - not love - has brought Plainview a son whom he refers to as H.W. (Dillon Freasier an impressive newcomer). Plainview uses H.W. as a shill to trick gullible farmers into thinking hes a family man. He pretends to be a simple grail hunter seeking land to ply his hobby rather than a rapacious oilman looking to rip up the Earth.Plainview is assisted in this deception by an unlikely and untrustworthy ally a pious farmers son named Eli Sunday (Paul Dano Little Miss Sunshine) who has outsized ambitions of his own. Sunday aims to preach as the head of his own church and to achieve his dream hes willing to sell out his own family by giving Plainview the deed to the ""ocean of oil"" that lies beneath the goat ranch owned by his unwitting father.Thus begins a rivalry that will rage throughout There Will Be Blood which is set against a backdrop of the vanishing American frontier the mixed blessing of technology and most dramatically and violently the collision between religion and secular society.On that last point writer/director Anderson is well versed in grand biblical themes having used an Old Testament metaphor in the shower of frogs that enlivened his earlier film Magnolia. But Andersons real fascination traverses a more intimate stage and its easy to miss if you accept at face value Plainviews claim of hating the world. Plainviews avowed misanthropy is disingenuous the more he professes to want nothing to do with his fellow man the more he reveals how desperately he seeks the comfort of meaningful human connections.Plainview yearns for family life even as he commits callous acts that seem entirely in opposition to that goal. He readily embraces a dodgy drifter named Henry (Kevin J. OConnor) who arrives one day with family news and professing a sibling bond. Failure to live up to Plainviews family dreams brings explosive consequences. Witness the way he responds when his fatherly devotion is criticized after an oil derrick explosion leaves H.W. in diminished circumstances.This unvoiced need for familial affection makes There Will Be Blood resonate strongly in both the mind and the heart even as we flinch from Day-Lewiss award-worthy portrayal of Plainview. His performance is so unnerving it threatens to take down all others around him and indeed Dano seems outmatched in his presence - especially in the problematic final reel when Andersons own Faustian pact with risky cinema finally implodes.Numerous reviewers have already made the connection between There Will Be Blood and Citizen Kane another story of a great man undone by unresolved family issues. Its a valid comparison. But Charles Foster Kane had memories of his beloved sled Rosebud to cling to. Daniel Plainview a man whose past is filled with shadows and ghosts doesnt even have that small consolation. All he can do is watch as his oil geysers gush and his bank accounts fatten bringing him that most golden of curses all the money in the world but nothing of lasting value to buy with it.

Starring Daniel Day-Lewis Paul Dano and Dillon Freasier. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. (R. 158 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Anyone who cares about the art of movies will eventually have to see contend with and make a decision about ""There Will Be Blood"" and that in itself constitutes a kind of recommendation. Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson challenges audience expectations makes unexpected and bizarre choices - sometimes for the sake of making them - and almost brings off a picture worthy of his grandiose ambition. Ambition counts for something. Instead of doing miniatures Anderson is attempting work on an epic scale. Talent counts too. Theres pleasure in just watching Anderson work. Take the scene in which the self-described ""oilman"" Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) offers his services at a California town meeting. Anderson chooses to film most of the scene with a medium shot of Plainview. He resists cutting to Plainviews audience and so Plainview becomes the center of our universe. Everyone besides him becomes unimportant and vaguely surreal - a replication of the characters own psychological point of view. Though Andersons talent and ambition are striking theres also the matter of how that talent is used. By the finish Anderson stops celebrating and luxuriating in Plainviews audacity and starts wallowing in his own. As was the case in ""Magnolia"" with its raining frogs ""There Will Be Blood"" derails into grand gestures and deliberate perversity. The finish is not quite as bad as having Anderson pop out from behind the curtain to announce the previous two hours have been a joke. But its close enough to rob ""There Will Be Blood"" of any impact besides that which is focused on the director - a kind of ""wow could you believe he did that"" This is a shame because for most of the way the film is an effective and seemingly straightforward piece inflected by Andersons shrewd stylistic touches (like having Radioheads Jonny Greenwood compose the soundtrack) and by his visionary capacity for the big canvas. The first scenes are without dialogue and could be transposed into a silent film. Its 1898 and Plainview is mining for silver. Hes the great American entrepreneur the ambitious loner pushing farther west and pushing himself to his physical limits. Later hes drilling for oil and by the time we first hear him speak hes already a self-made success. The voice itself comes as a surprise the first of the films eccentric choices. Day-Lewis goes through the film imitating John Huston. Maybe its a reference to Hustons tycoon role in ""Chinatown"" or a secondhand acknowledgment of ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" a movie about gold prospectors that starred Hustons father Walter Huston. In any case the imitation creates a distancing effect even for those unfamiliar with John Hustons voice. Day-Lewis is unable to rope that speech around a coherent characterization and so the character remains more a concept than an identifiable personality. That this was surely Andersons intention doesnt make it a smart idea. ""There Will Be Blood"" is good at presenting the West as a land of mystery and dangerous power and the scenes in which oil explodes from the ground in magnificent and frightening release are not to be missed. Plainview a monster of confidence and fearlessness is just the man to harness these natural forces and in the early scenes Anderson takes to presenting him in an eerie tableau with his young son (Dillon Freasier) standing calm and mute at his side. The presence of the prince makes Plainview look all the more like a king and his relationship with the son forms one of the films most satisfying and complex threads. When towns are growing and wealth is being created power struggles are inevitable but Plainview has only one rival in his world - a sanctimonious preacher Eli Sunday played by Paul Dano. The uneasy interaction between God and secular commerce is the films most important recurring notion. Its where ""There Will Be Blood"" could have had something definite and compelling to say but instead its precisely there that we find the films Achilles heel. Anderson doesnt take the religious mind seriously enough to understand it leaving Dano to play a generalized character who is somewhere between a freak and a phony. The scenes between Day-Lewis and Dano ultimately degenerate into a ridiculous burlesque. Still individual scenes and sequences - for example the entire section in which Plainview gets to know his ""long lost"" brother - are too strange haunting and emotionally right for the film to be dismissed. There should be no attempt or temptation to dismiss it. At the same time there should be no need to pretend ""There Will Be Blood"" is a masterpiece just because Anderson sincerely tried to make it one. -- Advisory This film contains violence and strong language.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Like a figure out of a WPA mural the first glimpse of Daniel Plainview is iconic. A man works a pickax in a tight black space. He is barely distinguishable from the raw materials he muscles. For a brief moment the protagonist in the brooding beauty ""There Will Be Blood"" could be an everyman. But writer-director Paul Thomas Andersons tale is one of radical self-invention the stuff of American myth and history. Daniel Day-Lewis the most uncanny actor working in the art of self-invention plays Plainview. If he does not win the Academy Award for this protean portrayal it will be because hes won before. Or because his gift his discipline is so daunting it can be confounding. Plainview climbs to the mouth of the mine shaft. The wincing glare off the arid terrain is startling. And Robert Elswits camera captures the barren glory of era and place (Texas stands in for California). Initially he mines alone. It seems a foolhardy prospect as he hauls his tools up from the shaft. When a mechanical disaster leaves him lame he still makes it to the mining office to file his claim. That was 1894. By 1902 the silver miner has become an oilman. He travels through soon-to- boom towns telling folks that hes the man to bring the stuff of our pleasures and sorrows up from beneath their farms and homesteads. Son H.W. (Dillon Freasier) stands beside him during these sales pitches. Once an infant flailing his arms while his father and a few others drilled down into the earth he has become a keenly observant boy. He is the prop to Plainviews boasts about his ""family business."" He is also his fathers only true company. A half-brother will arrive and with him an opportunity to know Plainview a modicum better. Hell tell this newly discovered sibling ""I have a competition in me. I hate others to succeed."" Much bears this out. When a young whelp tells Plainview of the oil in a place called Little Boston Plainview and H.W. travel there. Plainview tells the Sunday family which owns a big spread there that hes come to teach H.W. about hunting quail. But the familys eldest son Eli isnt sold. Paul Dano plays boy preacher Eli Sunday. A lanky youth hes easy to underestimate. And Plainview gives him the what-for a number of times. Yet ""There Will Be Blood"" becomes a diabolically commanding film once the unholy alliance of oilman and preacher is forged. Sunday and Plainview are locked in a battle to claim not just riches or souls. Like commerce and religion they compete to shape the void to imprint meaning on the vast expanse that California was at the turn of the last century. ""That was one hell of a show"" Plainview tells Sunday having watched the pastor cast out a demon. He should know. Plainviews own come-to-Jesus moment provides jaw-dropping theater. Is his salvation the show of shows or a true example of being overwhelmed? After all by the time he kneels before the Church of the Third Revelation congregation Plainview has experienced a great deal of loss. The scene also proclaims that yes there is such a thing as a churchified version of the Faustian bargain. While writing his script -- based loosely on Upton Sinclairs 1927 novel ""Oil"" and more on the life of Edward Doheny -- Anderson obsessively watched John Hustons parable of greed ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" also based on a 1927 novel. Danos risky rendition of Eli reminds audiences that there is spiritual avarice too. ""There Will Be Blood"" lives up to the metaphorical promise of its title. Dark liquid pools beneath the derricks. The blood of the lamb flowing from Elis church. There also are plenty of accidental and purposeful demises. Time will tell if Daniel Plainview and Doheny (the Pan American Petroleum amp; Transport founder) can keep lasting company with the likes of other avatars of larger- than-life figures Charles Foster Kane and William Randolph Hearst; Noah Cross and William Mulholland of ""Chinatown."" But ""There Will Be Blood"" makes clear that Anderson has no fear of filing his own claim to greatness.

Directed and written by Paul Thomas Anderson. 158 minutes. Rated R for strong violence. Guild 45th Pacific Place. Movie review The question ""What profit a man to gain the world but lose his soul?"" gets harder to answer when theres no soul to begin with. A kind of ""Citizen Kane"" with no Rosebud ""There Will Be Blood"" chronicles an oilmans trajectory from miserable bastard to hateful maniac as he toils and cheats his way to success in the early 20th century. The singular experience deserves a big-screen viewing for Robert Elswits cinematography that recalls ""Days of Heaven"" and Daniel Day-Lewis performance that recalls John Huston circa ""Chinatown."" Based on the 1927 Upton Sinclair novel ""Oil"" the 2 1/2-hour epic is no crowd-pleasing popcorn-flick. But its stillness and loooong takes have such an immersive effect that you can practically smell the sweat in the shirts and taste the oil that covers everything. Accidentally striking oil while digging for silver solitary miner Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) becomes an oil prospector whose adopted little boy H.W. (Dillon Freasier) elicits his only humanity -- or mask of it -- while he convinces citizens to let him drill on their land. He doesnt like to answer questions or explain himself and doesnt have time for women. He confides that hes not exactly a people person ""I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. I hate most people."" One night a young man (Paul Dano ""Little Miss Sunshine"") turns up with an offer to tell Plainview the location of oil-rich land in exchange for money. When the unscrupulous Plainview tries to convince the owners to sell to him downplaying the vast wealth flowing beneath them he meets his nemesis for life charismatic young faith healer Eli Sunday (Dano again playing his own brother). The two men see right through each other and their rivalry escalates -- each getting the upper hand over the other eventually -- as the little California town grows around the oil. Tragedy accrues with the money and Plainview grows more remote more seething more stubborn paranoid and violent -- until any resemblance to a human being is accidental. Oscar-winner Day-Lewis approaches the ""Mommy Dearest"" tipping point with his Huston imitation -- particularly at the snarling drooling climax -- but its so fascinating that I wish hed do audio books in that persona. Prediction and blurb There will be nominations. (And soon because technically this is a 2007 movie). Up to now director Paul Thomas Andersons work has diminished with each film since ""Boogie Nights"" but ""Blood"" is a maturation and reinvention. If his star is channeling Huston then hes channeling Stanley Kubrick. Even Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwoods orchestral score echoes ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" in its beautifully unsettling wails. Minor complaint As Plainviews right-hand man Ciaran Hinds (who was so good in ""Munich"" and HBOs ""Rome"") is largely squandered with little to do -- even if it is Day-Lewis show. The story also kept me at arms length because if it is the tale of a man who gains the world and loses his soul hes never shown in any whole state that allows for attachment or empathy with the character. Theres no key to the guy just hard work and hate. But then most people dont really have a Rosebud. That is unless on my deathbed I mutter ""... G.I. Joe Mobile Support Vehicle...

(Francois Duhamel - Paramount Vantage) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 4 2008 Paul Thomas Anderson becomes Californias certified cinematic poet laureate with ""There Will Be Blood"" his masterful account of the states oil boom at the turn of the century. This StoryMovies Blood Tapping A Real GusherTrailer There Will Be Blood On the heels of Andersons previous films ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"" both of which chronicled the recent history and culture of Los Angeles and its environs Anderson has now joined the ranks of such definitive California writers as Nathanael West and Joan Didion in crafting his own personal and potent version of the states creation myth. If ""There Will Be Blood"" represents a reach back into time for a filmmaker whose canvas has always been contemporary it is also unquestionably an ambitious leap forward proving that Anderson is an artist of virtually unlimited range and confidence. Its sanguinary title notwithstanding Andersons visionary often startling take on the classic western actually features relatively little of the substance. Instead it is oil that trickles flows and gushes with viscous promiscuity throughout a sweeping epic of enterprise aspiration greed and hubris. But blood provides a constant subtext in this by turns classical and audacious portrait of Californias founding and by extension the forging of the American identity. What better backdrop than the harsh unforgiving edge of a country to explore the shadowy boundaries of its deepest anxieties and most febrile dreams? The man in whom those warring impulses dwell is a prospector named Daniel Plainview who as ""There Will Be Blood"" opens is mining for silver in 1898. Played by Daniel Day-Lewis who with ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Gangs of New York"" clearly has a gift for portraying American archetypes Plainview is a man of single-minded focus formidable physical fortitude and roiling ambition. Hes also a man of few words able to convey volumes in one meaningful glance. The first several minutes of ""There Will Be Blood"" transpire in almost complete silence broken only when Plainview spies a bit of ore and whispers ""There she is."" As inhabited by Day-Lewis who even breathes with ferocious authenticity Plainview swiftly becomes an uncommonly transfixing character all the more captivating for his near-total inscrutability. Like the title of the movie itself Plainviews name is not descriptive of the man whose view becomes increasingly occluded by almost pathological misanthropy and self-deception. But before he turns into a monster of power-mad loathing Plainview gives viewers one of cinemas great anti-heroes a man of crafty wit and wily street wisdom who at his best personifies American pluck ingenuity and gritty self-reliance. When Plainview discovers oil in one of his mines he swiftly turns to that profession transforming himself from a wordless loner to a slick salesman convincing newly minted Californians to lease their land to him. In this road show hes aided by his young adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier) who was orphaned as an infant when one of Plainviews men died in an accident. (Those sudden violent mishaps provide what few scenes of blood there are in ""There Will Be Blood"" and even then its virtually indistinguishable from the muck and the mire.) The relationship between Plainview and his son characterized by devotion as much as by utilitarian practicality and finally betrayal is just one of the fraught dynamics that propel the film. The story also pivots on Plainviews encounter with a young Pentecostal preacher named Eli Sunday (Paul Dano in a stunning turnaround from his role as a sullen teen in 2006s ""Little Miss Sunshine"") whose theatrical pietism may be the only force greater in its ambition than Plainviews adamantly secular avarice. Watching these two master manipulators as they one-up each other is just one of the pleasures of ""There Will Be Blood"" which despite its vivid period setting bursts with contemporary political relevance (its not for nothing that Anderson has named Plainviews son H.W.). When Plainview and Sunday engage in a brief and amusingly sloppy bout of fisticuffs its like watching the head of the Cato Institute go mano-a-mano with Jimmy Swaggart. Things get even muddier when a mysterious party appears on the scene claiming a long-lost connection with the socially isolated Plainview. But the twists and turns of the plot are probably the least interesting thing about ""There Will Be Blood"" which Anderson adapted very loosely from Upton Sinclairs muckraking novel ""Oil"" What makes this one of the best movies of the season is its supreme commitment to pure cinema both in the gorgeous cinematography of Robert Elswit and a stunning musical score by Radioheads Jonny Greenwood whose edgy strings give the film a menacing apocalyptic buzz. The production design is by Jack Fisk and ""There Will Be Blood"" often recalls Fisks work with Terrence Malick on the equally meditative yet operatic ""Days of Heaven."" From the unforgettable wordless opening sequences of ""There Will Be Blood"" to the movies spectacular set piece of an oil derrick catching fire turning a gusher of oil into a flaming column worthy of the Old Testament Andersons vision of the new American West bursts with the energy and vim that so fiercely drive the man of action at its center. (Movie mavens might recognize the spirit of John Huston hovering over the entire enterprise from Day-Lewiss seeming impression of the late actor and Eli Sundays resemblance to the religious hustler in Hustons ""Wise Blood"" to ""Chinatown"" in which Huston played one of the swindlers showmen and speculators who bullied California into being.) And when Plainview finally does speak its with the exhilarating vernacular flourishes of the era whether hes delivering a sermon to some small-town landowners about bread and family or hungrily scanning an oil-rich landscape and asking ""Can everything around here be got?"" That finally is the only question that drives Plainview who by the third act has become a far less compelling character his contradictions having calcified into grotesque artifacts of mendacity and greed. Arguments will surely ensue after the films bizarre final scene when the title finally comes to extravagant fruition. But for all its hyperbole that symbolic showdown makes its own insane kind of sense anticipating yet another California boom when fame would be harnessed to fortune in colonizing the American dream when the bread Plainview once so floridly promised would prove just a little less seductive than circuses. There Will Be Blood (158 minutes at Bethesda Row E Street Cinema and AMC Georgetown) is rated R for some violence. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Blood Tapping A Real Gusher Trailer There Will Be Blood",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010304142.html,200,therewillbeblood16,therewillbeblood,washingtonpost

As Daniel Plainview a once lowly prospector-turned-petro titan ensconced in his California manse he illustrates that process by supposing that he and another guy are drinking milkshakes but that Plainview is drinking his from an especially long straw. He could reach over to the other persons milkshake with that straw you see and start drinking from it too. ""I drink your milkshake"" he exclaims mad as a hatter. Really truly mad. Beginning on the cusp of the 20th century and spanning 30 years There Will Be Blood is a genuine epic about manifest destiny good old-fashioned American ambition the obsessive pursuit of money and the equally feverish pursuit of God. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson of Boogie Nights and Magnolia fame and adapted from the Upton Sinclair novel Oil There Will Be Blood is also a showcase a two-hour-and-38-minute spectacle of wild and dazzling acting. Day-Lewis begins this movie as a young man alone deep in a hole digging through mud and muck. Hardly a word is spoken for 20 minutes - its like some depiction of primal man scraping grunting foraging. (To the eerie screech and thrum of music from Radioheads Jonny Greenwood.) By the end of the film which has taken Day-Lewis Plainview from a little Western town where oil oozes from the ground to the throne of an oil empire the man can barely stop talking Hes a font of rage and invective bitterness and bile. In between as Anderson charts the evolution and then devolution of a man (and maybe all humankind?) Day-Lewis delivers a performance that is so wholly there so scarily inhabited that his face his voice his brilliant deceptive scheming manner will stay with you for days. That the actor doesnt lay waste to everything and everyone in his path is a testament to both Day-Lewis instincts and to Andersons sense of storytelling of grand panorama. Paul Dano who has the tricky (pay attention) role of twins Paul and Eli Sunday mainly plays a quaking charismatic preacher - a boy really consumed with prayerful fervor and the desire to rule over a church of his own making. Kevin J. OConnor shows up midway through as a man who claims relation to Plainview. The Irish actor Ciaran Hinds plays Plainviews right-hand man in his early prospecting days and the young wide-eyed Dillon Freasier is Plainviews son H.W. There are no female roles to speak of really and certainly no romance. Anderson has cited John Hustons The Treasure of the Sierra Madre as a huge influence on this project. And in its story arc of humble beginnings runaway ambition and last-act implosion Citizen Kane certainly comes to mind. If There Will Be Blood doesnt quite match the achievement of these hallowed titles of American film it is for a weak link here or there and for a tendency toward over-the-top emoting. Like Julianne Moore going nuts in her drugstore breakdown in Magnolia Day-Lewis doesnt quite know when to stop - and Anderson doesnt know how to or want to tamp things down. That said There Will Be Blood is riveting and rollicking - a delirious exploration of human folly of zealotry for fossil fuels and zealotry in the name of a god. (Oil and fundamentalism sound familiar?) Day-Lewis channeling John Huston and Orson Welles (the grumbling intonations the crazy-eyed glares) and who-knows-who-else is nothing short of astounding. And There Will Be Blood is just a few barrels short of being a masterpiece. There Will Be Blood 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. With Daniel Day-Lewis Paul Dano Ciaran Hinds Kevin J. OConnor and Dillon Freasier. Distributed by Paramount Vantage. Running time 2 hours 38 mins.

That doesnt mean its easy to watch. Director Paul Thomas Anderson has fashioned a brilliant examination of the competing forces of capitalism and religion in the early 20th century - their differences and often their similarities at least when it came to winning converts. Yet the view is unyieldingly pessimistic. Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) is a few steps beyond misanthropic. At one point in an unusual bit of self-awareness he acknowledges that he hates most people. He wants to make enough money to get away from everyone. He has a competition in him he says - he cant stand to see others succeed. Few who compete against him do. There Will Be Blood opens with an astounding sequence in which we learn just how determined Plainview is to earn his fortune. Anderson takes us inside a small suffocating hole in the ground Plainviews silver mine. Plainview finds what hes looking for but an accident injures his leg. Undaunted he slides on his back pushing himself along with his good leg as the camera pans out over miles of deserted scrubby Western terrain - his journey laid out before him (and us). He will not be dissuaded. Time moves forward a few years with Anderson putting us at one of Plainviews oil wells. As Plainview and his workers seek oil they toil without distraction; the film contains no dialogue for more than 10 minutes. Oil is all the lifeblood not only of Plainview but also of the growing country and Plainview means to grab as much of it as he can. He enlists the help of his adopted son H.W. (newcomer Dillon Freasier) in snatching available land out from under the feet of unsuspecting owners. A cute face never hurts when youre trying to swindle someone. Plainview is visited by Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) who tells him of the oil bubbling up beneath the ground on his familys California land. It doesnt take Plainview and H.W. long to get there and soon they have the lynchpin in Plainviews march to the sea with only one more landowner holding out. Plainview sets up shop in the community called Little Boston building oil rigs and offering the promise of development to the eager residents. But when Plainview deals with the Sunday family he also deals with Pauls brother Eli (also played by Dano) a young preacher starting a church in the hardscrabble land. Hes onto Plainview and Plainview is onto him - they are competing for people for souls and strong backs. It will be a lifelong struggle between them. Dano who played the brother who refused to speak in Little Miss Sunshine speaks plenty here his voice a whiny cracking instrument that would seem no match for Day-Lewis commanding baritone. Yet Eli is as relentless in his quest to build his church as Plainview is to build his fortune; when Eli is converting someone he becomes almost like a howling animal. Plainview isnt so demonstrative but hes equally determined. It says something about the quality of Danos performance that he holds his own with Day-Lewis because Day-Lewis performance is as brilliant as any youll see. It seems something beyond acting in fact. Day-Lewis is famous for immersing himself in his roles. There is no hint of the actor here nothing given away in his eyes in his voice anywhere. We are invested in Plainview from the start as a man not just a character. This performance is the embodiment of the cliche that has adorned movie posters for generations but truly Day-Lewis is Plainview. Anderson meanwhile has made good movies before (Boogie Nights Magnolia) but this is beyond good. If There Will Be Blood is ultimately bleak its also a monumental achievement a movie and performance as great as they are unforgettable.

Video courtesy of Palisades Tartan. By Joe Morgenstern Updated March 1 2012 600 p.m. ET Tehrans propagandists did their idiotic best last week to tarnish the luster of the Oscar awarded to Irans ""A Separation"" Asghar Farhadis portrait of contemporary life in Iran. As soon as this masterly--and nonpolitical--motion picture won top honors for best foreign film the nations state-run television proclaimed a victory over Israel since in the words of the broadcast the award succeeded in ""leaving behind"" an unnamed rival from the ""Zionist regime."" (The nominated Israeli film in question Joseph Cedars ""Footnote"" is excellent in its own right and opens here next week.) Repressive regimes cant fathom expressive art even when as in Mr. Farhadis case whats being expressed enriches ones understanding of another culture. More than that repressive regimes cant tolerate artists who raise questions about how life must be lived under their rule. ""A Separation"" is an aberration a flawless piece of cinema that somehow slipped past the censors unscathed. This is not the way the Islamic Republic of Iran usually treats its filmmakers and a timely corrective is now at hand in the form of a 75-minute film provocatively titled ""This Is Not a Film"" that depicts the dismaying plight of the writer-director Jafar Panahi. To savor the full meaning of the title--including its reference to the Magritte painting of a pipe called ""This Is Not a Pipe""--you need a sense of what Mr. Panahi one of Irans most distinguished filmmakers has had to endure for the past several years. First detained in 2009 he spent three months in prison where he was mistreated and went on a hunger strike. After his release on 200000 bail he received a six-year prison term and was prohibited for 20 years from making or writing movies giving interviews or leaving the country. While his case was on appeal and he was under house arrest in his Tehran apartment Mr. Panahi and a documentarian friend shot ""This Is Not a Film"" using a professional video camera and an iPhone. Transferred to a USB drive and smuggled inside a cake into France the film--or not-film--was shown as a last-minute submission at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. (For current and coming screenings go to www.thisisnotafilm.net) ENLARGE Jafar Panahi in This Is Not a Film. Kanibal Films/Everett Collection Since theres no plot (apart from the governments efforts to silence one of its most gifted and humane critics) and no action (aside from some slitherings by Igi the Panahi familys pet iguana) a nonfilm argument can be made. Magrittes pipe after all wasnt a pipe but a painting. At the same time though it was the essence of a pipe and this digital whatever-you-call-it is the essence of a film replete as it is with wry humor information ambiguity suspense and deep feeling. The nonstar Mr. Panahi is first seen eating breakfast then discussing his case with a lawyer on the phone. (At present he is still in legal and professional limbo.) Soon he talks about a film he wasnt allowed to make--doesnt just talk about it but describes it in detail and as if channeling the stage manager in ""Our Town"" delineates the heroines bedroom with yellow packaging tape stuck on a huge Persian carpet. That effort ends abruptly however when the director realizes its futility and succumbs albeit briefly to melancholy. ""If we could tell a film then why make a film?"" he says mostly to himself and goes off-camera to recover his composure. On a brighter note Mr. Panahi talks about how actors--especially nonprofessional actors--can steer a film in unexpected directions; he makes the point with clips from his own features. Then the point makes itself with the unexpected arrival at the apartment door of a young man playing himself. Hes a substitute janitor come to pick up the trash. Yet thats only one part of the self he reveals under the directors gentle but insistent questioning. He also turns out to be a graduate student in arts research. The presence of this not-actor provides the not-film with a surreally funny shaggy-dog sequence in an elevator followed by a finale with fireworks thats entirely accidental and truly grand. Against all odds an unquenchable artist has made yet another piece of powerful art. Let the Bullets Fly ENLARGE Chow Yun-Fat Jiang Wen and Ge You in Let the Bullets Fly. Well Go/Everett Collection The first and second things to be said about Jiang Wens action adventure set in China during the warlord era of the 1920s are that it is marvelously funny--a screwball comedy with more layers than a pearl--and visually sumptuous. (The distinguished cinematographer Zhao Fei has shot three films for Woody Allen in the U.S.) It should also be said that Mr. Jiang who directed con brio and who plays a starring role is himself no stranger to state censorship. After taking his phenomenally accomplished second feature to Cannes without official permission--its called ""Devils on the Doorstep"" and it won the 2000 Grand Jury Prize--he was prohibited from making films for seven years. All the more marvelous then that ""Let the Bullets Fly"" has become the top-grossing Chinese feature in the history of that nations movie business. Chow Yun-Fat stars in Wen Jiangs new action-comedy ""Let the Bullets Fly"" set in 1920s China. Video courtesy of Well Go USA and Variance Films. Marvelous but not mysterious. The film has it all--pounding pace sizzling banter (or so the banter seemed to me as I tried to keep up with the good colloquial subtitles) zestful physicality and a light joyous spirit. The story finds a notorious bandit Pocky Zhang superior in every way to a con man who has bought himself a governorship in a picturesque backwater called Goose Town. Mr. Jiang a formidable actor with a bulletproof deadpan plays the bandit who in fact has a clear complexion though a thug who impersonates him defaces himself with fake pockmarks. Impersonations constitute a great part of the fun. It gets difficult though seldom impossible to tell whos who as the plot thickens and folds back on itself. The narratives main thrust is a contest of wits--plus guns and swords--that rages between Pocky and a local mob boss Master Huang (played with arch suavity by the great Hong Kong action star Chow Yun-Fat) while the con man Tang (Ge You) works both sides of a street that bears a strong resemblance to the classic dirt thoroughfare in American Westerns.) The prize is drug money--Huang is tied into the opium trade--but Goose Towns poverty prompts Pocky to emulate Robin Hood an impulse that stands in sharp contrast to everyone elses cheerful corruption. ""Let the Bullets Fly"" has a clearly defined moral dimension but Mr. Jiang an absurdist at heart never lets it interfere with the fun. Being Flynn ENLARGE Robert De Niro in Being Flynn. Focus Features A peculiar line of dialogue may help explain my peculiar experience with this film. ""All my life"" says Nick Flynn a tormented young man played by Paul Dano ""my father has been manifest as an absence."" Nick has good reason to be tormented. His father Jonathan Flynn (Robert De Niro) is an angrily delusional con man who having abandoned his wife and child decades ago suddenly shows up to blight Nicks adult life. ""Being Flynn"" was directed and adapted--from the real-life Nick Flynns memoir--by Paul Weitz who had codirected with his brother Chris the unexpectedly affecting ""About a Boy."" I wanted to be affected by this new one and so I was while I watched it. A few hours later though the movies emotional content was manifest as an absence. What stayed with me most memorably was the fathers insufferable bombast and the sons sad passivity. Robert De Niro and Paul Dano star in Paul Weitzs new movie ""Being Flynn"" a story about a son re-connecting with his con-man father. Video courtesy of Focus Features. Thats sad too the whole production being less than the sum of its parts because some of those parts are skillfully crafted. Theres an air of authenticity to the homeless shelter at the intersection of both lives--its where Nick works and where Jonathan takes refuge when his luck on the street runs out. The premise is promising Will Nicks destiny be determined by biology? (You can bet that it wont.) The language is interesting for a while Jonathan who believes hes a great writer spouts great gobs of vivid verbiage. But his rants grow repetitive--Mr. De Niro delivers them with numbing ferocity and negligible nuance--and the old mans fate borders on unbelievable. Im not sorry I bought into the drama as I did. I just wish my willingness to believe hadnt been thwarted. Offside (2006) I took note of Jafar Panahis charming comedy last year in connection with ""A Separation"" but nows the time to note it again. The film dramatizes the plight of Iranian women through those who happen to be soccer fans and are excluded from the nations stadiums even though they may be equal to Iranian men in their passion for the sport. The heroines are a group of young Tehrani women whove been busted for trying to crash a World Cup qualifying match against Bahrain. The subtexts are the stupidity of authority and the hypocrisy of discrimination. Devils on the Doorstep (2000) Jiang Wens work of tragicomic genius addresses Japans barbarous occupation of China during World War II and is the essence of absurd until its suddenly not. The director plays a bluff peasant Ma Dasan who finds himself responsible for the lives of two Japanese prisoners--a madly zealous soldier and his devious interpreter. The comedy feeds gleefully on itself but be forewarned that the film elegantly shot in black and white ends with one of the most shocking--and brilliantly realized--sequences in all of contemporary cinema. The cinematographer was Gu Chang-Wei. There Will Be Blood (2007) Paul Dano has two roles in Paul Thomas Andersons epic account of the rise of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis at his peerless best) a scruffy silver prospector who parlays a few ill-gotten oil leases into a California empire. Mr. Dano thrust into the film as an almost-last-minute replacement for another actor plays Plainviews adversary a charismatic evangelist named Eli Sunday plus a much smaller role for which hed been originally hired. The director adapted the script freely from the 1927 novel ""Oil"" by Upton Sinclair. The cinematographer was Robert Elswit. Jonny Greenwood did the extraordinary score. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Sinewy grimy grizzle-bearded Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is as yet unnamed when we meet him chipping away at the earth in a fathomless mining hole out in the unclaimed American West. Solitary and stubborn Daniel is prospecting for silver. And in a paradigm of American enterprise at its most legendary he hammers his way toward fortune undaunted even by broken bones. A title slide in grim-lipped olden Germanic letterforms tells us its 1898. But the soundscape that envelops this singular miner as he hack-hack-hacks is in the revolutionary musical score by Radioheads Jonny Greenwood (as much the star of the show as Day-Lewis himself) like nothing we have ever heard before. What we see is a man in a turn-of-the-20th-century wardrobe who literally pulls himself out of the earths bowels to grab hold of wealth and power. By 1911 his fiercely competitive work ethic has paid off in the scramble to claim ownership of other natural resources The first words Daniel Plainview utters in exquisitely enunciated stentorian tones brilliantly constructed by Day-Lewis from the cadences of John Huston are ""Ladies and gentlemen I am an oilman."" By then the oilman is a tycoon with a fondness for an empire-builders mustache and although no woman is ever seen in his life hes accompanied on his landgrabs by the sweet-faced sharply observant boy he calls his son and business partner H.W. (Dillon Freasier an arresting nonpro natural). What we hear though is the keen whine rattle and tonal blur of musical modernity as the components of epic storytelling are lofted decisively into the 21st century. The aural juxtaposition sweetened by additional music from Johannes Brahms and the 20th-century Estonian ""mystical minimalist"" composer Arvo Part is more than thrilling -- its neurologically revolutionary as if were seeing with our ears and hearing with our eyes in a whole new way. Its also an omen that the oilman will become a madman. Our eyes of course are riveted on Day-Lewis who justifies the obsessiveness of his legendary work-prep style -- erasing all vestiges of DD-L-hood and living as the man he plays even when the cameras not rolling -- with a magnificent performance. Indeed it can hardly be called an ""act"" so fully does the fictional Daniel come alive with all the fury hatred restlessness and distrust that courses through him. And when not searching Day-Lewis frightening eyes (one a squint the other a glint) or bracing ourselves unconsciously against the aggressive threat of Plainviews forward-thrusting stance were spooked by the shifty menacing Holy Roller softness mustered by Little Miss Sunshines Paul Dano as the evangelical preacher Eli Sunday who comes to bedevil Daniels schemes for years. Anderson -- who boldly goes where no other moviemaker working today has gone before in this his fifth movie (after marvels including Boogie Nights and Punch-Drunk Love) -- stakes There Will Be Blood at least provisionally to a chunk of Oil Upton Sinclairs 1927 novel about the early greedy days of the American liquid-gold industry written 20 years after The Jungle. Dont look for much of the muckraking spirit of the original text though in Andersons adaptation which is shaped entirely to the filmmakers own obsessions. The movie catalogs the worst about capitalism about fathers and sons about exploitation broken trust and the corruption of power and then saves an extra dollop of acid for the misuse of piety. Anyhow a fierce story meshing big exterior-oriented themes of American character with an interior-oriented portrait of an impenetrable man (two men really including the false prophet Sunday) is only half Andersons quest and his exciting achievement. The other half lies in the innovation applied to the telling itself. For a huge picture There Will Be Blood is exquisitely intimate almost a collection of sketches. For a long slow movie it speeds. For a story set in the fabled bad-old-days past its got the terrors of modernity in its DNA. Leaps of romantic chordal grandeur from Brahms Violin Concerto in D Major announce the launch of a fortune-changing oil well down the road from Eli Sundays church -- and then much later announce a kind of end of the world. For bleakness the movie cant be beat -- nor for brilliance. A Want more?

"There Will Be Blood | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; there-will-be-blood ) There Will Be Blood (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli The best things about Paul Thomas Andersons There Will Be Blood are not elements that will build large audiences. This is a film about character development/disintegration and a comprehensive look at the early days of the oil industry. The more the film focuses on the mechanics of finding oil the process of getting it out of the ground and the politics of persuading landowners to sell the rights to their property There Will Be Blood has the capacity to engage if not enthrall. Unfortunately the films final third is poorly focused and while there is a clear conclusion it feels strangely hollow. There Will Be Blood is loosely based on Upton Sinclairs 1927 novel Oil Instead of developing a faithful recreation however Anderson has elected to focus on the early portions of the book and change the main character from the son to the father. This results in a more tightly concentrated story although it fragments to a degree during the movies third act. Anderson takes a lot of liberties with the source material but those who have read the sprawling novel will recognize it as the inspiration. There are also echoes of the 1956 James Dean classic Giant. When we first meet Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) in 1898 hes mining for gold in a shaft he has dug into the ground of his Texas property. He finds what hes looking for and perhaps more. Several years later he has shifted his focus from gold to oil and he has been able to hire some hands. When an accident results in a death Daniel finds himself with an infant orphan to care for. He raises the child known as H.W. to be his own. By 1912 Daniel has become a well-known oil man and he his looking to expand his empire. Accompanied by his partner Fletcher (CiarA!n Hinds) and his son (Dillon Freasier) he travels to California to follow a promising lead. What he finds there astonishes him. He seeks to buy large parcels of property but he is impeded in his goal by the evangelist preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) who wants Daniel to donate 10000 to the local church before he sells. After the contract is signed however Daniel reneges on the deal. Shortly thereafter once the first drill has become operational there is an accident that results in an explosion that fuels a major oil fire and costs H.W. his hearing. For most of the film Daniel is a fascinating character. Hes a mass of contradictions charismatic ugly easygoing ruthless silver-tongued plain-spoken gentle violent. Hes smart and understands how to manipulate every situation to his advantage. He understands the business of oil and transforms himself from a poor miner into a wealthy businessman who can stand up to the mighty Standard Oil. Unfortunately the more power Daniel amasses the more corrupt and dissolute he becomes. He sends his injured son away. He murders a man. Attempts to save himself by turning to religion fail. There are even indications he may have had a relationship with a young girl. Anderson chronicles Daniels personality decay intelligently. He establishes the character as an admirable individual then slowly erodes him. In this way it makes it more difficult for the audience to automatically turn against him. By the third act however Daniel has become a caricature of evil. Hes psychotic and not the least bit interesting. During this phase Daniel Day-Lewis plays him much as he played Bill the Butcher in Martin Scorseses Gangs of New York. Day-Lewis performance is There Will Be Bloods biggest selling point. Its intense and volcanic and at least for two-thirds of the lengthy picture (which runs more than 2 1/2 hours) a brilliant depiction of Daniels complex and conflicted personality. When he agrees to be baptized one can see his two sides warring the one facet thats doing this purely to appease others so he can finalize a business deal and the other half that is desperate for some sort of redemption and solace. Despite having a son and (later) a brother Daniel is ultimately alone for much of the movie. In many ways hes a tragic figure. The massive amount of wealth he accumulates does nothing to salve his ulcerated conscience. For those who have followed Andersons career this is in some ways a departure. Its his first distant period piece and is more traditional than either of his best known pictures Boogie Nights and Magnolia. Although There Will Be Blood has a storyline that crosses more than 30 years and offers insights into the early era of the oil business in California it is first and foremost a character study. Anderson is primarily interested in how developing events shape Daniels life view. The films final 30 minutes may fail short of delivering on the promise of the preceding two hours but even taking into account its faults this is nevertheless an arresting fascinating and sometimes disturbing motion picture experience.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 24 2007 809 AM There Will Be Blood Paul Thomas Andersons deranged masterpiece. By Dana Stevens Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood With his fifth film There Will Be Blood (Paramount Vantage) Paul Thomas Anderson goes from the brainy poet of new American cinema to its deranged visionary. Even those of us whove always admired Andersons work (for me Boogie Nights was one of the best films of the 90s) never suspected he had anything like this in him. This two-and-a-half-hour saga of frontier capitalism resembles the parched Western landscape in which it takes place a vast craggy forbidding expanse rife with potential danger. It was shot in Marfa Texas the location of George Stevens 1956 oil epic Giant. Elsewhere Anderson has cited The Treasure of the Sierra Madre as his favorite film and no portrait of an isolated half-mad American tycoon can escape the shadow of Citizen Kane. But influences be damned There Will Be Blood looks and especially sounds like no movie youve seen before. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. For the first 15 or 20 dialogue-free minutes the only sound is the bizarre discordant score by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead a steady crescendo of synthesized strings that sounds like an orchestra tuning up in hell. The year is 1898. We watch as Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) survives a gruesome silver mining accident. He has better luck drilling for oil but his mining partner dies in another accident. (These early scenes brutally establish the constant peril of mine work.) Plainview adopts the mans infant son passing him off as his own. Thirteen years later Plainview has become a well-to-do speculator buying up tracts of farmland in exchange for the right to drill. Advertisement The main intrigue begins when a soft-spoken farm boy Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) walks into Plainviews office and alerts him to the presence of oil on his familys otherwise worthless land. Plainview snaps up the property for a song and begins building a derrick there. Paul Sunday mysteriously disappears but his twin brother Eli (also played by Dano) soon becomes Plainviews nemesis. Eli is an evangelical preacher with big plans for his makeshift congregation the Church of the Third Revelation. But Plainviews promise of a large donation to the church never materializes and when he ignores Elis request to bless the well at its opening ceremony the two men enter into a fierce power struggle that will eventually make good on the movies ominous title. Its best not to know too much about where this story will take you next How will Plainviews taciturn young son H.W. (Dillon Freasier) react to his fathers increasing obsession with power and wealth? Whats the real story of the stranger (a superb Kevin J. OConnor) who shows up claiming to be Plainviews half-brother? There Will Be Blood demands a lot of the viewer patience close attention to the often-sparse dialogue and an ability to tolerate unresolved ambiguities. But in return it gives you a whole world one thats idiosyncratic yet utterly convincing. Andersons camera--wielded by cinematographer Robert Elswit on sets designed by Jack Fisk--moves through the terrain with a preternatural confidence. The spare gorgeous images can evoke early photographs of frontier America but they arent nostalgic or precious; Andersons project turns out to be a resolutely modern one. The decades-long rivalry between Plainview and Eli Sunday could be read as a battle between capital and spirit--except that Eli the silver-tongued healer is not all that different from the Plainview the ruthless capitalist. Besides the two mens escalating spiral of one-upmanship is too funny and too rooted in character detail to be reduced to mere allegory. The story is anchored by two mirror-image scenes of humiliation--Plainviews takes place in the church Elis in a bowling alley--that are simultaneously harrowing and hilarious. But the bowling-alley showdown which is also the last scene of the movie feels like the directors one misstep. Its so broad so shamelessly over-the-top that the movie shifts from stark Oedipal drama to something like Grand Guignol. On a second viewing the ending still bothered me but a friend made a passionate case for it over drinks afterward. If nothing else its a choice that will inspire great conversations. Daniel Day-Lewis is beyond praise as the misanthropic egomaniacal desperately lonely oilman. He inhabits this enigmatic character loosely adapted by Anderson from Upton Sinclairs 1926 novel Oil with as much authority as if hed written the script himself. And Paul Dano familiar as the Nietzsche-reading adolescent in Little Miss Sunshine establishes himself as a major new actor. Playing the slippery Eli Sunday he shifts from piety to hypocrisy to menace while rarely raising his voice above a whisper. Especially as awards season approaches There Will Be Blood is sure tobe compared with No Country for Old Men another epic study of male rivalry and violence that was filmed near Marfa Texas. But to me There Will Be Blood is the greater film by far. It offers a persuasive critique of the nihilism that the Coen brothers film simply (if effectively) re-enacts. For a story thats all about the harnessing of fateful chthonic forces Paul Thomas Anderson has dug deeper than ever before and struck black gold.

No contest. Theres Daniel Day-Lewis awe-inspiring turn as a greedy oilman in ""There Will Be Blood"" and there is everyone else. Between D-Day the sheer ambition of Paul Thomas Andersons historical epic and Robert Elswits dazzling cinematography this is a must-see movie - even though its emotional temperature rarely rises above freezing and the climax goes way way way over the top. In Andersons loose adaptation of an obscure novel by Upton Sinclair Day-Lewis plays Daniel Plainview a lanky Minnesotan who is first seen risking his life to extract a few cents worth of silver from a mineshaft in 1898. As the films bravura 20-minute dialogue-free prologue continues we see Daniel a few years later when an accident at his first oil well kills a worker orphaning a baby boy whom Daniel takes as his own. The main action takes place in 1911 when a silver-tongued Daniel is trying to swindle farmers out of their oil-rich land portraying himself as the paternal owner of a ""family business"" that includes the now pre-teen son H.W. (Dillion Freasier). Among Daniels marks is a poor devout family in New Boston Calif. who have been betrayed by their son Paul Sunday (Paul Dano who more than holds his own with Day-Lewis) for a couple of hundred bucks. This puts Daniel on a collision course with Pauls twin brother Eli (also played by Dano the mute teenager in ""Little Miss Sunshine""). Baby-faced Eli is a self-styled preacher who successfully demands that Daniel build him a church. Daniel is ruthless and oblivious to the suffering around him - fatal accidents are common in the oil fields. But Eli is persistent particularly when Daniel goes out of his way to humiliate the preacher and Eli (in a truly hilarious scene that stands out in a grim movie) pays him back in kind. Even in a season filled with fantastic-looking films like ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" and ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" Elswits pho- tography of the wide open spaces stands out. A spectacular derrick fire that robs H.W. of his hearing - and drives a wedge between him and Daniel - is truly a thing to behold. There is a fascinating and disturbing interlude when the deeply lonely Daniel - who holds his top lieutenant (Ciaran Hinds) at arms length - is approached by a man (Kevin J. OConnor) who claims to be his stepbrother. ""I hate most people"" Daniel tells him in a rare moment of self-revelation. I loved Andersons out-there ""Magnolia"" and admired ""Boogie Nights"" but he goes in an entirely new and more mature direction with this film which reaches for comparisons with ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Giant"" and often achieves them. But Anderson overreaches in the movies lengthy epilogue set in 1927 which seems loosely inspired by ""Chinatown."" Daniels greed has pushed him off the deep end hes retreated indoors to a largely empty Hollywood mansion where he has showdowns with the adult H.W. and with Eli. Youd be tempted to write off most movies because of this climax not to mention the daunting length. Dont. What comes before is such a stunning piece of filmmaking that ""There Will Be Blood"" is still one of the years best movies. lou.lumenicknypost.com THERE WILL BE BLOODWorth the challenge.Running time 158 minutes.

A misanthropic oilman battles a narcissistic preacher for oil and souls in early 20th-century California. With Daniel Day-Lewis Paul Dano. Director Paul Thomas Anderson. (238) R Violence. At Lincoln Square 13. It looks like a period epic on the scale of ""Giant"" or ""The Grapes of Wrath"" but the larger-than-life subject of Paul Thomas Andersons ""There Will Be Blood"" is one person - a loathsome greedy violent oilman played with mesmerizing brilliance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Inspired by Upton Sinclairs novel ""Oil"" Andersons fifth feature follows its nasty antihero Daniel Plainview from his first mining discovery in 1898 Southern California to his Charles Foster Kane-like isolation in an empty mansion in 1927 the year Sinclairs novel was published. Affecting the near spot-on vocal cadence of the late John Huston Day-Lewis gives his most compelling performance since his Oscar-winning turn in 1989s ""My Left Foot."" But unlike that films main character the paralyzed artist Christy Brown his character here - like Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"" - has no redeeming qualities. Plainview is a misanthrope whose stated goal is ""to earn enough money so I can get away from everyone."" What he seems most set on however is getting away from a traumatic past that remains a mystery throughout the story. The narrative focuses on Plainviews attempts to con California landowners out of cheap leases so he can tap the oil under their feet. To that end he introduces his baby-faced young son H.W. (Dillon Freasier) as his winsome partner. ""Blood"" hangs on Plainviews relationships with his son and two other people - an itinerant worker named Henry (Kevin J. OConnor) who claims to be his half-brother and Eli Sunday (the strange-looking Paul Dano even stranger here) a self-proclaimed prophet who leads Plainview to an ""ocean of oil"" in exchange for funding his evangelical movement. The films central conflict is between Plainview a man of no faith and Sunday who claims to be relaying the word of God. Among the many extraordinary individual scenes is one where Plainview in order to score his biggest oil deal subjects himself to absolution and baptism on Sundays altar. With a grating symphonic score by Radioheads Jonny Greenwood and the constant sense of danger following Plainview ""Blood"" does not release its grip on the audience until its last bizarrely crazy minutes.jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

By David Denby Daniel Day-Lewis in Paul Thomas Andersons adaptation of Upton Sinclairs ""Oil""   Credit TOM BACHTELL Early in ""There Will Be Blood"" an enthralling and powerfully eccentric American epic (opening on December 26th) Daniel Plainview climbs down a ladder at his small silver mine. A rung breaks and Daniel (Daniel Day-Lewis) falls to the base of the shaft and smashes his leg. Hes filthy miserable gasping for breath and life. The year is 1898. Two and a half hours later (and more than thirty years later in the time span of the film) hes on the floor again this time sitting on a polished bowling lane in the basement of an enormous mansion that he has built on the Pacific Coast. Having abandoned silver mining for oil Daniel has become one of the wealthiest tycoons in Southern California. Yet hes still filthy with dirty hands and a face that glistens from too much oil raining down on him--it looks as if oil were seeping from his pores. The experience chronicled between these two moments is as astounding in its emotional force and as haunting and mysterious as anything seen in American movies in recent years. Im not quite sure how it happened but after making ""Magnolia"" (1999) and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" (2002)--skillful but whimsical movies with many whims that went nowhere--the young writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson has now done work that bears comparison to the greatest achievements of Griffith and Ford. The movie is a loose adaptation of Upton Sinclairs 1927 novel ""Oil"" but Anderson has taken Sinclairs bluff genial oilman and turned him into a demonic character who bears more than a passing resemblance to Melvilles Ahab. Stumping around on that bad leg which was never properly set Daniel Plainview--obsessed brilliant both warm-hearted and vicious--has Ahabs egotism and command. As for Daniel Day-Lewis his performance makes one think of Laurence Olivier at his most physically and spiritually audacious. At the start Daniel and a small group of workers wildcatting for oil give themselves entirely to their perilous labor. There isnt a word of dialogue. Again and again Anderson creates raptly muscular passages--men lifting hauling pounding dragging working silently in the muck and viscous slime. Yet this film is hardly the kind of glory-of-industry documentary that bored us in school. ""There Will Be Blood"" is about the driving force of capitalism as it both creates and destroys the future and the films tone is at once elated and sickened. A dissonant ominous electronic wail written by the Radiohead guitarist and composer Jonny Greenwood warns us of trouble ahead. Once the derricks are up Greenwood imitates the rhythmic thud of the drill bits and pumps with bustling passages of plucked strings and pounding sticks. ""Blood"" has the pulse of the future in its rhythms. Like the most elegiac Western this movie is about the vanishing American frontier. The thrown-together buildings look scraggly and unkempt the homesteaders are modest stubborn and reticent but in their undreamed-of future Wal-Mart is on the way. Anderson working with the cinematographer Robert Elswit has become a master of the long tracking shot across still empty landscapes. The movie which cost a relatively cheap twenty-five million dollars to make has gravity and weight without pomp; its austerely magnificent and when violence comes--an exploding oil well a fight--its staged cleanly in open space and not as a tumult of digital effects or a tempest in an editing room. One of the workers holds and kisses a baby then dies in an accident and Daniel raises the child whom he calls H.W. (Dillon Freasier) as his son and partner. The movie skips to 1911 when Daniel and H.W. are travelling around California in a tin lizzie buying up land leases at bargain rates from ranchers and farmers who are sitting on underground oceans of gold. Daniel takes advantage of their ignorance to pay them less than they deserve and as he addresses a group of them Day-Lewiss performance comes into focus. He lowers his chin slightly and his dark eyes dance with merriment as he speaks in coarse yet rounded tones the syllables precisely articulated but with a lengthening of the vowels and final consonants that gives the talk a singing almost caressing quality. It is the voice of dominating commercial logic--an American force of nature. Day-Lewis at fifty is lean and fit and his scythe-like body cuts into the air as he works or stalks head thrust out across a field. Much of the time he projects a wonderful gaiety but his Daniel never strays from business. He ignores questions reveals nothing and masters every encounter with either charm or a threat. He has no wife no friends and no interests except for oil his son and booze. He drinks heavily which exacerbates his natural distrust and competitiveness. Even when hes swimming in the Pacific he looks dangerous. In his later years however Daniel disintegrates and the iconic associations shift from Ahab to Charles Foster Kane. Upton Sinclair was a longtime socialist yet he understood that nothing in American life was more exhilarating than entrepreneurial energy and ruthlessness. The movie retains the novels exuberance but turns much darker in tone. H.W. becomes a victim of the oil rush and Anderson drops Sinclairs moral hero a Communist who organizes the oil workers. Sinclair was a reformer who wanted to ameliorate the harsh effects of capitalism but Anderson apparently reasoned that social radicalism did not--and could not--stop men like Daniel Plainview. Sinclair the garrulous fact-bound literalist has been superseded by a film poet with a pessimistic even apocalyptic streak. But Anderson does retain Sinclairs portrait of an unctuous young man who thinks he has the word of God within him Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) who creates in the oil fields the revivalist Church of the Third Revelation. Dano who was the silent philosophy-reading boy in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" has a tiny mouth and dead eyes. He looks like a mushroom on a long stem and he talks with a humble piety that gives way in church to a strangled cry of ecstatic fervor. Hes repulsive yet electrifying. Anderson has set up a kind of allegory of American development in which two overwhelming forces--entrepreneurial capitalism and evangelism--both operate on the border of fraudulence; together they will build Southern California though the two men representing them are so belligerent that they fall into combat. The movie becomes an increasingly violent (and comical) struggle in which each man humiliates the other leading to the murderous final scene which gushes as far over the top as one of Daniels wells. The scene is a mistake but I think I know why it happened. Anderson started out as an independent filmmaker with ""Hard Eight"" (1996) and ""Boogie Nights"" (1997). In ""Blood"" he has taken on central American themes and established a style of prodigious grandeur. Yet some part of him must have rebelled against canonization. The last scene is a blast of defiance--or perhaps of despair. But like almost everything else in the movie its astonishing. Working with the director Jason Reitman (""Thank You for Smoking"") the terrific comedy writer Diablo Cody has fashioned a lovely little movie ""Juno"" told entirely from the point of view of a teen-age girl. Juno (Ellen Page) who lives in a suburb of Minneapolis finds herself in a terrible fix--shes pregnant at sixteen--and her reaction to her overwhelming new situation is to treat it with the same flip pop-cult high-school sarcasm with which she addresses everything else. She goes to the local abortion clinic but finds the place disgustingly casual (they hand out flavored condoms) and she decides to carry the baby to term. Up to this point all that Juno does including having sex in a chair with her friend Bleek (Michael Cera) is based on nervy impulse and Ellen Page a young Canadian actress speaks rapidly and irritably nailing Junos lines with easy precision. Looking for adoptive parents Juno quickly finds what seems to be an ideal couple the wealthy Lorings who live in a beige-walled McMansion with furnishings out of an upscale home-decorating magazine. Mark (Jason Bateman) a fortyish composer of commercial jingles connects with Junos taste in rock music and slasher movies and his wife the beautiful Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) badly wants to be a mom. ""If I could just have the thing and give it to you now I totally would"" Juno tells them. Shes a shrewd girl and very blunt yet shes taken in by her own gift for rude comedy which as we learn masks a great deal of uncertainty. When she and Bleek fight and the Lorings marriage begins to fall apart her cool collapses into bewilderment and tears. Where are love and constancy to be found? Reitman stages Junos crisis with great tenderness and enfolds it in a witty and playful formal frame the narrative progresses through the seasons starting in autumn with the first three corresponding to Junos trimesters. The seasons are also punctuated by Kimya Dawsons plaintively funny songs and by passing groups of runners from Junos high school including Bleek whose golden shorts reveal his slender long legs--his best feature according to Juno. Michael Cera enters a scene like a soft breeze. Tall and mop-haired hes so mild it takes us a while to realize how intelligent Bleek is and how entirely he appreciates Junos humor. This couple is younger than the battling Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl in last summers unwanted-pregnancy comedy ""Knocked Up."" Theyre not ready for roughhouse in bed or anywhere else. When they argue they cant conceal their dismay even as they are winging insults at each other. ""Juno"" is a coming-of-age movie made with idiosyncratic charm and not a single false note. Shame is the driving emotion in ""The Kite Runner"" Marc Forsters sturdy movie based on Khaled Hosseinis international best-seller. As a child in Kabul in the late nineteen-seventies Amir whose family was wealthy grew up side by side with Hassan the son of his fathers servant. Hassan was a devoted even adoring friend but Amir a physical coward did not protect him against brutal violation in a Kabul alley. Having emigrated to Northern California Amir (Khalid Abdalla) carries this and subsequent betrayals of Hassan inside his soul but in 2000 hes given a chance at redemption--a possible rescue operation that requires him to go back to Afghanistan now dominated by the Taliban. Shame is rarely an active emotion and that may account in part for the movies slight stiffness and hesitancy; the dangers of staging a rape scene with children may have been inhibiting as well. One wants the actors to cut loose but young Khalid Abdalla is forced to stand around looking stricken most of the time and the director a Swiss-German worked with some of the actors through translators which slowed the tempo and killed colloquial ease--the dialogue is well written but theres dead air around the lines. The best things in ""The Kite Runner"" are the portrait of Kabuls flourishing upper-class life before the Soviets and then the Taliban took over and the depiction of the bleak hypocrisies of the Taliban period--the disgusting cruelties performed in the name of righteousness and the madness that makes it an offense to look at a womans face but acceptable to keep a young boy as a sex slave. The movies heart is certainly in the right place--its a quietly outraged work--but I wish there were more excitement in it from moment to moment.

Though epic in sweep--it covers 30 years in the life of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) a fiercely driven oil baron in early-20th-century California--its as singularly focused as those multi-character panoramas were sprawling. Because of its subject its grand Western landscapes and its tycoon protagonist Andersons movie has already been compared somewhat misleadingly with ""Giant"" and ""Citizen Kane."" However its uncompromising portrait of egotism and greed run amuck has more in common with Werner Herzogs hallucinatory ""Aguirre the Wrath of God."" And as a harrowing account of an obsessively anti-social man its emotional temperature is closer to ""Raging Bull."" What it shares with all of Andersons work is a blistering intensity--and filmmaking that can make your jaw drop.There will be no argument about Day-Lewiss staggering performance. His Plainview who starts as a bearded silver prospector in 1898 strikes his first oil in 1902 and voraciously gobbles up land in central California until his power rivals that of Standard Oil is in almost every scene of the movie and hes never loomed so large. With his chiseled features and hawk eyes that miss nothing hes a figure of intimidating intensity. But Plainview is capable when he needs to be of silver-tongued charm. Day-Lewis uses a John Huston-ish mid-Atlantic accent with a drawling magnanimous lilt that can twist into a vicious rasp when provoked. Plainviews misanthropy and his emotional isolation grow with his power. ""I look at people and see nothing worth liking"" he confesses in a rare moment of self-revelation. The only person Daniels connected to (hed never use the word ""love"") is his adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier) who provides an innocent face when hes pitching his projects to the local marks. But when H.W. is struck deaf in a drilling accident Daniel loses his lifeline to the world. It severs not just their relationship but his increasingly shaky hold on sanity.Plainviews rise runs parallel to that of Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) a baby-faced country-boy evangelist Daniel meets when buying up the Sunday family land. Eli is as ambitious and cunning in his way as Plainview--hes a spiritual empire builder and Daniel hates him for being his Bible-thumping mirror image. Their brutal rivalry a series of escalating back-and-forth humiliations that would be right at home in a Fassbinder movie threads its way to the startling near-operatic finale in 1927 at the magnates palatial estate. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week ""There Will Be Blood"" is ostensibly based on Upton Sinclairs muckraking 1927 political novel ""Oil "" but Anderson just uses it as a springboard. With the hot-button topics of oil and religion on the surface its tempting to read political messages into the movie. This wont get you very far. Though he provides an acute depiction of unfettered capitalism Andersons no more interested in political allegories than he is in psychological explanations for his protagonists avarice and spite.Anderson may be the most naturally gifted filmmaker of his generation; he seems incapable of composing a prosaic shot. Magnificently filmed by Robert Elswit and designed by Jack Fisk who re-created from scratch the makeshift towns that grew up around the oilfields ""Blood"" has a physicality so pungent you feel youre living in the past. The sense that youre witnessing a radically different kind of historical epic is reinforced by Jonny Greenwoods score (augmented with excerpts from Arvo P?rt and Brahms) which eschews period clich?s for modern dissonances that are like the movie itself both beautiful and terrifying. ""There Will Be Blood"" is ferocious and it will be championed and attacked with an equal ferocity. When the dust settles we may look back on it as some kind of obsessed classic.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Boldly and magnificently strange ""There Will Be Blood"" marks a significant departure in the work of Paul Thomas Anderson. Heretofore fixated on his native Los Angeles and most celebrated for his contempo ensemblers writer-helmer this time branches out with an intense increasingly insidious character study of a turn-of-the-century central California oil man. Theres no getting around the fact that this Paramount Vantage/Miramax co-venture reps yet another 21/2-hour-plus indie-flavored male-centric American art film a species that has recently proven difficult to market to more than rarefied audiences. Distribs will have to roll the dice and use hoped-for kudos for the film and its superb star Daniel Day-Lewis to create the impression of a must-see. Officially penning an adaptation for the first time Anderson turns out to have been inspired very loosely indeed by his source Upton Sinclairs 1927 novel ""Oil"" Pic betrays little of the tomes overview and virtually none of socialist Sinclairs muckraking instincts. Instead it is more interested in language in the twinned aspects of industry and religion on the landscape of American progress and above all in creating an obsessive almost microscopically observed study of an extreme sociopath who determinedly destroys his ties to other human beings. Notwithstanding its passing resemblance to ""Citizen Kane"" this theme is an odd one on which to build a big movie especially in view of the extreme manner in which it ends; one can only guess at Andersons personal reasons for dwelling on it with such unremitting fervor. But his commitment to going all the way must be respected in the face of conventional commercial considerations. Day-Lewis Daniel Plainview is a profoundly anti-social fellow malevolently so and ""There Will Be Blood"" devotes itself to scratching peeling and digging away at a man determined to divest himself of his past and everyone associated with it. Foregrounded by an electronic sound that soars to an almost unbearable pitch the first 15 minutes unfold with essentially no dialogue as Daniel in 1898 digs laboriously for silver and gold then moves into oil. By 1911 he is a man of some means and has a son although no wife. Tipped off about the abundance of oil in a rural area and about Standard Oils activities thereabouts Daniel visits the farm of the pious Sunday family on false pretenses obtains drilling rights at a bargain rate and immediately constructs the derricks on the property that will make his fortune. Notably distinguishing the film during this initial stretch are its fulsome physicality its linguistic distinction and the extraordinary originality of the musical score. Filmed around Marfa Texas (where both ""Giant"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" were shot) pic presents a vivid visceral account of the risky and sometimes dangerous labor it took to summon up black gold. With its functional makeshift buildings and scattered equipment lending the parched landscapes a scarred beauty Jack Fisks production design indelibly brings to life the evocative photographs that exist of such industrial communities and Robert Elswits lensing captures it all with strong widescreen compositions and muscular camera moves. More striking however is the nature of the language. Day-Lewis may well have used John Huston as a vocal model for his line deliveries and it may not be farfetched to suggest that Plainview reps a younger incarnation of Hustons memorably corrupt tycoon Noah Cross in ""Chinatown."" Beyond such a comparison however lies Andersons remarkable achievement in creating dialogue marked by different cadences than were accustomed to today with heightened formality clarity and precision that lend it a slightly theatrical quality rooted in the 19th century. The unashamedly declarative talk set against the backdrop of an America quickly transforming from rural to industrial brings to mind a bracing fusion of Eugene ONeill and John Dos Passos. On top of these elements is the sweeping surging constantly surprising score by Radioheads Jonny Greenwood which could be described as avant-garde symphonic. It develops over long sustained periods not always in precise emotional alignment with whats taking place onscreen but generally deepening and making more mysterious the films moods and meanings. Its a daring adventurous exploratory piece of work one that on its own signals the pictures seriousness. From the outset when Daniel suffers a leg injury a sense of foreboding exists that in concert with the title promises worse to come. Accidents take place on the job notably one in which Daniels son H.W. (the marvelous Dillon Freasier) now about 10 loses his hearing. Until now very close to his father the newly impaired H.W. is soon heartlessly banished by Daniel. Further disturbing developments involve Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) the son of the landowner Daniel took advantage of. A young charismatic evangelist Eli builds a considerable congregation of staunch believers in Daniels midst and while Daniel pays lip service to the community he clearly views Elis activities with contempt. Then theres the arrival of Henry (Kevin J. OConnor) a derelict who claims to be Daniels half-brother and informs him their father has recently died. A jailbird and vagabond Henry wants nothing but a menial job. Daniel takes him in and eventually confides his radically misanthropic views to him as he does to no one else. ""I hate most people"" Daniel bluntly admits. ""I want to earn enough money so I can get away from everyone."" Its an ambition money can facilitate but not before a terrible crime is committed and Daniel launches a one-man war against Standard Oil that involves acquiring more land to build an oil pipeline to the sea. Dramas final 25 minutes play out in 1927 with an ultimate reckoning among Daniel now crazy as a loon and living in Kane-like isolation Eli and the now-grown H.W. Visually and dramatically the final scene is a jaw-dropper one that fits with what has come before but may still leave even partisan viewers a bit flummoxed. The films zealous interest in a man so alienated from his brethren can be alternately read as a work abnormally fascinated by cold antisocial behavior or as a deeply humanistic tract on the wages of misanthropy. Either way Anderson has embraced his study of a malign man intimately as has Day-Lewis who as always seems so completely absorbed in his role that its difficult to imagine him emerging between takes as just an actor playing a part. Daniel is a man who will stop at nothing to achieve the unnatural state of becoming an island onto himself and Day-Lewis makes him his own. Entire cast looks to have stepped out of a photo album from a century ago. Bulky but cherubic-faced Dano (""Little Miss Sunshine"") ranges from politely deferential to frothingly enraptured in a powerful performance as the young man of God while OConnor quietly rivets as a lifelong unfortunate. Pic could have used a developed sequence or two to establish the relationship between Daniel and his right-hand man a role in which the imposing Ciaran Hinds gets short shrift. By contrast numerous other supporting players have at least one scene in which they can shine. Women count for nothing in Daniels rough and rugged world. On a craft and technical level the film is of the highest quality not least in the sound department where the mix is exceedingly complex and expressive.
