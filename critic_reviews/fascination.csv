Share Tweet In Fascination Adam Garcia plays a sullen child of privilege who broods sulks and plots ineffectual revenge after his father dies under mysterious circumstances and his mother quickly marries a malevolent usurper with sinister designs on the family fortune. But while the films outline recalls a certain classic tragedy about a melancholy Danish prince its execution brings to mind the sleaziest opuses of Zalman King the once and perhaps future monarch of lascivious softcore spectacles like Wild Orchid and Two Moon Junction. In a role thats a long way from the class and restraint which characterized his breakout film Coyote Ugly (as well as his more low-profile gig as the voice of Kangaroo Jacks sassy marsupial) Garcia plays the whiny oft-shirtless son of Jacqueline Bisset whose wet T-shirt in 1977s The Deep helped usher an entire generation of squeaky-voiced teens into puberty. Bisset still qualifies as far sexier than the films ostensible sexpot Alice Evans who portrays Garcias new step-sister/lover in a performance that truly has to be seen to be disbelieved. Nearly everything about Fascination feels overdone. At its delirious worst its as pungent a Parisian cheese shop offering a cornucopia of laughable scenes from a watery cunnilingus session that plays like a deranged cover of Elizabeth Berkleys seizure-like thrusts in Showgirls to a howler in which Garcia asks a buddy to help him dig up his dads grave for a toxicology report. There are far too many moments of unintended merriment in Fascination to recount but itd be a shame not to mention the films crowning moment of idiocy in which its young lovers just barely survive a harrowing nearly fatal automobile accident take a few seconds to ascertain that theyre not dead and then immediately have sex. Fascination contains a lot of sexual gymnastics but theyre more uncomfortable-looking than erotic. This is largely due to the deeply irritating presence of Evans whod probably turn a few heads at the typical office party but falls far short of the bombshell standards of classic femmes fatale. Shes no Lana Turner or Rita Hayworth. For that matter shes not even a Shannon Tweed or a Shannon Whirry although Fascination wouldnt feel out of place in the Cinemax-ready filmography of either actress.

Deserving recipient of a career survey at the Buenos Aires fest Hoolboom should find considerable interest in this brilliantly textured biopic-thats-not-a-biopic. A valedictory to late vid artist Colin Campbell a look at Campbells friends and lovers and a consideration of the Cold War rolled into one ""Fascination"" sets an elegant high-water mark for writer-helmer Mike Hoolboom one of Canadas most intriguing nonnarrative filmmakers. Deserving recipient of a career survey at the Buenos Aires fest Hoolboom should find considerable interest in this brilliantly textured biopic-thats-not-a-biopic which launched at Rotterdam and is a sure thing for adventurous and gay-themed confabs around the globe. As a gay artist with a keen interest in visual media -- and one of the first in Canada to take up video as a legit art form -- Campbell forged a trail that Hoolboom has followed although in a distinctly different style. Campbells lifespan (1942-2001) roughly matches that of the Cold War and ""Fascination"" is built on these two parallel tracks. A third strand features Campbells companions generally seen facing the lens as if speaking to Campbell directly. The same style of footage was shot by Hoolboom as well and is mixed in seamlessly. ""Fascination"" is a sustained dream state in which Hoolboom interweaves his threads. Included are clips from 22 Campbell videos1972-2001. His final work provides a particularly touching moment with Campbell saying to his camera ""I too have unfulfilled desires."" In a series of bold strokes that could easily have backfired Hoolboom succeeds in linking Campbells personal life (coming out as a gay man for instance) his art and the era of the Bomb in a form that resembles visual music. The work of both Hoolboom and Campbell also comment on the debilitating state of commercial television. Editor Mark Karbusicky and Hoolboom masterfully blend the widely disparate archive and newly shot material. Uncredited sound work is densely designed. FascinationCanada ProductionProduced directed written by Mike Hoolboom. CrewCamera (color/Bamp;W DV/Super-8) Hoolboom; editor Mark Karbusicky; music Reena Katz; archive research Kim Tomczak.

This so-called erotic thriller would make about as much sense run backward on a DVD player (if they could do that). Plot is not much more than a pastiche of sex scenes. Former colleague Wesley Morris (now a movie reviewer for the Boston Globe) penned a line about this snoozer that was better than any written for the movie The protagonists Adam Garcia and Alice Evans ""have the sort of chemistry that could be used in middle schools across the country to encourage abstinence."" Otherwise still looking marvelous at 60 Bisset reprises a similar role she had in ""Wild Orchid"" 15 years ago. A potential viewer would be better off renting that and forgetting ""Fascination"" altogether.

"Adrift in the sea of torpidity - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Adrift in the sea of torpidityJanuary 31 2005|Kevin Crust | Times Staff Writer January is the Angeles Crest Highway for the disposal of bad movies and that dumping of celluloid corpses plagued us right through the months final weekend. ""Fascination"" a stupendously torpid thriller without a single redeeming quality opened Friday without review screenings.Set in the Florida Keys (but shot principally in Puerto Rico) the film begins with a wealthy middle-aged man Patrick Doherty (James Naughton) getting his head bashed against some rocks in a swimming accident accompanied by the portentous beat of the films score. Ten minutes into the movie and you fast realize hes the lucky one never having to spit out another line of the films dopey dialogue.From there director Klaus Menzels screenplay displays the structural integrity of a wet newspaper tossing off red herrings with alacrity. Dohertys tan glamorous widow Maureen (Jacqueline Bisset) no sooner returns from a cruise on the arm of a sturdy Brit Oliver Vance (Stuart Wilson) -- much to the dismay of her brooding young composer son Scott (Adam Garcia) -- than theyre planning their nuptials.That his dad earned an Olympic medal for swimming (40 years earlier) causes Scott to suspect the death was not accidental leaving him easy prey for Olivers manipulative but beguiling daughter Kelly (Alice Evans). When Scott storms out of the wedding Kelly is quick to comfort her soon-to-be stepbrother with some vigorous rooftop sex triggering an apparently passion-driven rainstorm.Initially the only intriguing character Kelly unfortunately fades from femme fatale long before the Tantric sex kicks in and the final credits roll. Kelly prefaces the films big ""reveals"" by looking meaningfully at Scott and saying ""Ive got to tell you something."" Inevitably its either something the audience will already have figured out or new information so far out of left field that she seems to be making it up on the spot.Evans and Garcia exhibit little chemistry in their perfume-ad-inspired love scenes and the beaches and resort-like Doherty residence do little other than recommend the locations as a vacation destination. ""Fascination"" thankfully fades from memory as fast as most January releases.`FascinationMPAA rating R for strong sexuality and for language.Times guidelines The sex is about as stimulating as Sanka.Adam Garcia...Scott DohertyJacqueline Bisset...MaureenAlice Evans...Kelly VanceStuart Wilson...Oliver VanceJames Naughton...Patrick DohertyA Quality Films/Classicmap production released by MGM.

Thats right they kill off James Naughton who plays her husband in the second scene.This being a so-called thriller there is something suspicious about his death a drowning. ""He was a world-class swimmer"" Scott (Adam Garcia) the Dohertys son notes at the reading of the will. ""Something isnt right.""And the suspicions are just beginning. Maureen takes a restorative cruise and comes home with a new boyfriend Oliver Vance (Stuart Wilson) who may not really be so new. They promptly announce their engagement. (""We asked you both here tonight to tell you"" Maureen begins in an example of the movies trite-and-true dialogue. Earlier Oliver compliments the handsome Scott saying ""Ill bet you have to beat them off with a stick."") Luckily when Scott gets upset at the wedding Olivers sexy daughter Kelly (Alice Evans) is around to ease his pain. They have sex on the roof of the local City Hall. Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are questions about drugs in the dead mans system (herbal sleeping pills versus blood-pressure medication) an amateur exhumation a mysterious telephone call about developing a beachfront property that Scott treasures in its natural state. There are numerous revelations -- so numerous in fact that the plot goes way past believable and by the time Kelly says ominously ""I have something to tell you"" for what seems like the 100th time theres nothing to do but groan.""Fascination"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for frequent profanity a lethal explosion two car accidents and several unconvincing lovemaking scenes with partial nudity.Fascination Opened nationwide yesterday.Produced written and directed by Klaus Menzel; based on a screenplay by Darly Haney and John Jacobs; director of photography Reinhart Peschke; edited by Toby Yates; music by John Du Prez; production designer Marc Grenville-Masson; released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures.

Set in Florida -- albeit a bland version of the state that could pass for Ohio around Lake Erie -- ""Fascination"" is meant to be a suspenseful sexy contemporary film noir with twists aplenty. Instead it plays like a soft-core-porn potboiler left over from the 1970s about a hot vampire chick. _____More in Movies_____  Fascination Reviews and Showtimes  Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Oscars Coverage  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Ostensibly the plot concerns Scott (Adam Garcia) a young man concerned that his freshly widowed mother (Jacqueline Bisset) and her smarmy new beau Oliver (Stuart Wilson) may have had something to do with the mysterious drowning death a few weeks earlier of Scotts world-class-swimmer dad played in a mercifully short cameo by James Naughton. (Gosh do ya think? ""Hamlet"" was more subtle.) Heres where the soft-core kicks in. Just as suddenly as Mommy and Oliver hook up Olivers sexy daughter Kelly (Alice Evans) appears arousing Scotts libido along with his suspicions as she drops hints about her fathers past. Rapidly the two tumble into bed each session accompanied by cheesy soundtrack music reminiscent of Donna Summer and the Andrea True Connection. (Actually bed is the most boring place they do it preferring the thrill of a rooftop and a swimming pool where Kelly nearly drowns Scott during a particularly strenuous encounter.) The vampire part? Although the script is mum on this critical plot point circumstantial evidence would suggest that Kelly is a closet bloodsucker given the fact that she bites a guy on the ear and then later is sexually aroused at the sight of Scott with a slight scratch. Later still some nameless walk-on is shown with for no apparent reason a giant three-inch-square Band-Aid on his neck. Obviously another victim. Okay I admit it. Thats the movie I wanted to see. Instead I sat through something whose predictability managed to be both howlingly funny and crushingly dull with a performance by a lead whose acting looks like hes trying to decide between the mushroom-Swiss burger and the Monte Cristo on the menu -- and thats when hes aroused. FASCINATION (R 102 minutes) --Contains bad words some violence and pool sex rooftop sex mosquito-net sex and shadowy veranda sex. At the Regal Gallery Place Stadium.

"Fascination an unerotic unthriller - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Fascination an unerotic unthriller By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 28 2005 Fascination"" a nominal erotic thriller whose story I still cant decipher does raise a few important questions. For instance when two suspected spouse killers get married who dies first? And can things bode well for the new family when his daughter and her son slip out of the wedding ceremony to make love on a slanted roof in a sudden rainstorm?Im afraid this is one of those movies one where plot"" is another word for gratuitous sex scene."" Here the young lovers are Scott (Adam Garcia) and Kelly (Alice Evans) brand new stepsiblings who do indeed go about their consummation on the day of Mom and Dads nuptials. Hes miffed that his mother Maureen (Jacqueline Bisset) has agreed to marry Oliver (Stuart Wilson) so soon after his fathers mysterious death -- and while on vacation (What is it about cruise ships?"" Kelly wonders.)Oliver meanwhile is a widower himself. His wife died mysteriously too. And eventually we find out -- well I found out (you reader should stay away and just take my word for it) -- that the deaths bear some relation to each other. Figuring this out though requires the two kids to sit around Maureens Puerto Rican Shangri La and have numerous expository conversations. Kelly it seems is already trying to plant seeds of suspicion in her new lovers head. Scotts dad was a silver-medalist swimmer in the 1964 Olympics but he died in a swimming accident. Its weird"" she says. Then she tells a story of how her father might have been mixed up in her mothers death. What is Kelly up to?Scott confronts his mother with his doubts about her new husband. Shes taken aback For someone as young and for someone as artistically inclined as you are youve become quite judgmental."" Who can say what one thing has to do with the other but what more can you expect from a movie whose production notes make no immediate mention of a screenwriter?Some digging around does reveal that the German-born first-time director Klaus Menzel got ahold of Daryl Haney and John Jacobss ancient script (its from 1989). Now came the hard part making it my own"" the notes quote him as saying. So perhaps we have only him to thank for a line like Let me kiss you through the pain"" which Kelly whispers to Scott before their sopping wet rooftop tryst gets underway. (Thank you Klaus. Thank you so much.)Its believable that the screenplay was originally a parody but it was written at a time when erotic thrillers had a certain sleazy seriousness. Say it with me Wild Orchid."" (Incidentally that movie also starred Bisset as a woman filled with lust and danger whenever Mickey Rourke was around.) Fifteen years later its possible that Menzels flaccid movie just feels parodic because no one says I want you to dig up my fathers grave"" anymore and means it.Garcia who was Piper Perabos charismatic boy toy in Coyote Ugly"" once seemed bound for minor stardom. So much for that. Here he seems to be strangling his native Australian accent in order to speak in a flat American-ish voice. Evans is worse. Whenever she delivers a line her face twitches and contorts as though she were having an allergic reaction to her dialogue. Theres better acting in the display windows of some department stores.Garcia and Evans have the sort of chemistry that could be used at middle schools across the country to encourage abstinence. The couple enjoys one long unsexy dance at a nightclub on the beach that will make you never want to go near that stepsibling hookup fantasy again.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.
