Tyler makes dutiful love to the bubbles the chassis the spurting garden hose. The sequence set to a cover of Gary Wrights ""Love Is Alive"" unfolds like a particularly yummy piece of Madison Avenue consumer porn. But the entire sudsy peep show turns out to be the set-up for a ba-dum-bum punchline as Tylers bartender sap of a boyfriend played by Matt Dillon at his most gawky-stupido turns to his cousin (Paul Reiser) and says ""You should see what she does with my hose"" Talk about a joke that leaves the audience limp. How exactly should one pinpoint the awfulness of One Night at McCools? More than just dumb the picture is embarrassingly dorky. Its like a bad-sitcom version of a Tarantino film noir as directed by Ed Wood from a script by Alex Portnoy. Theres a weirdly dated quality to the movies overstatement whether its the mother-fixation jokes the ""naughty"" bondage jokes a dual appearance by the former Andrew Dice Clay (still bellowing but now billed as Andrew Silverstein -- as if that would make us forget) a bedroom tryst accompanied by the imaginative disco lyrics ""sexy body"" or Tylers breathy naive neo-Marilyn shtick as a vamp named Jewel whos obsessed with home furnishings and who seduces one geek after another even though she could almost be wearing a sign that reads ""Not What She Seems."" Why would someone make a movie centered around a bar named McCools anyway? They might as well have called it the Totally Happenin Bro Saloon. Michael Douglas who shows up as a horndog in an ugly graying Elvis pompadour produced this mess which makes you wonder whether he owed somebody a favor. No one emerges from One Night at McCools unscathed but I only hope that Liv Tyler doesnt allow herself to be converted from promising ingenue to walking pinup. There are far better tactics for becoming a star than sudsing your way to glory.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Publicity Photo Matt Dillon and Liv Tyler star in ""One Night at McCools."" Publicity Photo FILM CLIPS /Also opening today 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Baise-moi Murder thriller. Starring Raffaela Anderson and Karen Bach. Directed and written by Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trinh Thi. (Not rated. 76 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Roxie Cinema.) Arriving with an aura of controversy and a ""banned in France"" packaging sticker ""Baise-moi"" is more than a deliberate act of provocation. Its a bizarre hybrid one part feminist screed one part French art film and one part skin flick. Co-directed by Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trinh Thi ""Baise-moi"" apes the ""Thelma amp; Louise"" model of raging chicks on the lam by following blase hooker Nadine (Karen Bach) and crusty porn actress Manu (Raffaela Anderson) on a remorseless killing spree across France. Thats the whole story right there Find a man have sex with him then kill him and laugh at the remains. The films attitude is found in its name The official English title is ""Rape Me"" but the literal translation cant be printed here. In a prologue ""Baise-moi"" creates a social context for its tale of hell- bent female reprisal. After Manu and a girlfriend are gang-raped in an abandoned garage she goes to her boyfriend who only wants to know who did it -- not how she feels. By the time she meets Nadine and invites her on her road trip to hell both women are ready as Manu says ""to let rip the motherf-- side of our soul"" The more they kill the more they like it. John Waters used to make movies like this -- about nasty asocial women who turn to anarchy when the world gives them a raw deal -- but he did it for laughs and didnt mix his satire with half-baked messages about corrective revenge and the power gap between men and women. The politics are blurry at best in ""Baise-moi."" Whatever message it wants to impart is overwhelmed by shoddy technique (it was shot badly on digital video) and a tendency to embrace the kind of exploitation with which its supposedly in conflict. Advisory This movie contains raw language graphic violence and sex. -- Edward Guthmann ONE NIGHT AT MCCOOLS Comedy. Starring Liv Tyler  Matt Dillon  John Goodman  Michael Douglas . Directed by Harald Zwart . (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Liv Tyler your dad called. It seems he and his band want their video back. What? You dont know what were talking about? Why ""One Night at McCools"" where you get all wet and soapy while washing that car. Its a shamelessly dumb scene -- notable for the growling Joan Osborne song to which Tyler scrubs -- in a shamelessly dumb movie. Tyler must have gotten the whole shooting script wet filming that scene because theres really no evidence of there ever having been one. Aerosmith videos are more fun. Shes all video ho here -- decolletage and short-shorts first; character second -- no fourth really. To her credit Tyler seems to be going for some kind of low-rent Ashley Judd femme fatale. But the movie lurches from bad comedy to sinful pathos leaving noir under the very Dumpster that violently buries one character -- and 90 minutes too late frankly. Tylers Jewel gets thrown out of her hubbys car one night at McCools. Matt Dillon tends bar there and soon hes tending to her. Soon after that her husbands dead. Then detective John Goodman shows up then somehow attorney Paul Reiser gets involved then so does hired assassin Michael Douglas then final-insult Andrew Dice Clay shows up for the shootout finale cued to ""YMCA."" Its Kmart Tarantino all the way. Blinded by horniness the men here cant think straight and neither can the movie which is why it all feels like a needless thankless charmless shout-out to the 80s rock video. That was an art form where it was cool in its brevity to let a pair of bodacious ta-tas and breathy speech patterns make the entire project go lame. But 90 minutes of drooling? For that the studio executives who green-lighted this thing should be consigned to wipe the mouths of the underage boys whove sneaked in to ogle. Advisory This movie contains sexual situations and profanity. -- Wesley Morris THE LUZHIN DEFENCE Tragicomedy. Starring Emily Watson and John Turturro. Directed by Marleen Gorris. (PG-13. 106 minutes. At Embarcadero Center Cinemas.) Chess genius Alexander Luzhin is monomaniacal about the game until he glimpses Russian emigre aristocrat Natalia and instantly makes a niche in his life for something else her. Otherwise he is unkempt preoccupied awkward socially inept cant follow an ordinary train of thought or talk straight. In fact he has no small talk whatsoever. She thinks he is the most interesting man she has ever met. In ""The Luzhin Defence"" director Marleen Gorris (""Antonias Line"") and screenwriter Peter Berry have freely adapted Vladimir Nabokovs novel about a distracted chess master who goes over the edge. When the film sticks with the eccentric comedy of a highborn woman attracted to a preoccupied genius it works splendidly. When it strays into melodrama it is as ill-equipped as Luzhin. Emily Watson and John Turturros performances make the film. Soignee but with a gleam in her eye Natalia (Watson) resists her snobbish mothers distaste for Luzhin. The awkward chess genius calls for a bravura performance and Turturro delivers one. As Luzhin slides further into disarray the audience will want to protect him as much as Natalia does. With all too much regularity however Turturro gets a distant look in his eyes that signals a flashback to childhood and his parents troubled marriage. Putting these pieces together becomes hardly worth the effort. By the time the center of gravity shifts to a villain who exploits Luzhin the pleasure of following this film has turned to impatience. ""The Luzhin Defence"" depicts a sparkling present in the late 20s at a lavish hotel on Lake Como in Italy and a dark past in St. Petersburg. -- Bob Graham CHOPPER Drama. Starring Eric Bana. Directed and written by Andrew Dominik. (Not rated. 94 minutes. At the Lumiere Shattuck in Berkeley Rafael Film Center in San Rafael Towne 3 in San Jose.) In Australia where he bungled a kidnapping attempt and sliced off his ears to secure a prison transfer Mark ""Chopper"" Read is a folk hero and a best- selling author. In this blunt hard-edged comedy from writer-director Andrew Dominik hes equal parts monster buffoon wounded child and cunning tattooed sociopath. Dominick has a distinct visual style -- Kubrick austerity seems to be his model -- but his portrait of Chopper is episodic impressionistic. It feels ragged and inspecific as if he hadnt made up his mind about his central character and was content to let scenes play out without an authorial overview. Its Eric Bana a popular Australian stand-up comic who justifies our interest with a dazzling performance of blunt humor unpredictability and an edge of menace. Theres no way to predict the mood swings of this Chopper He may stab a prison mate in the eye then collapse in pitying tears. Remorse morphs into rage; lies and truth form one unruly knot. Although Dominick remains unresolved about his character his wry take on the deification of criminals in a tabloid world is spot-on. The press the public even prison officials are enchanted by Choppers goony bluster. Never mind that he killed upward of 19 people Hes got star quality he makes good copy and hes a distraction from dull routine. For Chopper crime not only pays; its also sexy scintillating and an antidote to tedium.

(USA) I have a suggestion for USA Films distributor of the sexy black comedy ""One Night at McCools"" Make sure any theater that agrees to show it promises to schedule it as the second title of a double feature with ""Driven"" the execrably bad racing drama starring (and ""written"" by) Sylvester Stallone. That way anyone still left in the theater when ""McCools"" starts is guaranteed to love it as much as I did. I cant really be sure if the movie - starring Liv Tyler as a femme fatale who wraps Matt Dillon Paul Reiser and John Goodman around her perfectly nail-polished pinkie - is actually as entertaining as it seemed. Having just stumbled out of the Stallone abomination a few short hours earlier a marathon of nature documentaries would at that point probably have had me in stitches. Still I think its a pretty good film regardless. The first positive sign? Michael Douglas in a graying Elvis pompadour. As Mr. Burmeister a mysterious man in a seedy Missouri bingo parlor met by Matt Dillon in the films opening scene Douglas is the rare movie star comfortable enough to allow himself to be upstaged by his own hair. The rug alone in fact is worth the price of admission. The second good sign? Liv Tyler. Okay. As Jewel a pretty con artist who sets out to rob then ends up falling for a bartender named Randy (Dillon) Tyler doesnt really have to act much - at least not much more than one gets from the standard hair-tossing shampoo spokesmodel. But boy is she easy on the eyes. Wait Im getting ahead of myself. Back to Burmeister. Randy has a story to tell him as well as a favor to ask him and both involve Jewel. Simultaneously a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser) is telling the same story - albeit from his point of view - to his shrink (a wonderfully deadpan Reba McEntire) while across town a police detective named Dehling (John Goodman) is unburdening himself to his priest Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins) . . . also as it happens about Jewel. Shes some woman. It seems that she and her thug boyfriend Utah have made a modest career out of seducing guys then burglarizing them. But when Jewel finds herself attracted to intended victim Randy (see its a bad idea to sleep with the mark if youre going to kill him later) the only obvious solution is for her to shoot Utah. By the way Utah is played by former stand-up comic Andrew ""Dice"" Clay using his real name Andrew Silverstein and almost unrecognizable under a modified samurai topknot. Are you getting the idea that hair is some kind of theme here? Long story short Carl (who happens to be Randys cousin) and Detective Dehling (whos investigating Utahs death) both fall for Jewel leading as they say in the flack business to ""hilarious complications"" all of them narrated a la ""Rashomon"" from three distinct points of view. First-time feature director Harald Zwart has a real flair for farce (not to mention an apparent love of wigs) and he keeps the outrageous high jinks of the script (penned by newcomer Stan Seidel who died last year) lively yet grounded in reality. Assisted in this by his able ensemble Zwart knows better than to push the already way-out material further than it need go. In a wry touch the films climax - a shootout between Utahs twin brother Elmo and Dehling in full cop regalia Carl in bondage gear a jeans-clad Randy and a statue of a carved wooden Indian - is set to the Village Peoples party anthem ""YMCA."" And what of Mr. Burmeister? Sorry but telling would spoil the sinfully dumb fun.""One Night at McCools"" (R 93 minutes) - Contains obscenity gunplay assault and battery sex scenes and sex-related dialogue humor and fantasy sequences.

(USA) Had it been made in the late 40s ""One Night at McCools"" would have played straight no chaser - a black-and-white fable about a dame with fetching ways and no soul at all. She jerks men up down and sideways until the chump change falls out of their pockets and they end up whacking each other in a night-street gunfight. I see Jane Greer as the babe and Burt Lancaster Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas as the chumps. Its noir variant No. 432 sub-category B-IV the femme fatale. But its the early 00s and possibly we lack the moral conviction to assign evil that un-self-consciously. In our grayer era the thing is played for laughs so broad that the final shootout is more like a pie fight taking place in a knickknacky living room where the gunfire chews up the upholstery and sends feathers tumbling through the air. And there is a Douglas but its only Kirks dull son Michael under a polyester wig that makes him look like a glum reject from the Kevin Costner role in ""3000 Miles to Graceland."" Douglas as it turns out is the dullest thing in the movie which otherwise builds up some energy in its permutations of feckless male behavior in thrall to a beauty of a woman who dresses to emphasize that in certain areas God has been very generous to her. You may point out that they havent made many movies like this in 40 years so whats the point of an elaborate parody this late in the game? Gee wish I knew. But on its own terms ""One Night at McCools"" is fun if youre inclined toward cynicism contempt nihilism and cool stuff like that. It seems to take its inspiration from that famous moment in ""Body Heat"" when Kathleen Turner comments on William Hurts lack of excess IQ points and then adds ""I like that in a man."" ""One Night at McCools"" also likes that in its men. The film is structured film noir style around three confessions as the three chumps unburden themselves. The bartender Randy (Matt Dillon) is detoxifying himself by telling his tale to a hit man (Douglas) hes just hired to set things right; Randys lawyer cousin Carl (Paul Reiser) to a shrink (played in a clever casting twist by country music star Reba McEntire); and the investigating detective Dehling (John Goodman) to his priest. All three have been roughed up plenty by this frail. Shes Minnie the Moocher as Nietzschean ueber-woman. Each tells essentially the same story and each begins at the same point the moment he saw Jewel. To see Jewel to paraphrase the late Harold Brodkey is to see Marxism die. The young actress Liv Tyler fills the role - entirely I might add. Is Tyler a bit young for this sort of thing and should the director Dutchman Harald Zwart arrange her for examination by the camera so clinically? Well maybe yes maybe no but neither possibility occurred to me at the time. In any event in the parking lot outside McCools Randy rescues her from her abusive boyfriend (played by Andrew Silverstein who also performs under his real fake name Andrew Dice Clay) and is rewarded by - well we cant go there. But its all a setup. The boyfriend shows up (at Randys place) to rob the sex-daffy man but it turns out Jewel really does have affection for Randy which she expresses by blowing a .357 through her boyfriends skull. Or maybe she just saw ""Dice Rules."" But then she cons Randy into taking the fall for the killing which is adjudicated through the good offices of the smitten detective Dehling as justifiable homicide. Meanwhile Carl who glimpsed Jewel in the same parking lot has invited his cousin and the new girlfriend to dinner at his suburban house where he paws her pitifully in front of his yuppie wife and kids. The mechanism here is clever Each man is a victim of his own romantic delusion and each insists on seeing in Jewel his own wish fulfillment. For Randy shes the good woman who will replicate his sweet Ma for the far kinkier Carl shes the bad woman who will use the old riding crop in places where the moon dont shine and for the religious Dehling shes an angel who needs his suffocating protection. Nobody gets that shes pretty much in the game for herself and soon enough shes manipulating Randy into a burglary career tormenting Carl for the pleasure of it (the motive for her attraction to Carl seems to get lost in the shuffle) and conning the poor big cop into taking up her cause by filing a restraining order against Randy (whom shes kicked out of his own house). Toward the end the plotting becomes a little suspect particularly when Silverstein reappears as his previous characters yet-more-evil twin. When the guns come out the world is pretty much turned to Swiss cheese with nary a last man standing. And could Douglas have been encouraged to act even a little? But its funny in a cynical way especially the hyper-verbal Reiser who spins himself as much as he spins his shrink and ends up for his troubles running down the street in handcuffs and leather with a leash around his neck and panic on his face. I like that in a man.""One Night at McCools"" (92 minutes) is rated R for profanity violence and sexual intensity.

"CNN.com - Entertainment - Not enough laughs for One Night at McCools"" - April 27 2001 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION CAREER IN-DEPTH QUICK NEWS LOCAL COMMUNITY MULTIMEDIA E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe set your edition Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Danish Japanese Korean Arabic Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW Liv is lovely film is flimsy Not enough laughs for One Night at McCools In this story Lots of blood few good laughs Looks good sounds bad RELATED SITES By Paul TataraCNN.com reviewer (CNN) -- ""One Night at McCools"" a so-so black comedy that pretty much hinges on Liv Tylers come-hither gaze is plot-heavy but about as involving as a stick of gum. Tyler plays a sultry bimbo named Jewel whose considerable charms wreak instantaneous havoc on various male libidos. Jewel knows what she wants and she knows how to manipulate people to get it. And that means trouble. The story is told by three different men all of whom view Jewel as a soft-focus Pandoras box of carnal delight. Randy (Matt Dillon) is the bartender at a little joint called McCools. He tells his version of the story at a bingo parlor while hiring an absurdly pompadour-laden hit man named Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas). Randys cousin Carl (Paul Reiser) is a successful lawyer who describes his longing to a generic psychotherapist (country singer Reba McEntire for no discernible reason). And Detective Dehling (John Goodman) is a police officer who sees elements of his late wife in Jewels megawatt sultriness. Dehling confesses his shameless lust to an increasingly aroused priest (Richard Jenkins). Lots of blood few good laughs The first few scenes are the strongest in the movie. Theres a cartoonish quality to the events the pace is quick and some of the humor is engagingly goofy. One joke in which a lamp thats been outfitted with The Clapper keeps turning on and off during a noisy bout of sex gets a solid laugh. Unfortunately by the final half-hour the gags have devolved into endless shots of a man in apparently hilarious bondage gear. Theres also a violence-laden conclusion thats way too bloody to be funny. The story is told in flashback as Randy explains to Burmeister why he wants Jewel dead. He meets her one night while hes closing McCools. A greasy creep named Utah (Andrew Silverstein) seemingly kicks semi-clad Jewel out of his car in anger leaving her to stew in the clubs parking lot. Randy a nincompoop takes Jewel to his ramshackle home and quite understandably has sex with her. Utah then shows up to rob Randy. But Jewel cant follow through with the premeditated crime and thoughtfully kills Utah to protect her new bedmate. She then convinces Randy to pretend that he shot Utah in self-defense in order to cover up the murder. What Randy doesnt know is that married-man Carl spied Jewel that night in the parking lot and he cant stop fantasizing about her. Detective Dehling on the other hand immediately recognized that Randy was lying about the killing but hes much more concerned with Jewels hot body than he is with Randy.

"USATODAY.com - Uneven McCools a strange but frothy brew Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/30/2001 - Updated 1210 PM ET Uneven McCools a strange but frothy brewBy Andy Seiler USA TODAY One Night at McCools (out of four) Stars Liv Tyler Matt Dillon John Goodman Paul Reiser Michael Douglas Director Harald Zwart Distributor USA Films Rating R for violence sexuality and language The good news One Night at McCools ends with a spectacular surprise sight gag.The bad news The surprise and the joke are ruined if youve seen the TV commercial.The good news Michael Douglas as a sideburned toupeed bingo-playing big-toothed hit man in McCools may be doing some of the best acting of his career.The bad news The usually delectable Liv Tyler as the kind of irresistible femme fatale Kathleen Turner used to play may be doing the worst of hers.Since the movie is like a white- trash Rashomon Tyler like the heroine of that Kurosawa classic has to play the same scenes different ways.Lets just say one or two of them are beyond her breathy range.(Paradoxically Andrew Silverstein -- aka Andrew Dice Clay -- plays two contrasting cameo roles and does them both quite well.)The good news/bad news scenario sums up One Night at McCools. For every element that makes you want to tell everyone to rush out and see it theres another that makes this 93 minutes feel like a long night indeed.More good news McCools tries very hard to be different from other movies.More bad news The experiments dont always come off.Directed with the fast-paced frenzy of a clever TV commercial (which is what first-time director Harald Zwart is famous for) McCools shreds conventional plot exposition. The late Stan Seidels script is awash in contradicting flashbacks as three men remember the same events at the bar in wildly diverging ways.Matt Dillon plays the easygoing bartender. Paul Reiser plays his cousin an atrocious attorney drowning his sorrows. And John Goodman is a lonely widower and police detective who wants to know how a body ended up on the barroom floor.This motley crew has one thing in common They all fall in love with sex bomb Jewel (Tyler) a con-artist floozy with middle-class dreams. And they all confess their sorry stories -- to a sneering shrink a priest and a crook in a bingo parlor.All poor Jewel craves is a hideous home with a good stereo -- and shell do anything for (or to) any man to get one.""I got a boombox but only one of the speakers is working so I dont know if youd call it a stereo"" Dillon tells her.Thanks to lines like these even when the film makes no sense its still an enjoyably off-beat exercise.In other words you may enjoy One Night -- but you may feel guilty about it in the morning.

Tyler makes dutiful love to the bubbles the chassis the spurting garden hose. The sequence set to a cover of Gary Wrights ""Love Is Alive"" unfolds like a particularly yummy piece of Madison Avenue consumer porn. But the entire sudsy peep show turns out to be the set-up for a ba-dum-bum punchline as Tylers bartender sap of a boyfriend played by Matt Dillon at his most gawky-stupido turns to his cousin (Paul Reiser) and says ""You should see what she does with my hose"" Talk about a joke that leaves the audience limp. How exactly should one pinpoint the awfulness of One Night at McCools? More than just dumb the picture is embarrassingly dorky. Its like a bad-sitcom version of a Tarantino film noir as directed by Ed Wood from a script by Alex Portnoy. Theres a weirdly dated quality to the movies overstatement whether its the mother-fixation jokes the ""naughty"" bondage jokes a dual appearance by the former Andrew Dice Clay (still bellowing but now billed as Andrew Silverstein -- as if that would make us forget) a bedroom tryst accompanied by the imaginative disco lyrics ""sexy body"" or Tylers breathy naive neo-Marilyn shtick as a vamp named Jewel whos obsessed with home furnishings and who seduces one geek after another even though she could almost be wearing a sign that reads ""Not What She Seems."" Why would someone make a movie centered around a bar named McCools anyway? They might as well have called it the Totally Happenin Bro Saloon. Michael Douglas who shows up as a horndog in an ugly graying Elvis pompadour produced this mess which makes you wonder whether he owed somebody a favor. No one emerges from One Night at McCools unscathed but I only hope that Liv Tyler doesnt allow herself to be converted from promising ingenue to walking pinup. There are far better tactics for becoming a star than sudsing your way to glory.
