Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) a frustrated video-game designer and Ryan (Jake Johnson) a swaggering yet floundering former college-football star are best friends and roommates in Los Angeles. Wearing L.A.P.D. uniforms en route to a costume party they find that they instantly inspire respect and fear. Their full-on impersonation of officers gets the pair involved in actual crime fighting; soon they recruit the department in their freelance scheme to bring down a drug kingpin. The comedy has a subject--power its abuse and the nearly orgasmic thrill of wielding it with impunity--but Wayans and Johnsons playful banter and antics miss the mark. Justins inhibitions and Ryans reckless bravado are the point; the chillingly gung-ho darkness that Johnson lends his comic riffs would be the story if only the director Luke Greenfield didnt play the movie solely for laughs which are few and far between.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

"Lets Be Cops - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Lets Be Cops Posted by Christy Lemire on August 17 2014 1 Comment 20th Century Fox R for language including sexual references some graphic nudity violence and drug use. Running time 109 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. Being a buddy-cop movie that knows its a buddy-cop movie simply is not enough. ""21 Jump Street"" and the surprisingly superior sequel ""22 Jump Street"" were self-aware in a snappy clever way. They had a lively giddy energy about them. They subverted a genre while simultaneously being true to it -- a tricky balancing act to pull off well. ""Lets Be Cops"" is a high-concept comedy predicated on a single simple joke What would happen if a couple of regular guys pretended to be police officers? The movies tag line tells you everything you need to know ""Fake Cops. Real Trouble."" This notion might have worked perfectly well in sketch form but stretched out to feature length -- in a film thats overlong at nearly two hours -- it grows thin repetitive and wearying. Its too bad too because Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. actually seem to have an easy chemistry with each other. The co-stars of TVs ""New Girl"" team up here as longtime friends from Ohio who find themselves flailing in Los Angeles as they hit 30. Johnsons Ryan is a former college quarterback and would-be actor whose best-known credit is a commercial for herpes medication. Wayans Justin works at a video game company where his boss rudely rejects his police-themed idea in favor of a hackneyed concept involving zombies. Through a convoluted series of mishaps and misunderstandings that we wont trouble you with here Justin and Ryan end up wearing police uniforms and walking the streets of L.A. Lo and behold they find themselves the objects of respect and even desire. Suddenly drunk with their own sense of power (and high too when they confiscate a kids joint) the fellas set off to find out just how far they can go in their disguises. Oddly this section reminded me of the thrilling sense of discovery Tobey Maguire enjoys in the first ""Spider-Man"" movie as he tests his abilities and pushes his boundaries post-spider bite. But that sense of excitement quickly dissipates. From here director Luke Greenfield (the underappreciated ""The Girl Next Door"" the horrendous ""Something Borrowed"") working from a script he co-wrote with Nicholas Thomas operates in an extended mode of straining. The tension comes from one source Ryans desire to continue the ruse vs. Justins fear of committing a federal offense. Admittedly the few scattered laughs that exist here come from Ryans obsessive drive to immerse himself in law enforcement even going so far as to buy a squad car off eBay. But again theres only so far you can take this joke once youve established it. The actual danger in which they find themselves -- involving generic Russian baddies smuggled weapons and a hidden tunnel -- feels like an afterthought. Theres a lot of noise but the notion that theyre deeply invested in solving a crime (with the help of Rob Riggle as an actual officer) provides little in the way of stakes or suspense. More often Greenfield resorts to cheap and borderline offensive slapstick a commercial burglary in which a heavyset naked dudes balls end up on Wayans face or a domestic dispute in which a trio of black sorority sisters with stereotypically ghetto names bitch-slap each other. Natasha Leggero goes to waste as a druggy slutty weirdo whose apartment Justin and Ryan use for a stakeout. (Keegan-Michael Key does have an amusing cameo though as the grill-wearing thug informant who becomes the pals unlikely ally.) Then again all the women in ""Lets Be Cops"" are rendered as oversexed idiotic or both. The one supposed good girl in the film a waitress Justins had a crush on who finally responds to him when she thinks hes a police officer is likable enough as played by Nina Dobrev. But then the pretty leggy actress is relegated to a wardrobe of ass-hugging denim shorts and tight T-shirts and she talks wistfully of her fondness for bad boys who mistreat her. Shes passive and in need of rescuing -- by a real cop or even a fake one. Hows that for a hackneyed concept? Tweet Category Reviews Tags 21 Jump Street 22 Jump Street comedy Damon Wayans Jr. Jake Johnson Keegan-Michael Key Los Angeles Luke Greenfield Natasha Leggero New Girl Nina Dobrev Rob Riggle One Comment on ""Lets Be Cops"" September 25 2014  by  Ronson     Christy Great to see your review. The trailer for this movie was incredible... a couple of underachieving bros who find a second chance at ""being something"" by posing as cops. However I just saw the movie and it was such a disappointment. Esp. compared to 21 Jump Street the on screen relationship in this movie was poorly developed. I also thought they shouldve spent more time focusing on the dudes lack of achievement so to make their newfound status as cops more amazing. And yes they really did turn every female in that movie into some sort of gimmick. TLDR great concept great trailer poor movie. Better watch 21 Jump Street instead.

"Lets Be Real << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Unleash the Franchise  Next Hulk Hogan on his final encounter with the Ultimate Warrior Facebook Twitter Print Movies Lets Be Real Lets Be Cops cop movies and the shooting in Ferguson by Wesley Morris on August 15 2014 All movies choose their moment. Its called a release date. Some moments however choose their movies. And it looks as if the moment has chosen Lets Be Cops. But lets be clear No one should choose this movie. Its a title in search of a plot. It could also have been called Lets Be Funnier Lets Be Directed Lets Be 15 to 30 Minutes Shorter Lets Be 22 Jump Street. Right now though this is our only movie starring law enforcement run amok at a moment when much of the nation is outraged that actual law enforcement is doing the same. Last Saturday police shot Michael Brown an 18-year-old from Ferguson Missouri a suburb 20 minutes northwest of St. Louis just east of the airport. Reports that he was unarmed that his dead body was left on the hot August street for four hours and that he was less than a week away from his first day of college have incited days of protests spiked with outbreaks of looting rioting and arrests. Not long after Browns death his mother Lesley McSpadden wailed in the streets. His stepfather Louis Head found the composure to hold up a cardboard sign. ""Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son"" it read with three exclamation points. Police suggested that Brown was a suspect in a robbery and physically confronted the officer who tried to detain him. On Friday the police released a report identifying him as a suspect in a convenience store incident involving the theft of a box of Swisher Sweets cigars. The ensuing six days of unrest have escalated to the point where the police are launching canisters of tear gas seizing journalists and shooting protesters with rubber bullets. Browns shooting followed the death last month of Eric Garner of Staten Island. He died in a struggle with police officers who aimed to arrest him. The New York City medical examiner ruled the death a homicide which caused police supporters to cry politics. But even before that Al Sharpton long missing in sustained on-the-ground political action hopped down from his perch at MSNBC and into the streets to demand justice. A half-dozen New York congresspeople of color want the Justice Department to open a federal inquiry into whether law-enforcement practices unreasonably target blacks and Latinos. And earlier this week police in Los Angeles shot and killed Ezell Ford an unarmed 25-year-old whose family said he was living with ""mental problems."" This came after a widely circulated July 1 video in which Daniel L. Andrew a white California Highway Patrol officer could be seen straddled atop Marlene Pinnock a 51-year-old homeless black woman and punching her with a force that falls somewhere between Cartoon Network and UFC. In Chicago theres a separate epidemic of black-on-black shootings that sometimes involves the police. The president who has spent his annual vacation on Marthas Vineyard issuing statements about the assortment of deadly political fires burning around the world appeared Thursday before the press to address the latest log to hit the pyre. Standing in what appeared to be a school cafeteria he first offered a detailed update of the recent military operation in Iraq particularly concerning the current fate of the persecuted Yazidi people. It was surreally sobering to watch a world leader segue from militarized chaos in the Middle East to seemingly militarized chaos in St. Louis without having to adjust his tone. President Obama noted that the Justice Department is on the case then called for calm and transparency. Looting is inexcusable he said. Excessive force is too. He left the stage having taken no questions and leaving few lines to read between beyond making one humanitarian crisis seem an echo of another. To the extent that the equation was at all a conscious touch it was deft. Its possible that in the coming days or God forbid weeks the president could have something more specific to say about the freighted decades-long history of political imbalance at work in this case between a mostly black working-class town and its majority white government and police force. But this is a black man who must choose his words about race governance and law enforcement even more carefully than a white politician would. And this is the third summer in which as president he would have to do so. The first time came in 2009 after Sergeant James Crowley of the Cambridge Police Department arrested the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates on the porch of Gatess home. Obamas curt remarks and the ensuing apologetic ""beer summit"" among the sergeant the professor the president and the vice-president over mugs of Sam Adams Light Blue Moon and Bud Light (Veep sipped alcohol-free Buckler) was an event only The Onion could love. Obamas second attempt to address race and injustice came just over a year ago following the hand-wringing after George Zimmermans acquittal for the shooting of Trayvon Martin. The speech Obama gave worked largely because the president seemed to be making different conflations between himself as both a black formerly young male and as president of the United States and between black people who wanted him to say something and white people who needed to hear what hed say. Sadly most of what he said then could easily apply right now. Lets Be Cops has no comparable outrage on its mind. It has very little mind at all. What its got is Damon Wayans Jr. and Jake Johnson as Justin and Ryan friends and roommates from the Midwest who are stagnating in Los Angeles desperate not to be losers. Justin works at a gaming company. Ryan barely works at all. Not far into things Justin arrives at the apartment after his boss rejects his idea for an all-cops video game in favor of something like firefighters vs. zombies. The box Justin carries home contains a pair of police uniforms presumably for the presentation. But the roommates are due that evening at a college masquerade ball for which Ryan mistakenly presumes that costumes are required and cops are cooler than bed-sheet ghosts so cops it is. The party -- for Purdue in L.A. -- turns out to be just a stuffy soiree clogged with the sort of privileged white zombies the movies typically trot out for depictions of prep schools Princeton or almost any American movie about dystopia. Almost none of them seems to know or care about Justin and Ryan or their uniforms except as an opportunity to ask ""What happened to you?"" Ryan used to be a star quarterback; now hes the out-of-shape coach of little boys who cant stand him. The two leave the Purdue event dejected but on the streets still in costume strange things happen. Streams of (mostly white) girls run up and kiss them. When Justin and Ryan approach a group of adolescents getting high the kids turn terrified. Ryan takes a hit from their joint and its as though hes hit on the head in one of those amnesia movies. He believes hes a cop. The gag runs aground quickly. Justin and Ryan get mixed up in an in-progress hardware store robbery and an insulting domestic dispute between black sorority sisters that ends with Justin being slammed through a glass table. Mainly they try to bring down Ye Olde Ethnic Drug Cartel (Russians this time) with the help of an actual cop (Rob Riggle) whos charmed enough by Justin and Ryans stabs at competence to say stuff along the lines of ""You guys are crazy."" A humorless Andy Garcia is here. So is the goatee thats wearing him. And the head Russian goon (James DArcy)? Justin has just started dating the waitress (Nina Dobrev) at the restaurant thats the front for his operation. And shes gonna be so mad when she finds out hes not a cop Director and cowriter Luke Greenfield has lain other eggs the most rotten of them being the so-jealous-of-her-wedding comedy Something Borrowed. But he also produced the comedy Role Models which should have marked the beginning of Seann William Scott and Paul Rudds domination of the buddy comedy. This movie has neither Role Modelss writing nor its comedic zing. Wayans and Johnson share a television home on New Girl but they have the movie chemistry of two people whose previous movie would have been about an odd couple who learn to tolerate each other. There are some random funny bits -- featuring Keegan-Michael Key as a dreadlocked wildly inked cholo and Natasha Leggero as a stoned sexpot whose apartment the not-cops use to stake out the Russians. The movie just doesnt take this premise anywhere new or smart enough. Its an incompetent comedy hidden behind incompetence. The level of visual ugliness warrants a Jackass- or Sacha Baron Cohen-style social-prank approach. A lot of those random funny bits involve peoples reactions to having a police officer in their midst. Id watch a movie in which Wayans and Johnson tried that same gag on real civilians. It could get ugly but who knows. After Justin is dropped through that table the woman who does it looks down at him and says ""Thats what you get."" An unscripted version might also end with someone crashing through furniture but what youd get with that movie would seem worth it. This would just be more flushable summer waste (and please dont let me stop you from jiggling the handle) except Lets Be Cops somehow doubles as a fantasy that knows its social limits limits that connect it to the turmoil in Ferguson and those limits ease on down the road of race. The movie doesnt want to make a big deal about this but Justin is black and Ryan white which is newsworthy in that despite one guys annoyance with the other they appear to have been friends long enough for racial osmosis to set it. Justin speaks the way black comedians -- like Wayanss father Damon Sr. -- do when theyre impersonating an uptight white guy. Ryan occasionally twists and spikes the cadences of his speech so it sounds comedically black. Justin says ""dude"" a lot. Ryan likes ""bro."" Permeable racial identity becomes a kind of running gag especially once Key and his impersonation of a loopy Mexican gangsta shows up. The ethical tension firms up over whether to end the ruse. Justin repeatedly tries but over and over Ryan stops him or Justin stops himself because the spoils prove hard to resist. But the ecstasy of power never takes over black Justin the way it does white Ryan. The movies many assholes are put in their place and uniformed Ryan is the one who places them there. He throws the lingo around and gets mistaken for a sergeant. Being a cop empowers him. But it stresses Justin out. For one thing Justins name plate says ""Chang."" His awareness of other peoples awareness of race keeps barring him from settling into character. At some point these two wind up in a precinct and Justin takes the opportunity to turn himself in. Implausibly the attempt goes nowhere -- well implausibly this movie also makes it past the 15th minute. Still its striking how attuned to racial temperature the film is. Two of the little boys on Ryans football team -- Joey (Joshua Ormond) and Ron (Ron Caldwell) -- get a load of Ryan as a cop. Joeys white Rons black and until they see the uniform theyre both fed up with Ryans immaturity. But its Joey who joins Ryan on a stakeout. Youre free to wonder about the point-of-view options. Riggles officer has a black partner who bends over and sticks his head in the camera frame. Hes barely heard from again. Ron gets one other scene but its a telling one. Ryan shows up at the field and Ron gives him stink-eye. ""Hes a cop"" says Joey just as if he were Opie Taylor talking about Sheriff Andy. ""He aint shit"" says Ron with all of the contempt and wisdom he can muster. Its astonishing to hear a child so knowingly twist himself around three words. Who knows what was on anyones mind when this movie was being made? But inasmuch as realism exists in a dumb farce the whispers of race relative to the police resonate. American popular culture harbors the same richly mixed feelings about law enforcement (the heroism the villainy the foolishness) as it does about black men (rinse and repeat the previous aside). Occasionally the mixed feelings meet in the same film as they do with Sidney Poitiers three outings as Detective Virgil Tibbs and during a lot of the career of Denzel Washington whose highlights include explosive stints on both sides of the law. If youre a black actor in Hollywood youve probably played a cop. (Men like Yaphet Kotto and of all people Ice Cube barely play anything else.) Its a seemingly frictionless race-blind job that lets a black guy be the star without having to do a lot of explaining. (What? Hes a cop.) Often hes playing a detective on a case that involves white corruption and multinational intrigue not kids walking to their grandmothers house. In Bad Boys II Will Smith and Martin Lawrence take on the Ku Klux Klan but also Russian gangsters Haitian killing machines and Cuban drug lords and Lawrence spends the movie in a stress-induced nervous breakdown. Rarely do movies and television show officers of color doing police work in their own communities grappling with the personal psychological and social complexities of having to protect and serve people predisposed to distrust you. Danny Glovers Roger Murtaugh came under gang-banger attack in Lethal Weapon 3 but the movie had bigger whiter fish to fry. A movie like Training Day goes the extra mile having Washington turn into a monster who by his own queasy admission is bigger than King Kong. There are far more attempts to understand police on television and in the movies than there are attempts to empathize with black men whether or not those men happen to be cops. Its worth noting that the theme song of TVs longest-running glorification of a particular style of law enforcement Inner Circles ""Bad Boys"" has been infectiously misinterpreted as referring to the enforcers themselves. The enduring watchability of Cops which has been on television for a quarter of a century comes from the conflated appeal of power stupidity and justice nearly always at the expense of the poor often against black men and Latinos. But its also a show you watch to see where the line is and whether or how often the officers have crossed it. Once in a blue moon you get a film that leaves the necessary self-policing zone of blaxploitation which was in part devoted to black boots in black populations; you get a movie like Charles Burnetts The Glass Shield in which a black officer in the L.A. County Sheriffs Department stops and thinks about what it means to be part of a force going out of its way to persecute black men. The Wire committed itself to a quiet investigation of black law enforcement working in black neighborhoods. But hip-hop has gone for sophisticated if scandalous skepticism in the matter. Theres the conspiratorial narrative in KRS-Ones rat-smelling ""Black Cop"" which goes as far as to assert that black police officers are the sell-out pawns of a white police force. Police work hard as it is is a good job. But neither the guilt nor the satisfaction is what you feel from Damon Wayans Jr. In Lets Be Cops theres an allergic reaction to even pretending to understand what it takes to be a cop. On Friday morning the identity of the officer who shot Michael Brown was disclosed as Darren Wilson after a week of silence. Calls for the official release of the officers name were near the heart of the protests. The police chiefs persistent refusal to do so until today further infuriated residents. But the protection of the officers identity seems apt for clannish communities. Law enforcement is similarly aggravated by ""stop snitching"" campaigns in black neighborhoods. Until this point in the turmoil the absence of the crucial second face in the incident seemed to heighten the distance between police and the people they serve. It grants them both an anonymity and autonomy that matches the bizarre transformation in Ferguson and elsewhere of police into troops. The riot gear turns 2014 into a dot on a Jim Crow-era timeline. Since the officers name wasnt made public more immediately it should have seemed urgent for the police to lose the riot attire and take steps to minimize distrust to dispel the contagious assumption that silence equates racism. Meanwhile there is a new face of law enforcement on the scene. Late yesterday afternoon Missouris governor Jay Nixon put the highway patrol in command of policing in Ferguson. The captain in charge is Ron Johnson a bald goateed black man and Ferguson native who has taken the disarming step of walking among the protesters. Reports from the scene which all week garnered comparisons to events in Gaza and northern Iraq have observed a change in the emotional weather. A heat wave has broken. The question of course is what happens to community-cop relations once Captain Johnson and his officers exit. Nonetheless whenever I see masked and helmeted police in photographs and movies or on the street going after protesters I wonder as I did during a battle royal between peasants and cops in the summers class-war sleeper Snowpiercer ""Who are these hidden people?"" It crosses my mind anytime I see a helmet swing a nightstick at a skull. The movies especially dystopic science fiction have gotten really good at siccing human drones on human beings or just showcasing warfare as stacks and stacks of computer-generated menace. Ferguson demonstrates how good life has gotten at turning into science fiction. That collapse of the real and the morally unreal took place in last summers Fruitvale Station which dramatized the 2009 shooting of 22-year-old Oscar Grant on an Oakland train platform. It opened the weekend before the president made his remarks about Trayvon Martin and race and bears a subdued kernel of resemblance to the events happening now in Ferguson. What is so affecting isnt just that 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed when he was barely a man. Its other things as well. One was how many reports of the incident that first day mentioned that he was about to start college. Thats a rite thats universally emotional. But for a black male from a poor family the first day of college is a freighted day that usually requires the sacrifice of more than one person. Black people know the odds of getting to and graduating from college and that theyre low. That Brown seemed to be on the right path compounded the parental local and national outrage over his being wiped from it. Another is the effort to combat the momentary attempt to present Brown as a kind of thug. The galvanizing garment after Martins death in 2012 was the hoodie. George Zimmerman said it corroborated his suspicion of Martin. It remains a loaded aspect of black urban style. One of the resonant images in the wake of Martins death was of the Miami Heat gathered with the heads of its players lowered their faces obscured by hoods. This week 300 members of the student body at Howard University might have topped that when they gathered for a photo in which they held up their hands in a ""dont shoot"" pose. When a photo circulating of Brown flashing a sideways peace sign was loosely (and apparently erroneously) interpreted as a gang symbol young black Americans went to Twitter and pushed back posting compare-contrast split-screen photos of themselves under the hashtag IfTheyGunnedMeDown. In the image on the left the subjects are say at a firing range or flashing an approximation of a gang sign. In the image on the right theyre holding a saxophone a baby or a cat. The project was not unlike something out of the conceptual photography of Lorna Simpson or Glenn Ligons playful solemn journeys through black culture and identity. IfTheyGunnedMeDown was meant to correct and curb demeaning journalistic presumptuousness and reroute the narrative of Browns victimhood. But occasionally in a moment like this art happens. This was art. The intent of those photos crossed my mind as clean-cut Justin gets talked into infiltrating a gangster event while made up to look exactly like the drug dealer that Keegan-Michael Key plays. Justin looks miserable in that costume too. But it was interesting to think about which photo of him news organizations would run were he to die on the job that he was pretending to have. This summer happens to mark the 25th anniversary of the death of Radio Raheem in Spike Lees magnum opus Do the Right Thing. Radio is the big Brooklyn lug with the flattop haircut who hauls around a boom box that blasts only one song (""Fight the Power"") all over the movies Bed-Stuy neighborhood. He gets on the nerves of Sal the middle-aged Italian American who owns the pizzeria and perplexes the three older black guys who sit outside and shoot the shit. The Korean couple who own the bodega find him obnoxious (hes not not). Even the teenagers find Radio strange. On his right hand is a four-fingered ring that spells ""love."" The ring on the left hand spells ""hate."" Its basically the mirrored dichotomy of IfTheyGunnedMeDown. Radio steps up to the camera and boxes his way through an explanatory monologue. The movies racial pot has been simmering the entire film. After Sal and the neighborhood activist Buggin Out scream at each other Sal smashes Radios radio the pot boils over and the moral cubism of all the movies canted angles threatens to send all of the characters sliding into a racial abyss. Radio lunges at Sal and pulls him from behind his counter onto the floor and eventually outside where he chokes Sal until three white police officers pull him off and restrain him by securing a nightstick against his neck. The shot is framed just wide enough so that you can see the cops and Radio all struggling until the young black man with the flattop and finger rings ceases to struggle. Theres a cutaway to his sneakers which have been wriggling off the ground the entire altercation. One of the cops pleads for the officer with the nightstick to loosen his grip. But its too late. Radios breathing sputters then stops. He falls to the street his lifeless face in background his felled right hand at the center bottom of the screen Love. This fictional death the events that led up to it and the riot that ensued were devastating in 1989 the same year that introduced Cops. That theyve continued to find real-world corollaries in the decades since defies comprehension. Ferguson ought to be a freak occurrence at this point. But the unrest there is no such thing. Its yet another dispatch from the abyss.

"Lets Be Cops an appallingly bad buddy comedy review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLets Be Cops an appallingly bad buddy comedy review Lets Be Cops is as obnoxious as lead Jake Johnson playing a slacker who with his roommate gets his kicks from impersonating a police officer. Jake Johnson left as Ryan and Damon Wayans Jr. as Justin get a laugh from playing fake police officers in Lets Be Cops.  (Frank Masi / AP)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Aug. 14 2014Lets Be CopsStarring Jake Johnson Damon Wayans Jr. Co-written and directed by Luke Greenfield. 104 minutes. Now playing at GTA theatres. 14A.Lets hope there isnt a rash of police impersonation incidents following the release of Lets Be Cops.Lets hope (in vain no doubt) that this tasteless and obnoxious buddy comedy with an ill-conceived premise and a poorly written script takes a dive at the box office.Article Continued BelowLets not delve too deeply into why the film opens with the Backstreet Boys ""I Want It That Way"" or that none of the five members -- one of the leads reminds us -- never had a post-boy-band solo career like say Justin Timberlake of Nsync.Lets instead get right to the story of two roommates living in L.A. and going nowhere when Ryan (Jake Johnson) somehow procures two authentic police uniforms to use in a pitch for his pal Justins (Damon Wayans Jr.) latest video game idea.Lets overlook the fact that slacker Ryan with no visible means of support manages to then trick out an old police car bought on eBay with all the gadgetry needed for a working police car (except for some reason licence plates). Soon the two are trolling the mean streets where they encounter some Eastern European gangsters menacing a restaurant where Justins would-be girlfriend Josie (Nina Dobrev) works.Lets look at the actual chemistry between the two leads that so often makes buddy comedies work. Theres almost none since they dont riff off each other particularly well. Its almost like Johnson obnoxiously tedious in his portrayal of a former football star waylaid by an injury and Wayans Jr. whose comic styling involves a lot of hand gestures and facial twitching are in two different movies.(Lets not concern ourselves too deeply with why Ryan spends his days hanging out with postpubescent boys one of whom becomes embroiled in their adventures.)Lets consider why a fine actor like Andy Garcia shows up briefly as villainous turncoat Detective Brolin -- alimony unpaid taxes addiction issues. The other main villain Mossi (James DArcy) is simply not menacing.Lets be grateful that the gross-out humour is kept to a relative minimum though the scene in which an overweight naked perps testicles come perilously close to Justins face during a takedown is appallingly memorable in the worst way.Lets overlook the fact that the films distributors refused to offer an advance screening for movie critics. They know and we know that the film is going to be poorly reviewed.Finally lets earnestly hope there is no sequel.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Frank Masi SMPSP/Twentieth Century Fox) By Ann Hornaday August 14 2014 Follow AnnHornaday Like a down-market ""Sharknado"" of buddy-policemen movies ""Lets Be Cops"" seeks to capitalize on the success of the ""21 Jump Street"" franchise with lackadaisically exploitative relish Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. play a couple of 30-year-old washed-ups living in Los Angeles who for reasons far too convoluted and tiresome to go into here possess two perfectly fitting LAPD uniforms. Walking home from the party they wear them to they find that theyre getting female attention and respect for the first time since college a frisson of self-worth that leads Ryan (Johnson) a former football hero to take the impersonation as far as he possibly can. Ryans best friend Justin (Wayans) is more reticent but he keeps up the ruse partly to impress a pretty waitress played by Nina Dobrev. Director and co-writer Luke Greenfield brings no flair or energy to a flimsy premise that like a piece of gum hes found on his shoe only grows thinner and more annoying the longer he tries to stretch it out. Worse he fails to capitalize on the chemistry between Johnson and Wayans who have proven their mutually supportive mojo on the sitcom ""New Girl."" ""Lets Be Cops"" is the kind of movie that depends for laughs on tired bits involving kids swearing and sustains the audiences interest with frequent excuses to ogle shapely women dancing provocatively in bars at parties or in one unsavory instance on her own skankily disheveled couch. Johnson and Wayans are both gifted comic performers but are given way too little to do in a film that wends its way from set piece to set piece not with antic glee but desultory and-then-this-happens randomness. Things begin to look up when Rob Riggle arrives on the scene looking like he just popped in from his hilarious cameo in ""The Hangover."" But like the two leads Riggle is quickly sucked into the ""Lets Be Cops"" vortex of lazy plotting and uninspired workmanlike execution. His first scene with the guys involves a hardware store break-in conducted for no apparent reason other than to set up a cheap gross-out gag by a nearly naked sumo wrestler. After several protracted sequences featuring a slithery villain (James DArcy) and a tattooed gold-grilled contraband runner (Keegan-Michael Key) ""Lets Be Cops"" turns deadly serious for its final half-hour with Ryan and Justin confronting real-life crime corruption and gun violence and the filmmakers making an unconvincing point about the difference between video-game mayhem and the real thing. Theres nothing real about ""Lets Be Cops"" which if theres any justice in the world should earn its perpetrators a healthy stretch in movie jail. 1 of 99 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x What not to watch View Photos A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics.

Best friends and roommates Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) and Ryan (Jake Johnson) learn that the hard way but not without finding some joy in the fantasy that you can become the success you had always hoped to by just slipping on some aviators and buying a police car off eBay. Easy is the theme and reality of Lets Be Cops. As the pair slides into fake lives and real danger the movie glides on the formula of buddy cop films putting on those tropes just like Justin and Ryan putting on cop gear. As a film Lets Be Cops glides in the same way its characters do. Though it charms its difficult to ignore how many times weve seen this story played out before. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - At 30 the friends are Midwesterners struggling to find success in Los Angeles. Ryan is the Deadbeat Loser still living off the money he made from a herpes commercial two years ago and playing football with preteens to relieve the pain of never making it to the NFL. Justin is the Weak Loser an assistant at a video game company who is infantilized by his douche bag boss and unable to sell his video game idea aptly titled Patrolman. In keeping with the trend of awful life choices they mistake a college reunion masquerade for a midsummer costume party and come dressed in the Patrolman costumes Justin happens to have lying around their apartment. Once they walk down the street with their badges shining and (unloaded) guns holstered this dejected pair feels like superheroes suddenly able to control pedestrians with a flick of the hand -- and better still get revenge on the mobsters who had hit their hoopty the night before. (That squad is led by James DArcy looking like rapper Riff Raff without the cornrows and gold teeth.)Like the video games Justin designs and the college football stardom Ryan refuses to abandon the fantasy becomes a shield from the realities of their inadequacies. They bring to life everything theyve learned from cop movies where the heroes yell cool shit like ""Yippee-ki-yay"" and always get the girl. After 22 Jump Street ripped to shreds the formula of a buddy cop film its difficult to not side-eye the perfect mold Lets Be Cops casts itself in. Per usual an odd couple struggles to mesh together as a team find their bearings encounter dangers have a falling-out then transform into heroes saving the day and one another. The familiarity proves a distraction. Will anyone be surprised when the tone shifts from a losers dreamworld of living in an action movie to an actual action movie?Film Details Lets Be Cops RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time104 More Info Trailer It doesnt help that the film falls victim to the same gay and race jokes that goofball bromances have such a hard time shaking. The shots are cheap and usually taken by Wayans as Justin at himself who is -- surprise -- portrayed as having some effeminate qualities. Early on he punches Ryan for ""sneaking up on a brother."" Later love interest Josie (Nina Dobrev) notes that Justins ""limp wrist"" might be why hes reluctant to commit. Self-deprecation is a little unnecessary when the films premise is two dudes failing so hard in their lives that they become fake police officers.As always the genre depends upon consistency. Though both Wayans and Johnson are rehashing some nuances of their New Girl buds in the characterizations of Justin and Ryan the pair works well with and off one another. They weave in and out of being one anothers straight man and are equally agile at both. Its comforting watching the prime-time friends together in the blockbuster but it was disappointing to see any edginess the comfortable chemistry allowed room for not taken advantage of. Rob Riggle continuing his streak as comedy film cops offers the biggest surprise nailing the role of an action hero-type character distinguished by slick coolness. (After playing so many joke cops he was due) Keegan Michael-Key with Lil Wayne dreads and face tattoos is wonderful as the key to unlocking what the mobsters are smuggling. He offers the biggest laughs alongside Johnsons running gag of self-promoting his fake cop from officer to sergeant to detective.A loser in a uniform is still a loser and a stock buddy cop film starring a popular pair of sitcom stars is still a stock buddy cop film. Where movies like The Heat or even 21 Jump Street make the formula feel like new Lets Be Cops and its meta-fantasy of the way games and films inform our idea of excitement comes off as watered down. Though the film has some charm its just like any of us who pretends to be something were not You can only fool everyone else for so long.

Bad timing cant be held against a film though. People loved The Heat last year but would the sight of Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy dropping a black man off a balcony register as many yuks this week? Should it? At the same time Lets Be Cops is actually about the power that two ordinary schmoes discover after dressing up as cops for a college reunion. (They think its a costume party; its actually a masked ball. You have to have some respect for a movie whose subtlest weirdest joke winds up being its very premise.) Ryan (Jake Johnson) is a has-been football star and former actor who spends his spare time overzealously playing with young kids in the park; Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) is a milquetoast game developer who gets regularly pushed around by his co-workers. As no-name schlubs prowling around glitz-obsessed Los Angeles theyre barely noticed by the girls they like and easily harassed by black-clad Russian douchebags in slick SUVs. Once they don the uniform though and spend a night pretending to be in law enforcement their world changes. These men of no respect suddenly find themselves men of consequence. They tell a skateboarder to stop and he comes to a sudden stop and goes flying off his board. They get into the best clubs. They confiscate random kids weed. Bridal-shower parties jump them kiss them dry-hump them and make them strip. A Its like one of those supernatural comedies from the 1990s where Jim Carrey would discover he suddenly had some superpower. Theyre intoxicated by their newfound abilities. At least one of them is After their one night as fake cops Ryan brushes up on his police lingo and tactics off YouTube buys a Crown Victoria on eBay and convinces Justin to go along with him on a full-on fake patrol. They wind up getting more than they bargained for -- because apparently it didnt occur to them that if you dress up as a cop and respond to actual 911 calls some crazy shit might happen. Devoid of context Lets Be Cops is mildly amusing stuff. Director Luke Greenfield is one of those comedy journeymen who makes low-rent efforts that often wind up better than they have to be. (The Animal and The Girl Next Door come to mind.) He has a flair for shooting physical humor While most comedy directors cut quickly to keep things moving or to patch together bits of improv one-upmanship he gives his performers plenty of room to contort themselves or to try weird bits of slapstick. (A bizarre turn by Natasha Leggero playing the drunk horny tenant of an apartment Ryan and Justin use for a stakeout might be the funniest bit here.) The film does occasionally threaten to come to life whenever it becomes about the power trip of authority. After Rob Riggle shows up as an actual cop who befriends our heroes and spends time goofing around with them you could be forgiven for thinking the film will start to go in a more touchy provocative direction. But no It pulls back steering clear of anything that might be interesting or uncomfortable. Why? Because duh its a movie called Lets Be Cops starring Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans and directed by the guy who made The Animal. Did I really want Lets Be Cops to go in a genuinely provocative direction to try for more troubling bits of ""edgy"" humor or satire? Im not sure. It could be said that such things are no laughing matter and that a film designed for easy laughs shouldnt go there. Its probably true. Soon enough the uncomfortable real-life resonances will fade away and well remember this movie mostly as a ... agh who am I kidding? We wont remember this movie at all. Lets Be Cops has its moments but it in no way distinguishes itself.

These newly minted ""heroes"" get tangled in a web of detectives that leads them to put their fake badges on the line. 20th Century Fox Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 905 a.m. MST August 14 2014Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. play two down-on-their-luck guys who pretend to be cops. It could be funny but director Luke Greenfield too often takes the easy predictable way out.Damon Wayans Jr. and Jake Johnson star in a scene from ""Lets Be Cops.""(Photo 20th Century Fox)Story HighlightsCritics review 2 starsDirector Luke Greenfield too often takes the easy predictable way out.The best parts of the movie are when Jake Johnson gives Ryan an unhinged quality.Yay stupidThat could be the motto of the people behind ""Lets Be Cops"" a ridiculous comedy whose greatest sin is one of omission a lack of humor. And thats a hard one to forgive.Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. play Ryan and Justin a couple of guys who at 30 are dangerously close to not making it in LA which was their plan. Justin is a wimpy video-game designer whose pitch for a game in which the player is a cop gets overrun by his bullying boss (Jonathan Lajoie). Justin is busted down to note taker.At least he has a job. Ryan once was an NFL-bound quarterback for Purdue University but injuries cut his career short. Now in a rather creepy development he hangs around kids at the park trying to convince himself that hes their coach and teaching them to play football the right way. (This involves running over them and cursing.)AZCENTRALSomething for everyone 52 Fall films for 2014One night the LA alumni group invites them to a costume party; they use the uniforms Justin got for his video-game presentation and go as policemen. Only its not a costume party its a masquerade party. A few ego-bruising scenes later the less-than-dynamic duo is walking to the car talking about hanging up their LA dreams.And then they notice something funny Women look at them. Men respect them. Men obey them. All because theyre wearing the uniform of the LAPD.So at Ryans insistence they continue wearing the uniforms. Ryan becomes especially enthusiastic; in a non-movie world this would be known as ""delusional."" Possibly ""psychopathic."" In any world even this one its known as ""absurd."" And perhaps ""inevitable.""Justin is more uncomfortable particularly after he looks up the statutes regarding impersonating a police officer but he goes along with it once he sees the effect the uniform has on Josie (Nina Dobrev) the waitress and aspiring makeup artist he has always been too shy to ask out.AZCENTRALAll the reviews Weekend movie guide for PhoenixSo far so stupid but harmless enough. But director and co-writer Luke Greenfield introduces a mob story that even by silly buddy-(fake) cop movies is ridiculous. Mossi (James DArcy) is a psychopathic killer who of course crosses the paths of Justin and Ryan. Naturally Justin and Ryan will be called upon to use all their pretend-police skills to bring Mossi down. They enlist the help of brave-but-dumb real police officer Segars (Rob Riggle) who cant quite figure out that his new friends are faking -- even after they tell him.There are some laughs here but not many. Johnson and Wayans have a pleasant enough chemistry but the best parts of the movie are when Johnson gives Ryan an unhinged quality. The guy has been down so long he doesnt care how dangerous maintaining his new identity is.A scene in which Ryan interacts with the sexually voracious (and almost certainly depraved) woman (Natasha Leggero) whose apartment he and Justin borrow for surveillance gives a hint of how funny the movie might have been. Its weird and its good.Alas Greenfield more often opts for the easy way out making ""Lets Be Cops"" much more predictable than it is funny.Review Lets Be Cops 2 starsDirector Luke Greenfield.Cast Jake Johnson Damon Wayans Jr.RatingR for language including sexual references some graphic nudity violence and drug use.AZCENTRALLets Be Cops (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Photo Twentieth Century Fox MOVIE REVIEW Lets Be Cops Running time 104 minutes. Rated R (violence drugs graphic male nudity). At the Harlem USA the Battery Park City others. The only truly lethal weapons in the criminally unfunny action comedy ""Lets Be Cops are the lame script putrid direction and pair of sitcom stars mugging nonstop in frantic pursuit of laughs that have fled over the state line. ""New Girl"" costars Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. play a couple of 30-year-old nitwits who discover strangers respond to their LA cop masquerade costumes so they decide to play cops for fun. Johnsons character is an unemployed actor and former football star for Purdue University -- which ought to sue for defamation -- while Wayans plays a video game designer. Somehow their highly inexpert ruse fools even a veteran police officer (Rob Riggle) who becomes their ally. The ""New Girl"" co-stars attempt to bring their small screen charm to this buddy-cop comedy.Photo Twentieth Century Fox Johnson the more gung-ho of the two gets so into his masquerade that he even buys an LAPD cruiser on eBay to impress the ladies (though how he pays for it is never explained). Unfortunately the guys also attract the attention of a generically European mobster (James DArcy) whos in league with a corrupt police detective (Andy Garcia who must really need the money). This is the throw-it-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks school of comedy. Unfortunately nothing sticks during the way-too-long running time which is punctuated by tired drug gags periodic gun battles to keep the audience awake -- and that charmingly homophobic testicles-in-the-face routine. Even when the writers somehow stumble into a promising situation -- a shoot-out in the conference room of Wayans video-game employer -- director Luke Greenfield (whose rap sheet includes ""The Animal) has no idea of how to stage it to actually get laughs.

TWITTER Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. play two underachievers who decide to pose as L.A. policemen At one point during Lets Be Cops actor Damon Wayans Jr. has a scene in which a huge naked mans testicles are dangling inches in front of his face. Thats a good approximation of what filmgoers will experience during this witless high-concept comedy featuring him and his co-star on Fox sitcom New Girl Jake Johnson who must be newly appreciating the sophistication of the small screen. In case you didnt deduce it from the title the film concerns two stumblebums who decide to impersonate policemen for kicks. They are 30-year-olds Ryan (Johnson) a former college gridiron star and mostly unemployed actor who spends his time barging in on childrens football games and Justin (Wayans) a struggling video game designer. When the pair don police uniforms borrowed from Justins failed attempt at pitching a cop-themed video game to attend a masquerade party that they mistakenly assume is a costume party they find themselves the recipients of adoring female attention and respectful deference from everyone with whom they come into contact. Since the film is set in Los Angeles thats the first clue that nothing onscreen will be remotely believable. The pair are soon engaged in various hijinks that escalate when Ryan buys a used police car on eBay and outfits it with the literal bells and whistles. Although the milquetoast Justin is initially resistant to the charade he enthusiastically joins in after finally getting somewhere with Josie (Nina Dobrev) the beautiful coffee shop waitress for whom hes been pining. They eventually run afoul of a gang of Russian mobsters headed by the psychopathically violent Mossi (a buffed-up James DArcy). With the aid of a real cop (Rob Riggle) who at first mistakes them for the real thing they get embroiled in a dangerous investigation in which theyre way over their heads. The screenplay co-written by Nicholas Thomas and director Luke Greenfield fails to mine the potentially humorous premise for the necessary laughs with nearly all of the gags falling thuddingly flat. As if realizing that the humor wasnt going anywhere the film suddenly lurches into action movie territory complete with the sort of violence and brutality that is tonally at odds with the farcical setup. While they demonstrate a genuine onscreen chemistry the lead performers are thoroughly adrift with Wayans mainly displaying pained expressions throughout and Johnson devolving into unfunny boorish mode. The supporting players are equally ineffective at overcoming the lame material with Andy Garcia barely making an impression (but picking up an easy paycheck) as an underworld heavy. The sole exception is Keegan-Michael Key of the sketch comedy duo Key amp; Peele who garners some laughs as a wildly braided street informant. The end credits are accompanied not by the usual outtakes but rather by brief comic scenes that didnt make into the final product. Perversely theyre funnier than anything thats preceded them.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Three seasons in Foxs New Girl remains one of the most consistently satisfying sitcoms on television--a screwball party of a show a weekly hangout session with a bunch of endearingly insecure knuckleheads. The humor is less situational than conversational These mismatched roomies seem more like friends than the Friends ever did and the series peaks when it simply throws them all into a single setting where they can bounce their issues off of each other. A similar spirit of dysfunctional camaraderie pervades the slapdash buddy comedy Lets Be Cops which stars two New Girl cast members Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. as roommates who begin masquerading as Los Angeles police officers. Dont be fooled by the high concept The film very much conforms to the loose comedic style of its leads its jokes often amounting to little more than the two actors bickering like school children and having embarrassingly public slap fights.Should they ignore certain details like character names and occupations New Girl fans might even be able to pretend theyre watching the pilot for some Nick Miller and Coach spin-off series. Years after an injury cost him his athletic career former college running back Ryan (Johnson) lives off the royalties of an STD commercial. His longtime roomie Justin (Wayans) is doing only a little better; hes the low man on the totem pole at a video-game company pitching a hyper-real police simulation to his indifferent superiors. The two hit rock bottom when they confuse the masquerade theme of their college reunion for a costume-party theme showing up dressed in LAPD uniforms. But when strangers on the street mistake them for real cops--women throwing themselves at them men bowing to their false authority--the two embrace the lie Ryan going as far as buying a cruiser on eBay and ""promoting"" himself to sergeant. The trouble begins when these fake officers get on the bad side of a psychotic short-tempered crime lord (James DArcy).On paper Lets Be Cops must have read like a project too dumb even for Seth Rogen or Jonah Hill. Director and cowriter Luke Greenfield--no relation presumably to New Girl costar Max Greenfield--often panders to the lowest common denominator packing his film with ouch-my-balls slapstick the usual tiresome gay-panic gags and indifferently shot gun fights. (The shoot-em-up finale will make discerning action-comedy buffs long for the parodic craftsmanship of Hot Fuzz.) Theres also a completely disposable love story between Justin and a budding makeup artist (Nina Dobrev who has absolutely zero chemistry with Wayans) and lots of boring talk of self-actualization and manning up.All of this would be more fatal if Lets Be Cops didnt operate almost exclusively as a showcase for the inspired rapport of its stars. Tweaking their small-screen routines only slightly the two settle into a familiar but likable live-wire/straight-man dynamic. Wayans does the exasperated-partner act well while still getting to cut loose during a scene of his character tripping out on crystal meth. And Johnson whos never funnier than when erupting into laughter himself marries the man-child affability of Nick Miller to a more destructive streak of juvenile mischief. At times the movie seems to exist for no other purpose than to collide these two personalities together privileging their antagonistic banter above all else. But isnt that the basic point of all buddy comedies?

"Lets Be Cops wastes a sharp comic premise - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Lets Be Cops wastes a sharp comic premise Lets Be Cops Frank Masi / Twentieth Century Fox Film Actors Jake Johnson and actor Damon Wayans Jr. in ""Lets Be Cops."" Actors Jake Johnson and actor Damon Wayans Jr. in ""Lets Be Cops."" (Frank Masi / Twentieth Century Fox Film) Robert Abele Lets Be Cops with Damon Wayans Jr. and Jake Johnson is not funny Theres an appealing hint of misadventure in a title like ""Lets Be Cops"" as well as in the first few scenes in which down-on-their-luck roommates Ryan (Jake Johnson) a failed football player and Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) a video game designer realize the power rush of impersonating authority.After the humiliation of mistakenly wearing costumes to a snooty mask party they mope along the Sunset Strip until they realize the demeanor of everyone around them changes Strangers move out of the way party girls treat them as hot guys in uniform and ""Freeze"" becomes a magical time-stopper. They even agree to be fake fake cops for a group of middle-aged women who take them to be strippers. Like any sharp comic premise the promising tang of something anarchically amusing is in the air which makes the rote slipshod and unfunny rest of the movie all the more dispiriting -- like a drug thats as much fun as precinct paperwork.""Lets Be Cops"" is its own movie in disguise a role-playing romp thats actually a generic buddy-cop movie. Director Luke Greenfield and his co-writer Nicholas Thomas saddle their newly transgressive bros with an uninspired heroes-and-villains story involving Russian gangsters threatening immigrant cafe owners and the pretty waitress (Nina Dobrev) who becomes Justins new girlfriend. When Andy Garcia shows up as the criminal overlord you know hes not supposed to be funny. Thats not a good sign. Even the shoehorning in of an emotional trajectory for Ryan and Justin -- Ryans found a career calling Justin learns to be assertive -- feels like something out of a recruitment video for the police force rather than a rascally comedy dismantling the culture of police from within. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles How it broke the remake curse Steven Zeitchik ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" didnt shatter the creative mold this weekend but it did break a streak and a rather inauspicious one at that--the trend for remakes of properties from the 1980s and early 90s flubbing at the box office.""Turtles"" which was panned by most critics and eye-rolled...

(Steven Zeitchik) Johnson and Wayans are likable enough. They have a rapport from their work together on the sitcom ""New Girl"" that they readily take advantage of here. But the movie relies too much on the same comic tension in each scene Johnson is the gung-ho one Wayans says no (a lot).Theres a slight spark when Keegan-Michael Key shows up as a dreadlocked Dominican henchman but elsewhere the movies reliance on dull improvisational exchanges over true comedic ingenuity grows tiresome. Even the raunch feels stale with a naked sweaty fat man bit that assumes ""Borat"" was a lifetime ago. Is August no longer filled with Hollywoods dog days? Josh Rottenberg T.S.

This alleged comedy takes a long time before it gets its first laugh in. The first half is a complete slog and the ending is insulting but there are a few semi-arresting sketch comedy moments. Ryan (Jake Johnson of TVs ""New Girl"") and Justin (Damon Wayans Jr. also on ""New Girl"") are a pair of L.A. dimwits who cant catch a break. Ryan still lives in the shadow of his high school football days; Justin is an insecure wannabe video game creator. After they leave a college reunion costume party in disgrace they discover that when theyre dressed as the police people -- especially ladies -- start treating them differently. Phony cops Justin (Damon Wayans Jr. left) and Ryan (Jake Johnson) react to the predicament of their new colleague Pupa (Keegan-Michael Key). (Frank Masi SMPSP) First as a goof then as some sort of revenge against society Ryan and Justin run around enjoying the unearned respect they get from fake badges and guns. The movie starts to hum during sequences at clubs and on lighthearted domestic calls but it quickly gets weighed down and ultimately sinks when an Albanian mob scheme pop up. Ryan (Jake Johnson center) makes an emphatic point to Segars (Rob Riggle left) as Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) looks on in Lets Be Cops. (Frank Masi SMPSP) The movies at its best giving its characters room for shtick. Straight-laced Wayans forced to take a hit of crystal meth and Keegan-Michael Key as a thuggish rasta are highlights that cut through the boring plot and overbearing final act of hokey redemption. But these moments are not enough to merit chasing down a ticket. Theres also the issue of bad timing. Its impossible to watch ""Lets Be Cops"" and its jokes about abuse of police power while the nation is dealing with recent events in Staten Island and Ferguson Mo. A different movie -- not a comedy -- could analyze Americas obsession with gun culture violent videogames and authority. Thats not the movie ""Cops"" director Luke Greenfield wanted to make however so these serious themes just lurk behind the attempted laughs. jneumaiernydailynews.com On a mobile device?

A mild chuckle every five minutes or so doesnt justify the predictable slog of this mistaken-identity farce. If nothing else its an object example of the importance of writing. The cast is loaded with people who have been hilarious elsewhere -- Damon Wayans Jr. (of the brilliant gone-too-soon ""Happy Endings"") Jake Johnson (""Drinking Buddies"") Rob Riggle (""NTSFSDSUV"") and Keegan-Michael Key (""Key amp; Peele"") to name just a few -- but the script by Nicholas Thomas and director Luke Greenfield (""Something Borrowed"") mires the performers in stale situations flat characters and setups that almost never pay off in a satisfying way. See video Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. Discover the Dangerous Side of Dress-Up in Latest Lets Be Cops Trailer (Video) The premise is simple but full of unfulfilled potential Would-be video game designer Justin (Wayans) and layabout ex-jock Ryan (Johnson) have made it to 30 without becoming successful in Los Angeles. Just when theyre about to go home to Ohio they attend an alumni costume party wearing the police uniforms that were part of Justins unsuccessful presentation for a first-person shooter game. (Sidenote The movie pulls the cobweb-covered ""We thought it was a costume party"" gag in the first five minutes never a promising indication of whats to come.) Walking home the two discover that the uniforms empower them making them respected feared and even adored by passers-by. Ryan gets so into his new fake identity that he starts watching YouTube clips about police terminology and methodology and he even buys an old squad car off eBay. Justin is reluctant at first until he realizes that his guise as ""Officer Chang"" attracts the attention of pretty waitress Josie (Nina Dobrev ""The Vampire Diaries"") who has aspirations of becoming a creature-effects makeup artist. (Second sidenote Because of the incongruous ID badge on his uniform Wayans cop persona would ostensibly be ""Justin Chang"" who happens to be a well-known film critic. Coincidence?) Because Los Angeles apparently has only eight or so people in it Ryan and Justin take advantage of their faux-police personae to mess with some Russian thugs who damaged Ryans car only to discover that the mobsters ringleader Mossi (James DArcy ""Cloud Atlas"") is a serious psycho who has been both harassing Josies bosses and stalking the waitress himself. Their buddy-cop shtick is enough to temporarily fool real policeman Segars (Riggle) but when the duo stumble upon a major conspiracy involving the Russians theyll need help from the actual LAPD to survive. Also read Lets Be Cops Looks Like Summers Next R-Rated Comedy Hit So...funny on paper right? And to be fair ""Lets Be Cops"" inspires the occasional laugh out of Ryans gung-ho-ness or Justins hesitancy. (Wayans reworks some of the hetero-fey body language that served him so well on ""Happy Endings."") It doesnt help that you can guess whats going to happen and which lessons are going to be learned. Meanwhile the script works up a froth to keep the story afloat. Long after Ryan and Justins ruse should have been exposed the film contorts itself to keep it going which would be forgivable if keeping doing so meant more laughs. Also read Why Hollywood Is Making Bank on Cut-Rate Comedies Cinematographer Daryn Okada (""Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay"") may be commenting on old-school TV police dramas with the flat bright look of the film but that doesnt make it any easier on the eyes. And anyone whos lived in Atlanta or Los Angeles will be able to distinguish which exteriors are which even though the entire film is supposedly set in the greater Hollywood area. With a combination of jokes that dont land and a constant flurry of exposition and plotting to keep these flimsy plates spinning ""Lets Be Cops"" more often than not feels more like a court-ordered defensive-driving class than a rousing high-speed chase.

"Lets Be Cops Review Luke Greenfields Funny-Enough Farce | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Lets Be Cops Joe Leydon Film Critic joeleydon 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr August 13 2014 | 0823AM PT The mix of funny business and rough stuff isnt always smooth but the target audience likely will be amused. The mix of raucous buffoonery and violent mayhem isnt exactly seamless and the laugh-out-loud moments come with conspicuously less frequency during a third act that suggests a rough draft for ""Bad Boys 3."" Still ""Lets Be Cops"" should generate solid late-summer box office if only because of trailers and TV spots that smartly exploit the sporadically hilarious funny business in helmer Luke Greenfields farce about underachievers who boost their self-esteem by pretending to be LAPD patrolmen. Relatively restrained by the contemporary standards of R-rated raunch the film could conceivably reach beyond its young-male target demographic during theatrical play and homescreen afterlife. Employing a premise that was played far more seriously in Canadian filmmaker David Wellingtons 1993 feature ""I Love a Man in Uniform"" Greenfield and co-scripter Nicholas Thomas briskly establish the discontent of their two leads in the opening scenes. Ryan (Jake Johnson of TVs ""New Girl"") a former college football player who was sidetracked by injuries on his way to the NFL feeds his bruised ego by coaching neighborhood kids - whether they want to be coached or not -- when he isnt half-heartedly pursuing a less-than-successful acting career. (His only major credit a weirdly upbeat commercial for herpes medication.) Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) Ryans best buddy and roommate is eager to make his mark as a videogame designer. But he slinks away in humiliation after co-workers and a snotty supervisor brutally shoot down his pitch for a new shooter game featuring L.A. cops. (His supervisor is more interested in zombies superheroes and firefighters though not necessarily in that order.) Justin just happens to obtain authentic-looking police uniforms for the purposes of his pitch and Ryan just happens to get the idea to don those uniforms for a college reunion he believes mistakenly is a costume party. The bad news The buddies are made painfully aware of their 30-year-old-loser status while mingling with their much more successful former classmates. The good news After the party the friends discover that walking around L.A. -- played throughout most of the movie in a bold stroke of casting by Atlanta -- is a great way to get respect. And not incidentally attract women. Ryan gets carried away with the thrill of their masquerade and proceeds to up the ante -- acquiring a decommissioned cop car on eBay purchasing bullet-proof vests etc. -- much to Justins increasing discomfort. Mind you Justin is quite happy to win the attention of Josie (Nina Dobrev) a beautiful waitress who wants to be a Hollywood makeup artist with his imposture as a patrolman. But Ryan insists on throwing himself and his buddy into dangerous situations -- including progressively edgier encounters with a Eurotrash mobster (James DArcy) and his crew -- without backup by real cops or even access to real guns. Johnson is unafraid to emphasize the more obnoxious aspects of his character even while obviously straining with frequent success to elicit hearty guffaws with Ryans bad behavior. The faux flatfoot isnt always likable to a large degree because while ""Lets Be Cops"" is a comedy the audience is never unaware that Ryan is repeatedly and stupidly placing himself and his buddy in mortal danger. Still Johnson always manages to retain some degree of sympathy especially when Ryans fecklessness is contrasted with the effectively straight-faced villainy of DArcys crime boss. Wayans gets the lions share of the physical-comedy action -- and the aptly anxious reactions -- and makes the most of the movies funniest scene in which Justin goes undercover as a thug tricked out with tattoos dreadlocks and shiny grill and must cope with the aftereffects of sampling crystal meth. ""Lets Be Cops"" features scads of supporting players overplaying in broadly comic roles -- Keegan-Michael Key is a standout as the English-mangling thug who inspires Justins undercover role playing -- but Greenfield relies on the more restrained performances by DArcy and Rob Riggle (well cast as a real cop who proves to be an invaluable ally for the leads) to enhance the sense of threat that percolates beneath the zaniness. Andy Garcia also helps in that regard but it would require spoiling one of the films few surprises to be more specific. There are wink-wink nod-nod references to various dead-serious (and not so serious) cops-and-killers thrillers including an inspired allusion to of all things ""Reservoir Dogs."" And even though some of the gags are brazenly non-P.C. the filmmakers are careful not to mine Justins use of a Chinese surname while play-acting for offensive ethnic humor. Indeed when Justin takes his one and only crack at a comical Chinese accent he immediately apologizes. No kidding. Tech values are slick and the many pop tunes on the soundtrack have been chosen with savvy. Be forewarned After this movie and ""This Is the End"" it appears possible the Backstreet Boys are poised for a comeback.
