Georges and Anne are in their eighties. One day Anne has an attack and the couples bond of love is severely tested. (Photo/Video Sony) By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 20 2012 716 p.m. ET Most films these days mimic the furious pace of our lives; they hurtle along from start to finish seldom pausing to breathe. Michael Hanekes French-language ""Amour"" a perfect film about intertwined lives proceeds at its own pace and breathes so deeply that it takes your own breath away. The setting is a comfortable Parisian apartment probably stylish in its day but showing its age where Georges and Anne a husband and wife played by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva share a life of quiet pleasures and comforting routines. Theyre retired music teachers in their 80s and the apartment is their untroubled world until one morning at breakfast Anne disappears. Shes there physically but what proves to be a transient stroke removes her and then a few moments later returns her seemingly intact. ""Amour"" is about the love that binds these two wonderful people and about sustaining that love in the shadow of death. Mr. Hanekes film exquisitely photographed by Darius Khondji has won all sorts of prizes all over the world and no wonder; the performances alone set it off as a welcoming masterpiece. ( Isabelle Huppert is fine as the couples high-strung daughter.) Since Annes condition worsens at first slowly and then anguishingly the more dramatic of the two roles is Ms. Rivas. This extraordinary artist who made her feature debut 53 years ago in another movie with love in the title ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" is as unsparing as her director in depicting Annes decline though physical insults and the erosion of identity are only part of the story. Moments of happiness still occur. Revisiting her past through a photo album Anne smiles an ineffably poignant smile and says ""Its beautiful life."" Mr. Trintignant a popular star of French films in the 1960s and 70s achieves in his role a ruefully calm transcendence. Georges may be a bit forgetful and somewhat rickety on his feet but hes in full possession of his senses from start to finish which is both a blessing and an undeserved curse. He cant really cope with the physical demands of caring for his wife though he does his very good best before hes tested beyond endurance. And he cant slow the course of her decline so he slows the passage of what time remains to them with stories--luminous stories of his life and theirs stories with an undercurrent of heartbreak and horror. To watch Mr. Trintignant in these moments and to hear the subtle modulations of his spoken words into a kind of dulcet music is to witness great acting stripped to the emotional bone. Georges is not just a paragon of love and devotion but of tenacity pride shocking anger and possessiveness often all at the same instant; Anne is his to care for and no one elses in the apartment that threatens to become a tomb. ""Amour"" might seem hardly the stuff of entertainment yet the reason it has been acclaimed isnt mysterious. Confronting death it studies life closely and lovingly. One of the stories that Georges tells Anne is about his childhood but its also not incidentally about movies--about his seeing a movie as a child and then shortly afterward not being able to recall the story only the feelings it evoked. From the beginning of our lives to the end this movie says feelings are all that matter. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Watch a clip from the film ""Jack Reacher"" starring Tom Cruise Richard Jenkins David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike. A homicide investigator digs deeper into a case involving a military sniper who shot five random victims. (Photo/Video Paramount) Jack Reacher Would ""Jack Reacher"" have been as loathsome if it had been released before the shootings at Sandy Hook elementary school? Surely not. A couple of weeks ago it might have been seen as just another dumb thriller in which a shooter with an assault rifle kills helpless victims in a public space. This week its a corporate disgrace. Paramount Pictures delayed some of the movies preopening parties and premieres out of deference to Sandy Hook but the studio must have felt there was too much money riding on its massive marketing campaign to postpone the actual opening. ENLARGE Tom Cruise Paramount Pictures; Still greed and insensitivity dont tell the full tale. ""Jack Reacher"" which Christopher McQuarrie directed from his adaptation of a Lee Child crime novel is not just another dumb thriller. Its almost peerlessly self-important weirdly incoherent and eerily smarmy. Its also mysteriously inept considering that Tom Cruise plays the title role a mythical veteran of Iraq who goes from city to city righting wrongs. What is Mr. Cruise doing here? What is he doing to his increasingly erratic career? He was perfectly fine in last years elaborate installment of ""Mission Impossible"" to which Mr. McQuarrie reportedly contributed rewrites because the movie had the bright idea of providing fun. The actor is no fun at all in his Jack Reacher incarnation which amounts--not just for him--to an exercise in filmed taxidermy. Not even the radiantly gifted Rosamund Pike survives the productions crippled dialogue stylistic gropes in the direction of film noir and feeble attempts at absurdist comedy not to mention though I will a succession of ludicrously leering close-ups. Almost two decades ago Mr. McQuarrie wrote a classic mindbender ""The Usual Suspects."" But hes over his head as a director and though his script strives to bend minds it numbs brains since most of its connective tissue seems to have been devoured by a screenwriting analog of necrotizing fasciitis. Its hard to say therefore exactly what the story is about but theres the shooter shooting real-estate machinations by Georgian gangsters replays of the shooter shooting Werner Herzog chewing the scenery as some sort of gulag survivor who has chewed his own fingers off a district-attorney daddys conflict with his public-defender daughter and in case the central point has been lost more shots of the shooter shooting. Before the screening friends expressed mild pleasure that the studio was providing free popcorn and soda. No no I told them you dont understand. Free popcorn and soda at a screening is a red flag; it almost always means the studio knows the movie is a turkey. How little I knew of what the studio must know. This movie is a turkey gone rancid. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""The Impossible"" an account of a family (Ewan McGregor Naomi Watts and Tom Holland) caught in the mayhem of the 2004 Tsnumai in Southeast Asia. (Photo/Video Summit Entertainment) The Impossible Ever since ""Jaws"" shots of an ominously serene sea mean ""shark."" In ""The Impossible"" they mean ""sea"" a titanic rearing-up of the Indian Ocean into the tsunami of 2004. This film achieves its own kind of impossible by creating on a substantial budget but not a huge one an astonishingly realistic re-creation of that cataclysm. Digital artistry explains part of it but I cant imagine how the director J.A. Bayona and his colleagues staged the chaotic aftermath in which vast new saltwater rivers sweep away everything and everyone in their path. ENLARGE Naomi Watts and Tom Holland Summit Entertainment Yet its not just the visuals that make the movie what it is a thrilling if also punishing tale of heroic endurance. ""The Impossible"" based on a true story derives most of its impressive power from two remarkable performances Naomi Watts as Maria a mother and physician torn from her husband (Ewan McGregor) and three sons when the tsunami hits their beach resort in Thailand and Tom Holland as Lucas the oldest of the sons whos reconnected with his mother by the floods. Lucas barely into adolescence comes of age in a matter of a few disaster-filled days. Maria is twice transformed first into a wild woman protecting one of her cubs then into a victim of massive injuries. Never has a beautiful movie star looked or acted more convincingly brutalized by random fate. --J.M. On the Road This road trip a screen adaptation of Jack Kerouacs classic anthem of the Beat Generation was directed by Walter Salles from a screenplay by Jose Rivera. Its neither the first nor the best road trip that Mr. Salles has brought to the screen. ENLARGE Sam Riley IFC Films Eight years ago he did ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" a buoyant buddy-bonding account of the young Che Guevara on a voyage of discovery through Latin America. ""On the Road"" is buoyed though only so far by Eric Gautiers cinematography and Carlos Contis production design--New York and San Francisco in the late 1940s young spirits seeking bohemian release as they hurtle across a still-rustic country in a broad-beamed maroon Hudson. Yet the narrative lacks a strong heartbeat; you keep wondering why the spectacle isnt as affecting as it is picturesque. Part of the problem lies in the nature of the production--better to read a book that a writer has written especially a book as volcanic as Kerouacs than to watch the writer writing it on the screen. Mainly though buoyancy fails because the acting is flat notwithstanding the heros declaration that hes attracted by people who ""burn burn like Roman candles across the night."" The cast includes Sam Riley as Sal Paradise Kerouacs surrogate; Garrett Hedlund as the prime Roman candle Dean Moriarty/Neal Cassady; Kristen Stewart as Marylou/LuAnne Henderson; Amy Adams as Jane/Joan Vollmer and Tom Sturridge as Carlo Marx Kerouacs stand-in for Allen Ginsberg. Its not a good sign that the movies most stirring moment comes when Sal opens an envelope that Marx has sent him and the camera studies the words of Ginsbergs legendary ""Denver Doldrums"" handwritten on a piece of paper. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""The Guilt Trip."" As inventor Andy Brewster (Seth Rogen) is about to embark on a road trip a visit with his mom (Barbara Streisand) turns into a cross-country voyage with her along for the ride. (Photo/Video Paramount) The Guilt Trip ""The Guilt Trip"" can be seen as what happened when Miss Marmelstein the wistful secretary played so sensationally by Barbra Streisand in the Broadway musical that put her on the map grew up to be the devouring Jewish mother of a nebbishy devouree played by Seth Rogen. The pretext of the movie which was directed in broadbrush-cartoon style by Anne Fletcher from a coarse-textured script by Dan Fogelman is a road trip taken by mother Joyce and son Andrew. He brings her along just like that because hes hatched a cockeyed scheme to reconnect her with an old flame and get her off his back. Andrew who has invented an organic cleaning compound pitches it to retailers in a succession of meetings across the country that have no grounding in any known reality. That describes long stretches of this short film which stops dead in its tracks for a bizarre set piece in which Joyce must scarf a 50-ounce steak for the sake of a free meal. Yet theres also a moment when she reminisces about that lost love and Ms. Streisand grounded in a reality thats both simple and affecting shows us how a cartoon can come however briefly to vivid life. --J.M. DVD Focus ENLARGE Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959) Emmanuelle Riva is superb as a French movie actress in this enigmatic incantatory debut feature by Alain Resnais. In the opening shot her nude body is intertwined with Eiji Okadas He plays a Japanese architect. Pauline Kael wasnt impressed by the movies high seriousness. ""Hushed and hypnotic"" she wrote ""it makes you so conscious of its artistry that you may feel as if in a church and need to giggle."" Most critics and moviegoers though took it very seriously as an allegorical statement against atomic bombs. The script was the work of the French writer and then director Marguerite Duras. ENLARGE The Conformist Everett Collection The Conformist (1970) Jean-Louis Trintignant plays the title role in Bernardo Bertoluccis sumptuous masterpiece set in 1930s Italy and based on a novel by Alberto Moravia. Mr. Trintignant is Marcello a man of more ambition than talent who flees what he loathes about himself by becoming a fascist assassin. The film functions as a political parable; as a psychosexual study in compensatory behavior (its not just about the emotional roots of fascism but about why sinning preachers denounce sin or deviant legislators seek to police the sort of crimes they commit) and as a supremely stylish work of cinematic art. ENLARGE All Night Long (1981) Barbra Streisand is Cheryl Gibbons a soft-spoken but savvy bleached blonde in Jean-Claude Tramonts enjoyable though at this point little known slapstick romance. Gene Hackman is George Dupler a family man in Los Angeles who drops out to enjoy life on his own terms after hes denied a promotion and demoted to night manager at an all-night drugstore. The original script was written by W.D. Richter. The cast includes Dennis Quaid as Georges son Diane Ladd as Georges wife and Kevin Dobson as Cheryls husband. --J.M.

They dont. Rogen plays Andy a chemist attempting to hawk a new miracle cleaner he invented. Setting out on a last-ditch cross-country marketing expedition to wholesalers he meets up in New Jersey with Streisands Joyce his long-widowed mother. In a fit of sympathy he invites her to join him on the road despite the fact that the whining never seems to stop between these two.The jokes mostly fall flat and the dramatic scenes fall even flatter. Its great to see Streisand in a lead role for a change but she seems dispirited by the material. As well she should be. Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for language and some risque material.)

Comments click to enlarge The Guilt Trip Rated PG-13  96 minutes  2012 Tailor-made for holiday release this sweet comedy pairs Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand (whose respective fans are two generations apart) as mother and son on a contentious cross-country road trip. The son a hapless entrepreneur is driving west to pitch a new cleaning product to wholesalers; henpecked to death by his widowed mother he conspires to reunite her with a former teenage love whos now living in San Francisco--so that shell leave him alone--and invites her to come along for the drive. The gags are all predicated on the embarrassment of traveling with ones mom car trouble forces them to pull over at a strip club where one of the girls fixes their wheel etc. Rogen and Streisand are reasonably funny together though Rogen always best when hes angry is crowded into the role of a well-mannered straight man.

James Adams The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Dec. 19 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Wednesday Dec. 19 2012 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Anne Fletcher Written by Dan Fogelman Starring Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand Classification PG Country USA Language English The tag line for The Guilt Trip reads ""Get ready for one mother of a road trip"" - the implication being you put Barbra Streisand in her first true starring role in more than 15 years in the front seat of a compact rental with big Seth Rogen and gut-shaking hilarity ensues.Sadly no. Yes Babs whos 70 now plays widowed mother Joyce to only son Andy (Rogen) and yes the duo does travel from Joyces digs in New Jersey to points south and west ostensibly to allow Andy a schlubby organic chemist to pitch sales (badly) of his own super-duper non-toxic cleaning product to Costco and Orchard Hardware. Andys original plan is to take to the highway on his own - he is of course unmarried and consistently unlucky in love - but during a stay with Mommy he finds himself moved by her loneliness and by the story she tells of a passionate but thwarted romance she had pre-marriage in her early 20s with one Andy Margolis. When Andy Internet savant that he is quickly discovers the other Andy seems to be still alive and living in San Francisco he surreptitiously adjusts his itinerary accordingly inviting Joyce along for the ride. Watch The Guilt Trip official trailer The premise (and the promise) here of course is that as the miles pass the two will be as chalk is to cheese oil to vinegar an apple to an orange. And indeed this is what happens. Unfortunately its about the only thing that happens.With a different script and a different (that is to say male) director the trip might have been a variation on National Lampoons Vacation Planes Trains and Automobiles or the Hangover flicks - a mayhem-filled romp in other words the comedy as broad as America is wide. Certainly scenarist Dan Fogelman (Crazy Stupid Love) provides director Anne Fletcher (The Proposal 27 Dresses) with plenty of set pieces for this potential to be realized. See Mommy and son share motel rooms See a lap dancer fix their car  See son reunited with the girl he proposed to at 18 Alas nothing much is done with these elements as scriptwriter and director almost invariably go for the wry chuckle and the sentimental epiphany rather than the big laugh or the painful embarrassment. That theres a real timidity to the proceedings is something of a surprise. After all Rogen and Streisand previously have demonstrated little hesitation in finding scenery to chew or a scene to steal. Streisand here however is little more than your stereotypical Jewish mother her kvetching and noodging leavened occasionally with a kvell like ""Remember how good you were in Man of La Mancha""That this should be the vehicle Streisand chose as her comeback of sorts - she with Rogen is among the seven executive producers - is enough to make you wanna holler Oy vey Rogen meanwhile holds himself largely in check exploding every now and then (one motel-room scene in which he shouts at his mother to ""just shut up"" packs a real jolt) but never travelling into the Land of Wack. Intriguingly the films funniest bit occurs at the end as the credits roll - its a series of outtakes of Babs trading smart barbs with Rogen in their rent-a-car. Scripted? Improvised? Who knows - or cares. Its just too bad they didnt make it into the actual movie. To its detriment The Guilt Trip opts to work gently on the heart rather than hard on the funny bone.

The Guilt Trip (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Guilt Trip (PG-13) Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen play mother and son in this agreeable comedy. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com12/19/2012 Editor rating 3 Road trip movies are the ultimate copout. Theres usually no need for the screenwriter to waste a lot of time coming up with a plot because theres a formula already in place. Take two bickering disparate characters. Stick them in a car going cross-country for reasons that usually make little sense. Guide them through adventures in different states until they reach their destination and -- inevitably -- a greater understanding of each other. The Guilt Trip follows this path dutifully but turns out to be something of a delight anyway. Its charm comes from stars Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen as a mother and son traveling from New Jersey to San Francisco and if you think this an odd pairing stop and think about it again and you may change your mind. Streisand fresh off the horrors of Little Fockers plays a doting mother to Rogens beleaguered adult son who is smart enough to have a degree in organic chemistry but too emotionally confounded by his sweetly intrusive mom to realize that shes not always wrong about everything. The film written by Dan Fogelman who wrote last years hilarious Crazy Stupid Love even offers up a plausible explanation for the trip Andy (Rogen) has developed a safe effective organic cleaning product and hes scheduled meetings at companies across the country in order to pitch it (hes too broke to fly). Spending a few days in Jersey with his widowed mom Joyce (Streisand) before he heads out he learns that she may have an old flame in California. In a fit of guilt and genuine desire to see her happy which he regrets almost immediately he invites her along for the drive hoping for a reunion when they reach their final destination. Streisand is an old pro at comedy of course and Rogen is likewise gifted and director Anne Fletcher -- whose 27 Dresses is one of the most underrated romantic comedies of the past 10 years -- wisely allows them room to improvise so they truly sound like a boundaries-challenged mother and her exasperated son. Their chemistry fuels The Guilt Trip which improves steadily as Joyce and Andy wind from Jersey to Tennessee to Texas. By the time they reach the Lone Star State and Joyce accepts a restaurants challenge to eat what looks like a quarter of a cow in under an hour youre hooked on this odd couple. The humor is mostly gentle in nature; The Guilt Trip is clearly targeted at older audiences less than receptive to the crude jokes that made Rogen famous in movies like Knocked Up and Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Even an unexpected stop at a strip club doesnt yield much off-color humor. But even if your taste in gags runs to Pineapple Express territory you may find yourself invested in whether Andy finally recognizes his mother for what she is A busybody an over-sharer someone to drive you absolutely crazy if shes your mother but an impressive woman nonetheless. Want to impress your mom for the holidays? Treat her to The Guilt Trip -- and avoid suffering through one of your own. Cast Barbra Streisand Seth Rogen Brett Cullen Kathy Najimy.

Rating PG-13 for profanity. RELATED NEWS Interview Streisand Rogen bond on Guilt Trip By Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Dec 19 2012 928 AM ""The Guilt Trip"" has a perfect sitcom premise An odd-couple mother and son travel cross-country together. She nags he whines and everything somehow works out in the end. Sounds trite? Definitely and it would be in the wrong hands. But ""The Guilt Trip"" surprises by avoiding the obvious. It zigs when you expect it to zag. Its perceptive and thoughtful as it swerves around potholes that easily could have broken an axle. Barbra Streisand plays the mother and her performance is one of those things that catches a viewer off-guard. This isnt the hammy over-the-top Streisand from the ""Meet the Fockers"" family. Instead she gives a lovely nuanced performance. She can be wildly funny but she doesnt turn the character into a cartoon to achieve laughs. Shes always warmly human even if her manicured nails look divine. Streisand plays Joyce Brewster the feisty widowed mom of Andy (Seth Rogen) a schlubby single chemist who lives in California. He travels to see his mother in New Jersey as hes about to hit the road to pitch an eco-friendly cleanser to retailers around the country. Mom calls his pitch meetings ""shows"" which makes Andy silently fume. Its one of those harmless slips parents make that drive their children batty. After Andy learns that Joyce deeply loved a man who lives in San Francisco he asks her to accompany him on the trip. He doesnt tell her that his goal is to hook Joyce up with her long-lost love. Shes overjoyed thinking her son wants to spend more time together. Once the two hit the road the movie becomes a series of vignettes that explore the dynamics of their relationship. They stop at a topless club because Joyce mistook it for a restaurant that sells tapas. In Texas she attempts to eat a 4/1-pound steak (""Like a small poodle"" Andy marvels) to win a free meal. And on the drive they listen to the audio version of ""Middlesex"" Jeffrey Eugenides novel about a hermaphrodite which makes Andy squirm. Even when the movie threatens to go broad and silly it never does. At the strip club Joyces motherly instinct kicks in when she notices the skimpy outfit a helpful stripper is wearing. A handsome cowboy (Brett Cullen) flirts with her in Texas and she has been alone so long she doesnt know how to deal with it. For his part Andy is perpetually annoyed by his mother who has devoted her whole life to him (wisely the movie avoids turning Joyce into a stereotypical Jewish mother; religion is never mentioned). He grits his teeth at her in public reacting like a pouty teenager and unaware of how he comes off. But theres always a bond between the two. There is a sweetly tender scene in which he catches his mom sleeping that silently encapsulates those odd moments in which parent-child roles are suddenly reversed. Writer Dan Fogelman (""Crazy Stupid Love"") based the movie on a trip he took with his mother which could be why so much of the movie rings true. He displays a knack for believable dialogue and the back-and-forth between Joyce and Andy seems wonderfully real. Some moments could even be ad-libbed; it feels that natural. Director Anne Fletcher (""The Proposal"") lets the movie unfold at a pleasant pace. She never pushes too hard for a joke another surprise. The film is wildly funny but there also are stretches that inspire chuckles or merely smiles. Its a wise move because this is a movie thats too grounded in reality to sell out its characters for wall-to-wall laughs. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonaepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

(PARAMOUNT) Im not sure if ""The Guilt Trip"" is meant to be a warm serious movie with funny moments or a light funny movie with serious moments. But its not hilarious enough to be a big comedy or touching enough to be truly dramatic. Its just sort of...there. Thats not surprising given the middling pedigree. Anne Fletcher is a long-time choreographer who backed into directing with the first ""Step Up."" Since then shes given us ""The Proposal"" which was sort of awkward and ""27 Dresses"" which was a Katherine Heigl movie. Thanks a lot Anne. And writer Dan Fogelman is a definite either/or guy. Either he turns out something really inventive like ""Tangled"" or ""Crazy Stupid Love"" or he turns out something just tiresomely mediocre like ""Cars"" ""Cars 2"" or ""Fred Claus."" ""The Guilt Trip"" is definitely one of his ""or"" scripts. The story stars Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen as mother and son. She adores him but is a noodge full of phone calls and unwanted advice; he keeps her at a distance but worries that more than 20 years after his fathers death she still hasnt moved on. So when a cross-country business trip looms he has an idea - why not take Mom along? Without telling her of course that at the end of the trip hes going to introduce her to her long-lost first boyfriend? Thats the plot and not too much about it works. Mostly its because its not willing to do the work. Even if you dont go the full ""Wheres Poppa"" theres a lot more comedy to be mined out of a smothering mother/son relationship than a nice lady in a T-shirt telling you to keep hydrating and asking if you have a girlfriend. The comedy in something like this should come from extremes. Instead the filmmakers play it down the middle. Perhaps the impulse was not to ask Streisand to play too much of a monster. But watering down the character not only makes her uninteresting it turns Rogens character into a creep; if shes not really all that bad then his protests come off as mere cranky childishness. Rogen does what he can with his patented mutters and half-spoken asides. But the real laughs in something like springs from a character who stifles his anger only to finally explode at an inappropriate time and in an exaggerated way. Rogen just kvetches and then turns nasty. Thats not comedy thats a bad Sunday dinner. Streisand gets one or two good scenes and points for being game enough to play a movie in shabby T-shirts and schlumpy shoes. (Although her nails remain of course to die for. To die for) The sharp and funny Nora Dunn gets a brief good spot near the end. But for a road-trip movie the film has little sense of place (apparently Mom lives in Jersey - we get references to Newark and Montclair - but none of the states they pass through makes any real impression probably because the star refused to shoot on location). Scenes at a strip club and Rogens many business meetings also fall flat. Like the journey its supposedly about ""The Guilt Trip"" goes by quickly enough and occasionally stops for a brief scenic Kodak moment. But it takes more than a few wrong turns. And once youve reached the end you have no urge to ever do it again. Ratings note The film contains sexual references and strong language.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its a testament to Barbra Streisands newfound humility that in the family road comedy The Guilt Trip she allows herself to be cast as the endearingly irritating mother of a geeky middle-aged Jewish man instead of his slightly older but still alluring girlfriend. Though intermittently bathed in a halo of golden light and desired by at least one handsome distinguished older man with a thing for mature women with healthy appetites Streisand in The Guilt Trip is largely devoid of her famous vanity and narcissism. Her performance captures how parents are often annoying to their grown progeny because of their good intentions not in spite of them If they didnt want the best for the children they so selflessly raised they wouldnt be such goddamned persistent pests. Rogen who co-executive-produced with Streisand stars as a struggling scientist and inventor who heads out on the road with his long-widowed mother trying to sell a poorly packaged and named natural cleaning product of his own design to chain stores and home-shopping networks. Rogen has an ulterior motive for taking Streisand on the trip He wants to play matchmaker between his mother who has been single since Rogens father died and her first love whom she lost contact with ages ago but still thinks about. The Guilt Trip is casually astute and clever about the way even sane responsible adults revert back to being prickly children when confronted with the gale-force wind of a parents intense misguided attention. But while Streisand and Rogens relationship is smartly affectionately drawn just about every other element of the movie feels perfunctory from the hooey about Streisands lost love to the flat uninspired direction of 27 Dresses/The Proposal helmer Anne Fletcher. The films end credits feature Rogen and Streisand riffing off each other in ostensibly improvised outtakes that are far funnier and livelier than anything in the movie hinting at the better comedy that might have ensued had the filmmakers trusted their leads chemistry and chops more rather than watering them down with schmaltz and shtick wacky eating contests contrived plotting and a horribly hokey happy ending.

"Guilt Trip | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; guilt-trip ) Guilt Trip (United States 2012) December 19 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Anne Fletchers Guilt Trip is essentially a mismatched buddy road comedy. Thats a genre as old as the cinema and it cant be said that Guilt Trip does anything sufficiently interesting to warrant notice (unless you count Barbra Streisand dropping the f-bomb to be ""sufficiently interesting""). To its credit the screenplay credited to Dan Fogelman and based on a real-life incident doesnt take every predictable detour but it takes enough that the movie never ceases to feel overly familiar. Theres not much to the story - its a road trip from New Jersey to California with would-be inventor Andy Brewster (Seth Rogen) and his bossy stereotypical Jewish mother Joyce (Barbra Streisand). Andys trying to sell a cleaning product to various distribution outlets and Joyce is along to provide moral support. Actually Andys taking Joyce to San Francisco so she can catch up with her first true love although one wonders whether such an act of filial devotion deserves the punishment of having to endure Joyce for a week. I was only in the theater for about 90 minutes and I had my fill of her. As with all buddy movies and romantic comedies its all about chemistry. Rogen and Streisand have just enough for the film to work. Theyre believable in their respective roles - Rogen as the son who finds living across the country from his mom to be the perfect distance and Streisand as the woman who cant let go. Andy has gotten into the habit of ignoring his mother - something that proves impossible when theyre sitting in a car together. Joyce on the other hand has gotten into the habit of being ignored and presses the advantage when she has it. Needless to say the emotional core of Guilt Trip is about how these two overcome their differences and come away with a deeper appreciation of one another. Both attain closure. I have no idea why this movie wasnt targeted for a Mothers Day weekend release. Rogen plays against type as an uptight guy who has probably never smoked weed in his life. He stays in the background willingly ceding the spotlight to Streisand who needs it to thrive. She is as usual bigger than life but shes well cast in the role. The baggage she brings with her helps. Shes not required to do a lot of acting; all she has to do is feed the stereotype. Shes the busybody Jewish mother who wants her boy to show her respect and find a nice girl to settle down with. Joyce goes so far as to reunite Andy with an old flame with predictably disastrous results. The movie is humorous in the way that films of this sort typically are. There are some amusing lines worthy of chuckles and maybe even a hardier laugh from time-to-time. The production reeks of geniality. It so desperately wants to be likeable that it ends up being bland. Good scenes like the one in which Andy and Joyce finally take the gloves off and have a genuine heart-to-heart (this is where the ""fuck"" comes in) are easily forgotten amidst the pervasive mediocrity that saturates so much of the movie. Guilt Trip isnt bad but its not very good either. Its the kind of thing you might not turn off if you stumbled upon it on cable late at night but the idea of anyone who isnt a die-hard Barbra Streisand fan paying good money for the privilege of watching this movie seems unlikely. Streisands reason for making the film is unclear although the fact that the entire thing was shot within 45 minutes of her home may have something to do with it. One must give director Fletcher credit she masterfully creates the illusion of a cross-country car trip when not a days worth of first unit shooting took place outside of Southern California. Arguably thats the most remarkable thing about Guilt Trip. Normally its said that in a road trip the destination is less important than the route taken getting there. In this case each is equally unimportant. Guilt Trip is cinematic comfort food for road trip fans who arent given indigestion by Streisand.

"The Guilt Trip is a mom-safe and surprisingly sweet journey - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate The Guilt Trip is a mom-safe and surprisingly sweet journey Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 12.19.12 | 907 AM The idea that Barbra Streisand might have given birth to Seth Rogen actually makes a twisted kind of biological sense but it prompts one to wonder Who on earth was the father? Zero Mostel? Fozzie Bear? Sadly ""The Guilt Trip"" doesnt speculate upon matters genetic. Whoever Dad was he has been peacefully dead for years and Mama Streisand has been on High Noodge ever since. The movies silly predictable and surprisingly sweet -- the sort of thing you can and probably should take your mother to. Rogen plays Andrew an organic chemist (not a doctor but close) who has invented a nontoxic cleaning product and is taking a road trip across the country to shill it to chain stores like Kmart and Costco. The product is called Sci-O-Clean its packaging is more cluttered than Dr. Bronners and Andrew has the showmanship of well an organic chemist. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters But he tells his mom Joyce (Streisand) that all is going well because to admit defeat would be to invite her advice. Which she gives anyway endlessly. The star knows from Jewish mothers and assorted yentas even if the script carefully purges ethnicity from the proceedings so that no one out in Nebraska will be offended. Joyces last name is Brewster for pitys sake. If Streisands own mother knew itd kill her. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Dont ask how but the screenplay by Dan Fogelman (""Crazy Stupid Love."") gets these two in a tiny car and out into the heartland where bickering and mild comedy follow. ""The Guilt Trip"" largely avoids the crassness of the ""Fockers"" movies and the Apatow school -- another reason your Nana will love it -- but doesnt replace it with much besides broad culture clashes and the sight of Streisand at her most relaxed. Joyce is meant to be a yammering pain but the star simply has too much fun asking Rogens Andy if he ""has to make"" or licking her hand and fixing his hair or warning against hitchhikers because ""they rape."" The movies halfway to a brilliant comedy of embarrassment but director Anne Fletcher (""The Proposal"") doesnt have the imagination or the nerve. The best scenes in ""The Guilt Trip"" are also the weirdest and they seem to happen by accident like Joyce flirting with a handsome Marlboro Man (Brett Cullen) after eating a 4-pound steak on a bet. Rogen just stands by in slack-jawed awe for that one and I cant blame him. By the time the movie gets to journeys end in San Francisco -- and a possible rendezvous with an old flame of Joyces -- youll either be along for the ride or begging for the mercy of a quick death. A small sentimental effective twist ending is just the coup de grace. ""The Guilt Trip"" is tripe but its tripe that knows its audience. Seriously take your mother. Itll be a mitzvah.

Starring Seth Rogen Barbra Streisand Adam Scott Director Anne Fletcher Release Opened Dec 19 2012  Editorial Review Moms driving her son insaneBy Ann HornadayFriday December 21 2012""Hows your hangnail?"" Do you remember that one? Its the flawlessly delivered punch line from an old routine by comic duo Mike Nichols and Elaine May in which she played an overbearing mother to his exasperated adult son. ""The Guilt Trip"" Anne Fletchers lifeless comedy about an overbearing mother and her exasperated adult son has no flawlessly delivered punch lines. It doesnt even have a hangnail. Instead it has a series of clunky episodic scenes of ersatz intimacy in which Seth Rogen -- here playing an organic scientist named Andy Brewster -- tries desperately to play off of Barbra Streisand as she preens and poses for a camera she wants very badly to still love her. (She shouldnt worry it does.) As Joyce Brewster a middle-class single mom from New Jersey who accompanies Andy on a sales trip across the country Streisand asks the audience to believe shed actually be wowed by a budget motel and the prospect of a free continental breakfast. Thats just one of myriad whoppers that this patently dishonest utterly undistinguished enterprise tries to get past viewers who might expect more considering Streisands daffier more liberated turns in the ""Meet the Fockers"" movies. (That ""The Guilt Trip"" is so poorly executed shouldnt come as a shock to anyone familiar with Fletchers earlier comedies the execrable ""27 Dresses"" and ""The Proposal"" which owed its success to the genuinely fizzy chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.) Admittedly there are one or two memorable moments in ""The Guilt Trip"" which was written by Dan Fogelman. The fearless laser-focused Streisand of yore peeks out briefly during a come-to-Jesus speech Joyce delivers to Andy as he begs her to stop talking (""I dont know what to say"" she mutters her self-pity meter set at 11). And darned if the films payoff when the duo finally reach San Francisco for a pivotal personal encounter doesnt land right in the sweet spot. But such fleeting moments arent worth a tedious cliched schlep that includes a painful stunt during which Streisand eats a four-pound steak and a pointless sequence when Joyce and Andy look at the Grand Canyon turn around and leave which turns out to be an apt metaphor for ""The Guilt Trip"" itself. From Mike Nicholss hangnail the mind inevitably wanders to other better movies about parent-child dynamics eventually hitting on ""Mother"" the 1996 movie starring Albert Brooks and Debbie Reynolds that although no masterpiece possessed a comparative wealth of observant psychological humor. In a bizarro case of movie mix-and-matching Brooks appears today in ""This Is 40"" by frequent Rogen collaborator Judd Apatow. Maybe someone should get word to Apatow that the two would be perfectly cast as dad and son. ""Father"" anyone?Contains profanity and some risque material.

This cheesy comedy concerns a nerdy 30-something loser named Andy (Seth Rogen) and his obnoxious overbearing mother Joyce (Ms. Streisand) on a road trip from Manhattan to San Francisco that is understandably a vacation from hell. Eventually mother and son get to like each other a little better than when they started but only after what seems like pages of discarded jokes from canceled TV sitcom pilots. Eight days in a car with these two is like eight weeks with shingles. After two abominable Fockers movies Ms. Streisand has gone on record saying she will never play any more rolling-voweled Jewish mothers but that is exactly what she does here. Saving bottles to reuse several times over to save money collecting ceramic frogs noisily crunching Mamp;Ms--shes a pickled Fanny Brice. Mr. Rogen who looks like Limburger cheese has carved an inexplicable career out of playing dorks who make the word ""retarded"" politically acceptable again; but Andy is to his mother the perfect son who can do no wrong. Instead of wondering why he repels women like a goiter she blames his bachelor status on the pathetic ignorance of liberated women today. In truth hes pudgy and plain as a wet mop a college grad who cant get a job. Now hes invented a cleaning fluid nobody wants and is on the verge of a cross-country mission to sell the product. In the inane small talk that overwhelms this thin little movie like a hailstorm Joyce reveals she was once madly passionately in love with another young man named Andy who inspired her sons name. Intrigued he traces his namesake to a San Francisco advertising agency and for reasons too specious to go into this unlikely mother-son team drives away in a rented Dodge SUV. Without a defining narrative the rest of the movie lazily written by Dan Fogelman and tediously directed by Anne Fletcher as though intimidated into catatonia by the bigger-than-life Streisand meanders through a series of dull pit-stop adventures that substitute for action. Joyce brings along a book on tape about a hermaphrodite. She carries a hook around to hang her purse from various tables because the floors are dirty. While Andy pitches his invention to deaf ears Joyce gets hit on in a bar by a tough dude who gives her son a black eye. In Lubbock Texas she enters a humongous steak-eating contest where she is forced to swallow four pounds of rare sirloin without throwing up and attracts the attention of a handsome cowboy who asks her for a date on his next trip to New York. Onward to the Grand Canyon a Las Vegas casino and ... but why go on? Wherever they land there is nothing to write home about and what happens is not worth repeating. All you can really do is stare at every calculated movement of a great star drowning in material as bland and gummy as oatmeal. You cant make caviar out of jujubes but La Streisand is living proof that you can die trying. Unfortunately she doesnt sing but the voice is like buttah. The wig looks good. You cant take your eyes off the cherry talons she calls nails. She still holds attention. I dont like to see the legendary star of Funny Girl and The Way We Were reduced to playing Molly Goldberg on a bad day but sympathy goes just so far. Star vehicles even for icons are not what they used to be. She doesnt need the money. So whats the excuse? With The Guilt Trip she cant claim senior citizen victimization.

This holiday season when you care enough to do the very least why not start with an e-card then invite your liked ones over for a meal of Dinty Moore and egg noodles. Conclude by taking everyone out to see an aggressively average movie like ""The Guilt Trip."" Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand star as a cringing son and nagging mom driving across a large country in a small car. Its a one-joke movie if ""Jewish mothers are annoying"" is a joke. But just as a film about boredom should not actually be boring no movie should credibly simulate the experience of being stuck in a car with Barbra Streisand for eight days. Not unless its being billed as ""a spine-tingling tale of modern horror."" The pretext for the excursion is thin bordering on bulimic. Andy (Rogen) is visiting home in New Jersey from LA where he has invented an organic cleaning liquid that he is pitching to various national retailers on a single trip. He learns that his widowed mom Joyce (Streisand) who greets him at the airport with the line ""All grown up and wearing a sports jacket"" still has a crush on the boy -- also named Andy -- she dated before she met his father. A bit of Googling reveals that the ex-boyfriend now works in San Francisco so naturally the son who was named after him invites Mom on the trip with plans to show up unannounced on the doorstep of the older man even though he dumped her all those years ago. Right. Cue embarrassing automotive breakdowns embarrassing Mom-requested visits to old girlfriends a steak-eating contest in Texas lines like ""You can take one of my books in the bathroom if you have to make"" and a stop at a topless joint ""Does that say tapas? I love tapas."" I hear your groans my friends but theyre no louder than my own. I expected better from screenwriter Dan Fogelman who did the sprightly and original ""Crazy Stupid Love"" but the bigger surprise is that a talent like Rogen would consent to be reduced to the straight man in this vaudeville act. Rogen started off by giving every sign that he wanted to do interesting work dollars be damned but . . . earlier this year he co-wrote the abysmal alien-invasion comedy ""The Watch"" and now this. I guess most comics turn lame in the end but 30 seems awfully young to give up. (Incidentally if Mom dated the other Andy at age ""19 or 20"" then quickly moved on to another man and immediately got pregnant with Andy I guess that means Streisand is only about 52. How odd that she looks 70.) Despite dull direction by chick-flick specialist Anne Fletcher (when theres a shot of the car heading right and Andy is protesting that theyre going in the wrong direction its obvious that the next shot will be of the car heading left) ""The Guilt Trip"" isnt a total loss. After a while Andy stops simply blanching at Moms inappropriateness (calling Asians ""Orientals"" or telling how his penis once turned purple) and starts firing back with his own one-liners which sound like Rogen wrote them. Andy has a triumphant moment of his own when he gets to hawk his wares on the Home Shopping Network in a scene that yielded for me the only big laugh of the movie. The rest isnt exactly funny but those who havent much kept up with comedy developments in the past 30 years -- like your mom -- might mistake it for entertainment. On the other hand wouldnt she think you were maybe trying to tell her something about her nagging? Maybe youd never hear the end of it. Best not to risk it.

Sometimes it feels as if Rogen is in awe of acting with Streisand and reins in his natural comic self.Rogen plays nerdy Andrew a chemist who hits the road with his overbearing widowed mom Joyce as he tries to sell an eco-friendly cleaning product he created. The film opens with him dodging her incessant phone calls. Yet when he goes to visit her in New Jersey he inexplicably invites his mom along on a cross-country business trip where he plans to pitch his cleanser to a host of companies around the USA.ALEXANDER Streisand and Rogens relationship is a guilty pleasureMORE Barbra Streisand strikes chord with real sonHis invitation comes after she tells him a story about an old flame. Clearly the guy meant a lot to her so Andrew does some cyber research to track him down. On a whim he decides he should re-start his moms dating career.Streisands Joyce is Every Nagging Mom and then some. Shes over-invested in her sons life still buying him socks and underwear and showing him off to her gal pals at the first opportunity. But she does have the good sense to wonder if shell get on his nerves in such close quarters? You think?So many things dont make sense in this extended sitcom. Why does her son let her accompany him on his business meetings if he knows shell only embarrass him by trying to spit-clean a spot on his face or yell out ""Good luck honey"" in a quiet corporate environment? Oh thats right its to make us giggle. If only we could.In one particularly off-putting scene the pair stops off at a Texas steakhouse and Joyce decides to consume mass quantities in order to get a free meal. You havent lived until youve watched Streisand make a pig of herself and flirt with a handsome cowboy at the same time.Joyce commandeers the journey insisting they listen to an audiobook Jeffrey Eugenides Middlesex (in a whole new kind of product placement) and arranges an awkward stopover to visit Andrews high school girlfriend (Yvonne Strahovski) and her new husband (Colin Hanks).Still it turns out that Mother knows best -- at least when it comes to cleaning products.In addition to the constant friction theres some forced drama when Joyce learns that her son is trying to set her up with her old boyfriend. Its a bit like the phony hurdles erected in rom-coms -- artificial-seeming and necessary only to make for a more sentimental resolution.The only remotely funny moments are saved for the outtakes that appear after the closing credits.Mostly what audiences will come away with after sitting through this predictable cliched and ultimately gooey mother-son bonding experience is how good Streisand looks at 70.The Guilt Trip Clip Waiting AreaSkip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Joyce (Barbra Streisand) encourages Andy (Seth Rogen) before his sales pitch. 35 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/RC7yrP",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/12/18/guilt-trip-review/1764491/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader,200,theguilttrip18,theguilttrip,usatoday

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Wednesday December 19 2012 600 AM Title The Guilt Trip Film Info PG-13 Language. Area theaters. If you laid out the Freudian issues in Anne Fletchers ""The Guilt Trip"" end to end they would probably stretch all the way to Vienna. This is one seriously uncomfortable movie especially considering that its being presented as a feel-good comedy. As anyone whos followed their recent press tour knows Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen make a pretty cute team. And their mutual affinity goes a long way toward lightening a tough trip. Rogen plays Andrew a scientist whos poured his life savings into creating a new organic cleanser. After stopping to visit his widowed mom Joyce (Streisand) he plans to drive cross-country to pitch his product. At Joyces house he realizes shes as lonely as he is and impulsively invites her along. Dan Fogelmans script doesnt take us anywhere especially exciting veering off-road for dull pit stops and meandering pointlessly in the car. The trip therefore goes exactly as wed expect Joyce nags Andrew incessantly meddles in his life outrageously and drives him absolutely nuts. But she also has some good insights and clearly adores him. Fletcher (""The Proposal"") favors a broad sensibility as well. But her stars bless them know better. As written Andrew is a sad-sack doormat who desperately needs to establish some boundaries. Somehow Rogen manages to turn him into a respectful son whose remarkable levels of patience are borne as much of love as a desire to keep the peace. Streisand has an even tougher job. Joyce could so easily have been a shrill cliched caricature. Instead she locates the affection in this womans neuroses rather than lazily exaggerating them for comic effect. She and Rogen understand each other and we can see the fondness between them. But its hard to understand why they chose such a lackluster project -- especially Streisand who so rarely accepts leading roles. While the actors are appealing their weirdly co-dependent characters arent. And they dont learn enough to balance out the bland intermittently irritating nature of their adventures. Viewers however can take the movies lesson to heart while planning their own holiday trips The only thing more crucial than choosing the right company is planning the proper route.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies The Guilt Trip The Return of the Funny Lady Streisand hits the road with Seth Rogen in a charming holiday movie about mothers and sons By Mary Pols MaryPolsDec. 18 2012 Share Read Later Paramount Pictures The Guilt Triip Year 2012 Director Anne Fletcher Studio Paramount PIctures Actors Barbra Streisand Seth Rogen Kathy Najimy Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture When Joyce Brewster (Barbra Streisand) and her son Andy (Seth Rogen) set off on an East-West cross country road trip--he to shill the awkwardly named all-natural cleaning product he invented she to fuss over his dietary and sartorial needs--the first thing she does is put a book on tape in the cars player. A melodious male voice fills the car (""I was born twice first as a baby girl on a remarkably smogless Detroit day in January of 1960; and then again as a teenage boy in an emergency room near Petoskey Michigan in August of 1974."") Its Jeffrey Eugenides Middlesex. Andys eyes opened wide in surprise and so did mine; I would have taken Joyce for more of an Anita Shreve type. The Guilt Trip is not what I expected either. Directed by Anne Fletcher (The Proposal) from a screenplay by Dan Fogelman it deals in stereotypes--overbearing Jewish mother nebbishy son steadily mortified by her--but without the broad frenetic desperate comedy of say Streisands most recent ventures into cinema the lame Meet the Fockers and the truly horrible Little Fockers. Its a mainstream film but these stock characters are humanized and given a low key refreshingly reasonable mission to know and respect each other a little better. Charming and thoughtful The Guilt Trip is essentially a two-person play acted by two performers who hail from different worlds--Rogen from pothead humor central she from diva city--yet who have natural relaxed chemistry together. They could be related. Im not sure if Rogens Pineapple Express fan base will rush to see it but if they do I bet they call their mothers afterward. Regardless for Streisand who turned 70 this year and hasnt taken a lead role in a film since 1996s The Mirror Has Two Faces The Guilt Trip is a smart venture back into theaters. (READ About Joel Steins (short) road trip with Barbra Streisand) The Guilt Trip works because we all know and like a Joyce Brewster (or dozens of them). Joyce has a big personality but shes not a cartoon; if anyone is going to make jokes about Jewish mothers it will be her. She is an outspoken self-aware woman of a certain age who has discovered the miraculous comfort of track suits. She uses something called a purse hook which hangs off tables thereby preventing her purse from touching any dirty floors. She spends a lot of time at The Gap. Her community of friends is built around Weight Watchers. But mostly she lives for her son--3000 miles away in Los Angeles but still her focus. Which is obviously problematic. Andys dad died when he was 8 and Joyce hasnt dated since then. She tells her son she has grown used to the pleasures of solitude. (In the opening scene of the film Streisand wakes in her rumpled bed rolls over on one of the previous nights peanut Mamp;Ms and eats it. Its a funny little thrill seeing Streisand this consummate protector of her own image doing something so very common woman. I felt like I was glimpsing the Pope cleaning his cats litter box.) At a meeting of the Montclair Mature Singles Club Joyce can be overheard saying impatiently--to a perfectly pleasant looking gentleman--""No I dont hike Try the skinny one in the corner."" (SEE LIFE photos of the young Barbra Streisand) Mother and son have no plans to travel together initially. Andy comes East to meet with Kmart representatives to see if theyll place an order for Scieoclean the nontoxic cleaner he dreamed up while working for the EPA. But hes too self-conscious to make a good salesman unlike his mother who can talk to anyone. Hed never dream of asking her to help him on the road (hes got stops planned at major corporations all across the country). But he gets the idea to bring her along after she tells him about the guy who got away just before she married his dad the man she would have happily married if hed asked whose name she actually passed on to him her only child. Touched Andy does something his mother has never done; searches for the man online. Fogelman who also wrote Crazy Stupid Love and Cars makes a point of how easy this is in our hyper-connected society--it only takes Andy one phone call to find out Joyces other Andy lives in San Francisco. Without telling her why he asks Joyce to join him on the trip. They have a few adventures along the way some predictable embarrassment at a strip club and a scene where Joyce takes on a restaurants challenge of eating a 50 oz. steak to get her meal for free. ""Thats like eating a poodle"" Rogen says his level quiet delivery just right. But its all pretty mild stuff. Thats because Fogelmans screenplay--which was inspired by a road trip he took with his mother who the film is dedicated to--isnt aimed at raucous laughs. The movie is funny but its main goal is to get mother and son to reconsider each other as individuals. For Joyce that means letting go of her little boy with potential (""Remember how good you were in Man of La Mancha?"") and seeing who he is now. For Andy the challenge is bigger; hes supposed to be in his late 20s (Rogen himself turned 30 this year) but hes got a case of arrested development and is nearly as embarrassed by his mother as a teenager might be. Heres the realism of The Guilt Trip--he has no compunction about letting her know that. The movies success is completely dependent on their eventual showdown which I wont spoil except to say that Streisand kills it with dignity. The  funny lady is back. If she wants to be. With Streisand you never know when she might decide to direct have another comeback tour take a part in a movie. Or just stay home.

Seth Rogen plays a chemist trying to sell his invention while on a road trip with his mom played by Barbra Streisand. Photo Sam Emerson Associated Press Guilt Trip review Its a fun trip 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Guilt Trip Comedy. Starring Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand. Directed by Anne Fletcher. (PG-13. 95 minutes.) This must have been the easiest movie to sell Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen as mother and son. The poster alone for ""Guilt Trip"" is irresistible - two of them crammed into a small car Mom driving Sonny crazy and piling on the guilt with a steam shovel. That sounds fun but the actual movie is different and better. ""Guilt Trip"" is not some extended Hollywood sketch about mother-son relationships and if you expected some stereotypical riff on Jewish mothers forget it. Rogen and Streisands name is Brewster in this and theyre not identified in terms of any specific religion or culture. The title notwithstanding theres not even much guilt to speak of - certainly none dished out by the mother. Instead we have something rare a warm and insightful comedy about a mother and her grown son. The characters are rendered in specific terms and yet many people will doubtless recognize elements from their own lives. In ""Guilt Trip"" Streisand plays the kind of mother who if her son were Lee Harvey Oswald would find a way to blame Kennedy. Her belief in him is so complete and unshakable - and to him so irrational and baseless - that he takes her for granted maybe even thinks shes a bit thick. He doesnt quite realize that she is the water in his psychological aquarium. In ""Guilt Trip"" Rogen plays an organic chemist who devises a 100 percent organic cleaning product that is so safe you can drink it. In an early scene we see him pitching it to the board at Kmart getting flustered and bogged down in corny jokes and scientific jargon. Here as always Rogen is not a cheap-laugh guy but a truthful comic actor so that the scene is funny but painful too He really has something wonderful to sell but hell never sell it this way. Most of ""Guilt Trip"" takes place over the course of a long driving trip from New York to San Francisco. The son has arranged a series of pitch meetings across the country but he also hopes to surprise his mother a widow by reintroducing her to her first beau who lives in California. So he invites her to come along. There are laughs throughout but ""Guilt Trip"" isnt joke-happy. The humor is light and well observed as when Mom keeps playing the audiobook of ""Middlesex"" and the son gets uncomfortable hearing about anything sexual in front of his mother. The real appeal of ""Guilt Trip"" is not in the bits but in the interaction between Streisand and Rogen who are completely convincing as mother and son. Maturity has released something in Streisand who having gone beyond trying to sell herself as a babe (as in ""The Mirror Has Two Faces"") has a new warmth. When she looks at Rogen you know that she sees him - everything good in him everything lacking everything ridiculous all his potential and all his history. You believe that she used to change his diapers. You also believe Rogen who has the real journey of discovery in ""Guilt Trip."" What a lucky guy His mother thinks hes great so hes always going to think hes great if only deep in his core. His mother is loving so hes always going to be loving and expect love from women. Far from a nuisance his mother is his edge in every possible way one person can help another person. ""Guilt Trip"" is about a sons coming to realize those things and how sometimes that takes years.

"The Guilt Trip? Better theyd stayed home Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowMovie review The Guilt Trip? Better theyd stayed homeThere was something promising about the match-up of Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen as mother and son. Too bad The Guilt Trip is unfunny unreal and agonizingly long.December 18 2012|By Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand star in ""The Guilt Trip."" (Sam Emerson Paramount...)In ""The Guilt Trip"" which features Barbra Streisands first starring performance in more than 15 years the definitive diva plays a lighthearted version of a stereotypical Jewish mother eating candy in bed and endlessly doting on her only son played by Seth Rogen.He is an aspiring inventor who has lined up a series of meetings across the country to try to sell his nontoxic household cleaner to box stores and other major retailers. Circumstance and a little affectionate subterfuge on his part lead him to invite her along.Screenwriter Dan Fogelmans script for last years ""Crazy Stupid Love"" ably pulled together a comedy of contemporary living with only-in-the-movies exaggerations yet here he achieves no such balance ""The Guilt Trip"" has little basis in reality a cultural familial or otherwise. There is something promising about the match-up of an old-school show-biz kid like Streisand with the modern anxiously self-aware Rogen but what could have been the multigenerational Thunderdome of Jewish Humor instead turns out bloodlessly disappointing.INTERACTIVE The Envelope Screening SeriesIts hard to believe that Streisand came back to a leading role after supporting parts in the last two ""Fockers"" movies so that she could participate in an agonizingly long and unfunny scene in which her character powers through a 50-ounce steak dinner so she can get it for free. (Because you know she loves a bargain etc.) A late story twist exists only to give Streisand a chance to go momentarily self-serious and verklempt.One could perhaps charitably remark that Streisand has a naturally at-ease screen presence at this point in her storied career (shes 70) yet the reality of her performance seems to be that she barely showed up. Say what you will about her mugging turns in 1970s comedies such as ""The Owl and the Pussycat"" and ""Whats Up Doc?"" a at least she was making an effort. This leaves Rogen straining harder than Anne Hathaway hosting the Oscars to keep things afloat; notably Rogens biggest laughs come in moments without Streisand. Other capable talents such as Casey Wilson Adam Scott and Ari Graynor have barely five minutes of screen time between them unable to offer real support.Directed by Anne Fletcher ""The Guilt Trip"" not only feels fake but looks it too sets appearing unabashedly as sets. One of the few points of interest in the film is trying to decide which car scenes were done with a towing rig and which were green-screen process shots. Just as one would on a long car ride during ""The Guilt Trip"" you look for excitement where you can.mark.olsenlatimes.com-------------------------------------------------------------The Guilt TripRatedA PG-13 for language and some risquA(c) materialRunning timeA 1 hour 36 minutesPlayingA In wide release PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO The making of Argo Les Miz and more The Envelope Awards Insider PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSeth Rogen joins Bieber bashers calls him ungrateful...March 13 2014Hobbit to again rule box office; Zero Dark Thirty has...December 20 20123-D Monsters Inc. should scare off Barbra Streisand...December 18 2012Barbra Streisand Seth Rogen on their Guilt Trip comedy...December 18 2012Les Miserables moves to Christmas DaySeptember 18 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webSeth RogenEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-guilt-trip-review-20121219,0,5507181.story",200,theguilttrip22,theguilttrip,latimes
"The Guilt Trip review More nags than gags | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Guilt Trip review More nags than gagsThe Guilt Trip is a formula comedy starring Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand as a mother and son on a road trip.Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand (plus hitchhiker Pedro Lopez) on a mother-son road trip.  (Sam Emerson / Paramount Pictures)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterTues. Dec. 18 2012 The Guilt Trip (out of 4) Starring Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen. Directed by Anne Fletcher. 96 minutes. Opens Dec. 19 at major theatres. PG The Guilt Trip is like getting rice pudding for dessert its sweet simple and will do when you cant get anything else. Canadian comic actor Seth Rogen plays it surprisingly low key as struggling science nerd inventor Andy Brewster who invites his perpetually nagging mother Joyce (Barbra Streisand looking mahvellous) along for an eight-day journey on the highway to hell. Joyce is the modern-day version of the classic Jewish nudge who proudly tells Andy her Pilates instructor is a lesbian in one of her multiple daily phone calls between grilling him on the reasons for his sorry lack of a girlfriend. Shes the kind who still says ""slacks"" and is devoted to upping her water consumption. Joyce is barely able to control her excitement that her big-shot California son is dropping in on his New Jersey mom before starting a cross-country sales trip to get his invention an eco-friendly spray cleaner into stores. Andy puts on his patient face and counts the hours until go time. But widowed Joyces confession of regret about a lost love prompts Andy to impulsively invite her to join him on the trip. Hell pitch the cleaner to big retail and -- big secret here -- help mom reconnect with that man that got away. The Guilt Trip is not so much a movie as a string of predictable TV sitcom gags that havent been in such heavy rotation since the 1970s a hitchhiker a strip club where nobody strips a creepy desk clerk and a book-on-disc with dirty parts. In between Andy makes a series of awkward pitches to companies. Hes no salesman but Andy would it kill you to shave? For Joyce who has only ever been to Florida this is the equivalent of the grand tour breakfast coupons accepted. Shes so proud of her baby boy who chafes at her constant input. Theres much missed opportunity here. Most of the dialogue feels like open-mic improv at a second-rate comedy club as Streisand and Rogen randomly lob softballs at each other without seeing if anything connects. The trip feels awkward for all the wrong reasons and far longer than 96 minutes. The bored can pass the time by doing mental math. Rogen is 30. Joyce hints she was in her early 20s when she had Andy. But shes really 70. Thats OK Babs looks barely 50 even in close-up. Its a miracle The best scene involves Streisand downing a hubcap-sized steak at a Texas eatery in order to get her meal free. In between bites she catches the eye of a handsome dude of a certain age who likes a gal with a good appetite. It reminds us that Streisand had a true flair for comic acting early in her career (Funny Girland as the trash-talking hooker in The Owl and The Pussycat). Where was director Anne Fletcher (Step Up 27 Dresses The Proposal) through all this random tomfoolery? Granted she was given little help from screenwriter Dan Fogelman (Crazy Stupid Love) who drew on a road trip from L.A. to Vegas he made with his own mom to pen his flaccid script. The resulting effort is predictable and pretty much laugh free although it earns a couple of chuckles and the kind of indulgent smiles reserved for well-behaved children. This is the kind of movie you can take your mom -- and grandmother -- to and nobody will feel awkward in the car on the way home. And if theyre Streisand fans The Guilt Trip will go down like a big tub of popcorn. With extra buttah.

Just then a younger studio executive jumps up from his chair and exclaims ""Ive got it We make a road-trip movie about a guy traveling from New Jersey to San Francisco with his overly affectionate high-maintenance Jewish mother And itll star Barbra Streisand and that lovable schlub from Knocked Up"" The VP begins weeping with joy. High fives are exchanged and designer water bottles are ceremoniously clinked together. Over in the corner someone starts minting money. Whether or not The Guilt Trip was conceived this way is of course debatable (palm-slapping may not have occurred). But Anne Fletchers familial farce leans on its simplistic premise and stunt casting so heavily that such market-research origins are plausible; youd swear you were actually watching a 95-minute pitch for a mild cross-generational cringe comedy rather the film itself. Once Rogens aspiring entrepreneur invites Ma along for a coast-to-coast ride every sitcomish beat is dutifully hit She infantilizes him; he mumbles smart-ass comments; uncomfortable sexual situations offer Freudian minefields and beaucoup embarrassment (bring on the mom-and-son strip-club visit) if little comic payoff. Whats surprising is that Rogen and Streisand have a genuinely complementary chemistry feeding off each other in a way that suggests that given a halfway decent script the two would make a better-than-decent screen duo. They should just develop an act and take that on the road.

B) They accept unambitious work-for-hire roles in mass-market family comedies about some combination of dogs weddings road trips Christmas or babies. This is often a prelude to cover features in Modern Maturity so its weird to see young Seth Rogen in such a broadly targeted family movie.In Anne Fletchers buddy comedy The Guilt Trip Rogen is Andy Brewster an organic chemist frustrated in his entrepreneurial efforts at selling the natural cleaning product he has invented. He comes home to New Jersey to visit his widowed mother Joyce played by Barbra Streisand. After she tells her son about a sweetheart with whom shed broken up to marry Andys father he Googles--wait actually GoogleBings which is weird--the guys name and finds his address in San Francisco. About to embark on a multicity sales jaunt he invites his mom along ostensibly to spend time with her but with the hidden agenda of hooking her up with the old boyfriend.Pairing Rogen and Streisand turns out to be inspired. The wisp of a plot serves as a platform for some strong comic dynamics the only semi-important thing the film has to offer other than a message of environmentally safe cleaning products and a huge shout-out to the National Cattlemens Beef Association. For an internationally famous doyenne who lives at a magnificent and heightened level of existence involving ambient harp glissandos and lilac fragrance Streisand offers a spot-on portrayal of a retired middle-class Gap aficionado. Andys multiple agendas and his own internal resistance to the fact that he kind of wants his moms help challenges his affable schlubbiness. Rogen and Streisand clearly like each other judging by the improvisational chemistry of their relationship and their exchanges have the quarrelsome affection of long acquaintance.Film Details The Guilt Trip RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time95 More Info The tight focus on the characters yields a narrative gentleness thats only surprising in a landscape of emphatic gross-out comedies some of which Rogen has written himself. The Guilt Trip tees up scenes involving an eating contest a strip club and a casino which in an overdetermined situational film would have resulted in projectile vomiting an embarrassing lap dance and hitting the big jackpot respectively. At each turn Dan Fogelmans script instead veers back to the filial relationship and the complications therein.If you do the math and assume that Joyce the character is the same age as Streisand then she gave birth to Andy at age 40 which means he dodged the whole chromosome-abnormality bullet for which women of advanced maternal age are at risk. Viewers prone to intrusive thoughts and the obsessive need to mentally justify every incongruity in a film can consider the broader societal trend toward older parenthood and also that Streisand looks pretty great for her age anyway. Plus acting If that doesnt help the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders contains helpful prescribing regimens that might alleviate your symptoms.

Its a dynamic weve seen everywhere from the novels of Philip Roth to Woody Allens ""Oedipus Wrecks"" and countless other movies and sitcoms over the last half-century or so. But ""The Guilt Trip"" starring gravelly voiced everyslacker Seth Rogen as the son and Barbra Streisand as the mom has its own agenda that goes far beyond cheek-pinching and boiled chicken. The movie directed by Anne Fletcher (""The Proposal"" ""27 Dresses"") from a script by Dan Fogelman (""Crazy Stupid Love"" ""Cars"") may occasionally err on the side of innocuousness but at least it explores actual facets of the mother-adult son relationship without veering into caricature. Young inventor Andrew Brewster (Rogen) at the end of his financial rope sets out on a cross-country road trip in an attempt to sell his organic cleaning product to one of the major retail chains. Flying to his home in New Jersey from L.A. he pays an all-too-rare visit to his mother Joyce (Streisand) who dotes on her son cross-country with a seemingly endless series of phone messages sharing everything from encouragement to tips on underwear sales at The Gap. During his visit Andrew tries to get Joyce to go to a singles mixer for older people but shes clearly not having it. That night she tells him about her first love a boy from Florida whom she loved passionately but who ultimately never proposed to her suggesting instead that she accept the offer from Andrews father. Andrew tracks the man down on Google finds him in San Francisco and suggests that Joyce accompany him on the trip mainly so he can attempt a reunion by the bay for his mom and the guy she never fully got over. In a cheesier movie the rest of the film would just be about overbearing Joyce getting on Andrews nerves in an enclosed space but ""The Guilt Trip"" goes in smarter directions than that whether its the two of them listening to the audiobook of Jeffrey Eugenides ""Middlesex"" (a constant source of discomfort for Andrew who feels awkward listening to discussion of genitals in his mothers presence) or Joyces attempts to help Andrew out with both his professional and romantic life. Viewers of a certain age will be thrilled to know that Joyces advice is right far more often than its wrong. In fact one of the films strengths is that both characters genuinely learn things from and about each other in ways that rarely feel contrived or phony. Mother-love tends to get a bad rap in pop culture but not here. Theres not a ton of plot granted but the real pleasure of the film comes from watching Rogen and Streisand (looking more loose and relaxed than shes appeared in any medium for some time) interact. I will always always laugh uproariously at ""Whats Up Doc?"" no matter how many times I see it so its been disappointing to see Streisand ignore her comedic roots for so long. (And lets not count the ""Fockers"" movies which did no ones funny bone any favors.) Her unflagging insistence and his laid-back withdrawal mesh perfectly; this is a comic duo that should keep working together. The movies also peppered with lots of great character actors who apparently agreed to glorified walk-ons just for the opportunity to spend a day with an icon like Streisand Keep an eye peeled for the likes of Kathy Najimy Adam Scott Casey Wilson Rose Abdoo Miriam Margolyes Colin Hanks Dale Dickey and Nora Dunn among others. (Special mention to Brett Cullen most recently seen in the ""Red Dawn"" remake as a soft-spoken Southwesterner smitten with Joyce and her skill at putting away a big steak dinner.) ""The Guilt Trip"" is too gentle to be uproarious (although no one makes a comment like ""This place smells like strawberry gum"" about a topless bar the way Streisand can) but if youre in the mood for something easygoing and well-acted its a sweet little character piece. Take your mom -- or at least call her. You know how she worries. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The chemistry between Rogen and Barbra Streisand in ""The Guilt Trip"" takes him from Judd Apatows vulgar stoner millennial to every mothers son in 95 minutes. As Andrew Brewster a nerdy inventor trying to pitch an organic cleaning product to store chains across the country with Mom riding shotgun Rogen at first comes off as a bit of a schlub whose social skills need serious polishing but his irrepressible charm is never far below the surface. As lovably overbearing mama Joyce a widow who trains her considerable energy on her only child and his unmarried state Streisand tones down the wackadoo and actually shows restraint fluttering French manicure and all. It is that restraint buoyed by Rogens effortless magnetism as her foil that keeps the movie from going over the guardrails. They both seem to be enjoying themselves and each other so much that even when a scene doesnt quite work -- like one in which Joyce gets drunk in a dive bar surrounded by leering rednecks -- you dont mind suspending disbelief. Other touches inlcuding Joyce insisting on listening to the books-on-tape version of Jeffrey Eugenides ""Middlesex"" in the rental car and the two of them musing about how long youre supposed to look at the Grand Canyon before you can move on add layering to gags that are sometimes too literal as when cost-conscious Joyce chokes down a four-pound steak in a Texas feedhall so she wont have to pay for it. When the pace drags now and then you can always focus on Babs. Wonder exactly where she managed to get her hair blown out at that truck stop and how in the heck she looks so good at 70. Seriously how does a woman of her age whos had work done avoid that Our Lady of Perpetual Surprise expression? ""The Guilt Trip"" knows its audience -- middle-aged and older women -- and for them its the entertainment equivalent of a good roadside-diner meal. No big belly laughs but quite a few chuckles.

"The Guilt Trip Review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Guilt Trip with a funny lady -- and son Barbra Streisand enlivens a formulaic family road picture with Seth RogenDecember 18 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticSeth Rogen and Barbra Streisand star in ""The Guilt Trip.""Well its a masterpiece compared with ""Little Fockers"" the last movie featuring Barbra Streisand.""The Guilt Trip"" stars Streisand and Seth Rogen as kvetchy mother and nudnik son in a rental car causing each other no little tsuris not to mention tsimmes as they drive cross-country learning a few life lessons per Dan Fogelmans clearly mapped screenplay.The plot points arrive like historical markers. And yet its a lot better than ""Little Fockers"" in which Streisand played a tiny supporting role. Its also better than the earlier ""Meet the Fockers."" In ""The Guilt Trip"" at least she has a chance to take over a scene and a movie.You getta lotta Barbra. And some Seth. And theyre fun together.In ""The Guilt Trip"" only her fifth screen actingjobin 20 years Streisand plays Joyce the long-widowed mother of sad-sack entrepreneur Andy (Rogen whose cheek was made for pinching). Theres a man on the other side of the country in San Francisco whom Joyce loved once upon a time before she met Andys father. Out of guilt and trace elements of affection Andy asks Joyce to accompany him on a work trip. Hes trying to sell an eco-friendly cleaning solution to various retailers; the secret mission however is to hook up Joyce with her former beau.So it goes directed with efficient proficiency by Anne Fletcher. The former choreographer directed ""27 Dresses"" and ""The Proposal"" neither of which was as easy to take as ""The Guilt Trip"" though both were less dire than ""Little Fockers."" For the record ""Little Fockers"" really wasnt funny at all. At all. At. All.Joyce drives Andy nuts by listening to the entirety of ""Middlesex"" on tape in the rental car. On a dare she consumes the dreaded 4 1/2-pound steak at a Texas steakhouse where she meets an eligible and interested bachelor (Brett Cullen). Joyce has some ideas regarding how to spice up nervous Andys sales pitches. Andy deflects; Joyce wheedles and needles.Some movies exist to be elevated by the performers theyre showcasing. This is one of them. The extended dialogue scenes Streisand shares with Rogen stay just this side of aggravating overstatement even when the characters themselves are meant to be aggravating each other. Did you happen to see the road trip comedy ""Due Date"" with Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis? That film was a headache -- sour and formulaic. ""The Guilt Trip"" somewhat against the odds is not a headache. Its formulaic but sweet in its way. My head felt fine coming out of it.

Special to Newsday + - Barbra Streisand as Joyce Brewster and Seth Rogen as Andrew Brewster in aramount Pictures and Skydance Productions The Guilt Trip. Photo Credit Paramount Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A man and his meddling mom take a cross-country road trip. BOTTOM LINE Rogen and Streisand have their moments but not a movies worth. CAST Seth Rogen Barbra Streisand LENGTH 135 Albert Brooks 1996 ""Mother"" took the idea of a well-meaning overbearing matriarch to places of squirm-inducing embarrassment and insight leaving plenty of room for a lighter more sitcomy version of the story about a man spending concentrated time with his mom. As the umbilically bound twosome in director Anne Fletchers effort stars and executive producers Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand share a believable family connection -- Babs is actually so adorable you want to hug her if only to shut her up. Yet despite some funny offhand moments ""The Guilt Trip"" doesnt jell. I almost feel guilty for saying that. Biochemist Andy Brewster (Rogen) has spent three years perfecting an all-natural ""scientific"" cleaning product he has maladroitly dubbed Scieoclean. The clunky name says exactly how Andy sees the world. Utterly convinced of his irrefutable reason and logic hes equally misguided about his long-widowed mothers singlehood -- and certain that a surprise reunion with the lost love of her youth will complete her lifes equation. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Believing hes found the man -- an advertising executive in San Francisco -- Andy impulsively invites mom Joyce (Streisand) along with him on a scheduled road trip to visit the headquarters of retailers like Kmart and Costco where he has appointments to pitch his product. Setting out from New Jersey the familial odd couple treks to Virginia Tennessee Texas and Las Vegas as strained patience gives way to ugly comments give way to ... well you dont need a GPS to see where this trips going. Screenwriter Dan Fogelman (""Crazy Stupid Love"") based the film on a real-life cross-country drive to Vegas with his own mom also named Joyce. But you get the feeling including from the end-credit outtakes that some of the best lines came spontaneously from Rogens well-known talent for improvisation. That leaves a plot structure in which the inevitable hard-truths scene feels early and unearned. And incidents from Fogelmans real-life trip diary might have been more interesting in real life. PLOT A man and his meddling mom take a cross-country road trip. 232 VideoTrailer The Guilt Trip CAST Seth Rogen Barbra Streisand advertisement | advertise on newsday LENGTH 135 PLAYING AT Area theaters BOTTOM LINE Rogen and Streisand have their moments but not a movies worth.

Well okay not exactly eat him but certainly chew at him smother him baby him and generally enact an encyclopedia of neurotic behaviors that have come to represent a devouring guilt-inducing Jewish mother in broad comedies such as this one never mind that there is no factual confirmation that Joyce is a certified Jewish mother. The movie is one big feh. The ""action"" is a collection of pit-stop-to-pit-stop set pieces (a cheap motel the Grand Canyon a Vegas casino) interspersed with mother-and-son-in-a-car scenes. Rogen emits his instantly recognizable hiccup cackle of a laugh and sucks his lip a lot in the manner of a grown man who would if he werent behind the wheel roll his eyes back in his head at his mothers nudnik noodginess. But The Guilt Trip is not about Rogen bubbeleh. Streisand is her own once-in-a-lifetime trip looking gawjuss with that divine voice and those killer fingernails and the sight of the lady scarfing down four pounds of beef at a Texas steak joint is one a Streisand lover can now cross off her bucket list.

TWITTER Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen star in a mother-son road-trip comedy from director Anne Fletcher (""The Proposal""). Yentl goes yenta in The Guilt Trip a creakily old-fashioned comedy that forgot to pack the laughs along with the nudging and kvetching. Possibly the first American film in decades in which characters drive cross-country courtesy of process shots out the back window this mother-son yakfest blows a gasket and all four tires before it even hits the road. With Seth Rogen in very subdued mode his fans will smell this one a mile away; it might be a movie only their mothers -- or die-hard Barbra Streisand fans -- could love. When was the last time an overbearing Jewish mother giving her schlemiel of a son a hard time about not being married was a major component of a big Hollywood film? This sort of routine used to pop up all the time in American comedy but pretty much has vanished in the rearview mirror since the heyday of Ruth Gordon. So to behold Streisands New York mom Joyce Brewster hectoring her homely visiting son Andrew (Rogen) about his myriad personal shortcomings is to revisit a musty mind-set that the minor updates in Dan Fogelmans woeful script cant begin to freshen up. VIDEO The Guilt Trip Trailer Barbra Streisand Drives Seth Rogen Crazy The early scenes of Andrews return from California to his childhood home are so embarrassing that you wonder if such impressive consistency can possibly be sustained. Andrew knows what hes in for but that still doesnt help when Mom immediately starts in asking what happened to former girlfriends X Y and Z complaining that he went to UCLA just to get as far away from her as possible pointing out that she hasnt had a date since her husbands long-ago death and then recommending that Andrew get therapy. Enough already. In an effort to connect with Andrew Joyce unloads what she considers a bombshell of a secret She actually had a boyfriend before she met her husband and loved him so much she named her only son after him. Considering it odd she never tried to look him up after his dad died Andrew does research that reveals hes an executive in San Francisco. With an ulterior motive in mind he invites Mom to join him on a drive across the country during which hell make stops in Virginia Texas Santa Fe and Las Vegas to hawk a nontoxic cleansing liquid product he has created to potential retailers. These pitch sessions are desultory affairs -- a salesman Andrew is not -- and Joyce doesnt help matters by hovering and carrying on in ways that scarcely help her sons cause. To save a few bucks she insists they rent a compact rather than an SUV forcing them to share very close quarters as they listen to Jeffrey Eugenides gender-bending Middlesex on CD. The way Joyce gets excited about gift shops and free continental breakfasts at motels (where she insists they stay in one room to save more money) youd think shed never been out of New York before. In terms of viewer relief from the constant haranguing getting on the road held out the hope of changing scenery and a possible parade of lively supporting roles. Instead we get process shots of the two leads crammed into the tiny car intercut with second unit coverage of highways and the countryside. They do get out of the car to look at the Grand Canyon but after about five seconds they decide theyve seen enough and move on to Vegas which Joyce actually likes. The one stop that at least yields something different is at a Texas steakhouse where anyone who can eat a 4 1/2-pound steak and all the trimmings in one hour gets it for free. Uncharacteristically Joyce volunteers launching a gorge-fest that at least presents the half-amusing spectacle of Streisand pigging out and wins Joyce an admirer in the form of a handsome older gent (the indisputably handsome Brett Cullen) whod like to have her come up and see him sometime. The climactic visit to San Francisco to track down Joyces former beau predictably plays on and aims to stimulate bittersweet emotions. At the same time the easy-to-get point of the enterprise is to stress that the mother and sons prolonged time together has forced them to break through their various barriers grudges and expectations to arrive at a more honest satisfying relationship. Yep thatll do the trick every time. CONCERT REVIEW Barbra Streisand in Brooklyn The Guilt Trip provides heavy competition with director Anne Fletchers previous films (Step Up 27 Dresses The Proposal) as to which is the most formulaic and conventional but this one takes the cake for being the most visually unimaginative and clunky. Worse even the most easy-to-please audiences will struggle to find more than a half-dozen laughs here so bereft is the film of fresh comic ideas. Rogen -- who for some reason sports about a one-days grizzle of beard throughout -- drastically underplays probably realizing that with Streisand emoting so broadly it was the only way to go. For her part some combination of cosmetic expertise cinematic enhancement and natural endowment makes Streisand look more like shes in her 50s than in her 70s which is the actuality. Those whove always liked the singer-actress probably wont mind her here; for the nonfan this is not the film that will change your mind. A retinue of terrific character actors could have greatly enlivened the proceedings but Fogelman (Cars Bolt Tangled Crazy Stupid Love) didnt write the parts for them.

Pairing Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen as a neurotic New Jersey mother-son odd couple then sending the two on a road trip through Texas and the South Anne Fletchers ""The Guilt Trip"" would seem to have uncovered some rarely tapped veins of Oedipal and culture-clash comedy. Yet the film scarcely bothers to mine them making for a timid modestly pleasant time-passer distinguished mostly by its unexplored potential. All the same the attraction of seeing Streisand in her first non-""Fockers"" role in more than a decade as well as the general dearth of grandma-friendly comedies should generate healthy holiday weekend business. Dialing down his zaniness if not his volume Rogen plays Andy a permanently flustered Los Angeles-based organic chemist whos ready to launch his years-in-the-making invention a cleaning product whose easily mispronounced name (Scioclean) poses the first of his many problems in pitching it to wholesalers. As a last-ditch marketing ploy Andy plots a weeklong road trip to hawk his wares at company HQs across the country starting with his hometown in New Jersey. While there he stops to visit his loquacious long-widowed mother Joyce (Streisand). Displaying all the general tendencies of a stereotypical Jewish mother with none of the cultural specifics the overprotective oversharing Joyce is allegedly responsible for Andys adult neuroses though we rarely see her venture beyond typical motherly meddling. In any case Andy whines through the visit until hes about to head off when he abruptly finds himself moved by his mothers loneliness and revelations of a long-ago lost love and invites her along for the journey. Perhaps the biggest problem here is that ""The Guilt Trip"" is one of the most homebound road movies in recent memory mostly alternating between motel rooms and cramped car seats with little sense of forward momentum. When Dan Fogelmans script does pause to build up a potential setpiece -- dropping the twosome into a snowstorm a steakhouse eating competition or Andys ex-girlfriends house -- it tends to lose its nerve and simply moves on never nudging its characters far enough past the borders of propriety to generate real laughs. In particular to include a scene in which Streisand and Rogen are stranded at a strip club for hours without even attempting a joke at its expense should be a cinematic crime. Helmer Anne Fletcher (""The Proposal"" ""27 Dresses"") does achieve some genuine moments of warmth and Streisand is consistently adorable in her tastefully dowdy duds conveying the requisite amount of Babsiness without getting too fabulous for the character. Rogen for his part never quite finds the right rhythm for Andy and often veers toward one-note irritation although his disastrous pitch meetings eventually allow him the freedom to unleash his bellowing frustrations. (The film is chockablock with product placements but these recurring pitch scenes provide some particularly canny plot-friendly uses allowing real-life companies -- K-Mart Orchard Costco et al. -- to decline Andys invention by referencing the high standards of the many fine products they already offer. The shamelessness is almost admirable.) A two-hander through and through the pic carves out some moderate breathing room for Brett Cullen as a handsome Texan suitor and Kathy Najimy as a Jersey housewife though most other characters are strictly relegated to scenery. Technical specs are all suitably professional if never particularly distinguished.
