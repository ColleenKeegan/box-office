Toni Braxton hangs with the Oogieloves who star in the childrens film that goes on way too long to keep its target audience engaged. Photo Matthew Mitchell Oogieloves in The Big Balloon Adventure review 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure Family. Directed by Matthew Diamond. (G. 88 minutes.) ""The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure"" is the title so we can be confident that balloons are involved. And an adventure - a big one. But what pray tell is an Oogielove? An Oogielove is a member of a new nonhuman species of movie character forcefully cute outfitted in colorful fabric and expressly designed for young uns in the manner of ""Barney"" or ""Teletubbies."" They all live in Lovelyloveville with a magic window named Windy a vacuum cleaner named J. Edgar (as in Hoover people) and an infantile pink pillow named Schluufy who sleeps all the time. We meet three Oogieloves Toofie a purple boy-Oogie; Zoozie a yellow girl-Oogie; and Goobie a green nerdboy-Oogie. Goobie boasts a large vocabulary which is good because the rest of the dialogue consists largely of ""Oogie"" ""snap"" and ""Toofie pick up your pants"" ""The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure"" was directed by Matthew Diamond a choreographer whos helmed quite a few episodes of ""So You Think You Can Dance"" and written by Scott Stabile who previously worked on the thwarted-criminal documentary series ""I (Almost) Got Away with It."" The movies resemblance to ""Teletubbies"" is not accidental as ""Oogieloves"" producer Kenn Viselman helped bring that show to American screens in the late 1990s. Viselmans idea this time was to create an interactive feature film that explodes the proverbial fourth wall and encourages wee ones to sing shout get up and dance. The target demographic is encouraged to ""wobble bobble all around and give your tush a smack."" The children who watched this with me - 2-year-old Ryan 5-year-old Imre and 7-year-old Ursi - did no such thing. No wobbling no bobbling no tush-smacking. Instead they sat quietly munching on cherries and cheese doodles and seeming mildly entertained as the three Oogieloves started off on their quest to retrieve five magic gold balloons for Schluufys birthday party. Ursi and Imre liked the film but reported zero interest in seeing it again. Ryan enjoyed ""Oogieloves"" more than the others but bailed after a half hour which seems to be the max for tots watching escapades rendered in felt. As his dad observed the whole thing runs about an hour too long It should have been a TV show. The adventures too big for the kids who would love it the most. Amy Biancolli is a Hearst movie writer.

Photo Credit Handout advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Three fuzzy friends go searching for five magic balloons. BOTTOM LINE Its 100 percent kid-friendly and cutesy-wutesy but adult brains will turn to mush within minutes. CAST Toni Braxton Cloris Leachman Chazz Palminteri LENGTH 123 Good news parents The MPAA rating for ""The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure"" is what you might call a hard G always sweet never scary and free of crude humor. The bad news at least for you is that its nearly as insipid and mind-numbing as the television show that inspired it ""Teletubbies."" Produced by Kenn Viselman who imported the massively successful ""Teletubbies"" and ""Thomas the Tank Engine amp; Friends"" series from England ""The Oogieloves"" is presented as a new kind of interactive movie experience with on-screen cues encouraging children to sing dance and chant. (Viselman claims he got the idea while sitting among a raucous crowd at a Tyler Perry movie.) Well thats another plus for this movie No shushing necessary. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? Late nights convention takes Who did it best? If only there were something on screen to keep your adult brain from dissolving into strained peas. Three actors in bigheaded fuzzy-wuzzy costumes play Goobie (brainy bespectacled) Zoozie (girlish pigtailed) and Toofie (rowdy sloppy) who are preparing a birthday surprise for their favorite throw pillow Schluufy (babbling immobile). But theyve lost their five magic balloons somewhere in Lovelyloveville Can you help find them? ""The Oogieloves"" like the much-criticized ""Teletubbies"" isnt educational (there is some counting) and barely qualifies as entertaining; its merely eye-occupying like a spinning mobile or a blowing curtain. It also looks rather cheap and feels hastily conceived with a random grab bag of guest stars playing tossed-off characters like circle-obsessed Dotty Rounder (Cloris Leachman) sneezing diva Rosalie Rosebud (Toni Braxton) and jive-talking soda jerk Milky Marvin (a fairly entertaining Chazz Palminteri). The films one clever joke is a talking vacuum named J. Edgar -- get it? Filmed if not quite directed by Matthew Diamond ""The Oogieloves"" unfolds with a disjointed dream logic that may resonate with its target audience. The downside is that youll have to sit through it too. PLOT Three fuzzy friends go searching for five magic balloons.

A prime contender for most peculiar wide release of the year ""The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure"" reps a passion project in childrens entertainment for producer Kenn Viselman (""Teletubbies""). Designed to get young viewers out of their seats singing dancing jumping and shouting at the screen this exhausting ""interactive"" pic charts the quest of three candy-colored creatures to retrieve five magic balloons as a birthday surprise for their slumberous pillow pal Schluffy. Filmed over four days in 2009 and only now hitting theaters through Viselmans self-distribution chutzpah this unknown commodity faces an uphill challenge luring moppets and parents into theaters. The simple plot serves as an excuse to string together kid-friendly production numbers for 10 original songs; conceivably that should play to the strengths of director Matthew Diamond whose credits include numerous televised musical-theater specials and Disneys ""Camp Rock."" Instead the low-budget production feels chintzy and impossibly square even by tyke standards. Six ""name"" celebrities pop up for single-sequence cameos each gamely involved in a song-and-dance number. Supposedly Viselman has two additional ""Oogieloves"" adventures in the works but its unlikely anyone leaves this one clamoring for more.

They set up the rules of the Oogieloves experience When you see the butterflies flitter around the screen feel free to jump up dance around and join the fun. When the turtles make their way across the screen return to your seats. And then they are off fully immersing the viewers in the colorful and silly world of Lovelyloveville. The Oogieloves are planning a party for their friend Schluffy a pillow. But the magical balloons they got for him are accidentally released and they must go collect them. And kids are invited along for the adventure where they meet interesting characters such as Toni Braxton as a rose-obssessed/rose-allergic diva Chazz Palminteri as an Elvis-like shake shop owner and Cloris Leachman as a circle-loving grandma living in a tree. There are no villains in this movie but theres lots of suspense and problem solving involved in retrieving the balloons. There are points early on when the movie feels like a TV show (the producers pedigree includes Teletubbies and Thomas the Tank Engine) but that can be a good thing for kids as the pacing is familiar. Though clocking in at 83 minutes it may be a tad too long and the last 15 minutes seem to drag out. The call-and-response strategy works very well to engage young children and the silly songs are sure to stick in your head. Parents who have had to sit through a myriad of mindless kids movies will appreciate a chance for their kids to be themselves at the theater and to be silly right alongside them. On the whole it can serve as a good introduction to the movie-going experience.

"First there was Teletubbies now Oogieloves - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate First there was Teletubbies now Oogieloves Share Tweet Share Tweet Toofie one of the live-action pals in ""The Big Balloon Adventure."" Matthew Mitchell By Loren King Globe Correspondent | 08.28.12 | 602 PM If ""The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure"" were a half-hour Saturday morning TV show it would be a scary enough proposition for most parents. Seeing it as a feature-length big-screen movie its like paying to watch a dumbed-down mash-up of the least creative parts of ""Teletubbies"" ""Barney amp; Friends"" and ""Pee-wees Playhouse."" Will your preschoolers enjoy it? Perhaps. Is it worth 88 minutes of their lives or yours? Not in a world where ""Sesame Street"" is on TV every day. Not even in a world where ""Sesame Street"" didnt exist. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters ""The Oogieloves"" gives us Goobie Zoozie and Toofie three oversize plush garishly colored live-action pals who open the movie by telling the audience to stand up and dance whenever butterflies float across the screen (and to sit when turtles follow). There are other moments designed to engage the kids Whenever Toofies too-big jeans fall down which is several times too often the Oogieloves urge the audience to yell ""Goofy Toofie pick up your pants"" The kids at a recent screening obliged but it seemed more obligatory -- you will have fun -- than spontaneous. And whats the value of urging interaction in a public setting rather than at home? Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The ""adventure"" follows the Oogie-loves in search of five errant gold Mylar balloons needed for their friend Schluufys birthday. Schluufy is a pink pillow that spends much of the movie asleep on a couch. Their other friends J. Edgar (a red upright vacuum cleaner . . . dont go there) and Windy Window (a Southern belle whose sparkly disembodied face peers into the Oogieloves house) provide directions on the balloons whereabouts. The plush pals then ride their tricycles around crayon-colored Lovelyloveville carting around Ruffy a fish stuffed into a too small dry fishbowl. Among the adult characters they meet are polka-dot loving treehouse dweller Dotty Rounder (Cloris Leachman); Marvin Milkshake (Chazz Palminteri) a soda jerk who leads the gang in a ""Milkshake March and Moo""; a grinning cowboy named Bobby Wobbly (Cary Elwes) who is the most manic of the lot; and Rosalie Rosebud (Toni Braxton) a diva who sings an ode to her allergies. That song ""Ode to Adelaide (The Scratchy Sneezy Cough Cough Cough Song)"" is backed by the Oogie-loves and is one of the movies many ditties that would not be out of place at an elementary school talent show. Maybe its all harmless enough. But who needs a ""Teletubbies"" retread? Oogieloves is the creation of producer Kenn Viselman the Newton native who handled the US marketing and licensing of ""Teletubbies"" and another British import ""Thomas the Tank Engine amp; Friends."" Ooglieloves seems so intent on getting toddlers to love it -- and no doubt the merchandise thats sure to follow -- that such details as an engaging story line and originality seem to have gotten lost in Lovelyloveville.

The indulgent pace by director Matthew Diamond seems a tad too even-handed among the five parts. I confess to some squirming during Cary Elwes seasick-inducing turn as Bobby Wobbly and longing for a little more singing and less sniffling from Toni Braxtons allergic flower-loving diva Rosalie Rosebud.My fave? Chazz Palminteri as Milky Marvin the Elvis-wannabe milkshake shop owner whose Milkshake-Making Cow can make milkshakes out of absolutely anything.
