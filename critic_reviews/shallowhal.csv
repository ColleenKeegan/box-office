The Farrelly brothers latest sees the team tapping a sweeter milder vein of humor than their outrageous norm one defined by an overriding good-hearted moral. For a romantic comedy about seeing beyond fat to a persons inner beauty ""Shallow Hal"" could use a little extra comic poundage. The Farrelly brothers latest sees the team tapping a sweeter milder vein of humor than their outrageous norm one defined by an overriding good-hearted moral and goosed by the far-flung notion of Gwyneth Paltrow playing an obese young lady whose svelte charms only Jack Black can see. Although its low on hefty laughs and the PG-13 rating wont thrill the Farrellys old core audience of gross-out seeking teens Fox release has enough amusing and endearing moments to put it over as a reasonably commercial date movie before the holiday blockbusters move in. In addition to repping a change of pace for the Farrellys ""Hal"" marks a significant departure for Paltrow away from her status as the tony Miramax house actress and into a thoroughly mainstream low- to middlebrow starring vehicle. With platinum blond hair and an accentuated figure even in her non-tubby incarnation this is a different Paltrow one with a more generic and less distinguished look. Pic also provides Black with his first starring role after his breakthrough supporting turn in ""High Fidelity."" Amazingly after five films the Farrellys have not progressed one iota in the realm of technique; their filmmaking skills remain as rudimentary as they were on ""Dumb and Dumber"" seven years ago. When the comic situations and gags are just flat-out hilarious as they often have been in the brothers work the stylistic roughness doesnt much matter. In this film however with the relatively untested Black coming on awfully strong the lack of directorial finesse lets the enterprise down creating some clunky scenes and dead air where laughs might have been expected. A very ""Shrek""-like tale in its view of physical compatibility script by Sean Moynihan and the Farrellys proposes Blacks Hal and his vulgar buddy Mauricio (Jason Alexander) as two dubious overweight Lotharios who ineptly play the club circuit but still wont consider dating any woman whos not supermodel-beautiful. Mauricio who wears a toupee that looks like black Astroturf is so picky that he breaks up with his latest hottie because of her overlong second toe. Hal after being told by co-workers that he always aims out of his league takes advantage of a stuck-elevator encounter with self-help motivator Tony Robbins to come under a ""spell"" that allows him to see whats inside women rather than judging them on the basis of appearance only. Right away Hals outlook on life picks up and his effect on the ladies with it. A beautiful blonde with whom he shares a taxi gives him her number and three sizzling club dollies all but take him hostage. But when we see these same women from Mauricios p.o.v. the gag is revealed Those Hal sees as gorgeous and without flaws are actually dogs of the first order -- rotund unkempt uncouth and in urgent need of dental work. Then he meets Rosemary (Paltrow). Although shes first glimpsed in an apparel store examining panties that look custom made for a sumo wrestler Hal comes on to her complimenting her as if she were as slim as the Paltrow Hal and we see. Grateful for the attention but suspicious of being admired for qualities she knows she lacks Rosemary whos heavy enough to repeatedly break restaurant chairs shes sitting upon warily allows Hal to court her and both are surprised when they realize that she is Hals boss daughter. Much of the early going feels labored and curiously mirthless considering the ease with which the Farrellys have generated laughs in the past. Part of this could be attributed to overconfidence in the uproariousness of the central conceit and to some degree it stems from overkill by Black and Alexander both of whom push past the red line in playing aggressive over-compensators; at such energy levels a little of each of them goes a long way. Although pic like ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" last year is overlong at nearly two hours action picks up and develops increased cohesiveness in the second half. While Rosemarys father Steve Shanahan (""Analyze This"" tough guy Joe Viterelli sporting a delightfully thick Irish brogue) is highly skeptical of Hals motives hes won over by the young mans sincerity and is so taken with his business ideas that he promotes him at the investment firm. But all goes awry when Mauricio frantic over his best friends myopia tracks down Robbins and convinces him that Hal needs to be dehypnotized for his own good. So when Hal finally realizes what his beloved actually looks like he temporarily heads for the hills much to Rosemarys distress until the predictably public apology and reconciliation send everyone home happy. Almost as an afterthought the Farrellys toss in a couple of moderate gross-outs late in the game notably one involving an unusual appendage of Mauricios. And while there are plenty of references to fat physical attributes and lack of same they are notably not mean-spirited or derisive; hell Rosemary even works in a hospital for children who need special care and one of the main supporting roles is played by an amazing chap named Rene Kirby whose drastic spinal condition called spina bifida forces him to get around on all fours but who is amazingly spirited and is even shown to be an expert skier. With his stocky working class demeanor Black has a regular guy image that reps a good change of pace for a leading man. But the actors brazen glibness is relentless and scarcely modulated which proves too much in the long run and doesnt yield to a display of vulnerability that would match that provided by Paltrows Rosemary. Actress catches the characters shy sense of disbelief at being wooed so enthusiastically and at the end is able to express -- through layers of mountainous makeup -- the heartbreak and residual hope she feels about her first romance. Many student films boast better technical and aesthetic qualities than this one does but the Farrellys make their usual sprightly use of pop songs.

Consider this At one point in this movie one character says to another ""I hope you like bean dip."" And thats that. No gross humor no discussion of bodily functions nothing except somebody sincerely hoping that someone else likes bean dip. Hello -- is this a Farrelly movie? Even worse ""Shallow Hal"" involves its main character learning an Important Life Lesson and Becoming a Better Man. This is tolerable from some directors (although not many) but certainly not from the men who brought new meaning to the words ""hair gel."" ""Shallow Hal"" 1/2 With Gwyneth Paltrow Jack Black Jason Alexander Joe Viterelli Rene Kirby Susan Ward. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly from a screenplay by Sean Moynihan Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly. 113 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual content. Several theaters. In ""Shallow Hal"" we meet the title character (Jack Black sporting absurd sideburns) a very shallow guy indeed who is hypnotized by self-help guru Tony Robbins (playing himself rather puzzlingly -- does he really need the money?) and suddenly able to see inner beauty. Enter Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) a very heavy young woman who is visible to Hal -- but only Hal -- as slender and gorgeous. Hals quickly smitten to the consternation of his best pal Mauricio (Jason Alexander in a hideous rug). In early ads and trailers for ""Shallow Hal"" it all looked like a lengthy fat joke with shots of Paltrow (or a double) in a fat suit eliciting laughs from audiences. The movie however bends over backward to be inoffensive Its message of seeing inner beauty is a perfectly nice one and Rosemary (buoyed by a surprisingly sweet gentle performance from Paltrow) is a lovely character toward whom the audience immediately feels protective. But the problems here are twofold a) All this sweet inoffensive stuff is actually pretty boring (and out of the range of Black whose eyebrow-waggling shtick is better suited to comic-sidekick roles); and b) The Farrellys cant quite stick to it. A certain mean-spiritedness keeps peeking through with poor Rosemary always breaking chairs in restaurants or chowing down on enormous meals or displaying really big underwear. This is funny (well its supposed to be funny) because its the model-thin Paltrow who we see. Played by an overweight actress the scenes would have a decidedly nasty flavor. ""Shallow Hal"" presses home the message that its the heart of a person that counts not the exterior. But if thats the case why is every slightly odd-looking person in the movie used as a target for laughs? And why is the physical definition of beauty in the film such a limited one? And is it really true that only unattractive people join the Peace Corps? ""Shallow Hal"" certainly cant support the weight of these questions but pondering them helped me pass the time while waiting for the comedy that never came.

Starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jack Black. Co-written (with Sean Moynihan) and directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly. (PG-13. At Bay Area theaters. 113 minutes.) Inside every thin comedy is a fat one trying to get out. It takes a while for the Farrelly brothers to crank up ""Shallow Hal"" their comic fable about inner beauty but the belly laughs finally start to come -- legitimately. Like Rosemary the 300-pound heroine played by Gwyneth Paltrow this comedy has its cake and eats it too. It gets away with fat jokes at the same time it seems to be on the side of the angels and inner beauty. Fortunately theres more to it than that. For sure the movie has a stealth missile -- Paltrow glowing inside a fat suit -- but that goes only so far in explaining what makes ""Shallow Hal"" finally work as well as it does. What the Farrellys really want us to do is stop ducking the obvious accept the world for what it is and keep laughing at it anyway. People shouldnt worry their pretty little heads over finding euphemisms. This is tough-minded and comes from a genuine comic spirit. As Hal an aging frat boy who only goes for a girls looks Jack Black tones down his party-animal act and negotiates some tricky emotional turns. Both he and Jason Alexander as woman-chasing buddy Mauricio require some patience to see where theyre headed with this. They get a big boost from of all people Tony Robbins himself. And playing himself. When Hal is trapped in an elevator with Robbins the toothy motivational guru nails this crass skirt-chaser and hypnotizes him out of it. As far as beauty goes Robbins tells Hal ""From this moment on youre only going to see whats inside."" Robbins also jolts ""Shallow Hal"" to life with its first big laugh. Anyone who has caught Robbins on his infomercials already knows hes a good actor. From this point on its fun to see how cannily the Farrellys reveal their hand. Hal falls for the inner beauty of obese Rosemary (Paltrow) but what he ""sees"" is a lithe woman. At first it may look like a cheap trick but its actually smart. The fat jokes are only at the expense of a lissome glamour girl. The beauty part however is that it allows the Farrellys to raise the subject and they will add to it layer by layer like the fat suit. Paltrow is a marvel. At times the thin actress seems already to inhabit the space the fat suit will take up. No shrinking violet Rosemary stands up for herself as women her size must learn to do but she also has the slight hesitancy of someone never quite comfortable with herself or completely able to hide her insecurity. Shes shyly surprised that Hal is paying so much attention to her. How will Hal behave when he comes out of his trance? It can only be a matter of time before he sees Rosemary as she actually is -- and the audience sees the fat suit. Before that happens we get glimpses of cellulite and double chins. In their films (""Theres Something About Mary"" ""Me Myself and Irene"") the Farrellys have always said its OK to laugh at people who are ""different"" -- the mentally retarded the deformed the disabled. Dont pussyfoot around. Treat them like regular folks. In ""Shallow Hal"" the subjects are not only the fat but also the plain and sometimes the plain ugly. Having permission to laugh at people who are different endorses their humanity. This is quite another matter from the mealymouthed ""I wasnt laughing at them I was laughing with them."" It also frees us to criticize too. One of the nonprofessional actors is Rene Kirby a muscular man with a spinal deformity who walks on all fours. It is a relief to be able to complain that Kirby walking on his hands sometimes goes a little too far trying to show what a regular guy he is (although he does toss off a neat joke about latex gloves). I would have liked it even better if the script didnt go out of its way to explain what spina bifida is and just have the guy show up as a natural part of the scene. Having set all this up ""Shallow Hals"" got to be funny too. It would be pointless reverse-PC if they didnt come up with the laughs and for a while it looks as if were in trouble. Tenacious Ds Black (""High Fidelity"") in the title role actually underplays Hals obtuseness with women which turns out to be welcome. There are a couple of really sharp verbal zingers as well as some visual surprises that keep the audience guessing. There is some well- earned sentiment too. And after a sluggish start that makes it seem as if Alexander will never stop recycling George Costanza he finally gets funny. He has the movies funniest sight gag and its not his hairpiece which is too strange looking to be accidental. Advisory This film contains profanity.

By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- The new comedy from the Farrelly brothers ""Shallow Hal"" is a one joke pony and they ride this babys high concept right into the ground. Hal Larson [Jack Black best known for his role in ""High Fidelity"" (2000)] is so shallow he could go deep sea fishing in pond scum. In a word Hal is a dog. Despite the fact that Hal is desperately lacking in the looks department he insists on hitting only on supermodels and centerfolds. Needless to say hes less than successful. The only person more pitiful than Hal is his pudgy balding best friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander). Mauricio wears sprayed-on hair and is the last living man still wearing a Members Only jacket. He might as well have ""loser"" tattooed on his forehead. This pitiful pair spend all their free time trying to pick up gorgeous women at single clubs and bars. Of course they strike out more often than the Montreal Expos. Then one day Hal meets self-help guru Tony Robbins (playing himself). Robbins points out that Hal is looking for love in all the wrong places. He says Hal needs to see the inner beauty of the fairer sex. So presto change-o Robbins practices a little hypnosis on the hypercritical Hal. Now all Hal sees is that aforementioned inner beauty. Suddenly Hal is getting lucky everywhere he goes. Women are all over him. But unbeknownst to Hal hes getting lucky only because hes now batting in a new ball club. Hes approaching women with less than stellar looks and theyre so grateful for the attention that theyre falling all over themselves to get to him. Hes in hog heaven. Literally. While the world and Mauricio are seeing unattractive women with bad skin stringy hair and excess poundage Hal is seeing beauty. Much to Mauricios horror Hal is now dating women who are actually in his league. Hal is ecstatic. Mauricio is appalled. At this point enter Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) an extremely overweight Peace Corps volunteer. Rosemary is under no illusions about her weight so shes somewhat confused over Hals attention. When he guesses her weight at about 110 pounds she wants to know which butt cheek hes referring to. Here is the films main conceit -- the audience and Hal see Gwyneth as she really is with only an occasional glimpse of her in a fat suit. Yes folks real beauty is not only skin deep -- it can reach through two-and-a-half feet of fat. Many overweight people might find it hard to get the joke here but the Farrelly brothers insist theyre not making fun of fat people in this film an assertion some will find hard to swallow. Now the film goes into a full ""boy finds girl boy loses girl"" mode as Mauricio tracks down Robbins and gets him to give him the secret phrase that will bring Hal out of his hypnotic state. Faster than you can say Jenny Craig Hal is relieved of his illusions and begins to avoid Rosemary. Of course he discovers that he really does love her fat and all and the film concludes with his desperate efforts to win her back. Light and fluffy -- pun intended -- ""Shallow Hal"" is amusing at times. Paltrow Black and Alexander all hit their marks and deliver perfect comedic timing. But as is often the case if youve seen the trailer youve seen the best of the movie and there isnt really that much good stuff to go around. ""Shallow Hal"" opens nationwide on Friday November 9 and is rated PG-13.

"USATODAY.com - Shallow sentiment weighs down Hal Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 11/08/2001 - Updated 0457 PM ET Shallow sentiment weighs down Hal By Mike Clark USA TODAY Shallow Hal (out of four) Stars Gwyneth Paltrow Jack Black Jason Alexander Joe Vitarelli Rene Kirby Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for language and sexual content Farrelly brothers Bobby and Peter have such a latent sentimental streak that they even found a way to indulge it in Theres Something About Mary. Now they are going warm and fuzzy again in the ankle-deep amuser Shallow Hal. Well its hardly the worst thing that could happen after the ubiquitous Hal trailer promises an offensive poke at the obese. No one needs that. Yet there are times in this tepid farce when you think a special ""feelings"" consultant -- say the recently retired Mr. Rogers -- must have been hired on. In a leap to movie leads -- after all but stealing High Fidelity from John Cusack -- Jack Black (not exactly svelte himself) plays an investment-house employee interested only in outwardly physical beauties when he hits the clubs with another self-deludingly portly buddy (Jason Alexander). The movie is shrewd by giving the bulk of its piggish dialogue to Alexander an actor incapable of projecting genuine cruelty on screen. In a fleeting dash of inspiration Black meets real-life motivational speaker Tony Robbins in a stalled elevator. The self-help guru gives his impromptu student a pep talk then casts him under a spell after which Black can see only the so-called inner beauty of physically unattractive women. When Black subsequently meets a blonde (Gwyneth Paltrow) in a department store she looks Paltrow-pretty to him even though shes buying underwear thats obviously on the hefty side. Presto Were in an eye-of-the-beholder comedy. Once the two get together there arent many surprises in this agreeably played farce; even the fact that Paltrows father (Joe Vitarelli) turns out to be Blacks boss doesnt raise any eyebrows. Every eye-opener here looms around the outer edges Robbins two scenes; an amazingly dexterous supporting character (Rene Kirby) who was born with spina bifida; and the Farrellys big-hearted inclusion of home movies featuring their entire production crew during Hals closing credits. The two leads work very hard and Paltrows fleshy makeup impresses when in the final scenes were finally allowed to see what she looks like to the rest of the world. But if youve seen the trailer youve largely seen the movie and it could be that the Farrellys may find themselves painted into a corner if crude comedies have gone out of vogue. The only crudeness here is in the uninspired filmmaking and a washed-out look. If this movie were dating it might not get asked out either.

"Shallow Hal | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; shallow-hal ) Shallow Hal (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Since they burst upon the motion picture scene with Dumb and Dumber the Farrelly Brothers Bobby and Peter have been known as the Kings of Vulgar Comedy. So given the Farrellys reputation and a title with the word ""shallow"" in it one might easily expect more of the same from the producing/writing/directing duo. In that respect however Shallow Hal surprises. Neither gross nor obscene nor perverse this motion picture sets out to do something that no other Farrelly Brothers film has yet done tell a story with a moral. Shallow Hal is a sweet somewhat dumb romantic comedy thats almost impossible to actively dislike. Its also tame enough to earn a PG-13 rating from the MPAA (although given the inconsistency of the Ratings Board that doesnt mean much). Hal (Jack Black) is about as shallow as they come. When asked the question of whether he would prefer a woman with only one breast or half a brain his response is ""How big is the breast?"" The shape of a womans figure and the size of her chest are his primary qualifications in choosing a partner. However while that might work for someone with above-average looks Hal could generously be called ""ordinary"". Hence the kind of women hes looking for arent looking for him. Hals best friend Mauricio (Jason Alexander) is in pretty much the same boat so the two of them spend time consoling each other - until fate steps in. One day Hal becomes stuck in an elevator with self-help guru Anthony Robbins. Robbins understanding Hals predicament with women decides to give him a gift - he hypnotizes Hal so when he meets a woman he sees not her physical appearance but her inner beauty. Soon afterwards Hal meets Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow) and is astonished that she is willing to go out with him. However the girl who looks like a stunning willowy blonde to Hal appears to everyone else like a white female version of Professor Sherman Klump. But as Robbins puts it ""The brain sees what the heart want it to feel."" Or something like that... Shallow Hal contains its share of cute scenes and even offers a few surprisingly touching moments (such as the one when Rosemary realizes that Hal is genuinely interested in her not just making fun of her). And as in all romantic comedies of this ilk you have to be willing to greatly suspend disbelief. In for a penny in for a pound. But despite these laudatory qualities theres a flaw to Shallow Hal and its not an insignificant one. The movie is simply and succinctly not especially funny. Oh there are some laughs to be had but most of those punch-lines which concern the differences between how Hal and the world view Rosemary have been given away by the TV commercials and theatrical trailers. Unlike Theres Something About Mary and Me Myself amp; Irene sequences intended to generate laughter are at a premium. In fact there are times when the comedy inasmuch as there is comedy feels forced and contrived - as if the Farrellys realized they are expected to provide raucous humor and grafted some material into the script just to keep their reputation intact. Jack Blacks performance suffers from the same schizoid problem. Black is fine in the low-key scenes but on those occasions when the screenplay demands that he go over-the-top his work seems strained. Its not that he cant play loud rambunctious characters - he did quite well in High Fidelity and Saving Silverman - but it doesnt work here. Meanwhile Gwyneth Paltrow is delightfully sweet as Rosemary the big girl who is discovering the joys of love for the first time (for most of the film Paltrow appears as herself - Rosemary as seen through Hals eyes - but there are occasions when she has to don a huge ""fat suit""). And as the wisecracking ""third wheel"" Jason Alexander provides some acerbic wit. Curiously the message of Shallow Hal is identical to that of Shrek. (Come to think of it there are certain similarities to the plots as well.) Both movies want us to recognize that inner beauty not physical appearance is what counts or to employ the proverb ""Dont judge a book by its cover."" The fact that a Farrelly Brothers comedy has any sort of moral at all comes as something of a shock; nevertheless Shrek offers a more rewarding journey to the same destination. Shallow Hal is light harmless and in need of a dose of the outrageousness that made Theres Something About Mary more enjoyable.
