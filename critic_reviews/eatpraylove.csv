"Eat Pray Love (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Eat Pray Love (PG-13) Based on the mega bestseller by Elizabeth Gilbert the film version is pure wish-fulfillment fantasy. Julia Roberts as ""Elizabeth Gilbert"" and Javier Bardem as ""Felipe"" in Columbia Pictures Eat Pray Love. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald8/11/2010 Editor rating 3 ``I want to go someplace where I can marvel at something the unhappy Liz (Julia Roberts) tells her sympathetic but skeptical best friend (Viola Davis) in Eat Pray Love. Liz a writer based in New York has good reason to shake up her life Shes gone through a painful divorce (is there any other kind?). Her relationship with the rebound guy (James Franco) isnt working out and she feels disconnected from everything. Whats left to do but journey to Italy India and Indonesia in search of herself? Based on the mega bestseller by Elizabeth Gilbert -- who made this same trip albeit with a book contract -- the film version is pure wish-fulfillment fantasy. Who doesnt want to eat her weight in pasta fill the spiritual gaps in her life and then fall madly in love with Spains finest export (Javier Bardem)? Director/screenwriter Ryan Murphy (creator of TVs Glee and Nip/Tuck) really only had to hire a good cinematographer and a solid cast to keep from screwing up things and he manages beautifully. Bali is going to look fabulous pretty much any way you shoot it. And if Eat Pray Love offers little in the way of surprise and a few too many platitudes about ``balance if it lacks the self-deprecating humor and emotional connection of Gilberts book its still an entertaining travelogue that urges you to eat carbs forget dieting and just go up a jeans size because men will want you anyway. Fantasy yes. Male cynics will sneer but any woman who ever turned down a gooey slice of pizza will know what Im talking about. Roberts of course makes the movie. If you have ever doubted that shes a star note the scene in which Liz sitting outdoors at a little Roman cafe watches a couple kissing and then glances down at her gorgeous plate of pasta. The lascivious grin she gives her spaghetti packs enough voltage to light up the theater. Also excellent is Richard Jenkins as a straight-talking Texan whom Liz meets at the ashram and who guides her matter-of-factly on her spiritual journey and Bardem as her eventual love interest who actually weeps at one point. You think women liked him before? Wait until they see him sniffling over saying goodbye to his vacationing son. Billy Crudup fares less well as Lizs husband possibly because the script has turned him into something of a buffoon instead of just a guy from whom his wife has grown apart. The adult promotional tie-ins for Eat Pray Love -- Lonely Planet and STA Travel are the ``official travel partners of the movie just for starters -- are off-putting but understandable. The film is far from perfect but its likely to inspire more than few quests for balance -- or at least a fabulous bowl of linguine. Cast Julia Roberts Javier Bardem Richard Jenkins James Franco Viola Davis Billy Crudup. Director Ryan Murphy. Screenwriters Ryan Murphy Jennifer Salt. Based on the book by Elizabeth Gilbert.

By David Denby Julia Roberts looks for her inner self in Italy India and Bali.   Credit Illustration by Robert Risko ""Eat Pray Love"" in which Julia Roberts plays the writer Elizabeth Gilbert--a divorcee looking for truth in highly photogenic locales--dribbles on for an eternity sometimes intelligently and companionably sometimes vacuously. But then late in the film Javier Bardem unshaven heavy-lidded and friendly arrives in a Jeep and runs the bicycling Roberts off the road near her Bali retreat. Toro ex machina. The movie suddenly stops dithering. Bardem apologizes and pursues Roberts with that mixture of warmth and humor which makes him something of an irresistible force. ""Eat Pray Love"" a quest for selfhood ends as a conventional romantic story. After so many questions so much travel is that enough for us? Gilberts 2006 autobiographical narrative (which has commas between the words) has become a kind of bible for the dissatisfied educated woman; its a much loved book but virtually impossible to adapt faithfully--its appeal lies in Gilberts nattering voice. A New York-based writer of both fiction and nonfiction (""The Last American Man"") Gilbert takes us through her life at thirty-two. She undergoes a tough divorce begins and ends a rebound affair and escapes a bad case of the blues by sampling the gustatory and spiritual gifts of Italy India and Bali. She looks for her inner self by moving around and reaching out. She wants God whom she talks to now and then; she wants fried zucchini blossoms; and after some hesitation she wants sex. She wants everything and we may get the impression that the world in its glory exists principally to satisfy her complicated needs. As she leaves New York Gilbert becomes the latest (and gabbiest) version of Henry Jamess heiress of all the ages the young American abroad ready for whatever life brings. At the same time Gilbert the writer is attentive to such things as flesh weather architecture temperament; shes genuinely curious about how things work in foreign cultures. And shes funny about herself ripely amused by her own greedy yet guilty temperament which spins through endless cycles of desire anticipation and regret. Humor is almost nonexistent in spiritual seekers; the easy presence of it in Gilberts book makes us pull for her through all her many flukes and funks. The book is irrepressible the exuberant spill of a born scribbler. Apart from occasional bits of narration however the movie--directed by a TV fellow Ryan Murphy (""Glee"") and written by Murphy and Jennifer Salt (the former actress)--dispenses with Gilberts ruminations. It moves outside her holding to the structure of her narrative without settling on a dramatic equivalent for her voice. Im disappointed but Im not sure the filmmakers had any other choice. As a literary character Gilbert repeatedly trips over her own self-consciousness and watching someone exactly like her for more than two hours might have been trying. By contrast Julia Roberts a decade older than the heroine of the book has her own stature and charm--her specific gravity. She also has her career crisis. What do you play when you pass forty and no longer fit into Hollywoods narrow market-based notions of glamour? If youre Barbara Stanwyck Joan Crawford Katharine Hepburn or Meryl Streep you play serious roles. But Hollywood obsessed with gratifying a young audience no longer has much use for drama--at least not in big-budget movies. Until the end ""Eat Pray Love"" itself has little dramatic life. Yet Elizabeth Gilbert is still a good moment--perhaps a transitional moment--for Roberts. Gilbert (or Liz as everyone calls her) is a woman looking for something but not quite sure what it is and as an actress Roberts also appears to be searching. Shes often quiet attentive observant; she doesnt need to dominate every scene as she did in last years ""Duplicity."" Her Liz asks humbly for advice from a toothless guru in Bali and in an ashram in India struggles comically to tame her buzzing mind and settle into meditation. Roberts is willing to appear lost at odds with herself. Yet she doesnt remain that way forever; eventually the familiar horse laugh--the pleasure in life that drew audiences to her in the first place--bursts out of her. She has what we want from a movie character trying to find herself--not only a new happy openness to experience but pride as well. In the early chatty New York sections of the film Roberts overmatches the male actors even as shes trying to hold herself in. Billy Crudup has been cast as her husband Stephen and its hard to say what Crudup and Murphy thought they were doing with the character. Stephen is hollow and indecisive an intelligent man without a profession and Crudup with nothing to play turns himself into a clown grimacing exploding with antic jokes. We get the idea that Stephen is desperately trying to appeal to Liz by performing for her but Crudups own performance is a jumble of fits and starts and Roberts looks at him with no more than fond exasperation. Liz moves on to a good-looking young actor played by James Franco and were baffled yet again. Gilbert describes the affair as ""passionate"" but theres nothing resembling passion onscreen. Franco is cuddly sleepy-eyed and distant with a dopey grin and a bodiless voice. Hes vague to the point of inanity. When Liz walks out on him she becomes depressed and guilty but we cant imagine what she has lost by leaving either of these two men. The movie passes to its travelogue section which is initially a relief--the grappling intertwined statues of the Roman fountains are far more active than anything in the New York scenes. Italy provides Liz with a sensual education a return to the life of the body (though not yet to romance). The cinematographer Robert Richardson floods the screen with light and Ryan Murphy moves rapidly around the city. Murphy turns out to be a very square tour guide however with a taste for the obvious. The heroine learns Italian wanders the narrow streets and makes many friends all of them charming who talk with her eat with her and make no demands whatsoever. Liz learns how to order a meal in a restaurant which is presented as a triumph and Murphy gives us a montage of succulent dishes a shower of grated cheese. All of this is pleasant enough in a stupefyingly innocuous way. Were not so much involved in the movie as idly registering it--eavesdropping almost on a conversation at an adjoining table. Liz moves to the ashram and pleasure gives way to the next phase in her globe-trotting renewal devotion. Will some urgency come into the picture? Our hopes are quickly dashed. Explaining how the ashram works Murphy is respectful--too respectful. The scenes of religious life are muted placid a little dim. When Liz struggles with meditation the filmmakers give the scene a minute or two and then back away. They may be telling themselves that the essence of meditation is internal ineffable difficult to dramatize but it would have been nice if theyd tried. ""Eat Pray Love"" might have died in the ashram if it werent for the wonderful actor Richard Jenkins who turns up as a fellow-seeker a character everyone calls Richard from Texas. Jenkins who often plays quiet and repressed men does the most aggressive and heart-rending acting of his life. Richard from Texas is filled with guilt and anger. In a rasping voice he takes out his rage on Liz bullying her trying to turn her upside down. No one in movies has spoken this brusquely to Julia Roberts in years and at first she looks startled but she comes back at him without resentment. Their scenes together resonate for anyone who has watched Robertss career she has to stand up to a force greater than her own and she passes the test. Great dramatic roles may lie in her future if anyone has the courage to finance them. Seeking ""balance"" Liz travels to Bali at which point Javier Bardems Felipe--a Brazilian import-export guy with fine brown eyes and a beautiful house--moves into her life and lays siege. The romantic scenes are a treat but feminist objections momentarily arise. If the yearlong quest were undertaken by a man would love and (very likely) marriage be considered an adequate goal for him? Would a man not reach for some higher destiny? Only a few years ago after all Sean Penns ""Into the Wild"" celebrated the isolation and death in Alaska of the very young Chris McCandless--a solitary seeker for spiritual truth. But the objections quickly die in retrospect McCandlesss implacable revolt against a bourgeois order he was too young to understand seems creepy and perhaps just ignorant. A more experienced man Walter Hustons wanderer in William Wylers ""Dodsworth"" (1936) finds happiness in the cultivated arms of Mary Astor. And Elizabeth Gilbert certainly is not cut out for anything like martyrdom. Javier Bardem easily the most appealing ""foreign"" lover seen in American movies since Charles Boyers heyday seventy years ago is about as good an argument for the conventional satisfactions of life as there is. When Roberts hesitates and asks her guru in Bali if she wont lose her precious balance by giving in to love half the women in the audience will probably say ""Girl are you crazy?""

There weve saved you twelve bucks. _ By David Edelstein Published Aug 16 2010 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Francois Duhamel/Columbia Pictures) In the golden turd that is Eat Pray Love everyone helps Julia Roberts find herself so she can then experience true love. For most of her life she tells us in narration cut-and-pasted from Elizabeth Gilberts fulsome memoir she would lose herself in men. Now the hunt is on for that missing self. Wherever she goesRome India Balishe forms fast friendships with people who instantly unburden themselves. They give to her and she gives to them. But she gets the close-ups. And the backlighting which kisses the wisps of her hair and gives her an aureole a magical aura. In movies even star vehicles when a character embarks on a journey of self-discovery you need to feel at some point as if he or she is truly alone in an alien environment with none of the normal support systems. But in Eat Pray Love all the exotic places are sculpted to set off their illustrious visitor. The world meets her more than halfwayprobably 98 percent. Gilberts bookwith its drama-queen contortions in which small moments of panic take on cosmic dimensionsisnt a natural for movies but its not junk uplift. In her wonderful nonfiction book The Last American Man Gilbert indulged both her male-hero-worshipping bent and her envy of a man who could forgo all dependencies and be fully autonomous. In Eat Pray Love after fleeing her marriage and falling for a handsome actor who found her a tad clingy Gilbert stumbled into a scenario that resonated with women in search of their own autonomyespecially white women with a bit of money. She traveled to Italy where she stopped feeling guilty about stuffing herself with pasta and ice cream. Then she traveled to an ashram in India where she purged all those toxins and cleared her cluttered mind by learning to forgive herself. Then she ended up in Bali with a toothless medicine man where she spent part of each day meditating and part in search of real pleasure. When Signor Right (from Brazil) shows up she finally loves herself enough to be able to love him back. Ryan Murphy the creator of Glee and Nip/Tuck has an agreeable camp sensibility but when he sets out to direct a womans picture and play it straight the results are stupefying. He has no clue how to shoot the scenes between his heroine Elizabeth Gilbert and the Adonis played by James Franco who has never shown so little of his puckish intelligence. The Italian abbondanza eating scenes are edited like Riunite commercials the food so obviously styled that it kills the piggy fun. Try not to hoot when the gaunt Roberts makes a bring-on-the-flab speech to persuade the equally slender Tuva Novotny to eat pizza even if they get muffin tops. Murphy opens the India sequence with a Julia-amid-the-beggars music video (the song is M.I.A.s Boyz) that dwarfs even the pizza scene for gross insensitivity. Richard Jenkins and Javier Bardem (Joo are afraid to love again) are artful enough to muffle all the clunks but the only time I smiled was when Michael Cumpsty as a swami showed offfor a secondhis crack British timing. In the most convincing moment in Eat Pray Love Robertss Gilbert finds herself too distracted to meditate; in the least convincing she sits in the lotus position wearing a beatific smile. No wonder we can never relax and see the world through her eyes. Theyve cast the only woman on Earth who can make Elizabeth Gilbert seem easy. There is too much hell in Yael Hersonskis documentary A Film Unfinished to begin to evoke it adequately. Its assembled around reels discovered in a German vault Nazi footage of life inside the Warsaw Ghettohalf a million starving Jews squeezed into three square milescirca 1942 before most of the population was shipped to Treblinka and the remainder lost their lives fighting back. But the footage was not meant to be the basis of a fly-on-the-wall portrait. Many of the scenes were stagedby directors in uniforms with gunsto create a work of propaganda. No one knows what its scenario would have been but the best guess is the Nazis meant to show well-off Jews eating and performing their weird Jew rituals and going about their Jew lives while poor Jews starved to death under their feet. And no one knows why the film remained unfinished. I would like to think that the footage was too terrible for even the Nazi propagandists to bearthat the hard stares of passersby into the camera chilled them as much as it does us 68 years later. Vain hope. The horror of A Film Unfinished transcends even its images of suffering and death among the most obscene ever captured. It becomes a meditation on the dual nature of film on a reality at once true and false essential and tainted. Eat Pray Love Columbia Pictures. PG-13. A Film Unfinished Oscilloscope Laboratories. R.

Jennie Punter The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 13 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Eat Pray Love Directed by Ryan Murphy Screenplay by Ryan Murphy and Jennifer Salt Starring Julia Roberts James Franco Richard Jenkins Viola Davis Billy Crudup and Javier Bardem Eat Pray Love is a sumptuous new travel food and self-help show hosted by the always likable Julia Roberts. Well what did you think a Hollywood-made adaptation of Elizabeth Gilberts best-selling memoir would look like? Director Ryan Murphy - whose previous feature was his adaptation of Augusten Burroughss memoir Running with Scissors - and co-screenwriter Jennifer Salt strive to capture the tone of Gilberts chatty-girlfriend literary style but fall back too often on voice-over narration provided by Roberts as the globe-trotting Liz. They also try to visualize some of the savoury private moments and revelations during the authors inner journey of soul healing. But its a near-impossible task in a film that must by its very nature show us an exterior world and thus hit all the stops - Italy India Bali - on Gilberts adventure and visit most of the people she met. Running more than two hours - a very long time for an adaptation of a book without a plot - Eat Pray Love is like an overstuffed lightweight suitcase with little room for us to feel the emotional connections Liz makes with new friends along the way. Although there are a lot of hugs. Of course with Julia Roberts as our constant onscreen companion the trip has its pleasures. She does some lovely work here particularly in a few one-on-one scenes with well-cast supporting players who slow down the pace. And she revels in her postcard moments like eating a tasty breakfast on the floor of a ramshackle Rome apartment or cycling down a country road in Bali. The film opens with a too-long prologue in which Lizs marriage (Billy Crudup as the restless husband) unravels followed by a rebound romance with a young actor (James Franco) destined for the same fate. Her publisher pal (Viola Davis) isnt convinced Lizs plan to leave New York for a year - dividing her time equally between the cafes of Rome an ashram in India and the village of a Balinese medicine man - will solve her problems. We glean that Lizs main issues are that shes a serial monogamist who loses herself in relationships and feels empty inside. At Lizs final port of call she literally crashes into Felipe (she on a bike him in a jeep). Javier Bardem fits the bill as the sexy still-smarting divorced father of two grown-up kids and generates some genuine warmth with Roberts although by the time we get to Bali were starting to get anxious about getting our exit visa. Robertss best moments are her scenes with Richard Jenkins (HBOs Six Feet Under) who plays a cantankerous Texan who christens her ""Groceries"" (she eats a lot) and despite her initial protests takes her under his wing at the ashram. He has Lizs number barking out Dr. Phil-esque life slogans at every turn but Jenkins lets us know there is real pain just under the surface. When he finally sits down and spills out his story the movie for the first and only time stands still. Its a riveting scene yet its emotional impact is nearly spoiled by a bit of whimsy the filmmakers follow it up with showing Liz letting go of her pain. In the end Eat Pray Love has to inform us via Lizs narration that the lessons of friendship can be just as transformative as meditation and the words of gurus because all weve just seen is a whole lot of faces and places.

Starring Julia Roberts as Liz it follows the author from the wreckage of her personal life in New York City to a year divvied up among Italy India and Indonesia. And it may come as a bit of a shock to some that the most interesting turns in the woman-on-a-quest sojourn dont belong to Roberts luminous though she is. Those are owned by a number of misty-eyed if masculine menfolk. There is Italian tutor Giovanni (Luca Argentero) who exudes a sweet-yet-confident guy allure especially in a brief but winning scene about gratitude. There is Richard a guy from Texas (Richard Jenkins) chanting penance in India. And finally there is the divorced Felipe (Javier Bardem) from Brazil living in Bali the end point of Lizs year-long journey of self-recovery and discovery. Perhaps the films guy sensitivities shouldnt surprise moviegoers. Gilbert penned 2002s insightful biography ""The Last American Man"" about Eustace Conway who left the world of modern comforts at 17 to set up a frontier-style existence in North Carolinas Turtle Island Preserve. In Gilberts memoir of striking out on her own her deft and open-hearted recounting of her nascent relationship to God often put the ""I"" in the endeavor. So much so that ""Eat Pray Love"" has elicited a loopy contempt from some readers (and nonreaders) who bristle at her seeming me-me- me-isms. (Then theres Andrew Gottliebs cleverly titled nonetheless parasitic book ""Drink Play Fk."") Roberts does a nice job squelching the uncharitable resentment. Liz still lives large as she wrestles demons of need. But likability is among the still- coltish Roberts great gifts. ""Eat Pray Love"" is directed by ""Glee"" co-creator Ryan Murphy who co-wrote the adaptation with Jennifer Salt (a collaborator on ""Nip/Tuck""). While Murphy brought a few incandescent moments to the recent adaptation of the memoir ""Running With Scissors"" he doesnt bring the right sensibility to ""Eat Pray Love."" As pretty as it is its basically a beautiful travelogue a gussied-up romantic drama. Think ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" with a lot more frequent-flier miles. Gilberts central theme of spiritual hankering and her existential ache for deep connection were never going to be an easy leap from page to screen. As profound a human gesture as it is seeking can be sort of goofy or sanctimonious or amazingly both at once. For all the scenes of Liz meditating the movie doesnt feel like it gets it whatever that ineffable ""it"" is. Lizs forward motion is punctuated by (or at two-plus hours impeded by) the occasional flashback. A glimpse of her soon-to-be ex-husband Stephen (Billy Crudup) caught in a moment of grief brought on by his battle to thwart an inevitable divorce is more than a bit heart-pinching. Viola Davis portrays Delia Lizs sounding board publisher and best friend. Shes got a baby and a husband the two things our hero learns she doesnt want. (At least not until Gilberts follow-up memoir ""Committed A Skeptic Makes Peace With Marriage"" published in January.) Instead she opts for Italian classes in Rome an ashram in India and a nice room with quite the view in Bali. When in Rome Liz eats like Italians with relish. A scene over pizza in Naples is a lecture on pleasure. In last summers womens picture the half-perfect ""Julie amp; Julia"" Julia Child was an unapologetic giant of appetite no preaching required. But for those women obsessed with fitting into their skinny jeans Lizs advice to Sofi (Tuva Novotny in a nice turn) might help them enjoy a slice of living. Liz travels to India to meditate with a guru introduced to her by soon-to-be ex-boyfriend David (James Franco). At the retreat she meets ""Richard From Texas."" As the fellow American searcher the increasingly incomparable Richard Jenkins (""The Visitor"") stills the soul of the film for a spell. In Bali she tracks down an awesomely toothless healer (Hadi Subiyanto) who once read the story of her life etched in her palm. She seeks him out and also finds Felipe (Bardem). Throughout director Murphy relies on Dario Marianellis too-swelling score to do the heavy lifting. Instead of underscoring the ""pray"" of the title (that strange honorable effort of asking and listening) the film goes for heightened romance over nuance and quiet. Shot by ace cinematographer Robert Richardson ""Eat Pray Love"" can be enchanting or pungent or book-me-a- ticket beautiful. (See Sundays Denver Post Travel for evidence of the books power to sway travelers.) And the beckoning travel-mag aesthetics make for an intriguing conundrum.

(AP Photo/Sony Francois Duhamel FILE) NO SALES The essence of any place any person any thing can be summed up in a single word Elizabeth Gilberts Italian friends tell her in the ""Eat"" portion of ""Eat Pray Love"" based on Gilberts best-selling 2006 memoir. In that case the word that sums up the essence of this movie is ""frustrating.""If you are not one of the millions who have read ""Eat Pray Love"" (the book title had commas; the movie title does not) heres an outlineSelf-absorbed New Yorker Liz bolts from her marriage then leaves a passionate rebound romance with a younger man to find herself. The search takes her to Italy where she eats; to India where she prays; and finally to Bali where she loves. Readers identified with Lizs desire to find balance in her life with her restless need to make connections with her willingness to reach out for spiritual help from any source. At least many readers did. Others including this one wished that someone somewhere would grab Liz by the shoulders shake her and tell her to get over herself.As embodied by movie darling Julia Roberts though no shaking is required. This Liz Gilbert is immensely likable and entirely sympathetic even if we raise a skeptical eyebrow at the idea of her quest and wonder how she paid for it on the heels of a financially disastrous divorce. (Her book deal disclosed in the memoir isnt mentioned here.)No contemporary actress crumples in sorrow more sympathetically than Roberts and none glows more joyously. The movies scenes in Rome and Naples are a delight incorporating the cleverest lines from the book while celebrating the glories of Italian food. One lovely interlude features nothing but Roberts polishing off a bowl of spaghetti to the soundtrack of Italian opera.Sadly Italy is left behind as Liz heads off to a spiritual center in India to meet the guru of her ex-boyfriend -- but never mind. As the book did the movie then slows to a numbingly meditative pace and we have time to pray at length for a return to Italy. (That pizza) Eventually Liz moves on to her third stop in beautiful Bali where an ancient medicine man helps with her spiritual journey. So it turns out does a Brazilian expatriate who vows to be champion. (Dont expect the rollicking sex scenes from the book though. They take place almost entirely behind a tastefully closed bamboo door.) Director Ryan Murphy (""Nip/Tuck"" ""Glee"") has brought ""Eat Pray Love"" to glorious life scenically. The movie is above all a lovely travelogue plunging us viscerally into the middle of every country.Whats the problem then? Well ""Eat Pray Love"" is too long by at least half an hour and Murphy who wrote the screenplay with Jennifer Salt chose not to excise some parts of the book that clearly couldnt be dramatized well.But thats merely what makes the movie draggy. What makes it frustrating is Roberts complete lack of chemistry with any of the men who play her lovers Billy Crudup as her husband James Franco as her young boyfriend and most crucially Javier Bardem as Brazilian Felipe.Blame miscasting because its difficult to blame Roberts for anything. Like her medicine man moviegoers just want to see her smile -- with her face with her mind and even with her liver. Eat Pray Love Aug 10 2010 (...)

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 12 2010 1041 PM Eat Pray Watch Julia Roberts on a year-long journey of self-discovery. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Eat Pray Love check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunesor directly with our RSS feed. Julia Roberts as Elizabeth Gilbert in Eat Pray Love ""Tell the truth tell the truth tell the truth"" chants the epigraph to Elizabeth Gilberts monster best-seller Eat Pray Love. In the memoir that follows Gilbert does tell the factual truth--the story of how after a painful divorce and a period of deep depression she spent a year traveling alone to Italy India and Indonesia on a book-contract-fueled voyage of self-discovery. But theres something about that chatty rambling maddeningly readable book that remains irreducibly phony. Gilbert is a skilled deployer of her own considerable charm; she knows just when to make herself vulnerable by revealing a personal failing when to crack an earthy joke when to flash the literary equivalent of a flirtatious smile. But that very skill can make Gilberts prose feel calculated and synthetic. In short Elizabeth Gilbert is the Julia Roberts of writers which means that the film adaptation by Ryan Murphy (the creator of Nip/Tuck and Glee) got at least one thing right. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Few actresses can telegraph pleasure as well as Roberts which is why the ""eat"" portion of the film in which her character packs away so much Roman pasta that her jean size soars from 0 to 1 is the most enjoyable of the three. But for those who havent read the book it wont be easy to grasp how and why Liz gets to Rome in the first place. A rushed and cursory setup has her breaking up with her husband (Billy Crudup) and embarking on a doomed affair with a young actor (James Franco) with little apparent motivation; both men and in fact every male character in the movie seem handsome charming and besotted with her. We know Liz has hit rock bottom because she tells her publisher Delia (Viola Davis) ""Ive hit rock bottom"" not because weve accompanied her on the way down. Advertisement Prozac would be considerably less overprescribed if more writers had publishers like Delia who lets herself be convinced that a book advance large enough to finance a year of world travel will be just the thing for what ails Liz. (Its a flaw of both the book and the film that the negotiation of this contract is glossed over so hastily. Theres no shame in having landed a sweet book deal and having the financial underpinnings of Gilberts trip made plain would help to mitigate the audiences resentment at her barely acknowledged privilege.) Once in Italy Liz takes language classes wanders around in cute outfits gandering at fountains and orders marvelous meals with an assortment of international friends while Martha Stewarts food stylist hovers just off-screen with a spray bottle of liquid glycerin. This part of the movie is my favorite because its an unabashed glossy travelogue; as viewers were not asked to do anything more than acknowledge the irrefutable fact that il dolce far niente looks like a lot of fun. The ""pray"" section in which Liz seeks spiritual solace in an Indian ashram is a tougher sell. Watching a person meditate makes for less than dynamic cinema and the ooglety-booglety inner journeys that Gilbert describes in the book are hard to bring to life on the page let alone on-screen. The dramatic interest of the India chapter comes from Richard (Richard Jenkins) a fellow spiritual seeker and recovering alcoholic from Texas who befriends Liz with mystifying alacrity--minutes into their first conversation hes already bestowed on her an affectionate nickname. Jenkins a fine character actor invests Richard with an easygoing gravitas but I never got around the essential phoniness of the Liz/Richard relationship. His character seems to exist for the sole purpose of dispensing folksy epigrams about acceptance and faith. The one scene in which Richard does get a chance to tell his own story is a nakedly manipulative play on the viewers emotions. This scene is meant to show that Liz and Richard have reached a new level of trust with one another but it marked the moment when I stopped trusting the movie. Once Liz has checked spiritual seeking off her travel to-do list she heads to Bali where an old medicine man (Hadi Subiyanto) takes her on as a student and amanuensis. Amid the islands lush jungles and libidinous expat parties she meets a crinkly-eyed Brazilian businessman Felipe (Javier Bardem) whose bossa-nova mix tapes might as well be titled ""Have Sex With Me Right Now."" But Liz still damaged by the wreckage of her past two relationships takes a while to respond to Felipes advances. When she does this bland cautious film ventures for a moment into uncharacteristically daring territory. Theres a suggestion that as tempting as Felipe may be Liz might be better served by opting out of yet another all-consuming love affair. Shes afraid of losing her hard-won sense of balance she tells her new suitor and the panic in her eyes as she resists his somewhat smothering advances felt to me like the movies lone moment of emotional truth. But like the rest of the revelations in Eat Pray Love(Columbia) this one comes at almost no cost. In Gilbert-land its possible to have your prayer and eat it too.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Elizabeth Gilberts mega-bestseller Eat Pray Love is a memoir but its also as much a wish-fulfillment fantasy as any smutty romance novel the story of a woman who ditched an unfulfilling marriage in favor of world travel a joyous food binge a spiritual enlightenment that brought out her inner self-validating cheerleader and a sweaty love affair with an ardently devoted older man. Trouble is most of the major changes took place inside her head and heart which makes her story a natural fit for a book but an awkward one for a film. Director Ryan Murphy (creator of Glee and Nip/Tuck; his only previous big-screen effort was 2006s Running With Scissors another adaptation of a hugely popular memoir) tries to communicate Gilberts pre-journey angst through darkly lit rooms rainstorms and aggrieved narration repurposed from the book; once she hits Italy sunlight beams down transcendently and every shot is calculated for beauty. But its all external trappings trying to express internal developments and the movies hand-holding stridency just emphasizes the artificiality of its fantasy. Julia Roberts emphatic performance as Gilbert is just one more element that feels overplayed. Like any superstar Roberts has her familiar shticks and she runs through them as if working from a list--the wide-eyed weepy looks as she navigates a divorce (from Billy Crudup) and an affair (with James Franco) the sunny smiles as she discovers the joys of guiltlessly focusing on her own pleasure. But the externalizing of what the book treated as an inner journey means that Murphy and co-writer Jennifer Salt (a frequent Nip/Tuck collaborator) have to portray these relationships in detail. And by showing Gilberts partners as real confused wounded people instead of abstract obstacles he makes her look selfish and shallow without ever coming closer to expressing the reasoning behind her choices. And here what she chooses looks awfully like a standard rom-com with exotic trappings. Some silly invented episodes involving an escaped elephant and a trumped-up final-act disagreement with idealized lover Javier Bardem force the story onto overly familiar ground. For someone supposedly focused on inner balance and self-determination the film version of Gilbert spends an awful lot of time moping dramatically over her celibacy (to painfully obvious musical cues like Neil Youngs ""Heart Of Gold"") or getting affirmation from sexy guys and wise gurus including Richard Jenkins in a painfully scripted but well-acted role. Its understandable All these exposition-and-wisdom-spouting people help bring the action out of Gilberts head and into the world. But they also help transform it into a world not just of positive messages but of silly cliches. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Scott Pilgrim Vs.

"Eat Pray Love review Julia Roberts in a sexy romance |       NJ.com comments Eat Pray Love review Julia Roberts in a sexy romance Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 13 2010 at 823 AM updated August 13 2010 at 904 AM View/Post Comments Francois DuhamelJulia Roberts as Liz Gilbert in Italy in ""Eat Pray Love"" the movie based on the real-life adventures of Gilbert. EAT PRAY LOVE movie review Eat Pray Love"" is the unconventional story of one womans search for meaning. What works best in it however is the conventional story of her search for love. Based on Elizabeth Gilberts best-selling memoir it details how the author -- reeling from the one-two punch of a bad divorce and an unhappy affair -- took a year off to find herself. She looked in the fattening pleasures of Italy. She looked in the meditations of an Indian ashram And found her true self at last in Bali -- reflected in the eyes of a new and attentive man. The books devoted fans will see this as an oversimplification. Still it underlines what plays well in this movie (a sunnily blond Julia Roberts the casual carnality of Javier Bardem) and what does not (a Balinese seer who seems one step up from Madame Marie solipsistic ""breakthroughs"" like ""The god within me is me""). Movie Review Eat Pray Love (PG-13) Columbia (133 min.) Directed by Ryan Murphy. With Julia Roberts Javier Bardem. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Stephen Whittys review TWO AND A HALF STARS Its a thin line between ""self-aware"" and ""self-involved"" and its one the movie treads uncertainly. The sometimes vague adaptation may leave casual viewers wondering just what was so terrible about Roberts marriage to dilettantish (but devoted) Billy Crudup. Or how anyone can afford to take off an entire year and simply travel the world. For a spiritual story there seems to be an awful lot of self-indulgence and privilege. Is it ""Eat Pray Spend""? Maybe just a bit but at least the pensione Roberts stays in is run-down and while she seems to have fit a lot of clothes into her limited luggage theres no obvious fashion porn. This spiritual quest isnt ""The Razors Edge"" sadly but neither is it ""Sex and the City 3."" (Roberts flat worn sandals almost function as a silent rebuke to Sarah Jessica Parkers Manolos.) The best parts of the film though are clearly the ""Eat"" and the ""Love."" The first third is a virtual advertisement for Rome and its food full of gorgeous cinematography by Robert Richardson (a regular recent collaborator with Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino). The ancient ruins never looked more alive the lifestyle never more irresistible. And in the third and final section at last the movie moves into the romantic genre it has been avoiding (and its audience has been wishing for) all along. Bardem shows up as an ex-pat Brazilian sambas start on the soundtrack and finally he takes Roberts hand and murmurs ""Its time."" And throughout the theater women murmur ""It sure is."" Bardem is effortlessly charming and nicely commanding (in what in romantic dramas is typically a thankless objectified role). In fact all the male performers are very good. (Richard Jenkins has a standout scene as a fellow seeker in India.) Even Roberts who so often projects mere impatient superiority rediscovers an on-screen vulnerability. Of course some on-screen selflessness would have helped here too -- finding meaning by working in some homegrown charity perhaps instead of working on her own bliss in some far-flung country. But then this film is Gilberts book and Gilberts book is her life. Or perhaps the other way around Shes already got another volume ""Committed"" out of her hunky Brazilian.

Starring Julia Roberts James Franco Richard Jenkins Viola Davis Billy Crudup Javier Bardem Tuva Novotny Ali Khan Lidia Biondi Arlene Tur Director Ryan Murphy Release Opened Aug 13 2010  Editorial Review For Julia a New Age journeyBy Ann HornadayFriday August 13 2010Anyone bringing Elizabeth Gilberts blockbuster memoir of self-discovery ""Eat Pray Love"" to the screen has a huge challenge before him How to overcome the books episodic anecdotal structure and penchant for aphorism to create a dynamic narrative? Even more daunting how does one dramatize what is essentially an interior journey? The answer at least according to director Ryan Murphy (""Glee"") is to photograph Julia Roberts looking by turns beatific pained and just slightly self-pitying against as many fabulous backdrops as possible. That strategy pays off with uneven success in ""Eat Pray Love"" in which Roberts portrays the author as she recovers from a disastrous divorce painful rebound relationship and general spiritual ennui on a year-long trip through Italy India and Bali. The films most crucial constituency -- the books rabid fans -- are likely to feel well served by Murphys adaptation which hews pretty faithfully to Gilberts story. (He veers off the path most wildly in India where he was stuck filming Roberts meditating or trying to meditate for hours on end full stop.) And even newcomers men included can enjoy being swept up in the films lavish third chapter where Gilbert meets a seductive Brazilian named Felipe (Javier Bardem) and embarks on a luscious love affair amid the verdant terraces and soft beaches of Bali. All that eye candy aside though ""Eat Pray Love"" cant be described as a home run. At least during the movies first third Murphy doesnt stop moving his camera compulsively swooping it around and perching it above the action as if it were a neurotic bird of prey. The perspective is at its most jangled in Italy where Gilbert is supposed to discover the joys of Italys language food and ""joy in doing nothing."" But Murphy American that he is doesnt slow down long enough to convey the countrys sensuous pleasures or to flesh out the personalities of the friends Gilbert meets while pursuing them. Her supporting characters get a little more time in India where Gilbert meets the expansive ""Richard from Texas"" played here by Richard Jenkins in a scene-stealing turn as a broken man healing his scars through bravado and spiritual seeking. Its in India too that ""Eat Pray Loves"" most affecting sequence transpires as Gilbert makes peace with her ex-husband played by Billy Crudup in a thankless but accomplished performance. (For the record James Franco plays the post-divorce boyfriend bringing every ounce of irresistible boyish charisma to the task.) Roberts who cannily chose to produce ""Eat Pray Love"" as the perfect vehicle for her alternately dazzling and relatable talents manages to tamp down the books most grating self-congratulatory tone. But in the movie as in the book all talk of God the universe and love and light aside theres no doubt who the real star is. As a middle-aged Dorothy at large in a New Age Oz her Liz Gilbert mostly wanders around smiling sometimes crying but always somehow looking like a goddess herself recently arrived to show others the way -- whether shes urging a Swedish student in Rome to eat more pizza or telling a teenage Indian girl reluctantly succumbing to an arranged marriage that shes visualizing a happy life for her. (Uhm thanks?) By the time Gilbert arrives in Bali the extravagant beauty of that island -- made all the more eye-popping by the presence of Bardem -- is likely to inspire filmgoers simply to sigh sit back and enjoy the view. What exactly does Gilbert learn at the feet of the jolly elderly medicine man she feels destined to befriend -- aside from how to smile with her liver? Its never clear and it doesnt much matter. ""Eat Pray Love"" finally settles into its own cinematic destiny as an attractive escapist love story in which the romance is more with the I than with the guy.Contains brief strong profanity some sexual references and male rear nudity.

Photo (c)Columbia Pictures/courtesy Ever ((c)Columbia Pictures/courtesy Ever) A year-long around-the-world quest for self-fulfillment that basically goes nowhere ""Eat Pray Love"" is a very shallow very glossy 21/2-hour travelogue starring a miscast Julia Roberts as a spoiled self-centered divorcee who decides to get away from it all. Though its based on a hugely popular Oprah-endorsed memoir by Elizabeth Gilbert theres little in the script or in Roberts wrongheaded Big Movie Star Performance to explain why in the space of six months Elizabeth dumps both her husband of a decade (Billy Crudup) and a younger actor/yogi (James Franco) both of whom adore her. Most likely shes bored a sentiment that will likely be felt most acutely by guys dragged to see this overproduced self-congratulatory collage of New Age-y cliches. PHOTOS JULIA ROBERTS LEADING MEN ""You know what I feel when I get up in the morning?"" whines Elizabeth. ""Nothing."" Thats pretty much how I felt about this movie except for the first section which takes our heroine to Italy where she learns ""You Americans dont know how to enjoy yourselves"" from the natives and eats up a storm. The food is enticingly photographed and it made me hungry -- but I was hungrier still for a story that involved any crisis larger than Elizabeth (who still looks near anorexic) struggling to get into a pair of jeans after a pasta-and-pizza binge. This near-total lack of dramatic conflict continues when Elizabeth arrives at an ashram in a very well-scrubbed India no doubt with Pratesi sheets in her backpack. Between meditations Elizabeth endures some very mild needling from a fellow American spiritualist (Richard Jenkins) a recovering alcoholic who dispenses a long string of aphorisms or as she calls them ""bumper stickers."" ""I think you have the capacity some day to love the whole world"" he tells her with a perfectly straight face. Theres lots more of these -- like ""God dwells within you as you"" which hopefully sounded less silly on the printed page than as a line of dialogue. As the title indicates the last trip of Elizabeths journey -- financed by a hefty book advance that goes unmentioned in the movie -- involves romance. By this point shes in Bali where she rents what looks like a 5000-a-night beachfront cottage. ""Since the bombing business has been way down so I can give you this place at a very good price"" says a real estate agent -- the only line in this humorless movie that made me laugh however unintentionally. Love comes in the form of a sexy Brazilian (Javier Bardem) getting over his own divorce who literally runs into Elizabeth with a Jeep. Like all of the other characters in this movie -- including Viola Davis criminally wasted as Elizabeths stereotypical straight-talking African-American best friend and several condescendingly played natives -- this guy exists primarily as a concept. So she can tell him ""I do not need to love you to love myself."" Though I tend to doubt it its possible that ""Eat Pray Love"" could have worked with a different star or a less deferential director. Im a big fan of Roberts -- I gave ""Duplicity"" four stars -- but portraying this type of inner conflict is not in her skill set. Its something Gwyneth Paltrow not one of my favorites did effortlessly in Murphys previous feature ""Running With Scissors"" which may have been problematic but at least wasnt a thumb-sucker like this. Perhaps an even more apt choice would have been Diane Lane who played a similar character in the far shorter and more emotionally truthful ""Under the Tuscan Sun."" Even if you buy Roberts as an introspective writer (I didnt) theres no real sense of an emotional journey here. Any movie where the protagonists biggest problem is whether or not to split her time between New York and Bali is inherently going to be as profound as perfume. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next The killing fields Read Next The killing fields Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 42626 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21540 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 14896 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Media San Francisco Chronicle Eat Pray Love Comedy-Drama. Starring Julia Roberts Billy Crudup and Javier Bardem. Directed by Ryan Murphy. (PG-13. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Julia Roberts spends a lot of time meditating in ""Eat Pray Love"" and at a certain point the movie replicates the effects of meditation within the audience. About two-thirds into the film - probably during one of the hundred or so times someone tells our heroine that she should open up to love - my mind shut off. When it switched back on a minute later I didnt know the day or time or where I was or what movie was onscreen. ""Eat Pray Love"" had induced a state of pure undifferentiated being. This experience unique in a lifetime of moviegoing says something about the numbing quality of ""Eat Pray Love"" at its worst. It is 140 minutes long and repetitious beyond belief. Yet for all its weaknesses - unconscious contradictions travelogue simplicity and mix-and-match spirituality - ""Eat Pray Love"" is like its central character on a genuine quest. Its about something important the search for meaning and happiness about finding ones inner life amid the clutter and confusion of modern existence. Based on the memoir by Elizabeth Gilbert its the story of a successful writer (Roberts) who like Dante finds herself in her mid-thirties feeling lost and without direction. She ends her marriage to her sweet but hapless husband (Billy Crudup) and after the obligatory affair with a sensitive young hunk (James Franco of course) she decides to renew herself through travel. First shell go to Italy and enjoy good food. Then to India to pray in an ashram. And then to Bali to find love. Photo CTMG Inc.

Julia Roberts as ""Elizabeth Gilbert"" in Columbia Pictures EAT PRAY LOVE. Photo CTMG Inc. Image 9 of 9 Movie review {ldquo}Eat Pray Love{rdquo} 1 / 9 Back to Gallery Theres an irony here that the movie cant acknowledge without imploding the whole enterprise. Much of the message of ""Eat Pray Love"" is that people - success-driven Americans in particular - need to kick back enjoy themselves and let life in just let things happen. But Gilberts spiritual journey may be the most programmatic in history with realizations and discoveries planned in advance from a desk in New York City. Thinly veiled in Eastern robes ""Eat Pray Love"" is the ultimate American success story in which every warm human contact becomes grist for commerce. That we can push these dark thoughts aside is largely due to Julia Roberts who has never seemed so relaxed and at home with herself. She doesnt push has no underlying sense of aggrievement. She is instead a nice travel partner easy to take over a long long trip and we believe at all times that shes searching for happiness and not merely filling out a pre-packaged best-seller. The movie benefits also from Ryan Murphys sensitive and tasteful direction which finds subtle ways to illuminate and amplify Gilberts thoughts and emotions which are central to the story. Her dark night of the soul early in the film in which she decides to leave her husband is handled simply It takes place in the middle of the night with a languor and a quietness that distills a sense of aloneness and mental oppression. When the film switches to Rome Murphy uses the natural soundscape so that we can hear the unique sounds of that city. At times ""Eat Pray Love"" feels like Travel 101. When the Italians tell Liz for example about the Italian art of ""La dolce far niente"" - the sweetness of doing nothing - thats something you can hear five minutes into any Rick Steves or Samantha Brown travel video. Still the movie conveys a genuine feel for the mood and the sights of the city and in the end it does for Rome what Frances Mayes did for Tuscany. ""Eat Pray Love"" has three challenges it never completely overcomes. The first is that leaving Rome is never a good idea. The second is that much of the movie is about the spirit but you cant make drama out of someone meditating. The third is that for all its length and ambition the films spiritual insight is superficial. Lizs journey toward self-acceptance arguably borders on solipsism. Perhaps not accepting herself might have been a more enlightened first step. For all these reasons the India section sags woefully. But then things pick up in Bali with the arrival of Javier Bardem whos just more manly and elemental than Franco and Crudup definitely more suited to Roberts who looks like she could eat those other guys alive. ""Pray"" is rough going ideal for a bathroom break or a soul-renewing trance. But ""Eat"" and ""Love"" are cinema friendly. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations.

"Eat Pray Love Munch babble yawn | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEat Pray Love Munch babble yawnWith its too-glib portrayal of selfishness as a life choice Eat Pray Love ranks gluttony on a par with finding God and love.Were missing the essence of Liz Gilbert from her book in Julia Roberts onscreen portrayal in Eat Pray Love writes Peter Howell  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 12 2010Eat Pray Love (out of 4)Starring Julia Roberts Javier Bardem Billy Crudup James Franco and Richard Jenkins. Directed by Ryan Murphy. At major theatres. 140 minutes. PGWriters for the feminist magazine Bitch recently coined the term ""priv-lit"" to describe Elizabeth Gilberts empowerment epiphany Eat Pray Love her best-seller about finding yourself after divorce.The unflattering expression is short for ""literature of privilege"" implying enlightenment that has been bought rather than earned and it isnt entirely fair to the book. It misses Gilberts self-deprecating humor and her admission that shes far from perfect.Article Continued BelowBut its bang-on for the movie which glibly portrays selfishness as a life choice ranking gluttony on a par with finding God and a life partner.Gilbert describes herself in her confessional tome as a ""a professional American woman in my mid-thirties who has just come through a failed marriage and a devastating interminable divorce followed immediately by a passionate love affair that ended in sickening heartbreak.""This is not the woman we see in Julia Roberts portrayal. Her Liz walks away from an eight-year marriage to nice guy Stephen (Billy Crudup) with no real indication of emotional stress on her part. She does the same thing to her rebound amour David (James Franco) a man several years her junior who is also pretty decent. If theres any devastation or heartbreak here its almost entirely felt by the guys. Liz is an enigma muttering to David that ""I need to be unnerved."" Flashbacks of her time with Stephen and David popping up at jarring intervals serve only to make her seem all the more shallow.Liz blithely sallies forth to Rome her means of funding unclear (in the book its an authors advance). The trip is the first stage of a planned year-long odyssey to find ""balance"" which in director Ryan Murphys too-literal screen adaptation becomes an exhausting illustration of Gilberts profitable three verbs. It also happens to be the most enjoyable part of the movie if you can accept the ""eat"" sojourn in Rome as just a well-shot travelogue by an affluent foodie. Liz chows down on everything in sight enjoining various beautiful people to share her pizza teach her Italian and generally indulge her as she explores the meaning of the Italian expression dolce far niente which means ""the sweetness of doing nothing.""We must take it on faith that a woman as skinny as Roberts would or could eat as much Liz does without gaining any visible poundage (a jeans-squeezing moment in a shops changing room is a mere decoy). We also have to accept the howler that a sophisticated New Yorker would find the discovery of fresh spaghetti in Rome to be such a transcendent experience a Mozart aria would erupt in her head.This dubious devotion appropriately leads us to stage two the ""pray"" stage whereupon Liz is living in a Hindu ashram in India. Were not sure why she left her pals in Rome -- maybe she grew tired of transcendent pasta? -- or why she now fancies a spell of privation and meditation. Murphy and his co-writer Jennifer Salt presume that viewers of the film will have already read the book and thus dont require any explanations or segues apart from the Baby Boomer soundtrack of tunes (such as Neil Youngs ""Heart of Gold"" played during a golden moment) that are achingly on the nose.The ""why"" of Lizs ashram retreat also intrigues her fellow truth seekers especially a scruffy and bespectacled Texan named Richard (Richard Jenkins) who in a better movie could have been an interesting romantic focus.Despite some fine acting by Jenkins Richard comes across as a scold and nag whom privileged Liz naturally grows tired of ""Do you always speak in bumper sticker?"" she asks him. Good question but Liz should be looking in a mirror as she says it because shes also an ace at one-dimensional assessments. The only insight she seems to gain out of her daily prayer rituals is how hard it is to do them with all the mosquitoes buzzing around.Which leads us finally to ""love"" and the Indonesian island of Bali where Liz plays the indulgent and patronizing American tourist with the friendly and eccentric locals. This is also where it becomes glaringly apparent that this overlong film is running out of time to make a meaningful impact on Lizs life or ours.Moviegoers seduced by the trailer tease of Roberts making merry with the sexy Javier Bardem who plays the Felipe of the book are advised to bank down their enthusiasm since he doesnt appear until the 143 mark (by my watch) of this two-hour 20-minute movie.And when they do cross paths its in a ""meet cute"" moment more appropriate to cheap romantic comedy than a film that is supposedly operating at a higher emotional cerebral and spiritual level. It doesnt get any better. The one instance of genuine emotion between Liz and Felipe feels so out of place it could be in another movie.Twenty years ago even 10 years ago the role of Liz would have been played by Meryl Streep who has the rare gift of elevating insubstantial material a gift that Roberts lack. Roberts retains her magnetic smile and supernatural attraction to the camera looking a decade younger than her 42 years. Yet here shes unwilling -- perhaps unable? -- to allow herself to appear vulnerable enough to accept whatever messages food God or love are trying to send her.But thats Hollywood for you the great reducer of all things meaningful as director Murphy knows all too well.Hes the creator of two hit TV series Nip/Tuck and Glee both trading in the surface elements of appearance and pop culture worship.

"Movie review Eat Pray Love - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMovie review Eat Pray LoveBased on the bestseller the film follows a woman (Julia Roberts) who deals with a life crisis by traveling all over the world. Bring a tissue or two.August 13 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic If there is one constant in ""Eat Pray Love"" the imperfect yet beautifully rendered adaptation of Elizabeth Gilberts memoir on a year of heartbreak and healing starring Julia Roberts a it is this There will be tears.Happy tears sad tears tears of relief tears of regret gut-wrenching sobs really almost any variation imaginable a and thats just the guy in the next row who didnt think hed need Kleenex in a movie ever. So no need to blush if you find yourself getting teary nearly everyone in the movie a Roberts Javier Bardem Billy Crudup Viola Davis Richard Jenkins a cries before its over too.If anything it was the crying a and the catharsis that comes with it a that made such passionate fans of the book in the first place myself included. Despite (or because ofa|) all the education the career success the years of therapy the rich circle of friends and family Gilbert found herself still getting it completely wrong when it came to relationships with the men in her life. A thoroughly modern high-class problem that turned out to resonate deeply and widely. The movie hews so closely to all those emotional colors with Roberts breaking apart so completely and luminously as Liz that it is likely to touch that same chord.Just as the book turned out to be a perfect vehicle for Gilbert to work through all manner of emotional highs and lows the movie creates space and a place for Roberts to give into wave after wave of feelings as she moves through resentment guilt regret forgiveness joy and hope to change her life.In Ryan Murphy she seems to have the perfect director. Hes made a career of broken people bad relationships and fractured self-esteem quite brilliantly most notably on TV with ""Nip/Tuck"" and ""Glee."" And yes I know film and TV are very different mediums but thats not the problem here. Murphy wrings all of his actors emotionally dry scraping to the bone to expose vulnerability but he hasnt quite figured out how to control that power. So this gorgeous but messy affair isnt always as satisfying as it should be.The film basically begins where the book does with Liz Gilbert at 30 a successful writer with a handsome underachieving husband in Stephen (Crudup) a house in a posh New York suburb on her knees in the middle of the night sobbing a prayer to God to fix what is broken.The answer is a divorce which quickly turns catastrophic. Even a dreamy rebound lover named David played by James Franco cant break her depression. So Liz sets out on a yearlong search for balance and New Age-y enlightenment the sumptuous feast of Italy where food is the cure the meditative Indian ashram with Richard from Texas (Jenkins) as her spiritual advisor and the final months in Bali with the ministrations of local medicine man Ketut (Hadi Subiyanto) and a new romance with Felipe (Bardem).Meanwhile the canvas for all these mood swings has such a saturated beauty that it can bring you to tears too. Cinematographer Robert Richardsons (Oscar winner for ""The Aviator"" and ""JFK"") shots of pasta and pizza and the Italian cafes and countryside kitchens where Liz partakes will leave you desperate for a taste; the light filtering through the ashram bathes those scenes with an ethereal glow; the lush tropics of Bali through his lens turns up the heat though honestly with Bardem around you dont need it.But its not all perfection. ""Eat Pray Love"" was never going to be an easy adaptation given how interior a story Gilbert crafted. The books self-help self-absorbed qualities which made a publishing hit threaten sentimental mush on the big screen and there are times when the film comes close. A few characters have been streamlined others have been dropped but Murphy and screenwriting partner Jennifer Salt stay true to the spirit and construction of the source and that is part of what takes the film off track.Lizs inner voice which drives the book turns into extensive voice-over which Roberts handles well enough. But the conceit of narration cheats the character development time which would have made for a richer film. You feel this most acutely in Italy the first leg of the journey. The film never finds its footing there a theres virtually no connection between Liz and the cast of characters that flow into her life and almost no story. India however is made worthwhile by Jenkins an actor of extraordinary range who makes the folksy recovering Richard someone youd want to spend time reflecting with. Bali is saved by Subiyanto who is delightful as the smiling and nearly toothless ancient healer and Bardem whose potent screen presence makes anything look absolutely right for the moment.Any time Murphy pulls away from the book the film gets better. The scenes between Liz and her ex Crudups Stephen are intriguing and always welcome. In their flirts and their fights there is some of the crackling bite that Murphy can give dialogue when hes at his best and it hints at what might have been.It helps that Roberts rides all the turbulent waves with such ease and such grace that Jenkins knows exactly what to do with his internal churn and that Bardem can do no wrong. It makes the many tears worth it a or at least it will for those in the mood for a good cry and all those fans of the book who already knew to bring tissues.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESUp in the AirDecember 10 2009No healing X-Men review riftApril 7 2009Eagle flies in a phoenix careerSeptember 30 2008MORE STORIES ABOUTFilmBaliHappy TearsCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-eat-pray-love-20100813,0,7868980.story",200,eatpraylove16,eatpraylove,latimes

Columbia Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Aug. 13 2010 1201 a.m. ET During an early scene in a Manhattan laundromat the camera strays from Julia Robertss face long enough to notice a cautionary sign on a dryer Do Not Overload. I thought of that sign as ""Eat Pray Love"" moved to Italy India and Indonesia and the slender episodic story took on a sodden load of life lessons teachable moments nuggets of wisdom and mini-epiphanies. The film was directed by Ryan Murphy who made his mark on TV with ""Nip/Tuck"" and ""Glee."" He worked from a screenplay that he and Jennifer Salt adapted from Elizabeth Gilberts memoir of her year-long journey of discovery and self-discovery after a long lacerating divorce. As in the book the main stops along the way are Rome for a sensual feast of food and wine; an Indian ashram for prayerful enlightenment and transcendence and Bali for a balance between senses and spirit. Some of the heroines lesser discoveries translate nicely to the screen Flakes of parmesan cheese fall like slo-mo snow on a bed of spaghetti carbonara which Liz vacuums into her gullet with unrestrained zest. But the books internal dialogue that of a good observer with a lively mind has turned into the extravagantly external--glossy cinematography by Robert Richardson--and cloyingly earnest quest of a woman in deep distress. Watch a clip from ""Eat Pray Love"" a new film starring Julia Roberts. Video courtesy of Columbia Pictures. Liz is the most passive protagonist since Pu Yi in ""The Last Emperor."" Life swirls around her while she watches blissfully (in Italy) perplexedly (in India) or appreciatively (in Bali). People come and go though at each stop a crucial someone steps forward to serve as a guide. In Italy its Tuva Novotnys lovely Sofi a life-affirming--and movie-enlivening--tourist from Sweden. In India its a Texan played by Richard Jenkins a fine actor burdened with a didactic role that culminates in a maudlin speech about his family. In Bali its Hadi Subiyantos toothless medicine man and Christine Hakims quirky healer both of whom are delightful as a matter of fact because theyre interesting enough in their own right to distract from Lizs chronic seeking. Javier Bardem who was so hilarious as the twisted artist in ""Vicki Cristina Barcelona"" works terribly hard to be sensitive and charming as a Brazilian resident of Bali who may or may not prove to be Mr. Right. Its easy to make fun of all this sententiousness which is compounded by the movies 133-minute length or to forget what a formidable actress Ms. Roberts can be with the right material. (Her performance as Erin Brockovich was as far from passivity as Texas is from India.) And this material offers audiences a familiar and usually reliable formula of self-worth achieved through self-acceptance. Still ""Eat Pray Love"" preaches a sermon it doesnt practice--the need to open ones self to the world. In a pictorial sense this is exactly what Liz does; she vacuums up the transformative essence of three continents. Yet the world gets weirdly short shrift because this transcendently narcissistic movie is in a narrative sense almost entirely about Liz and the movie star who plays her. Spaghetti is there for her to eat sunsets are there for her to enjoy gurus are there for her to admire and she is there for the camera to dote on. The cast includes Viola Davis as Lizs editor Billy Crudup as the husband she sheds and James Franco as a soulful young actor who gets a role in a play based on one of her short stories. The play is awful though it isnt clear whether anyone knows it. Animal Kingdom ENLARGE James Frecheville Jacki Weaver and Dan Wyllie in Animal Kingdom. Sony Pictures Classic A phenomenal debut feature with a terrific title David Michods ""Animal Kingdom"" is both a study in Darwinian survival--in this case survival of the shrewdest--and a group portrait of ruthless predators in the underworld of Melbourne Australia. The spectrum of overt emotions is narrow; these creatures are neither touchy feely nor talky except for a scarily cheerful young grandmother who gets my vote as this years definitive incarnation of evil. Yet the film generates a steady-state sense of dread for the fate of its teenage hero Joshua surrounded as he is by bad relatives and bad cops who want to kill him. Watch a clip from the new film ""Animal Kingdom."" Video courtesy Sony Pictures Classics. Joshua nicknamed J is played by an appealing newcomer James Frecheville. The first shot finds him sitting impassively on a sofa next to his mother who has just died of a heroin overdose. Impassivity is the boys favored affect and its a comfortable fit with the malign calm of the crime family that takes him in--three uncles one of them only a few years older than he is and their mother Smurf a bleached-blonde virago with the face of an aging kewpie doll. (Shes played by the marvelous Jacki Weaver.) Behind Js penetrating eyes though a quick mind keeps making sharp assumptions that criminals however experienced are just as frightened as he is; that he can create a safe zone for himself only by playing one murderous group against another. Further Reading Director David Michod on the Origins of ""Animal Kingdom"" Actress Jacki Weaver on Playing the Role of ""Smurf"" Like many Australian films ""Animal Kingdom"" moves at a deliberate pace and its accents can be challenging for American ears. Still Mr. Michods saga which was shot elegantly by Adam Arkapaw fills a large canvas with startling moments and vivid details a police bust that isnt a bust at all but a grave unhurried dance in which all participants know their moves; a fascinating dissertation on the strong and weak of the animal kingdom--the one with actual animals in it--delivered by Guy Pearce who plays a decent cop devoted to Joshuas protection. The boy gives the cops a telling detail when he describes how one of his uncles cried after a friends death. He had ""water coming out of his eyes and he was rubbing them"" Joshua ventures hesitantly as if describing one of natures exotic mysteries. Lebanon If you think theres nothing more for the movies to say about wars madness think again and see ""Lebanon."" This short but shattering film written and directed by the Israeli filmmaker Samuel Maoz takes the narrowest possible view of Israels 1982 invasion of Lebanon. It allows us to see only what a four-man crew is able to see through a periscopic gun sight from inside an Israeli tank. And it forces us to feel at least a suggestion of what its like to be shut inside a steaming stinking lumbering chamber of steel that may at any moment incinerate its human contents. ENLARGE Zohar Strauss in Lebanon. Sony Pictures Classics Never before not even in the claustrophobic submarine epic ""Das Boot"" has a physical point of view so completely dictated a philosophical point of view. The tanks young citizen-soldiers inexperienced and terribly frightened cant see most of the destruction they inflict cant comprehend the political context of their campaign cant be sure where their treads have taken them and dont know how to save their own necks. (In ""Waltz With Bashir"" which serves as a perfect companion piece Israeli veterans of that war are so deep into repression that they cant remember what they did.) ""Lebanon"" cheats every now and then on the field of view showing us more than the gun sight could see and the Queeg-like disintegration of the young commander comes off as conventional and slightly glib. Still ""Lebanon"" clanks true. It goes beyond the fog of war into functional blindness. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS Conspiracy Theory (1997) ENLARGE Julia Roberts is Alice Sutton a flagrantly gorgeous federal prosecutor in this broad and thunderously entertaining elaboration of the old saw that even paranoids have enemies. The paranoiac in question is Mel Gibsons Jerry Fletcher a New York City taxi driver who rattles on about plots that range from the familiar (the New World Order presidential assassination) to the inventive (silent black helicopters operated by shadowy government agencies). Against all logic but that of summer action thrillers Alice sees Jerry correctly from the very start as a holy fool. Richard Donner directed from an original script by Brian Helgeland. Lantana (2001) ENLARGE A fine Australian feature that plays one crime-genre game for a while--although we know someone has been killed the question is who--and then once the victims identity has been revealed the more conventional game of whodunnit. But the extraordinary richness of the film which is set in Sydney and was directed by Ray Lawrence from a script by Andrew Bovell lies in its interlocking relationships--four married couples splitting off in various directions. And in the specificity of its characters--every one is an eventual revelation. The stars are Anthony LaPaglia Barbara Hershey and Geoffrey Rush. Waltz With Bashir (2008) ENLARGE Ari Folman a veteran of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 made this remarkable animated documentary after realizing how little he recalled of an experience that should have been as unforgettable as it was terrible. The witnesses he interviewed dont remember their time in Lebanon any better than he does. Yet his film is a signal success in charting the human minds gift for keeping bad memories at bay. War is hell as everyone claims to know but heres a baleful new perspective on the subject. Wars are fought the film tells us then literally forgotten.

Such a book is Elizabeth Gilberts Eat Pray Love.But theres a reason so many people - the vast majority women - have responded to the peripatetic memoir From the depths of depression from a marriage that was broken and a life that felt dead Gilbert rises up tries pasta in Italy meditation in India and a man in Indonesia - and comes away wiser and worldlier for her efforts.The writing is good - funny poignant precise - and even if her ephiphanies read like New Age bumper stickers they are real ephiphanies. Gilbert worked through pain to experience them. On an emotional level the book rings true.Which is not exactly how Eat Pray Love minus the commas and with Julia Roberts as the writer ""Liz"" Gilbert rings. Shot in burnished magic-hour light (the crew must have toiled feverishly over a hundred dawns and dusks) with rapturous attention paid to dishes of prosciutto and melon and to the dishy men in Lizs life (Billy Crudup as the husband she leaves James Franco as the rebound beau and finally Javier Bardem as the hopelessly sensitive sensual soulmate) the film is a glorious travelogue a charmer.But it lacks the resonances of Gilberts book. Sure Liz is glum and desperate as she stumbles around New York but a couple of close-ups of Roberts misting up and telling her aimless spouse that she wants out dont quite do the trick.Maybe its the Carrie Bradshaw voice-over narration or that Julia Roberts movie-star glow or the fact that director and cowriter Ryan Murphy opted to skirt the books darker terrains. But this Liz feels less like an urgently searching woman and more like a series of brushstrokes and sound bites a two-dimensional pilgrim. (Eat Pray Love the 3-D conversion?)And so after some hand-holding with a best friend (Viola Davis) some divorce proceedings with a lawyer and some sex with an actor (Franco) who appears in her Off-Off-Broadway play Liz gets out. The idea is to spend a year abroad trying to find balance independence and possibly God.First stop is Rome where Liz rents a photogenically distressed flat falls in with a handsome crowd of natives and ex-pats and discovers the glories of gelato the pleasures in pizza and the Italian concept of Il bel far niente the beauty of doing nothing.Like the book only more so it is the middle section - Lizs time in an ashram in India scrubbing floors and trying to get the noise out of her head - that feels weakest. Richard Jenkins chews up the scenery here playing an irrascible truth-telling Texan on his own spiritual quest. And theres Tulsi (Rushita Singh) a bright teenager set for an arranged marriage - Lizs heart goes out to her.And then for the final four months of her hegira its the rice paddies and rain forests of Bali. This is where Eat Pray Love in a brief prologue began Liz the travel writer meeting Ketut (Hadi Subiyanto) a Yoda-like medicine man who predicted that she would lose all her money but that she would gain it back (and how) live a long life find true love and return to Bali within the year to teach him English.Presto. Liz finds a beautiful open-walled house looking onto lush verdant gardens. Liz finds friends in a healer and her daughter. And Liz finds Felipe (Bardem) a Brazilian who exports Balinese bric-a-brac and who runs Liz down while shes riding her bike. He woos her. He wins her. And this being the true love that Ketut had spoken of she wins him too.Director Murphy of TVs ""edgy"" Nip/Tuck and of the hit series Glee turns out to be a pretty conventional filmmaker. Rome and Bali beautiful? Certainly. But even the squalor of India gets prettified and the characters Liz encounters along the way all say the right things in the right way even when theyre wrong.Perhaps in the hands of a more adventurous idiosyncratic director (think Jim Jarmuschs loping explorations) Eat Pray Love would have been something more than a slick and scenic synthesis of Gilberts book. Lives are messy. A little mess in the movie wouldnt have hurt at all.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Of course not. But if you cant find something to relate to here youre living a mighty charmed life.Thats what Roberts Gilbert thinks she has until she discovers she doesnt. The hastily staged opening moments find her fleeing a marriage (to Billy Crudup) and a rebound relationship (with James Franco) for an age-old cure the journey of self-discovery. Armed with a plan and enough cash to put it into action shes off to Italy (Eat) India (Pray) and Bali (Love) to find out who she really is and what she really wants. Movie Information Eat Pray LoveRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Ryan MurphyStarring Julia Roberts Richard Jenkins Javier Bardem Viola Davis Billy Crudup James Franco and Tuva NovotnyRun time 133 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (language sexuality brief nudity)Synopsis Julia Roberts stars as the author in this adaptation of the book by the same name.Video Chris Vognar in The Screening Room Eat Pray LoveMore movies from GuideLive.comGilberts book has haters as well as fans. Id guess that deep down we all want to take a spiritual globe-trotting trip but weve also been trained to see such luxuries as superfluous. The casting of Roberts helps here Shes eminently likable and by now shes such a familiar and savvy screen presence that we cut Gilbert slack and assemble in her corner with every subtle emotional response. Roberts face captures the transformation from tightly wound and dissatisfied soul to curious explorer. Whatever selfishness she displays - and a mission of self-knowledge is by definition selfish - is offset by the pleasures of watching her spirit soar.Eat Pray Love has an episodic structure and flow that can lead to some baggy narrative stretches; self-edification an internal process if ever there was one doesnt always make for riveting plot exposition. Director Ryan Murphy who has his own pop culture phenomenon in televisions Glee and ace cinematographer Robert Richardson bring visual energy to the already gorgeous sights not all of them epic landscapes. It seems a dollop of parmesan cheese looks even better when it falls on pasta like a mini snowstorm. (If you dont come to Eat Pray Love hungry youll definitely leave hungry.)Roberts is the obvious focus here but shes enough of a pro to get out of the way and let a scene be stolen. Richard Jenkins actually steals the entire Pray section as Richard from Texas (city unspecified) a fellow seeker who gently hectors Gilbert with aphoristic advice before finally breaking down and sharing his own shame. Its a perfectly played scene you can expect to see during next years supporting-actor Oscar montage. Javier Bardem sublimating some of his seductive swagger as a man wounded by divorce is also spot-on. The dudes fare quite well in this decidedly feminine movie.Eat Pray Love will continue to draw scorn from anyone quick to brandish the ""chick flick-chick lit"" label. It is what it is. But as a newbie to the phenomenon a film critic with an X and Y chromosome I got caught up in the modern sensibility of this rare female quest movie. If it feels a little touristy - the motif of wise ethnic sages wears pretty thin - thats because Gilbert was a tourist. As played by Roberts a genuine movie star who keeps growing as an actress shes also a guide worth following. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Word of advice to anyone planning a global in-search-of-self trot Dont cram your suitcase so full that you smother your goal. Elizabeth Gilberts memoir ""Eat Pray Love"" spoke deeply to many of its 7 million readers. After divorcing her husband Liz traveled to Italy an Indian ashram and Bali learning as much about herself as her destinations. The film versions biggest challenge? The road to self-discovery is littered with cliches. Julia Roberts new movie does a lot of things right avoiding preachiness the typical saccharine soundtrack and cultural stereotyping though a salty-tongued Roman landlady -- ""All you American girls want is pasta and [wink wink] sausage"" -- and a smiling-raisin Balinese wise man dance close to the edge. Liz a successful New York writer with a pretty darn enviable life somehow appears more sympathetic than whiny when she tells her pal (the perennially underused Viola Davis) ""I need a change I have no pulse my appetite for life is gone."" Much has been made of ""Eat Pray Love"" being the antidote not only to male-driven summer blockbusters but to such ode-to-womanhood misfires as ""Sex and the City 2"" and ""The Women"" (the remake). That it is but we shouldnt hail a flawed though fun effort as perfection just because were parched for its themes. Some reflections of real middle-aged womens lives that are refreshing if not astonishing to see on a big screen A husband (Billy Crudup) doesnt have to be an abusive monster or serial adulterer for a woman to fall out of love with him. A rebound guy -- even one as adorable as James Franco -- can be just that no more. A woman dining alone in a romantic piazza isnt a tragic figure. And a woman blithely accepting her muffin-top (suspend disbelief Julia Roberts does not have one) without a trace of self-disparagement could be a first in American cinema. Francois Duhamel Columbia Pictures Julia Roberts is as luminous as ever but its co-star Richard Jenkins who really shines. But wheres the deft insertion of humor we expect from director Ryan Murphy the Hollywood hot property behind the hit television series ""Glee"" and ""Nip/Tuck""? Most jokes fall flat especially a visual one that compares women rejoicing over being able to zip up too-tight jeans to men cheering a soccer game score -- a Euro-Sex and the City moment if ever there was one. Roberts is as engaging luminous and resistant to criticism as ever but Oscar nominee Richard Jenkins (""The Visitor"") runs away with the best performance by several lengths. As a Texan in recovery who befriends Liz at an ashram -- calling her ""Groceries"" because of her healthy appetite -- Jenkins also scores the biggest tearjerker scene. Underneath his wisecracks (""The first rule in India is the only thing you touch is yourself"") writhes a heart far more broken than Lizs. Javier Bardem who has never more closely resembled a sensitive bull painted by Picasso (Blue Period) does his best with the limitations of his rushed role. By the time Liz gets to Bali she must fall in love inexplicably lash out at Bardem then reconsider at the speed of light. Unlike Liz the filmmakers dont stretch their boundaries enough to truly satisfy. With this story and cast they could have gone for glory but settled for so-so with sprinkles on top by trying to squeeze in too much of the book. It may be too much to expect for one mass-market film to offer more than sample-size enlightenment. But it does deliver a lot of what audiences want more of the chance to compare Lizs self-made traps and strong but unspecified yearnings to their own. After Jenkins character notices Liz looking sad at a Hindu wedding he guesses correctly ""Thinking about yours? Funny thing about weddings they always make you think of yourself."" So does this film. Before setting off for the other side of the world restless Liz says ""I need to be unnerved."" Who doesnt? Pity the husband or boyfriend who opts to see the weekends other big release the machofest ""The Expendables"" instead of EPL-ing it with his mate. Hell be blindsided when she comes home from the theater to announce ""Im going on a trip. A long one. Alone.""

Comments (5) Eat Pray Love Free Video Rated PG-13  140 minutes  2010 How can a romantic drama tailor-made for Julia Roberts from Elizabeth Gilberts best-selling memoir about self-actualization--shot against alluring locales in Italy India and Bali and directed by the acclaimed Ryan Murphy (TVs Nip/Tuck and Glee)--go so ass-numbingly wrong? Beyond Viola Davis who spins her underwritten role as the heroines loyal confidant into a resonant supporting turn and Javier Bardem (playing the only three-dimensional man in the movie) few of the characters are sympathetic Roberts as divorced author/journalist Gilbert could freeze a meteor with her steely reserve Billy Crudup as her first husband flounders amid embarrassing cliches the usually incandescent James Franco is wasted as her shallow lover and the great Richard Jenkins alienates as the bully she meets in an ashram. As for the painfully preachy script only hard-core fans of Oprahs BFF will be able to stomach this navel-gazing tripe which posits ""me-first"" consumerism as the road to happiness.

In Italy she ate and learned the language; in India she joined an ashram and meditated. In Bali her final destination she planned to devote herself to prayer studying under a wizened medicine man named Ketut. Instead she fell in love with a Brazilian businessman achieving inner peace and a happy ending for the memoir she was already under contract to write. That book Eat Pray Love was released in 2006 and went on to become a publishing phenomenon selling more than 7 million copies worldwide. (See the 100 best books of all time.) Most women brave enough to set out on such an adventure might come back with a diary theyd be obliged to call Eat Pray Dysentery. The symmetry of that convenient love capping off the year -- Gilbert is now married to the man she met in Bali whom she calls Felipe in that book and this years best-selling sequel Committed -- is a bit hard to swallow for some of us. Its fairy-tale quality the one by which a womans quest ends with a man seemed less like real life and more like a Julia Roberts movie. Which is why I found myself rather happily anticipating Eat Pray Love the big-screen version of Gilberts book directed by Glee and Nip/Tuck creator Ryan Murphy. (He shares a screenplay credit for the movie with Jennifer Salt.) Now that Eat Pray Love had lost its commas and become a movie actually starring Julia Roberts I was no longer annoyed by how much it seemed like one; it had assumed its rightful place in the entertainment universe. (See pictures of Glees Broadway roots.) With a running time of 140 minutes that feels even longer the film is hardly the playful frolic youd hope for from Murphy whose Glee is often 42 of the most joyous minutes on television. But Gilbert devotees should be thrilled with the film. Eat Pray Love is a lushly photographed adaptation that glosses over some details (like the fact that Liz got an advance to write about her spiritual journey) and takes the liberty of creating a sensible best-girlfriend character Lizs publisher Delia (the no-nonsense Viola Davis). But its otherwise a faithful rendering of Gilberts text. The food styling is sumptuous -- I will dream of something I took to be a zucchini blossom oozing cheese -- and the stunning locations include many of the places Gilbert actually frequented among them Ketuts house in Bali. (The medicine man is played by Hadi Subiyanto a flute player the filmmakers found in Jakarta.) (See more about Eat Pray Love tourism in Bali.) As for Roberts shes just right for the role of Gilbert who is also tall and pretty and charismatic. Roberts looks fetching devouring pizza. She looks fetching in various sacklike ethnic outfits. She graciously allows herself to be shot looking haggard although these images are usually closely followed by a demonstration of her breathtaking luminosity in say a to-die-for sari. (Outfits jewelry and furnishings from the film as well as goodies like Eat Pray Love-inspired soap are available for sale on the Home Shopping Network.) And when her brown eyes well up with tears of gratitude empathy or fear -- as they often do -- rather than making Liz seem like a crybaby they convey a deep psychic wound one the universe really should heal if it has any decency. Have Ex Will TravelYet its a vaguely sourced wound and her angst has a tepid quality even though Lizs rationales for being a runaway wife and girlfriend are more fleshed out here than in Gilberts frustratingly discreet memoir. As Felipe (Javier Bardem) says after shes rejected his offer of a romantic vacation on a desert isle ""Whats the problem Liz?"" The same question might cross the minds of moviegoers. Lizs ex-husband Stephen (Billy Crudup) is no obvious villain just a feckless sort who by his own admission has a tendency to get ""sidetracked"" (one semester of law school some fleeting culinary experience now pondering a masters in education).

(Columbia Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday August 11 2010 400 AM Title Eat Pray Love If youre reading this review youre far more likely to be sitting on a subway or stuck at your desk than sampling gelato on a cobblestone street in Rome. And that means youre probably way overdue for a vacation. If you dont already have one planned ""Eat Pray Love"" will serve as a satisfactory substitute. No the air-conditioned breeze of a movie theater wont rival a wind-blown beach in Bali. But on a sticky August day in New York we take what we can get. What we get here is a well-meant if not exactly transcendent adaptation of Elizabeth Gilberts beloved Oprah-endorsed memoir. As every book-clubber in the country is no doubt aware director Ryan Murphy achieved a major casting coup in landing Julia Roberts to play Gilbert - or Liz as shes called here.As it turns out though a lesser star may have been a better choice. Murphy appears so awed by Roberts that he encourages her to glide through the film like the icon she is literally shining a golden halo of light around her wherever she goes. This is a bit of a problem since the storys core begins with an emotional meltdown. After divorcing her flaky husband (Billy Crudup) and briefly moving in with a flaky actor (James Franco) a depressed Liz impetuously decides to take a trip around the world. Shes not entirely sure what shes looking for but shes hoping to find it somewhere along the way.Her first stop is Rome where her Italian tutor teaches her the art of doing nothing. Like any hardworking New Yorker shes resistant to this philosophy at first. But before long shes happily gained 10 pounds on a steady diet of pasta and pizza. Murphy shoots the food as lovingly as he does his leading lady so expect some serious carb envy on this portion of the trip.When its time for spiritual nourishment Liz moves on to an Indian ashram. Again it takes a while for her to figure out why shes there. But she gets essential guidance from a tough-talking gentle-hearted new friend named Richard (Richard Jenkins in the films standout turn). Finally when shes achieved some personal balance shes ready to relax in Bali. Here she meets Felipe (Javier Bardem). Hes recently divorced as well and equally reluctant to get involved in any serious entanglements. But of course theres a reason this part of the itinerary is called ""Love.""Murphy and his co-writer Jennifer Salt do indeed capture the heart of Gilberts book which is the need for both inner and external love. But they never quite get a handle on its soul the deep spiritual emptiness that sends Liz searching in the first place. In an effort to pack everything in they rush through the beginning so we dont really see the dark place from which Liz begins this journey. Without that foundation its a little difficult to understand what shes running from or even toward. Since Roberts neglects to explore the gritty underside of Lizs emotions we cant build the same bond Gilbert encourages in her book. Still the locations are lush the costumes vibrant the varying moods properly atmospheric. And the truth is Gilberts book wasnt a runaway smash because it told the story of the woman who wrote it but because it reflected the stories - or fears or fantasies - of the women who read it. In other words take what you need even if it isnt everything you want. There are plenty of reasons most of us wont go on an international trip this summer. So for certain would-be travelers an afternoon spent wandering between Italy India and Indonesia - not to mention Crudup Franco and Bardem - is bound to come as a welcome escape.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Eat Pray Love | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; eat-pray-love ) Eat Pray Love (United States 2010) August 11 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Eat Pray Love is a muddle of a film - an overlong bore that either mistakenly thinks its something more than a humdrum romance or has incorporated a variety of pretentions as window-dressing. In either case the movies quasi-preachy attitude effectively counterbalances whatever charm Julia Roberts brings to the proceedings. Eat Pray Loves trite platitude-laden ""philosophy"" embraces concepts perfect for our post-modern society God lies within self-forgiveness is the road to enlightenment and it doesnt matter how many people you hurt as long as youre happy in the end. The movie is banal; the underlying doctrine is dubious. Now I can understand why the source material has received as much scorn as it has inspired devotion. Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) is going through a mid-life crisis. She is bored with her upper middle class Manhattan lifestyle and wants to do something else but like an indecisive college student she doesnt know what. So she dumps her devoted husband Stephen (Billy Crudup) and takes up with a young hunky actor (James Franco). If you dont dislike the lead character by this point give it time - that will come. Eventually she tires of the actor and heads overseas to find herself. Her first stop is Rome where she spends four months indulging one of the deadly sins gluttony. Then its off to India to live in an ashram and learn how to meditate. There she meets Richard from Texas (Richard Jenkins) whose revelations about his own sad life show Liz the path to enlightenment. Finally she travels to Bali where she hangs around a fortuneteller and falls for a sexy Brazilian Felipe (Javier Bardem) who like Liz isnt looking for love when it finds him. Its hard to decide which is Eat Pray Loves least appealing and most appalling quality its needless 135-minute running time its mealy philosophizing or the deplorable nature of the lead character. In general terms theres no rule that a protagonist has to be likeable but in Lizs case its obvious we are intended not merely to like her but to identify with her. The casting of Julia Roberts is intended to stack the deck. One doesnt hire this particular actress to play a shallow self-absorbed woman unless the intention is for us to accompany her on an amazing transformative journey. Although that may be the intention it isnt what happens perhaps because such a spiritual apotheosis is difficult for even the most accomplished director to convey (a category in which Ryan Murphy whos currently embroiled in the TV series Glee does not fit). What we end up with is an individual whos not fundamentally different at the end than at the beginning and whom were supposed to forgive because a few throw-away cut scenes show that the people she discarded are living happy lives without her. In many ways the central philosophy of Eat Pray Love (the movie) which may or may not be governed by the guiding principles spelled out in Elizabeth Gilberts book fits well with todays ""me-first"" attitude. The story focuses on self-gratification self-fulfillment and self-discovery. Its all about ""self"" even though there are times when a little self-abnegation is needed to get to the finish line. Id be less irritated by the movies philosophical foundation if it avoided sermonizing. Are the filmmakers seeking viewers or converts? Roberts does her best to make Liz appealing but its a losing battle. She smooths some of the rough edges which serves to make the protagonist bland and unmemorable rather than detestable. There are some interesting secondary characters most of whom are on screen for far too little time. The best of these is Richard from Texas who is played with dignity by character actor Richard Jenkins. The scene in which Richard conveys his sad history represents the best five minutes in the movie and nothing else comes close. Javier Bardem is stuck in the thankless role of the love interest and he doesnt appear until the movie has overstayed its welcome. Watching him I couldnt help wishing hed pull out the oxygen tank and use it on Liz. When it comes to employing exotic locales as a backdrop for a character-based story Murphy could learn a thing or two from Rubba Nada whose Cairo Time successfully interweaves travelogue elements into a narrative-based feature. The best Eat Pray Love does is to incorporate some throw-way establishing shots. In Cairo Time I felt like I was in Egypt. In Eat Pray Love I felt like I was thumbing through the photo album of someone who spent some time in Italy (eat) India (pray) and Indonesia (love). Perhaps the most damning indictment I can offer regarding Eat Pray Love is that its interminable. As the running time stretches toward what seems to be infinity the average viewer is likely to glance and his or her watch with increasing frequency. Occasional taps on the face are understandable because the minute hand may seem to either be moving too slowly or to have stopped altogether. Perhaps members of the films target demographic of which I am not a member will immerse themselves with wistful pleasure in what Eat Pray Love offers. If so good for them. For me the problem isnt the estrogen overdose its the attempted indoctrination into a philosophy I find repugnant.

As it becomes clear shes dead his eyes continually habitually veer back to the stupid game show on TV. First-time writer/director David Michod limns a dank and lost family history in just these few barely conscious gestures. The alienated teen is Joshua (James Frecheville) who with nowhere else to go moves in with his garrulous grandmother Smurf and is accepted into her roiling nest of pathology. This chintzy suburban house is where up to half of the movie plays out dominated by Smurfs three sons Darren (Luke Ford) a surly post-teen visibly uneasy with following the family line; Craig (Sullivan Stapleton) a tattooed coke brute; and Pope (Ben Mendelsohn) the oldest a bank robber off his meds and hiding out from the fuzz. With Joshuas narration the template is GoodFellas but without the crescendos. No speeding bullet Michods film luxuriates in its own exaggerated sense of tragedy observing the family as it self-destructs under pressure. But the directors strenuous efforts to accumulate tension are often only just that. Still Animal Kingdom is a work of obvious ambition and seeing a debut filmmaker swing for the fences like this is its own kind of satisfaction. (Michael Atkinson) (Arclight Hollywood AMC Century City) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - EAT PRAY LOVE Lusciously shot by Oscar winner Robert Richardson (The Aviator JFK) Eat Pray Love delivers a sensory overload as intense as Inceptions but heavily calibrated to stir the hearts loins and tear ducts of women for whom love handles and spiritual bankruptcy are of equally pressing concern. Julia Roberts Liz leaves behind flaky husband Billy Crudup and ""Yonkers yogi"" boy-toy James Franco to embark on a yearlong solo walkabout with stops in Italy India and Bali. Writer/director Ryan Murphy keeps emotional currents bubbling on the surface serving up near-constant catharsis but hardly any arc -- the title is a spoiler in three parts. As vicarious travelogue EPL stumbles by flattening its loaded locations into (beautifully photographed) set dressing. Politics and economics hardly exist; each place is populated chiefly by wise exotics who talk funny (including Richard Jenkins Texan in the ashram) and exist solely to spout slogans and tell stories that make Lizs problems seem small. ""Believe in love again"" ""Americans know entertainment but not pleasure"" ""It wont last forever -- nothing does"" Lizs happily-ever-after hookup with hunky divorce Javier Bardem should be EPLs glorious guilty-pleasure crescendo; instead its a rushed foregone conclusion. Though targeted to the same female filmgoers who flocked to the self-realization via food porn of Julie amp; Julia EPL is a comparative downer letting viewers experience the rush of self-improvement without having to do any of the work. I cried. Mission accomplished? (Karina Longworth) (Citywide)THE EXPENDABLES ""If the moneys right we dont care where the job is."" So explains Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) the leader of hired-gun task force the Expendables. This credo lands Ross and his team (Jason Statham Dolph Lundgren Jet Li Randy Couture and Terry Crews in ""the Carl Weathers Memorial Role"") in the Gulf of Aden as our story begins. Somali pirates staging a videotaped decapitation are pinned down by dancing laser sights -- and soon the baddies are ripped apart. A human trunk splats against the wall and star/director/co-screenwriter Stallone slaps his cards on the table. Tipped by the presence of Rocky IV nemesis Lundgren and cameo favors called in from Planet Hollywood The Expendables is a throwback to 80s run-and-gun action when Hollywood gym rats made boffo box office depopulating Third World countries. Pirates liquidated the Expendables next mission concerns the fate of the South American nation of Vilena where Generalissimo Garza grinds the populace beneath his iron heel. Garza is torn between his imperialist backers (Eric Roberts and bodyguard ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin) and his idealistic daughter. As in Stallones last Rambo where a good-hearted Christian woman resurrected John Rambos wrath to the woe of the Burmese junta the daughters vague Hope gives the Expendables a purpose. Though The Expendables does not have that Rambos ... let us call it focus it tries manfully to top that films kill-em-all climax. If The Expendables is no classic for about 20 minutes it blowed up real good. (Nick Pinkerton) (Citywide)GO  MUGABE AND THE WHITE AFRICAN The idea of a film pleading the cause of white landowners in the new Africa might make you roll your eyes. But if theres one dictator whose thuggery and contempt for his own people cant be written off as a legacy of colonialism its Robert Mugabe whose despotic chaotic 30-year rule of Zimbabwe has brought the country to its knees. Shot undercover by British filmmakers Lucy Bailey and Andrew Thompson this incendiary documentary showcases Mugabes corrupt use of land reform to further polarize a fragile nation already divided along racial lines by following an elderly white farmers struggle to avoid being forced off the land he bought in 1978. Trying to bring their case before an international tribunal in Namibia Mike Campbell and his son-in-law Ben Freeth find themselves stonewalled intimidated and finally horrifically beaten and tortured by Mugabes hoodlums. At times the film glides over salient questions It would help for example to know how much Campbell pays the black workers he calls his ""community"" and who he concedes risk their lives daily in his employ. But as his extraordinarily brave black female attorney points out at stake are not merely the rights of this family or indeed of all white farmers but the future of race relations and human rights in Africa.

Sep. 13 600pm MUNDO ALAS Following a group of handicapped Argentine musicians as they embark on a 2007-08 national tour under the stewardship of famed folk artist Leon Gieco Mundo Alas (co-directed by Gieco) presents feel-good sentimentality without depth or nuance. Taking multiple pages from the Spellbound populist-documentary handbook the film sets its stage with cursory snapshots of its various players -- including a wheelchair-bound dancer a singer with no arms or legs and a tango troupe whose members have Down syndrome -- which reveal scant details about their personalities and day-to-day realities and even fewer specifics regarding how they came to be associated with Gieco in the first place. Actual insight into these peoples hearts and minds is replaced with skin-deep montages of cheery tour-bus road-tripping hanging out with friends and writing songs in the studio. The performances which culminate with a show at the famed Luna Park are stirring enough to make the portraits superficiality all the more pronounced the musicians accomplishments undercut by the fact that Gieco avoids depicting any genuine adversity. Instead what his road movie offers is merely nonfiction comfort food that packages his inspiring subjects stories into an easy formulaic triumph-of-the-spirit template. (Nick Schager) (Sunset 5)GO  PEEPLI LIVE First widely reported in the 90s an ongoing suicide epidemic in central India has claimed the lives of several tens of thousands of farmers too miserably destitute to go on in part because their families are thereafter bestowed with a piddling government grant of about 2000. In first-time filmmaker Anusha Rizvis amusingly bittersweet satire bushy-haired introvert Natha (Omkar Das Manikpuri one newcomer in a cast of mostly rural locals) fears his land will soon be seized due to an unpaid loan and is coerced by his older brother into offing himself for the financial good of his family. Another villager overhears the plan and tells someone else the escalating game of ""Telephone"" pulling in the scoop-hungry national media nervous bureaucrats and two rival politicians who are leveraging the issue for electoral gain. The grand joke of it all less subversively executed than in Alexander Paynes all-eyes-on-one-pawn farce Citizen Ruth is that nobody has bothered asking poor Natha what he really wants. Its an unusual taste of mainstream Indian cinema (or thanks to superstar Aamir Khans production company its a small film given an unusually mainstream push) unexpectedly irreverent with an earthier folkier sound track than the typical Bollywood electro-bounce. (Aaron Hillis) (Citywide)TALES FROM EARTHSEA This 2006 Ghibli Studios adaptation of the Ursula K. Le Guin novels is the handiwork of first-timer Goro Miyazaki son of Hayao -- and the lack of the masters poetic control shows. Miyazaki movies (Howls Moving Castle Spirited Away) are always bewitched by dream logic but this cookie-cutter fantasy saga -- a good wizard and bad wizard battle over the karmic ""balance"" of the titular kingdom with a troubled prince caught in the middle -- is slack and often incomprehensible full of vague magical rules and eruptions of nonsense without explanation. There are dragons but to no significant purpose; nightmares about tar; out-of-nowhere body/spirit schisms occurring only for plot convenience; and so on. Goro Miyazaki lacks his fathers charm and humor though he obviously worked the studios army of background painters to the bone creating yet another gorgeous medieval Eurocity. Despite the Willem Dafoe-whispered androgynously evil mage and the incongruous presence of Cheech Marin dubbing the villains head lackey Earthsea seems to be a stupendously dull place. It would try the patience of any kid. (Michael Atkinson) (Landmark W.L.A.) Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact LA Weekly Follow LA Weekly laweekly L.A.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + There has been some debate about what to call ""Eat Pray Love. Is it a romantic comedy? Is it a chick flick? This is silly since in truth its neither. Its simply a Julia Roberts movie often a lovely one. As Sylvester Stallone clings to relevance in ""The Expendables how shocking to see this 42-old-year woman work at the height of her charm and without the aid of nostalgia and cluster bombs.We seem never to tire in the debate over whether we love Roberts. This has been true for the 20 years since ""Pretty Woman. And in an age in which nothing seems to last that this woman still inspires houses of worship and camps of disdain is both a relief and a cause for celebration. She opts to carry so few movies that one with only her name above the title qualifies as an event.This event is not one to see on an empty stomach or even on a stomach full of dubious calories. A simple bowl of spaghetti that appears here makes a cardboard tray of nachos seem rather cruel. So does the sight of Roberts twirling her fork around the bowl. But its a moment that satisfies several appetites the hunger for a good meal on the one hand; the hunger for a real personality on the other. Its hard to beat the ecstasy of seeing Americas greatest working movie star blissfully -- not to mention bravely -- shove that meal in her mouth.What the box office says is one thing. What the camera sees is something else. And what the camera sees in Roberts more now than ever is a woman who at the dawn of middle age has ripened into an actor alluringly at ease with her sensuality. (It started last year in ""Duplicity.) For proof there she is in this new movie doing nothing more than sitting on the floor in a negligee with a plate of food. In that moment its all the sex anybody needs.""Eat Pray Love is based on Elizabeth Gilberts hit 2006 memoir about the trip she took to Italy India and Bali after her marriage ended. The object was for a recently depressed extrovert to try being alone with a broken heart and busted spirit. She winds up creating a lot of new friendships anyway. The book was brisk vague glib and a touch smug. Its wild popularity was partly because Gilbert had turned her highly relatable emotional crisis into a kind of fairy tale of self-actualization. The best thing about it was the exuberance of the writing and reading Gilbert alternately praise and pan herself the only voice I heard was Robertss.The movie dials back both the books self-congratulation and its sense of unhappiness. Roberts for once has no sharp comebacks or nasty stares or tirades to rescue her. Here shes not smarter about life than everyone she meets. Often shes just as confounded by it as the rest of us. Shes not wise or scheming or better than you. Shes almost unrecognizably vulnerable yet often characteristically happy. This is the only star I can think of whose laugh -- that braying honk -- is so contagious. The television impresario of the moment Ryan Murphy (""Nip/Tuck ""Glee) adapted the memoir with Jennifer Salt a writer and producer on ""Nip/Tuck. His previous film adapted another memoir Augusten Burroughss ""Running With Scissors. Aside from a ferocious piece of acting from Annette Bening it was a lot of soundtrack and art direction. ""Eat Pray Love is more successful. Youd never know it from his shows but Murphy has a natural enough sense of how people talk observe and affect each other. The occasional silences are welcome too. Theres an early scene in which Elizabeth -- everyone calls her Liz -- begs God to tell her what to do and all you hear are sobs rain and the roll of thunder.The films New York stretches feature Liz and her diffident soon-to-be ex-husband (Billy Crudup) and Lizs rebound relationship with an actor (James Franco). Neither man ever seems right for Liz or for Roberts whose radiance is something few actors can completely absorb without vanishing. Viola Davis as Lizs literary agent handles that fine but shes stuck sadly with another best-friend part.By far the section set in Italy is the movies best -- and not simply because of the food or the joy Roberts shows in eating it. Murphy surrounds Liz with Italians who tutor her in both the language of words and the body. This is the movie in which Roberts finally learns to use her hands. Luca Argentero Tuva Novotny Andrea Di Stefano and the marvelously rotund Giuseppe Gandini play her circle of friends. And its fun watching Roberts out of her element acclimating to strangers as expressive as she is.The trips to the Indian ashram and Balinese village that follow have their moments -- many of them from the casting department. At the ashram Richard Jenkins shows up as a Texan who nicknames Liz ""Groceries for her big appetite and Rushita Singh as a teenager with broken glasses on the verge of an arranged marriage. Bali produces first the wonderful Hadi Subiyanto as her toothless psychic friend then Javier Bardem as a toothsome Brazilian suitor.These passages prove that its possible to film a luminous white American abroad amid various brown people without turning sanctimonious or downright ugly. These are gentle scenes inflected with the comedy and poignancy of human connection as well as news of something called quest physics. But it all makes the movie feel somewhat eternal too. Of course its hard to protest too much. Roberts doesnt work often enough to overstay her welcome. At the moment the only person eating more delectably in Italy is Tilda Swinton in ""I Am Love.I just wished Murphy had better fleshed out the contours of Lizs thinking toward the end. Only in the movies does her final choice make emotional sense. But isnt that where we are the movies? And isnt this where wed like to see Roberts more? At some point the rotund Roman -- Luca Spaghetti no less -- tells Liz that the difference between Italians and Americans is that Italians like pleasure and Americans like entertainment. Too true. But watching Roberts squeeze herself into a pair of jeans or kick her heels in the air this American has rarely felt more Italian.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

ABOUT THE MOVIEEat Pray Love   (out of four) Stars Julia Roberts Javier Bardem James Franco Billy CrudupViola Davis Mike OMalleyDirector Ryan MurphyDistributor Columbia PicturesRating PG-13 for brief strong language some sexual references and nudityRunning time 2 hours 13 minutesOpens at midnight in select cities and nationwide Friday By Claudia Puig USA TODAY In Eat Pray Love Julia Roberts communes with an elephant is counseled by a toothless medicine man and eats a lot of pasta. Its a Roman/Indian/Indonesian holiday in which Roberts as journalist Elizabeth Gilbert searches her soul ad nauseam -- in an ashram among the ruins and in a remote lush landscape that looks like Club Med. Its a thin story on paper as well as on screen. A privileged woman ends her marriage for vague reasons and decides to get in touch with her true self. She ventures to Italy for the cuisine goes to India to meditate and finds love in Indonesia. The whole quest feels a bit forced though its an appealing travelogue. TRAILER Get a taste of Eat Pray Love AILING Eat Pray Love fortuneteller hospitalized RED CARPET REPORT From the Eat Pray Love premiere PHOTOS Julia Roberts pictures galore The soul-searching is glib Liz absorbs aphorisms and spouts truisms as if she has unlocked the mystery of life. In India Liz accuses fellow traveler and searcher Richard (an affable Richard Jenkins) of ""speaking in bumper stickers."" The same could be said of the entire screenplay. Anyone who has read Gilberts best-selling book already knows the dimensions of her personal analysis and philosophy. Roberts is often charming as she brings the sometimes-unsympathetic Liz to life but the film as directed by Ryan Murphy spends too much time in long close-ups of her troubled face misty-eyed or deep in contemplation. A little navel-gazing goes a long way. Murphy the creator/writer/director of TVs Nip/Tuck and Glee is an unusual directorial choice. But theres not much glee and plenty of overwrought despair surrounding Liz for the first half-hour of the movie. Roberts strikes convincing sparks with the charismatic James Franco who plays David a struggling actor and Gilberts first lover after the dissolution of her marriage. Lizs husband Stephen (Billy Crudup) is an unpredictable and lovesick puppy lacking in personality and career direction. But the movie gives the character a bit more dimension than Gilbert does in the book. After Elizabeth meditates in India her final destination is Indonesia where she reconnects with dentally challenged sage Ketut (Hadi Subiyanto). She also meets Felipe a strapping and warmhearted Brazilian played winningly by Javier Bardem. Murphy tries to fill in the storys blanks with a few too many montages and shots of exotic locales as seen from the heavens. Though there are a handful of funny lines the deeper observations are facile. The whole journey feels like a rich girl gone slumming. And for those of us along for the ride its a bit of a slog.

"Eat Pray Love easy to watch hard to love - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 starsEat Pray Love easy to watch hard to loveAugust 12 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic2 stars It is easy to watch ""Eat Pray Love"" the pretty languid film adaptation of Elizabeth Gilberts best-selling journal of self-discovery. Sun-drenched close-ups of asparagus drizzled just so on a plate next to very good-looking bread in Rome aaaaah. A Balinese beach with Julia Roberts gazing out upon it oooooh. Javier Bardem at the end of the protagonists yearlong journey waiting tasty. Director and co-adapter Ryan Murphys film will likely do the trick for a good percentage of those who loved Gilberts memoir. The movie has the advantage of getting more fun as it goes. Because if theres one truism in life its that sex with Bardem in Bali is more fun than celibacy on an ashram in India. Some though may find themselves struggling to engage with Gilbert as a character. While Murphy has a shrewd commercial instinct (hes largely responsible for ""Nip/Tuck"" and ""Glee"" on TV) he couldnt do a thing to save the film version of ""Running With Scissors."" Some of that same shiny phoniness creeps through here. The very elements of ""Eat Pray Love"" that helped make it a success in 40 languages -- the breezy prose the relentless sorting-through of dissatisfactions a steady stream of intriguing sights -- turn the film into a travelogue with a little spiritual questing on the side. Nothing is made too sticky for Manhattan travel writer Liz played by Roberts. Her marriage to a charming flake ( Billy Crudup) has gone cold and she gets up the nerve to move on and out. Her rebound lover ( James Franco) steers her toward a spiritual path while Lizs friend and confidant ( Viola Davis) wonders if the heroine is simply getting lost in an indulgent haze of restlessness. First stop Rome where its all about food and pining for love. Then on an ashram in India Liz digs into herself with the aid of a fellow traveler from Texas. This man is played by Richard Jenkins as reliable a character actor we have in movies today. Murphy has the sense to shoot his confessional monologue a grim story of what brought him to India in a single extended take. For a few minutes a glossy showcase of a picture becomes about more urgent and painful matters. The film is a fairly faithful transcription of events even though Liz as played by Roberts carries a faint air of entitlement. Im not sure this could be avoided on screen. What glides by on the page can provoke unwanted scrutiny when visualized. Liz learns to assess herself outside her usual New York life and materialism. How? By putting together an exotic travel package of unspecified cost and unlimited personal payoff. Thats nice for her. I do wish however that Murphy had found a way inside the woman at the center of things. MPAA rating PG-13 (for brief strong language some sexual references and male rear nudity) Cast Julia Roberts (Liz Gilbert); James Franco (David); Billy Crudup (Stephen); Viola Davis (Delia); Richard Jenkins (Richard from Texas); Javier Bardem (Felipe) Credits Directed by Ryan Murphy; written by Ryan Murphy and Jennifer Salt based on the book by Elizabeth Gilbert; produced by Dede Gardner.

Absolutely nothing thats what as millions of readers of Elizabeth Gilberts phenomenally successful 2006 memoir Eat Pray Love will attest. The high-concept structure of Gilberts confessional story is surely a draw After a painful divorce the author ships off on a yearlong international odyssey to pick up the pieces of her shattered self touching down in Italy to eat India to pray and Bali to fall in love. (The love part was not on the authors agenda until the irresistible Brazilian man she calls Felipe in the book whom she has since married changed her Indonesian plans.) But whats even more seductive than the exoticism of Gilberts passport stamps is her ability to describe her moment-to-moment meal-to-meal feelings with such warm chatty deprecating self-awareness that even her episodes of dithering obsessing or Wheres the rest of me? boo-hooing sound kind of...endearing. On the page Liz Gilbert comes across as a cool friend a smart sister a snappy pal who seems to promise ""If I can get myself together so can you."" And you want to believe her. Or at least you want to chew what shes chewing. Eat Pray Love the movie directed by Glee co-creator Ryan Murphy cant muster the sound of Elizabeth Gilbert being Liz. It just cant no matter how dutifully Murphy and co-screenwriter Jennifer Salt stitch phrases from the page into the screenplay because the very nature of movies -- images come to life words spoken out loud -- is antithetical to Gilberts distinctive literary style with words passed privately silently between the writer and her reader. On the other hand Eat Pray Love the movie has Julia Roberts as Liz Gilbert Which is a nice choice. If anyone can make chowing down on a plate full of spaghetti look like a joyful sensual prelude to enlightenment its Roberts who offers herself as Our Julia as generously as Gilbert connects with readers as Our Liz. Roberts relaxed gracefulness whether shes spooning gelato folding her long legs in meditation or bicycling through the Balinese countryside to study at the feet of a revered medicine man is the movies greatest asset. Also she wears a really pretty dress-like-the-locals wardrobe. Maybe she can travel light because she restocks her suitcase each time her plane lands. If only Roberts warmth coupled with Javier Bardems scruffy sexiness as Felipe were enough to compensate for the folded-map flatness of this production. If only this glossy Eat Pray Love -- an armchair journey for these staycation times -- didnt amount to a whole lot of navel-gazing about problems that absent the authors unique narrative language dont nearly fill up the 133-minute space the movie version allots. A prelude establishes the disintegration of Lizs marriage (to a warring spouse played by Billy Crudup) which falls apart for reasons never satisfactorily explained (in the book the author didnt even try -- the mess just was). Then its on to Lizs less-than-convincing pre-divorce romance (with James Franco as a -- what else? -- cute young actor) which disintegrates under similar circumstances of who-knows-what. And then All aboard the movie chugs from country to country port of enlightenment to port of enlightenment with a kind of dogged tour-group energy. Touchdown in each locale is announced via touristic world-music selections; we know for example that Liz is about to meet Felipe when the samba music cues up. The director also favors ambiance shots of gesticulating Italians scrambling street-urchin Indian kids and gentle farming Indonesians. And he falls for a tacky chick-flick sequence (or maybe its a fat-free-yogurt commercial) in which Liz and a new European girlfriend bound by a vow to forget calorie counts and love carbs try to zip up new jeans. Under the circumstances Roberts scenes with Six Feet Unders (yet again) great Richard Jenkins as a fellow meditation student at her Indian ashram are almost jarring in the passionate naturalism Jenkins brings to the role -- a passion that brings out Roberts best work here. Where Felipe and the rest of the folks Liz meets are types -- the handsome Italian teacher the unhappily betrothed Indian girl the toothless Indonesian guru -- Jenkins turns Richard From Texas into a specific soul in search of redemption. Even spouting guru-type aphorisms such as ""You want to get to the castle youve got to swim the moat"" (huh?) hes a man worth circling the globe to spend time with. The rest of the passengers? After you land you wont keep in touch.

She wasnt terribly likable but she was oddly compelling. Eat Pray Love Bad to fair Director Ryan Murphy. Cast Julia Roberts Javier Bardem Richard Jenkins Billy Crudup. Rating PG-13 for brief strong language some sexual references and male rear nudity. Javier Bardem on co-starring with Roberts Spotlight Julia Roberts | Travel movies Movies about food | Chick flicks Based on bestsellers Now that the book has become a movie with the perpetually endearing Julia Roberts playing the author the emphasis has shifted a bit. Now youve got a character that is a lot more likable but shes also a lot less interesting. Its not merely the leading ladys star quality that makes the character feel different. The screenplay by Jennifer Salt and director Ryan Murphy tidies up Gilbert. Unlike the book theres no big emotional breakdown; instead this is a postcard-pretty case of midlife soul-searching. In the film a dissatisfied Gilbert suddenly ends her marriage without warning shattering her husband (Billy Crudup). He is shocked but so is the audience She gives little notice and the whole thing comes out of left field. After a quickie romance with an actor (played by James Franco as if hes vaguely stoned) Gilbert decides to reassess her life. She plans a yearlong trip that encompasses Italy India and Bali; oh to be an angst-filled writer with a hefty bank account. In Italy Gilbert eats a lot makes friends and learns about letting yourself go. It all seems a bit trite and its not helped by the predictable stereotypes (all Italians speak with their hands) or the soundtrack blaring accordion music as if youre dining at the Olive Garden. The general dippiness isnt helped by the dialogue ""Every word in Italian is like a truffle"" Gilbert exclaims as she learns the language. Equally annoying is the gauzy lighting which gives Roberts a sweetly angelic glow most of the time. After such a dreary beginning things pick up when Gilbert goes to India. At an ashram she bonds with a fellow American (Richard Jenkins) and you actually start to buy into Gilbert as a character. The writing gets sharper and Jenkins and Roberts seem emotionally plugged into each other particularly during a scene in which he tells her about the end of his marriage. Its almost like someone else took over as director for the India scenes. Suddenly youre not watching a movie star traipse around the world; instead you start believing this is a woman in emotional distress. Unfortunately the movie descends into dewy rom-com territory for the final act. In Bali Gilbert meets a charming Brazilian named Felipe played by Javier Bardem as a macho softie who oozes sex appeal. Felipe may as well walk around in a T-shirt that says ""Worlds Most Perfect Man."" Theres not much doubt that theyll end up together because Gilbert would be crazy to let him slip away. Of course the movie climaxes with a will-she-find-him-in-time search that is utter Hollywood cliche. At least she doesnt run after him at an airport. Its moments like that when you really question what Murphy is doing with Gilberts book. When he gets it right - as in the sequences with Jenkins - he creates something genuinely affecting. When he gets it wrong all youve got is Roberts toothy smile to carry the load. The result is a very disconnected film that doesnt hang together as a whole. One of Murphys oddest choices is a scene in which Roberts cutely tries on outfits while the soundtrack blasts an oldie; shades of both ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Sleeping with the Enemy."" Its like some kind of Julia Roberts greatest-moments collection though one guesses that probably wouldnt include this film. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

TWITTER In ""Eat Pray Love"" Julia Roberts character Liz Gilbert takes a holiday from her miserable life as a well-respected financially secure New York writer loved by men she cannot love back and despairing of her own inner emptiness. She travels the world to seek enlightenment a journey -- she never hesitates to tell anyone she meets -- outside her own comfort zone. For the viewer though its anything but. The film never ventures even once into a situation that does not reek of comfy familiarity. Of course the Elizabeth Gilbert memoir on which the movie is based also got criticized for its Western fetishization of Eastern thought and the overly self-conscious nature of this journey -- reportedly paid for with a publishers advance for the book itself. None of that stopped her memoir from becoming a bestseller translated into 40 languages. So with Julia Roberts making one of her increasingly rare starring appearances and the sensual beauty of Italy India and Indonesia as backdrop for the romanticized navel-gazing ""Eat Pray Love"" should attract a substantial female audience a demographic ill-served by the summers mostly testosterone-fueled movies. Working from a screenplay he wrote with Jennifer Salt director Ryan Murphy the creator of TV series ""Nip/Tuck"" and ""Glee"" never loses track of the storys bestseller attributes foreign landscapes photographed at sunset or sunrise food displayed with mouth-watering intensity peripheral characters bursting with vitality all men unnaturally gorgeous -- or at least interesting -- and female self-discovery as the unwavering central focus. Reeling from a divorce and an affair that didnt do the trick either Liz tells her best friend and publisher (Viola Davis not given nearly enough to do) that she intends to chuck everything for a year to research herself in exotic foreign climes. Everyone including her ex (Billy Crudup) and new boy toy (James Franco) pull long faces but this gal makes a career out of thinking of nobody but herself. Several months are spent in Rome to enjoy food and life (Eat) then off to India for meditation in an ashram (Pray) and finally to Bali Indonesia to search for ""balance"" but finding herself off-balance instead with a Brazilian divorcee (Love). Each segment is thoroughly enjoyable in a touristic sort of way. And Roberts throws herself wholeheartedly into the role of the inner-truth seeker. There of course lies the problem. One can line a bookcase with memoirs novels and DVDs about urban malcontents discovering food and life in Mediterranean climes. At least another bookshelf could be devoted to popular entertainments where Westerners seek spirituality in the East dating back to Somerset Maughams ""The Razors Edge"" if not the earlier works of Hermann Hesse. Bali is a bit off the beaten path for such self-help entertainments but after those terrorist bombings the place could use positive publicity. In each segment Liz is given role models. In Rome a Scandinavian (Tuva Novotny) and local language coach (the absurdly handsome Luca Argentero) show Liz how to embrace life through cuisine. The girls even nip away to Naples for a pizza sequence Her Roman lesson Dont be afraid to attack life. In an unnamed Indian ashram Richard Jenkins plays a Texan who struggles to forgive himself for his alcoholic past. He mocks and kids Liz to cajole her to do likewise. Then a young girl (Rushita Singh) who dreads her arranged marriage reminds Liz of her own unarranged marriage and its failure. Her Indian lesson God dwells within me. In Bali two healers (Indonesian screen legend Christine Hakim and newcomer Hadi Subiyanto) provide Liz with medicine for her ailing soul. Her Bali lesson If youre a good girl you may get Javier Bardem. As Liz literally sails off into a sunset you imagine that last lesson will be the one that sticks. There is an undeniable attractiveness to all this however doubtful the self-realization lessons may be. One can imagine whiling away pleasant hours watching this movie again as a late-night DVD or in-flight movie. The charms of each location and the vigor of the films supporting players cast a romantic glow. No travel -- and certainly self-realization -- is never quite like this with Robert Richardsons iridescent landscapes and loving portraits of colorful bystanders the brilliant exotic sets and costumes by Bill Groom and Michael Dennison and nicely unhurried pace of Bradley Bueckers editing. But it should be.

The food looks great but the romance is undercooked and God remains strictly a bit player in ""Eat Pray Love."" While far from an unpleasant experience as it whisks Julia Roberts through Italy India and Indonesia (tourist boards rejoice) director Ryan Murphys superficial take on Elizabeth Gilberts phenomenally successful memoir is an exotic junk-food buffet that offers few lasting pleasures or surprises let alone epiphanies. Sony release should do well with a sizable and underserved audience of older femmes though Gilberts more discriminating readers may find themselves reaching for pillows and Pepto-Bismol by the end of this overlong voyage. A successful New York writer racked with guilt and depression after a painful divorce Gilbert sought recovery by spending a year abroad in pursuit of culinary pleasure spiritual enlightenment and though she could hardly have predicted it at the time romantic fulfillment. Published in 2006 her account of her journey was greeted with an Oprahs Book Club endorsement and a lengthy stint on the New York Times bestseller list; the backlash from some quarters was equally rabid as readers derided Gilberts foodie excess her New Age navel-gazing and most unfairly the economic privilege (her travels were financed by an advance book deal) that made her therapeutic odyssey possible. But whatever its flaws and indulgences Gilberts book is a work of honest introspection graced with a felicitous prose style many cuts above the chick-lit norm -- qualities conspicuously absent from the film despite its best efforts to reproduce her warm witty voice in streams of narration. Adapting an episodic self-help tome is no easy task and as scripted by Murphy and Jennifer Salt ""Eat Pray Love"" is a bloated nearly 2 1/2-hour film with a dearth of dramatic incident. Result reps an awkward compromise between the authors personal vignettes and the commercial imperatives of a bigscreen romance anchored by a heroine whose resemblance to Gilbert is crushed by Roberts larger-than-life personality. After being brought to her knees one night in tearful desperate prayer thirtysomething Liz (Roberts) decides its time to break things off with Stephen (Billy Crudup) her pleasant but rudderless husband of eight years. The divorce proceedings are bitterly dragged out and not even a passionate rebound fling with a hunky younger actor (James Franco) can dispel Lizs toxic cloud of misery. Realizing her constant sniveling isnt getting her anywhere (or endearing her to viewers) Liz resolves to start over and appropriately enough for a journey of self-discovery spend four months in each of those three ""I"" countries. Her whirlwind tour begins in Rome where she learns Italian and binges on gelato and pasta (her first bite of spaghetti is so heavenly its set to an aria from Mozarts ""Magic Flute""); then to a Hindu ashram in India where she cultivates the disciplines of meditation and silence; and finally to the Indonesian island of Bali where she allows herself to be courted by swarthy Brazilian divorcee Felipe (Javier Bardem). Everyone she meets along the way turns out to be a veritable fount of folksy wisdom whether its Balinese medicine man Ketut (Hadi Subiyanto delightful) or a tough-love type Liz befriends at the ashram the drolly named Richard From Texas (Richard Jenkins bringing flashes of gruff wit to a comic-relief role). Murphy currently earning accolades as showrunner on TV smash ""Glee"" has again tackled a popular memoir (after 2006s ""Running With Scissors"") with indifferent results. Largely dumping Gilberts eloquent freewheeling ruminations on the nature of God Murphy simply cherry-picks the warmest fuzziest moments from his source material then flattens them with sentimental beats easy laughs and a few outright falsifications (in the films rejiggered history of events Liz and Felipe actually meet cute after a car accident). Even with the usual allowances for creative latitude theres something unusually phony about such fudging in a movie thats ostensibly about the quest for inner truth. Though Roberts is nearly a decade older than Gilbert was at the time (Bardem by contrast is a decade too young for the 52-year-old Felipe) the actress can still hold a closeup effortlessly and she looks terrific in a succession of Third World-chic outfits designed by Michael Dennison. But aside from a few shots of her sitting with her legs crossed ""Eat Pray Love"" shows little interest in Lizs inner life or Roberts ability to explore it. Instead Murphy seems to have directed the thesp to behave like a typically shrill snappish self-analyzing romantic-comedy heroine prone to throwing back her head and letting loose that inimitable Roberts cackle; when Ketut orders Liz to smile during meditation you want to tell him not to encourage her. Like most cinematic travelogues the film boasts no shortage of pleasing sights and sounds with scenic locations nicely decked out by production designer Bill Groom and lensed by d.p. Robert Richardson; editor Bradley Buecker gives the Italian food montages a deft teasing flair. Dario Marianellis score provides melodious connective tissue for a soundtrack swollen with opera Neil Young and various locale-appropriate tunes.
