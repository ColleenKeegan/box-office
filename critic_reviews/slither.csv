Comments Slither Recommended A meteor lands in the sticks and a slimy tentacled creature enters a locals body (Michael Rooker) turning him into a squishy monster with a hunger for meat that drives him to devour most of the people and animals around him. Gross-out horror comedy is my least favorite genre but this movies so skillful I have to take my hat off to it. Writer-director James Gunn who worked on the script of the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead relies too much on George A. Romeros imagery without trying for any of his or Joe Dantes satire. But hes so adept at laughs thrills and repulsive effects that even the product placements are inspired and he gets the most out of Nathan Fillion Elizabeth Banks and Gregg Henry. R 95 min.

From the scatter-shot mind of James Gunn writer of the Dawn of the Dead remake comes a monstrously funny alien-invasion-zombie-horror-comedy. Tongue firmly in cheek Gunn affectionately harks back to 50s sci-fi 80s schlock horror and the corporeal disgust of Cronenbergs Shivers as a South Carolina hick town descends into anarchy when an alien creatures flesh-burrowing spike transforms  businessman Michael Rooker into a slimy tentacular squid-beast with a craving for raw meat. Then pink phallic slugs explode from the distended stomach of another victim and wriggle into peoples mouths turning them into flesh-craving zombies. Rookers trophy wife laconic cop Nathan Fillion the towns foul-mouthed mayor and sparky teenager Tania Saulner fight a spirited rearguard action. You may be tempted to read the victims insatiable hunger as a comment on Americas epidemic obesity; or you may be too busy laughing or vomiting to bother with such thematic niceties.

"Slither reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Slither reviewed. Slither reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 30 2006 618 PM Slugfest Slither a delightfully flimsy horror film. By Josh Levin Michael Rooker and Brenda James in Slither Not long ago the only way to make a profitable horror flick was by throwing together some ironically distant teenagers. In the decade since the Scream franchise proved once and for all that scary movies are easy money pretty much every micro-genre has been revived and strip mined. The filmgoing public has been assaulted by zombies out-of-retirement slashers grindhouse-style Slovakian psychos and phone calls that are coming from inside the house Until Slither (Universal) though nobody had bothered to re-animate the particular type of schlocky fare thats the stock in trade of Troma Entertainment the micro-budget studio known for gross-out effects and amateur-hour production values. Before he wrote and directed Slither James Gunn authored 1996s Tromeo and Juliet a farce that merges the Bards words with Troma calling cards like lesbianism and decapitation. Still how can I be so confident that Gunn learned all he needs to know about filmmaking from the trashy studio that brought us The Toxic Avenger? He did co-write a book called All I Need to Know About Filmmaking I Learned From the Toxic Avenger. But beyond that his latest film bears the hallmarks of a Troma venture a passel of disfigured and dismembered bodies and perhaps by necessity a refusal to take itself seriously. Advertisement Slither opens when an alien egg that looks like a moldy casaba melon falls from the sky and nestles into the South Carolina woods. An unlucky soul named Grant (Michael Rooker) happens upon the downed melon pokes at it with a stick and looses a flesh-eating intergalactic slug that jumps inside his chest and short-circuits his brain. Grants main symptoms are some unsightly blemishes and a hankering for meat an urge he satisfies by snacking on the neighborhood pets. When his wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks) discovers that their basements been converted into a slaughterhouse she suspects that her husbands in a bad way. And then comes the slug army which spews forth from the most horribly distended belly since Monty Pythons The Meaning of Life.  The little buggers start crawling into peoples mouths eventually turning them into zombies mind-melded to the boss slug thats controlling Grant who by this point--follow me here--has grown tentacles and started drooling. (The townspeople suspect he has leprosy or Lyme disease or might have turned into a giant squid. I thought he looked more like a mucus-covered Noid.) The plot stops for some awkward exposition in which its explained that the slugs are a ""conscious disease."" The plain-spoken Sheriff Pardy (Nathan Fillion channeling both Evil DeadsBruce Campbell and his own gruff space captain from Serenity) prefers not to over-analyze things ""That is some fucked-up shit."" The sheriffs got the right idea This is not a thinking mans horror movie. I wouldnt be surprised if there were slugs that could find gaping holes in the plot. But theres something winning about this grab bag of orally fixated invertebrates and mucus-covered Noids. Compared with a high-gloss by-the-numbers killfest like Final Destination (2000) Slither looks like the handiwork of a daydreaming middle-schooler goofing off in his backyard. Sure when the sheriff wrestles an infected deer it looks more like some badly singed beef teriyaki. But at least the diseased livestock doesnt look like someone double-clicked it over from OS X. Slither is a drive-in movie for the multiplex age. Josh Levin is Slates executive editor. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Outer-space slugs By Jeff Shannon      Special to The Seattle Times PREV of NEXT CHRIS HELCERMANAS-BENGE          Gregg Henry needs a beer ... to dump on sluglike aliens. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Slither"" with Nathan Fillion Elizabeth Banks Michael Rooker Gregg Henry. Written and directed by James Gunn. 96 minutes. Rated R for strong horror violence and gore and language. Several theaters. Good news fright fans ""Slither"" is the best horror comedy since ""Shaun of the Dead"" -- but that wont comfort the folks of Wheelsy S.C. In writer-director James Gunns gonzo valentine to the gross-out horror films of the 70s and 80s Wheelsy is under siege by slugs from outer space. Before long theyve mutated the local yokels into redneck zombies controlled by slimy parasites with a hearty appetite for red meat. Preferably rib-eye steak but human flesh will do in a pinch. Local businessman Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) is victim No. 1 destined to become the parasitical host with the most (tentacles that is). While Wheelsys mayor (comedic scene-stealer Gregg Henry) floats dimwit theories about the growing infestation (""maybe its Lyme disease"") newly promoted police chief Pardy (Nathan Fillion star of ""Serenity"") joins Grants wife (Elizabeth Banks) in an effort to stop the invasion before Wheelsy turns into Slugville. If youre not hooked move along and let us horror fans have some fun. As a former colleague of Z-movie king Lloyd Kaufman of Troma Films infamy Gunn wrote trash classics like ""Tromeo amp; Juliet"" before penning 2004s ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake. Hes got a gift for combining throwaway gags with the kind of gloppy gore that reached its pinnacle in John Carpenters 1982 remake of ""The Thing."" With additional nods to directors like David Cronenberg (a local shop is named after ""Videodrome"" antihero Max Renn) and Frank Henenlotter (""Basket Case"") ""Slither"" is a movie only true horror buffs can love. Its greatest strength is that it never aspires to be anything more than it is 96 minutes of good laughs and retro-splatter.

Film Title Slither. Photo Chris Helcermanas- There is life out there and its mighty gross 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Slither Horror. Starring Nathan Fillion Elizabeth Banks Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker. Directed by James Gunn. Running time 106 minutes (Rated R. At Bay Area theaters.) A movie character knows the worlds gone to hell when he survives a zombie offensive only to be attacked by a carnivorous deer. Of course if the character is in ""Slither"" hes already faced a giant squid thing thousands of brain-stealing slugs and an exploding human balloon. A bloodthirsty deer just adds insult to injury. In a variety of forms ""Slither"" excels in imaginative gore and shows that first-time director James Gunn -- who penned the screenplay for ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) -- has learned much about the joys of linking humor and horror. In this case he pastiches both the zombie and alien-invasion genres while preserving the endearing inanity of both resulting in a B-movie whose laughs are as intentional as its explosive gross-out effects. The premise is as subtle as an aneurism. A meteor lands outside a folksy burg in North Carolina disgorging an alien blob that quickly possesses an upstanding citizen named Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) husband to the lovely Starla (Elizabeth Banks). Things start going bad in the town of Wheelsy faster than you can say ""killer brain worms."" Maybe its those festering carcasses mysteriously stockpiled in an isolated barn; maybe it has something to do with folks and their pets going missing. It could be its the oversize slugs crawling down Main Street or Grant Grants sudden craving for raw hamburger. Say was that a human squid out there in the cow field? Enter our hero the slow-talkin tight trouser-wearin Sheriff Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) who sets to saving the planet and keeping the lovely Starla from her husbands mutant clutches. Fillion delivers his lines with a deadpan conviction that does his Malcolm Reynolds role in ""Serenity"" proud while Banks Starla steals the film with her treatise on marital fealty delivered to a husband-turned-killer squid. Theres a special delight in watching a town where nothing ever happens suddenly playing host to a hootenanny from hell. Gunn aims for broad targets and hits them every time whether lampooning the Wheelsy yokels and their deer-hunting ways or suggesting the family that slays together stays together when a teenagers zombie kin urges her to join in ""family fun day."" The whole film balances excess with understatement as when the Sheriff attempts a post-bloodbath pep talk (""So how we all doing tonight?""). Gunn plumbs such horror cliches for laughs without mocking them. Along the way he gives visual shout-outs to genre conventions from ubiquitous monsters-eye-view camera angles to a brief television clip from the cult favorite ""The Toxic Avenger."" Gunn knows his roots and mines them for every slimy groan theyve got. The results are as campy as theyre supposed to be because ""Slither"" is a labor of love made by a horror aficionado who knows just when to tweak the tropes. -- Advisory Contains violence sexual situations foul language and cannibalism.

PARKS Copyright 2006 Houston Chronicle Published 530 am Friday March 31 2006 Before bursting into a barn to face a grotesque killer alien a small-town sheriff and his deputy play rock-paper-scissors to see who goes in first. One. Two. Three. The deputy does rock but seeing the sheriff has paper he quickly sticks out two fingers to make scissors. Sheriff goes first. Inside the barn the sheriff finds not the alien but a local woman whose face is now attached to a pink body swelled to the size of a humpback whale. When she bursts we learn she was impregnated by the alien and is full of about a trillion slimy slithering red slugs that want to crawl into your mouth and turn you into a flesh-craving (is there another kind?) zombie. Slither is seriocomic horror alternating laughs with gooey creepy scares. Director-screenwriter James Gunn (writer of Dawn of the Dead and Scooby-Doo) has combined a 1950s sci-fi plot with gross-out gore to make an effective -- if familiar -- horror film. Slither calls to mind Tremors Twin Peaks and Lake Placid as much as Night of the Living Dead. An asteroid crashes to Earth in the woods near the town of Wheelsy. A fragment hatches open to reveal a squishy blob that shoots -- Alien-like -- a needle into the chest of a local man named Grant. Within days Grant is buying all the raw meat in town and getting grotesque bumps and rashes all over. ""Its from a bee sting"" Grant tells his wife. She snaps to the truth when she finds missing pets and varmints rotting in their basement. (Slither is not afraid to break the movie taboo against dogicide. It also has a zombie deer.) Placing the film in Bumpkinville U.S.A. lets Gunn have fun with small-town and horror-movie cliches. Most of the inhabitants are hicks focused on Wheelsys Family Fun Day (sorry kids not this year) and on the annual Deer Cheer festivities when they can start blasting away at the Bambi population. The cast helps Gunns offbeat mostly verbal humor work especially Nathan Fillion (Serenity) as Sheriff Bill. Someone tells Bill ""Be careful"" as hes about to run into a house full of zombies. Fillion deadpans ""Yeah theres a thought"" into a laugh. Familiar heavy Michael Rooker is Grant the man who turns into the tentacled glop-faced creature. Even as an alien space entity he retains romantic feelings for his wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks of Seabiscuit). His attempts to love her up despite his grossness is a running scare-joke. Gregg Henry another regular villain is the towns obscenity-spewing mayor who still wants his Mr. Pibb zombies or no zombies. Obscenity and gore -- theres plenty of both -- account for the films rating. When a deputy tries to reason with Grant the half-man half-creature flashes a tentacle at him. A second later the deputy not yet realizing he has been slit in two from head to heels slowly peels open exposing wet red innards and falls to the ground. Theres also a scene uncomfortably like rape in which the alien tentacles from inside Grants chest thrust into a womans chest and impregnate her with slug babies. Leave the kids at home. Slither is never terrifying but it is scary in an ""oh yuck that nasty thing is going to touch her"" way. Every squeamish moment is overlaid with a funny one every joke with another gross-out shot. Its amusing if youre into that sort of thing. louis.parkschron.com Todays Deals Cap Barbell Cast-Iron Weights at Walmart from 2 + pickup Marc New York Womens Lace Sheath Dress for 26 + 8 samp;h American Airlines Nationwide Fares from 38 1-way Nikon Nikkor Lens Bundles at Adorama Up to 300 off + free...

Chris Helcermanas-Benge Universal Enlarge photo>> Summary SLITHER --  -- Nathan Fillion Elizabeth Banks Michael Rooker; R (violence gore profanity). SLITHER --  -- Nathan Fillion Elizabeth Banks Michael Rooker; R (violence gore profanity). In a world of brain-dead horror remakes writer-director James Gunn didnt just set out to redo any old fright flick. In the body-snatchers-from-space tale ""Slither"" he aimed to remake them all -- and more. With the gore-minded glee of a fan attuned to every cinematic scare tactic Gunn also knows how silly they are infusing ""Slither"" with a wicked sense of parody while still crafting a clever maniacally paced twist on B-movie slimefests. The first-time director who wrote the screenplay for the 2004 remake ""Dawn of the Dead"" also has assembled a far finer cast than the genre typically presents led by Nathan Fillion of the cult TV series ""Firefly"" and its big-screen spin-off ""Serenity."" As Bill Pardy the police chief in a hillbilly town overrun by killer slugs and flesh-munching zombies Fillion expands on the droll flair he mastered as skipper of the rickety spaceship Serenity. ""Slither"" also lets Fillion cut loose and get really goofy all the while maintaining his boyish rogues charm. This guy deserves to be a major star. Gunn nicely establishes the story in a quick opening segment as a meteor hurtles toward Earth. Cut to the Southern burgh of Wheelsy where a bored Pardy and a deputy fritter away time in a patrol car by checking the speed of a whippoorwill with their radar gun. Theyre so benumbed by the snails pace of their town that they never notice the fiery flash behind them as the meteor crashes in the woods. Things quickly speed up though as lunk-headed businessman Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) stumbles on the meteorite and the giant oozy slug that crawls out of it. Grant becomes host for a parasite that prompts him to hilariously -- and gruesomely -- stockpile raw meat and the carcasses of neighborhood pets in his basement. Hes also gradually transformed into a freakish tentacled predator whose activities unleash hordes of slimy worms that turn the townsfolk into meat-hungry zombies. Pardy and Grants wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks) with whom the police chief shares an unrequited romantic history race through a rip-roaring night of the living dead as they try to put down Grant and his zombie army. The grisly creature effects and themes of parasitic possession pay respect to ""The Thing"" ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" the ""Alien"" franchise the George Romero zombie flicks and countless other creature features. Gunn revels in the absurdities of horror conventions but also clearly loves them. Hes a real student of the stuff piling on moments that embrace and spoof not only fright films but other movies. When the alien infestation threatens to undermine Wheelsys annual deer-hunting festival the mayor (Gregg Henry in an outrageously over-the-top comic performance) callously hopes to salvage the event a la the mayor in ""Jaws"" who hoped to save his islands tourist season despite the killer shark. A close encounter with one of the alien parasites gives spunky teenager Kylie (Tania Saulnier) extraterrestrial insight allowing her to explicate the creatures nature and purpose the way Bill Pullman did in ""Independence Day."" And a scene where zombies do ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" coming after Starla uttering her name instead of Marlon Brandos ""Stella"" is just priceless. Hollywood has hit on a dependable little gold mine churning out shoddy horror remakes and other bad scary movies. Heres hoping someone like Gunn who has a truly creative vision for the genre can find the same commercial success. ""Slither"" is rated R for strong horror violence gore and language. Running time 96 minutes. Recommended Stories Brie Larson confirmed as Captain Marvel Oscar winner Brie Larson has a new title to add to her resume Superhero.

"So slimy so silly and so good - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW So slimy so silly and so good By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  March 31 2006 At last the mutant alien redneck zombie movie the world has been waiting for. Slither"" is cheap disgusting and ridiculous; its also smart very funny and knowingly in touch with its B-movie roots. The faint of heart should skip it but if your guilty-pleasure tastes run to such storied horror-comedies as Re-Animator"" and Tremors"" heres your cup of extraterrestrial gastropod guts.Before a meteor lands on the edge of town not much happens in Wheelsy besides deer season and inbreeding. Mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry) is a blow-dried pottymouth while police chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion of Serenity"") pines for his childhood sweetheart schoolteacher Starla (Elizabeth Banks). Unfortunately shes married to Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) the macho blowhard whos Wheelsys leading citizen.Even more unfortunately Grant gets too close to a pulsing pile of slime in the woods and soon hes haunting the deli counter at the supermarket growling Meat."" Say what you will about the man he does love his wife even after he transforms into a giant tentacled slime monster. The mayors convinced its just Lyme disease; the police arent so sure and plot their quarrys whereabouts on a map with little squid icons.Every worthwhile horror movie since Alien"" has its carefully worked out evolutionary calculus and Slither"" is no different. One of Grants early victims becomes a giant human womb that releases millions of blood-red slugs that fan out across town leaping into peoples mouths and turning them into zombies controlled by the Grant/alien thingie. This means that whenever Starla encounters one of the undead he or she insists on working out the couples domestic issues. Can you do couples therapy with a hive mind?The slug-attack sequences are giddy and terrifying -- drive-in cheese at its creepiest -- and the bathtub scene lives up to its billing on the films poster. Slither"" does for taking a good long soak what Jaws"" did for swimming in the ocean.As rousing as it is the gores for the diehards. What makes a good horror-comedy work -- as opposed to all the teen dice-and-slice product"" that clogs up multiplexes -- is sharp performances sharper timing and a willingness to admit to the genres fundamental silliness.Slither"" has all three. The acting is playful aces all around Fillion gives good exhausted incredulity Banks gives good virginal idiocy and Rooker gives great conflicted monster arrogance even before the aliens get him. The film moves forward with the relentlessness of a low-budget nightmare pausing every so often to point giggle shriek and run away.Writer-director James Gunn has been around the block and Slither"" is a winking resume of his influences. The towns beer joint is named Henenlotters in honor of the director of the grindhouse classic Basket Case"" (1982) while David Cronenbergs 1975 They Came From Within"" gets a viscous shout-out. Gunn earned his stripes writing scripts for the Z-movie studio Troma which accounts for the companys president Lloyd Kaufman showing up in a cameo as a wino. He also wrote the recent Dawn of the Dead"" remake which explains this movies deep knowledge of zombie behavioral habits (i.e. they never run but can only totter).Still its Gunns love of the absurd that keeps Slither"" sailing along its bloody track. After a series of developments that raise the ick factor to jaw-dropping levels the movie scores the climactic showdown between Starla and what used to be her husband to the couples favorite song. Who knew that when Air Supply recorded its gloriously sappy 1980 hit Every Woman in the World"" it would find its true meaning as the expression of the love between a woman and her slug.

An alien invades Michael Rookers body turning him into a zombie. At left is Brenda James. Universal Studios It doesnt aspire to be anything complex high-tech or terribly clever but it succeeds at gleefully grossing us out with its vision of hundreds of invading pulsating slugs and an ever-swelling giant mutant mollusk that begins to resemble Jabba the Hutt the more he grows. It celebrates the goofy creepiness of cheesy horror films while offering audiences plenty of tension-reducing laughs in the process. A meteorite crashes to Earth unseen by the police inside a squad car stationed nearby. Its a slow crime day in the small town of Wheelsy where the big event of the year is the jamboree for the start of deer-hunting season. (Theres a funny recurring gag about Lyme disease in light of the woodsy environs and the infestation of extraterrestrial creepy crawlers.) About the movieSlither   1/2 (out of four)Director James Gunn Stars Nathan Fillion Elizabeth Banks Gregg Henry Distributor Universal Pictures Rating R for strong horror violence and gore and language Running time 1 hour 36 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The meteorite houses a peculiarly disgusting alien life form and not long after the rock hits the ground the tentacled creature infests the blustery person of Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) the towns classless rich guy who married the town beauty Starla (Elizabeth Banks). There is a hilarious bit featuring the couples song -- and one of the most annoying tunes ever recorded -- Air Supplys Every Woman in the World. Before tying the knot with Grant Starla wanted to run away to Hollywood with her buddy police chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion). Fillions well-timed quips and deadpan asides are a highlight. Once the slithery creature from outer space burrows into Grants body its only a matter of time before most of the town is infected turning into ravenous undead. That happens around the same time the undulating slugs worm their way into every conceivable nook and cranny. The police try to combat the heinous creatures to little effect. A team of bumbling officers faces off against the plague of slugs and the voracious flesh-eating zombies. Guess who wins? The contest is more fun than you might expect. For those who enjoy entertaining gross-out horror flicks Slither satisfies. The squeamish should probably keep their distance.

"Slither | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; slither ) Slither (Canada/United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Lets get this straight from the start Slither isnt great art but that doesnt mean it isnt good entertainment. One of a growing number of horror/comedy casseroles the film provides its share of tasty mouthfuls - at least up to a point. Putting it into context its not as enjoyable as either Tremors (which resides on the pinnacle) or Shaun of the Dead and is about on par with Eight Legged Freaks. Those in search of scares might do better to look elsewhere. Slither is too cheesy to be frightening. But the movie offers plenty of laughs indicating that the production team is aware that a serious version of this story might be enough to resurrect Mystery Science Theater 3000. The tactic works - make fun of things within the context of the movie so people in the audience are laughing with the film rather than at it. Slither takes us to the great state of Texas where something wicked this way comes. When Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) leaves on a late-night walk hes his usual grumpy self. But when he arrives home after having been injected by a wormy sort of thing out in the woods hes acting odd. At first his wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks) thinks hes being sentimental but then he develops hives and other signs that somethings not right. And there are behavioral issues to go along with the physical deformities. Does he have Lime Disease? A bad case of poison ivy? Or has he become the host for an alien life form? Considering the title my bet is on the latter. Once Grant goes on a rampage that involves more than one instance of turning Fido into Alpo the police become involved. Chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fallion) who has long held a torch for Starla must now hunt down whats left of her husband who resembles a cross between a squid and a giant ear of corn with bad skin and pointy teeth. But Grant has a few tricks up his sleeve. One of those involves causing a young woman to do a passable imitation of Mr. Creosote (from Monty Pythons The Meaning of Life). When she pops out pore thousands of slippery slug-like CGI critters that undulate all over the place. As comedy horror movies go Slither is more than passable although it doesnt achieve the level of the funnier more clever Tremors which is the Holy Grail for mainstream films of this genre. With the possible exception of one well-orchestrated ""boo"" moment theres not a genuine scare to be found between the credits sequences bookending Slithers story. Theres plenty of blood and viscera but its of the kind that amuses with its over-the-top look. For the most part the computer generated special effects look fake and Im sure thats what writer/director James Gunn is shooting for. Slither starts out slowly; the first half-hour drags. Things pick up however and once Slither slides in its groove the movie crackles with campy energy. In addition to nailing the tone Gunn gives us a pair of surprisingly likeable protagonists. Bill and Starla arent well-rounded three-dimensional characters but we cant help rooting for them. Part of their appeal is no doubt due to the performances of Nathan Fillion and Elizabeth Banks (the wild woman in The 40-Year-Old Virgin). They are joined in their endeavors by a trash-talking politician (Gregg Henry) and a pretty young thing (Tania Saulnier) who encounters her first slug while taking a bath. Slither isnt for everyone. In fact its probably only for a select few - those who revel in this sort of Troma-inspired bloodsoaked offering and understand what its trying to do. Those who enjoy their horror straight up wont be impressed nor will those who prefer their comedy to come without a vomit bag. I believe Slither is exactly what Gunn wanted it to be and theres little doubt that his core audience will be thrilled. But its unlikely the films appeal will be as broad as it is deep.

And if he cant get a rise out of an audience weaned on John Carpenter movies hell just throw more putrefying effects on the screen. So sue me sometimes after a day of enjoying Belgian film-festival prizewinners I like to relax with copious servings of horror-flick slime and a good visual joke involving squids girls in bathtubs and overhead cameras. Here Gunn lovingly hacks up the whole horror-comedy genre with the giddily disgusting tale of Wheelsy a Southern town infested by alien slugs. The mother sucker from outer space enters the neighborhood through the host body of a local lout superfluously named Grant Grant (Michael Rooker from Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer -- killer casting). Her babies in turn transform their human prey into zombies. The zombies go gaga in the streets. And pretty soon the only uninfected folks are chief of police Bill Pardy (Serenitys Nathan Fillion) the towns dumdum mayor (Paybacks Gregg Henry) an all-purpose neighbor teen (Tania Saulnier in the bathtub) and Grants pretty wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks from The 40 Year-Old Virgin hilarious as a classic Hitchcock blonde) for whom Pardy has long carried a torch. There are times (and plenty of them) when Slither slops over from smart affectionate homage into unmodulated frat goofiness as Gunn cannibalizes so many horror plots with such high spirits. Well what do you expect from a comedy that hollers ""Goo riddance""?

""Slither"" is a gleefully nasty and ingeniously twisted horror-comedy that pits a populace of heavily armed but mostly clueless rednecks against flesh-eating zombies slimy extraterrestrial slugs and an acid-spewing multitentacled mutant. Call it ""Night of the Living Dead"" meets ""Tremors."" Scripter James Gunn infuses the pic his debut feature as a director with the exuberance of a movie geek given carte blanche to play fast and loose with the cliches and conventions of his favorite films. Result is a rock-the-house crowd-pleaser for genre aficionados though its breakout potential appears iffy. Gunn -- a Troma Entertainment alumnus whose writing credits range from ""Scooby Doo"" to 2004s ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake -- deftly balances broad humor rude shocks and gross-out special effects for a fang-in-cheek extravaganza that often feels like a slightly more upscale version of cheapie-creepy Troma product. Wheelsy the kind of small town where the start of hunting season is celebrated as a local holiday is where Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) a wealthy but none-too-refined businessman somehow managed to claim Starla (Elizabeth Banks) a local beauty as his trophy wife. Trouble is Starla has grown tired of fulfilling her conjugal duties. Stung by Starlas latest rejection Grant seeks solace in a seedy bar where tarty Brenda (Brenda James) proves far more receptive to his sex appeal. Unfortunately when the couple decides to take a walk in the nearby woods they come across a recently landed meteorite. Something emerges from within -- and plunges into Grant. For the first half-hour or so ""Slither"" seems to be a seriocomic riff on sci-fi thrillers in which hapless humans are infected by extraterrestrial contamination or manmade maladies. As such the pic often echoes David Cronenbergs ""Rabid"" and John Carpenters remake of ""The Thing."" But by the time Grant evolves into a toothy slime-encrusted behemoth with a pronounced resemblance to a squid and Brenda expands to become a humongous breeder of malignant slugs its clear Gunn wont be content to reference only one kind of monster. Much to the great distress of dry-witted police chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) and blowhard mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry) the victims of the malignant slugs wont stay dead. Rather the dearly departed reawaken as staggering shambling zombies mentally connected to Grant an increasingly more powerful (and more disgusting) entity. ""Slither"" begins briskly gradually accelerates and eventually achieves a breakneck momentum that makes the wild ride even more exhilarating. Here and there though pic slows down for a clever bit of throwaway lunacy like the revelation that Wheelsy has a karaoke bar. The special effects are a nifty mix of old-school prosthetics and high-tech CGI making for a few genuinely shocking moments amid the farcical facade. Overall tech values are smartly dedicated to making ""Slither"" appear polished but not too polished so it can impress without straying too far from its B-movie roots. The well-cast actors -- including Tania Saulnier as a feisty teen whose family gets slugged -- go just far enough over the top to maintain the jokey/scary tone without becoming cartoonish. Fillion is particularly amusing while delivering wisecracks and ironic asides with the same sly spin he brought to cheeky dialogue in the cult fave ""Firefly"" TV series (and more recently its ""Serenity"" feature spinoff). For all his funny moments however Fillion also rises to the challenge of being relatively speaking the straight man or at least the pics voice of sanity. Henry gets big laughs with a much-bigger-than-life approach. And Rooker is surprisingly sympathetic even as his character turns into a special effect. Incidentally the film has absolutely nothing to do with Howard Zieffs 1973 pic of the same name starring James Caan and Sally Kellerman. Latter also was a comedy but had no slugs to speak of and nary a single zombie.
