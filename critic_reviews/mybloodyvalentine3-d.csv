Yes the ?Lionsgate logo looks absolutely amazing in 3-D. To be fair there is also an early bit of business involving an eyeball that you probably wont -- ahem -- see coming. And the fact that the psychos weapon of choice is a pickax does lend itself to the 3-D treatment. But what really leaps out at you about My Bloody Valentine 3-D is its lack of imagination.

My Bloody Valentine 3-D One eyeball too little | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMy Bloody Valentine 3-D One eyeball too littleWhile this American remake of a Canadian slasher flick is only perfunctory My Bloody Valentine 3-D at least fulfills the expectations raised by any horror movie that puts that number and letter at the end of its name. Before the first 10 minutes are over the audience has witnessed a wide array of lurid sights including an unfortunate encounter between a pickaxe and an eyeball.By Jason AndersonSPECIAL TO THE STARSun. Jan. 18 2009Starring Jaime King Jensen Ackles and Kerr Smith. Directed by Patrick Lussier. 101 minutes. At major theatres. 18AWhile this American remake of a Canadian slasher flick is only perfunctory My Bloody Valentine 3-D at least fulfills the expectations raised by any horror movie that puts that number and letter at the end of its name. Before the first 10 minutes are over the audience has witnessed a wide array of lurid sights including an unfortunate encounter between a pickaxe and an eyeball. In other words the preferred tactics of 3-D horror flicks havent changed much since the days of Friday the 13th 3-D in the 80s or even House of Wax in the 50s. However this one does benefit from technological improvements - My Bloody Valentine 3-D is the first horror film to use the same Real D system employed in Disneys recent toons and Beowulf.Unsurprisingly this production is slicker than the average scary movie what with its telegenic stars (including Supernaturals Jensen Ackles and former Dawsons Creek dweller Kerr Smith) and sure-handed direction by Patrick Lussier Wes Cravens long-time editor.Article Continued BelowFrom the 1981 original - no ones idea of a classic but still a milestone in the history of Canadian horror - the new version retains only a few trademark shocks and the concept of a pickaxe-wielding killer in a miners suit who terrorizes a town on Valentines Day. The massacre in the opening sequence is the work of Harry Warden a deranged miner who is seemingly killed in a collapse before he can be captured. Ten years later a new wave of murders suggests that Harry is back in business. One of the youngsters who barely survived an earlier encounter with the masked man Tom (Ackles) returns to town just before the nastiness begins again thereby raising the suspicions of Axel (Smith) a local cop who ended up marrying Toms old sweetie Sarah (Jaime King). Of course this love triangle is of strictly secondary importance. The movies primary objective is hurling whatever it can into the viewers face - the bloodier the object the better. The trouble with My Bloody Valentine 3-D is not the gruesome violence - this is a horror movie after all. In fact genre devotees will likely be impressed with the films old-school approach to mayhem rare in our mostly timid era of CG and PG-13 scares. No the trouble is that after that first gouged eyeball theres not a whole lot further to go. Novelty value being a rapidly diminishing thing the technology demands an escalation in intensity and inventiveness that the movie doesnt deliver. That My Bloody Valentine 3-D doesnt fall apart in the final reel again makes it unique among its genre brethren. But a flick like this needs competence less than it needs some real audacity.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Movie review My Bloody Valentine 3D -- 1 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review My Bloody Valentine 3D -- 1 out of 5 stars A scene from My Bloody Valentine 3D Lionsgate A scene from ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" A scene from ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" (Lionsgate) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic That cyclical cinematic fad known as 3D gets back to its gimmicky ""gotcha"" roots with My Bloody Valentine 3D a pick-axe-in-your-eyeball remake of a 1981 horror classic. No cartoon cuddliness in this 3D outing Its a hand-drips-blood-in-your-lap exploitation picture that will remind anyone who has seen the original 3D fad films of those flaming arrows and other stuff that leapt off the screen at folks sitting in the dark with silly glasses.The glasses are less silly but Bloody is a generally graceless outing lacking the subtlety or horror foreplay of the original. Editor-turned-director Patrick Lussier (White Noise 2) treats the multi-writer script as an afterthought and jumps straight into the mayhem as he recreates the mining disaster that gave us the miner-mass murderer Harry Warden ""10 years before."" A brisk opening shows us the mine owners son Tom (Jensen Ackles) whose blunder caused a cave-in; the single comatose miner rescued six days later; and the awful realization that his fellow victims didnt die of asphyxiation or the crush of earth. They were killed by a guy who didnt want them using up his oxygen a guy who awakes from his coma and wipes out the hospital for good measure then butchers teenagers who pay tribute to their fallen towns folk by going underground for some serious partying. Cut to 10 years later and the town of Harmony is trying to get through one Valentines Day without commemorating the massacre by the man in the oxygen mask.Kids who learned to get over their yen for subterranean sex by surviving a group grope in the tunnels back in the day are now the adults running Harmony. The jerk-jock Axel (Kerr Smith) has become sheriff. He has married the fetching Sarah (Jaime King) Toms ex and is cheating on her with Sarahs cashier at the family supermarket. (Megan played by Megan Boone reminds us that things other than pick axes leap off the screen in 3D films.) Tom returns to town to sell his daddys mine earning the ire of the locals (Kevin Tighe of the mining-labor strife classic Matewan among them). No sooner does Tom show up than the dead Harry Warden -- or an impersonator -- starts pick-axing people ripping their hearts out and sending them in heart-shaped boxes meant for Valentines Day candy.The plot staggers from absurd to ridiculous and the dialogue is strictly of the ""Look we dont have to go down there"" variety. But Lussier gives us a few good ""gotchas."" A chase through the supermarket is top-drawer tense and a few of the fights (most of the time people just run) have nerve.Lussiers chief contribution to the Bloody legacy is in the sex. The original wasnt exactly chaste with its opening image of a pick axe plunging through a topless teens heart-shaped breast tattoo.Here the money shot is provided by a very naked funny and plucky survivor of the original teens-in-mine massacre Irene. Character actress Betsy Rue gives her all and shows her all in a cheap hotel showdown that begins with unbridled sex. (She stares at the mirror on the ceiling mid-act and gloats ""God I look hot"") Then the guy with the mining gear shows up and spoils her R-rated fun. We dont have enough time with any character to wish them well in the face of certain death. We dont have more than a few minutes doubt who the killer is as likely ""copycats"" are pick-axed-off one by one.But if horror in general is the last great communal movie experience 3D just heightens the shared fun. If you thought people talked back to the screen when the butchery was 2D wait until somebody has a reason to duck. Wait until someone makes a good 3D horror film (more are on the way) and a Quarantine 3D a Hostel 3D or -- heres a million-dollar idea -- a Murder at the Multiplex 3D. You cant text and Twitter with RealDO glasses on and brain matter spattering all over your Redenbachers.

"3-D Bloody Valentine is an eye-popping affair - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW My Bloody Valentine 3D Bloody Valentine in 3-D is eye-popping ... literally By Ethan Gilsdorf Globe Correspondent / January 17 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Filmed in ""REAL D"" the new-ish spin on three-dimensional movie technology last seen in ""Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D"" ""My Bloody Valentine 3-D"" delivers an impressive illusion of depth and eye-popping realism.But 3-D fans with weak stomachs beware. Much of that pop comes from heads severed by shovels jets of blood and eyeballs skewered on pickaxes.The original ""My Bloody Valentine"" was released in 1981 back when horror franchises like ""Friday the 13th"" were just taking their baby steps. If you recall the genre involves partying sex-crazed teens who are stalked by a maniacal killer. The audience spends the movie wondering which of the local wing nuts lurks behind the mask.Fans nostalgic for the genre might appreciate this attempt at resurrection. Director Patrick Lussier who has helmed other hack-n-schlock sequels (""Dracula 2000"" ""The Prophecy 3 The Ascent"") begins his 3-D remake with a back story of drunk teens hacked to death in an abandoned coal mine. The killer? A freak wearing a jumpsuit and Darth Vader-like respirator. Flash-forward a decade Survivor Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles from ""Smallville"") now grown up returns to town to sell the mine he has inherited and to visit his old flame Sarah (Jaime King of this years ""The Spirit"") who is now married to the town sheriff (Kerr Smith).Of course his return coincides with Valentines Day. Naturally the decapitations and disembowelments begin anew. Is our haunted boy the pickax-wielding menace? Or someone else? ""My Bloody Valentine"" may not be horribly acted but in a post-""Scream"" and post-""Scary Movie"" era its difficult to squeeze any more blood from this low-brow/high-camp turnip. Lussier stages his movie not so much around nail-biting moments as novel ways to fling entrails at his viewers. But if you take pleasure in such mindless gore there must be worse ways to spend 100 minutes. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Although it boasts state-of-the-art 3-D camera trickery which helmer Patrick Lussier shamelessly exploits to goose the aud with cheap thrills and full-bore gore ""My Bloody Valentine"" is at heart an unabashedly retro work reveling in the cliches and conventions of the slasher horror pics that proliferated in the early 1980s. A remake of a 1981 low-budgeter of the same title that only diehard fans (and eager press-kit copywriters) would deem a ""classic"" this Lionsgate production should scare up more than enough coin in theatrical and homevid venues to justify the sequel so clearly signaled at final fade-out. The blood flows freely and frequently in Harmony a quaint little town with a grisly history. An opening-credits montage briskly details tragic events at the local mine where an accident in the tunnels leaves five men dead and one in a coma. But the real carnage doesnt begin until Harry Warden (Rich Walters) the sole survivor awakens -- on Valentines Day of course -- after a year-long slumber to cut a bloody swath through the community. Dressed in a miners work clothes and disguised with a gas mask Harry manages to kill 22 people with his pickaxe before hes repeatedly shot by local cops and presumed dead. Yeah right. Ten years later Tom (Jensen Ackles of TVs ""Supernatural"") a mining-company heir who inadvertently caused the long-ago accident returns to Harmony to sell the family business -- and maybe rekindle his romance with former sweetie Sarah (Jaime King) whos now inconveniently married to the local sheriff Axel (Kerr Smith). Even under the best of circumstances Axel wouldnt be overjoyed to see Tom back in town. But since Toms return coincides with the start of another killing spree by an axe-wielding dude in a gas-mask and miners coveralls Axel suspects the worst. Freely adapting the 1981 scenario by John Beaird (from a story by Stephen Miller) Todd Farmer and Zane Smith have cobbled together a serviceable script that is no more or less contrived and logic-defying than similar exploitation fare of a generation ago. To their credit theyre not slavishly faithful to 80s genre conventions -- the victims here are slightly older if no wiser than the unfortunate folks in what Roger Ebert memorably defined as ""dead teenager movies"" -- and some of their in-jokey tongue-in-cheek touches are genuinely funny. (They slyly tip their hat to another ""classic"" 80s shocker when a frightened character cries out ""Jason is that you?"") Director and co-editor Lussier (a frequent Wes Craven collaborator) plays the 3-D gimmick for all Its worth Everything from tree branches and gun barrels to bloody pickaxes and bloodier body parts appears to jump off the screen. He also makes effective use of the depth-of-field illusion allowing auds long views of various chest cavities from which hearts have been rudely ripped. At the very least the overall tech package is a great deal more impactful than that of the 3-D-lensed ""Friday the 13th Part III"" (1982). Thesping is generally solid with well-cast leads coming off as sincere rather than ironically aware. Casting of genre stalwart Tom Atkins (""The Fog"" ""Creepshow"") in a supporting role should amuse genre aficionados. Betsy Rue deserves some sort of Good Sport prize for remaining feisty and formidable during what may be the longest sustained sequence of gratuitous nudity in the history of slasher cinema. Surely such a revealing performance should not go unrecognized. My Bloody ValentineProductionA Lionsgate release of Lionsgate production. Produced by Jack Murray.

The idea behind movies like ""Chopping Mall"" or ""The House on Sorority Row"" was to entertain the audience with over-the top acts of violence. But in recent years that philosophy has been replaced by a desire to titillate moviegoers with acts of torture. Back when Freddy and Jason were prowling theaters the idea was to scare movie-going couples enough to make them wrap their arms around each other. Now they just want you to wrap your arms around a toilet. ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" returns to those entertainingly scary days of yesteryear. Theres no way to watch this non-stop string of brutal attacks without seeing the absurdity in the whole thing. Toss in first-rate 3D and the movie not only pays a proper homage to the 1981 original but kicks it up about 1000 notches. Fans of 70s and 80s horror films will recognize the familiar plot. An isolated community becomes the target of a killer. He chops his way through young and old while the local law enforcement show up just in time to crack bad jokes about the victims. The killer in ""Bloody Valentine"" is The Miner. He is a pick-swinging maniac made crazy after being the only survivor of a mining accident. It appeared The Miner was stopped after his first killing spree but 10 years later hes back to his old ways. The question is whether the original Miner has returned or someone new has decided to continue the tradition. Director Patrick Lurrier spent years working as an editor on such films as all three ""Scream"" offerings and ""Halloween H2O 20 Years Later."" The knowledge he gained from those movies comes through as he skillfully blends acts of violence with graveyard humor. Despite the brutality of the acts such a mix requires a delicate touch Swing too far toward the violence or the humor and the movie fails. Lurrier doesnt miss a step. Even a sequence with one of the longest gratuitous nude scenes in horror-movie history is played with a proper balance of tension and humor. As with the scary films of two decades ago the actors are really little more than props to get from one killing to the next. But Kerr Smith who plays the local sheriff is good enough to give the role some depth. His effort wasnt necessary but it is welcomed. This kind of horror flick has never been about great acting serious storytelling or even a plot. Such movies work if the violence makes you scream and laugh at the same time. ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" does that in spades. Actually it does it with a pick ax.
