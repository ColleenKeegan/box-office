The idea that garden ants not only talk but also make magic potions that shrink humans is the first concept that might trouble older humans in the audience the tone isnt fantastical enough. The pro-war message may not endear it to everyone either. Threatened by humans the ants retaliate with their potion leaving one attacker permanently shrunk. And as flying insects swoop to attack the ants like war planes they use all means necessary to fight back. Sure its a story of community and survival but its a dog-eat-dog one that lacks the cheery vibe of many family animations. Kiddie-friendly toilet humour a whiff of suspense and familiar voice actors make it passably entertaining but theres little warmth or emotional satisfaction to be had from its cynical characters.

Pictures Ants show shrunken bully whos the boss 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Ant Bully Animated feature. Voiced by Julia Roberts Nicolas Cage Meryl Streep and Paul Giamatti. Directed by John A. Davis. (PG. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In case you havent noticed childrens movies are no longer identified as such. Theyre labeled family entertainment and millions are spent on promoting the notion that kiddie fare -- whoops I mean family fare -- contains something for all age groups. With the beguiling animated feature ""The Ant Bully"" the claim is not hogwash. An ad could be written boasting This movie is for everyone who has ever become hypnotized watching ants forage for food and -- momentarily forgetting that their food source happens to be your kitchen -- pondered the thought processes of these industrious creatures. The brilliance of ""The Ant Bully"" is in the crafty way it delves into the minds of ants as they plot to save themselves from extermination. Filmmaker John A. Davis creates a marvelously labyrinthine society for them existing right below the surface of a bland suburb in Anywhere USA. Its a fantasy based on some knowledge of myrmecology. Ants really are as theyre presented the most social of species putting the good of the colony ahead of individual needs. The poetic license taken with the role of a queen ant is understandable. To graphically show what she actually does might have resulted in a NC-17 rating. Kids will be hooked by a conceit out of a fantasy (Alice in Wonderland to be exact) of a lonely 10-year-old named Lucas who is reduced to ant size by a magic potion. To illustrate how minuscule the youngster has become he floats by in a potato chip as if it were a canoe. The ants Lucas soon encounters have been given Cubist faces -- they could be more of Picassos Demoiselles dAvignon. Ingenious visuals like these put ""Ant Bully"" right up there with the best computer-generated animation. A strong story adapted from John Nickles illustrated childrens book pulls you into the ant colony along with Lucas. Hes been summoned there for blasting the insects with a hose in an attempt to annihilate them. Hes the bully in the title. His punishment decreed by the Ant Queen (a haughty-sounding Meryl Streep) is that he remain one of them until he proves himself worthy of returning to his family. The wizard ant Zoc who created the potion that shrank Lucas desires a far more dire fate for him. Nicolas Cage finds just the right perennially hopeful tone for Zoc whose desire to move up in the ranks is inhibited by insecurity. Adding to it Zocs girlfriend a nurse ant (Julia Roberts the least distinctive voice of the bunch) disobeys him by taking the boy under her wing -- or rather wings. Discovering the importance of teamwork Lucas makes friends for the first time in his life. The ultimate bonding experience is when he brings his new pals to forage at his place. Davis cleverly shows the house from the point of view of an insect. A shag rug is an impossible obstacle to negotiate on the way to the kitchen until Lucas comes up with the idea of flying over it on rose petals propelled by a fan. The bugs biggest enemy is an eager-beaver exterminator (Paul Giamatti sounding a great deal more animated than he does in ""Lady in the Water"") who has a contract out on them. Marching in full force the ants bear a resemblance to the armies in ""Star Wars"" which has to be an in-joke. From the cast alone -- wouldnt you love to see all of them in a live-action picture? -- it is apparent that Davis has moved up from ""Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius."" Although it earned him an Oscar nomination for best animated feature the animation was cheesy compared with what hes accomplished this time. Look for Davis to get another Oscar nod for the thoroughly enjoyable ""Ant Bully"" family entertainment at its best.

Ant Zoc (voiced by Nicolas Cage) and his colony hope to teach Lucas (voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen) a lesson by shrinking him down to size. If the agreeable kids movie ""The Ant Bully"" seems familiar consider this Talking animals are a staple of kids movies and only a limited number of species inhabit the Earth therefore its time for another animated-ant movie. ""Antz"" and its cousin ""A Bugs Life"" hit theaters eight years ago; by this formula we can look forward to more talking ants in around 2014. Based on the childrens book by John Nickle ""The Ant Bully"" has a certain ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" vibe to it. Young Lucas (voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen) is a small bespectacled kid whos hassled by the neighbor bullies; in turn he enjoys turning the hose on the ant hill in his front yard as theyre the only creatures around smaller than him. But he hasnt reckoned on the brainpower of a community of ants who are determined to get revenge on the creature they call The Destroyer. A drop of magic potion in his ear and suddenly Lucas is off on an ant-sized adventure in which he makes friends and learns that its important to be kind to creatures of all sizes. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""The Ant Bully"" with the voices of Julia Roberts Nicolas Cage Meryl Streep Lily Tomlin Paul Giamatti Regina King Bruce Campbell Zach Tyler Eisen Cheri Oteri Larry Miller. Written and directed by John A. Davis based on the book by John Nickle. 89 minutes. Rated PG for some mild rude humor and action. Several theaters. All this is voiced by an all-star cast indicating that just about everyone on Hollywoods A-list appreciates gigs where they dont have to sit through hair and makeup. Julia Roberts charmingly portrays the friendly ant Hova who takes on Lucas as a project; Nicolas Cage is her boyfriend Zoc who developed the potion. Meryl Streep is the voice of the serene Ant Queen a role so spot-on it feels like typecasting. On the human side Lily Tomlin screeches and bellows as Lucas eccentric grandmother Mommo and Paul Giamatti (who gets stuck playing shlumpy guys even in animated films) is the nasty local exterminator Stan Beals. Writer/director John A. Davis brings just enough rude humor to the mix; kids at the preview screening giggled delightedly when Lucas dines on caterpillar poop or when some unlucky creatures must take a walk across Beals slick dandruffy scalp. Along the way theyll learn some rudimentary ant anatomy (""Suck in that thorax"" orders Regina King as a sort of ant drill-instructor) and a few fascinating facts such as ants dont yawn. (Dont they? Obviously they didnt see ""Poseidon."") ""The Ant Bully"" isnt a kid classic but its an enjoyable diversion until the next ant movie comes along.

DavisStars Voices of Julia Roberts Nicolas Cage Meryl Streep Paul GiamattiDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG for some mild rude humor and actionRunning time 1 hour 28 minutesOpens Friday nationwide The Ant Bully feels familiar Posted 7/27/2006 1034 PM ET E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Who among us hasnt stared at ants marching with such seeming determination and pondered about their lives? The Ant Bully offers a window into their world. But so did Antz and A Bugs Life. Ant Bully while not wildly fresh or inventive is entertaining and energetic. It is also best viewed on 3-D IMAX (showing in about 50 cities in the USA and Canada) where the bugs seem to be plopping themselves on the head of the guy sitting in front of you. Tom Hanks produced the movie and secured an illustrious voice cast including Julia Roberts Nicolas Cage Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin. The story centers on Lucas a lonely 10-year-old (Zach Taylor Eisen) who bored and lonely enjoys demolishing ant hills. He is also the victim of a neighborhood bully so his malicious behavior toward the ants is also a reaction to his feelings of powerlessness. The fed-up ants demand that he stand trial for his crimes. The wizard ant Zoc (Cage) whips up a potion that shrinks Lucas down to size. Lucas is found guilty of crimes against the colony and sentenced by the Ant Queen (Streep) to live among the ants and learn their ways. As in Over the Hedge out this spring there is a strong message of ecological conservation and respect for each others differences. Though the story is predictable the message is benign and the visuals particularly in IMAX 3-D are stylized and surreal. Posted 7/27/2006 1034 PM ET E-mail | Print | Enlarge Warner Bros.

"In Ant Bully revenge is sweet-- and cute - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In Ant Bully revenge is sweet-- and cute By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  July 28 2006 The makers of Warner Bros. new animated movie ``The Ant Bully"" are taking a considerable risk thinking weve forgotten about the Great Hollywood Insect War of 1998. Surely you remember. That year ``Antz"" squared off against ``A Bugs Life"" and both movies seemed to quench forever the worlds thirst for witty pests. That of course was eight years ago just enough time for a new crop of kiddies to sprout to movie-going age and lap up the simple delights in ``The Ant Bully"" where all the ants look like designer coffee tables with golf-ball-surfaced eyes. In other words where can I buy one?Adapted from John Nickles illustrated book and directed by John A. Davis the man behind ``Jimmy Neutron"" the story is a variation on those earlier insect movies critters in jeopardy. Only now theres a playful human wrinkle. Frequently picked on by the neighborhood thug poor bespectacled 10-year-old Lucas (the voice of Zach Tyler Eisner) takes his frustration out on the ant colony in his suburban lawn turning the magnifying glass on it and then a garden hose.Down below one wizard ant Zoc (Nicolas Cage) has had it. The magic potion hes concocted actually works and one night Lucas is vengefully reduced to the puny size of his victims. Its his comedownance. Taken back to the anthill hes promptly convicted -- by Ricardo Montalbans head ant -- of crimes against the colony and sentenced by the ethereal queen (Meryl Streep of course) to live as an ant until he earns his freedom.Through Lucas the movie has a high time demonstrating that its hard out here for an ant. The amount of work required to get the tiniest of crumbs is epic. It takes a village in fact. But the tiny human boy wants no part of the elaborate obstacle courses required to attain the bright morsels of jelly bean -- excuse me ``sweet rock.""Lucas refuses to go along with any of it so obviously todays lesson is ``teamwork."" And here to help him learn it are the forager ant Kreela (Regina King) and Zocs girlfriend Hova whose name suggests the voice of Jay-Z (thats one of his aliases) but who is actually played by Julia Roberts. Much to Zocs consternation she and Lucas form a believable bond and the two are soon off along with Kreela and the macho scout ant Fugax (Bruce Campbell) to fetch more candy from Lucass house. (Jellybellys anonymous-looking jelly beans are the only products placed in this movie. Compared to the marketing bonanzas of ``Curious George"" and ``Over the Hedge"" the movies brand name chastity is farmers market quaint.)The movie has a great time playing with ideas of scope and perspective shifting between microscopic and macroscopic. Those shifts even produce a visual gag featuring an exploding firecracker that weeks later still makes me laugh. But the scenes of the ants making their way through Lucass house is a wondrous showcase for the animators imaginations. Carpet becomes a shaggy jungle and the air from a fan an ideal way to paraglide across a room.Thats the most inspired sequence in the movie and its loveliness is probably too placid for a lot of kids but who knows? The movies two battle sequences are certainly more revved up. One is against a storm of wasps. The other is against the nasty human exterminator (Paul Giamatti) of whose scalp the movie gives us a stomach-turning tour.Those two battles are so exciting that anyone old enough to remember the Great Hollywood Insect War of 1998 will be momentarily willing to let that memory go.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Ant Bully Warner Bros.) B+ The Ant Bully Genre Animation Kids and Family Comedy; Starring Nicolas Cage Alan Cumming Paul Giamatti Julia Roberts Zach Tyler; Director John A. Davis; Author John A. Davis; Release Date Wide 07/28/2006; Runtime (in minutes) 88; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 26 2006 -- 1200 AM EDT Maybe its because the Ant Queen (summers movie MVP Meryl Streep) is so excellently magisterial. Or because Nurse Ant Hova and Wizard Ant Zoc (Julia Roberts and Nicolas Cage both of them loose and playful -- yes Cage is playful not gloomy) are such a cool formicary couple. Or because the goggling goofy-glasses IMAX 3D experience (available as they say in select theaters) magnifies the charms and the dramas of very teensy insects and one temporarily tiny boy. All I know is the kind of life lessons that usually gum up the fun go down as easily as jelly beans in The Ant Bully an effortlessly clever animated confection directed by Jimmy Neutron creator John A. Davis who also wrote the screenplay. True enough its not nice to be mean. And in the beginning (as in John Nickles illustrated kids book of the same name) 10-year-old Lucas Nickle (Zach Tyler Eisen) persecutes downward stomping a convenient anthill after being tormented by the neighborhood blobby brute. And only when Lucas himself is shrunk (by oh the usual -- a magic potion whipped up by Zoc and dropped in the kids ear) does he learn what cooperation friendship and awesome ant culture are all about. Yeah yeah. Point is bugs -- and a bug-size boy --are funny. And following Monster House another PG cartoon turns out to be a secret clubhouse for the cool kids this summer.

"Ant Bully The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ant-bully-the ) Ant Bully The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Ant Bully is a sore disappointment to anyone hoping for a turnaround to the recent downward quality spiral of animated films. In fact this movie may represent a new nadir for 3D animation. Although its pretty enough to look at (although nowhere near as exquisitely rendered as Pixars Cars) the storyline - a cobbled-together stew of moralizing and pointless action sequences - is an insult to anyone with more than a second-grade education. Young kids may find The Ant Bully appealing but nearly everyone else including parents forced to sit through the movie will understand the difference between a ""family film"" and a ""childrens film"" and why this picture belongs in the latter category. How I long for the days of quality insect-oriented animated entertainment like Antz and A Bugs Life. Meet Lucas ""Peanut"" Nickle (voice of Zach Tyler) a stereotypical nerd. Mercilessly picked on by neighborhood bullies he takes out his frustration on the ants inhabiting his front lawn stomping on them and flooding their underground caverns with water from the hose. Little does Lucas know that ants arent mindless drones - theyre thinking creatures that speak with the voices of Julia Roberts Nicolas Cage Bruce Campbell Regina King Ricardo Montalban (who fails to mention ""rich Corinthian leather"" even once) and Meryl Streep. When the wizard Zoc (Cage) discovers a miniaturizing potion and pours it in Lucas ear hes diminished to ant-size faster than you can say ""Honey I shrunk the kid"" He then learns lessons about teamwork diversity and friendship from his mentor Hova (Roberts) and her companions Kreela (King) and Fugax (Campbell). This prepares him for a showdown with the Exterminator (Paul Giamatti). If your child is in need of sermons about the importance of being kind to others the value of diversity and the merits of teamwork The Ant Bully is a perfect choice. Like a preacher on speed it never stops pounding the pulpit. (Alternative probably unintentional message Ants are our friends. We shouldnt step on them.) Since small children are easily bored by prattling characters even when theyre animated to look like bugs there are plenty of inane action sequences that seem better suited as patterns for a video game than a movie. (Avoid the leaping frog Dodge the flying insect Outrun the Exterminators toxic spray Paraglide across the living room and nab a jellybean). Six year olds may be enthralled; older viewers will be fighting the urge to take a nap. This is a comedown for director John A. Davis whose previous feature Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius at least had the quality of being clever. Despite the inanity of the script Davis corralled a group of high-profile Hollywood stars to provide voices. Roberts (doing her first post-pregnancy work) Cage Streep and Giamatti have the most visible names but perhaps unsurprisingly its Bruce Campbell who provides The Ant Bully with its only juice. As the swaggering Fugax Campbells animated alter-ego is a perfect extension of the actors usual screen persona. Curiously Davis went with little-known Zach Tyler in the lead role rather than say recruiting Dakota Fanning and asking her to talk like a boy. The Ant Bully is representative of a new cynical mindset that has arisen amongst animated film distributors. Call it the Field of Dreams mentality if you make it they will come. Why bother with wit intelligence and emotion when children will be equally entertained by pretty images colorful action and the obligatory poop joke? (In this instance it occurs when poor Lucas is getting his first taste of ant food.) Its depressing to see how far animated films have fallen in such a short time. Was it only two years ago that The Incredibles were flying? Or three years ago that Nemo was swimming? Now were stuck with a personality-deprived kid shrunk so he can inhabit a world populated by a bunch of plastic ants. Forget Paul Giamatti. Someone call the Orkin Man.

Following the mindset of so many recent CG kidpics -- the gabbier the script the better -- ""The Ant Bully"" is lovely to look at but a headache to listen to. Visually dazzling cross between ""Antz"" and ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" follows a boy forced to live among insects with extremely noisy and (theres no other word for it) antic results. Launching the pic on Imax screens day-and-date with its July 28 release Warner Bros. can expect strong family turnout for its third film of the summer after ""Superman Returns"" and ""Lady in the Water"" produced and co-financed by Legendary Pictures. Adapted by helmer John A. Davis (2001s Oscar-nominated ""Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius"") from John Nickles childrens book ""The Ant Bully"" floats the fanciful collectivist notion that humans -- in this case a moody 10-year-old named Lucas (voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen) -- could learn a thing or two about selflessness and teamwork from the insect world. Repeatedly terrorized by an oversized neighborhood bully pipsqueak Lucas turns his feelings of anger and helplessness on an ant colony dwelling on his parents front lawn. Hes unaware the mound is in fact a highly sophisticated community whose six-legged members have apparently evolved the ability to speak English perform magic and narrate their history through hieroglyphics. Shortly after Lucas floods their colony with a garden hose (in a strikingly animated sequence) ant wizard Zoc (Nicolas Cage) sneaks into the boys bedroom and administers a potion that brings him literally down to size. Previously known throughout the colony as the Destroyer the now-little Lucas is brought before the ant queen (speaking in the regal tones of Meryl Streep) who decrees the boy live among the ants and be schooled in their ways. Zocs kindly girlfriend Hova (Julia Roberts) volunteers to serve as Lucas teacher and guardian with help from Kreela (Regina King) a sassy female ant and Fugax (a hammy Bruce Campbell) a lecherous drone with unusually prominent mandibles. And so begins a series of consistently eye-popping if not especially fresh adventures involving wasp attacks hungry bullfrogs a mission to retrieve jelly beans from Lucas kitchen counter and a climactic battle against an odious exterminator (Paul Giamatti). Where ""Antz"" hinged on its Woody Allen-voiced protagonists embrace of individualism ""The Ant Bully"" with its earnest endorsement of unity conformity and self-sacrifice for the greater good at times suggests a communist recruitment video. (Is it at all significant that these are red ants?) Aside from a weakness for spelling out its themes (""You just need to discover the ant within"" Hova tells Lucas) the leaden unamusing script feels obvious and overwritten with several of the characters spewing belligerent sarcasm on cue. Worst offenders are Zoc and the unsympathetic Lucas and the actors voicing both characters crank up the volume to obnoxious levels. As visually sophisticated as it is verbally flatfooted the pic realizes its magnified environs with a superbly stylized 3-D look and highly imaginative use of color. Backgrounds are stunning particularly the caverns and tunnels that make up the colony which have a magnificent palatial quality. Non-human character detail is especially sharp and expressive such as the way the wasps gleaming pod-like bodies aptly resemble fighter aircraft. Davis fluidly orchestrates the pics games with perception and dynamic shifts in scale (an exploding firecracker seen and heard first at ground level then from a humans perspective supplies more wit than anything in the screenplay). Project reteams the helmer with a number of his ""Jimmy Neutron"" collaborators including editor Jon Price and composer John Debney who wrote the memorably tuneful score. Lucas spends a lot of time running around in the buff after being downsized but pic cleverly hides the naughty bits. Lack of modesty in the later going however was apparently enough to warrant a PG rating.
