TWITTER 6/9/2016 Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as real-life demonologists a this time tackling a haunting in working-class England a in James Wans sequel to his 2013 horror hit. Theyre ba-aack. Three years after The Conjuring rattled the multiplex with old-school horror director James Wan ups the ante with an excellent sequel. His focus again is a documented case from the files of the Warrens of Connecticut the shockingly white-bread demon fighters whose involvement with the so-called Amityville Horror put them on the pop-culture map -- and also made them objects of derision. Wans expert deployment of genre jolts is no less in evidence this time around but as he takes his time -- perhaps even a bit too much of it -- interweaving the Warrens story with that of the Hodgsons in the London borough of Enfield he crafts a deep dive into dread. The film builds to a symphonic climax of heaven-and-hell emotion. The returning Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson imbue the roles of Lorraine and Ed Warren with the kind of lived-in nuance that illuminates their recent brilliant work on cable series -- Bates Motel and Fargo respectively shows that traffic in their own brands of horror. Along with an excellent Madison Wolfe as the 11-year-old girl whos tormented by a restless spirit or perhaps something worse they lead an ace cast in a terrifically atmospheric plunge into 70s-vibe melancholy. Therell be nothing shocking about the features muscle at the box office. Where the first film found the Warrens in the relative anonymity of their pre-Amityville days The Conjuring 2 is set a decade later when the clairvoyant Lorraine has insisted they take a break from case work. Its not merely an attempt to lay low amid a mounting tide of talk-show scorn; shes shaken to the core by a vision she had during their Amityville investigation -- brought to chilling life in the seance sequence that opens the movie. But when the Catholic Church requests their assessment of a troublingly intractable situation in England they pack their Bible and go. The screenplay credited to Chad Hayes Carey W. Hayes James Wan and David Leslie Johnson structures its based-on-true-events drama as a tale of two households in distress bringing them together after a somewhat distended hour. For single mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances OConnor) and her four children life has turned into a constant state of emergency especially for Janet (Wolfe) whos sleepless from being tossed-about levitated and frequently possessed by an angry entity who claims he wants his home back. That home a council house with crumbling paint and moldering corners stands as a gloomy embodiment of domestic despair and economic uncertainty; the childrens father has abandoned the family and the Thatcher era has dawned. But even as the eerily unfinished basement fills with water the upstairs bedroom of Janet and her older sister Margaret (Lauren Esposito) its walls bedecked with David Soul posters is alive with tween dreams -- until it becomes the locus of the familys nightmare. The house is an extraordinary creation by production designer Julie Berghoff one of several key creative collaborators who have worked with Wan on both movies; the others are costume designer Kristin M. Burke editor Kirk Morri and composer Joseph Bishara and their contributions are essential to the films dark power. With their clear direct language and compassion the Warrens arrive as a source of hope and stability for the Hodgsons including the two youngest (Benjamin Haigh Patrick McAuley) and their sympathetic neighbors (Maria Doyle Kennedy and Simon Delaney). Open-minded but unconvinced of the nature of the households troubles Lorraine and Ed cant dissuade parapsychologist Anita Gregory (Franka Potente) from her aggressive naysaying. (Charges of ""childrens pranks"" still dog the events in Enfield which also were the subject of a 2015 British TV series.) The Warrens straightforward earnestness fuels the film more so than their Catholicism. Amid the chills and thrills the childhood anxieties and vulnerability Wan has made a celebration of the demonologist duos marriage. (As she was on the first film Lorraine Warren 89 is credited as a consultant here as are three of the Hodgson children.) In this Conjuring the haunted-house tropes play second fiddle to something less graspable even though theres no question that a game of fright is in full masterful swing. Cinematographer Don Burgess camera prowls and swoops Bisharas choral score sends shivers up the spine and Wan uses prolonged silence as well as sounds -- creaking floorboards a screeching backyard swing -- to maximum unsettling effect. The director knows how to turn objects from an antique zoetrope to a ringing telephone into icons of free-floating evil or in the case of a crucifix into tools of redemption. Yet incidents of Janets possession however well realized grow repetitive. At the same time Potentes character is curiously sidelined for much of the action when a more thorough integration of her skepticism into the story would only have enriched it. Another investigator on the other hand enhances the pic in unpredictable ways. Played with compelling ambiguity by Simon McBurney amateur researcher Maurice Grosse begins as something of a well-meaning nuisance if also a much-needed supporter. The moment when he reveals in a few guileless words what drew him to the paranormal the movies stake in matters of love and heartbreak longing and mourning is brought into sharp relief.

The intrusion at first is low-grade; the fact that the TV remote wont stay put is not one feels the stuff of nightmares. By the end however Janet is being sucked through the ceiling knives are on the loose and only a fool would risk a tour of the cellar. That fool is Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) who with his wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) travels to England to investigate the haunting and it seems odd that the director James Wan should take almost half the movie to get them to the scene of the crime. If it really is a crime; the film is based on a true story and what happened in Enfield in 1977 has often been diagnosed as a case of pranks and jinks. The whole saga bears definite traces of domestic comedy but Wan is at pains to ignore them preferring an old-school parade of creaking doors sputtering lights and demonic jolts. Still his framing of the scares is artfully managed and it is the accomplished Wolfe rather than any monster who takes true possession of the tale.      --Anthony Lane Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

But genre fans able to look beyond that lazy distinction have marvelled watching Wan morph into one of Hollywoods most versatile filmmakers. After playing on a huge action canvas with last years Furious 7 Wan is back working on a more intimate scale with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga in The Conjuring 2. A sequel to his 2013 smash the story deals with Englands Enfield Haunting -- a highly documented 1977 case involving a single mother Penny Hodgson (Frances OConnor) her four children and a terrifying entity that targets her 11-year-old daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe). The former homeowner 72-year-old Bill Wilkins (Bob Adrian) died in his favourite chair and he doesnt want to leave telling the family over and over ""This is my home"" Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Wilson and Farmiga) are dispatched to north London to see if the poltergeist is truly demonic. The film opens with a sequence that takes place at the site of the Amityville murders -- perhaps the Warrens most famous case. But a vision that Lorraine sees there prompts her to put a stop to their investigations. They are lured to England to see if the Enfield case is a hoax and because helping people is the couples mission. The Catholic Church wants the Warrens there just to observe and see if the Enfield case might be nothing more than an elaborate way for a single mom to obtain better housing. If the first film provided plenty of chills The Conjuring 2 is a slow build; and layered beneath the inexplicable scares is a thoughtful love story between Ed and Lorraine. As the two battle otherworldly threats beyond explanation Wan along with co-screenwriters Chad Hayes David Leslie Johnson and Carey Hayes takes time to show us scenes of intimacy between the couple -- a slow dance and a scene where Ed sings Cant Help Falling in Love come to mind -- that makes us forget the creepy moments. The film is also gorgeously shot with sweeping camera angles and long takes during some of the demonic possession scenes that are both a credit to Wan as a filmmaker and Wolfes tremendous acting skills. He doesnt use jump-cuts or fake scares to build tension. You always get the sense that the Hodgsons are being targeted by something that is truly out of their control and thats the biggest scare of all.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 10 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 10 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by James Wan Written by Chad Hayes Carey Hayes James Wan and David Leslie Johnson Starring Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson Classification 14A Country USA Language English God moves in mysterious ways but the devil makes a racket.As we saw in 1973 with The Exorcist the underworlds most villainous are noisy attention-seekers who hate household furniture. As The New York Times Vincent Canby wrote in his review of William Friedkins pea-soup classic ""The devil it seems for all his supposed powers cant break and enter without sounding like Laurel and Hardy trying to move a piano."" We see similarly raucous demonic situations in The Conjuring 2 James Wans stylish sequel to his supernatural-horror hit of 2013. The soundtrack plays Christmas carols but theres nothing silent about the nights in a house taken over by rude spirits with the loud fuss meant to lure then snare a pair of paranormal investigators.They are Lorraine and Ed Warren a real-life couple played once again by the damn good actors Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. They are deeply devoted to each other their marital compatibility so persuasively conveyed by Farmiga and Wilson that youll swear you can still taste their wedding cake.Where The Conjuring took place in Rhode Island this film splits its time on both sides of the Atlantic. We see the Warrens as comfortably middle-class living in a home of shag rugs wood-panelled walls and plaid furniture. Lorraine wears a crochet vest; Ed sports statement sideburns. The seventies - the horrorThe film begins with a flashback seance in Amityville site of an infamous house and the dreadfulness within. Lorraine who has a ""God-given gift"" for connecting with displaced spirits is so traumatized by her experience there that she asks her husband that they no longer conduct on-site investigations. He agrees.Meanwhile over in North London a shambolic abode is dominated by a kids bedroom splashed with David Soul posters and television sets overwhelmed by flickering images of Margaret Thatcher. The domestic situation is not as cozy here where four kids live in relative squalor. The mother (played by Frances OConnor) is loving but overwhelmed. The two daughters using a homemade ouija board ask if their philandering father is coming back and one of the boys asks mum the same question. Signs point to no.Amid this gorgeously shot and smartly conceived 133 minutes of jump scares and chilling moments there is a not-so-subtle religious subtext. A ""leap of faith"" is encouraged more than once and there are more crucifixes in this Christmas-set film than in a Vatican gift shops going-out-of-business sale. While the compassionate Bible-carrying Warrens live comfortably in the impoverished and frightened single-mother household the youngest boy (perhaps distressed due to an absent father) stutters and a growling 11-year-old girl (portrayed excellently by Madison Wolfe) is possessed by Linda Blair the agitated spirit of an old man - or something even more malicious.At one point Simon McBurney (wonderful as British paranormal sleuth Maurice Grosse) explains his wish to believe His daughter died young and hed like to think that she ""still exists somewhere.""As you probably guessed the Warrens decide to renege on their decision to retire from scary-house visiting. They head off to rainy North London where they take on an investigation into the demonic deal going down at the Hodgson house the site of a real-life paranormal case - ""Englands Amityville.""Further details of the plot should not be revealed. But moviegoers should know this isnt a horror film made just for teenagers - though theyll be on the edge of their knapsacks all right - but for adults as well. The humour isnt gag-ridden. When someone wonders which is worse the demon or the pursuit of the demon Farmigas Lorraine answers with a perfect facial expression and tone shaking her head every way but literally ""The demon the demon is worse.""Okay perhaps that line doesnt come off so well in print. But it is funny - take my word for it.And believe me on The Conjuring 2 a supernatural winner bound to make some noise at the box office and worthy of loud applause.

Madison Wolfe plays Janet Hodgson the preteen who is possessed by an evil apparition. by Tirdad Derakhshani Staff Writer Close icon Tirdad Derakhshani Staff Writer Horror meister James Wan creator of the seven-film Saw nightmare worked hard to escape the sequel curse in the follow-on to his well-reviewed 2013 demonic shocker The Conjuring. And it shows. Slideshow The Conjuring 2 A sequel of epic pretensions Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon The Conjuring 2 is a complicated multi-segmented narrative thats much longer more elaborate more dramatic and more packed with chilling moments and hair-raising visuals than one could anticipate even from Wan. Returning stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson act their hearts out as real-life ghost-and-ghoul hunters Lorraine and Ed Warren. The film a horror flick with the chutzpah to run 133 minutes tries at real emotional depth and complex plotting. It tries in other words to reach epic status. Does it succeed? Eh I guess so. Theres a lot more here than in the first film but it doesnt feel quite as exciting. A postmodern American Gothic bouillabaisse The Conjuring 2 opens with what seems to be a sequel to The Amityville Horror with the Warrens investigating the house made famous by a half-dozen films including Stuart Rosenbergs 1979 classic. Just as were settling down into the story the scene changes and the Warrens are off to England and another famous case the Enfield Haunting also the subject of books and flicks. But Wans film isnt merely a meta tourist jaunt through horror movie history. Once it takes root in England it blossoms into a full-blooded thriller. Wan pulls out all the stops - does he ever - as he takes us through a warped story about a working-class single mum Peggy Hodgson (Frances OConnor) whose life is turned inside out by an evil apparition that takes up residence in Peggys preteen daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe). I sometimes confuse the Conjuring pics with the Insidious franchise of demon-infestation flicks which features Lin Shaye as a very Lorraine Warren-like psychic and ghoul-exterminator. Wans films however have heart. Maybe even a soul. tirdadphillynews.com 215-854-2736 MOVIE REVIEW The Conjuring 2 sss (Out of four stars) yDirected by James Wan.

"Review Conjuring 2 scares but not as well as the first Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Review Conjuring 2 scares but not as well as the first By LINDSEY BAHR Jun. 7 2016 350 PM EDT Share article 10 photos This image released by Warner Bros. shows Madison Wolfe in a scene from the New Line Cinema thriller ""The Conjuring 2."" (Warner Bros. via AP) i By LINDSEY BAHR (AP)Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.If ""The Conjuring"" was a chilling whisper the sequel is a deafening shriek. That might not be a bad thing for some but the shock jumps and cheesy-looking demons in ""The Conjuring 2 "" were a definite departure from the first and not necessarily for the better. The brilliance of director James Wans elegant original film was how it used our own horror savvy against us. Hed allow for a long take of a terrified girl peering under her bed and let it stay there long enough to the point where your muscles start to tense. You instinctively brace for the shock that you know is coming ... and then ... nothing. At that point a creepy face or a loud knock on the door wasnt actually needed. The suspense was more than sufficient. The audience was already petrified. ""The Conjuring 2"" however goes all out. Its even louder somehow. And there are more demons more jump scares more creepy antique toys and thankfully more Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) the most delightfully campy couple of supernaturally sensitive marrieds ever to grace the screen. Theyre like everyones favorite Sunday School teachers -- shes the earthy one hes the groovy one. You know theyve seen some darkness too but then Ed grabs a guitar and starts crooning ""Cant Help Falling in Love"" and you forget all about the demon spirit lurking in the tattered leather armchair in the corner of the living room. Heck the cranky dead man in the corner terrorizing a working-class family outside of London probably even enjoyed Eds Elvis impersonation too. Oh right theres a cranky dead man in the corner because this is a horror movie and not just a quirky romance about the Warrens. The story deals with the Enfield Poltergeist -- a highly documented 1977 case about a single mother Peggy Hodgson (played here by Frances OConnor); her four children; and the strange and terrifying happenings in their small home. As with most stories about haunted houses it starts small -- bumps and voices and knocks mysterious bites and sheets that fly off of children in the middle of the night -- and escalates quickly to demonic possession of an 11-year-old girl Janet (Madison Wolfe) by a 72-year-old Bill Wilkins (Bob Adrian). This time though the Warrens have their own issues. In a prologue about the Amityville murders Lorraine sees something that scares her so deeply she has no choice but to put her foot down and demand that she and Ed stop this business of paranormal investigation. They can do the lecture and the press circuit sure but no more of this getting inside heads. Meanwhile the whole industry of paranormal investigation is being picked apart by naysayers in the press so when the Enfield situation springs up the Catholic Church basically asks the Warrens to go ahead and try to get proof first to save the church from another embarrassing hoax situation. While interesting the constant skepticism and wavering trust also work to dull the fun of the scares. Is the audience supposed to doubt little Janet too? Its never really clear. The film is also way too long and the tricks end up feeling a little repetitive and obvious although theres a really great sequence in the Warrens home with a creepy picture that Ed painted. The horror sequel is a tough thing to pull off in general and ""The Conjuring 2"" is most certainly one of the better efforts. The case files of the Warrens should provide some wickedly fun material for many sequels to come. But for better or worse the first movie was just too good and ""The Conjuring 2"" cant hold a candle to its predecessor. ___ ""The Conjuring 2"" a Warner Bros. release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""terror and horror violence.""

Amy On Film The Conjuring 2 An Adorable Haunting In 1970s London Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga travel across the pond to deal with a British poltergeist -- and about every other kind of paranormal activity you can think of Amy Nicholson 06/09/2016 TheAmyNicholson Whats worse Being attacked by a ghost or being attacked by skeptics who dont believe your ghost story? Thats the big question behind The Conjuring 2 a sequel to the shockingly profitable hit which flies husband-and-wife paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren from 1971 New England to 1977 London where they tangle with the Enfield Poltergeist a real-life case thats still hotly debated as a fraud. Over a montage of British iconography -- Margaret Thatcher; guards in furry hats; punk rockers; and working-class chain-smoking children -- director James Wan blasts The Clashs ""London Calling"" even though that wont be released for another two years. Maybe Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) a mentalist psychically predicted it? The Conjurer Our victims are single mom Peggy Hodgson (Frances OConnor) and her four kids broke wretches with accents borrowed from the Cratchits. (Some of the child actors were forced to wear crooked false teeth.) Their row house is in shambles even before the cabinets start shaking. The paint is peeling the walls are smudged and the wood floors look rotten and damp. When Peggy confesses that her louse ex-husband kept the previous owners furniture an old man named Bill Wilkins who died in a downstairs chair we arent surprised. The wake was probably the last time the place got cleaned. Alas for youngest daughter Janet (a heartbreaking Madison Wolfe) the mans ghost likes to torture her with pranks. At first its minor annoyances like hidden remote controls and locked doors. Quickly it escalates with Janet delighting newscasters by channeling the dead mans voice. If you read English papers in 1977 Enfield was a major story. A police woman went on record as seeing a chair skid across the floor and over 30 other witnesses reported being hit with hot-to-the-touch Legos or seeing Janet levitate through her bedroom window. Mostly however Janets possession was dismissed as a hoax especially when photos of her levitations just looked like an 11-year-old girl jumping off the bed. Enter the Warrens (Patrick Wilson and Farmiga) who fly overseas and spend three-quarters of the film wondering if they should trust their minds -- or really their hearts as Farmigas empathetic Lorraine has the kind of watery blue eyes that flood with tears. Wan and his co-screenwriters David Leslie Johnson and Carey and Chad Hayes try to have it both ways. They linger on the scenes of the Warrens reluctance but tell us up-front in the first act that Janets terror is real. We see the dressers fly across the room and the familys petrified faces. We know they arent lying. So when our ""experts"" drag their feet they look like dummies. After all they literally live above a flea market of horrors assembled from relics of hundreds of past cases including that dreaded doll Annabelle. Why are they giving poor Janet such a hard time? At least Wilson plays Ed Warren like a lovable dolt. When a fellow researcher shows up with a newfangled VHS camera roughly the size of a toaster oven Ed beams ""Its so small and light"" The problem with the original Conjuring is it felt like a checklist of horror cliches. Creepy music box? Check. Crab-walking demon woman? Check. Creepy invisible friend? Like duh. By the time Wan unleashed a flock of killer birds the only thing I felt like screaming was ""Bingo"" Ditto Conjuring 2. Dear old dead Bill would be plenty -- he sure was for the Hodgsons -- yet Wan cant resist throwing in everything from a demonic nun to an evil kinetoscope to a shape-shifting dog. Its less a haunted house than a spectral grab bag. But when building suspense more means less. The best nightmares come from a simple premise like Freddy Kruegers ""Dont fall asleep."" Audiences like rules -- they make us feel sick to our stomachs when characters break them. Here the scares are so scattered that its hard to be afraid of anything except the most basic gimmick a dark hallway and the predictable countdown till something goes ""BOO"" The Conjuring 2 is more adorable than frightening. The house is cluttered with fabulous retro junk like pin-ups of Starsky and Hutch. The actors wear gleefully tacky 70s sweaters -- crazy knits and crocheted sweater vests and argyle cardigans -- and the climax is perked up by Farmigas powder blue trench coat. When she slogs through a basement filled with waist-high water my heart skipped a beat Please dont ruin your jacket At least Wilson and Farmiga are so sincere and nerdy that their fictional marriage feels real. We arent scared for them but theyre convincingly scared for each other. The jolts almost feel like enduring a horror film within a better drama. The suspense isnt ""How do we slay the ghoul?"" Its ""Gosh I hope these nice kids survive to their next anniversary."" In reality the Warrens werent heroes. They crossed the Atlantic simply to greet the cockney poltergeist and then flew back home the next day. (According to lead investigator Guy Lyon Playfair they showed up uninvited.) The ghost if there was one stayed. The media frenzy moved on. Janet moved out at 16. Her mother stubbornly stayed at Enfield until she died. The houses next residents fled after two months when the son saw a man walk into his bedroom. Today Janet now a soft-spoken 50-year-old shuns the press. Shes not thrilled about seeing her life turned into fiction. During her only TV interview in three decades she sat under the harsh lights while yet another stranger called her a liar. She didnt flinch. Finally Janet stuck up for herself in the polite yet earnest voice of a woman whos been through enough. ""You wasnt there love. You dont know. You dont know what I went through or how I feel today. It will always be with me."" She tapped her temple with two fingers. ""In here."" I wish The Conjuring 2 calmed down enough to show us what nightmares still live in Janets head -- her quiet conviction is more chilling than three-dozen spinning crucifixes.

"Conjuring 2 The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; conjuring-2-the ) Conjuring 2 The (United States 2016) June 09 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli James Wan is among the best horror directors working today. His filmography reads like a ""best of"" modern scary movies and The Conjuring 2 is a worthy addition to the list. Although the successful box office performance of The Conjuring was the driving force behind the development of the sequel Wan didnt take the lazy route traveled by many filmmakers. He devoted a significant creative effort to this movie; the resulting payoff should make both horror movie fans and Warner Brothers grateful. The Conjuring 2 proves that with a sufficient investment of time and energy sequels dont have to be unsatisfying cash-grabs. The Conjuring 2 tells another ""based on a true story"" tale from the supernatural catalog of real-life ghostbuster Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga). This one takes place in the late 1970s and doesnt require the viewer to have seen The Conjuring. The prologue provides a window into Ed and Lorraines involvement in the infamous Amityville haunting but this is merely a jumping-off point for the main story (although a crucial tie-in isnt revealed until later). The bulk of The Conjuring 2 concerns Englands infamous ""Enfield Poltergeist"" a supernatural occurrence that received much contemporary press and was hotly debated between skeptics and believers. The film for obvious reasons sides with the latter group. (This would after all be an entirely different movie if the intent was to disprove the existence of demons.) Wan takes care to develop the U.K. portions of the film without rushing ahead. Along the way he provides enough scares to keep viewers interested but Ed and Lorraine make only occasional appearances in the movies first hour. During this portion of The Conjuring 2 we are introduced to the Hodgsons (single) mother Peggy (Frances OConnor) 13-year old Margaret (Lauren Esposito) 11-year old Janet (Madison Wolfe) 10-year old Johnny (Patrick McAuley) and 7-year old Billy (Benjamin Haigh). The haunting of their flat focuses on Janet who has the most vivid experiences with a frightful spirit who insists that this is his house and they must leave. Day after day the familys encounters become more disturbing and after one especially frightening instance they call the police - who upon arriving to investigate see and hear things they cant explain. Enter Ed and Lorraine who arrives as observers for the Church. Although initially tasked only with determining whether the Hodgsons situation is a hoax they become involved when Lorraine senses an incursion by a familiar nemesis. One of the best decisions made by the filmmakers was to allow The Conjuring 2 to carry an R-rating. Theres nothing salacious in the movie - its largely devoid of violence (at least of the graphic sort) and has no sex or profanity. What it contains however is the kind of pervasive dread that is impossible to justify in a PG-13 production. The Conjuring 2 relies more intensely on this than on its occasional ""boo"" moment jump-scares. Wans camera movement is crucial. He prefers long takes (there are numerous extended tracking shots) and things happen on the edges of the frame as the camera moves around a corner. Although The Conjuring 2 resides in the pro-haunting camp as far as the Enfield Poltergeist is concerned it acknowledges that some aspects of the case may have been faked. The skeptics perspective is provided by investigator Anita Gregory (Franka Potente) whose video tapes contain what she deems to be incontrovertible evidence of the hoax. Wan doesnt cheapen her character by providing her with an unlikely and unbelievable ""conversion."" She remains unconvinced to the very end. The Warrens find a local ally in Maurice Grosse (Simon McBurney) who is yang to Anitas ying. As was true in The Conjuring Ed and Lorraine remain pillars of strength even though both admit to being frightened by the forces they are facing. Theres also an element of danger hinted at in one of Lorraines visions. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga sell the characters and their situation presenting the Warrens not as publicity-seeking opportunists (as their critics have often painted them) but as likable individuals whose chief goal is to provide relief to those experiencing the hauntings. The British cast is solid with special a nod to Madison Wolfe whose performance as Janet requires a Linda Blair-esque range. There are enough unfilmed case files for the Warrens to make a return in The Conjuring 3 and if the actors and (more importantly) James Wan were interested in another installment Id greet it with considerably more enthusiasm than I normally reserve for sequels. The Conjuring 2 establishes Ed and Lorraine as being franchise-worthy. Whats more by finding a balance between intense horror and character-based dramatic elements it illustrates that its possible to shine in an genre that has become polluted by too many PG-13 ghost stories and cheap found footage garbage. Come December Id be surprised if The Conjuring 2 doesnt stand out as 2016s best-in-horror.

Credit Matt Kennedy/Warner Bros. Pictures The 2013 film ""The Conjuring"" about a possessed farmhouse in Rhode Island was one of the better horror movies to come along in a while and ""The Conjuring 2"" does everything you want a sequel to do. Its as well made as the original but the location and the story are different enough that its not just the same thing all over again.That said you do need a little patience as this one builds slowly. Its another case from the files of Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson reprising their roles from the first movie) the real-life couple who attained a certain fame as paranormal investigators from the well-known occurrences in Amityville N.Y. in the mid-1970s. That investigation gets a shout-out at the beginning of this film but the real focus is their work in 1977 the year after they visited Amityville in the borough of Enfield in North London.

Watch in Times Video >> embed There a single mother (Frances OConnor) with four children reported bizarre violent goings-on in the familys home. The setting -- Britain public housing -- distinguishes this film from the original although with the exception of one neighbor theres a curious indifference among nearby residents in this urban setting to the racket.In any case Ms. Farmiga and Mr. Wilson again sell their characters pretty well and a youngster named Madison Wolfe makes quite an impression as Janet the child who absorbs the brunt of the poltergeists abuse. Skip this film if you cant suspend disbelief; its entertainment not a documentary and though the characters of course discuss whether the haunting is real thats not what the director James Wan is interested in. He wants to scare and unsettle you and does. ""The Conjuring 2"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for horror violence some of it pretty intense.

"James Wans touch makes The Conjuring 2 a worthy shivery sequel - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review James Wans touch makes The Conjuring 2 a worthy shivery sequel ""The Conjuring 2"" Warner Bros. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga in the supernatural thriller ""The Conjuring 2."" Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga in the supernatural thriller ""The Conjuring 2."" (Warner Bros.) Justin Chang Set in a gloomy North London council house in 1977 ""The Conjuring 2"" is a work of British kitchen-sink realism in the guise of a supernatural thriller Call it Ken Loachs ""Poltergeist"" or perhaps ""The Exorcist"" as imagined by a young Mike Leigh. The actual director is James Wan who has followed up his superb ""The Conjuring"" (2013) with another virtuosic exercise in mobile camerawork and moldering production design tethered to a story that handles its characters and their working-class milieu with an unexpectedly grounded sensitive touch. Generous with jolts but devoid of gratuitous bloodshed these are the rare horror movies that seem more interested in how people live than how they die.The sequel picks up several years after the events of ""The Conjuring"" which introduced us to Ed and Lorraine Warren (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) a real-life married couple who devoted their lives to investigating the paranormal most famously the Amityville Horror in 1976. Chillingly re-enacted here in a prologue worthy of ""In Cold Blood"" that notorious case took a terrible toll on the Warrens and has left Lorraine especially reluctant to leave their New England home to chase yet another haunting. History and Hollywood alas have left them little choice. Loosely based on a series of wall-rattling furniture-throwing and thoroughly hair-raising events that gripped the London borough of Enfield in the late 70s ""The Conjuring 2"" takes its time flying the Warrens across the Atlantic. (A bit too much time given the films generous 134-minute length.) The Enfield demon likes to get to know its victims first Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) an impressionable 13-year-old whom we first see fiddling with a homemade spirit board and then her three siblings and eventually their single mother Peggy (the excellent Frances OConnor) whos already at her wits end trying to keep food on the table.The terrors that befall this struggling family are nothing you havent seen before chairs that rock of their own accord a TV that suddenly switches channels (never more scarily than when it lands on Margaret Thatcher) guttural voices and possessed toys and doors that go bump in the night. But Wan has a gift for investing even the creakiest cliches with shivery elan. He has always been a versatile connoisseur of genre thrills (his credits include ""Furious 7"" the original ""Saw"" and the two ""Insidious"" movies) but there is something about the Warrens case files that pushes his filmmaking into the realm of the rhapsodic. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Evincing a patience and mastery of mise-en-scene increasingly rare in mainstream horror cinema Wan isnt above resorting to a good cheap shock and he has one bogeywoman up his sleeve so frighteningly effective -- lets just call her literally the nun from hell -- that even the movie cant stifle a nervous giggle. But Wans real talent is for modulation for elongated sequences that build and build with breathless intensity. Working with the cinematographer Don Burgess he sends the camera hurtling in and out of rooms up and down hallways and at one point right through the floor so that it comes out on the other side pressed up against the ceiling The freer the sense of movement the more harrowing the sense of no escape.Theres real feeling beneath all that technique. What keeps ""The Conjuring 2"" from coming across as just another retread is its sympathetic understanding of how trapped the Hodgsons are -- not just by the ghoulish entity that has taken over their flat (or perhaps it never went away) but also by the more mundane forces of poverty isolation and despair. Things arent magically solved once the Warrens finally show up; on the contrary their arrival prompts a dangerous shift in the demons strategy. But one of their most telling and applicable insights is that evil feeds -- and thrives -- on everyday human anxiety.Pointedly it also thrives on the efforts of a professional skeptic (Franka Potente too long absent from the big screen) who is determined to expose the Hodgsons ordeal as a massive hoax. The Warrens for their part are somewhat straitjacketed by the rigor of their methods. (Ed died in 2006; Lorraine now retired served as a consultant on both ""Conjuring"" films.) As representatives of the Catholic Church they must find decisive proof of paranormal activity before taking action and Wan (one of four credited screenwriters) has diabolical fun poring over the evidence assembling the Warrens case and then dismantling it all over again.Much like its predecessor then ""The Conjuring 2"" is a faith-based freakout at heart It ruthlessly exploits the spectacle of demonic possession treats disbelief as a dangerous enemy and finds a vital antidote in the warm embrace of a loving God-fearing family. Depending on their persuasion some audiences may find this an off-puttingly conservative stance which is why the focus on the Warrens is such a masterstroke It would take a more agnostic critic than this one not to be disarmed by their evangelical-Nick-and-Nora routine. Its hard to resist Wilsons goofily square charm (look out for the worlds most incongruous Elvis impersonation) let alone the extraordinary commingling of fear kindness and conviction in Farmigas otherworldly gaze. Wan is shrewd enough to recognize that the appeal of his characters goes beyond their specific ideology. In horror movies as in matters of the soul a little decency goes a long way.------------The Conjuring 2MPAA rating R for terror and horror violenceRunning time 2 hours 14 minutesPlaying In wide releasejustin.changlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times James Wan Vera Farmiga Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-conjuring-2-review-20160606-snap-story.html,200,theconjuring10,theconjuring,latimes

(Credit Warner Bros. Pictures) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren find a new mystery in England.CAST Vera Farmiga Patrick Wilson Madison WolfeRATED R (gruesome imagery)LENGTH 211BOTTOM LINE Another year another mix of ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Exorcist."" Solid acting and an emotional back story set this one slightly apart. James Wans 2013 horror film ""The Conjuring"" marked a slight peak in a genre that often feels like one big valley. Critics generally overlooked that it ripped off three of the most rehashed horror titles in history -- ""The Exorcist"" ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""Poltergeist"" -- and instead praised the above-average acting and skillful scare tactics. The movie was no masterpiece; it just seemed like one compared to the umpteenth ""Paranormal Activity."" After a spinoff ""Annabelle"" the franchise continues with ""The Conjuring 2."" Its blueprint is agonizingly familiar although Wan (who directed and co-wrote) adds a nice change of scenery -- England in 1977 -- and an emotional undercurrent that proves surprisingly compelling. Otherwise in terms of cast story and overall quality youre watching the same movie for the third time. advertisement | advertise on newsday We begin with paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren once again played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga conducting a seance in that famous Dutch Colonial in Amityville. Struck by a vision of her husbands death Lorraine insists that they take a work hiatus. It isnt long however before the Catholic Church beckons them to Enfield England where the Hodgson family is under siege by a hostile spirit. Enfield makes for a fresh backdrop to the somewhat stale proceedings. Its a working-class suburb of London and the Hodgson family has a distinctly British flavor. Peggy a stressed-out single mom played by a convincing Frances OConnor is convinced that her youngest daughter Janet (a very good Madison Wolfe) is possessed by the ghost of a crotchety old man who once lived in their council flat. You know what follows Toys move on their own shadows grow on walls and something seems to lurk in the childrens makeshift tent. One of the movies best and most unexpected aspects is the love between the Warrens. Although Wilson remains a low-key presence Farmiga exudes enough emotion for both of them and we feel her fear at losing the only person who truly understands her. That gives ""The Conjuring 2"" some added substance even if the movie is generally business as usual.

Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures MOVIE REVIEW THE CONJURING 2 Running time 133 minutes. Rated R (violence). Theres no shortage of shocks in the ""The Conjuring 2 a mostly satisfying follow-up that brings back the excellent Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren the real-life paranormal experts most famous for investigating ""The Amityville Horror house. Returning director James Wan teases us with a five-minute pre-credits prologue depicting one of Lorraines demonic encounters in Amityville in 1976 -- five years after the case in the first ""Conjuring -- so unnerving to Lorraine that she begs Ed to hang up their crucifixes for a while. Meanwhile in the London borough of Enfield 11-year-old Janet Hodgson (a very good Madison Wolfe) is showing signs of possession -- including levitation and speaking in the very creepy voice of an old dead man who wants her family out of the grim public housing unit where he formerly lived. Its even scarier than Margaret Thatcher on the telly. As bizarre incidents pile up experts debate whether its a hoax and Janets beleaguered single mother (Frances OConnor) reaches out to the Roman Catholic church for help. But before theyll send an exorcist they dispatch the deeply devout Warrens to see whether the Hodgsons are on the level. Arriving in London nearly an hour into this overlong sequel (21 minutes longer than the original) the Warrens are inclined to believe the Hodgsons -- although Lorraines trusty extrasensory perception is having trouble tuning in any bad spirits. Still shes worried that an apparition of a scary white-faced nun who gave her a premonition of Eds death back in Amityville may somehow figure in the new case. Like the first ""Conjuring the successor is heavy on period atmosphere -- from the David Soul poster on Janets wall to Eds amazement at how ""small and light the eras new professional camcorders can be (of course they look massive to us). Wan gives the top-drawer cast -- including Simon McBurney and Franka Potente as paranormal experts and Lauren Esposito Benjamin Haigh and Patrick McAuley as Janets terrified siblings -- plenty of nice acting moments. And he certainly has a way with sinister antique toys. But ""The Conjuring 2 belongs to Wilson and Farmiga as the sincere loving slightly square Warrens with Wan tightening the screws for a rousing series of cliffhangers that should have audiences screaming. Expect another sequel for sure.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan June 9 Real-life ghostbuster Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) finds more than she bargained for in ""The Conjuring 2."" (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) As a filmmaker James Wan plays to the reptilian brain of his audience orchestrating such autonomous body functions as heart rate breath and goosebumps like a maestro. In movies from ""Saw"" to ""Furious 7"" and now ""The Conjuring 2"" a sequel to his ghostly 2013 hit the filmmaker bypasses higher brain function plugging directly into the peanut-shaped circuit board -- buried deep beneath your to-do lists -- that makes you jump out of your skin when you hear a loud noise. If ""The Conjuring 2"" is not quite the achievement of the original (and what sequel is?) it nevertheless manifests a canny understanding of what modern audiences expect from a ghost story delivering slowly mounting dread punctuated by alternating bursts of terror and laughter. [The Conjuring review One heck of a ghost story] Set in 1977 England and inspired by events that have come to be known as the Enfield Haunting (from the North London borough in which they took place) the film centers on a working-class family of five. Single mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances OConnor) and her four children are terrorized by the ghost of a former occupant of their shabby house Bill Wilkins (Bob Adrian) after her youngest daughter 11-year-old Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) opens the door to the underworld by messing around with a Ouija board. Its certainly not the first time weve seen the spirit-board gimmick used to invite a malevolent entity to pass through the veil between this world and the next. Working from a script Wan co-wrote with ""The Conjuring"" sibling screenwriters Carey and Chad Hayes and David Johnson (""Orphan"") the filmmaker demonstrates that he is not averse to reusing dusty old tropes a creepy mechanical toy levitation a seemingly possessed television set -- all these cliches and more are trotted out in service of the desired effect while exhibiting only minimal signs of wear. (One doesnt fault Brahms for using the same notes as Beethoven does one? It also should be noted that the real Hodgsons are purported to have triggered their poltergeist attack with an ill-advised Ouija session.) Young Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) gets the trouble started with a Ouija board session gone wrong. (Warner Bros. Pictures) Other aspects of the story are less faithful although to its credit ""The Conjuring 2"" does include a character (Franka Potente) who exists merely to debunk the Hodgsons claims of haunting. Accusations of a hoax have swirled around the Enfield case since the 1970s and it helps that Wan acknowledges this inoculating the film -- if only a tad -- against charges of excessive credulity. [The Summer Movie Guide Sequels superheroes and blockbusters] It takes a while for the films real stars to show up. After a brief prologue set in Amityville New York in 1976 -- during an investigation of that infamous haunting by professional ghostbusters Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) -- the Warrens finally get invited to Enfield. By that point things have gotten out of hand. Janet seems to be possessed by the spirit of Bill Wilkins who for unexplained reasons wants the Hodgsons out of ""his"" house threatening to kill them-- and the Warrens -- if they dont leave. Of course if youve seen the films trailers (or any of Wans ""Insidious"" films"") you already know that theres more going on here than a poltergeist infestation. One of Wans weaknesses is a predilection for demons that borders on religious obsession. To his mind one measly old ghost is never enough. Where ""The Conjuring 2"" goes off the rails a bit is in its insistence on dredging up a monstrous satanic entity -- in a nuns habit no less wearing deranged clown makeup that makes him look like Marcel Marceau on a murder spree -- to supplement the level of malevolence generated by Wilkins. Another shortcoming is the storys inability to clearly differentiate between the world of apparitions and our material one. What ghost for instance drops a set of real dentures? At the same time ""The Conjuring 2"" satisfies more than it disappoints. As Wans story swells to its inevitable almost operatic crescendo playfully balancing the hush of your own held breath with the kettle drum of your heart beating against your rib cage one thing becomes evident Youre not the audience for this symphony of terror; youre the instrument.

Theater Lagoon. Heres a heart-stirring documentary about Samantha Montgomery (Princess Shaw) a dirt poor but hugely talented Louisiana composer/vocalist with dreams of becoming a YouTube personality. Well as Israeli director Ido Haar demonstrates miracles happen. He approaches Princess Shaw to appear in his internet doc. What he knows and she doesnt is that producer Ophir Kutiel (known as Kutiman) has secretly sculpted her songs into superstar quality remixes and is about to host her global debut. There are moral questions about Haar and Kutiel keeping their secret from the main character through much of their documentary but the movie makes you appreciate how random acts of kindness can change lives. Its a millennial twist on ""American Idol"" with the subjects and filmmaker each using technology to produce something new and astounding. COLIN COVERT Dragon Inn [?][?][?]1/2 out of four stars Unrated In subtitled Mandarin. Theater Lagoon. What a hoot Director King Hus 1967 martial arts classic is back in a remastered 4K digital transfer that sends his acrobatic swordsmen pirouetting through the air in perfect form. Packed with action and wit it fills a wayside hotel in China with good guys on the run bad guys in pursuit and heroes set to save the day. Its full of wry oh-no-he-didnt moments of catching arrows inches before they strike playing switcheroo with cups of poisoned liquor and balletic combat. Hus a solid actors director amusing screenwriter and a craftsman of great visual invention. His crisp compositions and unfussy editing keep the whirling gyrating stunts from feeling like puppetry. And theres wonderful humor; a pretty young actress whose character pretends to be a boy manages to fool a whole lot of the royal courts secret police. Its a fabulous dream of a movie. You get the feeling that Quentin Tarantino drew a lot of the ""Kill Bill"" movies and ""The Hateful 8"" from this textbook; its clearly the goofy ancestor of Ang Lees ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" C.C. Dheepan [?][?][?]1/2 out of four stars Rated R for violence language and sexuality. Subtitled. Theater Uptown. The living the dying and the dead populate this superb French thriller balancing gang violence refugee plight and family drama. You never know where director Jacques Audiard will take you. Sometimes you may be shocked; other times delighted. A Sri Lankan man woman and 9-year-old girl pose as a family to flee its civil war with a deceased mans passport. In Paris they maintain their lie to avoid deportation. As the caretaker of a housing complex Dheepan (Antonythasan Jesuthasan) hopes to erase the scars of his military past. His pretend wife (Kalieaswari Srinivasan) finds work caretaking an elderly man whose apartment hosts commanders of the areas drug trade. When a turf war between rival mobs re-creates the chaos that chased them from their homeland Audiard tells the harrowing tale without a wasted shot or scene. The finale may recall the climax of ""Taxi Driver"" but the wonderfully reloaded postscript feels unlike anything else Its life going on. C.C. The Conjuring 2 [?][?] out of four stars Rated R for horror violence James Wans 2013 surprise haunted farmhouse hit ""The Conjuring"" reinvents that flat wheel with this unnecessary spinoff. Its a ramshackle ghost story that Stephen King would throw at his trash can. Further ""based on a true story"" demonology it again follows Amityville paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) -- working-class folk who know in their hearts that what you believe means more than what brainy science can prove. This time theyre sleuthing reported spooks in a London row house resembling a roach motel. Cue agony and special effects. As the most terrorized of four children Madison Wolfe gives her character a mix of skittish anxiety and pulp menace. Are the nightmares possessing her suited to psychological inquiry or the Warrens form of crucifix-waving voodoo Catholicism? It hardly matters as long as there are shadowy ghosts lunging in the dark squeaking doors and a dank basement as flooded as an Olympic pool. Those most likely to be rattled here are people who find endless jump scares monstrously boring. C.C. Time to Choose [?][?][?] out of four stars Rated Unrated but might be alarming to young children. Theater Lagoon. Which do you prefer hope or truth? Its a tough question when it comes to films about the environment. Al Gore went with hard facts in 2006s ""An Inconvenient Truth"" which tried to convert global-warming deniers. A decade later America remains divided. Perhaps thats why Charles Fergusons climate change documentary ""Time to Choose"" is so upbeat. The film tries to charm naysayers. Its talking heads include industry insiders -- solid capitalists who explain the long-term economic benefits of going green. Ferguson is nobodys fool He went for the jugular with ""Inside Job"" his Oscar-winning expose of the banking crisis. ""Time to Choose"" is an intelligent documentary from one of our most effective truth-tellers.

Director James Wan who helped kick off the torture-porn genre with the original ""Saw"" instead went for genuine scares real character development and the kind of creepy unease that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time waiting for something horrible to happen. (Note to non-horror fans That wait is a good thing.)RELATED Characters matter to Conjuring director James WanA sequel was inevitable and it has arrived. The good news is that ""The Conjuring 2"" is not simply a rehash of the first film. Following real-life case files of paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren (played by the returning Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) prevents that kind of sameness.In ""The Conjuring 2"" something is frightening (from left) Peggy (Frances OConnor) Janet (Madison Wolfe) and Margaret (Lauren Esposito). Perhaps its the posters of the Bay City Rollers and David Soul behind them? (Photo Warner Bros. Pictures) The bad news is that its not as good as the first.Few contemporary horror films are true. But with big success comes big expectations and ""The Conjuring 2"" is loaded with them. It doesnt live up to them quite but its still scary and worth seeing.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceIn a prologue set in a place most horror fans will recognize during a seance Lorraine sees an evil nun who frankly would seem more menacing if she didnt look like Marilyn Manson dressed for Halloween.

Strange things start to happen in her home particularly to Janet (Madison Wolfe) the second oldest. Its standard-issue scary movie stuff -- weird sounds toys turn on by themselves etc. It graduates to Janet levitating and speaking in the voice of an old man who says the house is his (she sees him from time to time).Things get bad enough that the church contacts the Warrens asking them to come out of retirement cross the Atlantic and at least observe to see if theres anything going on. So to the strains of the Clashs ""London Calling"" they do.Janet (Madison Wolfe) is terrorized in ""The Conjuring 2."" (Photo Matt Kennedy)But not without far too long a wait. Wan cuts back and forth across the ocean playing a waiting game as obvious and as frustrating as the one where you wait for the man and woman to get together after a series of false starts in a bad rom-com. Get on with it already.The use of the Clash is just one of Wans nods to pop culture outside the usual genre trappings. Theres more humor than in the first movie and at one point -- this is going to sound really stupid but it comes off better than that -- Ed grabs a guitar puts on his best Elvis sneer and sings ""Cant Help Falling in Love"" to the Hodgson kids.The interesting thing about this case is that its thoroughly documented -- and discredited by a lot of experts. Yet Wan and his team of screenwriters build that doubt into the film. The explanation is simple and efficient.Vera Farmiga plays Lorraine Warren in ""The Conjuring 2."" (Photo Matt Kennedy)Too bad the rest of the movie isnt.

(Ironically though he directed ""Furious 7"" his action scenes arent as well done.) The scares arent developed with the subtlety of the first movie but theyre still scary.

Richard Roeper richardroeper | email Sign-Up for Chicago Sun-Times Entertainment Newsletter Receive Theater Celebrity amp; Entertainment related Updates Sign-Up At one point deep into the slick and undeniably scary but annoyingly overstuffed ""The Conjuring 2"" Patrick Wilsons 1970s ghostbuster takes out an acoustic guitar that has been sitting untouched for years in the corner of a shabby London home tells a freaked-out mom and her scared-out-of-their-wits children to gather round -- and proceeds to channel Elvis singing ""I Cant Help Falling in Love With You."" No I really mean it. Its a tribute to director James Wans skill set and confidence that he puts the brakes on the story to give us this bizarre albeit strangely touching sequence --but by then I was so irritated by Wans choice to extend nearly every scene beyond its stretching point and to poke us and prod us with essentially the same handful of scare tactics again and again and AGAIN that I wanted to reach through the screen and smash that acoustic guitar a la John Belushi taking down Stephen Bishop in ""National Lampoons Animal House."" The unimaginatively titled ""The Conjuring 2"" is the follow-up to Wans razor-sharp supernatural thriller (it was called ""The Conjuring"" as you might have surmised). The 2013 original was a stylized and fictionalized version of the supposedly true-life harrowing exploits of husband-and-wife team Ed and Lorraine Warren (Wilson and Vera Farmiga both quite good) who claim some of the most well-documented cases ever of haunted houses demons possessed girls who wind up crawling on the ceiling and speaking in that classic Linda Blair ""Exorcist"" voice -- you know that sort of thing. ""The Conjuring"" was pretty cool because it fused cutting-edge camera moves and special effects with old-school horror in lieu of ""torture porn"" nonsense i.e. blood and guts squirting all over the screen as a substitute for genuine storytelling. Wan retains his touch for ratcheting up the tension providing doses of comic relief and then BOOM delivering another gotcha moment that will leave audiences jumping in their seats and then giggling at the visceral thrill ride -- but the scary moments arent as fresh this time around and with a running time of 2 hours 13 minutes ""The Conjuring 2"" is at least a half hour too long. At least. After an unnecessary prologue revisiting the ""Amityville Horror"" story (I still aint buying it) and a sequence set on a TV chat show where Ed loses his temper when a professional skeptic casts doubts on the Warrens work we finally get to the primary setting for the film a house in a working-class neighborhood in Enfield England. Divorced mom Peggy Hodgson (Frances OConnor) lives there with her four children who are suddenly being terrorized by slamming doors loud knocks creepy whispers toys that come to life in the middle of the night a seemingly empty rocking chair rocking a television with a mind of its own and a nasty old cuss of a spirit who occasionally takes possession of the body of 13-year-old Janet (Madison Wolfe). Wan is too smart and too aware of the genre not to have some fun with it. You know how theres always that moment when you want to yell at the family ""Get out of the house Run"" Well ""The Conjuring 2"" has big fun with that -- but then Hodgsons RETURN to the house more than once even though they know theres a world of torture and fright awaiting them. (The excuses offered for them returning are laughable.) Also unintentionally funny a skeptic who is convinced the family is faking it even though the film is one thousand percent slanted toward making it undeniably clear this is one seriously haunted house. In real life Id be siding with the skeptic in any of these tales of demons occupying dwellings and persons; in this movie anyone who doubts the presence of evil undead creatures spiriting about the hallways and occasionally occupying the bodies of living humans is an idiot. Farmiga has the showiest role in the film as Lorraine isnt just a demonologist; shes haunted by insanely realistic visions or dreams or whatever you want to call them and lets just say what Lorraine sees when shes in a trancelike state would make your worst nightmare look like a scene out of ""My Little Pony."" Lorraine is a mother of a young girl herself and Farmiga does an excellent job of portraying a skilled protective warrior against the dark side who occasionally is as scared as anyone else by what lurks in the dark. Wilson does strong and steady quite well. When hes not staving off demons with the help of the crucifix around his neck and his apparently photographic knowledge of biblical verses Ed is a loving and tender husband quite the guitarist/singer/Elvis impersonator -- and he even offers to fix a leak which has caused serious flooding in the Hodgsons basement. What a guy I admired the look of ""The Conjuring 2."" The sets are well-designed the lighting superb the cinematography suitably textured with creepy shadows and varying degrees of darkness offering just a hint of something wicked just behind that door or around that corner. Its just a shame the end of the movie wasnt lurking around the corner far sooner than when it finally turned up by which time a considerable amount of my emotional investment in the film had been exhausted. 1/2 New Line Cinema presents a film directed by James Wan and written by Wan Chad Hayes Carey W. Hayes and David Leslie Johnson. Running time 133 minutes. Rated R (for terror and horror violence). Opens Friday at local theaters.

As the Warrens try to save her little girl they become the demons next target. VPCVera Farmiga stars as Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring 2.(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)When theres something strange in your neighborhood who ya gonna call? Ed and Lorraine Warren obviously.Played again by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga the real-life 1970s ghostbusters head to the British Isles in the horror sequel The Conjuring 2 ( out of four; rated R; in theaters Friday). And after a trip to the action-film genre with Furious 7 director James Wan returns to the franchise with a freakier follow-up featuring creepy kids villains wholl keep you up at night and camerawork that puts moviegoers in a state of impending dread.The opening sequence revisits the infamous Amityville haunting in 1976 and after Lorraine encounters a demonic nun during a seance she proclaims ""This is the closest to hell as I ever want to get."" Well it gets worse for her and her spouse -- a year later and with Lorraine wanting to pull back from their paranormal activity theyre called to London to investigate why young 11-year-old Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe) suddenly has the voice of a 72-year-old dead guy.USA TODAYConjuring 2 stars a (self-) possessed Madison WolfeWan ingeniously utilizes snippets of the childrens ditty This Old Man in the background as struggling single mom Peggy Hodgson (Frances OConnor) and her young brood are driven mad by beds violently shaking at night weird shadows coming from the pop-heartthrob posters of yesteryear (one of the girls really digs David Soul) toy fire trucks randomly rolling down the hallway and the beat-up chair that seems to have a mind of its own.A good bit of dark humor is mined for laughs in these moments and Wan infuses some sweetness to break up the mood as well. There are some overly hokey elements -- Wilson strapping on a guitar to sing Elvis to some English children almost makes it seem like youre watching Blue Hawaii instead of a Conjuring movie. And at two-plus hours some of those lighter moments derail the tautness of the storytelling.There might be something seriously wrong with young Janet (Madison Wolfe) in The Conjuring 2. (Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Wolfe gives a great and eerie performance as the haunted kid whos either possessed or pulling a hoax. Its hard not to think of Linda Blair in The Exorcist when it comes to these kinds of roles but Wolfe does the pea-soup brigade proud.While Wilson is solid as the good-hearted Ed Farmiga is Wans true standout -- her Lorraine really gets put through the wringer as she deals with the constant presence of a terrifying supernatural force and Farmiga sells every gasp.Like other masters of horror -- your Stephen Kings and John Carpenters -- Wan wisely utilizes beloved things and turns them against his players. The aforementioned ghastly nun and a room full of crucifixes turning upside down attack characters faith and offer a visceral depiction of good vs. evil.USA TODAYThe true story behind The ConjuringAlso similar to what he did with the doll Annabelle in 2013s first Conjuring (and the toys 2014 spinoff movie) the filmmaker introduces an innocent-looking zoetrope which then spawns the Crooked Man. If that sinister sister doesnt give you the heebie-jeebies this wicked stringbean with a ghoulish maw of sharp chompers will.Wan leans into the real history of the 1977 Enfield poltergeist legend too though its not like he needs any extra inspiration for his fright fest -- when it comes to horror the man pulls no punches or screams. 350 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 11 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1tcJgYS",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/06/09/review-the-conjuring-2-movie/85611234/,200,theconjuring18,theconjuring,usatoday

Reprising their roles Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson star as Lorraine and Ed Warren who in one of their most terrifying paranormal investigations travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Nothing else in ""The Conjuring 2"" is as terrifying as the 1977-era floral wallpaper lining the hallways of its dimly lit and plainly haunted North London flat not to mention the fearsome edge on Patrick Wilsons sideburns. But despite being saddled with 20 minutes it doesnt need the movie is a consistently nerve-wracking sequel to the even better 2013 haunted-house thriller directed by James Wan (""Saw"" ""Insidious"" the forthcoming ""Aquaman""). He is a man who knows how to tee up a jump-scare.The first ""Conjuring"" introduced fictionalized versions of the real-life paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren played by Vera Farmiga and the aforementioned Wilson. The setting was a rural Rhode Island farmhouse in 1971 where the ghost of a long-dead witch made life difficult for the current residents. MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR""The Conjuring 2"" catches up with the ghost chasers six years later. Hot off a notorious case in Amityville N.Y. the Warrens travel to London at the Catholic Churchs behest to see if theres anything to the rumor of the already-infamous Enfield poltergeist. Punk rocks on the rise Margaret Thatchers on the telly and the working-class interiors are decorated in what might be called Brackish Domestic Hell. At first the exhausted but loving mother of four Peggy Hodgson (Frances OConnor) has no rational reason to believe her daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe) when she reports strange movements and apparitions in her bedroom. Then the evidence becomes difficult to ignore and the other children not to mention a couple of local police officers see for themselves chairs scooting across a kitchen floor; a backyard swing swinging on its own; and more demonically the specter of the houses former tenant (Bob Adrian) who died in the ratty old rocking chair in the living room corner. With stories like this the phrases ""living room"" and ""dying room"" are more or less interchangeable.There are other spooks and sources of terror of course. Long before coming to London Ed puts brush to canvas and paints a vision of a demon nun who later becomes manifest in various forms (the best image chalky-white demon fingers reaching out from behind the framed painting). Billy Hodgsons favorite toy a spinning ""Crooked Man"" zoetrope flashing images of a spindly-legged creep leaps off the tiny carousel wall and comes to life. The Enfield haunting becomes a wrestling match between the skeptics (Franka Potente of ""Run Lola Run"" plays parapsychologist Anita Gregory) and the believers (Simon McBurney looking like Inspector Doppler from ""Sleuth"" as paranormal expert Maurice Grosse).The script by Chad Hayes Carey W. Hayes David Leslie Johnson and director Wan packs a lot onto ""The Conjuring 2."" Its plainly too long and the story rhythm is somewhat odd taking time out for humanizing passages such as Wilsons Ed serenading the Hodgson clan with ""Cant Help Falling in Love"" on guitar and vocals. Wans film is at heart an uncynical embrace of family values. The marriage at the storys center is a hardy and loving one. As with the first ""Conjuring"" the horror R rating notwithstanding goes easy on the gore. Despite all the children in all that peril Wan is a humane sort of sadist.

Vera Farmiga returns as paranormal investigator Lorraine Warren in ""The Conjuring 2."" Photo Matt Kennedy TNS Conjuring 2 is a terrifyingly solid horror sequel 1 / 3 Back to Gallery ""The Conjuring 2"" is such a solid horror film you wont even think to pick it apart while its happening. Of course this family should have moved out the moment they realized their house was haunted. Certainly it makes more sense to sleep together in one spot like a pile of puppies instead of maintaining separate bedrooms. Hell yes someone should have thrown that haunted garage sale recliner in a Dumpster the moment it started rocking on its own. James Wan gets a pass on all of the above because he is a careful director who understands and respects his audience. Rules are followed patience is rewarded and the scares are earned in his movies. And most importantly the family being haunted in ""The Conjuring 2"" is filled with enough recognizable and subtle details that audience members will start to feel most terrifyingly what its like to be in their shoes. Its too early to call Wan the Steven Spielberg of mainstream horror films but hes starting to build that kind of resume. The 39-year-old directed or co-directed the groundbreaking ""Saw"" both ""Insidious"" movies and the superb and outstanding ""The Conjuring."" (He also directed the flawed 2007 ventriloquist dummy film ""Dead Silence"" -- his ""1941."") ""The Conjuring 2"" is a half step below its predecessor but its still better than any other mainstream horror film since ""It Follows."" The drama returns with ""The Conjuring"" exorcists Ed and Lorraine Warren the real-life paranormal investigators tied to ""The Amityville Horror."" The narrative makes brief reference to that case before relocating to London in 1977 where a new demonic possession has occurred. Wan and his co-writers take their time fleshing out the Hodgson family to the point where its easy to forget that scares are coming. Theres single mother Peggy (Frances OConnor) and four children bullied and living near poverty the nicest of which (Madison Wolfe) gradually becomes overtaken by a demonic presence. Its a completely preposterous situation happening onscreen but the narrative still makes perfect sense in its own fictional universe. This family is earnest and loving but also desperate frayed and vulnerable. If you were a demon the Hodgsons are exactly the type of family you might choose to terrorize. ""The Conjuring 2"" leans on more computer-generated scare building than ""The Conjuring"" but there is still an emphasis on practical effects. Use of shadows camera focus and sound design are as important as any creature that appears onscreen. And even as things go off-the-rails horrifying Wan always keeps one foot anchored in the humanity of the situation. The police response for example is wisely played for comedy. Bonding between the Hodgsons and Warrens occurs naturally with time for an impressive (and emotionally lifting) Elvis imitation by actor Patrick Wilson playing Ed. The look of the film is also perfect with the urban London attention to detail of a good musical biopic. (""I Started a Joke"" by the Bee Gees one of several deep cuts on the soundtrack is used to particularly good effect.) Production designer Julie Berghoff deserves special credit lovingly placing every David Soul poster and upside-down cross sometimes in the same room. ""The Conjuring 2"" feels about 20 minutes too long with one too many twists. The Warrens tween daughter is briefly introduced and then abruptly abandoned presumably being babysat by the demon already living in the professional ghost hunting familys stateside home. But the complaints are small and easy to ignore in ""The Conjuring 2."" And the rewards are plentiful. This isnt just a good horror film. Its a good film which just happens to fall in the horror genre. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet First the all-important question Is The Conjuring 2 scary? Like jump out of your seat watch through your outstretched fingers scary? The answer to that is ""yes."" Under James Wans direction even the most cliched haunted-house tropes (and this movie is bursting with them) are genuinely creepy and although the movie isnt overly reliant on jump scares the ones it does use--well they work. On a lizard-brain level The Conjuring 2 taps into the universal childhood fear of the dark and some of its simplest moments--like a little girl hiding under the covers with a flashlight--are its most effective bolstered by skillfully executed sound design and Don Burgess gloomy cinematography. Speaking of tropes thats where the ""based on a true story"" bit comes in. The main plot of the film revolves around a real-life incident known as the Enfield Poltergeist an extremely well-documented case of a supposed ghost who terrorized the Hodgson family of North London from 1977 to 1979 and was apparently a fan of the classics knocking on walls shaking beds throwing furniture and even the occasional haunted kids toy. And as malevolent spirits often do it picked on one of the children in particular 11-year-old Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe). Call it a collective delusion or a desperate cry for attention from a disturbed child. Or call it what the movie very explicitly calls it The Devil.With this installment the Conjuring movies may have overtaken The Exorcist as the most Christian of horror franchises taking place in a universe where the Catholic Church is the spiritual S.H.I.E.L.D. and demon hunters Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) its holy roller super-agents. The film opens with the Warrens investigating the famous Amityville case during the course of which Lorraine first encounters the hellish presence that will haunt her for the next few years. Fearing for his life she begs her husband to suspend any future paranormal investigations to which he reluctantly agrees. Until that is a priest arrives to give them their next mission Travel to London and confirm the veracity of reports of a demonically tinged haunting.Both Farmiga and Wilson are given their chance to shine in spooky set pieces--Farmiga early on in the film Wilson later. But while theyre both convincing in spiritual warrior mode Wans decision to play up the romance between the two doesnt quite work. We knew that the Warrens were a happily married couple in the first movie but having them each individually tell the story of their paranormal love and Ed make suggestive comments about the sleeping arrangements seems odd maybe because theyre flirting in front of a possessed pre-teen whose soul is currently in the process of being swallowed by the Pit. (On the other hand this is just another day at the office for the Warrens.)The non-horror elements of the film are uneven in general The score so effective in the fright scenes suddenly evokes eye rolls when things start to get sentimental and theres one scene of unintentional comedy where the films retro 70s setting--another element downplayed in the first film but foregrounded here--collides with its demonic imagery in an honestly pretty silly way. (The Conjuring 2 shares its predecessors eye for period details some of which seem out-and-out ridiculous until theyre juxtaposed with photos of their real-life counterparts in the end credits. The on-the-nose pop music gets no such redemption.) That being said there are also some truly funny moments like a shot of the Hodgson family running from their haunted house after a particularly intense bout of psychokinetic activity that riffs on smartasses favorite retort ""Why dont they just move?"" (And for the record they dont move because its public housing and the local council which is naturally quite skeptical of the whole ""ghost"" thing has to approve the relocation.)Its also worth noting that The Conjuring 2 is more than two hours long allowing for lots of escalation. And while each individual haunting scene can be white-knuckle intense by the dozenth or so such shock the film starts to lose momentum. So the final confrontation when it does come is a relief in more ways than one. The long running time also allows Wan to overthink his demonology The main villain an infernal nun is appropriately nightmarish if reminiscent of the veiled ""Bride In Black"" from Wans own Insidious. (See exhibit A and B.) Whats less compelling is the insertion of the ""Crooked Man"" a storybook scarecrow monster that starts spreading Babadook-esque chaos about halfway through and is explained as the demon assuming a form thats familiar to the Hodgsons. Which would be fine if it werent for the two familiar forms that the spirit has taken already.When The Conjuring 2 focuses its efforts on scaring the audience it succeeds wildly. And why wouldnt it? Wans got his horror technique locked down at this point. Its the parts where it wanders away from the basics of creating and releasing tension that prevent it from outdoing its predecessor.

Privacy Policy or Entering the canon of sequels that are better than the original ""The Conjuring 2"" exceeds the scope and scares of the surprise 70s-era horror hit from 2013. ""The Conjuring"" starring Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren reminded audiences of the power of a good ghost story and proved director James Wan to be a legitimate master of horror. The trio have returned to spook the pants off audiences again and the sequel is a perfectly executed retro haunting flick that dives deep below the surface to explore themes of vision belief and faith in what lies beyond the human realm.Like its predecessor ""The Conjuring 2"" is a bit of a bait and switch. While the first film teased us with the story of haunted doll Annabelle before diving into the haunting of the Perron family the sequel starts out with a taste of Amityville before hopping across the pond to take on the Enfield Poltergeist in England. Though Lorraine plagued by blasphemous visions of her husbands death wants to take time off from their work they are compelled by the church to verify the veracity of the claims that a vicious inhuman spirit has possessed young Janet Hodgson.Wan with veteran cinematographer Don Burgess shows a mastery over the camera as a storytelling tool and creates evocative bone-chilling suspense with just a simple pan or tilt. The camera is almost constantly moving maintaining a sense of unrest in the environment. It switches between handheld point-of-view shots from the perspective of the characters and an omniscient camera that seems to have a mind of its own weightlessly sweeping through rooms and drifting up into corners with a spectral presence. As a director Wan activates the audiences mode of looking and teaches us to fear what lies just outside the boundaries of the frame. The big scary thing is often hiding in plain sight.In laying bare the process of sight Wan mirrors the interlocked and sometimes contradictory themes of vision and belief in ""The Conjuring 2."" For the characters in the film seeing is believing when it comes to whats happening in the Hodgson home. But visual evidence is complicated in the film; its never quite trustworthy despite the reams of video and audiotape of Janets possession. Its easier to trust Lorraines psychic visions of otherworldly forces. Belief in the unseen and faith in each other is the bedrock of Ed and Lorraines relationship which is the moral compass of the story.This film is the bigger badder version of ""The Conjuring."" Wan fresh off directing ""Furious 7"" occasionally strays toward CGI-enhanced bombast to elicit scares rather than his subtle and effective camera work. Those animated boogeymen just arent as terrifying as the things we know are there but cant quite see.If anything ""The Conjuring 2"" plays as a spiritual sequel to ""The Exorcist"" with Madison Wolfe stepping into the Linda Blair role as the vulnerable Janet Hodgson. Set in the same time period there are similar sociopolitical anxieties about class family and motherhood swirling around the Hodgson familys supernatural plight. Its easy to reference the classics but ""The Conjuring 2"" is an evolved modern version of this story and establishes its own classic status as film in conversation with both the past and future of horror.THE CONJURING 23.5 out of 4 starsCast Vera Farmiga Patrick Wilson Madison Wolfe Frances OConnor Simon McBurney Maria Doyle Kennedy Franka PotenteDirected by James WanRunning time 2 hours 13 minutesRated R for terror and horror violence.(c)2016 Tribune Content Agency LLCDistributed by Tribune Content Agency LLC.

You know like adolescent girls. The fact that the two often seem to share houses is a coincidence that has intrigued psychic researchers and inspired skeptics for years. And of course now helps create ""The Conjuring 2."" ""Based on a true story"" - i.e. an alleged 1970s haunting beloved chiefly by the British tabloids - the movie is a sequel that brings back real-life occult researchers Ed and Lorraine Warren. MORE When Hollywood did the Devils work Once again theyre deeply Catholic ghostbusters who see the Devils hand everywhere. Once again theyre played with quiet righteous conviction by New Jerseys Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. After a brief detour to Amityville - apparently the Warrens did a drive-by seance there too - this new chapter from their casebook takes them to England where a working-class familys home has been turned almost literally upside down. At first you see the single mom - played with intense weariness by Frances OConnor - thought it was just her four children acting up. But when two of them started levitating she called the police. And when the constables saw things moving too they called the priests. Who in turn called in Ed and Lorraine. ""The Conjuring"" with its straightforward mix of religious heroes and scary monsters was an unexpected hit in 2013 (it remains the second-biggest original horror movie - right behind ""The Exorcist"" which set the modern faith-and-fear template). So its not surprising that this sequel would come along copying what made the original so successful. But that film was itself a copy with director James Wan merely resuscitating a lot of familiar boogeymen and reviving a bunch of dusty cliches - apparitions with mottled skin possessed people speaking in creaky voices oddly spooky antique toys suddenly slamming doors. All that is repeated here. Oh the first movie stole mostly from ""Poltergeist""; this one prefers ""The Exorcist."" But theres nothing very new outside of a rather shameless interpretation of ""true story"" (many of the incidents in this movie were highly questioned at the time and the most dramatic scenes here never happened at all). And what is new in the sequel feels a little self-indulgent. Like giving Broadway-star Wilson the chance to croon an Elvis Presley song. Or writing in a whole subplot about Lorraines battle with a demonic nun. Or further aggrandizing the decidedly controversial Warrens. Or stretching things way past two hours. A truly epic ghost story could sustain that. And truly intelligent filmmakers would ask themselves why at moments of cultural upheaval in this country horror movies tend toward the religious (the first wave of heaven-and-hell horror movies lasted from ""Rosemarys Baby"" in 1968 to ""The Omen"" in 1976). And then explore that idea. But the hackneyed script never moves beyond a lot of props flying around a very cramped dark set and Wans direction largely consists of simple horror-movie triple-plays - an odd noise a long silent pause while a character investigates and then a sudden startling scare. ""The Conjuring 2"" it seems is itself possessed - by the ghosts of other better movies. And that leaves audiences really looking for something fresh to be afraid without a ghost of a chance.

The Warrens investigate new and deadlier paranormal events. Director James Wan (Running Time 214) R Terror and horror violence. Area theaters. Just when sequels are threatening to scare everyone away from the movie theaters here comes one thats deliberately scary -- in a good way. Normally we might be waiting until October to get a few good scares but ""The Conjuring"" was such a hot movie during the summer of 2013 it makes sense to bring out its sequel just as things are getting warm. This time director James Wan now master of three lower budget horror franchises has upped the ante for the return of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. Vera Farmiga has reason to be scared in The Conjuring 2. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Six years after the events of the first movie the sequel opens with the Warrens trying to exorcise an infamous house in Amityville Long Island where Lorraine the medium of the duo is deeply scarred by something she sees there. A few years later they draw an even spookier case the Hodgson family in the Enfield part of London are being terrorized by the spirit of an old man that used to live in the house before them. Who knows how much of what we see actually comes from the ""true story"" of the Enfield ghost on which this is based? (There are existing tapes and photos from the case shown during the end credits that make the film feel more authentic.) Before that we witness the Hodgsons torment at the hands of a spook that mostly goes after their youngest daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe). Local police and others are called in to see Janets possession before the Warrens are called in by the Church to verify if the familys claims are real. Madison Wolfe shows tremendous self-possession as a demon-plagued kid. (Matt Kennedy/Matt Kennedy) By this point Wan has become an expert in all things spooky and hes clearly upped his game and the ante knowing exactly what he needs to do to keep the audience on edge. Some scenes build like a cleverly crafted magic trick as Wan finds new ways of keeping the audience absolutely terrified which will make it even harder for other horror filmmakers to keep pace. Wans secret weapons are clearly Wilson and Farmiga both such good actors theyre able to sell the audience on everything the Warrens experience. The duo also does a great job selling the romantic bond between the Warrens which helps you fall in love with them as much as you end up falling for the entire Hodgson family. Wolfe does an excellent job channeling one Linda Blair in her own self-possessed role. So Good Theyre Scary Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson take their roles seriously. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Although the two-hour-plus running time might seem daunting the time flies as things get more and more intense with some of the best bits being clever twists on tropes weve seen frequently. As with the first movie theres also much fun to be had from the movies mid-70s setting thereby removing most of the hi-tech gizmos that have become horror fodder in recent years. Horror fans sick of all the imitators (and sequels) have nothing to worry about here because the ghost busters of ""The Conjuring 2"" are scary good.

Courtesy Warner Bros. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Back in 2013 James Wans The Conjuring represented the high point of a wave of mainstream horror that showed there was still value in old-school scares -- that there was life beyond torture porn and slick slasher reboots. It was a ghost story-turned-possession thriller that mined terror out of the most basic of elements a young girl staring in fear at a dark corner of her room or a childrens hide-and-seek-type game gone horribly wrong. In other hands those scenarios might have remained cliches How many times have we vowed never to look into that closet again or not to go down those basement stairs or to toss out that creepy doll? But Wan found horror in simplicity. And for him style atmosphere and emotion werent exploitative devices; he invested them with meaning. His camera stalked his characters like an obsessed presence and he found pathos in the spectacle of a loving mothers transformation into a murderous demon.It is hard to believe that The Conjuring 2 was made by the same man. The streamlined elements of the first have now given way to mind-numbing clutter. If before Wan stripped down each set piece to its essentials -- a roving camera a patch of darkness a fearful face paralyzing silence -- now he has thuds and booms and shadows and shaking furniture and screaming characters all competing for our attention. Those once-purposeful relentless camera moves now just play as meaningless flash and not even well-executed flash. Wan is coming off the world-conquering success of his wildly entertaining automotive action sequel Furious Seven and he sometimes seems to be trying to bring the splashy cacophony of that movie into a world that thrives on sparseness and focus. It doesnt work.The first film had hinted that the next mission taken on by Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) the real-life demonologists whose cases have inspired the series would be the infamous Amityville haunting. The Conjuring 2 does kick off in the Long Island town with a messy violent and not particularly scary sequence of psychic Lorraine inhabiting the memories of a young man who killed his entire family. But it moves on instead to a similar haunting in Enfield England (also the filmmakers insist inspired by real events) where single impoverished mother Peggy Hodgson (Frances OConnor) and her four kids are contending with possessed rocking chairs creaking swings eerie tents and a zoetrope come to life. I wont reveal too many details but to say that it appears that the ghost of a creepy old man is lurking about insisting that the house is his.Throughout the Hodgson familys ordeal Wan cuts repeatedly to the Warrens back in the States. We know they will eventually take on the case but the film spends a comically long time getting to that inevitable development. Lorraine has had visions of Ed suffering a violent death and the Warrens shaken have sworn off this kind of work. But our devout heroes cant resist the call of a working-class family in need. When they finally make it to England they find something of a media circus already developing around the Hodgsons including a smug nay-saying parapsychologist (Franka Potente) determined to prove its all a hoax (boo hiss nonbelievers) and a celebrity paranormal specialist (Simon McBurney) intent on finding life after death for personal reasons.Horror -- or good horror at least -- has to walk a fine line between variation and consistency. Too much of the same type of scare leads to tedium. But too many different kinds of attempts to shock of the see-what-sticks variety can also dissipate the mood and defuse tension two elements critical to the genre. The Conjuring 2 somehow manages to be both repetitive and incoherent. It returns to the same setups over and over again with diminishing returns. Yet it also throws such a variety of scares at us -- moving furniture and faces in the dark and thudding walls and whispering ghosts often all in the same scene -- that the shocks dont build but rather cancel each other out.I worried at first that Wan was trying too hard but then I wondered whether he was trying at all. A minor but telling example When the story first jumps to England we get a nauseatingly de rigueur blast of The Clashs ""London Calling"" which suggests that the director has either never seen another film that cuts to the U.K. or has seen too many of them and believes this music cue is an ironclad rule of filmmaking.Still there are some strong moments. Wilson brings a corny credulous confidence to the part of Ed Warren and a scene where he sings an Elvis song to cheer up the Hodgsons has a goofy touching charm. But even some of the good stuff -- an effectively lean sequence here a convincing emotion there -- mostly remind us of how much better the first film was. If The Conjuring pointed the way toward a simpler smarter type of studio horror The Conjuring 2 feels like it has completely lost its way.

(And lets just forget ""Annabelle"" ever happened shall we?) Focusing on the mutually supportive relationship between ghost chasers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) ""The Conjuring 2"" is as interested in the power of love and marriage as it is in furniture smashing itself against the wall and levitating children speaking with the voices of craggy old dead men. See Video The Conjuring 2 First Trailer Is Creepy and Disturbing as Hell Once again the Warrens just cant keep out of creepy basements; a pre-credits sequence finds them investigating the haunted Lutz home in Amityville New York the 1970s haunting that real or not made the couple famous. During a seance Lorraine steps into the shoes of the man who murdered his family there before encountering a horrifying nun one whose ghastly pallor suggests Sister Marilyn Manson. Returning to her own body Lorraine gasps ""This is as close to hell as I ever want to get"" not a smart thing to say before the titles have even come up. Besides seeing the twisted sister Lorraine also had a vision of Eds death making her want to give up the demon-busting business. Her dreams of retirement are shattered just a year or so later when young Janet Hodgson (Madison Wolfe ""Joy"") starts teleporting through the floor of her home in Enfield a working-class borough of London. Creepy toys start coming to life weird noises come out of the walls and its more than single mum Peggy (Frances OConnor ""The Missing"") can handle. Also Read Bates Motels Vera Farmiga on Physically Demanding Combat Scenes and 6 Other Emmy Contender Quickies The Hodgsons have gone to the media before going to the Warrens which means our heroes have to contend with the attentions of fellow paranormal experts -- some dubious and others credulous. And while a council flat in Enfield certainly wouldnt be Edgar Allen Poes idea of a haunted mansion returning production designer Julie Burghoff provides plenty of unsettling dark corners plus a level of damp draft and rot that we rarely see when Hollywood shows British homes. (Burghoff and her team also do a great job of capturing 1977 interior design choices from the posters of David Soul and ""New Avengers""- era Joanna Lumley in the Hodgson girls room -- matching the photos of the real thing that run under the closing credits -- to the then-ubiquitous Will amp; Ariel Durant ""The Story of Civilization"" collection on the Warrens bookshelf.) Director James Wan perhaps mixing things up after ""Furious 7"" takes a measured approach here -- there are a lot fewer jump scares than there were in the first ""Conjuring"" but he and the four credited screenwriters do at least play with the requisite haunted-house playbook here with some interesting misdirects and an undercurrent of unease that escalates so very subtly. Also Read Insidious Chapter 4 Lands Director 2017 Release Date In the first two ""Insidious"" films Wan gave actresses like Rose Byrne and Lin Shaye a platform to play steely multi-faceted characters and ""The Conjuring 2"" provides similar opportunities to Farmiga and OConnor; even when theyre rightly scared out of their wits neither is a shrinking violet and both are bound and determined to protect their families. (One might question what happens to the Warrens teenage daughter when her parents traipse off to England to chase ghosts over Christmas but perhaps shes spending the holidays with friends in a non-haunted house.) Wilson finds the witty undertones in what could have been a hopelessly square-jawed hero and its fun to see character actors like Simon McBurney (""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"") Franka Potente (""Run Lola Run"") and Maria Doyle Kennedy (""Sing Street"") in full-on 1970s wigs and lapels. Audiences expecting a repeat fright-fest might be disappointed in the relative restraint of ""The Conjuring 2"" but this sequel -- lesser but not entirely unequal -- has its own goosebumps to raise.

Now Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmigas husband-and-wife paranormal sleuths Ed and Lorraine Warren have dipped back into their cobweb-festooned case files and emerged with The Conjuring 2--a come-down that proves the time-honored law of diminishing returns. At least 30 minutes too long the first half of the film cuts back and forth between the Warrens who are wrestling with the spiritual toll that all of their faith-based ghostbusting has taken on them and the Hodgson family in North London whose ramshackle home is possessed by a specter that takes the form of both a wheezy old codger with grimy dentures and a kabuki-faced wraith in a nuns habit. Testing the audiences patience Wan and his writing team spin their wheels for more than an hour just building up to the Warrens arrival in England in 1977. Unfortunately the setting is first introduced by The Clashs ""London Calling"" which didnt come out until 1979. Anachronisms aside when the couple gets there they find a reheated buffet of Exorcist cliches furniture that moves of its own accord crucifixes that wont stay rightside up and an innocent 11-year-old girl (Madison Wolfe) speaking in a demonic Linda Blair voice. There are some solid scares (Wan is too gifted in the dark art of gotcha manipulation to not make you leap a few times) but theres nothing on par with the first films brilliant hide-and-clap scene with Lili Taylor. If theres going to be a Conjuring 3--and this movie is just decent enough to suggest there will be--our heroes should be a little choosier about which case they dust off next.

June 2 2016 | 1000AM PT James Wans sequel to The Conjuring is a rattletrap haunted-house demonic-possession movie made with scary style. James Wan the director of ""Saw"" and ""Insidious"" is a horror filmmaker of such screw-tightening skill that even when he makes a good old rattletrap haunted-house potboiler its easy to feel a glimmer of admiration for his talent just beneath your tingling spine. (Its his talent that makes the creaky conventions scary.) ""The Conjuring 2"" is set in 1977 two years after the ghostly rumblings that first placed Amityville on the map as the new world capital of paranormal obsession. Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) the real-life supernatural investigators who made their reputations on the Amityville case are back from Wans 2013 smash ""The Conjuring"" and this time theyre chasing down the lurid goings-on in a North London council flat that the film basically rolls out as the British version of the Amityville hell house. In ""The Conjuring 2"" Wan doesnt exactly rewrite the book on how to stage a spectral pulp shocker. Telling the story of Peggy Hodgson (Frances OConnor) a beleaguered single mother and her four children who are being menaced by undead spirits Wan digs into a standard playbook of spook-show gambits. There are punishingly loud door-knocker-from-hell poundings on the soundtrack. Theres an old gray dead-looking man who looms up just when youre sure hes not going to. And then of course theres that timeless old chestnut demonic possession a theme a great many moviegoers take deadly seriously though youd think that a lavish attempt to replay ""The Exorcist"" again 43 years later might start to seem a little old hat. Wan is banking on the idea that the hat is so old its new again -- that yesterdays hurtling furniture and levitating pre-teen girl and croaky electromagnetic devil voice can add up to todays retro freakout. It can but only if the audience is willing to revel in Wans repertoire of baroque terror and not worry that theyre basically watching a rerun. ""The Conjuring 2"" makes it easy to revel because Wan has a gift that most slam-bang horror directors today do not a sense of the audience -- of their rhythm and pulse of how to manipulate a moment so that hes practically controlling your breathing. His specialty is the tracking shot with the camera whooshing forward the way it did in ""The Shining"" only Wan in ""The Conjuring 2"" sends it rushing through creaky floorboard hallways and cramped bedrooms which are made to seem much larger because the images are so alive theyre almost vibrating. All that restless movement suggests a force outside the camera one the rooms themselves can barely contain. The visual energy of Wans filmmaking turns a homely 10 x 12 back bedroom into an abyss. (If he ever bottoms out as a filmmaker hed make a terrific real-estate broker.) Wan is also a wizard of timing and in ""The Conjuring 2"" he toys with the audience by throwing something routinely unsettling at us (like say a toy firetruck that starts to move on its own) then letting that omen of menace pass at which point the movie will simply pause stopping dead in its tracks. Its right there in the middle of that vacuum of quiet that our anxiety starts to rush in. In ""The Conjuring 2"" Wan also finds room for his favorite ghost-story fetish object the one that hes become a master of (especially in his best movie ""Insidious"") the face. The face thats staring through the window. Staring through the dark. The face thats coming to get you. Somewhere on his office wall James Wan must have tacked up a three-by-five card that reads ""All you need to make a hit horror film is one truly godawful face."" In ""The Conjuring 2"" hes got one and its a real rock star of a ghoul. Lorraine Warren first glimpses it in the films prologue set during a seance in the Amityville house Lorraines body -- or rather her spirit -- gets up from the table and wanders through the house where she sees a premonition of her husbands death and then she sees the really scary thing -- a nightmare nun with piercing raccoon eyes sunken into a face that opens into a bloody grimace of death. This she/he demon looks like Marilyn Manson posing for the worlds most blasphemous album cover. Its more than scary -- its crazy-creepy. This is not your fathers haunting. But the rest of the movie sort of is. In London the ghosts have staked their claim in a home in Enfield where they zero in on Peggys youngest daughter -- the toothy innocent Janet (Madison Wolfe). They tear off her bed covers turn a wall of crucifixes upside down and eventually start speaking right through her a la Regan MacNiel. Thats when the Warrens get called in. Since this is the post-Amityville 70s the haunting becomes a major London media story. Is it real or is it a hoax? Needless to say this is not the most suspenseful element of the movie. Patrick Wilson in jet-black hair and Elvis sideburns wearing a plaid tie beneath his sweater vest and Vera Farminga all woeful polite concern seem to be playing the worlds nicest ghost hunters and theres a reason for that The secret weapon of ""The Conjuring"" and now ""The Conjuring 2"" is that theyre evangelical horror movies. Wilson plays Ed like a homespun televangelist with Lorraine as his beaming-eyed partner in faith. A major hook of these films in an era when chain-store cashiers are barely allowed to say ""Merry Christmas"" is how explicitly Christian they are. All of this of course goes right back to ""The Exorcist"" a film in which a 12-year-old girls body becomes the battleground in a religious war and a movie whose most famous line (well okay maybe its second most famous line after ""Your mother sucks ... etc."") is ""The power of Christ compels you"" In ""The Conjuring 2"" some of this is soft-pedaled and made to seem almost generic. Thats why the characterization of the Warrens winds up being just a little bit bland. Ed wields a keepsake crucifix that hangs on his necklace but what the film implies without ever quite coming out and saying it is that the Warrens whole obsession with haunted houses is driven by their faith. And thats part of what powers the currents of dread and release. On one level ""The Conjuring 2"" is just a not-bad megaplex funhouse movie no more and no less but on another level it offers its potential fans a helping of reassurance to go along with the fear. If there are ghost demons out there then God must be out there as well. Audiences it was long ago proven will pay to see both. Film Review The Conjuring 2Reviewed at Warner Bros. New York June 1.

Their ""investigation"" consisted of more or less popping in unannounced one day for an afternoon. A great and scary movie Im sure--I liked the first one--but Im always amused by the Warren mystique. Reply cadavra says June 9 2016 at 343 pm Seriously? 133 minutes? Did Wan tell the editors ""Just leave everything in?"" Reply Ray says June 2 2016 at 852 pm If the movie is good fine but the Warren ghost buster hoax is so tired. Reply Daryle says June 2 2016 at 1139 am Appreciated this review. I loved the first ""Conjuring"" and expect to love this one as welll. There may be nothing explicitly new in either film but the fact is that James Wan is a master of scaring the ""crap"" out of you.

The answer could seriously affect your enjoyment of this old-school supernatural sequel. If its yes youre in for a fun night at the movies a smart convincingly creepy account of a real-life haunting. If its a no you may find this a far less comfortable experience a story of the exploitation - abuse even- of four young children by a group of shameless hucksters portrayed here as heroes. The Conjuring 2 knows which side its bread is buttered on. Theres barely a scintilla of doubt in this reworked chronicle of the Enfield haunting case that gripped London in the late 1970s. When Peggy Hodgson (Frances OConnor) and her four children begin experiencing strange phenomena in their suburban home - rattlings clatterings and old-man apparitions - they call on Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) self-styled paranormal experts from across the pond. Even they at first experience a moments pause but then youngest daughter Janet (Madison Wolfe) starts speaking in growls things start flying around the living room and before you can say Hollywood overkill Lorraines whipping out her Bible and yelling at the spirits to leave the poor mites alone. After Insidious and The Conjuring director James Wan has his method down. The scares are effective and the camerawork is superb all lurking long shots and short sharp shocks. Wan is fully aware of the austerity-era parallels in his story and the period detail is surprisingly authentic provided you can get past a few ropey gorblimey accents (notably OConnors). But theres little here we havent seen before and unless youre willing to suspend a whole lot of disbelief the God-bothering certainty of it all is pretty disconcerting. Theres a great conflicted drama to be made about the Enfield case; this isnt quite it.

There are plenty of jumpy moments and suspense-building scenes in this film made even creepier given the fact that it is based on a true story. If you are hoping for a deep and thrilling plot line you wont find it here. The characters are under developed with vague hints of depth to them which are disappointingly never followed up on. There are also moments when it might have been better not to see what was haunting them and leave it up to our imagination rather than the slightly comical apparitions. However there are plenty of scream-worthy moments which makes it worth a watch.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore10 days agoZoe FFeaturedI hadnt seen the first of The Conjuring films but this didnt seem to matter as the second of the films does refer back to gives an overview of as much as you need to know - there wasnt too much emphasis on the previous happenings. I had however watched a 3 part mini drama series last year on Sky Living called the Enfield Haunting which was also based on the true story of the haunting at the Hodgson family residence but the two delivered it in very different ways so Ill touch on both... For me The Conjuring 2 was very exaggerated and over the top but to be honest what youd expect from a movie of this kind. It a bit cliched in the way it relies on the same old scare tactics (overly theatrical music which then goes silent then something jumps out you know the drill) however admittedly did the job of have be jumping out of my skin more times than I could count which is the best thing I can say about this film. That said there were parts I found very cheesy and were it was just a bit too Hollywood particularly the portray of the America couple Ed and Lorraine Warren who were paranormal researchers on the case - this was just a bit overbearing for my liking and for lack of a better word were just CRINGE I also found it interesting as they were not represented in The Enfield Haunting at all and now having read up a little on the ""real story"" with the help of http//www.historyvshollywood.com only highlighted further how loosely based on the true story this film was as I understand that that the Warrens were hardly involved in the case had apparently showed up uninvited and only stayed for a day. Therefore I believe The Enfield Haunting stayed truer to life Maurice Grosse and Guy Lyon Playfair were far more focused on - whereas Maurice was almost a redundant character in the film who they only lightly touch upon the death of his daughter which seemed like a bit of a random afterthought on the script this was much better portrayed in the TV series and really gave his character more depth and Guy on the other hand well he didnt make it on to the big screen adaptation Though the TV series was slower paced and didnt play up to the horror anywhere near as much or fabricate the story to the same extent instead keeps it more realistic and just a bit creepy and eerie. On a side note I also feel the need to say I felt there was a casting issue with newcomer Lauren Esposito as Margaret Hodgson her North London accent wasnt nearly strong enough in comparison to the rest of the family (I have since found out shes Australian) and might just be me but I noticed a resemblance to Gigi Hadid which I found distracting If youre looking for out-and-out spine tingling horror youre likely to be disappointed as I felt it doesnt leave you with any real sense of fear its more just unsettling at times as it plays on suspense and thrills. If you manage your expectations then Id say its worth a watch.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore12 days agoGeorgeXTastemakerFeaturedIf you like horror movies you are going to love this. The exact dose of ghosts exorcismism creepy music and a crazy girl as the main character. Much better than previous Conjuring 1. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore13 days agoJKFeaturedStrong horror says the BBFC classification description for this film and some might say that the use of strong is perhaps a bit well strong. Wan can definitely turn on eerie dread and suspense in his audience at the drop of a hat with clever but by now fairly routine use of sound and camerawork. It makes for an entertaining 2 hours in a ghost train sort of way and I enjoyed it more than the first Conjuring film but as a film it has the emotional impact of a ghost train in other words next to none. The Conjuring 3 is clearly to be expected - more of the same?Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-conjuring-2,200,theconjuring31,theconjuring,timeout
