Almost every scene in Phat Girlz -- the fancy z is for Z-grade -- is about how shes fat. How fat is she? Her character Jazmins so fat that when she gets dressed on screen the soundtrack plays ""Brick House."" Shes so fat she eats at Fatassburger. Shes so fat that when she meets a hot rich doctor (Jimmy Jean-Louis) he has to be from Nigeria because -- did you know? -- only African guys like big girls. Jazmins so fat that the movie reduces her to a single discernible characteristic which is a telltale mark of many a wholly awful comedy.

Pic isnt likely to advance budding film career of top-billed MoNique a vet standup and sitcom performer whose sassy brassy shtick isnt nearly enough to support material this insubstantial. ""Phat Girlz"" is a thin comedy about a plus-size heroine who finds true love when she charms a courtly hunk fond of overweight ladies. Equal parts low-mileage star vehicle and heavy-handed fantasy fulfillment pic isnt likely to advance budding film career of top-billed MoNique a vet standup and sitcom performer whose sassy brassy shtick isnt nearly enough to support material this insubstantial. Judging from slim 3.1 million opening weekend gross ticket buyers arent biting. Homevid biz may be a bit meatier. While underemployed as a sales clerk at a snooty L.A. department store Jazmin Biltmore (MoNique) dreams of creating fashionable attire for herself and other hefty ladies. (Dont call her fat ""Im sexy-succulent"" she insists.) But her self-esteem is so low and her condescending boss (Jack Noseworthy) so obstructive that shes not able to show her design sketches to a powerful store exec (a smooth and sympathetic Eric Roberts). Life isnt much easier for Jazmin after work. When not wasting time and money on trendy diet plans shes chomping down cheeseburgers to deaden the pain of living in a world filled with skinny bimbos and insensitive men. When pressed too hard she snaps back with trash talk. (Pity the poor fast-food counterman who makes a rude remark about her size.) Throughout much of the day however shes mostly mopey. Vacationing at a Palm Springs resort with Stacey (Kendra C. Johnson) her slightly less full-figured buddy and Mia (Joyful Drake) her sexy-svelte cousin she meets Tunde (Jimmy Jean-Louis) a visiting Nigerian doctor whos sweet sensitive and attentive. Better still hes cut like a sculpture and looks hot in a skimpy swimsuit. (Its more than a little ironic that in a pic designed to celebrate ""phat girlz"" almost all of the men on view are buff studs.) ""Phat Girlz"" takes what feels like a very long time to develop the romance between Jazmin and Tunde quite possibly because writer-director Nnegest Likke has nothing else in her scenario to sustain audience interest. Pic feels torturously padded at an overlong 98 minutes. During a contrived (and rest assured temporary) separation of the lovers Jazmin goes through an emotional breakdown that somehow leaves her feeling more accepting of herself. This gives MoNique a welcome opportunity to show she can register emotions other than surly sarcastic or smitten. But the scene itself like so many others in pic simply goes on too long to steadily diminishing effect. Unattractive lensing and harsh lighting dont help.

"In Phat Girlz empowerment is entertaining - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies In Phat Girlz empowerment is entertaining By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  April 8 2006 When movie studios refuse to show films to the press before opening day it usually means they stink. In the case of Phat Girlz"" which wasnt screened for critics Im convinced its because the studio didnt see the movie.This is a disarming and in its own way delightful vehicle for its star and executive producer the comedian and actress MoNique. Who could hate this movie?Written and directed by Nnegest Likke in her debut its the sort of unvarnished personal journey picture that used to crop up back in the days of the true independent cinema movement of the early 1990s when black women were telling positive stories about themselves. This one has commercial packaging (lots of nightclub and poolside scenes and one hilarious round of You so ugly"" jokes) and some dubious shot-making. But the movie cuts through the frivolity and technical shortcomings and allows MoNique to cry out from her soul.She plays Jazmin an exuberant plus-size force of nature living in a taunting size-zero world. While her dreams of fashion-design success languish she works at a department store with her best friend Stacey (the outstanding Kendra C. Johnson). Stacey is dowdier and more reserved than her pal and overweight too and she easily gives in to the misery of being fat in Los Angeles a feeling Jazmin fights to ignore. Its not easy. She cant even order from a fast food joint without getting harassed by the attendant. But when she wins a trip to a chichi Palm Springs resort things start looking up.Jazmin Stacey and Mia Jazmins floozy of a cousin (played by Joyful Drake a bright comedic actress) check in and within minutes find themselves approached by a trio of Nigerian doctors at the hotel for a conference. These Africans two of whom are very handsome worship full-figured women. To them Jazmin and Stacey are sexy and prosperous and for a change hotter than Mia. But the attention is too hard to believe for Jazmin. She flees her doting suitor drags the girls home to LA and locks herself in her bedroom where she proceeds to hit bottom.Her private collapse feels like brutally real psychodrama. She attacks her svelte dressing mannequin. She tosses the TV set out the window. She shouts sweats and wails in obvious agony in a struggle to love herself. Susan Lucci has never done it better. And suddenly the movie has turned from a comedy into one of those inspirational mass-market confessionals.MoNiques raw self-exorcism in that sequence is not becoming of a movie star but its perfect for a spokeswoman. And Phat Girlz"" becomes a touching demand for the empowerment of a disenfranchised social class of women the big-boned or thick as Jazmin puts it. Fine the movie turns preachy but if were going to get a lecture it might as well be an entertaining one about a prejudice that hides in plain sight and shows no signs of going away. In the eyes of her tormentors Jazmin might be fat as hell but shes not going to take it anymore.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.
