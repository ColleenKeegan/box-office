"The Kind Words an emotionally rich family dramedy - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Kind Words an emotionally rich family dramedy ""The Kind Words"" Strand Releasing Rotem Zisman-Cohen from left Roy Assaf and Asaf Ben-Shimon in the movie ""The Kind Words."" Rotem Zisman-Cohen from left Roy Assaf and Asaf Ben-Shimon in the movie ""The Kind Words."" (Strand Releasing) Gary Goldstein I have only kind words for ""The Kind Words"" an emotionally rich beautifully textured family dramedy that touches on a wealth of interpersonal issues with buoyancy charm and grace. Its one of the best films so far this year.Writer-director Shemi Zarhin masterfully explores a haunting vital theme Why do we sometimes learn more about a parent in death than in life? For Jewish Israeli adult siblings Dorona (Rotem Zissman-Cohen) Netanel (Roy Assaf) and Shai (Assaf Ben-Shimon) this question takes on unexpected resonance when after the passing of their beloved mother Yona (Levana Finkelstein) they discover their actual father may be Yonas long-ago Algerian lover Maurice and not Michael (Sasson Gabai) the man who raised the trio as his own. The revelation sets the siblings on an engaging heartfelt at times amusing detective hunt that takes them from Jerusalem to Paris and then to Marseilles where they finally zero in on their possible biological dad (Maurice Benichou). Doronas devoted husband (Tsahi Halevi) Yonas touchy sister (Florence Bloch) and a lovely aging actress (Louise Portal) factor in as well.Credible complications ensue and although the story doesnt traffic in easy answers it offers a wise and unusually satisfying ending that for some here may also mark a new beginning. Perhaps most impressive though is how Zarhin and his fine appealing actors deftly capture the essence of a tight sibling bond that playfully blunt lovingly annoyed history-filled dynamic unique to growing up -- and to growing older -- together.  -------------The Kind WordsIn French and Hebrew with English subtitlesNot ratedRunning time 1 hour 58 minutes.Playing Laemmle Royal Theater West Los Angeles; Laemmle Town Center 5 Encino See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times HBOs new programming boss talks True Detectives fate pulling the plug on Vinyl and a hope for more diversity Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mini-kind-words-review-20160627-snap-story.html#nt=oft13a-4gp1,200,thewords0,thewords,latimes

Credit Strand Releasing In ""The Kind Words"" Dorona (Rotem Zisman -Cohen) has given up trying to become a mother after a series of miscarriages. Fertility mocks her at every turn. Her brother Natanel (Roy Assaf) has triplets and their little brother Shai (Assaf Ben-Shimon) has a child with a woman in Hungary although these days he dates men. Even their mother (Levana Finkelstein) looks pregnant with a huge tumor she manages to deny. And the way dances around her Jerusalem apartment singing along to a scratchy old LP you would never know that a delicate surgery lies ahead or that her husband has dumped her for a young pouty-lipped singer.The Israeli director Shemi Zarhin who also wrote the screenplay shuffles these modern problems into an enjoyably human mystery. The story takes flight when Dorona is summoned by her father who makes a surprising pronouncement and their mother who holds the answers has been stricken with a fatal blood clot. Video Trailer The Kind Words A preview of the film. By STRAND RELEASING on Publish Date June 4 2016. Photo by Strand Releasing. Watch in Times Video >> embed Mourning yet angry and confused Dorona and her brothers skitter off like Jerusalems sophisticated answer to the Scooby-Doo crew seeking the answers that their mother took to her grave. They travel to Paris for some family history from Aunt Rosa then to a faded film star who treats them to a tale of desperate love. Next its on to Marseille in search of a restaurant called Beirut.A harmonious ensemble of motion and proportion the siblings achieve a tender balance as their definitions of family identity and ethnicity are tested. Doronas husband tagging along seems superfluous.Humor creeps in from strange sources including a seller of funeral packages and a march through a Paris graveyard. And while not every motivation is clear subtext isnt everything in a movie as complex and satisfying as this one.

First slowly and then with increasing speed like a melancholy wind-up toy Shemi Zarhins film follows Dorona (Rotem Zissman-Cohen) an Israeli Jew and her two brothers as their life story unravels. Dorona feels stuck -- sad because she cant bear a child and dissociated from her husband. She goes to her mother for comfort in the wake of her parents separation and her mother tells her to grow up -- then dies. Film Details The Kind Words RatingNR GenreDrama Running Time118 min. More Info Next Her dad reveals that someone else must have been her biological father. At this point the film develops a sense of humor. Dorona and her brothers go to France in search of their mothers Algerian lover whom theyve just discovered. The chemistry between the siblings carries the film; they share a rich banter and subtle physical affection that feels real built on years of shared intimacy -- and this new experience of ignorance. EXPAND Their journey a tired slog in the sunshine up and down cobbled streets is silly with exhaustion animated with the sweet mania at the end of a long night. Zissman-Cohens subtle features and the way they flood with repressed feeling make each moment a separate fully formed shard in a disjointed mosaic of emotional truth. In Hebrew and in French between life and death the siblings reckon with a question that the film wants to be larger than it is If their real father is an Algerian Muslim who are they? The fact is theyre already grown and the most compelling questions are ordinary. Those questions are worth asking but the way to answer them is just by living -- which they do.The Kind Words Directed by Shemi Zarhin Strand Releasing Opens June 24 Lincoln Plaza Cinemas Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Diana Clarke Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.
