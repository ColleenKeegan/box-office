This is the moment where the once-promising American filmmaker finally ditches any pretence at being an indie outsider and clamps his lips firmly around the Hollywood teat. Jonah Hill (also slumming it) plays Noah a still-at-home mummys boy who takes a job as a babysitter to three eccentric overprivileged pre-teens. What follows is a screwball romp in the time honoured mid-80s Adventures in Babysitting mould the brats run wild Hill freaks out crooks get involved and everyone runs around yelling. The Sitter isnt awful - there are a few decent one-liners and a predictable but sweet subplot involving confused eldest kid Slater (Max Records) - but its more bad than good a noisy unfocused frequently annoying and intermittently offensive slapstick misfire.

Though the premise is re-heated (man-boy in over his head with evil psychotic children) and the outcome largely predictable (everyone dies) the execution of the film is solid. There are jokes these jokes make you laugh and in going brutally dark early and often The Sitter manages to bring some authenticity to the enterprise. Its a laudable thing because the temptation had to have been to bail out of the rougher ""kids in peril"" comedy and end up with some terrible amalgamation of Kindergarten Cop meets Daddy Day Care. The Sitter does not do that. It features gangster rap and people getting shot; it does not care for your soft comedy. Jonah Hill is a dropout who relies on his momma for sustenance. Hes hanging out on the couch watching some tele blending in when a babysitting gig is presented to him in the form of ""you should REALLY do this."" He does but in the meantime a young lady who is taking advantage of their relationship asks him to pick up some cocaine for them to partake in. So there he is watching three youngsters in desperate need of the nose candy with Slick Rick booming in the background. Its Superbad meets Kick-Ass though those are superior films. Still not a bad pedigree. Far funnier than Your Highness The Sitter feels like an evolution of the talent director David Gordon Green momentarily flashed in Pineapple Express. The three children Hill has been tasked with safeguarding are all blissfully demented. Max Records whom youll recall from Where the Wild Things Are is hooked on prescription meds and wound tighter than a fighter pilot from Top Gun drinking Red Bull. Landry Bender is the kid sister who uses too much makeup and aspires to be Paris Hilton. Kevin Hernandez is a preteen who enjoys homemade explosives which is just as festive as it sounds. All three of the younger actors have nice moments and exhibit decent comic timing. But its during the random moments The Sitter truly excels. Goofball comedy at its finest where no one learns and no one grows drug dealer Karl (Sam Rockwell) provides both a backdrop and characterization thats rarely seen in a film with even a moderate production budget. Jonah Hill continues his streak of steady performances which brings us to our question and answer portion of the review. Whens the last time Jonah Hill was in a bad film? Evan Almighty back in ought-7? Regardless of your personal Jonah Hill theorems his efforts as Noah Griffith the dorky and unemployed ""put upon"" man largely work. Other than about 15 minutes The Sitter features respectable laughs. So what keeps The Sitter from ""cant-miss"" superstardom? The narrative trope that it all must ""mean something."" Its as if the script decided to play a round of golf with a pool cue and then upon taking the lead went back to using the five-iron instead of sustaining the momentum. Strange. Still the idea that were talking about the relative merits of The Sitter has to count as a win given the dearth of available comedy in theaters. That factor paired with the films modest ambition makes this a worthy Friday night offering. Which is more than you could say for most babysitting jobs.

But ""The Sitter"" wants to have its urinal cake and eat it too pushing the envelope of taste one minute and then delivering maudlin little life lessons the next. Jonah Hill --this was apparently filmed back in his zaftig period -- stars as Noah a jobless 20-something college dropout who thinks that Marisa (Ari Graynor) is his girlfriend even though shes clearly using him as her lackey and occasional provider of oral pleasure. As a favor to his mom Noah takes a job babysitting neighbor kids Slater (Max Records of ""Where the Wild Things Are) a teen neurotic; Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) an adopted Salvadoran with a proclivity for indoor pyrotechnics; and Blithe (Landry Bender) a nine-year-old who aspires to be a celebutante. When Marisa promises sexual reciprocation in exchange for Noah buying her coke from unhinged dealer Karl (Sam Rockwell) and bringing it to a loft party in Brooklyn Noah drags his young charges through the streets of New York in an attempt to deliver his cargo while eluding a newly-angered Karl who wants 10000 for the package that Rodrigo accidentally stole from his bathroom. If all of this sounds like a shameless rip-off of 1987s ""Adventures in Babysitting"" well -- yes. Yes it is. And while ""Babysitting"" was always a decidedly second-tier teen comedy of the 1980s it looks like a masterpiece of John Hughes-ian proportions next to the charmless and tacky ""The Sitter."" First-time screenwriters Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka obviously set out to give the material an R-rated spin loading the film with sexual debauchery drugs and foul-mouthed children. But either they or the studio or director David Gordon Green apparently had a failure of nerve; Noah for example starts out aggressively unlikable but winds up being a misunderstood guy whos had some bad breaks. The film also totally hedges its bets by attempting to be shocking (although never alas very funny) but then immediately back-pedaling. Were meant to be amused by the musclemen in Speedos surrounding Karl -- like Rockwell hadnt already given us enough stale gay stereotypes in ""Gentlemen Broncos"" -- but then theres a moment that shoots for poignancy when Noah gives an ""it gets better"" booster speech to a confused and closeted youth. Then there are the offensive African-American stereotypes which the movie thinks it can leaven by giving us both a nice black girl as a potential love interest for Noah as well as some third-act ""magical Negroes"" who come to Noahs rescue. Not that ""The Sitter"" succeeds at being either a shocking comedy or a heartwarming character study but it most definitely fails at trying to mash the two things together. Thats a real shame considering that Green started his career as the filmmaker behind acclaimed indies like ""George Washington"" and ""All the Real Girls"" with that early promise spilling into his major-studio debut ""Pineapple Express"" a surprisingly daring comedy that pushed bro-mantic boundaries and kept the laughs coming even amidst serious violence. In 2011 however Green flopped with the staggeringly unfunny ""Your Highness"" and now with ""The Sitter"" an 81-minute comedy that feels twice as long as ""J. Edgar"" and only half as funny. Dont waste those 4860 seconds on this wretched fiasco. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Sitter The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sitter-the ) Sitter The (United States 2011) December 10 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Sitter fits neatly into the mediocre generic comedy category - a classification reserved for films that are neither funny enough nor raunchy enough nor smart enough to do more than consume time and dull the senses. One could argue that these are among the most difficult movies to watch because although not incompetently made their entertainment value is minimal - they cant even be enjoyed in a ""so bad theyre good"" sense. An optimist can find things to like about them but the bright spots are overwhelmed by the drudgery of the whole. For every laugh offered by The Sitter there are five minutes of boredom and at least one failed scene of would-be ""dramatic"" character building. The template is similar to one employed by many 80s and 90s comedies most of which are long forgotten - as this one will soon be. The Sitter is sort of an Adventures in Babysitting with a potty mouth. Surprisingly in an era when each new R-rated comedy tries to outdo its predecessors in its debauched celebration of bad behavior this one is tame. Theres plenty of raunchy talk but no nudity and not a lot of sex. Its almost as if this was designed to be a PG-13 movie and someone decided at the last moment to throw in a gratuitous oral sex scene and a bunch of F-bombs to make it a more ""adult"" endeavor. Noah (Jonah Hill) is a generally likeable guy who lacks drive and ambition. He performs cunnilingus on his ""girlfriend"" Marisa (Ari Graynor) in the hope that shell return the favor. When she doesnt he sits on the couch and vegetates in front of the TV. In order to make a little money and help out his mother he agrees to babysit for three kids the soulful loner Slater (Max Records); the precocious princess Blithe (Landry Bender); and the recently adopted Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) whose love of fireworks makes him a walking fire hazard. Everything seems to be going fine - or as fine as it can be with an explosives-lover on the premesis - until Noah gets a call from Marisa. Shes horny and wants to have sex with him if he can get himself to her location asap. She also demands that he pay a visit to her drug dealer friend Karl (Sam Rockwell) to pick up some coke. Unwilling to pass up this opportunity to advance his relationship with Marisa Noah bundles his charges into the family minivan and heads off on a night of predictable misadventures. For the most part The Sitter feels tired and recycled. The strangest (and therefore most interesting) segment occurs when Noah enters Karls bizzaro compound where about a dozen bare-chested muscle-bound heavies are pumping iron to the tune of ""Escape (The Pina Colada Song)."" This is the kind of weirdness that had there been a lot more of it would have made The Sitter worth sitting through. As it is its 80 minutes of mostly generic Murphys Law crap although it seems a lot longer than the skinny running time would suggest. In all fairness Jonah Hills performance exhibits nuances one doesnt expect from this kind of character in this sort of movie. Noahs actions are weighed down by loneliness and regret. Theres something sad and believable in the way he allows himself to be used by Marisa - its obvious to everyone but him that shes interested only in what she can get from him. Theres no relationship there but Noah becomes putty in her hand when she calls him her ""boyfriend."" Hills portrayal of the character brings out these elements although that may be part of the reason why a lot of the humor doesnt click - its not much fun to see a pitiable basically good guy put through the ringer like this. On the other hand Sam Rockwell is a hoot. His bipolar Karl is reminiscent of the Timothy Olyphant character in The Girl Next Door - friendly one moment murderous the next. The kids are generic movie kids capable only of the minimal range required from them by the script. For director David Gordon Green the indie filmmaker who made his mark with small productions like George Washington and All the Real Girls this represents his second disappointing mainstream comedy following in the wake of Your Highness. At times one can almost sense a more interesting movie trying to emerge from The Sitter but it is smothered by unfunny jokes clichA(c)d drama and a formulaic narrative. Wherever Greens strengths may lie his last two efforts indicate they are not in the multiplex-bound comedy field.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An irresponsible slacker agrees to baby-sit three problem children. BOTTOM LINE A raunchy and passably funny romp but the glib racism spoils the fun. CAST Jonah Hill Ari Graynor Sam Rockwell LENGTH 121 Theres a fine line between going retro and simply moving backward and ""The Sitter"" is teetering right on it. Starring Jonah Hill in a return to raunchy comedy ""The Sitter"" is director David Gordon Greens tribute to 1980s romps like ""Adventures in Babysitting"" and ""After Hours."" Unfortunately its also a revival of racial stereotypes that belong to the past. Not that the film doesnt have moments. Hill following his impressive dramatic turn in ""Moneyball"" is back in form as the slacker-misfit Noah Griffith who takes a baby-sitting job to mollify his exasperated mother (Jessica Hecht). The kids make for a colorful bunch Thirteen-year-old Slater (Max Records ""The Brothers Bloom"") pops pills for anxiety; Blithe (Landry Bender) is an oversexed kindergartner (""Is there bottle service here?"" she asks at a bat mitzvah); glowering adoptee Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) appears to have been raised by a Salvadoran drug cartel. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Speaking of drugs Noah tries to impress his girlfriend Marisa (Ari Graynor) by visiting violent coke dealer Karl (Sam Rockwell). Unwisely Noah brings the kids. Rodrigo steals enough powder to pulverize Tony Montana launching a series of misadventures involving a stolen minivan corrupt cops and a trove of diamonds. Throughout the long night Noah also forms an unlikely rapport with his troubled young charges. ""The Sitter"" seems to have a good heart so why all the glib racism? Rodrigo is no less a walking ethnic joke than the Asian exchange student in John Hughes ""Sixteen Candles"" and there are way too many scenes of angry black people turning all smiles at Hills jive talk. The interracial romance between Noah and Roxanne (Kylie Bunbury) feels like a weak show of enlightenment. Though occasionally funny and even charming ""The Sitter"" is ultimately a throwback in more ways than one. PLOT An irresponsible slacker agrees to baby-sit three problem children.

Slightly crushed Noah shrugs it off--which would be easy enough to do with this movie too if not for Hills appealing combination of self-deprecation charm and perverse big-brotherly guidance and affection.Directed by David Gordon Green--who transitioned from gooey personal indies (George Washington All the Real Girls) to studio-backed comedies by making a stop in Apatown (where Hill has been a longtime resident) with 2008s Pineapple Express--The Sitter was written by first-timers Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka. The plot a hard-R riff on 80s standbys like Adventures in Babysitting is set in motion when Noah reluctantly agrees to mind three neighborhood squirts so his lonely-divorcee mother can go on a date. His charges include Slater (Max Records) a 13-year-old basket (and closet) case who totes his anti-anxiety meds in a fanny pack; the pill poppers celebutante-besotted little sister Blithe (Landry Bender); and their adopted brother from El Salvador Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) a cherry bomb-detonating sociopath and total parodic misfire. A call from Marisa at a party in Williamsburg with the promise of sex if Noah brings her coke means the kids will be strapped into the mini-van and constantly imperiled by Sam Rockwells drug kingpin and crew who all look like extras from Cruising.Breaking through the uninspired setup are several great scenes of Noah getting his comeuppance (belatedly by a former high-school classmate still furious about the time he puked in the urn holding her grandmothers ashes) confronting his deadbeat dad readily ticking off his own multiple failures gently advising the tykes (in between endangering their lives) and proving irresistible to the fox who sat behind him in astronomy class. Unlike most of the man-boy comedies from the past five years nearly all affiliated in some way with Apatow--formulaic mixtures of raunch treacle and gynophobia--The Sitter features a protagonist neither too repellent from the outset nor too self-congratulatory at the conclusion. Hill plays Noah with just the right amount of self-loathing deep down convinced of his own merit not needing to humiliate anyone to prove it.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The mashup between feel-good and filthy traditional and trashy continues apace with ""The Sitter"" a weirdly charming comedy that puts an irresponsible guy in charge of three unhappy kids. Wholl crumble first? The movie stars Jonah Hill whose star continues to rise quite nicely -- but more on that momentarily. Instead lets start with the obvious caveat. ""The Sitter"" is wickedly absurd. Every parents fears about the caretaker brought in at the last minute get amped up here. So getting ones shorts in a knot about the situations that sitter Noah Griffith (Hill) puts youngsters Slater Blithe and Rodrigo in is a waste of ire. The comedy breaks in viewers from the get-go by offering a twist on R-rated bedroom activity. Later after Noah is sweetly guilt-tripped into a babysitting gig by his mom (Jessica Hecht) the movie proceeds to an ill-advised drug run. Its a comedy with kids not for kids. Turns out that making a pot movie does lead to the harder stuff. Director David Gordon Green -- maker of the ridiculously funny marijuana flick ""Pineapple Express"" -- sends his hapless protagonist on a fools errand to secure cocaine for his manipulative ""girlfriend"" Marisa portrayed as an easy narcissist by Ari Graynor. Yes he heads to Manhattan kids in tow. And Noahs nocturnal quest has the feel of Martin Scorseses Manhattan mishap comedy ""After Hours."" With the medical-marijuana movement bringing legitimacy to weed pot dealers just arent scary or wired enough for this tale. Enter Sam Rockwell. Hes a little bit Tony Montana. Hes a little bit Tommy DeVito from ""Goodfellas."" His lair is a combination of gay nightclub and muscle gym. Hes as likely to hug Noah as he is to wave a gun in his face. And hes surrounded by men of color. Which leads us to a second caveat This comedy is shameless about race. From its rap and Ramp;B soundtrack to the casting of Wu-Tang Clans Cliff ""Method Man"" Smith to the in-your-face sistah Tina (played with nice vigor by Samira Wiley) its clear this comedy is made by that generation of filmmakers freed by the ominpresence of hip-hop to be a little gangsta themselves. As for Noahs wards the children are just as much in need of transformation as he is. Oldest Slater is painfully aware of his anxiety disorder. Max Records who debuted as Max in ""Where the Wild Things Are"" captures a worriers pent-up fear. Little Blithe (Landry Bender) is an overly spirited girl with too much mascara and a troubling intimacy with pop cultures more inappropriate obsessions. And adopted son Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) needs a kid whisperer. What he gets is Noah. Which brings us back to the star. The hook of ""The Sitter"" is the rhetorical query ""Would you trust this arrested young adult with your kids?"" But the comedy works precisely because theres something to trust in Hill. Cast opposite Brad Pitt in ""Moneyball"" he contributed mightily to the films smart chemistry. He was a disturbing and eventually sympathetic troublemaker in 2010s dysfunction comedy ""Cyrus."" His self-deprecating appearance during a recent visit with David Letterman got at this tug some. Hes bright but thats not it. Hill brings a touch of moral sincerity and a hint of physical vulnerability to characters in smart-aleck films in need of something true and oddly decent to make them funny -- and not merely filthy.

"The Sitter -- Still crude but sometimes funny |       NJ.com comments The Sitter -- Still crude but sometimes funny Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 09 2011 at 830 AM View/Post Comments If you walk out of ""The Sitter"" after the first five minutes -- well I wouldnt be a bit surprised. Because the first five minutes are a pretty crude and graphic sex joke. Starring Jonah Hill. And not the new slim Hill of ""Moneyball"" but the big old Hill the one who looked like he used to scan the menu at the Tick Tock Diner and say ""Gimme the left side tonight."" So yes the film starts off ready -- make that eager -- to outrage you. Which seems to be the strategy of a lot of R-rated comedies these days and is probably more about getting scripts read by easily distracted executives than it is about easing an audience into a movie. Which is too bad because once you get past that first scene ""The Sitter"" is -- well its still crude. But its also sometimes funny. Hill plays Noah yet another of those oversized manchildren whove been showing up in comedies since ""Knocked Up"" slowly settling into their moms couch while their futures disappear behind them. Noah is a loser frankly but hes inspired to do one nice thing -- babysit a friends kids so his mother gets a chance to go out. Hes never done it before but hey how hard it can be? He has no idea. Because before the night is over there will be car crashes robberies explosions and various acts of violence -- most of the latter visited upon Noah. There will also be more politically incorrect crudity than an old Don Rickles routine. The movie gets a pass sort of because its even-handed in its rudeness -- every minority along with rich generic white people comes in for ridicule. None of that humor is particularly fresh -- it really cant be being based on stereotypes -- but little of it seems particularly mean. What does rankle are the jokes it makes at the expense of one of the kids a slightly unhinged adopted boy from Latin America. Well-armed gangstas and bourgeois bat-mitzvah parents may well be able to take care of themselves but mocking Third World orphans? Thats just bullying (and apparently after ""Jack and Jill"" newly popular). Some of the sting is eased by Hill who navigates this movies wild ride through a raunchier ""Adventures in Babysitting"" with a genuinely sweet sense of self-deprecation. Yes hes a sadsack loser but he knows it and his honest acceptance of that makes him easy to take. Hes also helped out by the great Sam Rockwell -- who remains one of the consistently wildest and most daring actors out there -- as Karl a starved-for-affection drug dealer. And also aided by a surprising gay-pride subplot that delivers its own ""It Gets Better"" message. Directed by David Gordon Green -- the half-baked arthouse darling who then went fully baked for ""Pineapple Express"" -- ""The Sitter"" is slapdash and often roughly edited. (The whole thing seems like a rushed apology for Greens other movie this year the awful ""Your Highness."") But if you can get past that rude-awakening opening -- and some of the rougher humor -- theres a comedy here. And probably the last halfway acceptable one of the year. Ratings note The film contains strong language drug references sexual situations and violence. The Sitter (R) Fox (81 min.) Directed by David Gordon Green. With Jonah Hill. Now playing in New Jersey.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 09 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Dec. 08 2011 459PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English The Sitter wants to be an R-rated comedy with a tender heart - or for those with longer memories a potty-mouthed take on Adventures in Babysitting. Its also designed as a vehicle for Jonah Hill a likeable actor who tickled funny bones in several Judd Apatow flicks showed off his more serious chops in Cyrus and the recent Moneyball and now wants a ride to call his own. Add up these three intentions - the down-and-dirty tone the tender and uplifting message the starring vehicle - and the math aint funny. Bottom line This movie is a whole lot less than the sum of its parts. Heres my quick proof. The R-rated Stuff Opening scene Chubby fully clothed and grateful Noah (Hill) is administering oral pleasure to his self-absorbed girlfriend who commends him on a job well done but shows zero interest in pursuing a reciprocal line of work. Poor neglected Noah. Otherwise hes unemployed still lives with his single mom is obliged to kick-start the plot by accepting a baby-sitting gig and promptly finds himself staring down the impressive cleavage of Mrs. Whoever the rich parent of the three spoiled kids in question. Theres 13-year old Slater who has ""severe anxiety issues"" and doesnt seem to know that hes gay - although we soon will. Theres nine-year-old Blithe who wears thick eye-makeup and acts like a prepubescent party girl - a wannabe Lindsay Lohan. And then theres little Rodrigo who being 10 and adopted and Latino merely looks sullen and blows things up. Before the flood of hilarity to come Noah gets an urgent phone call from that narcissistic girlfriend Shes at a party has run out of cocaine needs immediate replenishment. Her wish is his cue ""Kids were going on a field trip."" Understandably said trip involves a visit to the heavily set-dressed den of the local coke dealer (Sam Rockwell) who for reasons best known to himself surrounds himself with flunkies on rollerblades and body-builders on the cusp of roid rage. Of course the deal goes awry leaving Noah on the hook for 10 grand. Subsequently he robs and gets robbed; he chases and gets chased. En route the adults drop plenty of f-bombs while Rodrigo contents himself with dropping literal bombs in various washrooms which post-explosion gives him an excuse to indulge his second favourite pastime - peeing in public. Staying on the toilet-humour front Blithe may be all grown-up in manner yet her poopy pants tell a different story. I could continue but the category is already getting glutted so its on to The Tender Heart Noah natch is a nice guy deep down. Need proof? A few samples had better suffice one ""Slater youre gay and thats just fine. Theres nothing wrong with you""; two ""Blithe youre a kid and a pretty great one""; and for general consumption three ""You shouldnt waste your feelings on people who dont value you."" Thats about it. Compared to its dirty mouth the pictures heart is rather small - but its a good heart. The Vehicle Somehow even in this foul climate Hill manages to stay likeable although the strain definitely shows. The same cannot be said of director David Gordon Green. Once upon a time in George Washington and All the Real Girls he made films; then in Pineapple Express he downgraded to movies and in Eastbound amp; Down to TV shows. Clearly in the festive season hes now content with turkeys. Lets give the last word to Slater who in mid-turkey blurts out like the mixed-up kid he is ""I cant decide whether this is funny or not.""

Starring Jonah Hill Max Records JB Smoove Ari Graynor Director David Gordon Green Release Opened Dec 9 2011  Editorial Review Further adventures in babysittingBy Ann HornadayFriday Dec. 9 2011Reportedly ""The Sitter"" a raunchy new comedy starring Jonah Hill will be the last movie to feature the pear-shaped young actor in his heavyset form Hill having slimmed down considerably in recent months. Although the fatter-the-funnier equation is doubtlessly glib theres no question that when actors such as Hill and Seth Rogen seek deeper more complex roles - in ""Moneyball"" and ""50/50"" say - the first step always seems to be more protein shakes and fewer Ding-Dongs. For those fans who cherish Hills delicate balance of anxiety and self-confidence that finds its uncanny embodiment in a fat mans physical contradictions (claiming space while projecting unworthiness of it) ""The Sitter"" will constitute a vulgar fitfully funny if not completely fond farewell to Hills baby fat phase. Hill plays an arrested adolescent named Noah whos living at home with his mom after being suspended from college; with no discernible job in sight his chief occupation is pursuing a self-centered blonde named Marisa (Ari Graynor) who is enthusiastically enjoying his prowess in bed as ""The Sitter"" opens. Hand it to director David Gordon Green and his writers Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka At least they let filmgoers know exactly what theyre in for. ""The Sitter"" plays like an R-rated homage to the 1980s comedy ""Adventures in Babysitting"" with some ""Date Night"" and lots of filthy humor thrown in. Spiked with some loopily inspired supporting performances (Sam Rockwell turns up as a freaky tweaky drug dealer running the worlds most hilariously depraved coke den) and Hills characteristically inspired improvisational asides ""The Sitter"" is an efficient but uneven programmer whose most valuable contribution to the cinematic landscape is its blessedly brief 80-minute running time. ""The Sitter"" allows no opportunity for sophomorically leering humor to go unturned The reason Noah finds himself babysitting a neighbors three kids is that their regular sitter has a urinary tract infection (funny stuff). In the course of the ensuing night he and Slater (Max Records) Blithe (Landry Bender) and Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) run amok through a Brooklyn bat mitzvah an upscale restaurant a street-tough pool hall and a retail outlet called Neals Diamonds which they leave seconds before the place blows into smithereens. Green keeps the episodic beats coming at a reliable but mechanistic clip allowing Hill to get out of an escalating series of scrapes by dint of his quiet fast-talking cool. (One of ""The Sitters"" best set pieces is a smooth verbal groove-a-thon with a bouncer named Soul Baby played by Reggie A. Green.) One of the weaknesses of ""The Sitter"" is that Hill doesnt develop much comic chemistry with the children one of whom is an awkward neurotic one of whom is a pyromaniac and one of whom is a budding Paris Hilton who pronounces everything ""hot"" and wonders if a bar they land in has bottle service. The biggest kid of course is Noah himself another man-child abroad in a world that cant see the exquisite gifts behind the girth. Its a tired trope but with Rogen and now Hill signaling that theyre ready to leave it behind we may starve the beast yet.Contains crude and sexual content pervasive profanity drug material and some violence.

Im not Mary Poppins"" protests Jonah Hills Noah. No youre Elisabeth Shue and ""The Sitter"" is an unacknowledged remake of ""Adventures in Babysitting"" with the raunch dial turned up to max. Its smart funny agreeably perverse and simultaneously abrupt and exhausting. Noah gets things rolling with an oh-no-they-didnt dirty joke involving a companion Marisa (Ari Graynor) who may or may not be his girlfriend. If you dont like the opening youre probably not going to go for the rest because when Noahs mom forces him to take a baby-sitting gig his three charges turn out to be a Salvadoran kid Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) who likes to urinate on floors and blow up toilets; a precocious little girl Blithe (Landry Bender) who is eager to get started on being a slut; and a neurotic teen boy Slater (Max Records of ""Where the Wild Things Are"") who wears a fanny pack full of pills. When Marisa calls offering an opportunity to assuage his sexual frustrations all Noah has to do to score is score She needs him to drop by the local insane drug dealer (Sam Rockwell) and pick up some cocaine. Soon Noah and the minivan he has been forbidden to drive are squealing through Queens and Brooklyn. Its just like ""The Odyssey"" if Homer had thought of gay bodybuilders who work out to the ""Pina Colada"" song dinosaur eggs full of blow Sammy Davis Jr. impersonators a heist at a bat mitzvah and punishing a dude by shooting him in the roller skates. Blithe age 9 opines that Noah is ""a hot name"" because the Bible is ""a hot book"" applies a level of makeup suggestive of an Edwardian prostitute and requests a Red Bull and vodka. Rodrigo runs around in cowboy boots and pajamas tossing cherry bombs. Slater has a relatively simple issue hes gay -- ""queer as a football bat"" -- but as Noah points out this means merely that someday ""Youll get an excellent job in the entertainment industry youll be super-organized and youll smell good."" That scene is actually touching and cheery and while it doesnt quite fit in with the madness (pistols car chases and blowing up a jewelry store also figure) its one of the best in a movie that would have done well to catch its breath once in a while. As it is it calls to mind rock guitarist Andy Summers remark that when the Police first played they ripped through every song they knew with such fervid abandon that when they were done only 12 minutes had gone by. ""The Sitter"" begins to wind up at the one-hour mark and deposits you back on the street 15 minutes later (when credits begin to roll). The second half isnt as strong as the first. Rockwell for instance is initially hilarious as a lonely big-time cokehead and criminal whose feelings are hurt easily and Facebook-friends Noah immediately after they meet (but before the drug dealer realizes the kid Rodrigo has stolen enough cocaine to stuff a pillow). After a while he becomes more goofy than funny. Judd Apatow isnt credited in this movie (as he was in others Hill appeared in) and the quadrilateral balance between intelligent/ridiculous and warm/ribald hasnt quite been mastered by director David Gordon Green (who also did ""Pineapple Express"" a movie that was 20 minutes too flabby just as this one is 20 minutes too tight). Still he and the film leave us with wisdom for the ages ""Make love to the night motherf - - - er.""

"Movie review The Sitter - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review The SitterThe Sitter is a not-for-kids movie about a college dropout (Jonah Hill) baby-sitting some problematic kids. The raunch factor is high and the laugh factor is low.December 09 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Jonah Hill right Landry Bender Max Records and Kevin Hernandez star... (Jessica Miglio / 20th Century...)In ""The Sitter"" its hard to decide who is more to blame a the kids the adults or the filmmakers. Im going with the filmmakers as the folks most responsible for perpetrating this terribly unfunny and overwhelmingly raunchy film that stars the normally likable or at least comically forgivable Jonah Hill. He is neither here. I dont think its a case of everyone simply going for the big bucks either. Its actually hard to figure out who ""The Sitter"" would appeal to though Im sure director David Gordon Green (""Pineapple Express"") and writers Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka in their first produced screenplay are betting that Hills hard-core fans will line up for anything that has his name on it. The story itself is a very hard-R variation on ""Uncle Buck"" ifa| if the uncle was no relation if he was a sex-obsessed frequently stoned college dropout if the kids were irritating insane occasionally violent and spouting most of the profanity. The film opens on a low. A shot of a writhing young blond in the midst of an exhaustive moaning orgasm and then the camera pulls back to reveal Noah (Hill) lifting his head to switch from an oral to a verbal tease. No innuendo no humor no satisfaction. After his recent string of classy turns ""Moneyball"" opposite Brad Pitt in particular its sad to see Hill back to being the head of the crass but that is exactly where ""The Sitter"" lands him. Noah is yet another man-child role in this case hes got daddy issues money woes and his sweet single mom will miss a rare date if he doesnt fill in for her friends baby-sitter. If the rent werent free he would just say no. To set the ground rules for his charges Noah starts with death threats though from the looks of it this is a household that doesnt know the meaning of ground rules. Nine-year-old Blithe (Landry Bender) is perfecting a hooker style complete with heavy makeup and a potty mouth. Slater (Max Records) is a 13-year-old with high anxiety and pills to help him cope. Ten-year-old Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) recently adopted from Mexico has serious rage and runaway issues. More conflict is needed and it comes from the blond (Ari Graynor) who is finally promising full-on sex if hell only pick up a little cocaine from her crazy drug dealer Karl (Sam Rockwell). Right now. Of course Noah immediately packs up the kids and heads out into this very long dark about-to-turn disastrous night. There will be blood a and drugs and drinking and sex and violence and you know its coming enlightenment for all. The filmmakers try desperately to skate that thin line between socially redeeming and wanton excess by having Noah dish out some bits of wisdom and occasionally indicate he might care about the kids. But it is very thin ice and Hill never finds his balance to say nothing of his comic timing. Though table-turning ""The Ransom of Red Chief"" themes abound somehow the exploding toilet and all the other ""funny"" mayhem on which much of the films humor rides seem sad instead. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNoah Ark-sized ambition with uneven results early...March 21 2014Super Bowl ads Watch Noah get flooded Draft Day wheel...January 30 2014Clive Owen as a philanderer with a hint of The SitterOctober 24 2012Movie review American Reunion a raunchy homecomingApril 6 2012Noahs Ark Takes NBC to Higher GroundMay 5 1999MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-the-sitter-20111209,0,1555757.story?track=rss",200,thesitter11,thesitter,latimes

Daily Edition Login to download The Sitter Film Review 145 AM PST 12/9/2011 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Its back to the 80s for David Gordon Green in formula-worshipping comedy. TWITTER Jonah Hill bites off more than he can chew in this 80s up-all-night comedy. Replacing Elizabeth Shue with Jonah Hill cant be anyones idea of an upgrade but the formers spunky Adventures in Babysitting innocence would be a couple of notches too nice for The Sitter David Gordon Greens attempt to infuse the 1987 films setup with the grit and strangeness of other up-all-nighters by Scorsese and Demme. The fusion works far better than Greens sword-and-sandal-and-stoners dud Your Highness but is unlikely to connect with audiences like his previous 80s riff Pineapple Express. Hill plays loser Noah Griffith who facilitates a rare night out for his divorced mom by babysitting her friends three children -- any one of whom would be more than he can handle. A coddled neurotic a wannabe celebutante and a Salvadoran foster kid who loves blowing things up the three adolescent nightmares hint at how broadly screenwriters Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka will draw characters throughout the film particularly when it comes to African-Americans. Hills character may be less thin than the rest but little effort is put into convincing us hed make the series of dumb decisions The Sitter requires in order to keep him running through Manhattan and Brooklyn in the wee hours. A transparently dishonest phone call from Marisa (Ari Graynor) is all it takes to make Noah pack the kids into a stolen minivan and go in search of the cocaine he thinks will convince Marisa to have sex with him. (Where we wonder are the siblings supposed to wait during this couples tender moment?) Before the nights out hell be responsible for two stolen cars a pocketful of diamonds a few demolished bathrooms and enough wasted coke to turn a pool table snow white. In the midst of the familiar hijinks and confrontations that get between Noah and satisfaction one is weird enough to remember Sam Rockwells ""Karl with a K"" a gregarious gangster who packs his drugs in dinosaur eggs and hires effeminate bodybuilders as enforcers isnt really new territory for the actor but Rockwell gets more than his share of the films laughs hamming through it. Hill shows less snark and agitation than usual here and the restraint serves him well during the one sequence -- Noah counseling a kid who doesnt yet know hes gay -- in which the movie actually cares more about believability than retro affectations. All things considered though the kids would be a lot better off with Elizabeth Shue.

RICHsaid on Thursday December 15 2011 42652 PMI didnt like that Hills character condoned homosexuality. Its sinful and disgusting and had he instead encouraged the kid to stop doing that nonsense I would have liked that better..but because of liberal PC idiots they didnt do that And I like the stereotypes sednasaid on Wednesday December 14 2011 34933 PMlol I love The Rich. Awesome review Angelsaid on Monday December 12 2011 43954 PMWhen I saw the trailer for this movie I knew it was going to be obnoxious and full of the worst stereotypes but ultimately bland and forgettable. Im surprised it got an F grade. I also am stunned that the plot of ""random person is forced to take care of 3 weird kids and hilarity ensues while life lessons are learned"" was used. WHY was such an ininspired plot used? Its been done by everyone from Hulk Hogan to Vin Diesel. And I think Jackie Chan did it too. Sheesh. Most uncreative plot ever.

Jonah Hill and Sam Rockwell two of the funniest men around are wasted by a script eclipsed only by Adam Sandlers Jack and Jill in lazy storytelling.Hill plays Noah Griffith a college-aged slacker with a lousy girlfriend lonely mother and louse of a father who left him as a toddler. To The Sitters credit it takes all of four minutes to dive into the meat of the tale Noah is coaxed into babysitting three reprobates so his mother can go on a date.Theres nothing wrong in the setup but director David Gordon Green populates the movie with so many soap opera asides its hard to keep count. Youve got the sexually confused Slater (Max Records) the emotionally fractured Blithe (Landry Bender) and the misunderstood adopted vandal Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez). And throw in a cocaine dealer (Rockwell) bent on killing Noah at midnight.About the movieThe Sitter  1/2 out of fourStars Jonah Hill Ari Graynor Sam Rockwell Director David Gordon GreenDistributor 20th Century Fox Rating R for crude and sexual content pervasive language drug material and some violence Running time 1 hour 21 minutes Opens Friday nationwideThe Sitter doesnt offend as much as it could perhaps because its message of self-acceptance -- as delivered by Noah in 10-minute sermons to a phalanx of characters at the movies finale -- is sweet enough. And the soundtrack which includes The Sugarhill Gang and Slick Rick helps the 81 minutes pass. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Jessica Miglo/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of GalleryThe top 10 highest-grossing films I like Jonah Hill in both his goofball movies like ""Superbad"" and in ""Moneyball"" where playing a baseball stats whiz-kid he proved he could act in something that didnt require the display of bodily functions. In ""The Sitter"" directed by David Gordon Green hes trying to sustain his acting chops in a vehicle undeserving of them. He plays Noah a reluctant baby sitter who ends up ferrying his three charges on a comically nightmarish night on the town. Nine-year-old Blithe (Landry Bender) is a foul-mouthed would-be debutante; Slater (Max Records) is a pill-popping 13-year-old with unspecified anxiety disorders; Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) is a foster child from Mexico who carries cherry bombs in his pants and likes to blow things up.Since one of Noahs nighttime missions is to score some cocaine to impress a potential girlfriend (Ari Graynor) theres also much drug humor or lack of as well as the usual parade of scatological and politically incorrect jests. Its one thing I suppose to feature this stuff with teens or adults in the cast but having a 9-year-old girl along for the ride is especially noxious. Sit this one out.

Comments (1) click to enlarge The Sitter Rated R  82 minutes  2011 A suburban slacker (Jonah Hill just prior to his dramatic weight loss) agrees to babysit three spoiled kids then drags them into the city so he can score some coke for a girlfriend and he thinks get himself laid in return. As with many R-rated studio comedies the transgressive humor isnt nearly as offensive as the phony sentiment thats supposed to redeem it supplied here in stale scenes of the sitter bonding with his little charges. You could probably write a dissertation on the movies racial anxiety from a safe and tidy white world the sitter ventures into an urban nightmare of badass brothas and sistas (though theyre gullible enough to be disarmed by his masterful jive-talking). This repellent dualism is complicated only by the careful addition of a vicious white coke dealer (Sam Rockwell) and a sweet black hottie (Kylie Bunbury) with an inexplicable crush on the obese hero.

Jessica Miglio/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Jessica Miglio/Twentieth Century Fox The Sitter Directors David Gordon Green Genre Comedy Running Time 81 minutes Rated R for crude and sexual content pervasive language and some violence With Jonah Hill Ari Graynor and Sam Rockwell Watch Clips From The Sitter - Im Not A Real Babysitter Im Not A Real Babysitter Credit Twentieth Century Fox From The Sitter - Thats Pretty Weird Thats Pretty Weird Credit Twentieth Century Fox From The Sitter - I Just Want To Be Your Friend I Just Want To Be Your Friend Credit Twentieth Century Fox Jonah Hill Hollywoods go-to blubbering slacker tries to pick up some easy money in The Sitter. It looks like a plush job Hang out with kids say some dirty things learn some life lessons pocket the cash. The film could be called Dont Tell Mom the Baby Sitters Dead Inside. Except baby-sitting is harder than it looks and so is comedy -- even in a movie this inconsequential. Hills trademark verbal hyperactivity never truly breaks through a script thats way more complicated than it needs to be what with kickboxers exploding toilets stolen drugs two stolen cars a love triangle and a Bat Mitzvah caper. And still none of it is inherently funny -- as evidenced by how many scenes depend for a punchline on Hill swearing at one child or another. Hills deeply insecure Noah has volunteered to watch three deeply insecure kids for one night. Each youngster has generously been given one personality trait. Theres Slater a shy confused preteen who seems like hed bruise easily. (Hes played by Max Records who previously acted as guardian to 8-foot creatures in Where the Wild Things Are and whose reduction to panicky-prop status seems like a regression in more ways than one.) We also get the heavily made-up Blithe (Landry Bender) who according to her mother is ""in her celebutante phase""; and Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) an adopted Latino pyromaniac. The siblings all exist inside their own bubbles spouting their own one-liners never hinting that they knew each other before Noah came over. The films adults are the same way although since they mostly consist of drug dealers coked-out girlfriends and emotionally unavailable parents this seems a little more plausible. Theres a message somewhere about the devastating consequences of unhappy childhoods but its buried so deeply not even the movie knows what it is. The Sitter is nothing if not economical. In a mere 81 minutes Noah solves all of his charges most closely guarded psychological problems as well as his own and those of several other acquaintances he happens to run into. (Slow down Noah. Youre charging by the hour. Save some of the family issues for next weekend.) Director David Gordon Green who also helmed Your Highness has by now distanced himself about as much as possible from the stylistic panache of his 2000 debut George Washington. Its not just that The Sitter employs racist homophobic and xenophobic humor its that the film does it in such lazy fashion. One downside of being the last arrival in a year with around a dozen raunchy R-rated comedies is that the shock factor is no longer on your side; simply dropping a few choice words in front of children isnt enough to provoke a laugh from audiences whove seen far more twisted things in The Hangover Part II. The film compensates for its comedy deficit by being overly saccharine. From the halfway point on were squarely in impassioned-speech territory at which point Hill becomes of all things the killjoy. Ultimately The Sitter is less Adventures in Babysitting and more Adventures in Therapy. Screenwriters Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka on their first credited feature-length film are so eager to get to the characters redemption that they glaze over the bits we came to see Jonah Hill behaving badly around minors. Isnt that just like a baby sitter to hurry us off to bed before weve even had our snack?

Jonah Hill ranks somewhere between Christopher Walken and Gary Busey on the list of Hollywood character actors you might trust to spend an evening watching your kids. That in itself is a recipe for laughs ""The Sitter"" handily exploits but in all other respects this ostensibly wild-and-crazy romp plays things too close to the book to feel genuinely wild or crazy -- unless of course the auds are underage themselves which seems to be the target director David Gordon Green had in mind when baking this bemusingly inappropriate R-rated laffer. As seasonal counterprogramming ""The Sitter"" stands to score some easy money. A college dropout whos moved back in with Mom reluctant babysitter Noah (Hill) never discusses his fee for minding a trio of New York brats but whatever theyre paying him aint nearly enough. Where other little girls read Golden Books 9-year-old Blithe (Landry Bender) peruses Page Six aspiring to be a trashy celebutante when she grows up. Her 13-year-old brother Slater (""Where the Wild Things Ares"" Max Records) may seem aloof but is in fact so heavily medicated he can barely muster the energy to flip his Justin Bieber-style bangs much less cope with his latent homosexuality. Renegade adopted sibling Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez awfully young to be playing such a crass Latino stereotype) more than compensates for Slaters apathy planting cherry bombs in toilets and urinating in the most inappropriate places. Sound hilarious? Noah doesnt think so which is why the schlubby loser decides that instead of staying indoors hell drag the kids along for a night of drug deals gang fights and party crashing because nothing says funny like a babysitter covered in cocaine at the wheel of a minivan. Unlikely as it may seem given the poignant character dramas that launched his career Green actually seems more comfortable orchestrating this kind of manufactured outrageousness. And though the pic shares the same anarchic spirit as Greens two previous forays into lowbrow comedy ""Pineapple Express"" and ""Your Highness"" this latest outing most clearly demonstrates his affection for such 80s-era celebrations of irresponsibility run amok as ""Risky Business"" and ""Ferris Buellers Day Off."" On those terms ""The Sitter"" makes an adequate companion though its hardly the sort of film to inspire similar homages in 20 years time. First-time screenwriters Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka put Noah and his young charges through a gantlet of familiar obstacles building most of the punchlines around how out of place three rich kids are say robbing a jewelry store or rescuing Noah from a smackdown. Woven throughout are obligatory emotional moments in which Noah finds time to counsel each of the children on how to cope with their various conditions while sorting out unresolved relationship business with his father (Bruce Altman) and girlfriend (Ari Graynor). Thats a lot of ground to cover in 81 minutes which is perhaps ""The Sitters"" saving grace as editor Craig Alpert keeps things brisk enough that the pic never overstays its welcome. Pair that with a handful of genuinely unique flourishes such as the zany warehouse space where scantily clad bodybuilders help a bipolar Karl (Sam Rockwell) run his narcotics operation and the film delivers in terms of laughs. With additional zingers looped into the tail end of scenes the pic feels tighter than most contempo comedies even if the premise is as slender as they come. From ""Kindergarten Cop"" to ""The Pacifier"" most wrong-person-for-the-job child-care movies are aimed squarely at kids and the humor here manages to be every bit as juvenile even as it qualifies as too raunchy for a PG rating -- apparent from the opening oral-sex scene. Material like this hardly seems the best use of Hills talents and yet he comes off as enough of a softie here to sustain a losing tug-of-war with three pre-pubescent hellions which is precisely what the role demands. Among the kids Bender steals the show playing against her adorable child-model looks at every turn while Records tackles a part that uses the actors odd oncamera stiffness to its advantage.

Hill is Noah suspended from college and living at home. He reluctantly agrees to babysit a neighbors three kids for reasons that would wring a tear from Charles Dickens The sitter canceled at the last minute and unless Noah fills in the kids parents wont be able to go to a party. And if they dont go out they cant introduce Noahs Mom (Jessica Hecht) to a nice single guy they know. And that would be a pity since Noahs Mom has been all alone ever since Noahs S.O.B. dad (Bruce Altman) bailed on the family years ago. Noah really loves his Mom and wants her to be happy especially since Mom thinks her son is wonderful even if he wont move his butt off the couch. Elizabeth Shues motivations for taking a similar childcare gig in Adventures in Babysitting 24 years ago -- her boyfriend cancels their date -- look lame by comparison. Noah is Jonah Hill-ish at least as manifest in the talented young actors Husky-Boy Period -- which is to say hes sluggish in locomotion placid in demeanor and schlubbish in wardrobe. Hes also a pro at deadpan quips and at heart a nice guy. (How nice is he? Hes so nice that he patiently expertly gives the gift of oral sex to the manipulative beeyotch he calls his girlfriend even when she doesnt return the favor. Ari Graynor is excellently beeyotchy in the role.) Anyway Noahs three young charges are predictable challenges Slater (Max Records from Where the Wild Things Are) is prim studious and anxious; Blithe (Landry Bender) is a little girl wearing the make-up and wardrobe of a Jersey Shore wannabe in pursuit of her burning ambition to be a celebrity; and Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) adopted from El Salvador is in the predictably non-PC portion of the show a destructive pint-sized gangster from the Scarface school of Hispanic menace. Screeching adventures follow involving but not limited to guns car theft Scary-looking Black People Who Turn Out to Be Nice cocaine and a drug den presided over by Sam Rockwell in one more crazy-eyed role. Director David Gordon Green moves his cast all over the screen with a desperation that should at least encourage the directors fans to revisit Pineapple Express as a consolation prize. (Better yet check out the filmmakers really great early indie movies especially George Washington and All the Real Girls.) I trust Im not spoiling any surprises by reporting that every single character learns valuable life lessons in the end and becomes a better boy or girl man or woman for the trouble. Noah even delivers a really good speech to a young person in need of reassurance that being gay is okay. What that It Gets Better moment is doing in the middle of a coarse comedy like The Sitter I dont know. But like a sitter raiding the fridge when her charges are in bed Ill take my snack where I can get it.

But Green should have fessed up to glomming from another 80s classic Chris Columbus Adventures in Babysitting too What starts as a ho-hum evening of suburban brat-watching turns into a crazed night of mobsters menace and mayhem in the big city. More about The Sitter >> Switch Elisabeth Shue for Jonah Hill add heapings of sex and profanity and there you go. In The Sitter Hill stars as Noah Griffith a layabout nerd who reluctantly agrees to take care of a neighbors kids as a favor for his single mom (with whom he still resides). His plan is to drop himself on the couch pick up the remote and vedge for a couple of hours. But then Marisa (Ari Graynor) his would-be girlfriend calls from a party in the city and so Noah piles his three charges - potty-mouthed princess Blithe (Landry Bender) anxiety-ridden 13-year-old Slater (Max Records) and El Salvadoran adoptee Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) - into their parents minivan. First they have to score some drugs and then well . . . weird wild stuff ensues. Green has made a trio of quiet beautifully crafted indies (George Washington All the Real Girls Snow Angels) and the instant stoner classic Pineapple Express. But hes also responsible for the instantly stupid medieval weed-com Your Highness - and while The Sitter isnt that dumb or dreadful there really isnt much going on here. Strike that. Theres a lot going on. The problem is that its all predictable pushing-the-R-rating raunch and carnage. Want to hear pipsqueaks spew profanity? Check. Want to see Rodrigo take a pee in the middle of a swank restaurant? Check. Want to watch gangstas getting mocked? Check. Want to see Sam Rockwell go psycho with a gun? Check. (Hes a crazed coke dealer of course.) In summers Moneyball Hill proved himself capable of considerably more than the sardonic slobby shtick weve become accustomed to seeing him do. His work with Brad Pitt showed not only energy and earnestness but also a fierce intelligence - you could see the actor prodding himself into new territory and it was kind of a thrilling thing to witness. But in The Sitter Hill is back in default mode. And his director seems to be too. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Director David Gordon Green. (128). R Sexuality language drug use violence. At area theaters. ""The Sitter"" is not only an atrocious shout-out to bad 80s comedies its also the kind of movie Jonah Hill should look at as a crass blast from his past. After serious turns in ""Cyrus"" and especially ""Moneyball"" as well as a recent well-noted weight loss ""The Sitter"" arrives like a warning of what might have been had he not made those choices. Still here it is and we have to deal with it. Suspended college dude Noah (Hill) is recruited to babysit his neighbors kids so his mom can go with her friends to an event. They turn out to be pains in Noahs large behind not to mention cliches (a toddler with a tiara a sensitive misfit middle-schooler a pyromaniac foster child). Assigned by his girlfriend (Ari Graynor) to pick up cocaine from a wild-man drug dealer (Sam Rockwell doing what he can) Noah and his young charges have a wild crazy night in Manhattan and Brooklyn never once stumbling upon anything funny. Yes there are life lessons though theyre as dumb as the comedy. Meanwhile director David Gordon Green (""Pineapple Express"" ""Your Highness"") seems to think slowly wiggling the camera as if it were on a waterbed filled with Jell-O will up the yuks. And Hill winds up as a junior-version Uncle Buck. Its reasonable for filmmakers to want to pay homage to early-80s Spielberg (""Super 8"") or even that eras innovative horror (""The Thing""). But really why would anyone give a shout-out to ""Adventures in Babysitting""? Magic Moment James Franco never far from anything pops up in a clip on a soap opera.

The Sitter Fair to good Director David Gordon Green. Cast Jonah Hill Ari Graynor Sam Rockwell. Rating R for crude and sexual content pervasive language drug material and some violence. Guys as caretakers I certainly was. The main reason is the actor who plays the sitter Jonah Hill. (And yes for the record he shot this film before losing weight.) Hill is a tremendously talented actor -- he deserves an Oscar nomination for his role in ""Moneyball."" But his work in this film is probably even greater proof of how good he is. If he can make this worth sitting through ... Of course having Sam Rockwell on hand as a uniquely insane murderous drug dealer is a big plus too. This is definitely the kind of movie in which you will laugh a lot and then feel vaguely guilty about it. The story is ridiculous the individual set pieces even more so but Hill simply plunges headlong into them playing them for all theyre worth and more often than not coming out ahead of the game. Hill plays Noah kicked out of college and living at home with his mother (Jessica Hecht). Hes so lazy he cant bestir himself sufficiently to answer the telephone though he does manage to alert his mother to its ringing. He is in a relationship sort of with Marisa (Ari Graynor) who uses him for sexual favors and in the transaction that drives the movie to score cocaine. The complicating factor is that when she calls with her order Noah is baby-sitting three kids who range from confused to criminally dangerous. He didnt want the job and hes predictably terrible at it. Hes doing it as a favor for his mom so that she might have a night out with a blind date. Hill is great at portraying these kinds of moments of sweetness and simple human decency often between spitting out raunchy asides. So its no surprise that after a rough start he connects with the kids hes supposed to be responsible for -- Slater (Max Records) a confused boy with identity issues; Blithe (Landry Bender) a pint-size would-be celebutante; and Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) recently adopted and an enthusiastic pyrotechnician. Theyre handful enough without a trip into New York City to score blow for Marisa a jaunt that leads to Noahs meeting with Karl (Rockwell) an absurdly friendly dealer who surrounds himself with shirtless bodybuilders and numbers his friends (""I just shot my third-best friend in the foot""). Not that a drug run would ever be simple but Noahs grows increasingly complicated as more and more things go wrong. Yet through the magic of movies he is not shot in the head by Karls henchmen (though not for lack of effort) and instead inadvertently teaches the kids lessons about life -- and learns a lot about himself in the process. An exchange with Slater is particularly sweet. Yes its that sappy in between the F-bomb barrage. But Hill brings an infectious confidence to his performance even when hes supposedly down and out. He is gleefully profane a courageous smart-aleck looking for truth in the most outrageous situations often finding it. ""The Sitter"" isnt Hills best movie not by a long shot (it is in fact a sort of lesser comic version of ""Cyrus"" in which he plays a more seriously tormented young man living with his mother). But its one worth watching something that can be said of most of his films without hesitation. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontz arizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

But dont get the wrong idea The sweet scene arrives at about the halfway point between the gag when babysitter Jonah Hill gets mistaken for a pedophile (funny offensive) and the bit about how handy it is to have a black street gang on your side (dumb offensive). Noah (Hill) is on an involuntary break from college living in the New York suburbs with his understanding single mom (Jessica Hecht) which makes him a lot like Hills character in Cyrus minus the personality disorder. He gets suckered into babysitting for her friends the Pedullas because their sitter cancelled on them threatening plans to introduce his mom to a promising single man. Noah doesnt want his mom to miss the date. Hes already established himself as a pushover in an opening sequence with his ""girlfriend"" Marissa (Ari Graynor) during which he performs a sexual favor on her without getting anything in return. She thanks him the way people thank each other for lifts home. Graynor is delightfully horrible as usual. (MORE The Top 10 Least Sexiest Sex-Filled Movies) His charges are a nightmare but an appealing batch of child actors. Slater (Max Records from Where the Wild Things Are looking like a long lost Culkin) is 13 and heavily medicated for severe anxiety issues. Blithe (Landry Bender) is a celebrity-obsessed creature of about eight. She greets Noah with the pronouncement that Noah is a ""hot name."" He begs to differ ""Its actually biblical."" ""The Bible is a hot book"" comes the retort. Shes smeared with makeup. An evening of watching iCarly is unlikely to satisfy this child. Finally there is Rodrigo (clever Kevin Hernandez) who falls between them in age. The Pedullas adopted Rodrigo from El Salvador a year ago. He likes fireworks breaking things and speaks like a gangbanger. Politically correct The Sitter is not. Of course this quartet leaves the house to venture into the big city. While this may sound like an updated version of the 80s film Adventures in Babysitting its a bit more R-rated. Marissa calls and asks Noah to procure her some coke from drug dealer Karl (Sam Rockwell in manic mode which grows boring) and deliver it to her at a party. The children are not helpful on this errand and Noah ends up in debt to the unstable Karl. From there its just a hop skip and jump to grand theft. The Sitter falls far short of the joyous insanity of the raunchy/sweet Superbad which made Hill a star. The preview audience I saw it with laughed hard at a reference to Jon Benet Ramsey but had the decency to fall quiet during the awkward scenes that showed the children under direct threat from Karls pistola. After that the movie never recovered its rhythm. (MORE The Top 10 Macho Movie Posses) But Hill is a strong comic and this movie considerably funnier than director Greens last the execrable Your Highness -- low standard -- allows the actor to show off his beautiful timing (also evident in Moneyball but without the hijinks). Screenwriters Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka have barely a screen credit between them but they understand the Hill persona a little whisper here an off-the-cuff insult that lands as softly as a kiss and a nonplussed doubletake followed by a quick rejoinder. Noah is the fat guy who wears a plaid flannel shirt underneath a jacket opened to reveal a clashing plaid lining. Hes also good and decent and open to admitting all of his faults. ""I had a month-long intense addiction to Robitussin"" he tells Slater trying to put him at ease. The Sitter is predicated on a belief that chunky Jonah Hill or at least the persona he presents is secretly supercool. While it turns out to be a wisp of a movie on that front at least it is persuasive.

"The Sitter (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Sitter (R) Director David Gordon Green hits a career low with this tired lazy comedy. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/8/2011 Editor rating 1 One more reason to hate the 80s All the terrible comedies that pay homage to the vacuous decade. The Sitter isnt as bad as Hot Tub Time Machine or Take Me Home Tonight. It is much much worse. This odious hypocritical movie marks director David Gordon Greens devolution into full-on hack. How did the guy who once made such artful pictures as George Washington and All the Real Girls and Undertow arrive here? Does money corrupt that quickly? Did the success of Pineapple Express suddenly make Green forget everything that once interested him about film? His last movie Your Highness was also a dud but at least you could respect its ambition. The Sitter however is a crass cash grab - a bottom-feeder entertainment that insults bottom feeders. Written by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka (this is their first produced screenplay) the movie comes on all cheerfully disreputable. We meet the portly Noah (Jonah Hill) as hes showing the pretty Marisa (Ari Graynor) some ""mouth love"" an act shes unwilling to reciprocate. When his mother divorced and single asks Noah to babysit her friends kids so she can go out on a date he reluctantly agrees. But he regrets his decision the moment he meets his young charges The anxiety-ridden Slater (Max Records) the rebellious Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) and the precocious Blithe (Landry Bender) who is obsessed with becoming a celebrity and talks about nightclubs and partying even though shes eight. If youve seen Adventures in Babysitting you know what happens next Circumstances force Noah to drag the kids into adult situations including a visit to a drug den a robbery at a jewelry store and a high-speed car chase complete with flying bullets. The Sitter strives to be subversive and heartwarming at the same time but it only succeeds at being offensive. Sam Rockwell plays a gay cocaine dealer who surrounds himself with bodybuilders and roller-skating queens and Samira Wiley is a former classmate of Noah who enjoys threatening Caucasians with her fellow hip-hop thugs. The movie tries to mine laughs from its mincing homos and scary black people then excuses its racist prejudiced stereotypes by making one of the kids gay and giving Jonah an African-American love interest (Kylie Bunbury). See? Were only kidding We dont really mean it This is the Birth of a Nation of low-brow comedies. The Sitter makes a wan attempt to channel the 1980s via name-checking and ridiculously obscure cameos. American Anthem and I Come in Peace are playing on the TV; Morrissey and Bel Biv DeVoe get quick shout-outs; Escape (The Pina Colada Song) and Apache (Jump on It) are heard on the soundtrack. Theres a joke about ""the two redrum chicks from The Shining"" one of the few lines in the movie thats funny. But The Sitter is so moribund that even Hill who also served as executive producer looks zonked-out and anesthetized. The story is completely devoid of any kind of sense whatsoever A kids cherry bomb blows up half a building and the impending geomagnetic storm that everyone makes such a fuss over at the beginning of the film is completely forgotten. Green whose previous movies all had a nice visual style cant even come up with a single memorable image. This is a crummy hateful picture.

"The Sitter movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Sitter Adventure in baby-sitting adds raunch and violence a 2 starsDecember 08 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJonah Hill co-stars with a cast of kids in ""The Sitter.""Mildly funny adventures in extreme baby-sitting director David Gordon Greens ""The Sitter"" finds its emblematic moment in the scene of Sam Rockwell playing a Brooklyn drug dealer joking around and then suddenly blasting one of his minions in the foot in a realistically painful way. Thats Green for you. Hes the man behind ""Pineapple Express."" Hahahahaha and suddenly theres blood on the floor.If it were up to Green every movie would ride on the careening mood swings of a 70s picture such as ""Freebie and the Bean."" Hes an interesting director of considerable talent -- he made the beautiful patient dramas ""George Washington"" and ""Snow Angels"" -- so even when hes just delivering an 82-minute star vehicle fast cheap and on a modest budget at least there are things to discuss. And at least ""The Sitter"" is built around Jonah Hill who has what it takes to anchor a stupid crude comedy. Unlike Danny McBride who served as the nominal center of Greens stupider cruder ""Your Highness.""The brisk first scene in ""The Sitter"" establishes a great deal in just a couple of minutes introducing Noah (Hill) with his sometime/not really girlfriend (Ari Graynor) whose interest in cocaine sends Noah on a dangerous all-night mission with three kids in tow. The eldest (played by Max Records of ""Where the Wild Things Are"") is an anxiety-riddled wet blanket; the adopted El Salvadoran middle child (Kevin Hernandez) is a pyromaniac who likes to blow up toilets; the youngest (Landry Bender) is a female preteen dangerously into looking like a trashed-out celebrity en route to the Betty Ford Clinic.These kids and their overbearing insecurities need Noahs tough love according to the slapdash script by newbies Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and if ""The Sitter"" finds an audience itll be thanks to the movies collision of nastiness and sentimentality. Thats how a lot of comedies are these days some more amusing than ""The Sitter"" some less. I hope Green one day finds a way to bridge the style and rhythm of his early pictures (the ones that didnt make money) and the bumper-car approach of ""The Sitter.""mjphillipstribune.comThe Sitter -- 2 starsMPAA rating R (for crude and sexual content pervasive language drug material and some violence)Running time 122Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesHollywood Reacts to Gandolfini News on TwitterJune 19 2013NBC pilot filming in River North to involve smoke and...March 22 2012Find More Stories AboutNoahJonah HillTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1207-sitter-20111208,0,4308115.column",200,thesitter27,thesitter,chicagotribune

Share Tweet Little has flummoxed cinephiles like the curious case of David Gordon Green a writer-director who started his career with George Washington and All The Real Girls poetic visions of youth that had him looking like Terrence Malicks heir apparent but has lately resigned himself to major-studio slacker comedies like Pineapple Express and the unfortunate Your Highness. Greens latest The Sitter seemingly falls firmly in the latter camp as it once again champions an oafish layabout (Jonah Hill) whos dragged into an adventure kicking and screaming. Yet in its best moments--and there are several good ones scattered across this ramshackle comedy--The Sitter is a reminder that Greens sensibility has always been heavy on whimsy and play and that maybe he hasnt strayed that far from home. Trouble is when youre paying feature-length homage to Adventures In Babysitting rather than something like Malicks Days Of Heaven the ceiling gets awfully low. Built comfortably around Hills talent for amiable hostility The Sitter casts him as a Bad Santa-type who reluctantly takes a babysitting job to help give his single mother a night out. His child-care style is just a notch above gross negligence. His three charges are all terrors in their own way Max Records is an intensely neurotic overmedicated head-case; younger sister Landry Bender imagines herself as a Kardashian but looks more a Toddlers amp; Tiaras contender; and Kevin Hernandez an El Salvadoran orphan is a troublemaker with a flair for pyrotechnics. On a mission to please his awful girlfriend Hill loads the kids into a minivan and heads into the city to score coke from an eccentric dealer (Sam Rockwell). Needless to say things dont go as planned. In spite of the affection Green has for Adventures In Babysitting The Sitter views the city as more goofy and surreal than hostile which defuses the ugly racial politics of Babysitting and other 80s suburban-family comedies. And unlike Elisabeth Shue Hill has no intention of being a responsible caretaker which makes him just as impulsive and easily distracted as the kids dragging them (and the movie) into unexpected comic situations. (Filling out Rockwells drug lair with roided-out bodybuilders a roller-skating lackey and cocaine-packed dinosaur eggs is just one indication of the films loopiness.) Given its lumpy episodic nature The Sitter misses as often as it hits and the stoner listlessness that dominated Your Highness occasionally creeps into the storytelling. Yet the precocious naif behind George Washington hasnt disappeared entirely here--it just takes a little squinting to see him.
