The brothers Stangle Mike (Adam DeVine) and Dave (Zac Efron) twentysomething liquor salesmen and roommates have messed up too many family gatherings with their antics and when their younger sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) plans a destination wedding in Hawaii their parents demand that the young men bring proper young women to keep them on their best behavior. Mike and Dave place an ad on Craigslist and get scammed by the hard-partying Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) who present themselves as sedate and then in Hawaii cut loose. Kendrick plays the slightly more sentimental Alice with puckish intelligence and Plaza as the uninhibited Tatiana lets fly with quietly blazing profanities. Alice Wetterlund co-stars as the brothers cousin Terry a sharp and free-spirited lesbian and Kumail Nanjiani plays a masseur with cool manners and hot methods but the frivolities are tame and stereotyped. The resulting chaos threatens to drive Jeanie and her fiance Eric (Sam Richardson) apart but theyre so thinly characterized that theres no reason to care. Directed with scant comedic flair by Jake Szymanski.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

Its a bummer that the jokes dont land often enough especially in the final third when the tone takes a turn for the tame. WTF?

Mike and Dave Stangle really are party-hard brothers from upstate New York who took an ad on Craigslist to find two ""nice girls"" to take to a cousins wedding. They appeared on The Wendy Williams Show and even wrote a 2015 memoir. Hollywood takes that premise and runs with it. Adam DeVine of the goofy grin and two Pitch Perfect movies plays the bubble-brained Mike. And Zac Efron of the cut abs and two Neighbors movies plays the studly Dave. In the first of the films flights from reality its not a cousin getting married but the boys younger sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard). She wants her horny bros to bring decent dates to her destination wedding in Hawaii. And before you can say millennial Wedding Crashers were off. Devine and Efron whos finding a nice comic groove these days let it all hang out sometimes literally. But the best twist in the movie is that their dates steal the show. Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) can out-gross the guys without losing a fake eyelash. To snag a free trip to Honolulu these two boozy perpetually stoned waitresses prove hilariously adept at pretending to be good girls. Kendrick has a ball breaking type by playing a loose cannon. And Plaza the films MYP  is killer funny using her delicious deadpan to eviscerate  every trace of rampant male ego. Its good news that the four actors are so in sync because the script by Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien who did better with both Neighbors movies comes dangerously close to running aground from running around in crushingly repetitive circles. Luckily TV director Jake Szymanski in his feature debut shows a knack for shaping a comic sequence such as an outing for the foursome on the Hawaiian turf where Jurassic Park was filmed. What ultimately spoils this Mike and Dave party is letting the jokes go from crude to cruder without giving us anything beyond raunch to remember.

"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mike-and-dave-need-wedding-dates ) Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (United States 2016) July 08 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates exemplifies what passes for ""raunchy comedy"" these days plenty of vulgarity and profanity without many accompanying laughs. In trying to push the R-rated envelope filmmakers have become so focused on being outrageous that they have lost sight of being funny. Theres a skill to generating hilarity from nonstop profanity and the creative team of director Jake Szymanski and writers Andrew Jay Cohen amp; Brendan OBrien dont have it. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is steeped in swearing but little of it contributes to the films ""comedy."" Like much of what transpires during the course of this production its just crass. The story makes as much sense as any modern R-rated comedys narrative - which is to say not much. Dave (Zac Efron) and Mike Stangle (Adam Devine) are hell-raising brothers. They like to have a good time and sometimes their idea of a ""good time"" crosses a line into mayhem. More often than not their antics turn family events into 911 calls. Their parents Burt (Stephen Root) and Rosie (Stephanie Faracy) are determined to put an end to this. So for the wedding of their daughter Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) they have decided to implement a new rule for Dave and Mike to attend they must bring dates. For reasons that are never clearly explained the Strangles believe that female companionship will somehow curb Dave and Mikes destructive tendencies. Getting dates with ""nice"" girls is a problem for the boys so they turn to the Internet for help. Pretty soon their ad - offering an all-expense paid trip to Hawaii - has gone viral and attracted the attention of a lot of women most of whom are undesirable as traveling companions. Among the potential dates are Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) women who are the exact opposite of what Dave and Mike are looking for. But they want to go to Hawaii so they fake it. Their plan works and once they end up on the shores of the 50th state their true natures emerge. By design comedies rarely feature strong narratives or believable character arcs. These movies have a single purpose to infect viewers with paroxysms of laughter. It stands to reason that the more one laughs during a film the less he or she will care about things like whether the protagonist has a compelling backstory or the ending is credible. When a production is unable to generate the level of humor necessary to keep the audience in stitches the screenwriting deficiencies become apparent. In something like Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates the paucity of good jokes makes the films journey 98 minutes of tedium. The comedy fails in large part because of laziness. Theres nothing clever here. The filmmakers believe that broad obvious gags pratfalls and profanity-laced tirades are inherently funny. Theyre not. Those things generate laughter when someone shapes tweaks or delivers them in such a way that they lose the predictable generic quality that permeates nearly every moment of Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. On those few occasions when this movie tickles the funny bone its because of something unexpected or seemingly spontaneous. Zac Efron is a good-looking man but he brings little in the way of screen presence to the movie. Theres little to differentiate Dave from the character Efron played in the two Neighbors movies. Adam Devine has the unenviable role of playing the loud socially awkward brother and his performance consists of overacting and making strange faces. Anna Kendrick the Pitch Perfect princess fails to convince us that she can be a bad girl. The only one who fits comfortably into her role is Aubrey Plaza who is credible for about two-thirds of the proceedings until the script assassinates her character. Theres nothing unique in the failure of Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. The ability to make a good comedy has become a lost art and much of what we see is like this. The expectation is that well laugh because its supposed to be funny not because it is funny. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates spends the entirety of its running length going through the motions.

"Stars of Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates get sacrificed at the comedy altar - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Stars of Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates get sacrificed at the comedy altar ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" Gemma LaMana / 20th Century Fox Aubrey Plaza from left Anna Kendrick Adam Devine and Zac Efron star in the comedy ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates."" Aubrey Plaza from left Anna Kendrick Adam Devine and Zac Efron star in the comedy ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates."" (Gemma LaMana / 20th Century Fox) Katie Walsh Although the premise is spelled out right there in the title ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" makes very little sense. Thats despite it being based (shockingly) on a book. Well a ""book"" written by brothers Mike and Dave Stangle as an obligatory cash-in on their viral Craigslist ad.But even though the opening credits claim that the film is ""inspired by the life stories of Mike and Dave Stangle"" and also ""based on a true story. Sort of"" the movie version somehow has absolutely no connection to reality. Thats OK -- sex comedies shouldnt necessarily resemble real life. But the film doesnt even convincingly craft its own internal reality in this story about a pair of rowdy brothers who end up with an even rowdier pair of dates to their sisters wedding. There are no rules or character motivations words come out of Zac Efrons mouth when it isnt moving and Anna Kendricks wig changes color seemingly at random.The script by Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien who adapted the book is a disappointing nosedive after their screenplay for ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising."" ""Mike and Dave"" is directed by Jake Szymanski who has a host of Funny or Die shorts and the HBO tennis comedy ""7 Days in Hell"" under his belt but his feature debut doesnt prove that he can handle multiple storylines that are intended to stretch beyond a few minutes. This movie will leave you with many more questions than answers. Such as If Mike and Dave ruin every family party why would their family think asking them to bring dates is going to remedy the situation? Thats literally doubling the trouble. Furthermore why do drunken train wrecks Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) and Alice (Kendrick) want to be their dates? Sure its a free vacation to Hawaii but they have to go to great lengths to convince the guys that theyre ""nice girls"" when theyre actually mentally unstable drug addicts. And after all that why do they quickly and cavalierly confess their lies halfway through the movie fizzling out all the tension?Plaza and Kendrick pull the short straws in the character department and their performances dont help. The bizarre ""urban"" accent Plaza puts on as Tatiana is confounding and borders on offensive. Someone needs to stage an intervention with her representation. This is her second strike after the abomination that is ""Dirty Grandpa."" (Efron also has blood on his hands for that one.)Kendrick indulges her worst tendencies of quirky grating affectations. Heres an Oscar nominee in a movie where she covers her breasts with a horses mane during a drug trip for crying out loud. But trying to puzzle out the complicated sexual and gender politics here would be an exercise in futility.Efron usually elevates everything with his sweet stupidity but he gets only a few moments to shine as Dave. Adam Devine is vein-poppingly intense and ridiculous as Mike and squeezes in a laugh or two when hes allowed to be his weirdest. There are some comic high points Alice Wetterlunds butch bisexual cousin Terry is second only to Sam Richardson as the groom who knows no equal when it comes to playing endearingly nerdy fussbudgets. But on the wildly uneven rollercoaster that is ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" the lows far outweigh the highs.

Not nearly as subversive or exhilaratingly rude as 2005s Wedding Crashers (already a cringe-comedy classic) this similar romp takes the earlier movies best joke--Isla Fishers secretly wild party girl--and turns it into the main course. Brociferous man-children Mike (Adam Devine shouty) and Dave (Zac Efron pouty) may require dates for their younger sisters destination wedding as their dad demands of them. But its Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) who steal away the brothers story. Frequently drunk and proudly unkempt the female roomies home in on the gents all-expenses-paid trip to Hawaii (an offer that goes viral) by pretending to be good girls. That turns out to be particularly hard for them and the film shines when its powered by the expert comic wattage of its second-billed stars. (Alice and Tatiana need a new title.) Raiding their own wardrobes they discover they lack nonscandalous undergarments; Plaza whos long possessed the iciest stare in stand-up leans into her characters phony teaching career while Kendrick is finally free of her Pitch Perfect primness dropping ecstasy with the bride. You never quite believe these women belong with Devine and Efrons Hollywood-generic douche bags--it feels like a failure of the script if not the entire industry. Regardless Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates follows a sturdy trajectory toward incipient maturity (and ceremonial catastrophe). If you dont think about it too hard you wont hate it.

Courtesy of 20th Century Fox A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Sometimes a movie seems like it was more fun to make than it is to watch. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is one of those movies.Zac Efron and Adam DeVine are Dave and Mike Stangle two troublemaking brothers with a knack for walking the tightrope of party-makers/breakers. With their little sis Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) getting hitched in Hawaii to Eric (Sam Richardson) Mom and Dad (Stephanie Faracy and Stephen Root) demand the bros bring wedding dates to keep the firework-laden chaos at bay. After a short public and anticlimactic search they select Alice and Tatiana (Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza) two ""strong independent women"" (read hot messes) to be their plus-ones.Alice reels from being left at the altar -- a scene shes got on video and watches over and over for some reason -- and Tatianas a high-functioning alcoholic who dons an accent like shes been studying up on J.Lo interviews from when she was still on the block. The two are master enablers a shoplifting unshowered ""you do you"" pair who try to be ""good girls"" for the guys -- but obviously fail.Alice is the better-drawn of the two perhaps because shes given a past and fears and tics that shell inevitably run headfirst into or act on while Tatianas just crude and ... there. Its not for lack of trying or talent with these two; when theyre given time to connect with one another relax and get past the jokes on the page theres some magic. Kendrick is especially strange. When she attempts to explain hedge funds to the guys to convince them shes not an unemployed wreck she nonsensically scats buzzwords from Fannie Mae to Bernie Mac her doe eyes selling the dumbfounded naivete. When Tatiana briefs Alice on how to devise her good-girl character she asks ""What do you like to do?"" No hesitation ""Drink."" But too often the jokes are low-hanging fruit divorced from the situations these characters find themselves in.The same can be said for Dave and Mike. Efron and DeVine are like brothers from another mother with DeVine doing his characteristic over-the-top short-fuse humor and Efron mimicking the energy. As with Efrons and well-deserved hit Neighbors 2 earlier this year hes at his best when playing the dumb-but-good-hearted type convincingly shocked and stupefied (not to mention gullible) when Alice tells him her ex-fiance died of both cancer and AIDS before dying a third time in a plane crash. His straight(er)-man schtick provides much-needed counterbalance to DeVines ADHD but about half the time these two are on the screen together theyre advancing the plot with perfunctory hamstrung comedy that has to get from point A to point B ignoring some esoteric riffing moments we get to see in the blooper reel at the end that could have spiraled the whole thing into some out-there fun. EXPAND Wedding crashers Courtesy of 20th Century Fox One of those cut scenes has Dave and Mike crying coming to terms with what shitty selfish people they are and the spirit of his own words so moves Mike that he salutes and starts singing the national anthem with tears in his eyes. Yeah sure were not supposed to talk about the blooper reel because it didnt make the final cut but maybe dont show us all the weird good stuff at the end to remind us of what could have been.Throughout it seems as though the writers (Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien of the Neighbors franchise) are out of their depth with so many characters and so much story to get through -- this is a long destination wedding. The pacing is out of whack plodding in some spots and not lingering long enough on the crescendo when the quartet of misfits finally realize who they are and act on it. Theres some cookie-cutter rom-com writing and direction going on (a lot less com than uninspired rom) especially in scenes between Dave and Alice. You have to wonder if the studio steered them in a more traditional path but no matter who made the final decision it wasnt a good one.It might be unfair to judge this film against Neighbors or Neighbors 2 but its difficult not to when those two movies form the bulk of these writers careers. Unfortunately for them they didnt have the same seasoned feature director (Nicholas Stoller) at the helm on Mike and Dave nor a master cinematographer (Brandon Trost) to really distinguish the looks and heighten the scenes. Director Jake Szymanski is a veteran with shortform content but hes a little out of his league at feature length unable to hold all the threads together long enough to tie off the ends.Szymanski gets a few good performances but his supporting cast -- which includes Root Richardson Kumail Nanjiani Jake Johnson Marc Maron and Erik Griffin -- just isnt made use of beyond Alice Wetterlund whos got a great few lines as Cousin Terry a bisexual one-upper who as helpfully pointed out by Mike looks like if Don Johnson fucked Zack Morris. Unfortunately Mike and Dave will probably be known for what it could have been more than what it is a marriage of talents that cant make it past the honeymoon.

Id call Mike a Boy-Man but hes not even that mature; hes supposed to be naive and somewhat dimwitted but he registers as closer to brain-damaged. Lets call him a Baby-Man. Hes been pursuing his wedding date the reprobate Tatiana who is way too much woman for him for the past hour. That shes finally given in is supposed to be ""fun."" Heres the shot Mike lies on his back on a hay bale. His legs are in the air. Tatiana - skirt hiked up bare bum exposed - is standing over him thrusting. Shes screwing him get it? Shes the guy Hilarious right? To drive the point home Mike even says ""I didnt know you could do it this way.""My heart which had already sunk to my ankles sank through the floor. Is this the best we can do for a comedienne as devilish and intelligent as Plaza? (Sure thats likely a butt double but audiences wont care.) To see her in that utterly compromised position - and Im talking about the whole film here not just this shot - is as appalling as the grossest horror porn. Its a sight I wish I could unsee.I would call this whole exercise dispiriting except Im pretty sure its intended audience wouldnt understand that word.Written by Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien and directed by first-timer Jake Szymanski its based on a true (ish) story (ish) about two brothers - Zac Efron plays Dave Mikes protective slightly less stupid sibling - who advertise on Craigslist for nice girls to take to their little sister Jeanies (Sugar Lyn Beard) insanely lavish wedding in Hawaii. Perpetual screw-ups they hope this scheme will get them back into their familys good graces.Youll never guess what happens though - it backfires Tatiana and her bestie Alice (Anna Kendrick who also deserves much better) party girls who cant keep a job pose as a teacher and a banker to cadge a free vacation (though its unclear what they need a vacation from) and they whip up even more chaos than the brothers. Ecstasy is consumed horses are freed from corrals fireworks misfire. The bride gets smacked in the face with an ATV tire and then receives a porny massage that goes on so long youll be begging for a release yourself - from the theatre. Most dispiriting was the audience who seemed to find it all hysterical. Sigh.I did sit up at the one-hour mark though during the so-called dark night of the soul when the four main characters briefly feel sad enough about the havoc theyve wrought to ponder their flaws. Earnestly they bond over realizations like these from Tatiana ""Were always telling each other were awesome when were definitely not being awesome"" and ""Occasionally we should think about how we make other people feel.""For a nanosecond I was intrigued - could this movie be secretly radical? Is the relentless idiocy of its characters actually a subversive poke at the glorification of stupidity or a withering comment on narcissism?Nope. Turns out that the learning and growing was just a set-up for Tatiana to exclaim ""[Expletive deleted] me in the dick""You may think Im being too hard on this film. Its possible I saw it on the wrong night in the wrong mood. But Im fed up with the cheap laziness of this strain of comedy. When I was eight I found it side-splitting that Kens doll hand was moulded in a curve that fit perfectly over Barbies breast. But then I grew up.

Suddenly ""Snapchat The Movie"" is looking like fertile creative ground.Zac Efron and Adam DeVine play the Stangle brothers life of the party-types who act like frat house goofuses when in big crowds. In an effort to get them to cool down their parents beg them to line up dates for their sisters upcoming wedding. They turn to Craigslist since everything they do is a big gag and start ""interviewing"" candidates.The movies flip on its premise in that the brothers find two girls who are equally as crazy as them. But ""crazy"" is difficult to define when everything is this thinly written so in walk Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) and Alice (Anna Kendrick) two bong-ripping ""Broad City"" types who are scamming the guys to get a free trip to Hawaii. Jokes on Mike and Dave Or something?""Mike and Dave"" is a composite of other movies youve already seen; ""Wedding Crashers"" is an obvious antecedent so much so that the main characters note the similarities to it on screen.The movie goes for a bawdy ""outrageous"" vibe and big laughs which it lands less than half the time. The roles are so broadly written -- ""SNL"" characters have more depth -- that its impossible to care about anyone or the situations theyre in.""Mike and Dave"" is like being stuck with a bad wedding date.

Stephanie Zacharek szacharek July 7 2016 SHARE 20th Century Fox Adam Devine and Zac Efron in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. The men might claim the movies title but its the women who are key If summer is the time for anything its the time for refreshingly unprogressive comedies like Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. Like most modern comedies Mike and Dave arrives with a not wholly invaluable lesson tacked on at the end You might sum it up as ""Be nice Dont be a jerk"" But the movies real value is that its crude and funny for no defensible reason. As the audience herded out of the screening I attended mostly in good spirits one guy said shakily to his companion ""Im not sure about that movies gender politics."" Of course not But even if youve completely lost your taste for bro comedy--and Mike and Dave fits pretty squarely in the genre--theres at least one good reason to steel yourself and venture forth the dazzling chaos that is Aubrey Plaza. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates--directed by newcomer Jake Szymanski--is based sort of on the story of real-life brothers Mike and Dave Stangle who earned temporary ubiquity of the viral sort in 2013 when they took out a Craigslist ad seeking dates for a cousins wedding. (The bride didnt want them ""harassing"" her friends all night.) Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) love to drink whoop it up and just generally be dudes. When their younger sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard who has a voice that sounds like SweeTarts taste) announces that shes getting married the family insists they find dates for the wedding. Apparently their exuberant horseplay at family events generally ends in disaster. ""Were not party ruiners. Were party creators"" Dave insists but a montage of home movies showing renegade trampoline action and grandpas having heart attacks on the dance floor proves the familys point. So Mike and Dave concoct that ad ultimately receiving thousands of responses many from unsuitable candidates What they really want are ""nice"" girls who wont embarrass them and who though they dont spell this out will also sleep with them. Tatiana (Plaza) and Alice (Anna Kendrick) formerly waitresses at a vaguely Hooter-ish bar (theyve just lost their jobs for showing up drunk) are broke and exhausted and they need a vacation. They see the ad but sadly acknowledge that theyre highly unsuitable candidates. And so Tatiana hatches a plan to rebrand herself and Alice as the nice girls Mike and Dave want. They discard their droopy revealing T-shirts for puffy girly dresses tone down their streaky makeup and tame their bad-gal hair into something more polished and selfie-ready. It tells you something that just days after seeing Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates I remember very little about Efron and Devine Theyre fine. They make their characters seem vaguely endearing in that clueless-guy way. But their faces their bodies the way they load their figurative slingshots with jokes and let em rip--none of that has stuck. Its the women who are key. As Alice Kendrick has the vaguely zonked demeanor of the young Laraine Newman. Shes a sweet yet weirdly sharp space-case who at the duos first meeting with Mike and Dave poses as a hedge-fund manager. (""So theres a regular fund. And theres a hedge fund..."") She turns out to be a great sidekick not just for Plazas Tatiana but also for Beards Jeanie a darling bride-to-be whos something of a pawn to almost everyone around her--Alice plus a tab of Ecstasy helps opens her eyes. As Jeanie Beard is winsome and just a little nuts. Even if the movie doesnt serve her character as well as it could (especially when she becomes the victim of an absurd ATV mishap) Beard adds the right amount of vinegar to her cutie-pie earnestness. But if this is anyones show its Plazas. Plaza is a possible comic genius who hasnt had a movie role worthy of her since Maggie Careys raw and wickedly funny 2013 The To-Do List in which she played a sexually naive young woman who prepares for her first year of college by drawing up a list of girls-gone-wild goals for herself. That picture in addition to being hilarious wrestled with the idea that while young women are always told that they need to take charge of their sexuality no one ever warns them about the impossibility of understanding human desire. Mike and Dave takes the more common route of showing guys desperate efforts to get laid. (The women incidentally dont give in until theyre good and ready.) But Plaza is so funny and so defiant in her laid-back eye-rolling way that she practically sabotages the movie. When Tatiana shows up with Alice for that first meeting Devines Mike hardly Gods brightest bulb is instantly smitten. She plunks down orders a drink and then announces as if shed just remembered it ""Im a schoolteacher."" Simultaneously and smoothly she slips on a pair of owlish glasses and begins chewing on the pencil shes just pulled from her purse. Plazas Tatiana is dry and cool like a cucumber martini. Shes a bit cruel too--while Mike and Dave are hoping dopily for easy access she couldnt make her lack of interest in Mike any more obvious. Everyone is using everyone else in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Almost no one save bride-to-be Jeanie is particularly nice. But as Tatiana Plaza takes craven self-interest as well as vulnerability masquerading as confidence to new heights. Shes empowered all right. She also uses her empowerment as a cudgel--on the surface shes unlikable. And still you fall for her just as Mike does. The gender politics of Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates arent what youd call progressive. But the hard reality of movie comedies and of life is that progressive wont always get you a laugh. Sometimes it wont even get you a date. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Credit Gemma LaMana/20th Century Fox Film Corporation Two idiots need dates; they get them.Thats about all you need to know about the aggressively stupid ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" a would-be comedy about a pair of imbeciles who are best understood as representations of the enduring marrow-deep contempt that some moviemakers have always had for their audiences. Witless soulless often amateurish and filled with product placements (nice going Coors) the movie has nothing going for it other than some wasted talent. I hope that the most egregiously squandered -- the co-stars Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick as well as the character actors Stephen Root and Sam Richardson -- were well paid. Somebody needs to come out of this mess ahead. Video Movie Review Mike and Dave The Times critic Manohla Dargis reviews ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date July 7 2016. Photo by Gemma LaMana/Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. The story is immaterial and boilerplate. Adam Devine plays Mike; Zac Efron plays his brother Dave. Their parents -- knowing that their sons tend to ruin family events with their unfunny often dangerous bro-antics (in one flashback they send their grandfather to the grave) -- insist that they bring dates to their sisters nuptials. The brothers put an ad on Craigslist which is where Ms. Plaza and Ms. Kendrick come in. Anonymously directed by Jake Szymanski what follows isnt really a story just a succession of thuddingly leaden patchily strung together bits in service to the underlying theme Mike and Daves fear of sexualized women. Oh theres also a racist joke pegged to the singer Seal. Video Trailer Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Two hard-partying brothers try to get dates for a wedding by placing an ad on Craigslist. By 20th CENTURY FOX PICTURES on Publish Date February 12 2016. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed You could see ""Mike and Dave"" as the latest manifestation of white heterosexual male panic run amok. A throwaway line about heteronormativity (Im sure I heard that right) suggests that someone behind the scenes would like viewers to believe that theres a degree of self-awareness to all the desperation and yuks about booze babes and bros. Perhaps there is; whatever. But token reflexivity never got anyone off the hook. It certainly doesnt obscure the more resonant if completely predictable truth that the movie evinces a profoundly troglodytic worldview toward women. And while that says a lot about Mike and Dave it says even more about the industry that made this movie.""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Its bad for your brain. Running time 1 hour 45 minutes.

Built on a shaky comic premise based on a real Craigslist ad posted by a pair of party animals -- and smacked to life with relentlessly feeble dopey improvisation and unoriginal crudity -- ""Mike and Dave"" is more likely to tarnish its casts comedy-chops goodwill than to foster a desire to see any more raunch-till-you-drop yukfests. A slickly filmed slo-mo credit sequence shows sibling alcohol salesmen Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave Stangle (Zac Efron) as life-of-the-wingding revelers who can turn any family get-together into a people-pleasing affair with trampolines fireworks and costumes. But when their parents (Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy) soon-to-be-married sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) and her fiance Eric (Sam Richardson) show up at their city pad with a stern warning that they must bring dates to Jeanies wedding in Hawaii the brothers act shocked until theyre shown footage of their prior antics. See Video Zac Efron Adam Devine Get Played in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Red Band Trailer Its a nifty bait-and-switch gag The opening montage had been fantasy while the home video truth is that Mike and Dave routinely show up stag get drunk harass women wreak havoc and piss off everyone. (Its also an unfortunately ironic metaphor for what the movie eventually does as well.) That the solution is forcing these loose-cannon hedonists to bring ""respectable"" dates is flimsy enough. How would that ensure decorum exactly? That their big-idea viral ad offering two nice girls an all-expenses-paid travel date leads to so many terrible auditioners (the inevitable bad-meet montage of the weird the weirder and the not-female) is a stretch. That the two they get excited about -- Alice and Tatiana a pair of debauched waitresses pretending to be respectable career women and played by Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza -- cant be seen for the scheming immature trainwrecks they are is one leap too many. See Video Aubrey Plaza Roasts Mike and Dave Co-Stars Anna Kendrick Zac Efron and Adam Devine (Exclusive) Plenty of going-wrong comedies have been built on less but nothing in the screenplay by Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan OBrien (""Neighbors"" ""Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising"") suggests that anyone cared even a little bit about whether the set-up made any sense before the rude humor freight train left the station. And the crass-gag pileup is a well-worn one insults pain and sexual shenanigans. In the ""Jurassic Park"" hills of Hawaii the bride gets hit in the kisser by an airborne ATV tire which plays as an excuse for everyone to make fun of her face. Meanwhile sex or references to sex -- wanted unwanted obliged unforeseen taboo -- is everything to a movie like this aimed as it is at the most juvenile of gigglers. When Kendricks Alice feeling sorry about the brides accident pays a masseuse (Kumail Nanjiani) to give the unsuspecting Jeanie an extra level of attention it becomes an oiled naked happy-ending joke with too many endings none of them funny. Its the kind of movie in which stoned characters in proximity to a corral of horses is enough to induce shivers. (Thankfully nothing untoward happens.) Mostly though its the lame ad-libbing -- you can always see it coming too as when the bride reveals her scarred face -- that really suggests the improvisation crutch has become the comedy endurance-sport equivalent to the bloated non-stop CGI action that vacuums the thrills out of a summer blockbuster. Where winging it once felt like the seasoning in an absurdist Will Ferrell/Adam McKay movie or a bittersweet Judd Apatow romantic comedy now its the bland entree. Characters dont say dialogue that moves anything forward in these movies they spit off-the-cuff lines beat jokes into the ground and fill gaps with shrieking (especially the little-goes-a-long-way Devine). Under the rudderless direction of Jay Szymanski (HBOs ""7 Days in Hell"") all the improv renders any potentially viable comic situations tension-free and makes editing rhythms moot. (A moratorium on ""You look like [ad-lib]"" and ""[blank] is my bitch"" would be a good start.) Also Read Anna Kendrick Names Her Dream Marvel Role - And Its Nuts The cast members are already veterans of this type of thing but in Efrons case hes never seemed blander sidelined comedically by the huffing and puffing Devine and barely interested in the rubberstamped spark meant to bring Dave and Alice together. Kendrick meanwhile waffles between making the once-jilted-at-the-altar Alice a pinwheel-eyed loon or a wounded romantic. (Then again Alice is hardly a character to begin with.) Only ""Parks amp; Recreation"" alum Plaza offers the occasionally pleasurable deadpan impishness but the primary takeaway is that shes been to this well one too many times. On the supporting front Alice Wetterlund gamely plays a butch Stangle cousin who macks on Tatiana but again she seems to exist only so she can be called a ""bisexual Fonzie"" serve as an antagonist to Mike and initiate a coarse witless bit in a sauna. Like nearly every movie with a nuptial-themed title ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" ends with a ceremony and a rigged stab at character happiness. But the party vibe isnt contagious unless the signal that the dumbness has reached an end brings a welcome finally earned sense of relief.

I thought it should be grosser. I expected the bro-comedy to be full of material that would make my face turn red - either from embarrassment or giggles or both. But even its big comedic moments - often hinging on situations that should induce red face - dont go nearly as far as they could. The movie is more a series of loosely tied together scenes than a full-fledged movie. It wants to be Wedding Crashers but its not nearly as memorable smart or sweet. In a way Im glad that I dont have to watch Mike and Daves two extremely talented female stars Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect) and Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation) debase themselves too badly. But theyre so game and so great that its a shame they dont get to push the limits of their comedic personas. Adam DeVine (Workaholics) and Zac Efron on the other hand are used to debasing themselves on-screen. They play Mike and Dave respectively two brothers - based on real-life guys - who are required to find wedding dates to their younger sisters Hawaiian nuptials because they have a history of bad behavior at family gatherings (as seen in flashbacks). Enter Tatiana (Plaza) and Alice (Kendrick) two equally debaucherous women who decide to put on a good-girl facade in order to get themselves a free vacation. Chaos of course ensues as Mike and Dave figure out that their wedding lady friends arent the sweethearts they pretend to be. The upside? Kendrick and Plaza get to be just as stupid as DeVine and Efron. Theres no gendered division that says the men in the movie have the monopoly on being idiotic and therefore funny. And the entire cast is totally willing and able to do the ridiculous things they are called upon to do. The downside? These characters are not stupid enough. Mike and Dave never really feels like it has any momentum. Instead it relies on frat boy humor for a cheap laugh. It has its moments but they dont have much staying power. meichelphillynews.com215-854-5909mollyeichel Published July 7 2016 -- 258 PM EDT The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesnt contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Help us learn more about Philly.com commenters.

Bill Zwecker billzwecker | email Most of us likely have attended weddings where there are at least one or two wacky individuals -- perhaps obnoxious clowns is a better description -- who think the festivities just wouldnt be complete without their hilarious antics. Thats the underlying premise of the surprisingly engaging and very funny ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates."" Based on the true story of Mike and Dave Stangle the film stars Zac Efron and Adam Devine as the party-loving brothers who actually did advertise on Craigslist in an ill-fated ploy to find dates for their little sisters wedding. The impetus was Mike and Daves well-known reputation for ruining far too many parties and weddings -- thanks to their love of crazy stunts. Of course instead of snaring a couple of ""decent"" young ladies to squire to the nuptials the brothers are conned by a pair of women who love hard partying as much as the liquor salesmen Stangle boys -- but who simply want to glom on to a free vacation in Hawaii where the destination wedding is being held. Its the performances by Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick as the two ""dates"" that truly made this movie work for me. This is not great moviemaking by any stretch of the imagination but the spot-on comic timing of the principals here -- especially former ""Parks and Recreation"" star Plaza -- captured my funny bone and kept it happily working overtime from start to finish. In a summer that does not have much out there in the way of silly antic-packed comedies director Jake Szymanski -- best known for his TV work on shows like ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" -- has done yeoman work here delivering a very humorous if predictably paced film. Efron -- who of course HAS to showcase his killer bod in numerous shirtless scenes -- also demonstrates his continuing growth as a skilled comedic performer. I think the secret to his success as a funny guy comes from the intensity he brings to his on-screen persona. Hes so committed to some of the most ridiculous escapades it makes them seem even funnier than they otherwise would be. Devine is totally over-the-top which completely fits the character hes portraying the ultimate twentysomething who finds it impossible to leave behind the carefree often reckless times he spent as a rambunctious teen. That said I have to again go back to the strength of Plaza and Kendricks performances which add yet more impact to the realization that some of our best film comics today -- think Amy Poehler Tina Fey Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig -- are actresses who often outdo their male counterparts in delivering really really funny big-screen moments. A final side note which I found refreshing at a time when so much emphasis is being placed on the differences in our world -- whether it be dividing people by religion race or nationality. In the movie Mike and Daves sister Jeanie (played by Sugar Lyn Beard) is marrying Eric portrayed by Second City alum Sam Richardson. The good thing Not once is any reference made to the fact that Jeanie who is white is marrying an African-American. Very nice to see.  20th Century Fox presents a film directed by Jake Szymanski and written by Andrew Jay Cohen amp; Brendan OBrien. Running time 98 minutes. Rated R (for crude sexual content language throughout drug use and some graphic nudity). Opens Friday at local theaters.

Comments click to enlarge Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Video Rated R  98 minutes  2016 The title yahoos (Zac Efron Adam Devine) have wreaked havoc at so many family gatherings that their fed-up father (Stephen Root) bans them from their sisters impending nuptials unless they bring dates and behave themselves; after Mike and Dave appear on a TV talk show to recruit them (which the family somehow never hears about) they land a couple of live ones (Anna Kendrick Aubrey Plaza) who cause more chaos at the event than they do. The chirpy Kendrick and baleful Plaza make a better comic team than the interchangeably dumb Efron and Devine and giving the women equal time with the men elevates what might otherwise have been a simple knockoff of Wedding Crashers. But any such novelty is undercut by the dull certainty that like the earlier movie this one will end with a joyous ceremony and a validation of marriage. Mike and Dave may need wedding dates but the producers need a date movie. Jake Szymanski directed. By J.R.

Photo Gemma LaMana. MOVIE REVIEW MIKE AND DAVE NEED WEDDING DATES Running time 98 minutes. Rated R (sex nudity profanity crude and raunchy humor). Just as theres room for more than one movie about superheroes theres room for more than one movie about attending weddings under false pretenses. The frankness in ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" is refreshing The characters even talk about how much they love ""Wedding Crashers."" Who doesnt? This time theres a sly difference Its the girls Alice and Tatiana (Anna Kendrick Aubrey Plaza) who arent supposed to be there. They con their way into an elaborate destination wedding in Hawaii that they treat as an all-expenses-paid vacation. Both are trashy waitresses who contrive a meeting with two brothers Mike and Dave Stangle (Adam DeVine Zac Efron) who published a viral post seeking ""nice girls"" to be their dates for their sisters wedding their dad (Stephen Root) having chewed them out for constantly ruining previous family events they attended stag. Having female companionship the reasoning goes will civilize the anarchic young bros. Disconcerting as it is to see such shrewd actresses as Kendrick and Plaza play brainless skanks they hit their marks with gusto and a little sweetness In keeping with the overall vibe of seeming like a production of Judd Apatows slightly less thoughtful little brother the picture (directed by Jake Szymanski of HBOs ""7 Days in Hell"") is as filthy as the back of a sanitation truck -- but it has heart too. Most of the comedy is funny some of it is hilarious and even the scenes that dont really work (such as the bizarre nude massage that amounts to the centerpiece of the film) have so much crazy energy that you have to give them credit for the effort. Drugs public nudity unfortunate ATV accidents a horny lesbian cousin and poorly aimed fireworks add to the vortex of nuttiness but the movie also randomly comes up with clever insights like a bit on how men find schoolteachers attractive. In Tatianas case though she sounds a bit too honest to be the second-grade teacher she pretends to be ""The key to teaching kids is repetition"" she declares. ""Youd be surprised how stupid they are."" Nor can Alice quite be believed when she says her ex died of cancer AIDS and a plane crash. Some of the dumbest bits (and there are many) dont fail completely because of the talents of the actors especially DeVine whose line readings throughout are sensational. And as befits a movie containing stars of ""High School Musical"" and ""Pitch Perfect"" there is singing not to mention wonderfully unpredictable little bits of random seemingly improvised comedy Consider the priceless line ""Once I got high on peyote and signed up for a T-Mobile plan.""

"In Mike and Dave ladies steal the bro show review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesIn Mike and Dave ladies steal the bro show reviewAnna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza are the best thing about stoner comedy Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. July 7 2016Mike and Dave Need Wedding DatesStarring Anna Kendrick Aubrey Plaza Adam DeVine and Zac Efron. Directed by Jake Szymanski. 98 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. 14ABuffoon brothers Mike (Adam DeVine) and Dave (Zac Efron) get the title credit in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. But this exuberantly crass comedy gets its mojo courtesy of their female alter egos Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza as two hard-partying free spirits who rock these chronically misbehaving sibs worlds.Droll tough gal Tatiana (Plaza) and Kendrick as her rarely sober bestie Alice (not long ago ditched at the altar and pretty messed up about it) are both blessed with great comic chops and the most fun to watch here.Article Continued BelowBased on the real-life story of the Stangle siblings whose Craigslist ad for family-acceptable wedding dates to their sisters nuptials went viral there are some solid laughs even if most of it rings familiar.Adam DeVine and Zac Efron right have their moments in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates but its Aubrey Plaza left and Anna Kendrick who are the most fun to watch.  (GEMMA LAMANA / TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX)  Wedding Dates would love to be a millennial Wedding Crashers (theres even a reference made) but the script from Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien (the Neighbors franchise) doesnt quite get there sticking to an occasionally weary-making bombardment of mayhem dirty jokes and wise-assery.Sister Jeanie (Torontos Sugar Lyn Beard the helium-voiced former YTV host known as Suga BayBee) insists the man-boys have the calming influence of ""nice girl"" dates when she marries Eric (Sam Richardson) in paradise.Its with good reason. Mike (DeVine a Grade A ham) and Dave (Efron repeating his still-funny overgrown frat boy shtick) spend much of their time doing dumb stuff and looking triumphant about the results.They land on The Wendy Williams Show to plead for dates. Its irresistible to bad seeds Tatiana and Alice who are up to the challenge of playing respectable girls if it means a free trip to Hawaii.To the guys horror the sweet teacher and hedge fund manager they take to Hawaii as parent-pleasing dates turn out to be them -- on steroids.First-time director Jake Szymanski gets trapped in the more-is-more cycle of piling on gross gags and manic overconsumption but in between he comes up with some solid laughs especially a brilliantly funny bit from Kumail Nanjiani as Jeanies anxious-to-please New Age masseuse Keanu.Tatiana and Alice eventually do some growing up discovering they have other gifts beyond getting high and ruining everything. As for Mike and Dave theyre destined to be idiots forever. Change doesnt happen overnight.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

This movie will make you reconsider.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune July 7 2016 -- 142pm 20th Century Fox Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) plan to turn their sisters wedding into a wild getaway. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint If you told a couple of stoners to write a screenplay while listening nonstop to the Black Eyed Peas ""My Humps"" -- you remember the hip-hop duet between will.i.am and Fergie about her ""lovely lady lumps"" -- theyd produce something like ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates."" Its asinine in an almost irresistible way. The film has an unapologetically dirty mind except when it seems to have no mind at all which is frequent. This pandering butt-stupid sex comedy is a burlesque of wedding movies that is 100 percent crude and nearly as funny. It doesnt just objectify the female form; it takes a hatchet to all of humanity and some animal species too. Watching it is like having an excited puppy gleefully grind against your leg for 98 minutes. Its gross and annoying but at some point you have to laugh surrender your moral dignity and concede its a lovable scamp. The title characters are hard-partying bros Mike and Dave Stangle jocks who share the unfortunate curse of stupidity. Played rather gamely by Adam DeVine and Zac Efron they are the kind of lowbrow fun-seekers who will bound up on a trampoline to kiss a date standing a floor overhead without thinking about the consequences. When theyre reminded of such hijinks they whoop ""Yeah wasnt that unforgettable?"" The films stakes are quickly established when their sister invites them to her Hawaiian wedding provided they bring a pair of decent females to hold them in check. They quickly reconsider their misspent youths recruit sensible mature life companions and live happily ever after. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates  out of 4 stars Rating R for crude sexual content language throughout drug use and some graphic nudity. Just kidding. No they dont. Publicizing two free weeks in the Pacific with a Craigslist notice brings dozens of wannabe partners even more ludicrous than the brothers building to an extended transgender joke that is hysterically transgressive. Then the babelicious Tatiana and Alice (Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick) arrive. The utter bimbos impersonate desirable companions well enough to infatuate the none-too-bright brothers. Soon theyre all off to the land of leis each of the four giving that their own indecent interpretation. The film has a pile of sketches rather than a story but its a jubilant mess. Director Jake Szymanski turns these sex pests into lusty running gags. Efron and Kendrick slowly reveal romantic streaks but her mindless efforts to buddy up with bride-to-be Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) push the bachelorette into long pricelessly funny nude scenes veering over into porn parody. DeVine hopes to land Plaza who is none too interested. His ambitions are further thwarted when his cousin Terry (Alice Wetterlund) a fiery lesbian libertine wants to lasso his date. Their competition triggers endless scenes with nubile flesh on show and a dauntless commitment to smutty humor. The jokes are slap-you-in-the-face vulgar but so unashamedly over the top that theres much to enjoy here. The film is held back by no sense of shame whatever and to my surprise neither was my laughter.

Their parents force them to bring dates to their sisters wedding in Hawaii to make sure they behave. (20th Century Fox) Mike and Dave Stangle put the ""bro"" in brothers. Twenty-something liquor salesmen theyre the life of the party -- but also the death of it -- having turned a perfectly lovely Fourth of July fireworks spectacle into a conflagration while endangering innocent bystanders with over-the-top trampoline acrobatics. They just dont know when to say when. The movie theyre in is similarly afflicted. Starring Adam Devine and Zac Efron as the titular duo ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" is uproarious and flamboyantly raunchy utterly stupid yet also occasionally winning. Youll laugh but you might feel bad for doing it Amusement is a form of approval and do we really want to encourage such filth? Directed by Jake Szymanski the movie opens as Mike and Dave are preparing for the wedding of their beloved little sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) whos getting hitched to Eric (Sam Richardson) in Hawaii. Justifiably convinced that the brothers will ruin yet another classy affair Jeanie Eric and the elder Stangles (Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy) stage an intervention. For some reason the foursome thinks that female companions will keep the guys from their usual attention-seeking antics. Mike and Dave unenthusiastically agree to the terms. One viral Craigslist ad later and the brothers are barraged with emails from women hoping for a free beach vacation. Cue the predictable montage a parade of blind dates that all turn out to be duds in the extreme. The perfect formula for ruining a family gathering From left Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) and Alice (Anna Kendrick) hook up for an island getaway with brothers Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) in ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates."" (Gemma LaMana/Twentieth Century Fox) Just as the brothers are losing hope they hit the jackpot. Alice (Anna Kendrick) has a nice smile and runs a hedge fund and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) is a schoolteacher who makes a lavish display of sucking on a No. 2 pencil. Mike and Dave are too distracted by their good fortune to notice the red flags Alice doesnt actually know what a hedge fund is and Tatianas good-girl persona comes and goes. The four are soon headed to Hawaii for whats supposed to be a sedate wedding where everything goes according to plan. It turns out that Alice and Tatiana are actually recently fired waitresses who spend their days drinking smoking weed and getting into trouble. The two women are instigators setting off a series of events that include a bad Ecstasy trip a horse stampede and an ATV accident. Nothing says ""laugh riot"" like a near-fatal injury. Oddly enough the movie has a pseudo-feminist heart. The message which has all the subtlety of a slap to the face is that girls can be just as grotesque offensive and self-centered as guys. Its no surprise that screenwriters Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien also wrote ""Neighbors 2"" built on a similar premise. And yet the ladies arent nearly as amusing or interesting as their male counterparts. So much for equal opportunity. Alice is funny enough with her tendency to tell preposterous lies. But Tatiana is hard to take. Shes a selfish downer with few redeeming qualities and Plazas distractingly trashy accent -- a strenuous attempt to prove shes a bad girl deep down -- doesnt help. Efron who is well on his way to establishing his comedy chops doesnt disappoint as the hotter dumber Stangle. Devine meanwhile lands plenty of solid punch lines despite his default performance mode screaming. It gets old fast. Some of the best humor come from the supporting cast. During one especially hilarious sight gag Jeanie gets a massage from a therapist (Kumail Nanjiani) who strips down covers himself in oil and proceeds to give her the strangest most transcendent deep-tissue work you can possibly imagine. Except youd be wrong Its a perfect example of the movie doing what it does best. The movie doesnt really level the playing field for men and women. Its bizarre and vulgar but also too funny to resist. R. At area theaters. Contains crude sexual humor vulgar language throughout drug use and some graphic nudity. 98 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Video by Rob Schumacher Rob SchumacherZac Efron and Anna Kendrick star in a comedy about brothers who find wedding dates on Craigslist. Some laughs but no real heart.Its brotherly love between Dave (Zac Efron left) and Mike (Adam Devine) in ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates.""(Photo Gemma LaMana)Story HighlightsCritics rating 2 out of 5 starsI dont know why I feel the need to offer this disclaimer every time I dont like a stupid comedy but here goes I like stupid comedies.I like good stupid comedies. I dont like bad ones the same way I dont like bad dramas or horror movies. (Well I do have kind of a soft spot for bad horror.)I didnt much care for ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" director Jake Szymanskis film despite laughing a few times and genuinely liking all of the lead actors Zac Efron Adam Devine Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza. Theyve proven over time and several films and shows that they can be hilarious willing to do anything for a laugh.""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" features Aubrey Plaza (from left) Anna Kendrick Adam Devine and Zac Efron. (Photo Gemma LaMana)Maybe they shouldnt.Its the characters they play I dislike characters so selfish and self-centered that they kill what is supposed to be a party-hearty-and-be-redeemed vibe but instead comes off like idiots screwing up not only their own lives but the lives of those around them.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceMan does that sound heavy for what is clearly meant to be a laugh? But the movie about two neer do well brothers who advertise for wedding dates on Craigslist is based on a real-life event. That doesnt make it better or worse just weird that someone would actually do that.Efron and Devine play Dave and Mike Stangle brothers and bros who havent amount to much in life with the exception of wrecking every family gathering they go to with their wild drinking dancing trampoline-jumping (why not) womanizing and ... you get the idea.Siblings Mike (Adam Devine left) and Dave (Zac Efron) plan to turn their sisters wedding into a wild getaway in ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates."" (Photo Gemma LaMana)But when their sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard always funny) announces she is getting married in Hawaii the family stages an intervention Dave and Mike will not be going stag to this event. No they will be escorting two respectable women who will in theory keep them in line.So naturally they turn to Craigslist. It turns into a moment the kind of story the media so often pursue now at the expense of you know wars and elections and stuff. And thats where Alice (Kendrick) and Tatiana (Plaza) see them on a TV news show as they lie on the couch nursing hangovers.An idea is born. A plan is hatched. A movie is set in motion.Basically thats the story -- they scheme so that Dave and Mike will select them. Spoiler alert They do. The foursome arrive in Hawaii with differing expectations which is to say Dave and Mike want sex while Alice and Tatiana want free booze and food and beach time.Its the wedding party in ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates."" Stephen Root (from left) Stephanie Faracy Sam Richardson Lavell Crawford Aubrey Plaza Adam Devine Zac Efron Anna Kendrick Sugar Lyn Beard Alice Wetterlund and Mary Holland. (Photo Gemma LaMana Gemma LaMana)Alice and Tatiana are free-spirited sorts especially when theyve been drinking (imagine). Some of the disasters they cause are pretty funny. Some are not. One in particular goes so far it seems as if there would be no coming back from it but hey its only a movie. Have another daiquiri and take some ecstasy. Its all cool.These are gifted comic actors so there are going to be laughs. Kendrick is terrific in whatever she does. Her comic timing is unmatched. Efron is a lot funnier in the ""Neighbors"" movies where his heart of gold seems more earned; theres some pain in there too.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestMaybe thats the problem here. A good stupid comedy doesnt have to have an abundance of brains (duh) but it should have some heart. The inevitable heart-of-gold bit isnt earned.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet One of the earliest jokes in Mike And Dave Need Wedding Dates is one of the movies cleverest. After a brief cold open the opening credits roll over images of brothers Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Zac Efron) Stangle engaging in flashy over-the-top partying antics lots of face-pulling and slow-motion backed by a bass-heavy party-hard pop song. A few minutes after the sequence ends the boys are confronted by their parents (Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy) sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) and her fiance Eric (Sam Richardson) about their tendency to ruin family gatherings with their codependent shenanigans and how they must tether themselves to calming dates for Jeanie and Erics upcoming wedding. To support their case they roll home-movie footage of the same gatherings glimpsed in the credit sequence the free-spirited good times now chased with injuries panicked screams and at least one explosion. Mike and Dave are aghast demanding to see the ""epic tracking shots of smiling faces"" that they remember. The gap between bros-will-be-bros goofiness and the human collateral in their wake is hilariously illustrated.There are many more jokes after that one delivered in a tizzy through a scenario so high-concept it almost goes back around to over-complicated. The Stangle brothers who live work and party together acquiesce to their familys demands and place an ad looking for ""nice girls"" to take to Hawaii for the wedding. The ad goes viral as the kids say and the boys wind up on TV (this is the truest part of a ""sort of"" true story from 2013 that inspired a quickie book and this movie) which is how their predicament reaches Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) and Alice (Anna Kendrick) a pair of hard-partying best friends who make it their mission to scam a free island vacation by pretending to be nice respectable parent-pleasing girls. With Tatiana and Alice pretending to be the types of girls that Mike and Dave pretend to want and all four capable of having ""fun"" to the detriment of others the movie raises some interesting questions about self-deception. To what degree are these four people defined by what theyre imitating? The movies clear influences add another layer of imitation Efron and Devines immature teamwork suggests that theyve been watching Step Brothers a lot while Kendrick and Plaza act like theyve been studying Tina Fey. Plaza in particular spends at least the first half-hour of the movie saying most of her lines in Feys mock-confident voice used sarcastically on 30 Rock and more sincerely as the alcoholic therapist on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Credited screenwriters Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien worked on the Neighbors series but they also crib from Wedding Crashers to the extent that the Stangles refer to the movie and a specific plot point directly.The unevenness of that last one nonwithstanding these are not bad things to copy and the performers are more than capable of pulling off homages to better material. Kendrick whose character is haplessly nursing a broken heart and Plaza who is more of an all-purpose schemer are particularly charming in their freedom to act like dummies and subvert the usual ""nice girl"" of a wedding-centric romantic comedy. Efron doesnt reach Neighbors levels of inspiration but he does finally give a performance that lands between those peaks and his frequent puppy-himbo valleys--hes funny and a semi-credible romantic lead opposite Kendrick. He also functions as a restrained relief next to Devine who spends a lot of time screaming and sputtering a human scattershot.Its hard to blame Devine for committing so hard and so loud; the movies whole comic style is wildly undisciplined. Its also not ineffective. Director Jake Szymanski doesnt bring much visual flair to the proceedings (despite a background in the visual mimicry of HBOs 7 Days In Hell and some Saturday Night Live filmed pieces) mostly falling back on an overuse of slow-motion pop-scored strutting. (At least some of the music choices are solid; Kendrick and Plazas confidence accompanied by blasts of ""Kids"" by Sleigh Bells is pretty irresistible.) But this movie never aims for classical farce; it involves instead lots of fast talking references to outrageous moments from the characters pasts and micro-riffs in the vein of a modern comedy aiming for first-tier Rogen/Goldberg but happy to settle for a second-tier episode of New Girl. When the movie goes after bigger comic set pieces than improv-friendly ""you look like..."" runs (e.g. ""you look like burn-victim Barbie"") it tends to get a little dodgy as with a long sequence of weird sexually tinged slapstick at a spa. The frenetic verbal humor bouncing off all of the self-reflection over who the characters are hurting with their various codependent shenanigans produces something like a millennial echo chamber complete with Jurassic Park and Ninja Turtles references. This might well sound like a nightmare to non-millennial non-bros. But theres something liberating about a comedy where all four central characters fuck up with such youthful bravado. A more focused comedy might have treated the opening contrast as an inspired jumping-off point rather than a general theme--and crafted more jokes that linger rather than dissipating as soon as they land. But Mike And Daves crudeness of form and content is in its own way likably expressive.

EntertainmentMovies Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates -- and a new script Originally published July 7 2016 at 1201 am Updated July 7 2016 at 1251 pm Review of ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" Comedy is ""Wedding Crashers"" ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Hangover"" rolled into one just more forgettable. Rating 2 out of 4 stars Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic The on-screen words ""Based on a true story sort of"" kick off ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" a movie inspired by an incident that sounds a) like somebody made it up and b) like it should have already been a movie. Mike and Dave Stangle are an actual pair of New York-area bros who in 2013 placed a Craigslist ad looking for dates for a family wedding. From this jovial ad came not actual dates (they ended up going with a pair of women they already knew) but TV appearances a book deal a publicist and a movie adaptation with Adam Devine and Zac Efron as the title characters. This is to put it mildly more than most of us find on Craigslist. And the resultant movie is like a lot of weddings sporadically fun draggy in spots ultimately forgettable. In the Hollywood version of events two hard-partying sardonic women named Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) decide to masquerade as perfect dates in order to get a free trip to Hawaii (where the destination wedding will take place). Off they go greeted with glee by Mike and Daves family -- but as Alice soon groans ""Being a good girl is haaaard."" Director Jake Szymanski appears to have watched ""Wedding Crashers"" ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"" carefully coming up with a movie thats similar to them yet not as good. Youve seen this cheery slapdash blend of raunch cocktails and summer dresses before. Efron and Devine agreeably yell most of their lines. Kendrick and Plaza intone theirs in goofy deadpan and the story unfolds like ... wait theres no actual story here just an incident stretched out. Getting a laugh or two with a talented cast is easy; making a good movie it turns out is haaaard. Movie Review    Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates with Zac Efron Anna Kendrick Adam Devine Aubrey Plaza Stephen Root Stephanie Faracy Sugar Lyn Beard Sam Richardson Alice Wetterlund. Directed by Jake Szymanski from a screenplay by Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien. 98 minutes. Rated R for crude sexual content language throughout drug use and some graphic nudity.

Seeing an unfunny trailer and realizing this is absolutely as good as the movie is going to get. The setup for ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" is right in the title Two super-bro brothers have a history of partying so hard they end up wrecking every family event theyre at. So their kid sister lays down the law At her wedding theyre going to bring dates a couple of nice girls wholl keep them in line. Except the ""nice girls"" the dudes impulsively bring turn out to be kindred cut-ups who see this destination wedding as a chance to party til they drop. And then get up and party some more. Its a far-fetched concept (at one point the guys search for dates gets them booked on the Wendy Williams show) but the crude mood its going for is clear A mix of ""The Hangover"" ""Bridesmaids"" ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and especially ""The Wedding Crashers."" But if thats what youre trying for there are a few things you need to do. Be funny. Be filthy. And be fast. ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates""? No what Mike and Dave really need are bigger and better jokes. Its not that the filmmakers dont understand the genre. Director Jake Szymanski comes out of TV sketch comedy and online videos; hes good at quick bits and giving improv artists room (a plus when you have Aubrey Plaza on board). But a feature-length comedy demands different skills and their absence here is felt. Conversations are edited clumsily or scenes go on too long. There are a lot of cardboard characters and lazy stereotypes. And mostly there simply arent enough good gags. MORE In new films sisterhood is funny It helps that theres a quartet of strong uninhibited performers. Zac Efron continues to milk the Dumb Hunk bit ceding most of the rubber-faced comedy to Adam DeVine; the hardworking Anna Kendrick plays drunk but mostly nice letting Plaza do the heavy lifting as her coldly carnal best friend. It seems like an odd choice at first - why not let Efron and Kendrick really get their freak on too? - but soon it makes a dull sort of sense when you realize the movies cast the pretty Efron and sweet Kendrick as the storys main romantic couple; the goofy DeVine and unconventionally striking Plaza are strictly sidekicks. The problem as in almost all Hollywood rom-coms is that the supporting players end up being more interesting than the leads and yet getting less time on screen. Thats too bad because both performers are particularly good at being in the moment and Plaza is turning into kind of a comic MVP - a saucer-eyed cynic with a deadpan delivery and a filthy mind. She jazzes up any movie shes in and you wish this movie had given her more space. And given everyone more jokes. ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" has a couple of good laughs an unabashed view of female sexuality and at least avoids the usual bodily function jokes. Plaza is terrific and the Hawaiian locations are lovely (and more convincing than the pseudo New York ones). But for a movie about a wedding it still feels like a rehearsal. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations brief nudity substance abuse and violence. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (R) Fox (98 min.) Directed by Jake Szymanski.

Area theaters. Zac Efron is taking another crack at raunchy R-rated comedy in ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" a movie where the title doubles as the plot. Loosely based on the viral ad for wedding dates posted on Craigslist by real-life brothers Dave and Mike Stangle (played by Efron and ""Pitch Perfect"" star Adam Devine) the film takes a simple idea and expands it into a full-blown high-concept comedy. Not surprisingly its written by the duo behind ""Neighbors"" who helped Efron transition his ""High School Musical"" fame into comedy two years ago. For the movie the Stangles are offering an all-expenses-paid trip to their younger sisters wedding in Hawaii getting thousands of replies from eager women (and at least one man). Drunken party girls Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) decide they can win it by posing as nice girls and persuading the guys to pick them... and it works At first all four characters are incredibly annoying essentially yelling and swearing and being obnoxious so its natural to wonder if its possible to deal with them for a whole movie. Theres a good reason why R-rated comedies like ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""Bridesmaids"" have been so popular and thats because weddings as a rule tend to be prone to hilarious chaos. That may be why the movie only really starts to get going when the foursome arrives in Hawaii. Although its Mike and Daves names in the title this movie really is a brilliant showcase for Kendrick and Plaza giving them a chance to make up for several bad comedies theyve made this year. Theres a certain level of genius and skill in the way Plaza plays wild girl Tatiana as she pretends to be shy and demure but also remains aggressive enough to lead Mike on and get her way. Kendricks Alice is trying to get over being left at the altar and once at the wedding the ceremony sets off all her anxieties. Unlike Tatiana shes actually attracted to Dave... maybe he looks like Efron when he takes off his shirt. (Spoiler alert) Anna Kendrick (from l.) Zac Efron Adam Devine and Aubrey Plaza star in ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates."" Efron meanwhile ably takes on the role of the comedic straight man to both the ladies and to Devine whose Jack Black schtick can get tiring. Director Jake Szymansjki a veteran of ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Funny or Die"" proves himself a worthy comedy director being able to get the most laughs out of simple gags like the brides face connecting with a runaway ATV. He also has other secret weapons Sugar Lyn Beard gets some of the worst abuse as the boys little sister Jeanie while Stephen Root is perfect as the boys father and Alice Wetterlund shines as their competitive cousin Terry. None of them are quite as hilarious as ""Silicon Valley"" star Kumail Nanjiani who steals the entire movie during a spa session scene with the bride. (Remember Steve Carells chest-waxing scene in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin? Its that funny.) Surrounding the four leads with such funny characters and the situations created by throwing them all together gives this film a passing resemblance to ""Wedding Crashers."" As the romance between Efron and Kendricks characters blossoms the movie heads into some cliched territory but the foursomes character growth makes up for the movies grueling first 20 minutes. As dumb as ""Mike and Dave"" can get its a surprisingly fun summer comedy and icing on the (wedding) cake for fans of the raunchiest of humor.

TWITTER 7/8/2016 Zac Efron and Adam DeVine star with Anna Kendrick and Aubrey Plaza in this comedy loosely based on the antics of real-life brothers Mike and Dave Stangle. In the inevitably inebriated sometimes stoned reliably raw and occasionally bodily-fluid-enhanced annals of gross-out wedding comedies (a list arguably topped by The Hangover Bridesmaids and Wedding Crashers) Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates rates medium on the grossness scale (an all-body pre-marital naked-Indian-guru-administered massage for the bride with a happy ending anyone?) and pretty high in crude talk. But its kind of a dud when it comes to endurance and imaginative moves. The amusing premise of naughty-boy brothers who troll online for dates to their sisters Hawaiian nuptials only to end up with two babes far more foul than they delivers enough raunch to satisfy its intended good-times-seeking audience. Still the repetitive humor is frat boy-level boorish rather than cosmically anarchic suggesting a quick box-office cash-in instead of a big long haul for Fox in a summer thus far very short on comedy. Loosely based on the antics of real-life brothers Mike and Dave Stangle whose adventures advertising for dates on Craigslist led to TV appearances and a book this frantic almost desperately vulgar farce panders to its intended audience by following the simple formula of making sure nearly every sentence features three or four dirty words rather than one or two. For a while the overkill is somewhat amusing especially when the gals show up and outdo the guys. But when this is basically the only comic stratagem youre bound to hit the wall sooner rather than later. Having ruined previous family events with their antics (helpfully glimpsed in some raucous home videos) Mike (Adam Devine of Workaholics Modern Family and the two Pitch Perfect features) and Dave (Zac Efron) are commanded by their elders to get actual dates to accompany them to the upcoming wedding of their squeaky-voiced sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard). Despite their ad going viral and attracting 6000 responses the boys end up with two young ladies of genuinely bottomless vulgarity classlessness and lack of self-esteem. However the almost permanently sloshed Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) can still recognize a gravy train when they see one and they manage to climb on board without for once getting prone even before the double ""date"" is underway. ""Being a nice girl is hard"" complains Alice whos still reeling after having been jilted at her wedding. But she and born hard-ass Tatiana have agreed not to capitulate before Jeanies wedding so you can just about feel screenwriters Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan OBrien (former Judd Apatow cohorts best known for the two Neighbors features) scouring around trying to figure out what their boys and girls can do to create mayhem without doing the nasty. The foursomes first outing is a wild ATV ride across the Hawaiian landscape where the dinosaurs first appeared in the original Jurassic Park except there are no reptiles this time only heedless nutjobs on wheels. Then comes Jeanies deluxe massage followed by a provocative steam room encounter in which Mike and Daves butch cousin Terry (Alice Wetterlund very good) takes great pleasure in getting somewhere with Tatiana before Mike does. But what fizz there is goes flat after about an hour as TV comedy director Jake Szymanski on his debut feature desperately tries to keep a few laughs coming while navigating toward a resolution without getting too pat or sappy. A thankless task it was. Although both the guys are very vigorously vulgar Efron has little choice but to play the straight man to Devines hyperactive stooge; the latter never lets up with his shameless gall giving Jerry Lewis a run for his money when it comes to making faces. Kendrick and Plaza are somewhat better company if only because their characters extremism is initially more surprising and both have more cards to play as performers. The fancy resort settings notwithstanding Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates has a very cheap look and it doesnt take long to realize that if Hawaii is to be the cinematic vacation destination seeing Forgetting Sarah Marshall again would have provided a far better time.

Its fair to say that anyone who goes to see ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" will expect a certain amount of bang (pun intended) for their buck. The movie after all has ""wedding"" in the title (which of course is designed to get you to think of ""Wedding Crashers"") and its got a poster that makes it look like its four lead characters are just waking up after a fraternity-bash bender from hell. The audience is sure to demand its quota of gross-out gags gratuitous nudity discombobulated druggie slapstick dialogue sprinkled with over-the-top raunch and at least one sequence in which a character we like gets seriously physically damaged. ""Mike and Dave"" offers all of that so no one should walk away too disappointed but the good news is that the movie while it rambles on a bit also has a gently nutty spirit that is often quite winning. Yes its a piece of product shaped by four decades worth of arrested-adolescent farce (going back to the granddaddy of bad-behavior comedy ""National Lampoons Animal House""). But when these kinds of movies work at all its not just because they offer cheerfully delinquent man-boys acting out new and improved ways to offend. Its because theyre comedies of behavior that capture a certain personality flavor of the moment. ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" does that nicely and one of the main reasons is that the men onscreen are no longer the only ones behaving badly. The women who used to be victims of this stuff or on the sidelines are now at the rowdy disheveled foul-mouthed center of it all and that just multiplies the highly agreeable possibilities for naughty nasty lunacy. And of course the movie is a love story Box office prospects look solid or better. Zac Efron likably blitzed but basically the straight man and Adam Devine (from the ""Pitch Perfect"" comedies) as a rubber-faced geek with a tenuous hold on reality are Dave and Mike Stangle brothers who run a business selling liquor wholesale. Theyre the lifelong screw-ups of their family so when the time comes to plan their sisters destination wedding at a resort in Hawaii theyre ordered to find respectable dates to bring along so that they dont ruin the event by hitting on every woman there. Their search for companions a nationwide ""contest"" that begins on YouTube and culminates in their appearance on ""The Wendy Williams Show"" is based on the true-life antics of the Stangle brothers who found 15 minutes of sleaze-fame by trolling for dates on Craigslist. But really thats all just designed to give the film a trivial up-to-the-minute hook. (If this were 1995 and Mike and Dave had found their dates via personal ads it would have been the same movie.) The joke is that the dates find them and that theyre even more disreputable than our wastrel-loser heroes. When we meet Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) theyre the worlds most inept waitresses bumbling around a restaurant in far-too-skimpy outfits. Theyre drunk but theyre not dumb. After seeing Mike and Dave on TV they decide they could use a free vacation and they figure out that the two guys are going to be deluged with unappealing opportunists. So they devise a way to win them over by arranging to meet them by ""accident"" and by coming on as ""nice girls."" Its here where the comedy really takes off. Aubrey Plaza who was so sharp playing a good girl pretending to be bad in ""The To Do List"" is even sharper playing a bad girl pretending to be good. Shes got a face made for deception -- shes like a devil doll eyebrows lowering with cunning -- and her line readings are killer. When she spits out a line like ""Were gonna flip the script and Bachelorette that s--"" shes like a hip-hop princess and when she says of Mike ""He looks like a funhouse mirror version of a better-looking dude but he is...just that dude"" the line works because you feel her joy in delivering it. She puts on big serious glasses to be Mikes date for the wedding pretending to be a school teacher and Plazas impersonation of a sweet kind soul is so acidly perfect that it brings to mind Gillian Flynns description in ""Gone Girl"" of all the fakery that goes into acting like the Cool Girl. Plaza delivers a satire of niceness and Kendrick who truly is playing a nice girl (just a dazed and confused one) provides a daffy stoned counterpoint to Plazas gloriously rude misanthropy. Next to these two Mike and Dave seem ordinary enough but beneath their presentable -- in Daves case model-hunky -- looks theyre the latest in a long line of characters stretching from Wayne and Garth to the heroes of ""Superbad"" and beyond who view all of reality through a warped media lens. Its as if everything that happened to them was something they were watching on television. Theres a very funny sequence in which the four characters go riding on dune bikes over the spectacular rolling green stretch of Hawaii where ""Jurassic Park"" was filmed and the issue of whos going to take a daring jump off a small cliff becomes a four-way contest of male-versus-female moxie. Mike starts out as the cowardly wimp -- until he decides to go for it which has unfortunate consequences for his sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) who winds up with a seriously bruised face right before the wedding. ""You look like burn-victim Barbie"" says Mike only ratcheting up the insensitivity by saying to Jeanies fiancee Eric (Sam Richardson) ""And youre black Ken"" Thats the films one and only reference to the fact that Eric is African-American and its perfectly placed because it becomes a joke on whats going on deep inside the head of an idiot like Mike (and all the other idiots like him). ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" doesnt have a plot so much as it has a messy ambling sprawl. Thats part of whats agreeable about it (were spared the clank of sitcom setups) but also whats a little too-much-of-an-okay-thing about it. The film could have used more of the classic screwball structure that gave ""Wedding Crashers"" its comic punch. Yet it has characters and setups that keep on giving -- like the wonderfully quick-on the-draw Alice Wetterlund as Cousin Terry whos got designs on Tatiana as well as a first-rate tripping-on-Ecstasy interlude and a wildly hilarious sequence in which Jeanie enjoys what might be described as a very nude massage and the whole issue of whether or not the massage ""went too far"" becomes a witty turning of the tables on pre-wedding rituals of male hedonism. Whats funny and winning about ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" is that its a comedy of equal-opportunity raunch where everyone in sight is right at home inside the animal house.

Why did the writer(s)/producer(s) feel that they had to use the ""F"" word in just about every other sentence....the lines were funny enough till that word was brought up. We went to a matinee and there were quiet a few people. However halfway thru the movie several people just got up and walked out. I think the best scene was the ""massage"" one....it was a bit out there but funny. I dont foresee this movie staying at any one theater for more than a few weeks and only show 2-3 shows a day. I checked listings here where we live in AZ and in some theaters they are showing this only 1x a day and thats around 930-10P....wonder why. The last several movies that we saw never had the ""F"" word in it and it was fine. Sooner or later these writers will learn that less is better or just not at all. Its up to them how much money they want to make. Reply LOL says July 6 2016 at 1214 pm Owen Gleiberman has rotten taste.

David Ehrlich Jul 5 2016 1200 pm davidehrlich Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""Mike And Dave Need Wedding Dates"" If its true that every generation gets the ""Wedding Crashers"" it deserves then millennials have finally gotten some definitive proof that theyre doing alright. Starting with a timeless premise -- young people are stupid -- and spinning it into a broad crass and relentlessly amusing mid-summer surprise ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" may not be the first Apatow-era comedy about twentysomethings coming to grips with the fact that they wont live forever (and its certainly not the deepest as it lingers in your memory for about as long as a Snapchat) but it might just be one of the funniest. Very very loosely based on the true story of short-lived viral sensations Mike (Adam Devine) and Dave (Ye Mighty Zac Efron) Stangle this delightful work of idiocy introduces the Brothers Dim through rose-colored shot glasses as the opening credits take us through all the family events that these party animals supposedly elevated into legend. A few scenes later director Jake Szymanski cleverly sets the record straight as Mr. Stangle (Stephen Root) walks us through the truth of how all those incidents really went down. In short Mike and Dave are lovable screw-ups at an age when everyone else has grown tired of their shtick. Theyre nice guys with dumb grins and good hearts; theyre overgrown children but theyre not pigs. So when their younger sister Jeanie (Sugar Lyn Beard) insists that her siblings bring dates to her destination wedding -- a preemptive attempt to stop them from ruining yet another Stangle family gathering -- the edict is coming from a place of love. And when the Stangle brothers trawl the internet for dates by creating a ridiculous Craigslist ad (complete with an image of their heads photoshopped onto the bodies of centaurs) theyre just trying to make their sister happy. And when the ad blows up and lands them on ""The Wendy Williams Show"" (as it did in real life) its that same sense of kindness that convinces the bros gender-swapped doppelgangers Alice (Anna Kendrick) and Tatiana (Aubrey Plaza) that the Stangles are their easily exploitable tickets to a free weekend in Hawaii. They convince Mike and Dave that theyre ""nice girls"" and the fortuitous foursome is off to ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" territory before you have time to sift through the gender politics. READ MORE Zac Efron and Seth Rogen Spoof ""The Walking Dead"" in Parody Trailer for ""Neighbors 3"" That would appear to be intentional -- ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" might share a star (and two inspired screenwriters) with ""Neighbors 2"" but it has zero interest in making any sort of overt statement about the double standards between men and women. So far as this movie is concerned the battle of the sexes has been declared a stale mate with every aimless millennial just looking to game the system however they can. The prolonged charade with which Tatiana convinces Mike that shes a teacher (not a bartender at a sexist sake joint) is a massive waste of time for everyone involved us included. ""Mike and Dave"" is hardly woke as fuck -- thats hip millennial speak for ""enlightened"" for those not in the know -- but its aimed at a generation for whom female characters arent believable as mere objects or plot points. One look at Plazas withering glare and its clear that Tatiana is nobodys fool; nobodys anything. When the film name-checks ""Wedding Crashers"" it feels like a needless reminder that Vince Vaughn is a spokesman for a bygone cultural moment. Director Jake Szymanski is nothing if not a product of the internet age -- this is his first feature and his previous credits include digital shorts like ""Bat Fight with Will Ferrell"" ""Red Bull Energy Douche"" and ""Three Matthew McConaugheys and a Baby."" But his talent extends beyond parodying pop culture as it turns out that he can orchestrate a traditional comic set piece with the best of them. The films crudest (and funniest) sequence is pure Farrelly brothers as Jeanie enjoys a very sensual massage courtesy of ""Silicon Valley"" star Kumail Nanjiani whose recent ""Central Intelligence"" cameo was also the highlight of that movie. A number of other strong gags are laced throughout; Szymanski begins pumping them out rapid-fire when things really get cooking towards the end. So while the story holds together about as well as you might expect in a movie adapted from a Craigslist ad the sum is easy to forgive in light of so many great parts. Efron who is growing into one of our most charming and reliable comic actors preys on the same underlying sensitivity that made both of the ""Neighbors"" films so winsome. Devines manic energy wears thin pretty fast but his character is redeemed by the actors relentless self-deprecation -- characters are constantly telling Mike that hes human garbage compared to his god-like younger brother and every shot across the bow earns a laugh. Plaza doesnt stray too far from her brand -- Tatiana is unsurprisingly droll and cutthroat -- but the actress continues to prove that shes more than just her affectations and her performance is backboned by a heartfelt riot of inner chaos and an uproarious talent for pratfalls (seriously she has a gift). Kendrick has less to do as Plazas lovesick foil but she rises to the occasion of every joke and a late sequence involving ecstasy and a band of horses is as funny as anything shes ever done. Like everyone else in the movie Alice has to grow up in her own way and while ""Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates"" may not be a particularly convincing or memorable portrait of maturation the fact that Kendricks character even has an arc is enough to make you believe that bro comedies are finally coming of age. Grade B ""Mike And Dave Need Wedding Dates"" opens in theaters on Friday.
