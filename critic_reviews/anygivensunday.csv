Posted December 29 1999 -- 1200 AM EST ""Any Given Sunday"" is a vast and pummeling paradox - a kaleidoscopic bone crusher. The movie is edited like a disarming scissor-cut tackle the visuals coming at you from every angle with an ultraviolent slice-and-dice suddenness. For two hours and 40 minutes Stone rubs your nose in the raw animal aggression of pro football filling up the screen with the games potent destructive force. This is hypercompetitive cutthroat filmmaking an attempt by the director to wipe away all previous football movies with the relentlessness of his vision the fluent speed-metal kick of his brutality. ""Any Given Sunday"" is jagged and alive. It has some bracingly authentic scenes set in locker rooms groupie parties and announcers booths and it features a major performance by Jamie Foxx. Yet the films cumulative effect is as exhausting as it is exciting. For Stone the violence of pro football is a form of pure catharsis - the ultimate in cleansing primitivism. Its the timeless spectacle of men pretending to be every bit as homicidal as deep down they really are. Here though its football itself that gets pounded and degraded. Stone reduces the sport to its bloody brute essence (tackling ground war wrecked bodies). Stones patented image layering comes at us with far less precision than it did in ""Natural Born Killers"" or ""Nixon"" but he must have been so jazzed by the prospect of filtering pro football through that style that he didnt worry about the cliche-bogged script. The film presents us with an aging coach Tony DAmato (Al Pacino) who is still trying to lead the Miami Sharks even though hes been rendered a relic by the new era of ruthlessness both on the field and off. Tony spars all too predictably with the teams shrill yuppie-princess co-owner (Cameron Diaz doing the worst acting of her career) but his big battle is with quarterback Willie Beamen (Foxx). Willie isnt just a hotshot - hes a new kind of player. He improvises ignoring the playbook and even the coachs instructions; hes like a digital quarterback ruling a field thats still analog. Before long he becomes a star an endorsement god even a hip-hop idol. Foxx inhabits a bravado thats gripping in its icy power. Willies swagger blazes through all lies including the coachs leaving only the residual ash of racial bitterness. The movie centers on Tonys attempt to break Willie to tame his insurrectionary ways and teach him the old-fashioned glory of football. But what is it exactly that Willie has to learn? He wins games. Thats all that matters; its all that mattered to Tonys most celebrated role model Vince Lombardi. In ""Any Given Sunday"" Oliver Stone traps himself in a contradiction between two brands of sentimental machismo - the celebration of brutality for its own sake and the old-school ""teamwork"" that the movie lionizes as victory long after having demonstrated that its nothing but nostalgia.

Satiric surreal fun; Bad Teacher and star Diaz make no grade Watch a clip from the film ""Cars 2"" courtesy Walt Disney Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern June 24 2011 Five years ago when ""Cars"" proved to be Pixars first less-than-stellar animated feature an animator friend offered his theory about why. Cars he said can have faces but they dont have hands; theres only so much you can have them do. To make up for their lack of hands the cars in ""Cars 2"" do all sorts of cool things with their front tires and the 3-D animation as a whole is spectacular. But the movie has its own deficits--a lack of variety originality subtlety clarity and plain old charm. The law of averages has finally caught up with the most remarkable studio in modern movie history the dream factory that lived up to Buzz Lightyears joyous cry of ""To infinity and beyond."" This frenzied sequel seldom gets beyond mediocrity. ENLARGE Lightning McQueen and Tow Mater in Cars 2. Disney/Pixar Theres certainly no lack of clarity in the calculations behind Pixars swerve. In the five years since ""Cars"" was released the movie has sold something in the neighborhood of 10 billion in merchandise--cute little cars trucks and other vehicles that keep rolling off the toymakers assembly lines in epic numbers. To sustain such financial numbers--and to pave the way for next summers opening of a 12-acre Cars Land at Disneys California Adventure Park--Pixar and Disney the animation studios relatively new owner needed a hard-sell crowd-pleaser with exactly the sort of high-octane action and high-decibel soundtrack that energizes--or blights depending on your point of view--""Cars 2."" This is something new for Pixar a movie in which characterization and deep feelings take a back seat to breakneck pace and something new for Pixar lovers including me who may find themselves wondering if Disneys master merchandisers are starting to call the tune for Pixars master storytellers. The story here concerns a pair of American innocents abroad--Lightning McQueen the bright-red race car brightly voiced by Owen Wilson and Tow Mater the buck-toothed good-hearted tow truck who speaks in the cornpone tones of Larry the Cable Guy. Taking their leave of Radiator Springs the time-warpy desert town that served as the setting for ""Cars"" the two buddies head for Europe where Lightning enters the first of several competitions in the World Grand Prix and Mater is mistaken for a spy. The repetitive race sequences--vroom vroom vrooming at warp speed--are intercut with a James Bond spoof that centers on Finn McMissile a supercar with superweapons voiced by Michael Caine and that starts the action in a preface set on a giant oil platform at sea. (The preface to ""Toy Story 3"" which was absurdly and delightfully over the top turned out to be Andys fantasy. This one elaborate but clumsy is part of the narrative.) From one moment to the next ""Cars 2"" comes up with plenty of visual zingers a Parisian marche aux pieces (as in spare parts); a plunge into the giant clockworks of Londons Big Bentley; a Japanese toilet designed to pamper any chassis; exotic cars galore including such exotic lemons as the Pacer the Gremlin and what the movie calls the Hugo. And as cool as the story tends to be on a scale of emotional temperature it does evoke an affecting friendship between Lightning and Mater one thats tested by driving ambition and a deadly bomb. Still this is a Pixar animated feature were talking about a film from the people who brought genuine enchantment into our lives with tales of toys come alive of beguiling bugs fantastical fishies impassioned robots and self-reflective superheroes. Whats more its a film co-directed (with Brad Lewis) by John Lasseter the man who more than anyone else has embodied the studios spirit from the days when he used a computer to create a pioneering Pixar short about a couple of desk lamps. By now its a commonplace that Mr. Lasseter whose father was a parts-department manager in a Chevy dealership in Southern California was prompted to make the first ""Cars"" by profound car love. That film for all its odd mixture of tedium and frenzy operated within recognizable Pixar parameters. But in this one cars seem unconstrained by the laws of physics and writers seemed unconcerned with developing character as opposed to belaboring it. (Mater gets to be as maddening as that old Hollywood yodeler Andy Devine.) For Pixars sake and for ours lets hope that the fast track of ""Cars 2"" is a temporary detour. Watch a clip from the film ""The Names of Love"" courtesy Music Box Films. ENLARGE Sara Forestier and Jacques Gamblin in The Names of Love. Music Box Films The Names of Love ""Our two families embody France"" says Baya Benmahmoud the delightful heroine of Michel Leclercs sharp-witted sometimes surreal and largely autobiographical French-language comedy which he directed from a script he wrote with Baya Kasmi. So they do in many ways though not necessarily in the amorous way one might infer from the misleading English title. Baya who is played by Sara Forestier has an earnest Algerian father and a screwy French mother. The filmmakers surrogate Arthur Martin (Jacques Gamblin) has a Jewish mother of immigrant parents and a father who served in the Algerian war. The political intricacies on both sides are too complex to detail here while the comedy flows with daunting fluency from the ostensibly mismatched lovers. Baya a sentimental left-winger who is as volatile as she is alluring sleeps with conservatives in order to convert them; she considers her body a weapon with which to destroy the right wing. Arthur a middle-age middle-of-the-roader studies bird flu as a scientist; at one point he cant sleep with Baya because he must perform a necropsy on suspect geese. ""The Names of Love"" isnt a completely misleading title since love along with lovemaking does prevail. Still the original title ""Le Nom des Gens""--literally ""Peoples Names""--comes much closer to conveying the storys essence. Mr. Leclercs movie in French with good English subtitles often plays like romantic comedy but its really a sophisticated burlesque about the significance of surnames (his is comically common hers misleads people into thinking shes Brazilian) plus some quintessentially French obsessions the trap of racial identity; the politics of ethnicity and the fateful power of the past populated as it is for Baya and Arthur by ancestors who suffered for them dreamed for them and loved them. ENLARGE Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher. Columbia Pictures Watch a clip from ""Bad Teacher"" starring Cameron Diaz Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel. Bad Teacher From the evidence on screen no one who made this alleged comedy ever noticed that no one in it was remotely likable. The heroine Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) has been teaching at a middle school to kill time until her impending marriage to a rich guy. Her academic qualifications are never in evidence but she is manifestly a lazy cynical oversexed unprincipled foul-mouthed pot-puffing booze-slugging gold-digging slut who is not only dislikable but unfunny. Then her marriage plans go awry and her flaws multiply. Have talented actors ever struggled so much to so little avail? Ms. Diaz sells her lines like a street vendor peddling fake Timexes. Lucy Punch mugs and pouts as Elizabeths rival Amy Squirrel. Justin Timberlake plays the creepily fey Scott Delacorte a rich substitute teacher who sings a ghastly song called ""Simpatico."" (""Ask me how much I love you. A lottico."") Only Jason Segel finds a few fugitive flashes of likability--yes Im backtracking a bit here--as a gym teacher named Russell Gettis. (Lots more gravitas in that name than in Squirrel.) How did ""Bad Teacher"" which was directed by Jake Kasdan come into being? Maybe someone having seen Jack Black in ""The School of Rock"" decided to do something even raunchier with a female teacher (and failed to notice that both the star and his material were terrifically funny.) Or maybe the production began--as it should have ended--with the clever risque poster that shows among other things Ms. Diaz with her booted feet on a teachers desk. How much do I loathe this film? A lottico is putting it mildico. DVD FOCUS A Bugs Life (1998) The second Pixar feature this animated fable teems with vivid creatures standing on their own countless feet. The ant hero Flik (Dave Foley) wants to throw off the tyranny of the grasshoppers who led by the malevolent Hopper (Kevin Spacey) demand a huge cut of every harvest. Journeying forth to the big city in search of help Flik mistakes the members of a broken-down flea circus for puissant warriors brings them back home and presents them as the colonys saviors. The clowns redeem themselves but only by helping fearful antdom find the courage to get real and hang tough. Amelie (2001) Jean-Pierre Jeunets French-language fable isnt about racial identity or any of the other preoccupations of ""The Names of Love."" As a stylistic tour de force though it has been hugely influential on many filmmakers of varied ethnicities. First the film conjures up a telepathic but touchingly fragile heroine played by Audrey Tautou who rearranges other peoples lives even though shes terrified to live her own. Then the movie puts this elfin do-gooder/do-badder at the center of a fanciful world that looks like everyones idealized notion of Paris no crowds no dirt no traffic no permanent grief. Any Given Sunday (1999) Thinking about Cameron Diaz may not put you in mind of Oliver Stones movie about human worth vs. net worth but its entertaining all the same. Al Pacino is an aging coach who still thinks the game should be fun. Ms. Diaz is Christina Pagniacci a steely young franchise owner and Jamie Foxx is Willie Beamen a headstrong quarterback who brings Christinas team a star quality that she covets. If the field is tilted toward traditional values thats the fun of this fantasy version of the NFL in which morality finally proves a smoother lubricant than corporate moolah.

"Any Given Sunday | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; any-given-sunday ) Any Given Sunday (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli It is well known that superlative film editing can save a mediocre motion picture. Sadly the opposite can also be true. A case in point is Any Given Sunday which despite a potentially engaging story and a number of good performances is at times unwatchable. The reason is simple during post-production director Oliver Stone frequently dipped into his bag of cinematic tricks to pull out quick cuts slo-mo sequences fades to black-and-white and about a dozen other gimmicks. The film is restless to the point of distraction and the audio is so pumped up that about a third of the dialogue is unintelligible. Stone is an egomaniac; its impossible to watch Any Given Sunday and not ponder the directors role in piecing together the film. This is not a good thing since it inevitably takes the viewer out of the reverie needed to enjoy a film and sets him or her up as an arbiter of Stones technique. The filmmaker has engaged in this sort of cinematic masturbation before (most notably in Natural Born Killers) but never to this extent. Used sparingly aspects of this approach can be effective but Stone gorges himself on bizarre shots and visual weirdness. Complete with a relentless driving score that is half heavy metal and half hip-hop the film almost functions as the longest music video ever assembled. It is the embodiment of the MTV style never dwelling on anything for more than a second or two. It jumps around like a marionette on speed. During Any Given Sundays first half a story struggles to emerge from the assualt on our senses. Thankfully by the time the movie approaches the two hour mark (its yet another entry into the Christmas three-hour club - the official running length is 245) Stone has lightened up and we are allowed to relax and concentrate on the plot. In fact despite the cynical world-weary tone that pervades Any Given Sundays first two-thirds the final 60 minutes plays like a fairly traditional football movie. Theres a big playoff/payoff game in which characters learn life lessons on the field en route to a rousing finale. Theres even an old-fashioned moral winning may be important but its not as important as how you play the game. The only thing missing at the end is a group hug. The anti-Knute Rockne sentiment which pervades much of the film is wiped away by the time the end credits roll. The story is relatively straightforward which makes it unfathomable why Stone felt he needed three hours to tell it. (Nearly every long movie released during the final two months of 1999 has suffered from director overindulgence. Hollywood argues that were getting more for our money but there are times when less is better.) Tony DAmato (Al Pacino) is the longtime head coach of the Miami Sharks football team. Hes a cross between Vince Lobardi Tom Landry and General George S. Patton. When his star quarterback Jack Rooney (Dennis Quaid) goes down with a back injury DAmato must rely on the skills of an untried rookie Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx). After a few spectacular wins Beamen lets his newfound celebrity status go to his head angering DAmato and multi-million dollar running back Julian Washington (LL Cool J). But the teams bitchy owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) loves Willie and demands that DAmato play him even when Jack returns -- and the Sharks offensive coordinator Nick Crozier (Aaron Eckhart) shares her opinion. Meanwhile DAmato suffers an attack of conscience when he learns that the team doctor Dr. Harvey Mandrake (James Woods) has been clearing injured players for games when they arent healed. DAmato replaces Mandrake with the younger and more idealistic Dr. Allie Powers (Matthew Modine) who quickly succumbs to the lures of football money and women. Even without considering the films stylistic elements Any Given Sunday claims an odd structure. For two hours Stone appears to be presenting an expose on the ways greed and selfishness have wrecked professional football. We see players who are eager to get on the field because a million dollar bonus is tied to their statistics. Theres an owner who will hold a city for ransom to get a better stadium. And theres a young quarterback who changes the plays in the huddle to make himself look better. DAmato sees all of this and shakes his head commenting that football was ruined the moment TV got involved and demanding that ""this game has got to be about more than winning"" But no one listens to him. However during the films final hour Stone does an about face and Any Given Sunday turns into any given sports movie complete with all the rah-rah speeches and the testosterone-and-adrenaline cocktail offered up by a big-play ending. Admittedly this kind of formula approach to a film about football is more entertaining than the cynical vision adopted by Stone earlier in the proceedings but it also raises questions about what exactly the director is trying to accomplish. The Jerry Maguire ending is at odds with the Wall Street beginning. Any Given Sunday is also about the warrior fraternity of football players and how they cope with the inevitable end of their careers. While the gladiator symbolism is laid on a little too thickly (right down to the inclusion of Ben-Hurs Charlton Heston in a small role) it drives home Stones point about players and their bloodthirsty fans. The football stadium is the modern Coliseum. Through DAmato and Rooney both of whom are nearing the ends of their careers Stone briefly examines the fear that confronts sports lifers as they face the possibility of existence after the game. This is the same subject that was tackled for baseball by this summers For Love of the Game. In the lead Al Pacino does what Al Pacino does best - he turns up the intensity and commands the cameras attention for every scene. Hes not as good as he was in The Insider but that hardly matters. Stone has surrounded his star with a top-flight supporting cast. Perhaps the real revelation is Cameron Diaz who goes toe-to-toe with Pacino matching his every profane utterance with one of her own. Diaz who often plays soft roles (although there have been exceptions such as her part in Very Bad Things) gets a chance to really turn nasty. Her confrontations with Pacino are some of the films highlights. The other scene-stealer is James Woods who has a terrific one-on-one with Pacino. Unfortunately Woods is underused. Other than that scene he is given minimal exposure. Jamie Foxx is effective as the up-and-coming star whose sudden success goes to his head. Dennis Quaid Everybodys All American is low key and content to remain in the background. Additional secondary players include John C. McGinley as a confrontational sports writer Lela Rochon as Beamans girlfriend (a thankless role) and Lauren Holly as Rooneys high maintenance wife. Football Hall-of-Famers Lawrence Taylor and Johnny Unitis have parts and (in another nod to his ego) Stone has cast himself as a TV commentator. I suspect that Any Given Sunday will work better on video than it does in the theaters. In a more intimate medium Stones over-the-top style wont drown out everything else and the storyline will gain the prominence it needs. There is some worthwhile material here especially for gridiron fans but theres too much to wade through to get to it. When he reins in his excesses Stone can be a capable and compelling director. When hes out-of-control however this kind of chaotic hyperactive mess is the result. Any Given Sunday should come equipped with a warning label indicating that its viewer unfriendly.

A rambunctious hyperkinetic testosterone-and-adrenaline-drenched look at that American obsession known as professional football ""Any Given Sunday"" connects for long yardage as smart popular entertainment. Deftly combining brain and brawn in pics use of the modern gladiatorial arena as a staging area for various bigger dynamics operating in contempo society and business life Oliver Stone mixes right-minded takes on innumerable issues with his recently developed helter-skelter style on his way to making his most accessible and purely enjoyable film in years. Long broad and unruly Warner Bros. release nonetheless has the razzle-dazzle star power and pedal-to-the-metal narrative drive to put this one through the uprights commercially in North America although its hard to imagine what auds in football-oblivious countries will make of it. The first major feature about pro football in a generation since the comical ""Semi-Tough"" and the stingingly disenchanted ""North Dallas Forty"" ""Sunday"" is a project that Stone said he conceived as an homage to Robert Aldrich -- a sort of combination of ""The Dirty Dozen"" and the directors prison football yarn ""The Longest Yard."" In the end however Stone who combined elements from three in-development projects to come up with his shooting script has ambitiously gone beyond any of these previous pics to evoke the crisis-crammed lives of at least two dozen characters umbilically connected to the game from owners coaches and players to wives sportscasters and doctors. Stone greatly benefits from the vast canvas this outsize ensemble piece provides as the variety of characters gives him the opportunity to vent his feelings on a host of matters big and small. Director was rather narrowly preoccupied with the criminal side of American culture in two of his last three pictures ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""U-Turn"" and the change of venue has done a world of good in terms of focusing his enormous energies in a more positive direction. Among the central preoccupations here are team ethos vs. selfish individualism the replacement of team and civic loyalty by commercial interests the decline in respect for tradition and the knowledge that no matter how good you are there is always someone younger right behind you anxious to knock you out of the way. Nearly an hour of football action frames the story which begins by plunging the viewer headlong into a bizarre and bitterly fought game in which the Sharks Miamis ""other"" team is hoping to halt a three-game losing streak and keep its hopes alive for the playoffs with three games to go in the season. Using every technique in the modern playbook -- varied film speeds color and black-and-white distorted sound impressionistic visuals lots of handheld camerawork and quick cutting -- ""Any Given Sunday"" serves instant notice that it intends to put the intensity and brutality of the game in your face at turf level as no film ever has before. For 23 minutes the contest plays out in agonizing fashion for the Sharks. First their aging star quarterback Jack ""Cap"" Rooney (Dennis Quaid) goes down from a devastating hit and the same fate awaits the backup. All thats left is the third-stringer the nervous and unprepared Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) who barfs on the field and looks real bad at first. But before the Sharks lose in the final two minutes Willie shows that he may have what it takes to give the team a shot at the playoffs. For the remainder of the season more crises erupt off the field than during games. The Sharks savvy veteran coach Tony DAmato (Al Pacino) who has sacrificed his wife and kids to his job feels that time is beginning to catch up with him that he may not have what it takes to connect with the younger players anymore. Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) has inherited the team with her alcoholic mother (Ann-Margret) and has the sort of ruthless bottom-line mentality entirely at odds with the venerable old school approach of her late father. While Cap struggles to get back in time for the playoffs hot dog Willie reacts to his sudden fame by splitting from his longtime girlfriend (Lela Rochon) taping a raunchy musicvideo and disrespecting his defensive players which in a very amusing party scene he learns is not a smart thing to do. Then theres wide receiver Julian Washington (LL Cool J) a proud veteran with zero tolerance for showoff Willie; Luther ""Shark"" Lavay (Lawrence Taylor) whos so banged up that he risks permanent disability or death from one more hit but insists upon finishing the season to earn a big bonus; defensive coordinator Montezuma Monroe (Jim Brown) who loyally rides the waves of good and bad fortune with Tony; team doctors Harvey Mandrake (James Woods) and Ollie Powers (Matthew Modine) who disagree on such matters as tolerating injuries and doping up players; offensive coordinator Nick Crozier (Aaron Eckhart) who makes no secret of his intention of replacing Tony the sooner the better and opinionated sportscaster Jack Rose (John C. McGinley) who has an outsize ego of his own. With nearly everyone near the boiling point all the time the collisions between characters are abundant. Tony who was close to the late owner and won a championship for him argues incessantly with Christina who would feel much more comfortable with someone at the helm who was not constantly pointing out what her father would have done. And while pondering his future Tony must deal with the rivalry between Cap the great old warrior whos playing on borrowed time and Willie who puts together a winning streak but wont listen to anyone and infuriates Tony by changing plays at the last second. Main figures private lives are sketched in quick clear strokes. Workaholic Tony has time only for one roll in the hay with a high-priced hooker (Elizabeth Berkley) while the elegant imperious Christina has too much to cope with -- a self-pitying mother the thought that her father really wanted a male heir threats from the league commissioner (Charlton Heston) -- to pay heed to the constant array of suitors and aggressive players who would consider her as great a prize as a championship ring. By contrast the flashy brazen players cant possibly handle all the opportunities they get to score off the field. Through all these characters Stone and co-writer John Logan are able to make plenty of sharp observations about the generational racial and attitudinal divides in American life. Just about everyone here is bold arrogant and strong-headed; theres no room for pushovers in this tough professional arena. But there are strong differences all the same within this rarefied group. Pic hits the truth when it expresses the older generations dismay over the young upstarts apparent lack of interest in learning anything from the past identifying the looking-out-for-No.-1 attitude prevalent today and suggesting whats lost in the single-minded obsession with return on investment. Happily however all this remains either implicit in the action or expressed as emotions urgently felt by the characters. Almost cartoonlike at times rather than grimly serious in the style of some earlier Stone outings pic has no time for pontificating as it barrels headlong into the next crisis or the next game the final one of which is a 30-minute playoff humdinger in Dallas thats backdropped by loads of off-field drama. Postseason press conference that accompanies end credits provides an amusingly ironic and right-feeling coda. Working without National Football League sanction and making the teams and league fictional can only have liberated Stone amp; Co. to be as freewheeling as their spirits and inspiration would allow. Uniforms have a bright vaguely futuristic look and a no-holds-barred approach prevails from the down-and-dirty depiction of the game itself to the raucous let-it-all-hang-out look at locker room antics. Although intelligently structured and densely packed with incident and information pic does have a somewhat mangy scattershot nature which is part of its appeal as well as a minor limitation. Using a cinematographer other than Robert Richardson -- commercials and musicvid wiz Salvatore Totino in his feature debut -- for the first time in eons Stone continues in the deliberately raw and rough visual vein of ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""U-Turn"" to potent and lively effect. Film contains an extraordinary number of individual shots that are sometimes edited to deliberately disorienting and choppy effect. Music from myriad sources contributes further to the sensory overload. Performances are almost all shot through with electricity. Pacino one of whose most famous roles was the Stone-written Scarface scores strongly as the beleaguered coach showing clearly that the mans passion is still there along with the accumulated wisdom of the years. Diaz also impresses in the seemingly unlikely role of the football princess who must daily confront a huge legacy. In the dozens of other speaking parts comic actor Foxx is crucially good as the long-frustrated backup who almost spins out of control once he gains the spotlight and rapper LL Cool J also delivers with force. A pleasant surprise is retired New York Giants great Taylor in his screen debut; Stone has dared to give the non-pro an important dramatic scene in a steam bath and Taylor puts it across convincingly. In a sideline role as Caps wife Lauren Holly has only one big scene but its by far the best thing shes done on the bigscreen. Any number of real-life football figures including Y.A. Tittle Dick Butkus Bob Sinclair Warren Moon Johnny Unitas and Barry Switzer pop up along the way as does Stone himself as a broadcaster.

Starring Al Pacino Cameron Diaz Dennis Quaid James Woods Jamie Foxx LL Cool J Matthew Modine Charlton Heston Ann-Margret John C. McGinley. Directed by Oliver Stone. (R. 160 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Raucous violent in-your-face and occasionally advancing like a punch to the belly -- ""Any Given Sunday"" is professional football Oliver Stone-style. Stones dramatic and cogent new sports drama opening today is an eye-stinging ear-popping look at the machinations of the game in which hulking men rush terribly at one anothers bodies for pay glory women and often just a need to exercise serial meanness. Stone mixes skillfully -- using every cinematic trick in the book -- the intense spectacle of the sport with the drama of its spillover into corporate culture. ""Any Given Sunday"" is two hours 40 minutes long. But paced with punchy energy it never feels overly long (definitely not as long as some recent 49er games have seemed). More sensitive viewers may cry foul at this shrill film that clips holds rushes and practically splatters mud and blood onto the first 10 rows of the theater. But whos going to hear their plaints over a heavy metal and rap-inspired soundtrack walls of crowd tumult in the stands and more clanking and grunts per second than any movie in history? For football fans especially those who see the game as a testosterone-fueled gladiatorial ritual of unyielding brutality hog heaven couldnt be more direct raging sexy and authentic (""Jerry Maguire"" is wussy by comparison). But nonsports fans also have reason to rally. ""Any Given Sunday"" features convincing often soaring performances by a savvy cast that must have gotten adrenaline shots administered by Stone himself. Al Pacino one of the best big-screen screamers of all time is inspired as an old-school by-the- book franchise coach Tony DAmato. Hes battling new thinking from the capitalistic front office forced on him by an upstart owner the deceased bosss daughter Christina Pagniacci played by Cameron Diaz in another fascinating role. ""Any Given Sunday"" is packed with so much star power it cant help but score with viewers. The story focuses on a fictional team the once great currently struggling Miami Sharks. Characters are players coaches front-office staff spouses partying hangers-on sportscasters and the coolly ruthless suits of the fictional Associated Football Franchises of America Stones loaded inference about the future of the NFL. Dennis Quaid plays a legendary quarterback for the Sharks. His Jack ""Cap"" Rooney is a classic study of a man going down after years of great-- ness now hobbled by injuries to both his body and his ego. Out with a bum back hes replaced in critical late season play by upstart third- string quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx of TVs ""The Jamie Foxx Show"" -- he also sings two songs on the films punched-up soundtrack). Beamens maverick style rubs coach DAmato the wrong way but the brash player opens eyes in the owners box as the Sharks struggle for a playoff berth. James Woods is perfectly cast as the unscrupulous team physician whose flashy style and greed-driven methods put him at odds with naive assistant medic Dr. Ollie Powers (Matthew Modine). Rap star LL Cool J is the Sharks Julian Washington a sensational running back. His off-field life is a swirl of celebrity bashes and eager female admirers. The film features two real-life football greats -- Jim Brown as a Sharks defensive coach and NFL Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor making his film debut as Luther ""Shark"" Lavay a linebacker with a history of horrendous head injuries. Ann-Margret is heart-rending as Diazs alcoholic mother who tries to drown her miserable life as a shadow in the owners box with booze and drugs. Lauren Holly plays Quaids desperate wife and Lela Rochon is fiery as Beamens ticked-off girlfriend. Elizabeth Berkley plays a hooker Charlton Heston the football commissioner John C. McGinley a colorful sports commentator. Stone cast himself as a sportscaster. Stones take on football is clearly charged with passion for the game and a fascination with the complexities of the business. Pro football is depicted as the nearest thing in flash and ruthlessness to Hollywood and Stone drives the point home. Viewers are likely to get a few chuckles too out of a locker-room sequence where a player lets it all hang out. The film owes its ring of authenticity to a script developed originally by former 49ers tight end Jamie Wil liams and Stone invited a number of great players and coaches to his party. ""Any Given Sunday"" is laced with cameos -- former Dallas Cowboys coach Barry Switzer Y.A. Tittle Dick Butkus Bob Sinclair Warren Moon Johnny Unitas Irving Fryar Terrell Owens Ricky Watters and Williams. As with any filmmaker delving into sport as drama even Stone cant resist the inevitable ""Rocky""- style build-up to a final confrontation. But this film leaves an aftertaste of gloom about the essential inhumanity of the game as well as the cold hearts of people who feed off it.

B Any Given Sunday Genre Drama Action/Adventure; Starring Jamie Foxx Al Pacino Dennis Quaid Ann-Margret Bill Bellamy Elizabeth Berkley Jim Brown Cameron Diaz Charlton Heston LL Cool J Matthew Modine James Woods; Director Oliver Stone; Author John Logan Oliver Stone; Runtime (in minutes) 157; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted January 7 2000 -- 1200 AM EST In Oliver Stones head-smashing football epic Any Given Sunday a player speeds toward the goal line pigskin in hand and two members of the opposing team line up to bushwhack him -- one flying in at shoulder level the other down low. To describe this maneuver as a tackle would be to make it sound far more polite than it is. As the three bodies meet in a series of horrifically exact yet splintered images it looks as if the two defensive players are literally trying to rip the other guy in half and to do so with the cold-crack precision of a death-sport videogame. For most of the movie I got the feeling that Stone was trying to do the same thing to the audience. Any Given Sunday is a vast and pummeling paradox -- a kaleidoscopic bone crusher. The movie is edited like that disarming scissor-cut tackle the visuals coming at you from every angle with an ultraviolent slice-and-dice suddenness. For two hours and 40 minutes Stone rubs your nose in the raw animal aggression of pro football filling up the screen with the games potent destructive force. This is hypercompetitive cutthroat filmmaking an attempt by the director to wipe away all previous football movies with the relentlessness of his vision the fluent speed-metal kick of his brutality. Any Given Sunday is jagged and alive. It has some bracingly authentic scenes set in locker rooms groupie parties and announcers booths and it features a major performance by Jamie Foxx. Yet the films cumulative effect is as exhausting as it is exciting. For Stone the violence of pro football is a form of pure catharsis--the ultimate in cleansing primitivism. Its the timeless spectacle of men pretending to be every bit as homicidal as deep down they really are. Here though its football itself that gets pounded and degraded. Stone reduces the sport to its bloody brute essence (tackling ground war wrecked bodies) running roughshod over its dramatic stop-and-go rhythms and shortchanging the diagrammatic ingeniousness of the plays. Even huge beefsteak linemen and defensive tackles have to think about fakes and details about psyching each other out; a quarterbacks mind is a human radar screen. Youd barely guess that though from Any Given Sunday. Stone at times appears to be trying to demonstrate how the very texture of the sport has been ratcheted up into gladiatorial excess by the forces of a greedy high-tech sports-media culture that broadcasts everything and finds meaning in nothing. He turns football into a barbaric drug and then says in effect ""Admit it--youre hooked."" Except that its Stone who seems hooked on his own nitro flash-cut aesthetic. For all his virtuosity he never quite lets us see the game. Stones patented image layering comes at us with far less precision than it did in Natural Born Killers or Nixon but he must have been so jazzed by the prospect of filtering pro football through that style that he didnt worry about the cliche-bogged script. The film presents us with an aging coach Tony DAmato (Al Pacino) who is still trying to lead the Miami Sharks even though hes been rendered a relic by the new era of ruthlessness both on the field and off. Tony spars all too predictably with the teams shrill yuppie-princess co-owner (Cameron Diaz doing the worst acting of her career) but his big battle is with Willie Beamen (Foxx) the replacement quarterback who gets a break after the legendary Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid) is sidelined. Willie who develops a bizarre ritual of upchucking on the field early in every game isnt just a hotshot--hes a new kind of player. He improvises ignoring the playbook and even the coachs instructions; hes like a digital quarterback ruling a field thats still analog. Before long he becomes a star an endorsement god even a hip-hop idol. Foxx inhabits a bravado thats gripping in its icy power. Willies swagger blazes through all lies including the coachs leaving only the residual ash of racial bitterness. The movie centers on Tonys attempt to break Willie to tame his insurrectionary ways and teach him the old-fashioned glory of football. But what is it exactly that Willie has to learn? He wins games. Thats all that matters; its all that mattered to Tonys most celebrated role model Vince Lombardi. In Any Given Sunday Oliver Stone traps himself in a contradiction between two brands of sentimental machismo--the celebration of brutality for its own sake and the old-school ""teamwork"" that the movie lionizes as victory long after having demonstrated that its nothing but nostalgia.
