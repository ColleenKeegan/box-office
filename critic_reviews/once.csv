Fox Searchlight hide caption toggle caption Fox Searchlight Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard develop an easy unassuming chemistry in Once. Fox Searchlight So this is how you make a low-budget musical these days Forget tap-dancing cellmates and ersatz girl groups. Just start with a bearded appliance repairman (Glen Hansard of the alt-rock band The Frames) who spends his Dublin-streetcorner nights strumming his guitar and singing songs about the woman who done him wrong. Bring on a sweet young thing (Czech singer/songwriter Marketa Irglova) who needs her vacuum repaired and who happens to play piano. Mix in a little backstory about her life as an immigrant round up a few street musicians and a studio technician and before you can say ""Hey lets record a CD"" youve not only got one but a lovely little musical romance to boot. John Carneys direction is so unobtrusive and his story so endearing that you barely notice how smart the film is about character and structure. It seems almost a found object -- sweet and unassumingly authentic.

It richly deserves an even longer and wider run than it has received so far locally. I finally caught up with this truly magical Irish musical as a passive participant in the Ninth Provincetown International Film Festival at which Kathleen Turner received a long overdue Lifetime Achievement Award after being introduced and interviewed in a lively and informative Qamp;A by film scholar Molly Haskell. Mr. Carney has ruefully described his 17-day shoot on hi-definition video as an ""art-house musical"" possibly anticipating some difficulties in attracting audiences to a no-name attraction. It would be more accurate to describe this wondrously affecting achievement as a musicians musical. Cillian Murphy was originally slated to play the lead role of the Dublin street busker who encounters a Czech singer-pianist immigrant eventually played by Marketa Irglova a newcomer to the acting profession. When Mr. Murphy dropped out of the project Mr. Carney decided to use Glen Hansard whod performed with Mr. Carney in the Irish rock group the Frames. It was then Mr. Hansard who recommended the then-19-year-old Czech pianist with whom hed played a few impromptu numbers on a tour in the Czech Republic. The happy end result is that Mr. Hansard and Ms. Irglova make beautiful music together on the screen both literally and figuratively. Dont miss Once. It has to be seen and heard to be believed and enjoyed.

Starring musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova as the unnamed leads the film centres on their unlikely relationship when the Girl (Irglova) an immigrant pianist helps the Guy (Hansard) a street busker to make a demo to take to London. Attracted by their mutual adoration for music a hesitant but empathetic relationship swiftly develops as they come to terms with past loves through the delicately veiled metaphors of lyrics that are subtly woven into the narrative. The performances unfold in music shops buses recording studios and late-night apartments where Carney settles in for long intimate shots of the pair whose songs articulate more about the characters than any monologue could. Too shrewd for idealistic closure the films stiff dose of postmodern angst thwarts numerous romanticised perceptions of love sex and conjugal possibility; besides the Guys too old for the Girl and still infatuated with his ex and she has a child and an estranged husband back in the Czech Republic. Shot on DV Carneys highly charged urban mise-en-scene with its blinking street lamps vacant shops and dishevelled bed-sits provides ample poetic backdrop for the films lengthy tracking shots epitomised in a sequence where the Girl walks to the corner shop in pyjamas and slippers while listening to one of the Guys songs on her personal stereo. With outstanding performances from Hansard and new-comer Irglova Carney has created a sublime visual album of unassuming and self-assured eloquence.

He is a Dublin folk-rocker she a Prague pianist classically trained who borrows the Steinway in a music shop to demonstrate her skills to him. Their courtship is physically chaste musically passionate and deeply satisfying. In this handmade version of the studio-manufactured tunefest Music and Lyrics the Guy (Glen Hansard scruffy lead singer of the Frames) and the Girl (milkmaid-fresh MarkA(c)ta IrglovA!) are random atoms that bump and produce a rare creative energy. Told with the simplicity of a Chaplin film (more than once I was reminded of City Lights) Once has the tentative and unpredictable amble of a chance encounter rather than the absolute and overdetermined structure of a Hollywood film. In this case Girl meets Guy and Girl and Guy make beautiful music - literally - together and apart. More than the music the performances supply the charm of the unassuming film written and directed by John Carney. In a movie season of big bangs and gigantism this acoustic bit of counterprogramming offers quiet characters at human scale. We dont know much about either when at the music store with the Girl at the keyboard the Guy improvises the lyric ""I dont know you. But I want you / All the more for that."" Like lightning in a bottle this little scene in this little movie holds universal yearning and anticipation. It is the lovers prayer; it is the filmgoers appeal. As it crisscrosses Dublin from the modest vacuum-cleaner repair shop where the Guy works alongside his father to the flat the Girl shares with her mother Once shares its sense of discovery of the city and these shaggy citizens. In a lovely sequence the Girl in slippers and bathrobe goes to the convenience store to get batteries and you hear the rhythms of the street become the rhythm of her songs. Only after the film takes leave of the Guy and the Girl do you realize they have communicated almost exclusively through lyrics and song. Its a movie musical as pure as any opera. Once  (out of four stars) Written and directed by John Carney photography by Tim Fleming music by Glen Hansard and MarkA(c)ta IrglovA! distributed by Fox Searchlight. Running time 1 hour 28 mins.

Related Archive | ""Once"" a modern musical in the new Dublin Movie review Showtimes ""Once"" with Glen Hansard Marketa Irglova Hugh Walsh Gerry Hendrick Alastair Foley. Written and directed by John Carney. 88 minutes. Rated R for language. Big splashy musicals like ""Chicago"" and ""Dreamgirls"" bring their own pleasures; likewise tiny song-stories like John Carneys ""Once"" create their own simple joy. The tale of two people in Dublin who come together and touch each others lives with song its a film so gentle and sweet it almost seems ethereal floating along like a singers soft voice. Its tunes stay with you and become companions; its ending image pierces your heart in the kindest of ways. We never learn the characters names but we come to know them quickly. He (Glen Hansard) is a weary-eyed street musician playing for change on a busy shopping street. During the day he performs familiar tunes; at night when the shops have closed he plays his own raw primal songs of love and loss that reveal his own broken heart. One day like magic a pretty young woman appears before him. She (Marketa Irglova) is a Czech immigrant and single mother eking out a living by selling newspapers and cleaning houses. Her eyes shine like stars and she sings like an angel. Though they dont fall in love exactly theyre soon sharing dreams -- which leads in the way of fairy tales to the two of them in a music studio recording his songs seizing the moment. What happens between them is something delicately balanced between friendship and romance a deep connection after which we know that both of their lives will be forever changed. And much of this is told in soul-searching songs written by Hansard (of the Irish band the Frames) and Irglova. Most unfold in performance scenarios in the studio at a piano in a music store on the street with Hansards guitar. But theres one lovely nighttime scene that summons up all that we love about musicals Irglova walks the sidewalks of her neighborhood singing fervently along with a song thats playing in her ears on a portable CD player. Its like ""On the Street Where You Live"" from ""My Fair Lady"" or any of a number of classic musical scenes translated anew. Musicals ask us to take a happy leap of faith to believe in a world in which people express their feelings by bursting into song. With ""Once"" Carney has created that world within our own and it weaves an irresistible spell.

"For Once A Musical Strikes the Right Chords washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Correction to This Article This Style review of ""Once"" incorrectly said that the movie marked actor Glen Hansards feature debut. He made his debut in 1991 in ""The Commitments."" Movies For Once A Musical Strikes the Right Chords Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 25 2007 ""Once"" may be cinemas first bona fide alt-Celtic indie busker musical. At a time when the musical genre has been colonized by sub-par schlock like ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Chicago"" director John Carneys resuscitation of the form is all the more welcome. Glen Hansard of the Irish band the Frames makes an improbably electrifying screen debut as a street singer in Dublin who accepts farthings for covering other peoples songs by day saving his own angsty but unabashedly pretty ballads for the more discerning nighttime passersby. One of his most loyal fans is a young Czech woman played by Marketa Irglova. She and the singer embark on a shy flirtatious friendship. She reveals that she plays a little piano herself and soon theyve entered into a surprisingly fruitful artistic collaboration and -- in a nod to the musicals most enduring convention -- a tentative romance. The best thing of the many very good things about ""Once"" is the clever way Carney integrates the musical numbers into the narrative. Rather than giving Hansard a rainy street an umbrella and an orchestra he lets the songs occur organically as spontaneous moments of vagrant beauty. So Hansard and Irglova pop into a music store at lunch hour and perform a lovely impromptu duet at one of the pianos; Hansard delivers a funny ditty riding her home on a bus; with friends at a winy dinner they share a postprandial tune. Unlike most musicals that depend on a whopping suspension of disbelief ""Once"" seems to be saying ""Hey it could happen."" The wittiest example of Carneys ingenuity is when Irglovas character is trying to come up with lyrics to one of Hansards melodies. While the music plays on her earphones the camera follows her out of her house while she runs an errand and returns; the tracking shot -- only interrupted once -- finally pulls back to reveal that shes wearing a pair of absurdly fuzzy bedroom slippers. In another scene a bank manager theyve approached for a loan to cut a demo record admits -- what else? -- that hes a singer-songwriter too ""Once"" offers a thoroughly welcome tuneful alternative to the blockbusters hogging screens but it helps -- a lot -- if youre a big Frames fan. Hansard is undoubtedly a charismatic compelling screen presence and he has a ferocious way with a songs dynamics. In an early sequence the camera slowly zooms in on his face as his voice grows in intensity from a lyrical Cat Stevens-like purr to a howl. The effect is electrifying. (One clue to the aggression that lurks beneath that emo exterior is the extra sound hole Hansard has worn into his acoustic guitar.) Still the songs in ""Once"" begin to sound too much alike and by the time that demo is being cut they literally begin to repeat. The audiences musical predispositions aside ""Once"" is also a must-see for anyone longing to spend time in Dublin. As much a love song to that great city as anything else the film plunges viewers into its streets and rapidly globalizing culture with intimacy and affection. When ""Once"" takes its final unexpected turns you might be surprised by how completely youve been taken in by what has seemed to be an easygoing low-conflict story. The final shot packs a startling emotional punch and like the rest of the movie unfolds with deceptive lyricism and grace. Once (85 minutes at Landmarks E Street Cinema and Bethesda Row) is rated R for (distinctly Irish) profanity.

"Once A bijou of a film | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesOnce A bijou of a filmWhile the booming cannons of the latest Pirates of the Caribbean instalment clamour for our attention this weekend it may be easy to overlook the brilliance of small and lovely Once quietly playing in the corner.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. May 25 2007 Starring Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard. Directed by John Carney. 85 minutes. At the Cumberland. 14A  While the booming cannons of the latest Pirates of the Caribbean instalment clamour for our attention this weekend it may be easy to overlook the brilliance of small and lovely Once quietly playing in the corner.Article Continued BelowWhich would be a shame. This indie musical is a bijou of a film that joins unaffected performances and a compelling soundtrack in a low-budget documentary-style film that lets us watch two people fall in love to the mesmerizing soundtrack of the songs they create.The winner of the audience award at this years Sundance Film Festival on its surface Once is a simple story of a busker and a flower seller who meet in the streets of Dublin and spend a week writing and making music.They dont even have names. Girl (Czech singer/musician Marketa Irglova in her first film role) meets Guy (Glen Hansard the ringleted redhead guitar player from The Commitments and singer/guitarist for the Irish band the Frames) as he plays for loose change in a Dublin street.Shes drawn to his music. Hes drawn to her although hes unsettled by her directness at first.But she has a small child and a husband back in the Czech Republic and the busker who confesses painful loneliness since his girlfriend packed off for London quickly realizes this is one Guy who wont get the Girl.So they make music. Haunting and powerful songs. They play and sing in a music store where she often rehearses unable to afford her own piano. She sits at the keyboard and he joins her on his old guitar with a fist-sized hole smashed in the front. They sing on the street in the back of a bus the music fills the background as they take a motorcycle trip to the seaside. And best of all the songs are played in their entirety - no frustrating 8-bar snippets or medleys.As they begin to fall for each other the intensity of their music grows almost as a way to distract them from their feelings. The songs lyrics match their stories the films shaky camera work making the scenes scan with realism.Irglova and Hansard had already recorded together before Irish director John Carney (and former Frames bassist) put them on the screen in Once.Their ease with each other shows. Irglova is utterly charming as the guileless young woman who sees no reason to ever accept ""no"" as an answer while Hansards hurt-spaniel eyes track her with wonder and admiration. The music they make especially the Frames ballad ""Falling Slowly"" which builds from a whisper to heart-pounding intensity is as Oscar-worthy as any tune coming out of theatre speakers in years.Theres no pretense and nothing is predictable (including an amusing scene where the two go for a bank loan to fund a weekend in the recording studio and find a wannabe rock star loans manager).They finally make their demo disc with the help of other buskers and especially Girl a woman who refuses to accept any limitations in life.When Once slowly arrives at its inconclusive conclusion youll be grateful that Hollywood didnt get its mitts on this one where the bittersweet gentle finish would have been supplanted by a gargantuan concert scene with crane shots and 60-piece orchestra as the couple perform in triumph.Theres no need. Once is enough.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Directed by John Carney. (R. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Once"" proves once and for all that imagination trumps big bucks. This engaging Irish import packed with so many songs it practically qualifies as a musical was made for less than 200000. When a name actor rumored to be ""Red Eyes"" Cillian Murphy dropped out he was replaced with musician Glen Hansard who conveniently was already drafting the score. His co-star Czech singer Marketa Irglova also has next to no acting experience. (Warning Cliche coming so apt I cant stop myself.) Nevertheless they make beautiful music together. Writer-director John Carney appropriates a familiar plot in which boy meets girl -- his characters are generically called Guy and Girl -- and an attraction is immediate but their time to get to know each other is limited. Its basically ""The Clock"" transported from the streets of New York circa 1940s to the precarious subculture of buskers in contemporary Dublin. Hansard appears as a violinist playing for small change on Grafton the citys famous shopping street. Irglovas Girl a Czech immigrant peddles roses on the same block. Lacking money for permits to legitimately shoot in the popular area Carney used a long lens which gives ""Once"" the look of a home movie. The couples initial conversation has a similar offbeat naturalism. He tells her he works at a Hoover repair shop; she says she has a broken vacuum cleaner. As it turns out they have a great deal more in common. Both have had their hearts shattered His former girlfriend deserted him to move to London; the father of her toddler has gone AWOL. Music is their other bond. Girl sneaks over to a music store whose sympathetic owner allows her to practice on floor model pianos. Her background is classical; his anything but. Listening to her play an especially melodic piece he asks in awe if she wrote it. No she replies Mendelssohn did. Soon the fast friends enlist other buskers to record a demo album. The enterprise -- a weekendlong marathon in which no one gets any sleep -- has a ""lets put on a show"" feel to it. The infectious music is sure to get your feet tapping. The surprise of what this makeshift group comes up with is reflected in the face of a sound engineer who goes from a cynical smirk to a delighted smile. Theres a lovely scene after the demo is finally completed of everybody playing Frisbee on a beach at sunrise. Hansard who performs with the celebrated Irish band the Frames is a natural onscreen. He never seems to be acting adding to the feeling of watching a home movie. Irglova has an open trusting face and her authentic accent makes for some endearing line readings. When the violinist invites her over to his place she replies in charmingly broken English ""For what -- just hanky panky?"" Like Guy and Girls budding relationship ""Once"" speeds by. Dont go expecting some musical extravaganza. This is a very little film with a very large heart. -- Ruthe Stein Zoo Documentary. Starring Paul Eenhoorn Michael Minard and Janine Rose Schweickert. Directed by Robinson Devor. (Not rated. 76 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Oh what Geraldo Rivera would have given to be a documentary filmmaker when this item made headlines in July 2005 A man in Washington state dies of internal injuries after having intercourse with a horse; subsequent investigations show he belonged to a bestiality club operating from the backwaters of the Pacific Northwest. Does drawing a moral conclusion -- after say an hour of garish ex-position -- get any easier? Probably not which makes director Robinson Devors ""Zoo"" all the more compelling. Using a haunting subdued aesthetic thats more disorienting than it is revealing ""Zoo"" draws viewers out of their comfort zone with unnerving questions about love abuse and sexual fantasy. ""Zoo"" chronicles the notorious story of Mr. Hands a Seattle man who died after having sex with a stallion on a ranch outside Enumclaw Wash. The ranch it turned out was the unofficial clubhouse for a group of men calling themselves ""zoos"" (short for zoophiles) whose erotic fantasies ran toward the bestial -- specifically toward male horses several of which lived on the ranch. Mr. Hands death prompted Washington state to pass a law prohibiting sexual congress between man and beast and morning shock jocks had a field day. Through re-enactments with actors (there are no images of bestiality but a few flashes from confiscated videos can be seen) and interviews with the zoos -- only one of whom agreed to appear on camera -- Devor and co-writer Charles Mudede delve into the heart of their strange desire and by extension the larger human tendency to project fantasies on animals. The zoophiles view animals as willing sexual partners and imagine they share an erotic connection; on the other end of the spectrum a woman who confiscates their horses sees animals as children to the point of projecting an infantile innocence onto an adult stallion and gelding the animal to protect him from future abuse. Sexual exploitation versus castration Which constitutes cruelty? Do animals suffer from our relentless tendency to anthropomorphosize them? Devor and Mudede raise the questions but leave us to ponder the answers. Punch lines and outrage come easy but beware If you walk into this film with a secure moral judgment prepare to have it shaken by the time you leave. -- Advisory Contains descriptions and glimpses of man-horse sex. -- Neva Chonin Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

Comments Once Recommended 86 minutes In the opening scene of John Carneys engaging 2006 indie a Dublin busker (Glen Hansard of the Frames) hands his guitar to a passerby and gives chase to the wastrel whos snatched his guitar case and change but when he finally collars the culprit he lets him keep the money. That sort of humanity infuses the movie a low-budget and leisurely plotted DV project in which the singer a poor vacuum-cleaner repairman falls in love with a young Czech immigrant (Marketa Irglova) who plays the piano and helps him put together a band for a demo session. The songs dont advance the narrative lyrically so much as follow the two characters uncertain relationship through the slow realization of their themes; in particular a scene in which they first jam together in the back room of a music store is a gem.

"For Once a rock musical with an irresistible charm - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW For Once a rock musical with an irresistible charm By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  May 25 2007 ""Once"" is a wee slip of a movie 85 minutes long and notably light on plot. Guy meets girl guy writes a few songs with girl guy and girl try to figure out what to do about their mutual attraction. We never learn their names the movies that basic.Yet there are more emotions repressed and then sung out in this transcendent new Irish film than in a year of blockbusters and in its brief running time writer-director John Carney does something both profound and unexpected He reinvents the movie musical as a genre of swooning rock n roll realism.Say again? OK ""Once"" is the first rock musical that actually makes sense. People dont burst into song in this movie because the orchestras swelling out of nowhere. The guy and the girl are working musicians -- or theyd like to be if they could make a living at it -- and theyre played by working musicians Glen Hansard of the Dublin-based group The Frames and the Czech singer-songwriter Marketa Irglova .The performances unfold in well-lit music shops at lunch hour in recording studios on double-decker buses in apartments late at night. Most movies cut away after a few strums but Carney settles in for the long take and you suddenly realize this is the musical number. This is how these inarticulate people speak.If you know your movie history maybe you recall that musicals started this way as Depression-era backstagers with Ruby Keeler kicking into a Busby Berkeley dance routine because it was part of the show she and Dick Powell were rehearsing. ""Once"" actually resurrects that hoariest of old genre cliches the scene where the couple take a break from performing sit at a battered piano and share a tune. Its the only form of courtship the two know and it underscores that lifes already a musical if youre a musician.The Depression analogy is apt too because Carney sets the film in a rough but openhearted Dublin the sort of city where every junkie knows your name and where even the loan officers a frustrated musician. The hero works at his fathers vacuum cleaner repair shop and busks in the subway in the evenings; we first see him singing Van Morrisons ""And the Healing Has Begun "" to disinterested commuters.It has begun because the girl is listening and wants to compare notes in a literal sense. She brings a broken vacuum cleaner to their next meeting -- it trails after her like a sick puppy -- and he mistakes this for romantic interest which its not. Bits of their past leak out the ex-girlfriend hes working out of his system the husband she left in the Czech Republic and good riddance. Eventually though he plays her a song he has written and kept to himself -- it has a Damien Rice feel building from a folky whisper to a glorious scream -- and when she tentatively joins in on harmony its like a first kiss. The films absurd R-rating is for language only; the vocal duets are the closest ""Once"" comes to sex. Although when the man sings ""Take this sinking boat/and point it home/weve still got time"" were already past the carnal and into intimacy.So the climax of the movies not a love scene but a recording-studio sequence the guy and the girl and their hastily assembled band try to cobble the pieces of what theyre feeling into something that might convince a stranger hearing it on the radio. ""Once"" observes the mystery of the creative act -- the false starts the gathering groove -- and finds within it a larger community.After working through the night the band and the producer (Geoff Minogue ) pile exhausted and happy into someones automobile for the ""car test"" -- driving around while listening to the finished demo through tinny speakers. Suddenly the movie has become a different sort of love story a group grope toward the sublime.Carney shoots ""Once"" raw aiming for the aimlessness of captured life. The Irish accents are thick the lighting 40-watt the leads dour and unpretty. If you need glamour this is not your movie. The guy and the girl dont have much use for glamour anyway. Theyre doing the best they can with what they have aware that grace either lands when you least expect it -- in the bridge of a song say -- or slips through your fingers. Theyre listening to the musical we each carry inside us and that no one ever hears. ""Once"" hears it though and it rocks the soul.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

(Correction Because of reporting error a review of the movie ""Once"" in Fridays Weekend section described a character as busking in the Dublin subway. The city does not have a subway system.)

Friday May 18 2007 400 AM FOOLS ERRAND Fay Grim Two and a half stars A Queens housewife goes to Europe to find her mysterious long-lost husband. At the IFC (158). R Language sexuality. After several shaky years iconoclastic filmmaker Hal Hartley inches closer to solid ground with ""Fay Grim"" his ambitious sequel to 1998s ""Henry Fool."" Parker Poseys Fay married enigmatic madman Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan) in the original and now hes gone and shes raising their son. When a CIA agent (an amusing Jeff Goldblum) implies that Henry has been involved in international terrorism Fay heads for Paris determined to find some answers. With its off-kilter pitch and heightened self-awareness Hartleys work has always been an acquired taste. While ""Fay Grim"" is too uneven to win him many converts it is laced with enough intelligence and wit to remind longtime fans why they were drawn to his unique vision in the first place. Elizabeth Weitzman FRENCH RESISTANCE Private Property Two and a half stars Tensions build between a Frenchwoman and her grown sons. At Lincoln Plaza and Cinema Village (135). NR Sexuality violence. In French with subtitles. No one digs into psychosexual family dynamics with more dedication than French actress Isabelle Huppert. Though the results arent always pretty - as with this downbeat drama - they are tough to forget. Huppert plays Pascale mother to spoiled twins (Yannick and Jeremie Renier) who loaf around the house and expect to be waited on despite the fact that theyre well past college age. When Pascale hints at a desire to fulfill her own dreams their resentful reaction builds to dangerous levels. The performances are impeccable but while director Joachim Lafosse carefully creates an atmosphere of suffocating dread he could have let a little more air into this simmering hothouse. E.W.

At the Angelika and AMC Empire (130). R Language drugs sexuality violence. Balancing the frustration of office politics against the threat of decapitation this cheerfully gruesome thriller is bound to give you a renewed appreciation for your own job. Aside from their uptight boss no one at British weapons manufacturer Palisades Defense wants to attend a team-building weekend in the woods. They are therefore especially unhappy when they end up abandoned far from their luxury lodge. And they dont even know about the killers  bear traps and land mines. Youll need a strong stomach but director Christopher Smith mixes lots of laughs into the gore. Despite its predictable finish ""Severance"" is bloody good fun. E.W. TWO-PART HARMONY Once Three stars Romantic drama about two street musicians who spend a week together. At the Landmark Sunshine (125). R Language. The winner of this years Sundance Audience Award John Carneys indie musical is a bit like the best first date youve ever had - and still occasionally dream of. Thats not to say this Irish charmer is a fairy tale. In fact its greatest asset is a bittersweet realism that underscores even the most tender moments. It begins on a Dublin corner where a disillusioned musician (Glen Hansard) plays for passersby. A break in the clouds arrives when he collaborates with and falls for a young busker (Marketa Irglova) who still has her optimism intact. ""Once"" isnt especially complex but the chemistry between its appealing leads (who contribute to the lovely score) feels deeply true. Youd have to look awfully hard to find such sincerity in a Hollywood romance. E.W. Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

A handsome young street musician in Dublin raises his voice in song then raises it higher with heart-stopping fervor. When a mysteriously endearing young woman stops to interrogate the busker about his music -- she turns out to be a musician too -- the movie reveals itself as something magical. When they sing their first duet its a song of such transporting passion that you wonder where the drama can possibly go since theyre obviously made for each other and should instantly leave the screen to live the rest of their lives in private bliss. The lovers are played by Glen Hansard the lead singer of the Irish rock group The Frames and Marketa Irglova a musician from the Czech Republic. (Amazingly given her gifts as a singer pianist and actress Ms. Irglova was only 17 years old when the movie was shot.) Both performances give new meaning to the timeworn phrase ""pitch-perfect"" while both characters do nicely without names; theyre listed in the credits only as the Guy and the Girl. Coy appellations of this sort often serve as warning labels for faux-simple fables that are fatuous or downright cloying but thats hardly the case here. ""Once"" proves to be as smart and funny as it is sweet; it swirls with ambiguity and conflict beneath a simple surface. In all of 88 minutes Mr. Carneys singular fable follows its guy and girl through a week of musical and emotional growth that could suffice for a lifetime. ENLARGE Music is intrinsic to the filmmakers plan. The love story can be seen -- and felt and heard -- as a succession of chord changes and the exquisite resolution amounts to a mutual musical offering. At a time when movie musicals have come to be synonymous with emotional and visual extravagance -- the super-mega-over-the-topness of ""Chicago"" or ""Dreamgirls"" -- Mr. Carney has dared to take everything down to its essence. Whats left is two intensely likable people trying urgently through very few words and a bakers dozen of eloquent songs to come to terms with love theyve lost and collaborate on the future. As Guys go this one seems like the answer to a Girls prayer. He sings like an angel -- a loud angel whos no stranger to anger. He summons sumptuous sounds from his battered guitar and writes brilliant songs when he isnt fixing Hoover vacuums in his fathers Dickensian shop. As Girls go this one is irresistible from the first moment she opens her mouth When was the last time you couldnt wait to find out what a movie character was all about? Shes got spunk to spare speaks with a slightly extra-terrestrial accent sings with no accent at all writes her own powerful songs and miracle of miracles has a Hoover that needs repair. (In one of the many memorable sequences in the film which was shot by Tim Fleming she trails her ailing vacuum cleaner like a blue dog on a hose as she and her Guy stroll through Dublins streets.) In 1991 the year that Glen Hansard started The Frames he also played Outspan the baby-faced Dublin guitar player in ""The Commitments"" a feature that has gained a global following. (Its one of my favorite films ever.) What makes ""The Commitments"" so widely loved is among other pleasures its use of a working-class rock bands rise and fall as an armature for individual drama. ""Once"" may earn the same special status by doing something similar albeit on a more intimate scale -- using pop-rock songs to shape its characters ecstatic feelings. And very much like ""The Commitments"" this remarkable new Irish film grounds its Guy and Girl in the rock-solid specifics of musicianship. When she plays Mendelssohn on a piano in a music store he listens with enchanted intensity. When they finally get to singing lyrics she has written to his melody the sense of their intimacy transcends physicality. (Its worth noting that the story neither needs nor bothers with conventional sexual interludes.) My own feeling is that I should say something negative here; how else will anyone trust all this praise? In fact the film presents inevitable language problems -- not bad language of which there is more than a soupcon but the authentic and sometimes impenetrable language of a guy from Ireland and a girl from Moravia who dont speak in mid-Atlantic tones. Another problem could be more substantial or may have been confined to the projection at my screening where the audio quality of some of the music tracks left a lot to be desired. Enough of that though. The title of one of those tracks is ""You Must Have Fallen From the Sky."" Thats the way I came to feel about ""Once."" Shrek the Third ENLARGE Being Green The computer-animated ogre returns for another outing in Shrek the Third. We live in a world of wonders. According to the production notes for ""Shrek the Third"" the animation artists used HP DLI45 ProLiant servers and HP xw9300 workstations powered by AMD Operton processors. So whats the result? A parallel world of wonders zestfully conceived and radiantly rendered in which the great-hearted ogre tries his likeable best to avoid the parallel threats of kingship and parenthood. This latest iteration of DreamWorkss money machine has its ups and downs its longueurs along with its felicities plus an abiding preoccupation with poop. In the proper context though -- a profusion of feature animation thats second-rate or worse -- ""Shreks"" return is a signal event and the signal of course shines green. The issue of reigning over the kingdom of Far Far Away is raised by the death of Fionas froggy father King Harold (who voiced by John Cleese gives a hilariously rambling death-bed speech.) Shrek is the logical successor to the throne but terrified by the responsibility he sails off to find an acceptable substitute in Fionas cousin Artie (Justin Timberlake) a student at Medieval High where Hogwarts meets the San Fernando Valley. Eddie Murphys Donkey and Antonio Banderass Puss are back too although Donkeys role has lost its bite without losing its whinny; for a while it sounded as if someone was impersonating Mr. Murphy. Among the new arrivals are Eric Idles Merlin who puts on an impressive magic show and despite Shreks worst fears and best efforts at denial a houseful of cute little baby ogres who draw -- not only thanks to the wonders of computers -- from vast reservoirs of spit-up.    DVD TIP ""Brassed Off"" (1996) is a fantasy with music set in working-class Yorkshire during the Thatcher era when the government was closing coal pits throughout Britain. In one grimy town a colliery brass band struggles on in the quixotic belief that its survival will save the local mine and the towns livelihood. The cast includes Ewan McGregor Pete Postlethwaite and Tara Fitzgerald as the glorious Gloria who plays flugelhorn.

May 18 2007 Save for later Saved New in theaters Once (R)Director John Carney. With Glen Hansard Marketa Irglova Hugh Walsh Gerry Hendrick Alastair Foley. (98 min.) Director John Carneys Sundance hit is a lackadaisically crafted romance about a Dublin street musician (Glen Hansard) who pairs up with a Czech immigrant pianist (Marketa Irglova). It features lots of songs and recording sessions and yet still manages to seem slightly otherworldly as if the two moonstruck musicians were acting out their own fantasies of success and heartbreak. The film drags a bit and Irglovas inexperience as an actor sometimes leaves her costars in the lurch. But its a sweet little film just the same. Grade B+- Peter Rainer Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Even Money (R) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Director Mark Rydell. With Danny DeVito Kim Basinger Nick Cannon Forest Whitaker Carla Gugino. (113 min.) Hot on the heels of ""Lucky You"" we have another movie about gambling addiction and its even less successful. Director Mark Rydell who has seen better days with films like ""The Rose"" wants to make an existential thriller about lost souls panting for another turn of the wheel. But everyone in the movie including Kim Basinger Danny DeVito Kelsey Grammar Tim Roth and Forest Whitaker looks as if they just emerged from watching a film noir marathon on TCM. As the gambler who needs his basketball phenom brother to shave points Whitaker has some expressive scenes and Roth knows how to make malice gleam. But almost nothing else in this movie does. Grade C-- P.R.Still in theaters Georgia Rule (R)Director Garry Marshall. With Jane Fonda Lindsay Lohan Felicity Huffman Dermot Mulroney Garrett Hedlund. (109 min.) Three generations of rebellious women fall apart and come together in ""Georgia Rule."" Since the women are played by Jane Fonda Felicity Huffman and Lindsay Lohan I was looking forward to the ride but soon found myself staring bug-eyed at the screen Theres enough family dysfunction here to fill out a dozen soppy soap operas. ""Georgia Rule"" is the kind of small-town movie that looks as if it was made by people who never set foot outside Hollywood. (Needless to say the movie was shot in and around Los Angeles.)

"Once | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; once ) Once (Ireland 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli The traditional movie musical may not be dead but its on life support a victim of the changing taste of movie-goers. Once is an effort to provide a musical that works for a modern audience by grounding the situation in reality and cutting out the corniness and implausibility of characters suddenly and inexplicably bursting into song. What was magical in the 40s and 50s may be seen as silly by todays standards. However if a film can find a way to make the songs part of the storyline a huge impediment is avoided. Thats what writer/director John Carney has achieved in Once. The film has a minimal plot not even going far enough to name its characters. Its about the relationship between a street musician (Glen Hansard) and a kindred spirit - a younger girl (Marketa Irglova) who hears his songs and compels him to get into a studio and record them. The attraction between them is palpable but their relationship remains platonic. He is pining over a girlfriend who left him to relocate to London (where he plans to go in several days time) and she left behind a husband in the Czech Republic when she came to Dublin in search of a better life for her and her infant daughter. As close as they become during their time together nowhere do they connect more fully and meaningfully than through the music they both adore. The songs - and there are about a dozen of them - are seamlessly integrated into the fabric of the understated romance. Theres no sudden jarring transition in which a musical number breaks the films delicate spell. There are several wonderful moments such as when the girl and guy first connect while singing something called ""Falling Slowly"" in a piano shop (hes strumming the guitar and shes accompanying him on a keyboard) or when a sound board operator in a studio takes notice of what hes hearing. The musics lyrics refer to events in the past of both characters but as they share the experience of singing to one another they take on a more immediate power. The protagonists never admit their feelings to one another in words but the truth is apparent in their music. (Technically this isnt true. There is a moment when the man asks her whether she loves her husband. She responds ""No. I love you."" However her response is in unsubtitled Czech so the man does not understand her - nor do audience members who dont know the language.) For his leading man director Carney looked up an old friend. The director who began his public career as the bass player for the group the Frames and went on to direct their early videos approached Frames lead singer Glen Hansard about the role. Despite having only one acting part on his resume from the 1991 film The Commitments Hansard agreed. With him he brought 17-year old Marketa Irglova (in her first film appearance) a friend with whom he had recently recorded an album. On screen the two display unforced chemistry and their emoting during the musical scenes is superb. There is an uneven quality to their performances however; when theyre not singing there are moments of awkwardness. Traditional musicals rely on picture perfect cinematography but Carney is no Busby Berkley. Once is filmed documentary style with shaking hand-held shots and poorly framed close-ups. The approach changes mid-way through the film and things appear polished by the time the movie closes with an impressive tracking shot but those who find unsteady shots to be motion sickness-inducing may have a few worrisome moments near the outset. All of the music in Once was composed and performed by the leads. This is a rarity in movie musicals where the lead actors are often overdubbed during songs because their voices dont pass muster. Here Carney trusts to the vocal and songwriting talents of his leading couple. Their songs are a mixture of folk and rock and are unaccompanied by dance moves. They are shown playing their instruments often with great passion but never do they break character and start doing something a person in their position would not do in real life. Once won the 2007 audience award at the Sundance Film Festival. It was subsequently purchased for U.S. distribution by Fox Searchlight which has made the dubious decision to release it in late May opposite the likes of Shrek the Third and Pirates of the Caribbean 3. Certainly no one expects Once to topple these blockbusters from their perches but it deserves to be seen and offers more real human emotion than most of the years would be box office busters. This isnt a perfect motion picture but in the midst of summers vapid pursuit of spectacle a movie that provides real heart and emotion is a rare find.

Two actual Dublin singer-songwriters of as-yet minor renown play fictive ones in ""Once"" which took the World Cinema Audience Award at Sundance. Winningly unpretentious tale uses a wispy romantic narrative as a vehicle for attractive original tunes. Pics charm seems so offhand one might not notice the skill with which helmer John Carney pulls it off or how it plays like a full-blown musical without anyone bursting into song. Picked up for world rights minus Ireland by Summit Entertainment ""Once"" will require outreach to folk/alt-rock fans to realize offshore sleeper potential. A mid-30s man IDd only as ""Guy"" (Glen Hansard) still works and lives above his fathers vacuum repair shop busking downtown in off-hours hoping for a music-biz break. One day hes approached by a pretty Czech immigrant ""Girl"" (Marketa Irglova) who supports her mother and child -- the father remains back home -- selling roses to shoppers. She too is a musician-songwriter. When Guy gets past her initial pushiness he finds both an artistic collaborator and a frustrating love object. Soon theyre drafting other players for a marathon recording sesh. Natural thesping and appealing music make the whole enterprise a low-key charmer.
