When Meg (Gomez) is mistaken for an heiress the girls go with the flow and find themselves among the well-to-do of glitzy Monte Carlo. But how long before theyre rumbled? Ridiculously contrived superficial throughout and too sugary Monte Carlo is still too innocent and convivial to cast too many aspersions on.

Where the film disappoints is in trying to be both. Apple-cheeked Bieber-squeeze Selena Gomez stars as Grace - and with a name like that you know shes Monaco-bound - a small-town waitress whos been saving up to go to Paris after her high school graduation. With best pal Emma (Katie Cassidy) and wet-blanket stepsister Meg (Leighton Meester) in tow the three of them go on one of those package tours where the guide says things like ""On your left...was Notre Dame"" on the way to a 20-minute visit to the Louvre. Our heroines get separated from their group and Grace gets mistaken for international celebutante and troublemaker Cordelia Winthrop Scott (also Gomez playing rich-bitch with relish) and when Cordelia flakes on a trip to Monte Carlo for a charity auction Emma convinces Grace to pretend to be her. The set-up and the climax of these farcical shenanigans have a goosey lift and director Thomas Bezucha (who made the lovely gay romance ""Big Eden"" and the decidedly less adorable ""The Family Stone"") slams doors and hides valuable necklaces with aplomb. But ""Monte Carlo"" has bigger chick-lit (its based on Jules Bass novel ""Headhunters"") fish to fry so we have to see pouty Meg get over the death of her mother thanks to a romance with a free-spirited Aussie rugby player (Luke Bracey) while Emma learns that cruel Eurotrash hunks are no match for her hometown honey (""Glee"" star Cory Monteith). Gomez doesnt have the big-screen pop of say Emma Stone but shes thoroughly convincing as both a small-town dreamer and a world-weary gorgon. Cassidy when dressed up in the films finery has a distinctly 80s look - picture Susan Blakeley guest-starring on ""Dynasty"" - while Meesters permanent look of constipation fits the dreary Meg just perfectly. Its too bad that talented British comic Catherine Tate has little to do here but literally keep the plot afloat as Cordelias posh aunt. Teen girls who want a vicarious overseas jaunt are advised to follow Emmas lead in one scene of ""Monte Carlo"" and watch ""To Catch a Thief"" instead. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Monte Carlo movie review By-the-numbers tween entertainment |       NJ.com comments Monte Carlo movie review By-the-numbers tween entertainment Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 01 2011 at 812 AM View/Post Comments Larry HorricksFrom left Leighton Meester Katie Cassidy and Selena Gomez in ""Monte Carlo."" First a typical Hollywood story When the novel ""Headhunters"" was published it was about four middle-aged women from Jersey prowling for rich husbands. Then the movies bought it and it became an in-progress script about three lonely 30-ish Midwesterners one of them Nicole Kidman. Now finally made its called ""Monte Carlo"" and its about the teenage Selena Gomez and two young Texans navigating some blended-family issues getting involved in mistaken-identity romances and hoping for nothing more than a sweet PG-rated kiss. If the original concept were any harder to find itd be showing up on milk cartons. Still now wholesome and harmless ""Monte Carlo"" has its uses. For mothers or grandmothers with a 10-year-old in tow and an afternoon to kill its as safe an outing as a lunch at Schraffts used to be with an order of salisbury steak and a dish of vanilla ice cream after. And its no tastier either. Movie Review Monte Carlo (PG) Fox (109 min.) Directed by Tom Bezucha. With Selena Gomez Leighton Meester Katie Cassidy. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains some very tame sensuality. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS Of course you could do worse for summer kiddie entertainment. (If you wasted money on ""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer"" you already have.) The scenery is pretty the actresses work hard and it all goes by fairly quickly if unmemorably. The new story has tween sweetheart Gomez as a brand-new high-school graduate who has been saving her waitressing tips to take a trip to Paris with best friend (and greasy-spoon colleague) Katie Cassidy a trashy-in-style-only firecracker. Except mom and new stepdad insist that she take along her joyless stepsister too -- a prim Leighton Meester -- for sibling bonding. And so lets get this party started -- also tons of corny soundtrack music travelogue shots (we actually get to see the Eiffel Tower along with the title card ""Paris"" in case were a little dim) and ooh-la-la jokes. Some of it is laughable -- and much of it not in a good way with cliches and condescension on every side. Corn-pone Cassidys big upscale dream for example is to live in a house with a dimmer switch. (She does everything but call a swimming pool ""the ce-ment pond."") And they must not have fed the character actors considering how much they chew the scenery. But Meester is actually quietly lovely as the supposedly uptight stepsister. And Gomez is great -- or at least half-great. Her cowgirl heroine doesnt have much to her but when the mistaken-identity plot requires her to play a bratty British heiress shes spot-on. Its not her fault that this movie is as trite as it is. Nor that she looks barely old enough to be in high school let alone have graduated. (She turns 19 this month.) Its her first (moderately) adult role and Gomez a carefully managed young star is taking it slow. But -- much as I hate to play to gender assumptions -- dont be surprised if Dad and Junior decide to take a pass on this family film and head to (the far worse) ""Transformers"" instead. Or if you forget it before youve even made it out to the parking lot.

While produced by Fox this high-concept comedy with a Princess and the Pauper twist seems more like one of Gomezs Disney Channel movies in which Cinderellas are transformed into royalty with a dash of (G-rated) romance fabulous fashion and dazzling smiles.Selena plays Grace a Texas teen using her hard-earned waitress savings for a summer trip to Paris between high school graduation and college in the fall. (She may be poor but the idea of using that money for college is a non-starter.) Accompanying her are her best friend the exuberant Emma (Melrose Place alumna Katie Cassidy) and new stepsister the repressed Meg (Gossip Girls Leighton Meester). Grace doesnt like her which means theyll have special bonding near the end. In another grab for the youth audience Glees Cory Monteith portrays Emmas hunky hometown honey.The big moment comes when Grace is mistaken for wealthy socialite Cordelia Winthrop Scott in Paris. Like a fairy godmothers magic wand the error gets our gals ushered out of their dreary digs into luxury suites with suitcases casually stuffed with multimillion-dollar jewels and magically unwrinkled ballroom dresses that fit all three with amazing Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants flair. The absurdities escalate as Grace is handed a ticket to fly to Monaco on a private plane which accommodates all three young women no questions or identification asked. They attend a ball where Grace falls for Theo (Pierre Boulanger) a princely fellow passionate about charitable work. Will he love her when she turns back from Cordelia to Grace? Really does he have a choice in a script contrived as cynically as this?Under the direction of Thomas Bezucha a former fashion executive turned writer and director the backdrops are pretty especially in Paris and Monaco. Local audiences should get a kick out of seeing Grand Prairies own Gomez in Dallas scenes (even if they were actually filmed in Budapest). But Gomez an appealing performer emanates a wistful sadness beneath forced cheer as if shed rather be somewhere else for much of this silliness.

Comments click to enlarge Monte Carlo Video Rated PG  108 minutes  2011 This light comedy is being marketed to teenage girls but its comparable to Woody Allens recent European-set features Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Midnight in Paris. Like those movies its a materialist fantasy of the continent in which a young woman from Texas is mistaken for an heiress and along with her blue-collar best friend and bookish step-sister whisked into a world of luxury. Yet the movie hits a surprising range of emotional grace notes including several moments of genuine regret and concludes with an understated moral lesson about the value of self-respect over social status something that would never happen in an Allen film. Thomas Bezucha (The Family Stone) directed; the seldom-cloying cast includes Selena Gomez Leighton Meester and Katie Cassidy.

Most rom-coms contain at least one gleeful shopping-spree sequence but a Princess-for-a-Day Flick stretches that fantasy of perfectly shod self-affirmation for two blinged-out hours usually via mistaken identity or magical plot twist and without ever having to pick up the tab. The only price that must be paid is the Princess Apology That deeply hypocritical moment a much like the aCrime Doesnat Paya coda to an Edward G. Robinson gangster flick a in which the chastened soulful Cinderella disavows her glitzy inauthentic persona and retreats with grateful self-knowledge back into her ordinary consumer self. Even within the manipulative Princess-for-a-Day genre Disney Channel product Selena Gomezs Monte Carlo is a chintzy knockoff. Never mind that the fantasy brand of Monte Carlo as a hot spot is dated at best (personally I think of the Chevy or maybe second-tier Vegas casino) the script is so dumb the only words with more than three syllables appear to be brand names. Justin Bieber canoodler Gomez plays the Texan high-school grad Grace who has dreamed of a Paris vacation. Shes so sweet kind and unoffensive that her decision to impersonate the British socialite Cordelia -- and jump on Cordelias private jet to Monte Carlo -- is as unconvincing as her faked accent. Graces con is abetted by two accomplices her constipated stepsister Meg played by a marginally more expressive Leighton Meester and her party-girl pal Emma played by Katie Cassidy whose role is an extended blonde joke. They each find a boy and so so many clothes. Tom Bezucha the director who perpetrated The Family Stone deploys an arsenal of product placement to subdue the girls. In the old-fogie gambling tax haven of Monte Carlo Grace Emma and Meg are battered by an artillery chest of name-brand cosmetics a Bulgari necklace armed with grenade-size sapphires and a blinding barrage of Oscar De La Rentas ball-gown satin. There are hunky love interests -- an aristocrat who buttons his shirt a studly Aussie who does not -- but character development cant compete with the lingering sensual pans over the merch which is the films real attraction anyway. Which is why the idea that theres anything like an ethical lesson hidden amid the shopping bags is so silly. ""You must be the change you want to see in the world"" -- Gandhis most bumper-stickered line -- is quoted twice. The first time is a commencement-speech tragedy the second is a self-righteous charity-auction farce. The film wallows in expensive clothes and locales but like a puff-piece celebrity profile wants you to have it both ways to ogle the glamour and admire the righteous soul thats purportedly beneath the surface but barely in evidence. (Its no wonder young stars like Gomez Anne Hathaway and Hilary Duff adore this genre.) The Princess Apology tacked on at the end purports to be all about finding the real you but teens arent exactly buying movie tickets to see films about real girls who cant afford all this awesome stuff. In the meantime theres the fantasy of pretending to be someone so much more fabulous.

(Larry Horricks/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday July 1 2011 400 AM Title Monte Carlo A Texas teen is mistaken for a British socialite. With Selena Gomez Leighton Meester. Director Thomas Bezucha. (149). PG mild language. At area theaters.If you can believe that gorgeous Disney superstar --- and Justin Bieber gf -- Selena Gomez might ever be an insecure outsider you are the perfect audience for ""Monte Carlo.""Also if you are a 12-year-old girl you are the perfect audience for ""Monte Carlo.""So that makes it easy really. Anyone who fits the above requirements will love Thomas Bezuchas featherweight fantasy based on Jules Basss novel ""Headhunters."" And anyone who doesnt can at least appreciate that such wholesome entertainment even exists.Gomez is if not entirely authentic perfectly adorable as Grace an unpopular diner waitress and recent high school grad whos been planning a big trip to Paris. Shes going with BFF Emma (Katie Cassidy) and at her parents insistence her uptight stepsis Meg (Leighton Meester).Alas the City of Light feels dark and dreary because they cant afford to do much. But then Grace discovers that she looks exactly like a spoiled British heiress named Cordelia (Gomez again). When the girls overhear that Cordelias skipping out on a charity ball in Monaco Grace decides to secretly impersonate her. Soon theyre hobnobbing with royalty falling for first loves and doing their very best not to get caught.Director and co-writer Thomas Bezucha shows no particular flair for either of his jobs. But kids are unlikely to focus on the terrible editing flat visuals or lack of character development. Theyll just see three adorable actresses--and a matching set of equally cute actors--playing dress-up in glossy wish-fulfillment style.Meanwhile chaperones wary of tween culture will get their own wish fulfilled the movie consistently discourages superficial values while promoting charitable attitudes. (Granted the entire plot revolves around a fraud. But everyone learns to take responsibility for their mistakes.) Equally important it never undermines its own heroines--a lesson incidentally that many grown-up rom-coms have yet to learn.Magic Moment When Gomez finally gets to face off against herself competing accents and all.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 01 2011 1201AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jun. 30 2011 400PM EDT Comments AA Monte Carlo strives to be Eat Pray Love for the Twilight generation. But despite its soul-searching pretensions the movie hinges on what is essentially a con - one bereft of tension and so sanitized for young female viewers that little room is left for temptation or humour or good old-fashioned summer shenanigans. Movies Monte Carlo The official trailer Actress and singer Selena Gomez attends the Monte Carlo screening in New York on June 23 2011. Mike Coppola/Getty Images Film Video Bieber dutiful boyfriend at Gomez premiere At least the flick delivers the scenery. And by that I mean the cute guys (including two new foreign heartthrobs) who get ample screen time to smoulder and behave like prince charmings (sorry no bad boys here). This snoozefest co-stars a trio of fetching gals plucked from TV fame. Disney Channel star Selena Gomez ( Wizards of Waverly Place) plays the earnest blank slate Grace a small-town high-school grad whose summer trip to Paris begins as a no-frills flop. While ducking into a swanky hotel to get out of the rain she is mistaken for bitchy British heiress Cordelia Winthrop Scott who has decided to skip a charity event shes expected to attend in Monte Carlo. In a blast of paparazzi flashbulbs Grace and her two travelling companions are whisked into a limo by a bunch of fawning French bellhops and soon land at the resort towns famed Hotel de Paris with a stack of luggage including everything a girl needs to play dress-up. The game is ostensibly sustained because Grace wants to see the event through - her doppelganger is supposed to auction off an expensive necklace. And of course theres a cute smart rich French boy (Pierre Boulanger) to impress. Gomez who turns 20 next year looks much younger than her age and has the thankless task of playing three roles - Grace Cordelia (despite a bad accent Gomez has the most fun here) and Grace pretending to be Cordelia. It feels like a struggle and the screenplay doesnt help. Graces slightly older companions have their own storylines. Emma played with casual charm by Katie Cassidy ( Melrose Place reboot) is a waitress with an anxious fiance ( Glees Cory Monteith) and a knack for embracing the moment. Gossip Girls Leighton Meester delivers the standout performance as Graces uptight stepsister Meg who gradually becomes the free spirit she is meant to be with the help of a handsome Aussie vagabond (Luke Bracey). Despite the recent obsession with the new royal Kate Monte Carlo seems tonally off the mark considering the naughty female-powered movies that have defined the summer so far like Bridesmaids and Bad Teacher - I mean even the silly tween-centric Judy Moody movie has more edge. But Monte Carlo didnt start off so tame; Headhunters a novel about four middle-aged New Jersey women who pretend to be heiresses in Monte Carlo was optioned over a decade ago. Jersey Shore meets the Bridesmaids on the Mediterranean? Now thats a European vacation.

Starring Selena Gomez Leighton Meester Cory Monteith Release Opened Jul 1 2011  Editorial Review European visit is saving GraceBy Stephanie MerryFriday July 1 2011In the digital age when youth-speak stereotypically translates to emoticons and acronymed interjections theres something unexpectedly heartening about watching ""Monte Carlo"" which follows a trio of young women who can string together full sentences made up of actual words. The teen-geared movie relies on age-old plot devices and storylines -- mistaken identities and a rags-to-riches Cinderella story are all part of a coming-of-age framework -- that are familiar territory. But its also dependable entertainment for young girls not to mention a movie parents should appreciate given its dearth of expletives and conspicuous absence of texting (let alone sexting). Grace (Selena Gomez also known as Justin Biebers cute-as-a-button girlfriend) lives in Texas a land of Dairy Queens diners and cowboy boots like something out of a William Eggleston photograph but dreams of traveling to Paris. Finally escaping what she might term the H-E-double-hockey-sticks of high school Grace plans a trip to France with her best friend Emma (Katie Cassidy) a boilerplate of a 20-something high school dropout complete with miniskirts platform heels and platinum hair. An initial kink in the pairs travel plans arrives in the form of Graces new stepsister who is forced by the girls parents to go along on the adventure to everyones chagrin. Meg (Leighton Meester of ""Gossip Girl"") is a wet blanket. She hasnt cracked a smile since her mother died some years ago and her favorite pastime appears to be reprimanding people.Upon landing in France the world travelers immediately apprehend that they have signed up for the wrong tour. Not only is their guide a shrill speed walker but their itinerary is so jam-packed that the girls get only a passing glimpse of Notre Dame and 20 minutes at the Louvre. Luckily they stumble upon a new excursion thanks to some auspicious timing. Graces striking resemblance to an infamous tabloid fixture and British socialite Cordelia Winthrop Scott gains the trio a private jet to Monte Carlo to enjoy the lifestyles of the rich and famous including eye-popping diamond jewelry polo matches designer ball gowns and an array of makeup that could rival the beauty closet at Elle magazines corporate offices.The three young women juggle their madcap charade with new love interests including the young Frenchman Theo (Pierre Boulanger) who in a Mr. Darcy-esque turn treats Grace like dirt before winning her over with his charm and accent. Meanwhile a dreamy Australian might be just the thing to help sourpuss Meg loosen up. While theres plenty of scenic eye candy including charming shots of the Eiffel Tower through the trees and the lovely red roofs set against the blue water overlooking Monte Carlo the movie could have benefitted from shaving about 20 minutes off. Theres no need to prolong the inevitable. Its clear how things will end but that doesnt change the fact that starry-eyed girls and rabid fans of Gomez will probably go gaga for the movie. It is ultimately a sweet story after all and a few scenes might even make them LOL. Contains objectionable aside from identity theft.

For a movie called ""Monte Carlo"" this one keeps the stakes pretty low. Earnest and predictable its the cinematic equivalent of a pop hit by star Selena Gomezs boyfriend Justin Bieber. Disney Channel star Gomez plays dual roles here -- primarily shes Grace Bennett a middle-class Texan whos been saving up her waitressing tips to visit Paris after high school graduation with her best friend Emma (Katie Cassidy) and Graces uptight stepsister Meg (Leighton Meester playing a declawed version of her ""Gossip Girl"" character). Their guided tour of France turns out to be a snooze so the three sneak into a luxury hotel where they catch sight of Cordelia Winthrop Scott (also Gomez) an icy European heiress whos a ringer for Grace. When they overhear the spoiled socialite scheming to ditch her hotel suite and her trip to Monaco to host a charity auction a plan is hatched. Grace will pretend to be Cordelia -- because really what are the odds the real heiress will show up in Monte Carlo? PHOTOS DISNEY STARS BRANCHING OUT Naturally stacks of designer luggage crammed with ball gowns makeup and eye-popping jewels ""borrowed"" from Cordelia yield a full-fledged princess fantasy for the small-town trio. Gomez puts on a vaguely British affect and tries to seem slightly less adorable for the heiress suspicious aunt (the reliably fun Catherine Tate). In a film where people say things like ""Well if you change your mind the train leaves at noon"" theres not much doubt a race-against-the-clock chase through Monacos colorful streets will ensue -- at noon. Or that Grace will fall for a charming young aristocrat (Pierre Boulanger) whos delighted that ""Cordelia"" turned out to be beaucoup nicer than in the tabloids. Equally nonsuspenseful is the question of whether Emma will learn to appreciate her good-hearted lunk of a boyfriend at home (Corey Monteith of ""Glee"" with dirt under his fingernails) after playing pretend among rich snobs who are mean to waitresses or whether Meg will let her hair down after she meets a Paul Hogan-lite Australian backpacker (Luke Bracey). In spite of its ham-handed plotting theres something likably retro about a film in which the harshest curse someone can muster is ""shoot"" and the worst behavior is Cordelia failing to tip the bellhop. Gomez and company seem straight out of one of the old Disney mistaken-identity films. With all the so-so accents on display here you almost expect them all to start talking like Hayley Mills. ""Monte Carlo"" also boasts a supporting cast of authentic mugging Frenchmen -- busboys chauffeurs and policemen -- who look as if theyd expected to wind up in a better-quality farce. But director Thomas Bezucha (""The Family Stone"") is too timid to let the high jinks rise to the level of Jerry Lewis wackiness. At one point Meester leans against a row of parked mopeds and knocks over . . . two of them. Why not the whole lot?

Her arrival in Monte Carlo is in accordance with the prophecy that all teenagers employed by the Disney Channel shall one day headline their own tween-friendly feature films. Also the Internet informs me that Selena Gomez is dating something called ""Justin Bieber"" and that this fact fills some of Justin Biebers female admirers with rage. That isnt relevant but I wanted to mention it because its amusing. Im too old and have too many Y chromosomes to be in Selena Gomezs target audience but I know a sunny and inoffensive comedy when I see one and Monte Carlo is one. It provides young girls with some harmless wish-fulfillment without talking down to them an increasingly rare quality in movies aimed at young people. Gomez plays Grace a wholesome 18-year-old Texas girl who has saved her waitressing money to take a post-graduation trip to Paris. Her companion will be her best friend Emma (Katie Cassidy) a rowdy blonde and high school dropout who works at the same diner. At the last minute Graces mother (Andie MacDowell) and stepfather (Brett Cullen) declare that her stick-in-the-mud stepsister 21-year-old Meg (Leighton Meester) will be tagging along too. Nobody wants this least of all Meg who isnt close to Grace and doesnt like Emma (or ""Texas Barbie"" as she calls her). As fate would have it the girls cross paths in Paris with one Cordelia Winthrop Scott a haughty British heiress who is filthy rich super-snotty and happens to be a dead ringer for Grace. (Gomez plays both roles.) The two look so much alike in fact that Grace is mistaken for her and winds up in her luxury hotel suite while the real Cordelia skips town to go partying. Meg is opposed to such impersonation shenanigans; Emma is very much in favor of them; good-girl Grace wavers but figures theres no harm in it just for tonight since the room is already paid for and Cordelia isnt using it anyway. Naturally this leads to a week of Grace being shuffled around to Cordelias charity fundraisers and polo matches and such including a stint in Monte Carlo flanked by her ""American friends."" The girls get to wear Cordelias fancy clothes and jewelry (her baggage arrived after she left) go to elegant balls mingle with the upper crust and maybe -- just maybe -- fall in love. Grace is romanced by Theo (Pierre Boulanger) a down-to-earth Monte Carlo socialite who thinks shes Cordelia and Meg meets a freewheeling Australian tourist named Riley (Luke Bracey). Emma who has a steady boyfriend (Cory Monteith) back in Texas goes out with a handsome prince (Giulio Berruti) but realizes the fancy life is not for her. The mistaken-identity/Parent Trap switcheroo premise is thank goodness not the focus of the story and the hijinks typically associated with such nonsense are kept to a minimum. Surprisingly all three of the female leads are given actual character arcs simple though they may be and emerge as sympathetic fully formed characters. The relationships between them -- between Grace and Meg Meg and Emma Emma and Grace -- are explored not with any dazzling insight perhaps but at least with honesty. We do have to swallow a lot of dumb stuff of course starting with the last-minute decision to force Meg to join the trip continuing through Emmas boyfriends spontaneous flight to Paris to chase after her and including the odd fact that Riley coincidentally runs into Meg in Paris and Monte Carlo. The movie followed a tortuous route to existence enduring many rewrites and overhauls before finally being directed by Thomas Bezucha (The Family Stone) and co-written by him April Blair and Maria Maggenti. (The novel it came from Jules Bass Headhunters was about four middle-aged New Jersey women who go to Monte Carlo and impersonate rich ladies in order to attract wealthy suitors.) The effects of all this tinkering are apparent yet the finished product is still decent respectable entertainment probably suitable for fans of Wizards of Waverly Place whatever that is.

"Monte Carlo misses the mark - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Monte Carlo misses the mark By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Monte Carlo is all about deja vu cobbling together elements from so many other sources it feels like movie stew. By Larry Horricks 20th Century Fox They just want to have fun Leighton Meester left Selena Gomez and Katie Cassidy are American girls who undertake a Parisian adventure. EnlargeClose By Larry Horricks 20th Century Fox They just want to have fun Leighton Meester left Selena Gomez and Katie Cassidy are American girls who undertake a Parisian adventure. Among the familiar ingredients a trio of mismatched American girls in France; a tour that races them through major Parisian attractions; a case of mistaken identity; girls dressing up in gorgeous clothes; and chaste summer romance. Its What a Girl Wants meets The Parent Trap meets The Lizzy McGuire Movie meets Roman Holiday meets The Prince and the Pauper. The movie is aimed at tweens so the girls-just-wanna-have-fun vibe is clear and present though some honest humanity is buried amid the high jinx. (One girl is grappling with the death of her mother.) Grace (Selena Gomez) has longed to see Paris for most of her 18 years saving her after-school waitressing tips. Also enraptured by the Parisian dream is her co-worker and best pal Emma (Katie Cassidy). Grace graduates from her small-town Texas high school and the pair is set to go. Graces mother (Andie MacDowell) and stepfather (Brett Cullen) insist that Graces responsible 21-year-old stepsister Meg (Leighton Meester) accompany them. Meg and Emma have a contentious history. Its unclear precisely why they dislike each other but it has something to do with Emma being a sassy blonde party gal and Meg being a smart brunette killjoy. Somehow it took five screenwriters to come up with this. Theres a recycled old-fashioned feel to what transpires. Paris is dispensed with early when their tour bus leaves them behind and Grace is mistaken for a spoiled British socialite. The older girls particularly Emma push Grace to play along. Grace resists for a few seconds then gets swept up in the rarefied social whirl. Handily her doppelganger has left the building. Monte Carlo   out of four Stars Selena Gomez Leighton Meester Cory Monteith Katie Cassidy Andie MacDowell Director Thomas Bezucha Distributor20th Century Fox Rating PG for brief mild language Running time 1 hour 49 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The girls avail themselves of snooty socialite Cordelia Winthrop-Scotts designer wardrobe private jet limousines and luxury hotel accommodations. The ethical implications of ""borrowing"" someones identity as well as her personal belongings are minimized for viewers because Winthrop-Scott is quickly established as obnoxious selfish and rude. In contrast Graces innocent goodness is ladled on thickly. She dons her lookalikes Bulgari jewels and Vera Wang gowns for a greater good embracing a cause -- raising money for a Romanian school -- that her evil twin dismisses. But as well-intentioned as were supposed to find Grace shes still guilty of identity theft and blithely gets away with it. The guys including Glees Cory Monteith as Emmas hometown boyfriend are just around for eye candy and to be sweetly smitten. Meg meets a hunky Aussie backpacker (Luke Bracey) who helps her loosen up Grace connects with idealistic Theo (Pierre Boulanger) and Emma realizes that the rich are just like you and me -- or maybe worse. Monte Carlo is a wish-fulfillment fantasy. (What luck The heiress clothes fit all three girls like a glove) But the secrets and lies are hardly enchanting and send a questionable message to young audiences.

Add glorious Euro scenery mistaken identity horses and Selena Gomez and youve got ""Monte Carlo"" which scores a direct hit with its target demo. Ask any tween-aged girl to name her interests and the list will almost invariably include fashion adventure and hanging with her BFFs. Add some glorious European scenery a case of mistaken identity horses a beach trip and a trio of rising starlets led by Selena Gomez and youve got ""Monte Carlo"" a frothy innocuous smorgasbord of girlhood wish fulfillment that scores a direct hit with its target demo. Probably the only way for Fox to prompt greater enthusiasm among preadolescent girls would be to give each of them a cell phone with an unlimited texting plan. With a resume spanning albums a hit series (Disneys ""Wizards of Waverly Place"") heavy-rotation rentals (""Beezus and Ramona"" ""Princess Protection Program"") and a social life that includes reported b.f. Justin Bieber Gomez is the virtual embodiment of 7-to-12-year-old female fantasy. That makes the fresh-scrubbed star ideal for ""Monte Carlo"" in which she finds capable support from the equally lovely Leighton Meester (""Gossip Girl"") and Katie Cassidy (""Taken""). Under the capable helming of Thomas Bezucha (""The Family Stone"") adapting Jules Bass novel with co-scribes April Blair and Maria Maggenti each girl gets her moment. Opening reel establishes a light comic tone stressing that Grace (Gomez) leads an ordinary life thats about to change. She works in a diner with her pal Emma (Cassidy) preps for her high-school graduation and longs to escape the condescending glares of the school snobs. It doesnt help that her parents (Brett Cullen Andie MacDowell) decide to send Graces priggish stepsister Meg (Meester) along on the European vacation Emma and Grace have planned for years. Desperate to keep Emma from leaving her b.f. Owen (""Glee"" heartthrob Cory Monteith) proposes but forgets the ring. Emma turns him down and he breaks up with her but at least she still has Paris ahead of her. The Paris they discover however isnt the one they dreamed about When their militaristic tour guide (Valerie Lemercier) speed-walks them through the Louvre and has them repeatedly circle the Arc de Triomphe (much funnier in ""Vacation"") the girls begin to suspect theyre missing something. Only the view from Sacre-Coeur and chance encounters with a hunky Aussie named Riley (Luke Bracey) offer hints of another side of France. Then in a Comedy Writing 101 scheme that apparently still feels fresh to the pics demo Grace decides to pose as the visiting British heiress Cordelia Winthrop-Scott (also Gomez) who has ditched Paris without informing her staff. Over Megs objections (and those of anyone desiring a reality check) the girls are promptly whisked away on a private jet to Monte Carlo where Cordelia is to be the guest of honor at the auction of a priceless necklace. The ruse leads to further complications involving Theo (Pierre Boulanger) a kind-hearted young man who falls for Cordelia/Grace and Cordelias aunt Alicia (Catherine Tate) who begins to suspect shes an impostor. Inescapable shades of ""Roman Holiday"" appear as Riley and Meg speed away on a scooter while Meesters cinched-waist dress (designed by Shay Cunliffe) directly recalls that of the young Audrey Hepburn. Older audience members will appreciate another nod to Hollywood (and real-life) royalty when a TV happens to air a French-dubbed version of ""To Catch a Thief."" If it sounds like a lot to juggle it is but for the most part Bezucha handles the multiple storylines successfully bringing the threads together for a big reveal in which Grace must confront her actions. Still something has to give and pic gives short shrift to a thread in which Owen turns up in search of Emma forcing him to wander Paris for what seems like an eternity. Pacing is generally solid abetted throughout by Michael Giacchinos lively score. The only real lapses are the romantic scenes which feel almost lethargic in contrast with the brisk energy pulsating thoughout the pic; Gomez Meester and Cassidy have so much chemistry together its difficult to sustain the same giddy momentum with their respective romantic partners. Although some of the Gallic elements -- brusque locals snippy waiters inscrutable menus -- are exaggerated for comic effect there are others the movie gets just right. Production designer Hugo Lucyzc-Wyhowski perfectly captures the incongruities of Parisian accommodations with the girls hotel which advertises their tiny room as the ""junior ambassador suite."" Lensing by Jonathan Brown effectively conveys the warm light of summer on the Riviera; though some scenes were filmed in Paris and Monaco Budapest doubles for Monte Carlo. Music supervisor Liza Richardson has assembled an upbeat soundtrack designed for maximum downloading capped off with a final track by -- who else? -- Selena Gomez.

TWITTER The juryas still out on Selena Gomezas bigscreen potential; sheas not very appealing or magnetic here nor does she display any particular comic gifts in the film out Friday. Flat champagne for the under-aged Monte Carlo lays out yet another banquet of materialist fantasies for aspiring American princesses cloaked in reminders to obey your conscience and not to forget your true self. Fair enough but after a suitably air-headed opening stretch this Fox release begins taking the romantic yearnings and regretful second thoughts of its girly threesome rather more seriously than might be to the taste of Selena Gomezs core fan group which would perhaps prefer to see the girls just having more fun. Selena Gomez Five Things You Didnt Know About the Monte Carlo Star An earnest Texas kid whos saved waitressing tips to treat herself to a high school graduation trip to Paris Grace (Gomez) will be traveling not only with best pal Emma (Katie Cassidy) a high-spirited gal not prone to excess reflection but also as an unwanted chaperone with her drippy stepsister Meg (Leighton Meester) a perennially down-in-the-dumps 21-year-old so morose she could cast a pall on a dinner party hosted by Noel Coward. Selena Gomez Debby Ryan to Appear in Disney Channels Prankstars With Emma rebuffing a last-second marriage proposal from nervous boyfriend Owen (Cory Monteith) the trio jets off to the City of Light where their guide provides a tour so ludicrously accelerated that the wonders of Paris are offered as so much fast food; it all makes you wish you were watching Midnight in Paris for a second time instead of this. PHOTOS Hollywoods new leading ladies But there is relief in store for the girls if not so much for the viewer when Grace is mistaken for zillionairess Cordelia Winthrop Scott an extravagantly snooty Brit whos imminently due to preside over a charity event in Monaco. Without a moment to protest Grace and her willing entourage are swooped onto the lookalikes private jet and installed in the Grimaldi Suite at the infinitely swank Hotel de Paris where Monte Carlo suddenly becomes their oyster. Affecting a posh English accent Grace is tended to by a sweet young Frenchman (Pierre Boulanger) whose family has lent its name to the auction her other ornament being an elaborate necklace the disappearance of which comes to figure prominently in the plot. For their parts Emma is given reason to question her loyalty to Owen by a blindingly handsome Italian (Giulio Berruti) and Meg is shaken out of her stupor by rugged Aussie backpacker Riley (Luke Bracey). Although she gets by for a while by mostly keeping her trap shut Graces imposture soon wears dangerously thin and the combination of mistaken identity missing jewels upscale European settings hotel room slapstick and momentary amatory wistfulness combine to create the impression that director and co-screenwriter Thomas Bezucha (The Family Stone) is attempting an aspirational Blake Edwards romantic farce albeit far more wished for than achieved. Especially in the final stretch the characters go through crises of conscience that force them even in this contrived context to assess whats truly important to them and Grace is obliged to make a very public confession while Cordelia gets what passes for a comeuppance. Even as she is the center of attention here in a double role the jury is still out on Gomezs bigscreen potential; shes not very appealing or magnetic here nor does she display any particular comic gifts for this sort of broad fare. Cassidys lines are mostly low-grade wisecracks while Meester becomes an increasingly welcome presence the more Meg lightens up.

MC-023 EEEven an elevator ride has intriguing and unexpected consequences for the vacationing Emma (Katie Cassidy left) Meg (Leighton Meester) and Grace (Selena Gomez) in ""Monte Carlo."" Photo Larry Horricks Twentieth Century Fox Monte Carlo review At least we have Paris 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Monte Carlo Romantic comedy. Starring Selena Gomez Leighton Meester and Katie Cassidy. Directed by Thomas Bezucha. (PG. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The ingredients should have been there for a diverting bit of light escapism but ""Monte Carlo"" gets it all wrong. Its unpleasant where it should be pleasant convoluted where it should be streamlined anxiety provoking where it should be easy and long long long - at least 20 minutes longer than it has a right to be. Three young women go on a trip to Paris from their hometown in Texas - and right there that should have been something. Theyre going to Paris which means youre going to Paris too. There are worse things. But no two of the young ladies dont like each other. One (Leighton Meester) is priggish the other (Katie Cassidy) is a free spirit. And then theres our heroine Grace played by Selena Gomez who looks like shes about 14. Grace has dreamed of Paris all her life but somehow all this advance thought hasnt prevented her from signing on to a cheap tour and booking a fleabag hotel. Related Stories Monte Carlo Then destiny strikes and the plot kicks in when the girls wander into a chic neighborhood and everyone mistakes Grace for a brainless jet-setting socialite someone on the order of Paris Hilton. Suddenly the girls find themselves in the royal suite and on a private jet to Monte Carlo. But wait just in case youre enjoying this theres the priggish one Meg (Meester) to remind everyone at every turn that they shouldnt be doing this that this is dangerous that this is a big mistake. It could not have been fun for Meester to be cast as a wet blanket. The rest of the movie is a lot of variations on the theme of mistaken identity. Gomez plays both Grace and the socialite and shes adequate in the sense of not embarrassing herself. But of the three leads the only one with definite comic talent is Cassidy who is the daughter of David and the granddaughter of Jack. (You know like the Barrymores Lite.) She is comically inventive and spontaneous and has a lively face. But if you really want to talk about comedy ""Monte Carlo"" contains two of the best comedians in Europe Britains Catherine Tate wasted in a straight role as the socialites aunt; and Frances Valerie Lemercier a wonderful writer-director who has a handful of lines as a tour guide here. These women are brilliant hysterically funny one-of-a-kind talents but ""Monte Carlo"" is intent on keeping that a secret. Anyway two-thirds into the proceedings the plot is a tangle of social obligations polo matches four guys involved with three women and confusion over a necklace. And yes every last one of those things has to be worked out before they turn off the projector and let you go home. Its a strange thing the line between exciting and stress-inducing. ""Monte Carlo"" actually generates stress without creating excitement. Its the difference between wishing the characters well and just wishing they would stop.

Not only can you spot Alfred Hitchcocks 1955 To Catch a Thief playing on a hotel television in the background of one scene but everything from the tony Cote dAzur setting to a case of missing jewelry to a late-night romantic rendez-vous backlit by fireworks is meant to evoke the classic caper and its breezy spirit. Gomezs character is even named Grace -- you know as in Grace Kelly. Its no surprise to find out that the baby-faced actress is no Ms. Kelly (compare Justin Bieber to Prince Rainier at your own leisure). But while both Gomez and the film sorely lack the effortless charisma of their exemplars theyre not entirely without their own charms. Grace and her traveling companions Emma and Meg (played by Gossip Girls Katie Cassidy and Leighton Meester) have left their home in Podunk Texas for a one-week tour of Paris. And before you can say either ""hot dang"" or ""sacre bleu"" they find themselves embroiled in a sub-Olsen Twins scenario of lookalikes and mistaken identities. Pretending to be the haughty socialite Cordelia Scott Winthrop (also played by Gomez with some vague approximation of a posh accent) Grace infiltrates the raised-pinky domain of the European elite a sparkly world of polo charity auctions and handsome French boys with even handsomer bank account figures. Its all very silly and contrived but its also airy and agreeably laid-back not unlike a decent vacation. A pitch-perfect score from Losts musical maestro Michael Giacchino calls to mind those older Riviera-set films even if his notes are often -- and unwelcomely -- interrupted by a series of forgettable pop songs. When the plots more farcical elements start snowballing and the girls playful fraud turns to accidental grand larceny and kidnapping theres enough comedic energy to carry us through to the requisite happy ending without feeling like weve been run too hard through the cliche mill. Monte Carlo is undoubtedly a trifle but its still kind of nice for a summer movie to try charming us instead of just bludgeoning us into submission.

"Monte Carlo review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Selena Gomez-led trio make the trip worth it in Monte CarloMonte Carlo a 2.5 starsJune 30 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticLeighton Meester Selena Gomez and Katie Cassidy live like royalty in ""Monte Carlo.""So ""Monte Carlo"" turns out to be a lot easier to take than both ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" and ""Larry Crowne."" You never know. Heres the sort of hardened show business veteran we have in Selena Gomez who spent two seasons way back in her preteens on ""Barney amp; Friends."" We have the star of Disney Channels ""Wizards of Waverly Place."" We have the star of Disneys TV movie ""Princess Protection Program."" We have a hardworking vocalist whose first album came out in 2009. We have the woman who launched her own Kmart clothing line. Well. Hers and Kmarts. And heres the nice thing. Unlike a few other well-drilled young actress-singers we could name such as the one whose name rhymes with ""Riley Myrus"" Gomez knows how to relax on camera. In ""Monte Carlo"" she plays Grace a graduating small-town high school Texas girl who dreams of Paris. That dream comes true with a caveat She and fellow waitress pal Emma (Katie Cassidy) end up traveling with a late-addition third wheel Graces scold of a stepsister Meg (Leighton Meester). Adapted from Jules Bass novel ""Headhunters"" ""Monte Carlo"" leans hard in the early going on tiresome bickering between Meg and Emma characters in their early 20s while Gomezs 18-year-old Grace keeps the peace even as their package tour starts feeling like a chore. Then bigger complications The threesome gets separated from the group after an Eiffel Tower visit. And Grace is mistaken for a snotty British socialite (also played by Gomez) for whom she is a dead ringer. Then its off to Monte Carlo on the socialite ruse for boys boys boys. Emma falls in with a louche playboy but her heart yearns for her Texas sweetheart (Cory Monteith). Meg still grieving the death of her mother finds a sunny Australian (Luke Bracey) to improve her outlook. Grace fakes her way through polo matches and deals with her attraction to a French boy (Pierre Boulanger). Disguises deceptions -- you could call the narrative of ""Monte Carlo"" Shakespearean but I prefer to consider Shakespeares romantic comedies as ""Selena Gomez-esque."" Director and co-writer Thomas Bezucha lacks visual panache and in fact leaves most of the panache in general to composer Michael Giacchinos swank and charming ditties and montage accompaniments. Still the characters and the film grow on you. Meester more or less steals it. She plays the character undergoing the most compelling transformation and her comic touch is both deft and subtle. ""Monte Carlo"" is nothing much but it leaves your soul un-crushed and this week especially its cause for a celebration-ette. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG (for brief mild language) Cast Selena Gomez (Grace); Katie Cassidy (Emma); Leighton Meester (Meg); Luke Bracey (Riley); Cory Monteith (Owen); Pierre Boulanger (Theo); Catherine Tate (Aunt Alicia) Credits Directed by Thomas Bezucha; written by Bezucha April Blair and Maria Maggenti; based on the novel ""Headhunters"" by Jules Bass; produced by Denise Di Novi Alison Greenspan and Nicole Kidman.

It goes something like this Take three young women of various temperaments (and/or hair colors). Send them on a mission (and/or to a destination) where they will learn about life (and/or one another) and find a partner (and/or the error of their ways). More about Monte Carlo >> Monte Carlo a cheery teen comedy with Selena Gomez Leighton Meester and Katie Cassidy carries on the studio tradition that includes such classics as How to Marry a Millionaire Three Coins in the Fountain and Where the Boys Are. For girls of a certain age (and their mothers) Monte Carlo hits the sweet spot. Grace (Gomez) a recent high school graduate and Emma (Cassidy) are Texas hash-house waitresses who for a year have pooled their tips for a Paris vacation. As Emma is slightly older and wilder than Grace (and has a boyfriend too played by Cory Monteith of Glee) Graces mom and stepdad designate Graces older stepsister Meg (Meester) to chaperone. Even before the gals take off tensions threaten to ground the trio. Uptight Meg still grieving the loss of her mother thinks Emma flighty and frivolous. Grace unhappy that her mother has remarried thinks Meg an interloper in her family and on her vacation. Emma a good-time gal thinks Grace insufficiently adventurous and Meg overly judgmental. After they land Emma and Meg are frustrated that Grace has booked a budget tour with lousy accommodations and even lousier food. How do you say ""hate triangle"" in French? Mal voyage gives way to bon voyage when they miss their bus get caught in a downpour and take refuge in a four-star hotel where humble Grace is mistaken for Cordelia Winthrop Scott a spoiled heiress (is there any other kind in movies?). Think Paris Hilton with a British title and a permanent sneer. When they see the luxurious suite awaiting Cordelia the girls risk impersonating an aristocrat for a night. In mistaken-identity movies thats not breaking the law its observing the narrative rules. Besides Cordelias designer duds and footwear are a perfect fit for these girls of wildly different frames and you know what they say about if the shoe fits. When the morning after a limo comes to fetch ""Cordelia"" for a private jet to Monte Carlo where she is expected for a charity polo match and ball the daredevil Emma encourages the stepsisters to go with the flow. They do all the way to the Mediterranean principality where love and luxe await. The actresses are appealing the settings photogenic (Budapest doubles for Monte Carlo) and the clothes ideal for a triple-Cinderella fantasy. Its not art but it is entertaining.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Selena Gomez is almost 19 but she still has the face of a cookie thats not done baking. Its big though not quite as big as her hair and the cleverest thing that the makers of ""Monte Carlo do with both is make them suitable for a Givenchy collection from 1960-something. Honestly the whole movie is from 1960-something. Gomez plays Grace an angelic Texan who works her way to Paris before entering New York University and winds up impersonating a bitchy British heiress en route to the French Riviera. The location titles look borrowed from ""Gidget Goes to Rome and the deluge of Muzak is sub-Bacharach.Grace makes the trip with her older country-fried best friend Emma (Katie Cassidy) and Meg (Leighton Meester) Graces uptight 21-year-old stepsister who for some reason is mad at Emma. They spend a few scenes bickering. Then it begins raining hunks and out come the hugs and Im-so-sorrys. If the score doesnt put you to sleep the wholesomeness would. This is the sort of movie in which if Alfred Hitchcocks ""To Catch a Thief is on TV the answer to ""What are you watching? is ""Grace Kelly.But wholesomeness in itself isnt a crime. And were I a certain 12-year-old girl ""Monte Carlo would be a giant frosted pastry even if that pastry tastes suspiciously like Gomezs 2009 Disney Channel Original Movie ""Princess Protection Program. My favorite thing about ""Monte Carlo is the way it occasionally mixes some enchantment into all the obviousness. Like when the ladies respective beaus take them out for an evening of fun. Louis Armstrongs ""La Vie en Rose plays during a fireworks show that the women watch in different states of glee. The camera gazes down at Meester who leaps skyward at a nightclub in bliss. It finds an enraptured Cassidy on a yacht and wearing No. 2 yellow.I dont remember what Gomez was doing. Even in two roles shes not yet terribly compelling as the focal point of a narrative. (The cookies still in the oven.) Its smart to trifurcate the story which is credited to April Blair Maria Maggenti and the movies director Thomas Bezucha and is based on the book ""Headhunters by the animation producer Jules Bass. Meester and Cassidy have to do things like inch along hotel ledges and race down the stairs of the Eiffel Tower. Their work is not entirely thankless. But Im afraid some girls will leave persuaded that Gomez just has really cool babysitters.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris.

Monte Carlo Director Thomas Bezucha. Cast Selena Gomez Leighton Meester Katie Cassidy. Rating PG for brief mild language. This weeks new movie releases Teen movies Its a star vehicle for Selena Gomez the Disney Channel actress singer and gal pal of Justin Bieber and at times it plays like a super-sized very special episode of a tween sitcom. Nobody markets their stars like Disney so there is a built-in audience for the film and its probably a safe bet that the younger end of Gomezs target audience will find the story of mistaken identity cute. If youre finishing up junior high or older youll probably feel otherwise. But director and co-writer Thomas Bezucha keeps things moving fast enough and the tone sufficient breezy that its not an unpleasant experience even when youre old enough to roll your eyes at the plot twists. Grace (Gomez) is finally graduating from high school in the small Texas town where she grew up. Shes saved for a post-graduation trip to Paris which shes taking with Emma (Katie Cassidy) the high-school dropout who she works with at a diner (""Texas Barbie"" one character calls her). But the night before the big trip Graces stepfather springs a surprise To the delight of no one they will be accompanied by Meg (Leighton Meester) Graces condescending stepsister. Once in France the trip turns to disaster thanks to a hurry-up tour service. The girls sit out a storm in the lobby of a luxury hotel where they learn that Grace is a dead ringer for the snooty tabloid-magnet heiress Cordelia Winthrop Scott (Gomez again). Cordelia is sufficiently spoiled enough to skip out on a charity event in her honor jet-setting to some other locale to party with her pals. At first reluctantly and then with relish Grace steps into Cordelias shoes - and dresses and million-dollar necklaces. Soon Grace and her friends are off to Monte Carlo living someone elses good life. From there its one implausible scenario after another with some young-adult romance thrown in for good measure. Grace falls for charity-fundraiser host Theo (Pierre Boulanger) who thinks hes squiring around Cordelia. Emma falls for an arrogant prince (Giulio Berruti) but truly loves good ol boy Owen (Cory Monteith) back in Texas. And Meg is dragged out of her shell by Australian adventure-seeker Riley (Luke Bracey). The ruse cant last of course and neither can the limited charms of the film. It all gets sappy and do-goody and the premise never holds water in the first place. But Meester in particular is engaging much more so than Gomez (so for that matter is Cassidy). But as movies built around Disney stars go you could do worse which is a nice way of saying its not as bad as you might have expected. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.
