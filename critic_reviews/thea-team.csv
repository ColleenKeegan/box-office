"A-Team The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; a-team-the ) A-Team The (United States 2010) June 11 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The A-Team represents the motion picture industrys male-oriented answer to such franchises as Sex and the City and Twilight. To combat the new wave of estrogen-powered movies Fox has fallen back on a tried-but-true formula the adrenaline-and-testosterone cocktail. The vehicle for this volatile mix is a revived 80s TV show that has been resurrected with its blend of tongue-and-cheek humor and over-the-top action intact. Im not sure many were clamoring for a new iteration of The A-Team but the premise is a solid match for two hours of dumb plot and dumber action. The production offers a level of non-intellectual entertainment although the true action junkie may find the buzz dulled somewhat by director Joe Carnahans embrace of ""modern"" action techniques with fast cuts and a constantly moving camera often making it tough to figure out what the hells going on in the midst of a pitched battle. In comic book parlance this is an ""origin"" story explaining how a group of characters gets to a familiar point. In the TV series the A-Team was an elite group of mercenaries ex-military types who were wrongly accused of a crime they did not commit. The A-Team provides the back-story although attempting to pay more than cursory attention to the plot is not advisable. The purpose of the razor-thin narrative is to introduce the characters provide them with some good one-liners and - most important of all - allow for all sorts of mayhem. Michael Bay one suspects would be proud. The A-Team is comprised of four classic characters (at least to the extent that anything from 80s TV can be considered ""classic""). The gruff smart leader is Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson) who lives by his motto of loving it when a plan comes together. He is joined by the mohawked behemoth B.A. Baracus (Quinton Rampage Jackson) who provides the muscle; cocky Templeton Faceman Peck (Bradley Cooper) who is easily distracted by a pretty face; and Mad Murdock (Sharlto Copley) an unbalanced but brilliant pilot. An elite unit of the military in Iraq they are framed for stealing counterfeit engraving plates and sent to prison. With the connivance of CIA operative Lynch (Patrick Wilson) they escape to clear their names. To accomplish that goal however they must evade pursuit by a military team led by Lieutenant Sosa (Jessica Biel) and track down a dangerous underground operative named Pike (Brian Bloom). The A-Team takes place in the kind of alternate cartoon-inspired universe where the laws of physics are frequently suspended on a whim and in which the bad guys (more often than not) cant shoot straight. The only time a member of the A-Team is injured by a bullet occurs as a result of friendly fire. There are red herrings and close calls but such is the stuff of B-movies. Nonstop action holds a certain undeniable appeal but Carnahan occasionally spoils the fun by employing the jittery approach to presenting action scenes. I have seen worse but there are occasions during the course of The A-Team when its necessary to wait until the smoke has cleared to determine precisely what has happened. Its also worth noting that although The A-Team boasts wall-to-wall action theres not much in the way of suspense. The campy humor helps to compensate however. This isnt one of those cheesy TV shows that has been re-imagined with an unwarranted seriousness for the big screen. Carnahan nails the appeal of The A-Team to a ""T."" The new cast does an admirable job aping the old one. Liam Neeson who has recently begun appearing in a number of low-intelligence high-profile motion pictures is suitably wise and witty as the A-Teams elder statesman although he lacks the panache of George Peppard. Wrestler Quinton Jackson does a credible imitation of Mr. T - an approach that allows his apparently limited acting skills to be camouflaged. The Hangovers Bradley Cooper incorporates elements of Dirk Benedicts Faceman into his characterization and there are times when The Districts Sharlto Copley appears to be channeling Dwight Shultz. (According to the IMDb credits list both Benedict and Shultz make cameos but either those appearances didnt make the final cut or I blinked and missed them.) The sex appeal comes from Jessica Biel who has shown in other roles that she can act. Here shes strictly eye candy. One minor disappointment is the underuse of the original Mike Post/Pete Carpenter A-Team theme - one of the best of the 80s - an upbeat march that could have been employed to excellent effect in the foreground rather than being relegated to background snippets. (Consider how the ""Mission Impossible"" music was used in that big-budget motion picture.) Instead we get a generic and instantly forgettable score from Alan Silvestri. Still such quibbles aside this movie feels like one might expect from a major movie rendering of a ""guilty pleasure"" TV show with the right amount of cheese to go along with the adrenaline and testosterone. Had the action sequences been better framed and presented this might have been one of the summers mindless high points. As it is its a passable diversion. The plan came together although not as well as it might have.

Doug Curran/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of It probably wont matter to its core audience that ""The A-Team"" doesnt make a lick of sense. As I recall the 1980s TV show its based on didnt make a lot of sense either. It may not even matter that its not very good. What matters in the end what always matters in these Type A flicks is how many explosions there are and how loud. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? By this reckoning and only this ""The A-Team"" rates an A. In every other respect its yet another steroid-pumped thrill ride targeting young males who want something else from life besides steel-cage mixed-martial arts matches on cable. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Liam Neeson stars in 1980s revamp of The A-Team. (Too bad theres not a plot). Funny thing a mixed martial arts champ Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson shows up in Mr. Ts ""B.A."" Baracus role. Alas his acting skills or to be more exact his enunciation skills make Mr. T sound like John Gielgud. [Editors note The original version identified Jackson simply as a martial artist.]For a while I thought something was wrong with the theaters sound system - I couldnt make out a word he was saying. But I had no trouble hearing the other actors though their dialogue was equally disposable. My guess is that the co-writer/director Joe Carnahan was afraid that if he criticized Jackson hed get hit real hard upside the head.On second thought ""Rampage"" Jackson gives one of the finest debut performances in Hollywood history.The original A-Team members were Vietnam vets; now theyre veterans of the Iraq war. ""Hannibal"" Smith (Liam Neeson) is the swaggering honcho; Bradley Cooper is ""Face"" Peck a master con artist and it follows as surely as night follows day irresistible to women; Sharlto Copley the memorable maniac from ""District 9"" is the goony bird ""Howling Mad"" Murdock. And Jackson as I said is the teams elocution instructor. (On third thought I choose to live dangerously.)The ""plot"" has something to do with how the A-Team goes in for some heavy-duty payback after being double-crossed stripped of their ranks and locked in the hoosegow. Their chief adversary is an ice-cold CIA creep played by Patrick Wilson. For some reason - maybe its the smart tailoring and the lethal purr of his intonations - he reminded me of a Wall Street bad guy. Too bad he wasnt. The movie business needs a new species of villain and the CIA is very old news. Memo to Hollywood Wall Street not K Street.Jessica Biel who might as well have ""Movies Sex Appeal"" tattooed on her forehead or somewhere shows up as a military investigator. She doesnt once crack a smile which gives you an idea of just how serious this actress is. She looks very good in sunglasses though.My favorite moment of deep think comes when Baracus who has temporarily forsworn violence - well not violence exactly just killing and squashing - receives a minitutorial from his team leader in the error of his ways. Contrary to popular belief Baracuss newfound hero Gandhi justified the use of violence. Its true. ""Hannibal"" says so. You can look it up.Lets just be thankful that Carnahan instead of redoing ""The A-Team"" didnt remake ""Gandhi."" The Ganges would have run red. Pacifism is for wussies.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> The A-Team amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Joan Rivers A Piece of Work The Karate Kid >> The A-Team The A-Team is ready to rock--make that impatient. This sweaty happy cartoon spectacle cant stay still for better and worse. The fights are chopped into a blur of fists and snaps the smiles stay big and as soon as Colonel Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson) announces that hes got a plan we see it unfold in the future as though the film simply cant handle its own suspense. Its a summer rollercoaster and a fine one heavy on biceps and aggression and--crucially--the zinging chemistry between its four leads. Theyve all been smartly cast Neesons intelligence crackles across his face like desert lightning; Sharlto Copleys lunatic Murdock argues that the South African star of District 9 might pull off a Hollywood character actor career Bradley Cooper remains charming and cocky and UFC champ Quentin ""Rampage"" Jackson makes B.A. Baracus a teddy bear with bite. Hes got the right energy and the camera likes him well enough but this isnt yet his break out performance--for one he smashes all his words together when he talks. The only word we can ever make out is ""Fool"" and annoyingly writer-director Joe Carnahan and co-writers Brian Bloom and Skip Woods make Jackson wedge it in every sentence--within 30 minutes were about to crack some skulls. With a script this relentless and four actors who look like theyre having fun this is a June blockbuster that wont leave you feeling bloated and cheap like youve had too much popcorn. Jessica Biel comports herself well as a brainy beautiful Army captain but the surprise stand out is Patrick Wilson. Usually the handsome Watchmen actor is cast as a pitiable suburban husband. Here hes a preening CIA agent with enough ego to get everyone killed--a man you love to hate in a flick youll hate to love. At least a little.

The big-screen A-Team is every bit as ridiculous and kitschy as the original. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 11 2010 556 PM The A-Team Was this movie scripted by 8-year-old boys? By Dana Stevens The A-Team If the first of this weeks 80s-derived summer blockbusters The Karate Kid wrestles with the question of how to honor the memory of a beloved cult movie the second one The A-Team (20th Century Fox) faces a very different problem. How do you justify revisiting a 25-year-old TV show that was pretty much disposable junk from the get-go? Lets face it Whatever fond memories of the series any of us might have probably have less to do with the show itself than with the self-mocking kitsch it engendered during its run. I vividly recall a friends Mr. T talking keychain that alternated between two of the Mohawk-sporting behemoths catchphrases ""I pity the fool"" and ""Dont make me mad."" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Still The A-Team has everything a production team bereft of original content could ask for nostalgic value widely recognizable protagonists drawn in cartoonishly broad strokes and a pretext for extracting a maximum of action from a minimum of plot. The whole point of The A-Team was to deliver a ridiculously outsized finale Each week the four titular soldiers of fortune escaped from whatever warehouse they found themselves trapped in by jerry-rigging a vehicle with explosives and barreling through billowing fireballs to PG-rated safety. (With rare exceptions none of the shows bad guys were killed or seriously harmed.) The A-Team played as if scripted by two 8-year-old boys banging their action figures together ""Pow"" ""Kablammo"" ""Curses"" ""Victory"" In its better moments the film version captures the goofy energy of juvenile commandos at play; at its worst its as if the 8-year-olds got final cut. Advertisement In this updating the foursome are no longer Vietnam veterans framed for ""a crime they didnt commit"" but Army Rangers working for a Special Forces unit in Baghdad framed for a crime they still didnt commit. In whats become franchise-reboot orthodoxy The A-Team begins as an origin story with the man who will become the ringleader Col. Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson) rounding up former rangers for his team. B.A. Baracus (Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson) the driver provides the muscle. Templeton ""Face"" Peck (Bradley Cooper) is the handsome sweet-talker whose way with the ladies gets him alternately into and out of trouble. And H.M. ""Howling Mad"" Murdock (Sharlto Copley) the teams pilot is not just a daredevil but a certified madman--he must be liberated from a military asylum in order to join the team. Shortly after arriving in Iraq the boys are unfairly blamed for--I believe I have this right--colluding in a counterfeiting scheme to print American dollars at the Iraqi mint. Theyre placed in custody escape spectacularly and spend the rest of the movie on the run from a smarmy CIA agent (Patrick Wilson) and a military investigator (Jessica Biel) whos also Faces ex-girlfriend. Anything else I say about the plot will probably be wrong because all exposition is hastily shouted over the din as the team skims across a lake in a speedboat or hurtles toward earth in an airborne tank suspended from a parachute. (Why was the tank on a plane in the first place? See above re 8-year-olds.) That scene with the plummeting tank is so ridiculous that it does achieve a kind of glory defying the laws of physics with the logic of a Wile E. Coyote stunt. And Ill admit to loving Liam Neesons late-career makeover as an action hero. He seems as at home here as he seemed in Taken; with his imposing bulk and hammerheadlike jutting brow you can believe him as the its-so-crazy-it-just-might work brains behind the operation. Not many actors can loom menacingly and twinkle at the same time. Unlike the series this movie racks up a ruthless body count especially during a massively scaled and supremely incoherent showdown in a port stacked high with shipping containers. The brutality is briefly and absurdly cut short when Baracus has a spiritual crisis in jail and resolves never to take another human life. But Hannibal soothingly demonstrates how the works of Mahatma Gandhi can be read as both con and pro on the killing issue and the action resumes. Advertisement Directed and co-written by Joe Carnahan the two-bit Tarantino who made Narc and Smokin Aces The A-Team seems to have been made with enthusiasm if not craft. Scooping up The A-Team as a property worthy of updating may have been a cynical move on the part of the producers (who include among others Tony and Ridley Scott) but they found a director whose breathless hyperkinetic style is for better or worse suited to the material. Like Coopers lady-killing character Face The A-Team is utterly convinced of its own lovability even as it strains our credibility abuses our patience and punishes our eardrums.  The idea of turning a less-than-legendary series like The A-Team into a movie scrapes pretty close to the bottom of the remake barrel. Can you scrape even lower?

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 10 2010 1244PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English THE A-TEAM Directed by Joe Carnahan Written by Joe Carnahan Brian Bloom Skip Woods Starring Liam Neeson Bradley Cooper Jessica Biel Classification PG Working on the unassailable assumption that trite makes right The A-Team starts with a travelling shot across a vast expanse of land perhaps the most repeated opening gambit in the annals of movies. Of course speaking of repetitive the picture itself is one more iteration of a fail-safe ploy Disinter a pop TV series with brand recognition (the eighties are a favourite digging ground these days) and trust that the revivals demographic appeal will include the aging original viewers plus with a few updates the younger crowd too. Cant lose - trite makes right and then it makes money. From there the casting is a no-brainer. Pity the foo who cant see the design in this cross-section The veteran Liam Neeson captains the Team a solid actor hired to reassure the grey-beards in the audience; handsome Bradley Cooper fresh off his box-office killing in The Hangover flutters hearts in the lothario role; Sharlto Copley is the wacky loose cannon in the mix his face (if not name) recognizable from his outing in the popular and Oscar-nominated District 9; and in the Mr. T slot another recruit from the ring a certain Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson guaranteed to tickle the youthful fancy of all those UFC fans. As for the female eye-candy hey Jessica Biel will do. Now for the updates. Back in the day the Teams quartet of crack Army Rangers got unjustly framed for some ill-doing in Vietnam. Here its Iraq - update complete. And the storyline? Something about stolen engraving plates and bundles of counterfeit cash but truly the plot is incomprehensible for the obvious reason that in this genre plot has become irrelevant - its just a cheap clothesline on which to hang the expensive action. Consequently the villains are opaque too. Far as I can make out the A-listers are fighting other rogue elements within the U.S. defence establishment like private contractors and ever-shady CIA types. In a politically polarized era when Americas greatest enemy is itself such internecine warfare might have been interesting - if only it were decipherable. On to the bantering comedy those programmed respites of calm between the stormy outbursts. Actually this is almost a strength. Cooper has an affable way of mugging to the camera so does Patrick Wilson as that CIA lout and Copley is a veritable vocal chameleon adroit at instantly switching accents and tossing off extemporized asides. The problem is director Joe Carnahan whos way too manic even when the formula calls for calm - he cant stay still long enough to drive home the punch-lines. Which brings us to the action - helicopters chasing bigger helicopters a full-sized tank parachuting from a massive cargo plane huge shipping containers stacked like Lego and toppling like dominoes all of it chaotic and confusing and weirdly static (yes exactly like the plot). Yet maybe just maybe the ugliness is deliberate. The conventional aesthetic says that a great action director a John Woo or a Tarantino wields the camera gracefully through the sequence to thrilling kinetic effect. The film speeds up but with a clear-eyed elegance like an elite athlete accelerating with purpose and control. But the action scenes here and in countless similar movies have exactly the opposite result Shot in jagged close-up disorienting shards they stop the film dead in its tracks. Instead of acceleration theres stasis; instead of purpose confusion; instead of thrills noise. Yet surely Carnahan and his kind cant be that incompetent. Perhaps this is just a different aesthetic where disorientation is the goal where the action flick is no longer an escape from reality but an exaggeration of it not a retreat from the fragmentation and noise of the information age but its explosive echo. If so then Coopers character is bang-on when he reiterates his strategy to foil the bad guys ""Distraction diversion division."" Measured by that standard The A-Team merits an A-plus. In which case to the old box-office maxim that trite makes right a fresh corollary must be attached Chaos is the new order and ugly the new beautiful.

What could go wrong? Plenty actually.The first hurdle director-writer Joe Carnahan working with a couple of screenwriters demonstrating why youve never heard of them fails to clear Who is he making this movie for? More to the point since we all know its the same male-teen audience that every summer action blockbuster wannabe is made for Has that audience ever watched or even heard of the original A-Team?Judging by the movies muddled treatment - simultaneously a remedial primer and series of insider references - Carnahan and company decided to answer that question with a bet-hedging ""yes and no."" The movie takes us through an extended flashback to establish how the team formed whisking us to a grubby shack in backwater Mexico where we meet Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson) and learn the guy is tough unflappable and wont shoot dogs. People hell shoot by the score but dogs? No.Then were taken through the movies back-story roll call. We meet Face (Bradley Cooper); B.A. Baracus (Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson); and Murdock (Sharlto Copley). Were 20 minutes into the movie before the history lesson is complete and its 45 minutes before we know what present-day challenge the team is going to have to resolve. Movie Information The A-TeamRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Joe CarnahanStarring Liam Neeson Bradley Cooper Jessica Biel Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson and Sharlto CopleyRun time 118 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (intense sequences of action and violence throughout language and smoking)Synopsis Explosions speed and the old gang are back this time led by Liam Neeson as Hannibal.More movies from GuideLive.comCarnahan tries to keep things moving by splashing nonstop action all over the screen. We get torture a dogfight a few gunfights a car chase and a helicopter race before the opening credits have finished. From there its on to Iraq and Saddam loyalists a CIA creep (Patrick Wilson doing a movie-long Will Arnett impression) and a plan to intercept some stolen U.S currency plates and a few billion dollars in bogus bills.The movie tries to weave in some references to reality such as a private security company called Black Forest led by a rogue mercenary who may as well sport an eye patch and a peg leg to complete his postmodern pirate performance. These touches dont work as they only create the impression that the film takes itself seriously - something the TV show never did.But the biggest problem is Carnahans hyper- adrenalized directing style. Anyone who saw Smokin Aces (or ack Smokin Aces 2 ) knows the drill - endless action sequences in which the camerawork and editing are so strobe-light frenetic that you have no idea whats going on. Its like watching something while tumbling in a dryer. The finale is a gargantuan mess of fireballs and shipment-container avalanches - maybe the dumbest five minutes ever filmed.This team may have given itself an A but viewers likely wont be so generous. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Yet the picture might almost have been designed to make the Bruckheim-meister jealous. Its arguable that he has never produced a movie thats this jam-packed with bluster and noise hurtling metal preposterous hair-breadth escapes eyeball-filling explosions snark-under-pressure one-liners and so-gung-ho-its-almost-nostalgic American ass-kickery. The movie introduces its characters with witty comic-book touches like slow-mo shots that reveal how the Mohawked B.A. Baracus (Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson) has ""Pity"" and ""Fool"" tattooed on his fists (he never actually says the words). For the next two hours The A-Team rockets forward on little bits like that. The director the cheerfully shameless and undeniably talented Joe Carnahan (Smokin Aces) works hard for the money. One of Carnahans favorite tricks is to stage an elaborate chain reaction of an action sequence the sort of thing that would have been a major piece of overkill in a movie like Con Air and treat it as just one more casual movie moment -- another sandwiched-in throwaway thrill in a film thats addicted to them. When Col. Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson) the jaunty cigar-chomping leader of the A-Team plots out an operation to recapture a collection of top-secret American-currency printing plates that have been smuggled out of Iraq the movie cross-cuts between two things his explanation of the plan complete with little models on a game board and the actual carrying out of it -- a speeding-truck chase sequence full of perfectly timed wisecracks and firepower. That overlap between planning and execution lends the sequence a breathless leaping-forward quality and thats what the whole movie has. Thats the fun of The A-Team and its limitation too. The movie is such a relentless action windup toy that its never about anything but its own high-megaton ingenuity. On TV The A-Team was like The Dirty Dozen made prime-time clean and the movie preserves that basic hero/outlaw go-USA wholesomeness but crazies it up a little. The team itself a squad of U.S. Army special-ops soldiers who are found guilty of a crime they didnt commit and carry on anyway as good-guy renegades are entirely one-dimensional characters but they still pop on screen. Liam Neeson has reinvented himself as an action star and hes a natural at it loose funny and physically imperious a middle-aged bruiser who always looks like hes enjoying himself immensely. Bradley Cooper as Face the groups hotshot and lothario has some fast funny lines (as when he impersonates a British reporter to filch a TV babes ID card) but he grins so smugly that he looks like hes just seen the grosses of The Hangover. Quinton Jackson as B.A. is stuck updating an iconic yet anachronistic character (Mr. T played him like an angry action figure) and hes a little innocuous if likably quick. Sharlto Copley the star of District 9 completes the quartet as the manic meshugana Murdock; hes like the missing unhinged Wilson brother and very amusing when he impersonates Mel Gibson in Braveheart or breaks into perfect Swahili to talk his way past a customs gate. The team tangles with a whole welter of antagonists and authority figures Patrick Wilson as a CIA stooge; Jessica Biel as a frowning Defense Department officer whos still in love with Face her former flame; the excellent Brian Bloom as a mercenary gone very very bad. The movie itself just keeps whizzing by -- its entertainment on hyperdrive. Carnahan is obsessed with action logistics dogfights and fistfights last-minute rescues by missile attack bullets fired through skyscraper windows at the exact right moment the insane image of a tank plummeting to earth while dangling from a parachute. At times it can all grow wearying but Carnahan works in a way thats much lighter than say Tony Scott. He really does see blowing stuff up as the ultimate extension of playing with toys. After all its tossed-off climaxes The A-Team finally finishes with a real climax in which piles and piles of colorful storage compartments get blown up as a ""diversionary"" activity. But whos kidding whom? The whole movie is a diversionary activity. Its trash so compacted it glows.

Thus speaks Liam Neesons squinty-eyed attractively graying Hannibal Smith in ""The A-Team"" a thoroughly unnecessary but nonetheless satisfying adaptation of the cheeseball 1980s TV series. This StoryThe A-Team Bombs and bromanceFind The A-Team showtimesWatch the trailerThe A-Team and The Karate Kid out (again) for kicksView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Smiths catchphrase has to do with the harebrained scheme Neesons Army Ranger and his ""Alpha Team"" routinely choreograph to save whatever day happens to be at hand. But it might as well apply to the movie itself a project that has clearly been engineered to exploit baby boomers nostalgia while it frantically courts the gnat-like attention spans of their grandsons. Thus ""The A-Team"" which co-stars Bradley Cooper Quinton Jackson and Sharlto Copley engages in the same blurry incoherent close-up action to which young filmgoers have now become accustomed. Plenty of stuff blows up in between wisecracks and Smiths explanations of what the audience is seeing -- exposition that is badly needed in a film this visually frenetic and breathlessly paced. During a preamble set in the Mexican desert we meet the guys the unflappable Smith who from behind a haze of cigar smoke figures all the angles and inspires doe-like admiration in his men; Face the blue-eyed ladies man played by Cooper whose chief job in the gang seems to be seducing women and assuming an ever-more-cocky air of bluff bravado; Murdock (Copley) the crazy-like-a-fox pilot who flies the dudes to safety in whatever whirlybird is parked nearby; and Bosco ""B.A."" Baracus the Mohawked muscleman. Of course Bosco was played by Mr. T in the series and here Jackson pays homage to the original by dotting his dialogue with ""fool"" every few words or so. But in ""The A-Teams"" third act (or at least its first third act) he undergoes a conversion that promises to add surprising new depth to a character who became a caricature somewhere between Alf and Urkel as one of the 80s most enduring icons. Luckily for fans who come to ""The A-Team"" for preposterously ballistic escapism B.A. eventually reverts to form and the movie duly proceeds to ever-more-risible lengths to up the action ante. In case watching a guy machine-gun his enemies from atop a tank floating through the sky on parachutes isnt enough the filmmakers treat viewers to an elaborately staged climax at the Los Angeles piers where stacks of shipping containers are thrown around like so many toy blocks. Almost as an afterthought Jessica Biel appears as one of Faces erstwhile love interests. But much more screen time is given to Patrick Wilson as a slippery CIA agent in league with an equally nefarious private contractor (""Assassins in polo shirts"" Smith calls the mercenaries who are clearly based on the boys of Blackwater). Between the electric baby-blues of Cooper and Wilson the frequent sight of the men worshipfully assessing one anothers Ranger tattoos and a final-act cameo from a male heartthrob who seems to be engaging Cooper in a handsome-off ""The A-Team"" might be selling itself as an action flick but in its heart of hearts its just a hopeless bromantic.  PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense sequences of action and violence throughout profanity and smoking. 117 minutes. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Bombs and bromance Find The A-Team showtimes The A-Team and The Karate Kid out (again) for kicks Watch the trailer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/10/AR2010061001617.html,200,thea-team11,thea-team,washingtonpost

It couldnt have been easy making a movie with less plot character development and dramatic credibility than an episode of a campy 80s TV series. This feat is somehow managed by Joe Carnahans overlong overblown and utterly forgettable big-screen reboot of ""The A-Team."" The cartoonish hugely popular series -- about a quartet of special services misfits who turn soldiers of fortune after being framed for a crime they didnt commit -- is primarily beloved as a vehicle for the inimitable Mr. T who found the role of a lifetime as the muscular driver B.A. Baracus. Pity his poor successor lightweight martial-arts champ (turned lightweight actor) Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson who goes out of his way not to imitate his predecessor though his knuckles are equipped with tattoos spelling out ""Pity"" and ""Fool"" -- from Mr. Ts catchphrase from his other major role in ""Rocky III."" Dominating the film instead is the newly minted star of ""The Hangover"" Bradley Cooper who lets his abs do most of the acting as the exquisitely tanned procurement expert (women and weapons) Templeton ""Face"" Peck. POPWRAP CHATS WITH STAR SHARLTO COPLEY PHOTOS BIG-SCREEN REMAKES George Peppards old role of team leader Hannibal Smith has been taken by Oscar nominee Liam Neeson whose recent run of paycheck jobs is beginning to resemble Laurence Oliviers late period. Apparently they didnt pay Neeson enough to get his perfectly serviceable American accent; theres more than a hint of a brogue when this American military veteran delivers the odd line of exposition between puffs on a cigar. Under the circumstances the film is stolen -- petty larceny really -- by South African actor Sharlto Copley (""District 9""). Hes a hoot in the showy (if underwritten) role of H.M. ""Howling Mad"" Murdock a certified (and certifiable) pilot who the guys bust out of a military nuthouse where hes been incarcerated since the first Gulf War. Its clear from the 20-minute credits sequence set in Mexico that this ""A-Team"" is less interested in any kind of coherent storytelling than a collection of elaborately ridiculous stunts featuring the stars and their doubles. The plot which wends its way from Iraq to the United States to Germany and back to the US (and was very impressively filmed entirely in British Columbia) has something to do with the guys trying to clear their names and recover printing plates for counterfeit 100 bills. All the time they are being pursued by a military police officer (Jessica Biel) who is Faces former lover; a CIA operative (Patrick Wilson) who may have framed them; and a creepy private military contractor played by Brian Bloom also credited with the minimalist screenplay (which practically borders on the avant-garde) along with Skip Woods (""Swordfish"") and director Carnahan (""Smokin Aces""). As I said its all the merest of pretexts for a series of stunts -- like the team firing on aircraft from a tank attached to a parachute. Its something that works better in the trailer than in the context of the movie which allows you far too much time to contemplate whether such a thing is actually possible. As ""The A-Team"" mindlessly stretches toward the two-hour mark theres ample opportunity to wonder about a lot of things including the frightening possibility of a 3-D sequel. One thing is for sure Mr. T was no fool to turn down a cameo. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Green Lantern 2 and Flash movies get the go-ahead Read Next Green Lantern 2 and Flash movies get the go-ahead Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46924 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 19318 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18679 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"The A-Team movie review Revisiting TVs A-Team without a plan |       NJ.com comments The A-Team movie review Revisiting TVs A-Team without a plan Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 11 2010 at 1234 AM View/Post Comments Doug Curran/20th Century FoxFace (Bradley Cooper) B.A. (Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson) Murdock (Sharlto Copley) Hannibal (Liam Neeson) and race into action in Joe Carnahans big-budget remake of the 1980s TV series ""The A-Team.""Quick what do you remember about ""The A-Team""? Its not a rhetorical question. Really quick please what do you remember about the 1980s TV series? Because all I can come up with is a sort of ""Dirty Dozen"" gimmick George Peppard with a cigar loud explosions and Mr. T. But thats okay. The folks behind this big-budget big-screen remake didnt remember much more than that either. The A-Team (PG-13) Fox (117 min.) Directed by Joe Carnahan. With Liam Neeson Bradley Cooper Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Two stars Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. So weve got the silvery-haired stogie-loving ringleader again -- this time played by the way-too-busy Liam Neeson. And Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson as a stand-in for the original Mohawked menace. And yeah some outside-the-law good guys and lots of stuff blowing up. And I pity the fool looking for anything more. Unfortunately you do sort of need something more here. And the picture doesnt deliver it. Director Joe Carnahan -- whose nothing-succeeds-like-excess filmography includes the awful ""Smokin Aces"" -- cuts his action sequences together so fast and furiously you cant see whats actually happening. Nor can you hear anyones explanations as his sole direction to the actors seems to have been ""Louder And faster And all at once"" But if you think thats tiresome wait for the interludes when Carnahan tries to convince us -- or at least himself -- that this is actually a real movie with real characters. Jessica Biel and Bradley Cooper discuss their commitment issues. Neeson and Jackson debate -- no Im not kidding -- Gandhis theories on nonviolence. And you thought this was about outside-the-law good guys and lots of stuff blowing up? Well it is and the film regularly gets back to all that. But its own confusion about what it really is -- an honestly mindless guilty pleasure or an actually smart caper movie -- keeps it from succeeding at either. Besides its neither honest about its mindlessness nor smart about its capers. The big casts prettier members includes Cooper who strides through the movie grinning as if hes just realized hes a movie star and Biel who shows her regular-Army determination by occasionally remembering to button up her blouse. Both actors deserve better. The character of the A-Teams crazy cowboy pilot meanwhile deserved to be played by Owen Wilson and not Sharlto Copley the South African star of ""District 9"" whos unrecognizable here. And also mostly insufferable. But then too much of this is. ""I believe no matter how random things may appear theres still a plan"" Neeson declares at one point. Hes right about the randomness so heres your plan Rent ""The Losers"" if you want a cheesy action movie. Wait for ""The Expendables"" if you want a gritty pumped-up one. And mark this ""A-Team"" strictly C-grade.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The A-Team Action. Starring Liam Neeson Bradley Cooper and Jessica Biel. Directed by Joe Carnahan. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The characters in ""The A-Team"" are in possession of esoteric knowledge They know whats going on in the movie. To each other they talk about various people and situations and we just sit patiently accepting that they know what theyre doing that it will all work out for the best. Kind of like watching a Latin Mass. Yet somehow this is OK. ""The A-Team"" is a Joe Carnahan movie i.e. an experiment in propulsion and personality over substance and story. Carnahan directs as if his audience were made up of creatures without thought or memory who can be distracted only by flashing images and wisecracks. The characters he places onscreen are without interest. Their problems are not our problems. But the sheer motion the spectacle and the flashes of wit take ""The A-Team"" out of the realm of garbage. Its fun. The movie is based on the TV show of the same name which was considered lowbrow in the 1980s. But that was before the collapse of Western civilization so the filmmakers had their work cut out for them. Carnahan and co-screenwriters Brian Bloom and Skip Woods introduce the main characters over the course of a long and entertaining credits sequence in which Hannibal (Liam Neeson) is about to be devoured by dogs and Face (Bradley Cooper) is about to be burned alive.

""Howling Mad"" Murdock UFC light heavyweight Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson as B.A. Baracas and Liam Neeson as Col Hannibal Smith star in ... more Photo Handout MCT Review The A-Team 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Face apparently had sex with his tormenters wife and before the angry husband lights the match he asks why. ""Well shes so hot and we both hate you so ..."" The attitude is offensive but the logic unassailable. The movie also introduces Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson as Baracus the role made famous by Mr. T. Actually Mr. T was so distinct even for those of us who werent fans of the show that to see Jackson here is to think ""Who is this nice guy going around in a Mr. T costume?"" The script gives Jackson plenty of opportunities to say ""I pity the fool"" but he just doesnt have the anger - or the comedy. Theres something missing there. After the credits things settle down for about a minute or two to give the audience not quite a story but a pretext for the ensuing action Some Arabs are in possession of authentic 100 plates and will soon be printing billions and billions of dollars in counterfeit currency which will result in ... oh I dunno the collapse of the world economic system the end of life as we know it take your pick. Basically the only thing between us and disaster is the morons in this movie. They have to get the plates Get the plates This becomes the movies mantra. Along the way we meet Jessica Biel as a Defense Department agent who used to be in love with Face but now she hates him. Biel needs careful handling as an actress and Carnahan is not the one to give it to her. And so with this film she assumes the crown once held by Jessica Alba as the movie star with the most profound inverse relationship between her good looks and her acting ability. Neeson and Cooper pick up the slack with Cooper especially showing a comic insouciance that we havent seen before. The action sequences are imaginative and on a grand scale and every so often someone gets off a good line. It would probably be for the best if Carnahan might drink one less Red Bull before showing up on the set or in the editing room. But by the end of ""The A-Team"" theres the sense of having had a full movie meal - most of it empty calories but with lots of opportunities for seconds and thirds. -- Advisory This film contains lots of violence.

"A-Team Three stars for 80s TV show remake | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesA-Team Three stars for 80s TV show remakeJoe Carnahans big-screen adaptation of the hit 80s TV action series is A-O.K.The A-Team puts a new twist on the 80s TV drama but stays true to its over-the-top roots.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 10 2010The A-Team (out of 4)Starring Liam Neeson Bradley Cooper Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson Sharlto Copley Jessica Biel and Patrick Wilson. Directed by Joe Carnahan. 157 minutes. At major theatres. PGThere are plenty of reasons to smile at The A-Team Joe Carnahans pump-you-up screen adaptation of the 1980s TV action series. But the best has to be Liam Neesons angry put-down of a thuggish rival.""Hes a cartoon character"" sneers Neesons Col. Hannibal Smith.Article Continued BelowPot meet kettle.Having one two-dimensional figure insult another for lack of realism is like G.I. Joe calling Buzz Lightyear plastic.Acting like a cartoon is the whole point of The A-Team and also the main appeal of this dumb summer fun which is actually smarter than it needs to be. In this case gratefully ""dumb"" isnt a synonym for ""idiotic.""Carnahan stylistically rides the line between the near-parody of his Vegas mash-up Smokin Aces and the bleak realism of his police drama Narc. In so doing he follows Smiths dictum about always having a plan.He remains true to A-Team lore a quartet of ex-military aces benevolent brutes all band together to right wrongs and settle scores anywhere in the world shedding only the blood permitted by the U.S. PG-13 rating. But the film adds a few new touches -- a shift to the Middle East from Vietnam an all-too-believable army-vs.-CIA subplot and a truly menacing villain -- that keep things on the boil.Neeson takes last years Taken to its logical next level by marching into George Peppards old role of Smith a cigar-chomping square jaw with fatherly mien and boyish enthusiasm. Smith says ""plan"" so often you could make a drinking game out of it once the film hits DVD.Bradley Cooper nimbly assumes the pose and pecs of Dirk Benedicts Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck a pretty-boy powerhouse whose multilingual verbal skills are as smooth in the bedroom as they are in the field.Mixed martial arts champ Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson has the difficult task of assuming the iconic ""pity the fool"" image of Mr. T from the TV series the most cartoonish A-Teamer of all. But Jacksons B.A. Baracus makes for an agreeable facsimile even if it is tough to figure out what hes saying at times. Usually its some variation of ""thats B.S."" because he leaves ""pity"" and ""fool"" to the back of his hands.Which leaves surprise pick Sharlto Copley the civil service dweeb from District 9. He nuts up nicely as the replacement for Dwight Schultzs ""Howling Mad"" Murdock a psycho ward inmate who also makes for one hell of a helicopter pilot.You dont expect much of a plot in a movie like this -- recent copycat The Losers certainly didnt trouble itself with one. But Carnahan and his vast crew of co-writers (as many as 11 in all according to Hollywood blogger Nikki Finke) miraculously managed to put together something resembling a decent yarn.They go old school with a story about bad guys conveniently located in Baghdad who just want to use money -- not bombs or bugs -- to cause social unrest. Theyve stolen U.S. Mint engraving plates so they can print billions worth of 100 bills to flood the American economy (too bad the government already beat them to that scam).The A-Teamers try to do right but instead get accused of doing wrong. The four are sent to separate maximum security prisons that no man can break out of (insert hysterical laughter here).Even as the movie devolves into your standard shootout where the laws of physics and gravity are violated more than manmade ones it remains loyal to its characters including three well-cast troublemakers.A game Jessica Biel is Army Capt. Sosa a by-the-book babe who has a history with Face (hes still smiling she isnt) and no patience for the A-Teams shenanigans. She can strut while wearing high heels.Patrick Wilson is CIA Agent Lynch a petulant technocrat who may actually be smarter than he seems. Or maybe not.Brian Bloom is Pike leader of a black ops group Smith derisively calls not just cartoons but also ""assassins in Polo shirts.""Pike gives the picture a genuine sense of menace something it would otherwise be lacking in a story that uses airbags toy dolls and a Steely Dan tune amongst its many improvised weapons of mass distraction.The A-Team even manages to include a hilarious send-up of 3-D mania (the movie is 2-D only which is all it needs) plus a shout out to TVs Mad Men that should have fans of that series nodding in admiration.""Overkill is underrated"" Smith says. And once again hes hammered the square peg straight into the round hole.I pity the fool who fails to share the popcorn.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

A classic yes but nothing like the clumsy dehumanized spectacles that have come to dominate the multiplexes during the summer months. Debra Graniks drama a big winner at this years Sundance Film Festival is spectacular for its humanity austere beauty and heart-stopping urgency. The setting is the Ozark mountains of southwestern Missouri at the present time though many of the faces might have been photographed by Dorothea Lange or for that matter Matthew Brady and the themes are timeless--love kinship the struggle to survive. The 17-year-old heroine Ree Dolly is played by Jennifer Lawrence a professional actress who doesnt seem to act so much as achieve a state of grace that combines intelligence with fierce resolve. And ferocity is required of Ree since she is the only one who can keep disaster from her familys door. ENLARGE Ashlee Thompson Jennifer Lawrence and Isaiah Stone in Winters Bone. Roadside Attractions Her task is to find Jessup Dolly her crank-cooking no-account fugitive of a father. If she fails as seems likely the marshals will evict her her young brother and sister and their blank-faced mother from the cabin that Jessup put up for bond at his trial before vanishing without a trace. The plot is plainly old-fashioned though no more anachronistic than Rees rural hardscrabble surroundings. Michael McDonoughs searching camera reminds us that we Americans live along many different time streams. On this one which flows directly from the Great Depression poverty remains so entrenched that the local small-business model is a meth lab and two prospects for postgraduate life are reflected in afternoon programs at Rees high school parenting classes and ROTC drills. Until now Ive made ""Winters Bone"" sound more like an object of admiration than the source of deep pleasure that it is but only because I dont want to soften its sharp edges. The director who worked with Anne Rosellini on adapting Daniel Woodrells novel has explored the Ozark culture without condescension or sentimentality. Her film is populated by explosive often brutal men with guns and their submissive often frightened women. Pride prevents Ree from asking for desperately needed food. (""Never ask for what ought to be offered"" she tells her little brother.) Her neighbors code of silence smothers her inquiries. (""Talking just causes witnesses"" a steely-eyed harridan tells her.) Kindness is in short supply and her quest grows ever more lonely as she penetrates the heart of her fathers personal darkness. So where does the pleasure come in? At just about every moment Ree is on screen. When shes teaching her brother and sister to shoot squirrels for food. (""You guys want these fried or stewed?"") When she confides however cautiously in an Army recruiter. (In a film thats full of surprises the recruiter is one of many minor characters who merit attention.) When she finds the courage to speak her mind. (""You have always scared me"" she tells her uncle Teardrop who is played with hair-trigger brilliance by John Hawkes. ""Thats cause youre smart"" he replies.) She is very smart as well as fearless up to a point though fearfully vulnerable. Ree is a thrilling heroine so old-fashioned that shes new and Ms. Lawrence gives her the sort of rock-solid yet poetic quality that recalls ""The Grapes of Wrath"" or the neo-realist films from Europe following World War II. The filmmaker Ms. Granik dealt with the grim realities of drug addiction in her debut feature ""Down to the Bone."" (What to make of all dem bones?) Her new film far from being a downer makes its way through harshness and hardship into hope. The Karate Kid ""Its like were brave pioneers on a quest to start a magical life in a new land"" the kids mother announces overbrightly in ""The Karate Kid"" just before they leave Detroit for Beijing. ""You could say that"" her son mutters with corrective cool. You could also say its like theyre likable tourists on a quest to plunder an endearing movie that didnt need this mediocre remake. The kid no longer Daniel but Dre is played by Jaden Smith the touchingly tender delicate-featured son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. (His mom is played by Teraji P. Henson.) The boy looks much younger than his 12 years; hes in a league of his own--a little league--compared to Ralph Macchio who was in his early 20s when he played the kid as a sturdy teenager. Size matters here. Its appalling to watch Dre being battered bruised and borderline-brutalized by Chinese counterparts of the original toughs (who this time practice a World Wrestling Entertainment variant of kung fu rather than a Rocky version of karate). The pall doesnt cover the rest of the movie. Jaden is endearing in his own way and the abstract notion of Jackie Chan in Pat Moritas role of the wise mentor almost obscures the reality of Mr. Chans zonked performance which simulates warm feelings toward the kid without risk of infectiousness. ENLARGE Bradley Cooper and Liam Neeson in The A-Team. Twentieth Century Fox The A-Team Liam Neesons Hannibal the bemuscled but seldom bemused master planner of ""The A-Team"" keeps insisting on his belief in an invisible order ""No matter how random things may appear theres a plan in everything."" Hes obviously right. In the absence of a coherent script (or in the presence of a script that like quantum mechanics puts a premium on randomness) the plan for this big-screen version of the cheerful old TV series could hardly be clearer--lay down an almost ceaseless barrage of thunderous action turn up the sensory heat for summer audiences whove taken refuge in the multiplex cold. Watch a scene from ""The A-Team"" starring Liam Neeson as Hannibal Bradley Cooper as Face Sharto Copley as Murdock and Quinton Rampage Jackson as B.A. Baracus. Video courtesy 20th Century Fox. Mr. Neeson gives the movie as much gravitas as he can without provoking giggles. Of the actors playing the other members of the team the only one with a world-class performance in his resume is Sharlto Copley the star of ""District 9."" He plays Murdock the crackpot pilot and gets to do barrel-rolls in a C-130 transport but thats about it. If youre looking for logic or finesse ""The A-Team"" can be numbing. If youre looking for good cheer hold out for egg nog at Christmas. But if youre a fan of causeless effects consequence-free causes and digital Dada let the silly times roll. Joan Rivers A Piece of Work Who would have guessed that ""Joan Rivers A Piece of Work"" would turn out to be a stirring portrait of indomitability? I thought I knew as much as I needed to know about an entertainer whos been on stage for four decades and resisted seeing this fine documentary by Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg. Yet here the filmmakers find her at the age of 75 a foulmouthed Mrs. Sisyphus pushing ever onward and occasionally upward in a world transfixed by youth and beauty. Once she was wild for the times. Her closing line she recalls used to be ""Im Joan Rivers and I put out."" Now she holds out with defiant energy and an almost maniacal focus against the encroachments of old age personal loss and dwindling bookings. (Which suddenly undwindled with a vengeance when she prevailed in of all potentially demeaning things ""Celebrity Apprentice."") Demeaning doesnt belong in her vocabulary. She could not be more candid about her willingness to accept any work that pays. Part of that is fueled by economics; shes determined to remain in the lap of luxury which includes a New York apartment that in her words ""is how Marie Antoinette would have lived if shed had money."" (I also thought I wouldnt be laughing at her jokes many of which turn out to be fresh and terrific.) But mostly shes a creature of implacable incurable and endlessly nourishing anger--at NBC and Johnny Carson who befriended and then she says betrayed her when she produced an ill-fated talk show of her own on Fox; at critics who wont give her what she wants the most validation as an actress; at the march of time and its ominous drumbeat. Sometimes her laughs are mirthless and you wonder what shes thinking. What she thinks of herself though seems perfectly if improbably reasonable--a queen of comedy who wont and shouldnt abdicate. Gangsters Paradise In South Africa where ""Gangsters Paradise"" was made the film was originally called ""Jerusalema""--a violent hymn heavy with irony to the new Jerusalem that was promised but not delivered by the nations postapartheid governments. Theres nothing heavy however about Ralph Zimans nimble and electrifying chronicle of Lucky Kunene an ardent good-hearted kid growing up to be a charismatic community organizer and then a gang boss. Lucky whos played with huge elan by Rapula Seiphemo takes inspiration where he can find it from sages as diverse as Karl Marx Al Capone and Donald Trump and from fragrant phrases like affirmative repossession a local euphemism for carjacking. The movie repossesses just as affirmatively a host of Hollywood conventions from such films as ""Scarface"" ""The Godfather"" and ""Heat."" Yet the results are startlingly original if occasionally overambitious. This is ""Tsotsi"" without the feel-good glow a tale of entrepreneurships perils and boundless pleasures.

(FoxFilms/HO) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 10 2010 1155 AM Title The A-Team Joe Carnahans big-screen remake of ""The A-Team"" begins with a punch to the head an almost quaint introduction for a movie otherwise built on bullets bombs chases and crashes (via car tank plane and helicopter).In other words if you just want to shut your brain off Carnahans happy to flip the switch.Those with fond memories of the television show -- which ran from 1983-1987 -- will feel a rush of nostalgia as four familiar names appear on screen. Their faces however have changed.Team leader Hannibal Smith a role originated by George Peppard is played by Liam Neeson while Ultimate Fighting champion Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson steps in for Mr. T as B.A. Baracus. Bradley Cooper now plays conman Face and Sharlto Copley is crazy Murdock.In the series the four were unfairly disgraced Vietnam vets who used their skills to help others. Here theyre sent home from Iraq and focused on clearing their own names. After a covert mission to recover stolen currency plates goes awry theyre hunted by a slick CIA agent (Patrick Wilson) and a furious Lieutenant (Jessica Biel). Unless they prove they were set up they face a lifetime in maximum security.But plot appears to be about tenth on Carnahans list of priorities. First he had to worry about special effects stuntmen weapons explosives fight choreography and an unusually large parachute budget. True to the decade that inspired this movie nothings too big too bold too shameless. (Gandhi is solemnly invoked . . . to encourage violence.)There is no arguing that the movie is absurdly overlong and ridiculously underdeveloped. But though Mr. T. shouldnt feel threatened all the leads do seem to be having fun.The wisecracks are just goofy enough to remain endearing (aside from a few decidedly old-fashioned sexist insults). And most important for an unforgettable summer action flick Carnahan knows how to stage mayhem equally well on land and in the air.Both in name and spirit ""The A-Team"" drags the Eighties into the 21st century and you might be surprised to find -- if only briefly -- that youve missed them just a little.

"Movie review The A-Team - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMovie review The A-TeamThere is no why in Team an overly long complex and loud action film based on the hit 1980s TV show.June 11 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic It may be true as ""The A-Teams"" Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith insists that ""overkill is underrated"" but you wouldnt know it from this film. Overly long over-complicated and overflowing with what sounds like billions of bullets and beaucoup broken glass this film version of the hit 1980s TV series about soldiers of fortune is an underwhelming experience. I pity the fool as TV star Mr. T might say who mistakes this for genuine entertainment. That may sound unduly harsh especially for a movie that was never intended as an Oscar contender. After all didnt director Joe Carnahan practically dare anyone to raise any objections by saying ""If you dont like a tank flying out of a plane then you just dont like summer movies."" ""The A-Team"" does appear to have designs on being a more interesting film than the one that appears on the screen. The director and his screenwriting partner Brian Bloom (who share writing credit with Skip Woods) have talked in interviews about the character work that went into the films quartet of team members but it was to no avail. Known to all who remember the series these characters aside from Liam Neesons team leader Smith include suave lothario Templeton ""Face"" Peck ( Bradley Cooper) crazy-like-a-fox pilot H.M. ""Howlin Mad"" Murdock (Sharlto Copley) and B.A. (for Bad Attitude) Baracus (Quinto Jackson a.k.a. Rampage) the Mohawk-wearing muscle of the group. Although attempts are made to flesh out these individuals they do not succeed in making them involving. In fact the more we see of this quartet the less we like them an excess of hearty camaraderie comes off not as good fellowship but smug self-satisfaction. And some of the characters especially Howlin Mad are conceived in a way that is perpetually off-putting. Carnahan obviously was not hired for this project because of a facility for psychological nuance but because after adrenalized films like ""Smokin Aces"" and ""Narc"" he is one of Hollywoods go-to guys for brisk peppy action and he delivers. Up to a point. For while the mayhem in ""The A-Team"" is effective in isolated chunks it exists in a vacuum. Watching it feels like watching an extended trailer for the film rather than the film itself an NFL highlights reel of cascading cars exotic explosions and can-you-top-this craziness that wears you out with its unfocused energy. Its not only the off-putting characterization that is the culprit here its also a ""Mission Impossible""-style plot that has so many segments twists and double and triple crosses that following it is more of a chore than an adventure. The story begins in a sequence intercut with the opening credits ""somewhere in Mexico"" where bad guys are doing their worst in the hot desert sun. Before the credits are over the four A-Team members linked by upper arm tattoos that reveal a passion for the Army Rangers have met via a series of improbable coincidences and discovered the virtues of working together. The film then jumps ""eight years and 80 successful missions later"" with the A-Team seemingly secure in its reputation as ""the best clandestine unit in the Army."" Its next assignment set during the Iraq invasion involves going into Baghdad and getting its hands on a billion dollars in counterfeit U.S. currency and the printing plates used to manufacture it. As it turns out the team has more than mere operation logistics to deal with. Intragovernmental rivalries become apparent as a CIA operative named Lynch (Patrick Wilson) and Charisa Sosa ( Jessica Biel) a captain in the Defense Criminal Investigation Service (and an ex-flame of Faces) face off. Then theres Pike (screenwriter Bloom) a private military operative who heads a group the A-Team dismissively considers ""assassins in polo shirts."" This may sound like a lot but its only a fraction of the plot which goes on and on and on and even leaves room for half-baked homilies like ""stuff like loyalty doesnt fit in overhead bins."" These may not be words to live by but theyre the best this undernourished A-Team can come up with. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTony award-winning actress TV starOctober 17 2008A theater to call their ownApril 1 2007MORE STORIES ABOUTFilmCreditsBad AttitudeCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-a-team-20100611,0,2935321.story",200,thea-team20,thea-team,latimes

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Excuse me I need to sit down catch my breath and extinguish my singed eyebrows. Ive just experienced ""The A-Team"" a highly combustible concoction of testosterone napalm and gunpowder seasoned with cheesy comedy and served flambe. In what feels like a tryout for the next ""Mission Impossible"" directing job Joe Carnahan has made the reboot of the 1980s TV series an excuse to blow up every vehicle prop and backdrop in a four-mile radius. Maybe he should consider asking his doctor if Ritalin is right for him. I could use a little myself right now. For those of you who dont remember the show -- no problem. The leading characters four Army Rangers turned soldiers of fortune are swiftly introduced and click into place as smoothly as Lego pieces. In command is Col. Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson) who likes Cuban cigars and plans especially when they come together. His partners-in-havoc include B.A. Baracus (Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson) a rip-snortin brawler who is terrified of flying. Howling Mad Murdoch (Sharlto Copley) is the teams pilot who often seems to be several landing gears short of a set. And Face (Bradley Cooper) is a prime hunk of T-bone irresistible to women. That includes Army Capt. Sosa (a perfunctory Jessica Biel) assigned to capture the men who are for reasons that hardly matter on the run. (All right they were framed for the disappearance of a counterfeiting mint in Iraq. Are you happy now?) The lead actors range from OK (Jackson has a scary physicality but needs to take the marbles out of his mouth) to great. Copley the breakout star of last years sci-fi gem ""District 9"" plays the nutty pilot with a collection of ""Rain Man"" tics that make us wonder if hes pretend-nuts or truly loco; his impromptu ""Braveheart"" speech is a thing of downright Shakespearean nuttiness. Coopers narcissistic cocktail of charm and snark isnt as intoxicating as Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark but he is buffed to frequently displayed perfection. And while its a shame to see a committed actor like Neeson doing a Bruce Willis-style toss-off role why shouldnt he enrich his golden years with easy parts and easier paychecks? The film roars into action in the pre-credits prelude and rarely downshifts. It could just as easily have been called ""High Concept Action Film 753"" so randomly are the set pieces churned out. Carnahan knows that if he throws thundering fists slashing weapons and retina-searing explosions faster than our brains can download all the visual information we wont quibble over issues of fidelity to the source material. The main benefit of basing ""The A-Team"" on a pre-existing series is that it comes partially assembled with the character quirks already in place. That way we can get to the detonations faster. THE A-TEAM  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence throughout language and smoking. In English and subtitled Spanish. And compelling cataclysms they are. One scene puts the good guys a mile in the air in a parachute drop-off tank battling attack drones with the turret gun. Another has the heroes and a couple of villains rappeling sliding and free-falling down the slopes of two ice-blue German skyscrapers amid a hail of artillery fire. Its all presented in the spirit of boys having fun. ""Overkill is underrated"" Neeson says as he prepares for a faceoff in which his men will shoot fireworks-store Roman candles at their adversaries. The villains of the piece are snide young punks representing the CIA and a private military company whom Neeson dismisses as ""assassins in polo shirts."" As with ""Iron Man 2"" and ""Robin Hood"" the film suffers from villain overload. Patrick Wilson plays Lynch a smirking twerp from Langley but the real menace oozes from Brian Bloom as his gun-for-hire subcontractor Pike the smuggest most overbearing triggerman in film history. In every scene he is the most interesting person onscreen. Carnahan and his merry crew tiptoe the tightrope of campy nostalgia but never quite slip into travesty. The teams old van makes a dramatic entrance and a comic exit; no one says ""I pity the fool"" a couple of the TV series stars pop up in brief cameos as does a contemporary TV icon. All in all its satisfying B-movie nonsense. I have to admit the plan came together.

A-Team accomplishes itThe commandos recast from the 1980s TV series are (from left) Bradley Cooper Sharlto Copley Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson and Liam Neeson.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted June 11 2010Overkill is underrated"" harrumphs stogie-smackin Col. Hannibal Smith during one of the endless lets-blow-stuff-up moments in The A-Team. And while thats certainly the philosophy Hannibal and his trio of ex-Army Ranger cowboys espouse this long loud adaptation of the 80s TV series belies the motto.Overkill in fact is overrated. By the time The A-Team careens and crashes around the world (Baghdad Mannheim Sonora) to end with a slam-bang send-off in the dockyards of Los Angeles the movie - slickly directed by Smokin Aces maestro Joe Carnahan - feels like the cinematic equivalent of the BP disaster in the gulf Its a big-screen oil spill a needless gushing of macho bluster and wild set pieces and a waste of millions and millions of dollars.Liam Neeson whose action-hero cred solidified with the 2008 sleeper Taken plays Hannibal with not altogether convincing bravado. Alternately grinning and grimacing he and his guys (Bradley Cooper is Face Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson is B.A. District 9s Sharlto Copley is the nut ball Murdock) fly helicopters upside-down drop from the sky in an armored tank hijack convoys and break out of federal pens.And about those prison escapes The A-Teamers (the A is for alpha) have been set up maybe by the CIA and theyre out to clear their names. Its the same premise that got this springs The Losers going - only The A-Team has more money to burn.Stephen J. Cannell nostalgists no doubt will appreciate the knowing salutes to the once-ubiquitous producers original show The black and beloved GMC van makes a (short-lived) appearance and while B.A. Baracus - the Mohawked muscle of the group played by Mr. T back in the day - never growls ""I pity the fool"" Jacksons knuckles are tattooed with PITY and FOOL.GeniusJessica Biel radiating military hotness shows up in uniform and out - shes an Army intel officer - spouting Shakespearean lines like ""It looks like theyre heading for the tarmac"" as she and her crew chase Hannibal and company. (Her Capt. Sosa and Coopers Face had a thing going for a while so theres putative frisson too - and a discussion about who kept the Steely Dan CD.)And in case we didnt get the point during the nearly 25-minute opening-credits prologue Sosa has this to opine about Team A ""Theyre the best clandestine unit in the four branches. And they specialize in the ridiculous.""The A-Team is really no better or worse than a whole bunch of other steroid studio-built extravaganzas but the cumulative effect of these stunts-aplenty window-crashing-fireball-exploding-freeway-chasing-rocket-launching shoot-outs is numbing.By the time The A-Teams fourth (or fifth?) extravagantly plotted and outrageously executed rescue mission or escape mission or MacGuffin-nabbing mission is done with its just about impossible to care.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Frenzied over-the-top A-Team gives B-movies a bad name - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Frenzied over-the-top A-Team gives B-movies a bad name Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Doug Curran 20th Century Fox New Hannibal and B.A. Liam Neeson and Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe A-Team  1/2 (out of four) Stars Liam Neeson Bradley Cooper Sharlto Copley Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson Jessica Biel Patrick WilsonDirector Joe CarnahanDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence throughout language and smokingRunning time 1 hour 58 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY As the leader of the A-Team Liam Neeson boldly asserts ""Overkill is underrated."" Though its a clever line its hardly a viable mantra for a coherent action flick -- even one based on a shlocky 80s TV show. Director Joe Carnahan ascribes to the wrongheaded notion that frantic equals exciting. But theres nothing exciting about this awful over-the-top reboot. There is however plenty of frenetic action of the sort thats delivered so speedily that instead of quickening our pulses it makes our eyes glaze. TRAILER Preview The A-Team MORE A-Team stars dial down the camp Despite a talented cast this nearly two-hour inane frenzy of action and violence is rarely more than bloated and boring. The A-Team 2.0 consist of Bradley Cooper as the womanizing Templeton ""Face"" Peck District 9s Sharlto Copley as the borderline insane ""Howlin Mad"" Murdock and Quinton ""Rampage"" Johnson as the nimble fighter B.A. Baracus made famous by Mr. T. The three are led by Neeson who plays Hannibal Smith. Why Neeson has decided to reinvent himself as an action hero is mystifying. But then its also bewildering why a studio chose to remake this forgettable TV show. The team is supposedly an ultra-courageous elite military squad who carries out inventive and daring escapades. Their antics also are played for silly comic effect. But neither the comedy nor the stunts and effects make for much fun. Baracus is a fierce fighter but hes a remarkable baby when it comes to flying. Hes alternately drugged and enticed with food to get him on board a helicopter flown by the nutso Murdock. This is Carnahan and companys idea of humor. The film opens abruptly when the quartet -- Iraq War vets this time around -- takes a top-secret assignment which results in their being framed. Theyre all thrown into prison hellbent on proving their innocence. An unconvincing romance between Coopers Face and Jessica Biels Capt. Sosa is shoehorned in. The much-used technique of cutting back and forth among characters devising and executing elaborate plans wears thin. There is one outlandish scene where the team flies a tank through the air. Never mind credibility -- at least its an original visual effect in a movie that is thoroughly derivative. Subverting a quote from Gandhi to justify violence may be stretching the notion of originality. But if the rest of the movie had been cheeky enough that would have been a much funnier line. Instead we get wooden acting and over-the-top action. Its hard not to pity the fools who spend their dollars on this overblown mess.

But Im sure hed answer to Pecs Teeth or Fake Tan. Cooper spends a lot of the movie promoting the upside of a personal trainer and good dental work. Hes not completely interesting enough to be the upside of this remake of the mid-1980s TV show.Like Chris Evans Gerard Butler and Ashton Kutcher Cooper doesnt take himself seriously enough for us to. He slides along the surface of his movies. Here he gets to flash his enormous grin while shooting from a tank as it plummets from the sky. Thats a stupid scene and while tis the season for such nonsense the excitement its meant to pass on to us is lost in a spree of terrible editing and a plot that not even your being the screenwriter could make you care about.Face Hannibal (Liam Neeson) B.A. (Quinton ""Rampage Jackson) and Murdock (Sharlto Copley) are Army Rangers caught up in a scheme to recover engraving plates for US money. Theyre wrongly imprisoned but escape in a matter of scenes. Between tearing up a lot of German property and scores of shipping containers in the Port of Los Angeles they attempt to exonerate themselves.Jessica Biel is on hand as Faces ex and an agent in pursuit of his crew. Shes convincing only when taking a mental swim in Coopers oceanic eyes. This is a movie that could have gotten away with making only a little bit of sense had it more superpowers or superstars. Neeson doesnt quite count since hes made the mistake of giving a performance. His speech about Gandhi made me well up for all the wrong reasons. The movies other roles are filled out by anonymous-looking men in suits and uniforms one of whom is played by Patrick Wilson. Coopers participation obviates his. Having both men in one movie is a dreamy redundancy.The director Joe Carnahan -- ""Narc ""Smokin Aces -- coasts on expensive-looking sloppily executed action sequences that fall well short of standard kinetic mayhem. He could have supplied more exciting personnel to smooth past the checklist his movie is filling out. Jackson a professional mixed-martial-artist isnt bad as a one-man wrecking crew who finds pacifism. And Copley a South African who played the nincompoop cop in ""District 9 is amusing but he might need an entire movie to explain himself to us. Cooper is going for the skilled shallows of Robert Downey Jr. But that just makes you miss the first hour of ""Iron Man 2 all over again.Theres an obvious risk for an established star to get involved with this mess What if the mess is a hit? Would Leonardo DiCaprio or Jamie Foxx want to be obligated to do ""A-Team 6? Carnahan wrote the script with Skip Woods and the actor Brian Bloom (who plays the sort of stock baddie that it often took Steven Seagal 90 minutes to kill). Theyre not making a movie. Theyre making a franchise. The individual installments no longer have to make sense. The last scene just has to wink (or smirk) toward a future episode -- like a comic book or a television program.When it was on NBC during the 1980s ""The A-Team made the most of a mediocre situation. The show gave George Peppard a stage for his good looks and panache. He got to be tough grizzled and macho without appearing terribly bitter that a career spent yea close to achieving classic movie stardom in the 1950s and 1960s ended more or less on a program about Vietnam-war veterans betrayed into doing mercenary work. Peppard got on well with his fellow soldiers a likable cast of relative unknowns -- Dirk Benedict Dwight Schultz Mr. T.The show lasted for four seasons and made a cult item of Mr. T. But it was only loosely distinguishable from other so-so action-adventure-detective-military shows from that period -- ""Crazy Like a Fox ""Simon amp; Simon ""Manimal  ""Airwolf ""MacGyver ""Stingray ""Riptide The Fall Guy. Are these memories we want to relive even in jest? Judging from the poisonous response to the ""MacGyver spoof ""MacGruber the answer appears to be no.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The A-Teams titular aggregation of Army Rangers-turned-outlaws spend an awful lot of time cracking up and flashing shit-eating grins. Theyre such a smiley guffaw-happy bunch that it can sometimes be hard to tell what theyre laughing about beyond their palpable delight in being awesome manly men whose lives are filled with heroism and derring-do. That spirit of smug self-satisfaction pervades the film which high-fives itself at every opportunity. Newly minted action hero Liam Neeson chomps on a cigar and plenty of scenery as Hannibal the alpha-male leader of the A-Team a quartet of Army over-achievers who go on the lam after a daring Iraq mission goes awry and theyre framed for a crime they didnt commit. Bradley Cooper flashes a ubiquitous smirk as Face the preening narcissistic lothario of the group while District 9 standout Sharlto Copley outmugs Neeson as the teams lunatic pilot Murdock and UFC fighter Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson is burdened with the thankless task of impersonating Mr. T in his signature role as B.A. Baracus. Smoking Aces director Joe Carnahan and his co-screenwriters Brian Bloom and Skip Woods litter the film with constant crowd-pleasing references to the most remembered iconic elements of the original 80s TV show; if audience members were to take a shot every time Jackson pities a fool or expresses reservations about air travel or Neeson expresses his supreme satisfaction with a scheme being successfully executed theyd pass out within the first half-hour. Itd be tempting to say The A-Team reduces its leads to glib cartoon characters but the characters were already macho caricatures in their television incarnation. The A-Team merely soups up Stephen J. Cannells campy action hit with expensive production values and lots of shit blowing up good. The films featherweight tone and self-conscious excess would be a lot more palatable if everyone didnt seem so insufferably pleased with themselves. The film acts as if its won the race before the starting gun has even been fired.

Pithy descriptions dont come easy after a brain-fragmenting experience like this movie version of the unaccountably popular 70s TV show. The A-Team are a quartet of rogue special ops warriors fighting crime as they flee federal authorities and though writer-director Joe Carnahan stays true to the source material by delivering carnage without consequence (the machine gun-toting bad guys still cant hit a barn from the inside) his convoluted plot and multiple villains may challenge the attention span of the target demographic. Liam Neeson phones it in as smirking squad leader Hannibal Smith; Patrick Wilson (Lakeview Terrace) upstages the whole crew as a CIA turncoat.

The A-Team (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies The A-Team (PG-13) This is the movie G.I. Joe should have been. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald6/10/2010 Editor rating 2.5 ``Overkill is underrated says a member of The A-Team befitting a movie in which an armored tank parachutes through the air a helicopter flies upside-down and Jessica Biel convincingly portrays a no-nonsense Army investigator. All of these things are theoretically possible. But The A-Team sells them with such bombast and flair that you know the filmmakers are in on the joke. This is the movie G.I. Joe should have been. The genius of a feature film based on the 1980s TV series is that it cant help but exceed expectations that are so low to begin with. I never watched the series and know nothing about it except that it co-starred Mr. T who sported his iconic mohawk and was the teams toughest member. In the new incarnation Mr. Ts character is played by Quinton ``Rampage Jackson a mixed-martial-arts and UFC fighting champion. Jackson also sports a finely groomed mohawk and though he never actually says the phrase he has the words ``pity and ``fool tattooed on his knuckles. A lot of director Joe Carnahans humor is of the wink-nudge variety -- an elbow to the ribs and then to prove hes not completely kidding a spectacular action sequence that must set a record for onscreen explosions. The rest of the A-Team is comprised of Liam Neeson (loyal brave leader) Bradley Cooper (irrepressible playboy) and District 9s Sharlto Cooper (a talented pilot and also completely insane). The plot which involves the heroes being framed and sent to prison and some stolen counterfeiting money-pressing plates practically defies you to follow its turns. When one character says ``What is happening? What is going on? you know the filmmakers are having a good-natured laugh at your expense. The A-Team is a gigantic pile of ear-deafening nonsense but it is brisk and goofy and well shot by Carnahan (Smokin Aces). Did this mostly forgotten series really deserve to be dusted off and turned into a film franchise? Probably not. But logic and common sense have no business in a movie in which even the characters cant keep track of whats going on.

Hannibal Smiths signature credos ""Overkill is underrated."" The A-Team Fair to good Director Joe Carnahan. Cast Liam Neeson Bradley Cooper Jessica Biel. Rating Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence throughout language and smoking. RELATED A-Team role suits Quinton Rampage Jackson to a (Mr.) T Spotlight Liam Neeson Spotlight Jessica Biel Off with their shirts Wrestlers in the movies Director Joe Carnahan who also co-wrote the script takes that maxim to the extreme with outrageous action sequences that are way over the top nowhere near believable and a whole lot of big dumb fun. If you are a stickler for movies that follow the laws of say physics nature and common sense ""The A-Team"" might not be for you. If on the other hand you get a kick out of exchanges like this - ""Are they trying to shoot down that other drone?"" ""No. Theyre trying to fly that tank"" - then youre in for a treat. The film is based of course on the popular 1980s television show also short on realism but fairly long on fun. The characters from the original (now veterans of the Iraq war not Vietnam) are here Smith (Liam Neeson) the cool-headed leader with the byzantine plans; Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck (Bradley Cooper) a charismatic thief; Capt. H.M. Murdock (Sharlto Copley) a gifted pilot who happens to be insane; and Sgt. Bosco ""B.A."" Baracus (Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson) the muscle-bound mechanic. We get a lot of back story first telling us how the group came together (an extended escape from Mexico before the opening credits are done) and then how like their television forebears they were framed for a crime they didnt commit. Federal prisons being more of a momentary imposition than a place of confinement to this bunch theyre soon back in the field trying to recover a set of stolen U.S. currency plates the very thing that got them into so much trouble in the first place. A shifty CIA operative named Lynch (Patrick Wilson supremely unctuous and a delight because of it) is on hand to complicate matters. Brian Bloom who also worked on the script has a nice turn as a freelance thug. (A scene in which he has to instruct a dimwit CIA agent in how to kill him is particularly funny.) And Jessica Biel does just fine as an Army officer on the hunt for the A-Team in part because she thinks theyre guilty and in part because of a romance with Face that went south some time ago. (Bitter much? These two are.) Things go boom impressively though some of the action is so chaotic its hard to tell whos doing what to whom. (Its a safe bet of course that our boys will land on their feet.) But its the core team that makes ""The A-Team"" tick and its members wisely dont try to take things too seriously. On the other hand how could they? They dont play the material for out-and-out laughs as much as they just color everything with a wink and a nod. Its temping to say that youre better off not thinking about the plot and how tenuously it all holds together. The truth is youre better off not thinking at all. Its not as if Carnahan allows you a moments break to contemplate whats going on anyway. Instead he just keeps the bombast coming. Thats not always such a good thing. But here with the winning chemistry of the cast and the sheer nuttiness of the action scenes (coupled it must be said with the unusually poor marksmanship of all the bad guys) it works. ""The A-Team"" is not a great movie and its probably a stretch to call it a good one. But theres no denying that its a fun one. And theres not nearly enough of that to go around.

Magnifying TV series to the screen has hardly been hiccup-free (see ""I Spy"" and ""The Mod Squad"") often squandering the warm rush of nostalgia. ""The A-Team"" meets this challenge with loud chaotic and fairly relentless action best enjoyed (a la the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise) by simply admiring the explosions and silliness without dwelling too much on the skeletal plot. Frankly a little less budgeting for visual effects -- in exchange for more physicality and sharper character interplay -- would have improved matters but the pic still works moderately well as the equivalent of a mindless B-movie -- and should reward Fox accordingly. ""The A-Team"" certainly has a sizable footprint in TV history having done as much as any of the classier shows Brandon Tartikoff ordered up in the 1980s to help rouse a then-moribund NBC from its ratings doldrums. For the most part director Joe Carnahan (""Smokin Aces"") -- who collaborated on the script with Skip Woods and co-star Brian Bloom -- adhere pretty closely to the basic premise albeit with some mandatory timeline changes shifting the central quartet from Vietnam to Iraq. Introduced one by one in a bustling and extended opening action setpiece these Special Forces officers are led by Hannibal (Liam Neeson) a strategic mastermind who excels at hatching intricately staged operations. His unit consists of ladies man Face (Bradley Cooper); brawler and vehicle specialist B.A. Baracus (mixed-martial artist Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson); and pilot extraordinaire/certified lunatic Murdock (""District 9s"" Sharlto Copley who steals practically every scene hes in with wild-eyed abandon). Under the stewardship of Gen. Morrison (Gerald McRaney) the four mount a secret mission to recover missing counterfeiting plates in Baghdad but theyre double-crossed land in prison and must escape to clear their names -- with the help of a shadowy if suspect CIA agent (Patrick Wilson). Meanwhile Faces ex Charissa (Jessica Biel) is a military officer in hot pursuit of the fugitives. Alas as constructed thats all the plot the movie can handle with as little down time as possible between frenetic sequences that invariably entail something -- planes buildings the Port of Los Angeles -- getting blown up. The challenge is to make the capers sufficiently thrilling and still maintain a light slightly tongue-in-cheek tone which pays off only intermittently. Fortunately the elite-team-takes-on-the-world premise is familiar enough to quickly be comprehensible to those who might not get every inside reference like B.A. having ""pity"" and ""fool"" tattooed on his fists. And even if misty with age the brand is better known than something like say ""The Losers."" Although some action sequences prove too busy the stuntwork is impressive and credit Alan Silvestri with deftly weaving Mike Post and Pete Carpenters jaunty TV theme into his score. One other footnote While employing Iraq as a backdrop is perhaps tolerable there ought to be some kind of rule against a movie with this much mayhem invoking the teachings of Gandhi ostensibly as an excuse to give Neeson a chance to fleetingly flex his muscles doing something other than snarling. Thats a rare overreach however in a project that otherwise appears to have a clear sense of its central mission which is to reboot the TV franchise and potentially set up a template for further adventures -- even if ""The A-Team"" is another minor-league player on a major-league payroll.
