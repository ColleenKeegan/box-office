"Sorry Charlie washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Sorry Charlie The Oompa Loompas above hold up the candy empire and greedy Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) gobbles copious amounts of candy in Tim Burtons ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" (Photos By Peter Mountain -- Warner Bros.) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 15 2005 What will Johnny do? That has been the question on filmgoers minds since it was announced just after Johnny Depps triumphant channeling of Keith Richards in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" that he would next play Willy Wonka in Tim Burtons ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Would Depp channel Michael Jackson this time? Or the roles 1971 originator Gene Wilder? Or would he surprise the oddsmakers with something completely characteristically out there? Depps Wonka is certainly out there but -- perhaps because of all the speculative hype perhaps because remake fatigue is setting in -- its a major comedown. Sashaying through a performance that seems to be more about his teeth than anything else Depp has chosen some odd spirits to aid him in his journey to find his inner Willy. Theres a smidgen of Mr. Rogers here a bit of Dana Carveys Church Lady there; the exaggerated top hat foppish coat and waxy green pallor suggest a creature worthy of Dr. Seuss and those prosthetic choppers cant help but recall Depps own performance as the title character in Burtons 1994 movie ""Ed Wood."" And that hair--a lacquered pageboy with wisps of Mamie Eisenhower bangs -- that hair can bring to mind only one person these days and thats the currently incarcerated New York Times reporter Judith Miller. The cumulative effect isnt pretty. Nor is it kooky funny eccentric or even mildly interesting. Indeed throughout his fey simpering performance Depp seems to be straining so hard for weirdness that the entire enterprise begins to feel like those excruciating occasions when your parents tried to be hip. If you have to try that hard you just arent. Similarly Burton whose keen imagination has come up with an eye-popping palette and occasionally brilliant production design has labored so hard to make Wonka his own -- giving him a tedious back story replete with daddy issues -- that hes lost all the subtle humor and understatement that made Roald Dahls original story and Mel Stuarts 1971 adaptation ""Willy Wonka amp; the Chocolate Factory"" so charming in the first place. You know youre in Burtons world from the movies lovely opening sequences which unfold in a snowy modern-day city that could pass for Victorian London. The place is dominated by a chocolate factory that seems plucked fresh from a Pink Floyd album cover. The look is vintage Burton from its bold austere aesthetic to its pristine attention to detail; whether its the retro-looking Wonka delivery bikes or the catawampus shack where Charlie Bucket and his family live Burton has created a universe full of vibrant color imagination and warmth. Then the faces start to melt off the singing puppets and you remember that Burtons world can be a very dark place indeed. Those puppets appear half an hour into ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" serving as mechanized greeters at Willy Wonkas mysterious candy business which Charlie (Freddie Highmore) and four other young winners of Golden Tickets are about to tour. Fans of the original ""Willy Wonka"" are familiar with Charlies cohorts theres the bratty Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) the competitive Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb) the candy-guzzling Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) and the television-addicted Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry). Shortly after the puppets short-circuit and are promptly engulfed in flames Wonka himself appears whispering ""Good morning Starshine"" in a creepy breathy falsetto. The ensuing downward spiral serves only to remind audiences why the original ""Willy Wonka"" has been an enduring family hit Its because Stuart understood that Dahls story wasnt just a fanciful tour through kids imaginations but a devastating social satire. Most of the movies action centered on the media frenzy bare-knuckled greed and warped ambition that erupted over the Golden Tickets; Wonkas factory tour was a sly commentary -- delivered by Wilder with characteristically mordant understatement -- not just on the gluttony selfishness snootiness and laziness the characters embodied but also on the odiousness of kids and overweening parents in general. Despite its title the kids in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" have been all but lost. They still receive their individual comeuppances -- accompanied by MTV-era song-and-dance numbers by the Oompa Loompas -- but the satirical edge has been dulled in a film that is dominated and ultimately swamped by its stars mannered pixilated performance. And so many flashbacks there are from old Dr. Wonka burning young Willys Halloween candy to Willys later trip to Oompa Loompa Land where he discovered the tribe of tiny brown men he would bring back to enslave -- sorry employ -- as laborers in his candy empire. Reportedly political activists plan to hand out information at theaters playing ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" informing viewers of the real-life chocolate industrys exploitative labor practices. Considering Willys paternalistic post-colonial relationship with his ""beloved Oompa Loompas"" -- here portrayed as digitized copies of the Indian actor Deep Roy -- they seem pretty ripe for organizing themselves. But such subtext is much less important to Burton than style which ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" admittedly has in abundance from its gorgeous set design (the factorys nut-cracking room is particularly groovy) to Willys ever-changing wardrobe of Jackie O. sunglasses. Still the films strenuous efforts at becoming a camp classic eventually begin to wear thin. ""Why is everything here so utterly pointless?"" a character wails at one point. As Burton shoves ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" down yet one more digressive if fantastic-looking path viewers may well find themselves asking that very question. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (115 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for quirky situations action and mild profanity.

Though hes the master of all things sweet his demeanor is anything but. Viewers may find Depps Willy Wonka loopy bewildering and off-putting but never boring. Warner Bros. Still Depp deserves kudos for fashioning an original and outlandish if occasionally menacing character in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It couldnt have been easy to take on a role so memorably etched by Gene Wilder in Willy Wonka amp; the Chocolate Factory three decades ago. Wilders Wonka may have been eccentric and enigmatic but those qualities are intensified when Depp dons the mantle of the bizarre chocolatier. Depps androgynously idiosyncratic performance surely qualifies as the most disquieting in a career filled with quirky roles. This adaptation of Roald Dahls 1964 childrens classic is a faithful one filtered through the vivid imagination of director Tim Burton. But as wondrously whimsical as the movie is -- it is a marvel of rich colorful design and flair -- Depps discomfitingly creepy Wonka tends to overshadow the rest of the films attributes. One cant help but wonder about the subtext of the film when Depps peculiar alabaster-skinned persona has flashes of Michael Jackson. But love it or hate it Depps sadistic and snippy Wonka is audacious. About the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory    1/2 (out of four) Stars Johnny Depp Freddie Highmore David Kelly Deep Roy Christopher Lee Helena Bonham Carter Director Tim Burton Distributor Warner Bros. Running time 1 hour 55 minutes Rated PG for quirky situations action and mild language Opens Friday nationwide The story concerns five children selected to visit a mysterious candy factory. No one had been seen entering or exiting the place for years but after a much-publicized contest Wonka leads the winners each accompanied by a relative on a guided tour of the factorys fabulous inner workings. Four of the kids are obnoxious disobedient and greedy brats. But the fifth Charlie Bucket (Finding Neverlands Freddie Highmore) is loyal brave and kind. Hes also rather bland but thats heightened by the contrast with Wonkas flamboyant weirdness. Dahl was making a statement about overindulgence with characters such as the gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) spoiled Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) gum-chomping Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb) and TV-obsessed know-it-all Mike Teavee (Jordon Fry). An especially entertaining segment is the back story of how the tiny Oompa Loompas came to the chocolate factory and the diminutive Deep Roy is a standout. Wonka has flashbacks about his childhood and his imposing father (Christopher Lee). Not part of Dahls story this was invented by screenwriter John August (Big Fish). Viewers may find Wonka loopy bewildering and off-putting but never boring. With its dazzling sets and fabulous special effects Charlie is a visual feast from the dragon-headed boat made of pink spun sugar bolting across a chocolate river to the elaborately kaleidoscopic song-and-dance numbers. Charlies dilapidated but delightfully cozy home is an architectural marvel. Dahls familiar tale feels extraordinary and dreamlike thanks to Burtons creative interpretation. It emerges as the summers most visually arresting escapist adventure.

Starring Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore. Directed by Tim Burton. (PG. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" director Tim Burton does his best work in years. The story provides endless opportunities for him to let loose his visual imagination and his caustic humor finds outlet in the baroque mishaps that befall various deserving characters and in the personality of Willy Wonka  presented here as a man with a screw loose. It says something about Johnny Depps portrayal of Willy that for all the movies visual extravagance audiences will walk out talking about Depp. This time Depp doesnt rely on quirky mannerisms but creates and inhabits a complete character an eccentric whose serene facade is a veneer over an inner life of jangled nerves resentment and childhood wounds. Willy is remarkably self-controlled. He rarely says what hes thinking but the audience can read his thoughts -- and his struggle to stay polite as well as the frequent discord between his thoughts and his demeanor becomes extremely funny. It becomes funnier in fact as the movie goes on. Related Stories A factory that doubles as funhouse Based on the childrens book by Roald Dahl of the same name ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is about a boy (Freddie Highmore) from a poor but loving family who lives in the town where Willy Wonka has his world-famous factory. Charlies family is so poor that they eat cabbage soup every night and only once a year does Charlie get a chocolate bar on his birthday. A leisurely opening related by Charlies grandfather tells us of the history of the Wonka factory from its beginnings to the fateful day when Willy fired his workers and closed his gates to the public. Since then the factory has kept operating through automation and other mysterious means. Charlie dreams of one day being able to go inside the factory and his hopes are raised when Willy announces through a written statement that he will allow five children accompanied by their parents to visit the chocolate factory for a daylong tour. The odds of winning an invitation are remote -- golden invitations have been inserted inside five randomly selected candy bars -- and Charlie watches sadly as four children each horrible in his or her own way find a ticket. But of course Charlie ultimately finds one too and on the appointed day he and his grandfather are there with the four other kids and their parents standing outside the gate of the Wonka factory. Until the entrance of Willy Wonka ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" seems as if its going to be just a well-made childrens story with exceptional art direction and a few flashes of knowing irreverence there to keep adults from slipping into a coma. But once those gates open it becomes a different movie. The children are welcomed by a musical production number staged with automated puppets that accidentally burst into flames. And then Willy appears in his Prince Valiant haircut and green gloves looking almost as pale and acting almost as strangely as Michael Jackson. Depp plays Willy as someone who has been out of social circulation for years. He lives in his own imagination surrounded by a tiny race of workers known as the Oompa-Loompas and so being around these kids -- especially the four brats -- is a strain. It also brings up memories of his own childhood which the movie renders in comical flashbacks in which Willys father a dentist refuses to let him eat candy. The dentist father also explains why Willy has blindingly white ridiculously perfect teeth. Once the film gets inside the factory it takes on a structural sameness. But it staves off monotony thanks to the clever script Depps consistently amusing performance and the startling and inventive scenes and sets. Theres a chocolate waterfall and Willie and his guests travel on a chocolate river on a red ship in the shape of a candy seahorse. In one room a pink sheep is being sheared. That takes up maybe 15 seconds of the movie but its beautiful and stays in the mind. Theres a wonderful scene of squirrels -- about a hundred of them -- sitting on white stools in a blue room shelling walnuts to be used in Willys chocolate bars. Its also worth mentioning that all of the Oompa-Loompas are played by the same actor (Deep Roy). The brats are conveyed in broad strokes and played with gusto by the child actors. Theres a German glutton (Philip Wiegratz) a spoiled rich girl (Julia Winter) a know-it-all (Jordan Fry) and a competitive sports monster (AnnaSophia Robb). Interestingly in photographing these kids everything is done to make their faces perfectly smooth like computer animation characters. It has the nice effect of making them at once more beautiful and more inhuman. If all the laughs come from Depp who gives Willy the mannerisms of a classic Hollywood diva the films heart comes from Highmore a gifted young performer who had a leading role in ""Finding Neverland."" His performance is sincere deep and unforced in a way thats rare in a child actor. -- Advisory Bratty child behavior and mild mayhem.

First as much as I liked ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" as a kid its hard to call the 1971 film based on Roald Dahls novel fine moviemaking. That would be a little like saying the equally catchy campy ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" was genius. Watching Gene Wilders Wonka recently only confirmed the musicals melt-away qualities. Second I am a sucker for tales that celebrate the grandparent-grandchild bond. Dahls 1964 story about a boy who wins a ticket to visit a mysterious candy factory places youngster Charlie Buckets four grandparents front and center. Literally. His elders lie in a bed smack in the middle of the impoverished Bucket household. Grandpa George and Grandpa Georgina face Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephine. Supper takes place between them in a house that is more a shack situated in a city experiencing economic doldrums. But this song of praise isnt about being a sucker. It is about Burtons intoxicating blend of light and dark flavors. Always gifted with the fanciful the director of ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Big Fish"" has whipped Dahls wonder into a lovely confection that may have healing properties. With the nutty help of Johnny Depp as Wonka and a never-saccharine performance from Freddie Highmore as Charlie Burton and screenwriter John August honor Dahl while adding some sprinkles of their own. Not only does this version get right the relationship between Charlie and Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) who was once an employee at the Wonka chocolate factory it has great sport with the other grandparents. David Morris Grandpa George has the best lines as the family watches television reports about the five golden tickets Wonka has hidden in his chocolate bars and the kids who find them. Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter play Charlies struggling folks. The Buckets are such a loving lot its easy to crave Charlies return from Wonkas zany world. Turns out there is no place like home. Of course there was always something disturbingly manipulative about Wilders Wonka. His was a god complex barely acknowledged save in the lyrics of the ""Candy Man."" ""Who can take a sunrise/Sprinkle it with dew?"" Who indeed? Johnny Depps Wonka is even more of a freak. Hes a superfreak. An arrested child Wonka doesnt really like kids. So neurotic is this creative genius he chokes on words like ""parent"" or ""father."" But the filmmakers have given his strange behavior a clever back story. If this ultra-successful son of a dentist (played by Christopher Lee) pronounces ""eatable"" to sound like ""Oedipal"" youll know why. Comparisons have been made between Depps portrayal of Wonka and Michael Jackson. Thats just silly. Jacksons most recent incarnation evokes Kate Jackson circa ""Charlies Angels."" Depp is pure Faye Dunaway. Denvers AnnaSophia Robb is scary-funny as gum-chomping Violet Beauregarde who along with Augustus Gloop Veruca Salt and Mike Teavee make up the other winners of golden tickets. Shes a picture-perfect mini-me portrait of her competitive Mom (Missi Pyle). In fact all the kids and parents resonate uncomfortably. There is no missing the way rich girl Verucas powerbroking dad and television-addicted Mikes schoolteacher father look painfully flummoxed by the kids theyve raised. As each brat gets his or her comeuppance the Oompa-Loompas - all played by Deep Roy - launch into a song and dance routine. The music is Danny Elfmans but the lyrics come from Dahls book. Thanks to Highmore who co-starred with Depp in ""Finding Neverland"" Charlie has regained his rightful claim to the movies title. A dewy-eyed wise child hes the fluttering heart of this tale about a child of unerring values and a wizard of odd. Charlie loves. Chocolate yes but so much more. With iconoclasts Depp and Burton leading the charge its hard not to find in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" a bittersweet allegory about the Dream Factory known as Hollywood. How fitting then that they have given a summer reeking with soulless searching by the studios - ""Oh the box-office horror the box-office horror"" - a film of delectable charm? Is it sweet? Sure. But ""Charlie"" is so much richer than that. Film critic Lisa Kennedy can be reached at 303-820-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

(CNN) -- Director Tim Burton is now batting .500 in one of Hollywoods favorite games -- remaking films.Burton didnt do well in his first remake attempt striking out with his 2001 re-do of the 1968 film ""Planet of the Apes."" But now on a much sweeter note he has solidly connected in topping the 1971 film adaptation of Roald Dahls childrens story ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (a film that was titled ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"").Burton and screenwriter John August (""Big Fish"") have stayed fairly true to Dahls original fantasy tale but theyve also improved -- with the full backing of Dahls widow Felicity -- the ending of the original book and added flashbacks to Wonkas childhood.I cant imagine anyone other than Burton attempting this project. Hes already tackled as producer another of Dahls whimsical books ""James and the Giant Peach."" Moreover very few directors can top Burton imagination when it comes to creating an alternate universe on film.Hes also had experience in telling a story about a child-like man who dresses in a funny way and relates to children ""Pee-Wees Big Adventure"" was his directorial debut 20 years ago.Mysterious eccentricAs with many childrens books ""Charlie"" is -- at its core -- a great morality tale if one covered in mounds of chocolate.The story isnt set in any particular city or time. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) an exceedingly eccentric man owns the largest chocolate factory in the world a place that makes the most delicious candies in the universe. When rival candymakers start to steal his secrets he abruptly closes the factory and fires all his workers.For years the factory stands empty but then suddenly it mysteriously comes back to life. Even more mysteriously no one ever enters or leaves the factory.No one is more fascinated with Wonka and chocolates than young Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) who lives in a dilapidated shack with his mother (Helena Bonham Carter) his father (Noah Taylor) and his four grandparents including his endearing Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) who used to work for Wonka. The films set design is brilliant says critic Paul Clinton -- as is the performance(s) of Deep Roy (left) who plays all the Oompa-Loompas. One day an announcement comes out that Wonka is opening his factory -- for just one day -- to five lucky children each of whom will be accompanied by one parent. Each child will also get a lifetime supply of chocolates and one of them will win an enormous prize. All the children have to do is find one of five chocolate bars with golden tickets among all the Wonka bars in the world.The announcement prompts a frenzy of chocolate buying which produces five winning children the gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) the spoiled Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) the perfectionist gum-chewer Violet Beauregard (Annasophia Robb) the video-addicted Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) and -- finally -- Charlie. Off they all go to visit the factory and meet the mysterious Mr. Wonka.Their -- and our -- first glimpse of Willy is a bit startling. With his white face makeup high-pitched voice strange clothing and Prince Valiant hairdo Depp seems like nothing so much as ... Michael Jackson.Depp fortunately is such a good actor that the initial impression soon wears off. He gives a risky and terrific performance.The factorys interior is an incredible monument to the talents of Burton and production designer Alex McDowell. Its a utopia where everything from fudge mountains to chocolate waterfalls is edible. The mind-boggling sets really do have to be seen to be believed.On their gameOnce inside the children learn the secret of how Wonka runs the factory. The chocolate mogul has imported little people Oompa-Loompas from distant Loompaland. With amazing skill infinite patience and the help of motion-capture technology one actor Deep Roy plays the entire community of Oompa-Loompas as they sing dance and work around the factory. Its stunning work.I also have to mention a remarkable scene in ""The Nut Room."" Burton found animal experts who actually succeeded in training 20 squirrels to shell walnuts while sitting on stools over a conveyer belt. Several more of the animals were computer-generated and effects were used for some movements but nevertheless squirrels with their short attention spans are extremely hard to train. Trust me youve never seen anything quite like this.Those familiar with the story know what happens next the children are dismissed one by one in appropriately nasty ways. Thus the way is clear for Wonka to achieve the plan he had all along.Highmore who made the whole world cry in ""Finding Neverland"" (also starring Depp who wanted him for ""Charlie"") is gifted with a deeply intuitive talent and possesses a face that holds the screen even when he has no dialogue.When it comes to filmmaking Burton and Depp are both men with unique visions. Sometimes the results have been far from perfect but theyre almost always interesting. Burton has taken us into territory never before imagined and Depp -- a thoughtful character actor who happens to have the brooding dark looks of a leading man -- has delivered layered interesting and compelling performances that work spot-on with the material.In the case of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" theyre both on their game. Its a beautifully executed visually astounding film about love and family -- making it the best film out there this summer for families everywhere.""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a Warner Bros. film.

"A Semisweet Chocolate washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On On Screen A Semisweet Chocolate Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 15 2005 ""CHARLIE AND the Chocolate Factory"" is a spectacle to be enjoyed but only as such. Its a masterful parade of inventiveness. With tongue firmly planted in gloom-and-doomy cheek director Tim Burton takes us on a ride of over-the-top proportions which entertains us while tacitly scolding our mass consumptiveness. But in a stroke of apparent self-destruction he has allowed Johnny Depp to interpret Willy Wonka as an unsettling amalgam of Michael Jackson Edward Scissorhands and Lisa Kudrows Phoebe from the TV show ""Friends."" "" Eeoow "" he says at one point with that tart Phoebe grimace and Valley accent. Played by Freddie Highmore the Charlie Chaplin-featured actor who played opposite Depp in ""Finding Neverland"" young Charlie Bucket lives with his family including four grandparents in a Dickensian British home (seemingly designed by 1920s German expressionists). His father (Noah Taylor) makes little money. His mother (Helena Bonham Carter) can only offer insipid cabbage soup to feed the family. And his grandparents lie perpetually in a large bed by the fireside. But they thrive on love and togetherness. Charlie is obsessed with the chocolate factory that looms above his dirty industrial town. Run by the reclusive Willy Wonka its heyday has been over since industrial spies stole Wonkas wonderful candy secrets and he angrily dismissed all his employees. For 15 years the factory has soldiered on apparently without workers. But now Willy has issued a worldwide contest winners of which will get to see the factorys secrets. One of them it turns out will be selected as his heir for the man who has no family. A golden ticket is hidden in five of his chocolate bars sold around the world. The lucky ones who find the tickets will get a personal tour of the factory. Charlies hopes are lit up. But his family can afford to buy Charlie only one candy bar for his birthday. One by one the winners are announced from around the world a greedy boy (Philip Wiegratz) from Germany named Augustus Gloop; a snotty rich Brit girl (Julia Winter) by the name of Veruca Salt; Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) a violent video-game-obsessed brat from Denver; and uber-competitive Barbie doll Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb) from Atlanta. Its a cinch that Charlie will eventually find the fifth and join those brats on the grand tour. And it will come as no surprise that Willys going to take a liking to the down-to-earth Charlie. But while that foregone conclusion remains unconcluded we have a whole inner world to enjoy a technological wonderland of chocolate (churned by waterfall) and candies; an elevator that shoots up down sideways and even slantways; and dozens of teeny-tiny people known as Oompa Loompas (all played by Deep Roy) who make the candy and can improvise an impromptu song-and-dance number like nobodys business. Willy leads the children and their overprotective competitive parental chaperones through his fantasy universe as he quietly assesses the brats for their likability. But Willys no picnic himself. He seems to hate children and he is equally inaccessible to adults giving them frosty or sarcastic responses to any smart-alecky questions or reactions they have. Mindful of the need for large-screen entertainment Burton has outdone himself from the chocolate lakes and candy-grass banks in which the abominable Augustus takes a plunge to the hilarious routines performed by the Oompa Loompas (their songs created by Burtons regular collaborator Danny Elfman). And he and screenwriter John August have not held back on the darkly humorous spirit of Roald Dahls book of the same name. By Burtons standards ""Charlie"" is one of his warmest dramas yet in terms of the family relationships enjoyed by central character Charlie. Burton never was a warm filmmaker. His antiheroes (in such films as ""Edward Scissorhands"" ""Beetle Juice"" ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" ""Mars Attacks"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"") are frequently cold tortured or barely human and their family or social relationships arent much better. He evades this seeming discomfort with human softness with inspired art direction macabre humor and other imaginative circuitry. Which is to say ""Charlie"" the movie will entertain the kids for sure. But it still feels frosty to the touch. And here comes the big asterisk. People enamored of Gene Wilders manic sweet performance in the 1971 ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" may be disappointed in Depps oddball eccentricity. Of course Depp should take things in a new direction or why bother? After all Wilders wacky persona took many liberties with Dahls original creation. But Depps Wonka is more avian than amiable. Funny and weird this Willy Wonka may be. But charming and fuzzy? Not quite. Its doubtful that Depps off-kilter interpretation will have any discernible effect on the movies success. But it remains the movies most disappointing aspect. Walk away from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and I wager youll feel not a glimmer of warmth. You may laugh and like but you wont love with the same enthusiasm. But in a dismal movie season like this summer most of us are likely to be happy with any confection that goes down this easily. CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (PG 115 minutes) -- Contains offbeat humor and situations and some mild obscenity. Area theaters.

"Tim Burtons delicious new movie. Slate Sign In Sign Up Tim Burtons delicious new movie. Tim Burtons delicious new movie. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 14 2005 734 PM Eye Candy Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is freakishly amusing. By David Edelstein Depps Wonka has emotional baggage but little variety The cloying 1971 eyesore Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory might have left you with the impression that ""the candyman can [take tomorrow dip it in a dream etc.] cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good."" (Sorry if Ive brought back the dulcet tones of Sammy Davis Jr.) But its not easy to sugarcoat Roald Dahls moralism--or sadism--in the book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in which four self-indulgent brats (but not little Charlie Bucket the darling hero) get their just uh desserts. As the reclusive candy mogul Gene Wilder used his gift for seeming insane but also a sweetheart He twinkled as he oversaw the punishment of the spoiled snoot Veruca Salt the gluttonous Augustus Gloop the gum-chewing Violet Beauregarde and the boob-tube addict Mike Teavee. In the new Tim Burton version properly titled Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Warner Bros.) Johnny Depp is not so reassuring. Hes a spaced-out whey-faced child-man with saucer eyes a blend of Carol Channing and Michael Jackson. He also has a king-sized chocolate chip on his shoulder. This is a dazzling movie yet some people (not kids but maybe their parents) will be put off by its Grand Guignol ghoulishness. And Depp does take some getting used to. He has conceived Wonka as a smiling passive-aggressive a Mr. Freeze weighed down by emotional baggage and he doesnt have much variety. Like the first Burton/Depp fusion Edward Scissorhands his Wonka is stunted--deformed by inept parenting. (The resemblance to Edward is pointed up with a gag In a flashback Wonka cuts the ribbon on his candy factory and from behind the shears extend from his sleeves.) Advertisement Edward the visionary artist tended to slash himself and other people without meaning to; it was Burtons way of saying ""I cant help my hostility its how I was made."" Wonkas dearness on the other hand is too creepy to fool anyone. Burton and screenwriter John August have added a psychological back story that isnt in the book The factory is an escape from--and a retaliation against--Wonkas repressive dentist father (played by horror great Christopher Lee) who forbade his son to eat candy and imprisoned him in a variety of medieval-torturelike braces and retainers. Now Willie is the ultimate eternal adolescent artist who shuns family (he cant even get the word ""parent"" out of his mouth) and retreats into a world of his own creation. The Neverland-as-Oedipal-revenge is very Michael Jackson too and I imagine that the extra bit of perversity helped to fuel Burtons already revved-up visual imagination. He and designer Alex McDowell plainly revel in the silky-chocolate waterfall the edible brightly colored landscape and the Rube Goldberg-like candy machines. Theres none of the dinner-theater-NutcrackerSuite tackiness of the old Willy Wonka. In Burtons chocolate factory the central park has a Dr. Seuss-like swirliness but every marvel is double-edged You can consume it and it can consume you. This movie is a riot of fiendish invention. The Oompa Loompas--diminutive tree people who keep the factory going in exchange for all the cacao beans they can eat--are all played via some of the best computer trickery Ive ever seen by the vaguely malevolent Indian actor Deep Roy. Their mocking epitaphs for each gruesomely dispatched child are show-stopping production numbers each in a different musical style Bollywood/Busby Berkeley disco etc. The music is by the impishly brilliant Danny Elfman. His name fits. Burton doesnt just savor the sets in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; he lingers on the faces too. Freddie Highmores Charlie doesnt actually have much screen time (hes a remarkably passive protagonist) but every time he gets a close-up those teacup ears make you laugh and he matches up perfectly with the gaunt Noah Taylor (as his dad) and the gaunter David Kelly (as Grandpa Joe). As Augustus Gloop Philip Wiegratz has cheeks so round and balloon-smooth I was convinced they were a special effect and Julia Winters rich-girl Veruca Salt has sharp blue eyes and exaggerated English horse-teeth. The addictions of the two other winners of the Wonka-candy-bar gold tickets have been partially updated. Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) is now a video-game zombie--perfect. And Violet Beauregarde is a fiercely driven karate expert as well as a gum-chewer. It would have been nice if Burton and August had figured out a way to work martial arts into her finale--and do martial-arts and gum-chewing even fit together? The film is set in the present but its a hodgepodge of contemporary and Victorian references and not everything gels. Candy-chemist though he is its odd to hear Wonka hold forth about chocolate and the release of endorphins. Dahl wrote some great horror stories so its no surprise that Burtons movie often edges into the macabre. Depps Wonka has a whiff of Lon Chaneys Phantom of the Opera--the master torturer. And every set-piece is a mini-horror movie. Verucas comeuppance in the Nut Room is better than anything in either Willard. The squirrels that crack the walnuts are a mixture of the real and computer-generated but the blending is seamless and they seem as sly and knowing as their master. Burtons joy makes Charlie and the Chocolate Factory freakishly amusing from start to finish even when those everlasting gobstoppers get stuck in our throats.

Directed by Tim Burton from a screenplay by John August based on the novel by Roald Dahl. 117 minutes. Rated PG for quirky situations action and mild language. Several theaters. Also opening in IMAX at the Pacific Science Center. Its fitting that we get our first glimpse of Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka in Tim Burtons darkly sweet new film of the Roald Dahl classic ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" through candy glass -- he peers at us from behind the screen of a translucent lollipop evading our gaze. As he did in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" this ever-morphing actor (hes like Wonkas candies that magically change color) slips into a new and thoroughly weird persona to play the famous candymaker. You dont know where this performance is coming from; the line readings that issue from his marshmallow-pale violet-eyed persona are always unexpected. This Wonka is nervous giggly off his rhythms unsure of himself. He needs a Charlie -- and a family -- to complete him. Wonder if you wish why Burton wanted to make another movie of a book thats already found its way to film very nicely in the 1971 Gene Wilder-starring ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" thats beloved by many. Wonder too why Depp looks and sounds just a teeny bit like Michael Jackson and why this Wonka seems clearly more freakish than the novels hyperkinetic but friendly figure. Those who fret when filmmakers take liberties with books (as inevitably they must) might be better off at home curled up with the print version of ""Charlie"" -- and a very happy evening theyll spend too. (I did it myself just the other night with my well-thumbed childhood copy of the book -- thanks Mom.) But moviegoers young and not-so-young who appreciate dazzling visuals dark humor and heartfelt storytelling shouldnt miss Burtons film which goes down as deliciously as one of Wonkas creations. Depps oddball-but-mesmerizing turn is paired with a more conventional -- and effortlessly sweet -- performance by young Freddie Highmore (who co-starred with Depp in ""Finding Neverland"") as Charlie. This boy poor in material things but rich in love and character is the storys real hero with Wonka as the character role and the two actors neatly balance each other out -- creating by the films ending a genuine bond. Along the way Burtons trademark eye for color and detail treats us to a feast. The shack in which the Bucket family lives -- Charlie his parents and four grandparents -- looks like a strong wind could blow it over; it tilts precariously to one side but its windows glow with warmth. Wonkas factory looming above the city (which appears to be a fantasy London) is by contrast forbidding; even its interiors have a darkness to them. The Oompa Loompas -- all played by one actor (Deep Roy) magically duplicated into an army -- contribute straight-from-the-book musical numbers one of which includes a nifty Busby Berkeley-esque overhead routine. And the casting is spot-on from Charlies loving family to the four other Golden Ticket holders all memorably bratty. Julia Winter as rich girl Veruca Salt shows a real comic flair; pointing her sharp little chin and shouting ""Daddy Make time go faster"" (As readers of the book know she gets her comeuppance in the form of dozens of very well-trained squirrels.) Theres plenty here for adults to enjoy (not the least of which is the spin Depp puts on lines like ""Youre all quite short arent you?"") but the film -- as was the book -- is primarily for children who should have a swell time in this magical chocolate-covered world. Very young children may find parts of it too frightening particularly the often-menacing Danny Elfman music. But the kids who accompanied me to the screening -- ages 8 and 10 -- had a swell time pronouncing it cool a little weird (in a good way) and not too scary. By its irresistibly charming ending as powdered-sugar snow falls and the narrator tells us that ""life had never been sweeter"" Burton has pulled off the near-impossible a fresh look at a classic.

Entertaining and fabulously imaginative in many ways this second bigscreen rendition of the late authors modest morality tale on the wages of unbridled excess sports excesses of its own. The wondrous surfaces have a weird undercurrent that wont go away in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" Tim Burtons richly elaborated take on Roald Dahls beloved childrens book. Entertaining and fabulously imaginative in many ways this second bigscreen rendition of the late authors modest morality tale on the wages of unbridled excess sports excesses of its own. Still most discussion will inevitably center on Johnny Depps utterly eccentric performance as reclusive chocolate magnate Willy Wonka. Kids as well as many adult fans of the star and director should combine to make the Warner Bros. release a sizable hit (if distrib could do it with ""The Polar Express"" it should be able to do it with this). But a fair number of grown-ups might find themselves becoming more preoccupied by films inscrutable subtext than by the repetitive story itself. In a role imagined by Dahl as ideal for the late British comedian Spike Milligan and played in 1971 by Gene Wilder Depp who channeled Keith Richards to great effect in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" here inescapably comes across as a close relation to Michael Jackson -- intentionally or not. The fastidious pseudo-Edwardian garb lavender gloves walking stick immaculately bobbed hair androgynous air inhumanly bluish porcelain skin and childish intonations along with his often snippy and literally dismissive attitude toward the kids he invites into his fabulous domain create an oddness as likely to give pause as to enchant. The very idea of remaking the original film released by Paramount as ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is sacrilegious to some who grew up on it although it is hard to overlook that films lackluster musical numbers and complete lack of visual style. Burtons entry is scarcely deficient in the latter category as ""Charlie"" rates as one of the most riotous explosions of color since ""The Gangs All Here"" and the advanced sophistication of effects makes so much possible now that was inconceivable three decades back. Dazzling opening credits sequence a detailing of the chocolate manufacturing process set to throbbing musical accompaniment instantly creates high expectations which are indeed fulfilled for the first 35 minutes. In an unnamed great industrial city very much like London little Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore Depps splendid co-star in ""Finding Neverland"") lives an emotionally warm but physically threadbare existence with his parents and two sets of grandparents in a ramshackle shack. This structure itself is a twisted marvel of design worthy of a great German Expressionist film its occupants a lively lot deftly caricatured by superior thesps. Burton excels at the barbed exposition. In bold controlled brush strokes he reveals how Charlie has long heard the tale of Willy Wonka from his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) who toiled at the factory until all the workers were dismissed 15 years ago. Since then chocolate production has continued apace but no one knows how and not a soul has glimpsed the owner himself. Suddenly a contest is announced in which five kids who find special gold tickets hidden in Wonka chocolates will be invited to go on a personal tour of the enormous factory to be conducted by the mysterious tycoon. In pithy and amusing fashion pic renders the international frenzy the competition sets off as the parents in privileged families buy up thousands of candy bars to indulge their sprigs while Charlies family can only muster enough money to give him one chance at the gold. The first four winners are dreadful brats Theres German fatso Augustus Gloop who stuffs his face with chocolate all day; snotty Brit aristo Veruca Salt whos every whim is Daddys command; gum-chewing Yank brat Violet Beauregarde whose mom is an older carbon copy; and American Southern smart-ass Mike Teavee a violent videogame freak. All these loathsome creatures accompanied by one parent are spoiled self-centered ill-mannered louts set up as the fully deserving recipients of Willy Wonkas unexpected sadistic streak and rep Dahls comment on the undisciplined indulgence of the privileged classes. Deprived Charlie who miraculously becomes the fifth winner seems a simple saint by comparison and he shows up with Grandpa Joe outside the Wonka factory on a wintry day in breathless anticipation of his reward. But just when the film seems poised to take flight with Depps entrance and its ""Wizard of Oz""-like passage from the deliberately muted ""real"" world into Wonkas fantastical one it begins deflating. Having been out of contact with other human beings for 15 years can perhaps explain Wonkas curious quirks strange pronouncements and his blanching whenever approached by the kids whose entreaties often provoke his instant disdain. But the flashbacks invented by scenarist John August to show the boy Willys falling out with his dentist father (Christopher Lee) only raise the question of why the adult Willy lost his English accent. As the factory tour proceeds from one extraordinary chamber to another -- the first of production designer Alex McDowells fanciful creations features hills and dales of green riven by a river of chocolate -- one child visitor after another is ""eliminated"" in semi-gruesome fashion. Unfortunately these richly deserved comeuppances become successively less amusing and they continue with musical production number accompaniment that similarly starts out smartly but rapidly pales. These song-and-dance interludes feature the Oompa-Loompas diminutive creatures Wonka imported from a dismal foreign habitat to fill his labor needs. This aspect of Dahls 1964 story has always had a slightly discomfiting colonialist tinge to it an impression scarcely diminished in Burtons handling. Casting of a single actor Deep Roy to be visually multiplied to portray all the Oompa-Loompas initially seems audacious but becomes tiresome even though composer Danny Elfman (who also provides the vocals) works hard to give each tune a strong musical definition. Before the trip is over ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" has gone from delectable to curdled and Depps performance has shrunk from bizarrely riveting to one-note and vaguely creepy turning Willy Wonka into yet another of Burtons antisocial weirdoes. But then this is scarcely the first time a Burton film has started out great only to lose its way with fanciful doodlings and lack of secure moorings. As usual with the director pic is immaculately made with invention to be found in every corner and every scene. Casting of all the supporting roles is terrific. Films wide release July 15 will be accompanied by simultaneous engagements in Imax theaters.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Warner Bros.) A Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Genre Comedy Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Johnny Depp Freddie Highmore; Director Tim Burton; Author John August; Release Date Wide 07/15/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 116; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 31 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT As Willy Wonka in Tim Burtons film of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Johnny Depp wears his hair in a bob that looks like he might have stolen it from Julie Christie in 1966 and he has milky translucent skin that gives him the appearance of a corpse made entirely of Muenster cheese. When he smiles flashing teeth that are white and pearly enough to terrify Tony Robbins its less an invitation than a threat as if his entire mouth were filled with fangs. Wearing a top hat and red velvet coat speaking in a light effeminate voice of extreme fussiness he looks and acts like a 19th-century vampire who is halfway through a sex change. Wonka the legendary candy maker may be a stone freak but he is also one of Burtons classic crackpot conjurers like Beetlejuice or Ed Wood. Depp gives a performance thats an acrid mocking put-on delivering meta-sarcasms as if they were vicious tidbits meant only for his private amusement. At first I thought he was doing his version of a manic Jim Carrey clown surfing the channels of his own brain but Depp in his stylized way never breaks character never goes for the easy self-referential multimedia gag. He maintains the paradox the mystery of Willy Wonka a misanthrope who has little patience for children who cant even utter the word ""parents"" without gagging yet who invents for those same kids the purest and most luscious candies out of the sugar dream of his imagination. Its become an uncomfortable experience in movies to watch Burton the prankish mod-goth fantasist working to twist himself into ""mainstream"" shapes. His last two films Big Fish and Planet of the Apes lurched in and out of formula but Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which has been faithfully adapted from Roald Dahls great 1964 childrens novel is a delectably sustained flight of fancy. Its filled with puckish deranged Burton touches like the all-singing all-melting puppets that herald Wonkas arrival but its also a grand and transporting celebration of the primal pleasures of childhood -- namely family and candy. As Wonka gives five children who have all found his Golden Tickets a tour of his famous factory with its edible garden and chocolate waterfall its kooky sci-fi chambers for testing out revolutionary new delights he makes no secret of the fact that with the possible exception of Charlie (Freddie Highmore) a modest English lad as gracious as he is poor he despises them all. He has good reason The other children are brats pigs rich little bullies of entitlement. Burton gives us acidly funny new versions of the spoiled-rotten monsters you may remember from the 1971 Willy Wonka amp; the Chocolate Factory -- big babies like the German porker Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) the spiteful princess Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) and the television (now videogame) sociopath Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry). If anything they seem timelier now in an era when so many kids do get everything they want. As Wonka vents his disdain though its still a comic shock to see an adult interact with children as if they were something hed prefer to be roasting on a spit. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory revives in a sassier but more artful way the pixilated whimsy of Willy Wonka amp; the Chocolate Factory. The earlier film was driven of course by the creepy cuddliness of Gene Wilder -- the smile of cozy dimpled warmth giving way to hysteria then snapping back. Burton and Depp push Wonka further making him into a sinister enigma and in flashbacks to his childhood we see how he got that way His father (Christopher Lee) a dentist treated candy like poison and forced the boy to wear a torture chamber of a head brace. If that all sounds a bit Freudian what it does is turn the entire film into a fairy-tale meditation on our relationship to candy why its wrong to love it too little or too much. As the children are vanquished one by one from the chocolate factory each done in by greedy overindulgence Burton makes the factory a place of blooming danger and wonder. The army of live squirrels shelling walnuts the sight of Violet blowing up into a blueberry -- these are indelible Burton images. The director also has a blast reinventing Wonkas army of pint-size assistants the Oompa-Loompas. All of them are played with digital replication by Deep Roy who looks like the deadpan maitre d of an Indian restaurant and they appear in songs of various styles and eras (Esther Williams psychedelic rock) scored with catchy deviltry by Danny Elfman. Those Oompa-Loompas are the beat and soul of Burtons finest movie since Ed Wood a madhouse kiddie musical with a sweet-and-sour heart.

"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory ) Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli If there is any living director who can do justice to the warped nature of Roald Dahls ""childrens stories"" its Tim Burton. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isnt the first time these two have ""collaborated."" Burton produced Henry Selicks animated James and the Giant Peach but this time hes in the directors chair with his favorite star in the cameras crosshairs. Although this movie is an adaptation of one of Dahls best loved stories Charlie and the Chocolate Factory feels like Burton through-and-through - from the bits and pieces cut from Edward Scissorhands to an ending that hearkens back to the theme of father/son affection from Big Fish. Let me dispense with the obvious comparison immediately this version is more faithful and substantive than Mel Stuarts foppish 1971 production Willy Wonka amp; the Chocolate Factory. Somehow - probably because many of my generation saw this year-after-year on television during our youths - that overrated motion picture has become a classic. Dahl hated it and its no wonder why the edgy became genial Willy Wonky was transformed into a father figure and the Oompa Loompas sang lame songs (okay so one or two of those tunes are catchy). In making this movie Burton shoulders aside Stuarts film and returns to the source material. The result is faithful enough to have earned the Dahl familys seal of approval. As the movie opens we learn that Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) the famous candy-maker recluse has hidden golden tickets inside the wrappers of five of the millions of Wonka candy bars sold around the world. Those lucky enough to find them will be treated to a tour of the Wonka candy facility - the largest chocolate factory in the world. Gradually the winners are revealed. The first is Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) a pig of a boy who considers chocolate to be his primary food group. The second is Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) the most spoiled girl in England. Her pantywaist father (Edward Fox) denies her nothing. Winner 3 is Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb) an overachiever who turns mundane activities into contests she must win. The fourth is Mike Teavee (Jordon Fry) a super-intelligent video game addict who thinks the world revolves around the television and electronics. Finally winner 5 is Londoner Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) a poor boy who uses his last money to buy the winning candy bar. Accompanied by his grandfather Joe (David Kelly) he arrives at the Wonka factory at the appointed hour ready to begin the tour. The inside of Willy Wonkas factory is like a warped version of Disneyworld crossed with Oz. There are chocolate waterfalls and flying glass elevators. All of the work is done by the pint sized Oompa Loompas (all played by Deep Roy who is replicated via CGI) who never once sing anything about ""dippity-doo."" However they do singa| and dance. Their numbers vary from rock to Bollywood while using music by Danny Elfman and lyrics from Dahls book. Whether you like them or hate them (and I fall into the former category) the songs dont last long so this places Charlie and the Chocolate Factory into the category of a fractured fairy tale not a musical. Still theres plenty of satire and wit in these songs - most of which will go over the heads of children in the audience. The films message is a positive one - overindulgence and selfishness are bad things - but it is conveyed in a rather shocking manner as one-by-one Charlies companions suffer cruel fates. Alls well that ends well I suppose but theres a moment when it looks like Violet is going to become Tim Burtons answer to Monty Pythons infamous Mr. Creosote. (She doesnt of course since this is a PG-rated movie.) Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a family film but it is off the beaten track. Its darker than Willy Wonka and the gaudy set decoration and special effects are light years ahead of what they were 34 years ago. Johnny Depps portrayal of Wonka is creepy. This is the kind of man one wouldnt feel safe leaving a child alone with. Every once in a while he says something unexpected. Consider for example his introduction to a chamber in his factory ""Everything in this room is edible. Even Im edible. But that is called cannibalism and its frowned upon in most societies."" Does Depps Wonka recall Michael Jackson? Without question and some of the mannerisms are so similar that its impossible to believe its a coincidence. Depp and Burton have said that the portrayal is based on Howard Hughes and Edward Scissorhands and its not hard to see those influences as well. In fact Burton pays explicit homage to his earlier movie in a scene in which Wonka is shown hefting a pair of large scissors to cut a ribbon. Young Freddie Highmore acquits himself admirably as Charlie and what he accomplishes here may help to dispel the memory of Peter Ostrums hideous acting in the same role more than three decades ago. This is Highmores second consecutive outing opposite Depp - the two appeared in Finding Neverland. The supporting cast is filled out nicely. Helena Bonham Carter (Burtons current off-screen leading lady) and Noah Taylor play Charlies parents. And veteran Irish character actor David Kelly is Grandpa Joe. Kelly has enjoyed a long and fruitful career with recent international screen roles in films like Waking Ned Devine and The Matchmaker but he may be best-known as the infamous Mr. OReilly from John Cleeses Fawlty Towers. The mixture of the gothic and the jaunty makes Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a sometimes topsy-turvy experience. In terms of how it works its not unlike Little Shop of Horrors the musical comedy about murder mayhem and a giant Venus Fly Trap. Theres a dark side to that movies fun as well. (Both films feature a shot from inside a mouth as a dentist performs a procedure.) By adding a subplot about Willy and his father Burton gives his lead character and the story an added emotional component. Its hard to say what fans of Willy Wonka amp; the Chocolate Factory will make of this movie - many of the basic elements are the same but the ""feel"" is entirely different. Lovers of Dahls book however will almost certainly appreciate what Burton has wrought.
