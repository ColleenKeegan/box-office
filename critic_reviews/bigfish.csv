Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Ewan McGregor Review or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- The fantasy/drama ""Big Fish"" is the best work to date from one of Hollywoods most eccentric and innovative directors Tim Burton. Stories real and imagined are blended with total delight in this myth-laden movie about a man named Edward Bloom. Bloom played by Albert Finney loves to spin tales about his extraordinary life full of improbable adventures -- including those involving a giant named Karl a one-eyed witch conjoined Korean lounge singers and (yes) a big fish that refused to be caught. Bloom never lets the facts get in the way of telling a good story and for years these yarns about his wild adventures have charmed everyone around him -- everyone except his estranged son Will played by Billy Crudup. As Will grows up the stories begin to lose their charm when he realizes just how wild they really are and how his father uses them to disguise his real self. Eventually the two men are driven apart. But when Edward becomes fatally ill his wife Sandra played by Jessica Lange attempts to bring her husband and son together to be reconciled. For Will its an opportunity to try to separate his fathers myths from reality. Its not an easy chore. Back in time Now the past and present become intermingled as Edward once again spins his tales. We meet Edward as a young man played by Ewan McGregor and Sandra as a young woman played by Alison Lohman. As Will struggles to separate fact from fantasy we follow the younger Edward on his magical exploits. Jessica Lange plays Finneys characters wife; her younger self is played by Alison Lohman seen here. ""Big Fish"" is based on the Daniel Wallace novel ""Big Fish A Story of Mythic Proportions"" and was adapted for the big screen by John August. The fish of the title refers not only to all of those tales about ""the fish that got away"" but also Edwards desire for adventure and his determination to explore the world not to be a big fish in a small pond. His stories are also extremely ""fishy"" -- and like a fish Edward can be very slippery when he wants to be. On the surface this is a wonderful tale beautifully caught on film by director of photography Philippe Rousselot who won an Oscar for his work on 1993s ""A River Runs Through It."" His cinematography combined with Burtons exquisite imagination helps this film sweep you -- visually and emotionally -- into an alternate universe. But dig deeper and ""Big Fish"" is also a compelling look at the relationships between fathers and sons and the child coming to terms with the parents mortality. Great cast great performances The movie is filled with director Tim Burtons trademark absurd and fantastical images. The casting is picture-perfect. McGregor is brilliant as the young Edward and Lohman is astounding as Langes lookalike younger self. Lange herself is heartbreaking as a woman facing the loss of her husband and Finney turns in an award-worthy performance as Edward at the end of his days. Crudup gives a strong well-measured performance as the son in search of his fathers past. Danny DeVito is excellent in a small role as a circus owner who hires the young Edward and Steve Buscemi plays a character who goes from poet to bank robber to Wall Street baron. Helena Bonham Carter -- Burtons off-screen romantic partner -- gives a delightful turn as the one-eyed witch. ""Big Fish"" is indeed a fish story worth telling -- and pardon the pun but this movie has Oscar bait written all over it. ""Big Fish"" opened in limited release last month and goes nationwide on Friday January 9. Its rated PG-13.

Starring Ewan McGregor Billy Crudup and Albert Finney. Directed by Tim Burton. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Big Fish"" the latest from director Tim Burton is a long-winded indulgence in tear-and-a-smile whimsy elevated above the merely irritating and saccharine by compelling art direction. Its a pretty movie about a teller of tall tales -- or an insufferable liar depending on ones point of view - - who cant string together two sentences without bringing in a giant a witch or a very big fish. Its a strange one a cold film that pretends at warmth clinical and bloodless in its approach despite the frequent close-ups of people smiling. It presents its generalized whimsy as deep emotion and its colorful spectacle as fantastic imaginings. It pretends to celebrate the human spirit even as its ungenerous to any character save the protagonist. Indeed maybe the best way to enjoy ""Big Fish"" is to imagine the heros fantasies as ones own because to do the opposite -- to see the hero dispassionately from without -- is to understand how hideous it would be to actually know such a horrid gas bag. Based on the Daniel Wallace novel ""Big Fish A Novel of Mythic Proportions"" the film is the story of Edward Bloom a salesman in Alabama played as an old man by Albert Finney and in flashbacks by Ewan McGregor. In the modern scenes Edward is sick and Will (Billy Crudup) his son has come to Alabama in the hope of finally penetrating the old mans nonsense. He wants to get to know his father before its too late. Picture an old storyteller and someone like Burl Ives or Wilford Brimley might come to mind someone with a twinkle and some basic warmth. Finney goes in another direction. He plays Edward as a man for whom stories form a kind of protective wall not only between himself and reality but also between himself and any real contact with other people. Its an intriguing choice but its also one that suggests pathology. And it runs counter to the one thing everyone in the movie insists is true that Edward is one phenomenally endearing fellow. As played by Finney with Burtons apparent approval Edward is a stern wall of denial. He doesnt want to know anybody because he doesnt want to be known. This calls into question the movies other assertion that in Edwards stories lies a deeper truth than can be found in surface fact. On the contrary Edwards stories are fantasies that lead purposely into dead ends. Theyre not parables. Hes not trying to communicate with anyone -- hes trying to ward them off especially his son. In the terms of ""Big Fish"" Edward is a grand spirit and his son is a stick-in-the-mud a prosaic soul who lacks his fathers poetry. But theres nothing grand about this closed-off tiresome man just as theres nothing wrong with the son for noticing. But these modern-day scenes are mainly just framing devices. Most of the film takes place in the past. Young Edward is shown befriending a giant (Matthew McGrory) falling in love and joining a circus run by a miserly ringmaster (Danny DeVito). The movie is arranged into episodes. In one Edward as a boy meets a witch (Helena Bonham Carter) with a magical glass eye. In another he comes upon a town in which grass grows in the street and everyone is barefoot and happy. As is usually the case with Burton films the visuals are meticulously realized and that in itself is a kind of treat. The colors are vivid and saturated from the reds and earth tones of the circus world to the unreal blue of the sky. In just one example of felicitous camera placement Burton films a cat jumping from a great height onto a cushion from beneath the cushion. Yet for all the precision of Burtons craft and the lushness of the visuals something about ""Big Fish"" remains arid and austere. The usual grotesque Burton touches dont sit well Computer-generated conjoined twins that look like a two-headed monster; a childbirth scene in which a newborn shoots from the womb and skids along a hospital floor. ""Big Fish"" strives for cuteness and for wisdom and tries to assure us that were seeing something profound. But its an emotionally stunted film about an emotionally stunted man. -- Advisory This film contains a fight scene and some images of nudity.

"Not Much Lure in This Big Fish washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Not Much Lure in This Big Fish Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 26 2003 THERE MAY be good things to say about Tim Burtons ""Big Fish"" but not too many will come from this corner. What is meant to be a wondrous tale a big-fish story that evokes the spirit of ""Forrest Gump"" and displays Burtons surrealistic imagery and set design is a disappointingly dull thud of a fantasy. The best thing in the movie which screenwriter John August adapted from Daniel Wallaces novel ""Big Fish A Story of Mythic Proportions"" is Albert Finney. As central character Edward Bloom he has an engaging swagger. And for an Englishman he packs one heck of a Southern accent. Unfortunately his presence isnt enough to carry such a narratively unwieldy film. Edward is a weaver of fanciful tales that captivate people but he never stops telling them and seems to be unable or unwilling to face reality. His son Will (Billy Crudup) has such resentment for his fathers outlandish stories he has become gasp a journalist a purveyor of boring facts and truth. And even worse he has left his small town in Alabama for . . . France. But Wills mother Sandra (Jessica Lange) summons the prodigal son home. It seems his father is dying and the time has come for some kind of reconciliation. Will wants to understand his fathers real life story get to the bottom of things. But Edward -- and clearly this movie -- insists that the truth is what you want to believe about yourself. As one of the narrators Will reprises the zany episodes in Edwards life that the old man has always claimed to be true. And with Ewan McGregor playing the young Edward we experience those adventures as real events. They include a visit to the fantastical ""Brigadoon""-like small town called Specter where people walk barefoot through grass; Edwards lifelong romantic pursuit of Sandra (played as a younger woman by Alison Lohman); encounters with an array of assorted characters including a giant (Matthew McGrory) a witch (Helena Bonham Carter) whose glass eye sees into the dark future and a pair of conjoined twins; and Edwards attempt to catch a giant fish -- a regular presence in the movie. Will doesnt believe a word of any of this of course. And frankly its easy to understand why. Theres something terribly forced about everything as if creating dreamlike scenery weird-and-not-that-wonderful characters and a mediocre draggy (two hours) story line is all it takes to cast a spell. By the time we arrive at the movies rather heavy-handed finale its only the larger-than-life force of Finneys acting that saves the scene. In the ultimate scheme of things that adds up to a minnows worth of magic. BIG FISH (PG-13 119 minutes) -- Contains some passing nudity and a little violence. Area theaters.

"Nothing Frying in Big Fish washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Nothing Frying in Big Fish Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday December 25 2003 ""Big Fish"" stinks from the head. A bit of leaden whimsy from Tim Burton this is almost certainly the years most pitiful specimen of major studio release from major director. You can only smack your hand against your head and wonder What were they thinking? Basically an exercise in Old South mythologizing it takes as its major text the awkwardness between fathers and sons and as its subtext the southern love of embellished narrative. These two themes it lamely tries to spin for two long and charmless hours somewhat like ""Forrest Gump"" on a high colonic. It boasts three big stars -- Albert Finney Ewan McGregor and Jessica Lange -- who have all been better. The best thing in the picture is a young up-and-comer even if the picture hes in seems different than the one theyre in. Thats Billy Crudup as Will Bloom a young newspaper reporter in Paris who returns home when he learns his father is dying of cancer. The two havent really spoken in two years. Thats because Big Ed Bloom (Finney) is a tale-teller. Its the view of the movie that Ol Ed is a big lovable bear of a man and that in the whimsical tales he tells can be seen all manner of delight and wisdom. Its the view of this reviewer that Big Ed is a pathological liar ensnared in an ugly mesh of bitter hostility who cannot stand to have attention paid to anyone other than himself and so he happily destroys every social situation hes in -- the big one was his sons wedding -- by telling his charmin tales and relentlessly hogging the spotlight. He doesnt need a hug he needs a poke in the snout. In any event Will heads back to Alabama where his father lies abed in hopes of coming to some sort of truth about the man. Thus the narrative structure of the movie which is Big Ed spinning yarns dodging the truth flirting furiously with every damn woman he meets while his understanding wife (Lange) his adoring daughter-in-law (Marion Cotillard) and his simmering son stand by. This might work if the stories themselves had any charm whatsoever but of course they dont. They seem to take place in a world of magical realism occupied by a giant (George McArthur) and a witch (Helena Bonham Carter) and mysterious Brigadoon-like towns in the swamps. The work of Diane Arbus may have been part of the visual inspiration for Burtons design of this place -- the giant recalls one of her famous photos and another image shows two twins in plaid similar to a famous Arbus composition -- but it all adds up pretty much to nothing. At least the makers of ""Forrest Gump"" had the smarts to put Forrest in historically significant moments in baby boomer history as they charted his course through the years; Burton puts young Ed nowhere except in a dimly imagined world thats about on a level with Burtons ""Pee-wees Big Adventure."" The young Ed is played by McGregor in that same breezy callow style that he brought to the breezy callow ""Down With Love."" Nobody in the movie however with the exception of Crudup is real. The movie itself isnt real. But its real flaw -- this turns it into an ordeal -- is the almost total lack of suspense. Nothing is ever at stake; theres no reason to go on watching; no audience expectation is met. Its more like random scenes from life than it is a coherently imagined story. Big Fish (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for a fight scene and sexual innuendo.

Like its title metaphor its a shimmering fish that darts away from capture dancing in and out of a waiting pair of hands in some sparkling river -- a slippery never-quite-reachable prize. You keep waiting for the movie to settle down and find its pace; it never quite does but the efforts always watchable. At its heart ""Big Fish"" is a story about storytelling; about a fathers need to spin his life story into a colorful tale to be hero of his own narrative. Albert Finney puffy and garrulously charming plays Edward Bloom an elderly man who at the end of his life is seeking closure with his estranged son Will (Billy Crudup). The two men see life rather differently complains Edward -- if Will were to tell his fathers life story hed give ""all of the facts none of the flavor."" As Will reluctantly sits at his fathers bedside encouraged by his mother Sandra (Jessica Lange) Edward weaves the threads of his autobiography with flavor to spare. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Big Fish"" with Albert Finney Ewan McGregor Billy Crudup Jessica Lange Helena Bonham Carter Alison Lohman. Directed by Tim Burton from a screenplay by John August based on the novel by Daniel Wallace. 120 minutes. Rated PG-13 for a fight scene some images of nudity and a suggestive reference. Several theaters. And its quite a tale -- beginning with skidding down a hospital hallway as a too-slick infant continuing with stories of witches ghost towns circuses idealized young love a wistful giant and a pair of conjoined twins who sing at a USO show and ending ... well ""its a surprise ending"" Ed tells his son. ""Wouldnt want to ruin it for you."" Fair enough. Burtons fabled imagination runs wild with this material and ""Big Fish"" often achieves a whimsical poetic beauty. In his travels Ed (played as a young man by Ewan McGregor) arrives at a ghost town named Spectre all emerald-green grass and perfectly whitewashed storefronts where nobody wears shoes; their footwear dangles jauntily overhead on a wire as the inhabitants pale feet glide through the velvet of the lawn. At the circus presided over by Danny DeVito as a devilish ringmaster in red Ed finds work and meets the love of his life Sandra (played in the flashback scenes by Alison Lohman who looks exactly like a soft-focus Jessica Lange). When he sees her the moment freezes with popcorn hanging in the air like snowflakes -- hes in love in that irresistibly heartachy movie way and he sets out to win her. Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (an Oscar winner for ""A River Runs Through It"") gives these scenes a slightly bleached-out quality; a fantasy pallor as Ed stands in a canary-yellow sea of daffodils and pleads for Sandras love. Its gorgeous even when he gets punched in the face by Sandras current boyfriend -- he lies among the daffodils and grins a toothy bloody smile. ""Big Fish"" has the meandering quality that many yarns do; John Augusts screenplay seems more like a series of anecdotes than a fully realized drama.

The imaginatively illustrated but precariously precious film offers up a string of minor pleasures but never becomes more than moderately amusing or involving. A correction was made to this article on Dec. 2 2003. In a personable return to more civilized terrain after his disagreeable visit to the ""Planet of the Apes"" Tim Burton still doesnt entirely find his footing in the whimsical ""Big Fish."" Adapted from Daniel Wallaces popular novel about a man who has made himself bigger than life through the tall tales hes spun about himself the imaginatively illustrated but precariously precious film offers up a string of minor pleasures but never becomes more than moderately amusing or involving. Pics intimate personal feel will appeal to ardent Burton fans as well as to some critics whose support will be vital in nudging this Sony release even to midlevel commercial success. Using as its focus a gregarious Southern gent known far and wide for his self-referential outsized yarns ""Big Fish"" forwards the notion that a storyteller becomes important and beloved if not immortal for the very stories he tells not for the mundane facts of his life. This idea would clearly hold special attraction for a director like Burton whose bent has always been for the fantastic rather than the everyday. But then almost every imaginative creator would subscribe to this view of the artists privileged position in the scheme of things which is at once romantic true and self-aggrandizing and can excuse all manner of behavior. In the case of Ed Bloom his myth-making has been happily embraced by one and all except for his son Will (Billy Crudup) whos heard all the stories a million times and felt compelled to escape to Paris and obviously in rebellion to work as a journalist to get away from the oppressive weight of his self-centered dad. But when the old man (Albert Finney) takes ill his son who hasnt spoken with him in a long time returns to Alabama with pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) with one ambition in mind ""I just want know the true versions of events of stories of things."" Good luck. Script by John August (""Go"" ""Charlies Angels"") dexterously jumps among time frames dating from the 30s to the present day characters at different ages and points of view. In an alluring early scene Bloom and his boyhood friends look into a local witchs eye to learn how theyre going to die. Bloom uniquely keeps the vision confidential but is so buoyed by what he sees that it gives him the confidence to take on any challenge in life head-on and without fear. And so in his own mind at least Bloom becomes too big a fish to be confined to little Ashton Ala. After taming a cave-dwelling ""monster"" thats been terrorizing the town Bloom (played in youth by Ewan McGregor) hits the road with said giant Karl (Guinness Book of Records-sized thesp Matthew McGrory) to see the world only to be quickly sidetracked by a visit to a hidden-away time-stands-still burg called Spectre where the residents frolic barefoot on grass streets and where Bloom is invited to stay forever. Instead he moves on finding work with Karl in a traveling circus presided over by the quick-talking Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito). This huckster manages to string Bloom along for three years by doling out tiny clues about the identity of the young lady Bloom has only briefly seen at the circus but who hes convinced is the love of his life. Blooms eventual courtship of Sandra (Alison Lohman) reps one of the films sweet delights although this is quickly interrupted by his Army service in Asia the highlight of which is his discovery and promotion of a unique performing duo Siamese twins Ping and Jing (twins Ada and Arlene Tai amazingly forged into one two-legged unit via special effects). All this is related for the umpteenth time by the bedridden Bloom to Will who angrily denounces his father as a fake for making a fiction of his life. ""Ive been no one but myself since the day I was born"" Bloom replies ""and if you cant see that its your failing and not mine."" Duly chastened Will listens some more to tales about how his dad was dragooned into a bank robbery and returned to Spectre to raise the hamlet from ruins and put its remaining citizens back on their feet. Will also has a long chat with an attractive local misfit (Helena Bonham Carter who previous popped up as the Witch) with whom hes convinced his father had an affair but the woman tells him an unexpected story that is crucially revelatory of the man. The episodic nature of the film causes a mild case of shifting in your seat and like a long tale told orally it rises and falls by the moment depending upon the interest generated by the storys details and the ability of the storyteller to bring them alive. Mostly the anecdotes are distracting and nimbly related. But there are few genuinely dramatic situations and very seldom is there a sense of urgency meaning that the film basically hops skips and jumps along under sunny skies with little change of mood. As Blooms life and the film near the end it also becomes apparent that a significant hole lies at the center of the tale. Much of the action stresses the mans lifelong love for Sandra who for her part also seems as much in love with her mate of 40 years as she did when they married. But aside from a nice bathtub scene there is far too little interaction between the old Bloom and Sandra (played in her maturity by Jessica Lange) as the latter is mostly forced to stand by looking supportive and/or concerned while her son struggles to break through the emotional breach with dad. The conclusion which finally reveals Blooms childhood vision of his own death is elating and reasonably moving but it might have been much more so had a scene or two been devoted to clinching the viewers feeling for this unusually devoted couple. The very well-cast thesps mostly come through with flavorsome work. Crucially in a film that cuts between different actors playing the same roles at different ages the physical matchups are outstanding both between McGregor and Finney and Lohman and Lange. Sedentary most of the time Finney brings genuine warmth to the old mythomaniac without any servings of ham and his way with words makes his tales delectable. As the young Bloom McGregor is enthusiastic almost to a fault a bit thickly laying on the bright smile and winning ways while still resembling his debonair 50s playboy from ""Down With Love."" In a largely reactive role Lohman has some sweet moments while Bonham Carter does very well with her long confessional scene as a lonely older woman. Crudup bears up as best he can with the straight-man role August invented for the film while DeVito and Steve Buscemi the latter as a slippery poet-turned-robber-turned financier sock over their extended cameos. Per the norm with Burtons films craft aspects are superlative beginning with Dennis Gassners exceptionally varied production design and Colleen Atwoods equally diverse costumes and including Philippe Rousselots sensitively modulated lensing Danny Elfmans supple score and the many imaginative special effects among them a literal rendering of the imposing title creature.

But that reckons without the strength of the characters Andre Dubus III created for his novel or the detailed care with which writer-director Perelman has brought them to the screen in his first feature. The minute we meet them all (including Iranian actress Aghdashloo who is great as the colonels timorous sweet-souled wife) we sense that were in the presence of darkly fated lives. Connellys Kathy may be flaked out but she has the kind of self-destructive strength such people can muster when they are fighting for the shreds of their history their last hope of respectability. Kingsleys work as the colonel is simply astonishing just possibly the performance of the year. Hes a prissy legalistic sort of man who feels that his hope of claiming a corner of the American Dream is being savaged by a crazy lady. And his growing rage made the more terrible by his effort to control it is harrowing to behold. As reversible misunderstandings grow into irreversible tragedy it slowly dawns on you that this is a superior heartbreaking film. --By Richard Schickel STUCK ON YOU Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly Starring Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear On those rare occasions when you think about them you do kind of wonder how Siamese (or to use the more p.c. word ""conjoined"") twins manage the more intimate aspects of life -- having sex going to the bathroom rolling over in bed. Quite nicely according to the Farrelly brothers. A little too nicely for fans of their raucously transgressive films such as Theres Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber. In Stuck on You the Farrellys have twinned those likable actors Damon and Kinnear -- the former playing Bob the shy anxious sibling; the latter playing Walt a more outgoing type -- and the best material in the film is about their goofy adeptness in sports and work. But then the plot sends them from humble Marthas Vineyard to glamorous Hollywood because Walt wants to be of all things an actor. This isnt a bad idea and theres some fun stuff as he finds unlikely success hobnobbing with Meryl Streep and co-starring with Cher. But Bob falls in love which makes him simpy; success dulls Walts edge; and when they have an operation to separate themselves they discover that they needed each other more than they knew. At this point the picture starts administering glucose injections into Americas already sugar-laden bloodstream. The Farrellys need to remember this Sappiness is easy comedy is hard. --R.S. MONA LISA SMILE Directed by Mike Newell Starring Julia Roberts Kirsten Dunst Maggie Gyllenhaal Can a school sue for libel? Wellesley College might have a case against this well-intentioned weepie set at the Seven Sisters school 50 years ago (and partly shot there last fall). To judge from the Lawrence Konner -- Mark Rosenthal script Wellesley bred its bright students to be overachievers in the kitchen not the workplace and it attracted snoots and rich brats whod haze a new teacher with their contempt -- even if that teacher was Roberts. Roberts (whos pretty good in an impossibly saintly role) is Katherine a Berkeley grad who was hired as an art instructor but teaches the girls How to Live. Shes the paragon of wit grit and liberality. Everyone else is a mess. The teachers have guilty secrets that the viewer will deduce long before they are revealed. The students -- bigoted or spiteful or weak -- must have their minds shaped and bent by Katherine then confess their sins to the world. Her technique personal liberation through public humiliation. With Katherines lectures on the dead-artists society the movie seems to tout rebellious originality. In fact its a lesson in emotional conformity. Each character is given a single trait to pursue into caricature Dunsts icy schemer Gyllenhaals neurotic man chaser Julia Stiles timid intellectual. Actors rolled eyes grimaces and fretful pouts quickly cue viewers to the stereotypes. And every 15 minutes we get what the film thinks is its money shot Roberts smile. Maybe Wellesley isnt the only injured party here. Can an audience sue for cruel and edifying punishment? --R.C. BIG FISH Directed by Tim Burton Starring Ewan McGregor Albert Finney Billy Crudup Boy did we want to love this one Burton master fabulist filming a script by John August (he wrote the zesty ensemble comedy Go) adapted from Daniel Wallaces much cherished novel. Dreamboat du jour McGregor heading an attractive cast. Magic realism rampant on a bed of family angst. Should work. Doesnt though. You recall the boy who cried wolf? Edward Bloom (Finney) is the man who cried fish. He loves telling stories of his wondrous adventures as a young man (in which he is played by McGregor). But to his son (Crudup) the tales just smell fishy. Will the two men reconcile on Dads deathbed? Could Edwards lies be true?

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Ewan McGregor and Hailey Anne Nelson in Tim Burtons Big Fish. By Zade Rosenthal Columbia Pictures Lets not minimize the last point. If you do not know the name of production designer Dennis Gassner the time is now to make his acquaintance. To gauge the degree of visual spell this movie casts think about just a few of Gassners past credits Field of Dreams Barton Fink The Truman Show and Road to Perdition. Fishs storybook look serves instead of overwhelms the fantastically episodic life of a protagonist played in seamless harmony by Ewan McGregor (as a young man) and Finney (the older dying version). To hear this loyal husband tell it (and tell it and tell it) hes the kind of guy other people gravitate toward. But his estranged journalist son (Billy Crudup) is weary of a life spent listening to Dads marathon whoppers at inopportune times (such as prom nights and wedding receptions). This attitude will change whether he believes the stories or not. Theres a natural tendency to compare McGregor-Finneys Edward Bloom character to Forrest Gump but Gump was a passive individual one who had great historical events thrust upon him. Bloom is the kind of guy who creates his own history. If he has to shovel manure in a circus for months just to learn the name of the woman he knows at once he loves (Alison Lohman) he will. If he has to buy every house in a community one by one to revitalize it he will. If it suddenly makes sense for this straight arrow to participate in a bank robbery so be it. Forty years ago Finney was the handsome lead in Tom Jones a few months away from its best-picture Oscar. Now hes an unmade bed who spends most of this movie in bed. But hes also a beloved character actor whose presence in any movie brings a smile. Equally delightful is the Lohman characters evolution into an older woman (Jessica Lange). Its a metamorphosis to equal any in screen history. Big Fish takes a while to get its bearings but it gets better and better. Steve Buscemi and Helena Bonham Carter show up and the story works its way to a finale that can make grown men sniffle. The picture expands on Dec. 25 but doesnt go wide until January which makes sense in terms of Oscar campaigning. Its too bad the picture isnt everywhere for the holiday season because this is the best family movie around -- one easily good enough to do a Jaws number on a bleeder like Elf.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.
