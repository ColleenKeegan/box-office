A career hit man finds himself the target in ""Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang)"" a stylish genre hodgepodge in which lethal violence and acceptably limned sentimentality cohabit with varying degrees of success. Contempo London-set pic has a fetching 60s retro feel but is defiantly uneven in its plotting relying too much on generic notions of family ties and generalizations about beauty to be found in an ugly world. In rendering semi-sordid proceedings light rather than lugubrious the excellent jazzy and choral score by composer John Dankworth cannot be over-estimated. When Felix (Stellan Skarsgard) decides to go legit after 25 years of shooting people his colleagues set out to kill him. While dodging bullets Felix must deal with his wry pregnant girlfriend; his wry ailing dad; and Bubba (Chris Penn) the 33-year-old only son of a gangster who never let his beloved boy out of the house. Gripping opening chase and murder in a public swimming pool is jauntily lensed. However once Felix announces his retirement and accepts the job of baby-sitting for pudgy naive Bubba pic leans more on style than substance to hang together. Production design is snappy acting earnest.

"Kiss of the Dragon | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Kiss of the Dragon Joe Leydon Film Critic joeleydon 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr July 5 2001 | 1249PM PT Boldly kicking ass like no ass has been kicked before ""Kiss of the Dragon"" is a slick straight-ahead action-thriller that marks a small step back and two bounding leaps forward for toplined Jet Li. Boldly kicking ass like no ass has been kicked before ""Kiss of the Dragon"" is a slick straight-ahead action-thriller that marks a small step back and two bounding leaps forward for toplined Jet Li. Pic overall seems rather conventional even retrograde when compared to the genre-scrambling crossover-appealing ""Romeo Must Die"" Lis only previous English-lingo star vehicle. But ""Dragon"" is more consistently exciting as a rock-the-house shoot-the-works adventure opus loaded with fight scenes that rank with the classic rough stuff of ""Enter the Dragon"" ""The Legend of Drunken Master"" and Lis own ""Fist of Legend."" Just as important the French-U.S. co-production underscores Lis increasing ease and confidence working in English which likely will enhance pics appeal to mainstream domestic auds. Foreign sales and homevid biz should be super. Co-produced and co-written (with ""The Fifth Element"" collaborator Robert Mark Kamen) by Luc Besson ""Dragon"" is every bit as custom-tailored as you would expect of a project based on an original story by its star. Li plays Liu Juan a crack Chinese government agent whos sent on his first trip to France as an assistant to Paris undercover cops. Hard-boiled flic Jean-Pierre Richard (Tcheky Karyo) head of a police surveillance team graciously greets Liu as a comrade in arms while the team keeps tabs on Chinese drug smugglers in a deluxe Paris hotel. Indeed Richard even coins a nickname -- Johnny -- for his Chinese associate. In no time at all however Richard reveals his true colors when he arranges for a drug-addled hooker to slay the chief Chinese malefactor. Worse he frames ""Johnny"" for the crime then tries to permanently silence the Chinese agent. Murder attempt leads to the first razzle-dazzle sequence of hand-to-hand combat. Neophyte helmer Chris Nahon and vet action director Cory Yuen emphasize old-fashioned street-fighting ferocity not high-tech computer-improved balletics. As a result pic should greatly please purists who want their kung-foolishness served straight up -- i.e. without wire work -- in traditionally two-fisted fleet-footed fashion. Liu manages to incapacitate or exterminate anyone who blocks his exit route from the hotel. Once on the mean streets of Paris however our hero is a stranger in a strange land unable to trust anyone but Uncle Tai (Burt Kwouk) his initial Paris contact. To prove his innocence he requires the corroborating testimony of an innocent bystander at the murder scene Jessica (Bridget Fonda) another dope-addicted prostitute -- from North Dakota no less -- controlled by Richard. Fortuitously Jessica just happens to ply her trade in front of the food store operated by Uncle Tai. Unfortunately shes exceedingly reluctant to help Liu. Despite some disorienting fuzziness during pics opening minutes the plot is perfectly adequate to bridge the gaps between the spectacular fight scenes which appear almost as frequently as production numbers in ""Singin in the Rain."" At least two of the show-stopping interludes -- a battle royal aboard a tourist boat a free-for-all inside Uncle Tais shop -- are so masterfully sensational they elicited spontaneous applause during at least one preview screening. But the real piece de resistance is the terrifically sustained climax which has Liu -- armed only with his wits his kung-fu process and a cache of acupuncture needles -- doing more damage to the occupants of a police station than anyone since Arnold Schwarzenegger announced he would be back in ""The Terminator."" Our hero simply strolls into the building takes on what appears to be half the cops in greater metropolitan Paris and ultimately goes one-on-one with the dastardly Richard. Hugely satisfying finale provides explanation for the title. Jet Li is so fast and furious that even when he demolishes an entire roomful of karate-trained cops its ridiculously easy to suspend disbelief and go with the flow. Fondas performance is too far over the top but she isnt on screen long enough to do serious damage. First-rate production values include Marco Caves razor-sharp editing and Craig Armstrongs aptly punctuating musical score. Movie buffs may be amused by casting of Karyo who was the heroines trainer in producer Bessons ""La Femme Nikita"" and Fonda who played the heroine in latter pics Americanized remake ""Point of No Return."" Also worth noting is presence of Burt Kwouk looking far more dignified and world-weary than he did when he served as sparring partner for Peter Sellers in the ""Pink Panther"" movies. Which of course makes one wonder what Inspector Clouseau would have ever made of Liu Juan.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Kiss of the Dragon Ouch La La By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 6 2001 Jet Li shows no merci in ""Kiss of the Dragon."" (P. Camboulive/Fox) Someone who counted informs me that Jet Li kills 81 guys in ""Kiss of the Dragon"" assuming that all those spinning head kicks and flying dragon punches are lethal. Moreover he tends to dispatch his opponents in clusters once even massacring an entire dojoful of French special policemen in their martial-arts outfits.But without context of what value is such information? Is this a lot of victims by Jet Li standards? Or is it rather modest? I have no idea. And when Jet dispatches a particularly loathsome villain by pronging him with chopsticks in the throat are we to be glad that he chose not to go through the eyes the ears or the nostrils? Does he usually go for eyes when he kills with chopsticks? Again without a PhD in Jetology from the University of Hong Kong who can speak authoritatively?What can be said is only this ""Kiss of the Dragon"" offers just about a kill a minute but less than a thrill a minute.Despite its heros athleticism (considerable) and speed (blinding) the movie isnt near special. Its just the usual martial-arts stuff an incomprehensible plot a villain so sure hes going to win an Oscar he eats not only the scenery of this movie but of the next three or four as well a simpering weepy American prostitute from North Dakota and lots of whacks thwacks and smacks.The plot is a feeble pretext for 90 minutes in punch city. Li a Chinese policeman is sent to coordinate with French police who are investigating a Chinese drug dealer. However hes really being set up by the corrupt officer in charge who wants the mild-looking Jet to take the fall for killing the gangster a competitor to the cops growing crime empire.Naturally Jet escapes; naturally he is chased; naturally many fights ensue.There are a few distinguishing features in all the blurring of motive and accent. The Frenchman in the villains role is Tcheky Karyo - think Harvey Keitel high on escargot - who overacts so aggressively you worry for his health. An embolism threatens to bring him down at any moment. Then theres Bridget Fonda as the weepy prostitute he has blackmailed into street duty with whom Jet bonds whose daughter he saves whose bra peeks through her half-buttoned blouse the entire movie long. Really Bridget Fonda dressed like an extra in ""Irma la Douce."" IncroyableThe flaw in the film - well other than the film itself - is Lis lack of charisma. He is a great fighter but when he is not kicking le posterieur of various French toads hes not registering. He doesnt have Jackie Chans comic self-awareness or Bruce Lees intensity or Chow Yun-Fats beauty. He just looks a little baffled.I will say that the movie improves radically in its last few minutes when Jet attacks an entire French police station. That gets him through the martial-arts class one by one two by one even six by one a very neat scene in which he demonstrates incredible hand speed; a nice one-on-two against two blond giants who appear to be almost but not quite as fast as he is; and a final confrontation with M. Karyos overwrought acting style where he does conjure up a most delicious cool righteous death.But - and I speak as a man kicked out of the Ritz for not being cool enough - I most admired an earlier sequence in which somebody pulls two Uzis and hoses the holy interior decoration out of the lobby of a Paris four-star hotel of exactly the sort that I was asked to leave. I like that in a movie. ""Kiss of the Dragon"" (R 120 minutes) - Contains strong violence language some sexuality and drug content. Area theaters.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings A Fist Full of Frenchmen By Mark Jenkins Special to The Washington Post Friday July 6 2001 Jet Li shows no merci in ""Kiss of the Dragon."" (P. Camboulive/Fox) A diminutive but formidable Chinese cop arrives in a foreign land; he doesnt understand the culture but hes prepared to outmaneuver any antagonist. It sounds like the premise for a dozen Jackie Chan flicks but ""Kiss of the Dragon"" actually features Jet Li who is easily Chans equal at kung fu but doesnt share Chans comic flair. Li punches kicks and twirls without cracking a smile and so does this movie. ""Kiss of the Dragon"" does have a sense of its own absurdity but that doesnt prevent it from cloaking the inherently comic kung-fu genre in a seriousness so solemn that it could be French. In fact it is. ""Romeo Must Die"" star Li conceived the story and took it to Luc Besson who wrote the script with Hollywood screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen who worked on ""Karate Kids"" 1 and 2 as well as Bessons ""The Fifth Element."" Parisian TV-commercial maker Chris Nahon directed yielding a French film with a Hong Kong star and English-language dialogue.The action commences when Jiuan (Li) arrives in Paris. A crack Beijing police operative Jiuan has been summoned to stop a Chinese heroin smuggler. Jiuan is soon introduced to French Police Inspector Richard (Besson regular Tcheky Karyo) who swaggers a little too ominously to be a good guy. Sure enough Richard is involved in the drug trade - among other rackets - and plans to eliminate the dealer and frame Jiuan for the murder. Richard accomplishes much of his plan but the Chinese cop makes a spectacular getaway juggling a grenade as he escapes down a laundry chute. Jiuan cant prove he didnt kill the dealer however unless he recovers a surveillance videotape or tracks down one of the witnesses junkie hooker Jessica (Bridget Fonda).The movie offers the basic tour of Paris landmarks from the Eiffel Tower to Sacre Coeur to Place de la Concorde but compresses Chinatown and Pigalles red light district into one coexistent block. So its only logical that Jessica should turn up outside the shrimp-cracker factory where Jiuan is hiding trolling for clients while the Chinese cop ponders his next move. Jiuan doesnt immediately recognize her but once he makes the connection the two start working together. A formerly innocent farm girl from North Dakota Jessicas in thrall to Richard because the dirty inspectors holding her young daughter hostage. Naturally Jiuan agrees to add rescuing the little girl to his agenda along with clearing his own name and personally bludgeoning roughly half of Pariss police force.The movie acknowledges that the Chinese avengers quest is somewhat droll notably in a scene where he bursts through a door inside a police station only to encounter a martial-arts classroom full of strapping Gallic cops outfitted with batons. Yet ""Kiss of the Dragon"" undercuts the humor and grace of the fight scenes - superbly choreographed by longtime Li collaborator Corey Yuan - with raw brutality thats uncharacteristic of Hong Kong cinema. Jiuans secret weapon is a selection of acupuncture needles that can quietly incapacitate an opponent. When not employing the needles however Jiuan is searing attackers faces with hot irons or jamming chopsticks deep into a mans throat. Richard is introduced while beating a mans face to a pulp and a minor character is literally blown in half.""Kiss of the Dragon"" is in part a post-colonial fantasy of French ruthlessness in the tradition of such bloody Besson romps as ""La Femme Nikita"" and ""The Professional."" But it also functions as a revenge fantasy for anyone whos ever been snubbed by a Parisian waiter or shopkeeper. Not only does the Chinese superman defeat beefy blond Frenchmen by the score he topples several of them with the French tricolor itself. The result isnt as elegant as the 50s and 60s Jean-Pierre Melville films that inspired John Woo but it does have energy style and some wit.Too bad the filmmakers - and heres where the American part comes in - decided the movie had to have some heart too. This aspect is embodied by the simpering strung-out but maternal Jessica a part that is both badly played and essentially unplayable. Ironically Fonda was the murderous agent in ""Point of No Return"" the U.S. remake of ""La Femme Nikita."" That role was ridiculous too but at least she got to shoot people.

In ""Kiss of the Dragon Jet Li plays a Chinese government agent who is double-crossed in Paris; Bridget Fonda portrays a hooker who needs his help. A knockout punch / Martial arts master Jet Li finally gets the English-language picture he deserves 1 / 1 Back to Gallery KISS OF THE DRAGON Action thriller. Starring Jet Li. Featuring Bridget Fonda and Tcheky Karyo. Produced by Luc Besson. Directed by Chris Nahon. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It took some doing. Finally Jet Li the greatest action star in movies today has an English-language film that shows him off to good -- and surprising -- advantage even if he had to go to France to do it. A violent dark and luridly melodramatic thriller called ""Kiss of the Dragon"" it is almost the anti-""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" It is not merely a thriller but a shocker. It will separate hard-core Jet Li followers from the fair-weather fans. Li is serious about the R rating. On his Web site he even says he does not want parents to let young children see this film. His next one will be PG-13 to restore the balance. ""Kiss of the Dragon"" bears the stamp of producer Luc Besson turbo-powered director of ""The Professional"" and ""The Fifth Element"" although he did not direct this one. A young French video and TV commercial director Chris Nahon did. Besson wrote the script and put the wildly disparate elements together very rough edges and all. Some people hate his overheated films and their extravagant emotions. I like them very much. In ""Kiss of the Dragon"" Besson gets it. Not only does he understand the source of his international stars enormous appeal but he also understands that Li possesses a quality after all is said and done no other action star does Gentleness. Li seems to function in a cone of inner calm. He plays an agent of the Chinese government in Paris double-crossed and stranded in a city that may be a tourist trap for others but is a death trap for him. A two-faced villain is played in your face Besson style by Tcheky Karyo a Turkish-born actor who has made his career in France. One of his two faces is a suave diplomat and the other is an absolute loony. Even if Karyo goes over the top Bridget Fonda has the most problematic role. She is as she puts it ""an ex-junkie hooker who can cook clean sew and likes Chinese food."" Notice the dry sense of humor too Shes talking about sewing up Lis wounds. ""Kiss of the Dragon"" begins spy-movie style with Li approaching the desk of a posh hotel and inquiring if there are any messages ""for Mr. Smith."" Soon the first of several extended-action set pieces will begin. It takes place in a suite set up for an assignation with two prostitutes one of them faux ""Oriental"" with chopsticks in her wig and a dragon tattoo on her back. The other is Fonda. There are hidden cameras all over the place. People who set up hidden cameras like presidents who set up tape recorders should be careful. They may catch more than they bargained for. Next Li is escaping like a cat burglar with a videocassette of a killing. There will be an explosive chase in a laundry chute. In another action sequence Li starts out in the dining room of a riverboat on the Seine jumps to a bridge and shoots through a tunnel and into the sewer before exiting into the Paris Metro. There will be a one-armed fight in a Chinese shop where chopsticks (again) are put to unusual use; a clattering fight between a gymnasium full of ominous martial arts students in white and Li in black; and attacks by two tall blond henchmen who look like twins -- one takes up where the other leaves off. The encounter with the twins is one of the few that use the kind of ""wire work"" made famous by Hong Kong fight master Yuen Wo-Ping in ""The Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" Li has by and large avoided wire use in this film in favor of unadulterated martial arts action. Li did not just come like a jet out of the blue. He is the real thing a genuine martial arts champion of China and the star of more than two dozen Hong Kong films at least several of them classics of the genre ""Fists of Legend"" ""Once Upon a Time in China"" and ""Shaolin Temple"" among them. He is in the unique position of having been offered and for personal reasons turned down roles in ""Crouching Tiger"" and the two ""Matrix"" sequels. Instead he has done ""The One"" an action fantasy co-starring Carla Gugino (""Spy Kids"") that spans three lifetimes in different eras of the two characters. It will be released next. His English-language films so far have included a brief brilliant guest role as the villain in Mel Gibsons ""Lethal Weapon 4"" and the mixed results of ""Romeo Must Die"" which brings up the unavoidable issue of his small stature. He does not have the presence of a romantic lead. In ""Kiss of the Dragon"" Li plays an agent with ""no wife no children and devoted only to work."" When Fonda materializes he tries to remain a loner but discovers they have a history. To its credit this film thumbs its nose at the ""problem"" of his height by pairing him with Fonda who is distinctly taller and then putting her in spike heels that let her tower over him. Beautiful. The thing to keep in mind about Lis scenes with the prostitute a stock whore with a heart of gold is that they are not about her; they are about him and what they often reveal is his gentleness. Elsewhere he can be ferocious. Li wears a wristband from which he plucks acupuncture needles. They can be used for good or ill. In the most horrifying death of all Li doesnt even strike a blow. He merely describes to his victim the terrible things that are going to happen to him and lets him think about them for a while. Advisory Contains graphic violence and explicit sex.

USATODAY.com - Jet-powered Kiss mostly a miss Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 07/05/2001 - Updated 0330 PM ET Jet-powered Kiss mostly a miss By Mike Clark USA TODAY Kiss of the Dragon (out of four) Stars Jet Li Bridget Fonda Tcheky Karyo Laurence Ashley Burt Kwouk Director Chris Nahon Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating R for strong violence language some sexual and drug content After seeing a Jackie Chan flick people walk out of the theater remarking how impish and twinkle-eyed the actor is how hes as lovable as a silent-film comedian. Then theres the Jet Li experience. Kiss of the Dragons Jet-stream assaults lack the gentle approach. Early in the film a baddie takes him on and the guys dismembered torso -- well enough said. Later Li tries to educate a thug on the finer points of using chopsticks by ramming them through his neck. Read more Video Kiss of the Dragon trailer This mayhem comes to pass because Lis Chinese government agent arrives in Paris to assist a French police official (The Patriots Tcheky Karyo) on a case. Outwardly smooth Lis new partner is an all-out madman about to commit an elaborate hotel assassination part of the scam he has devised in order to eventually play the hero and solve the crime. But before then he orders his henchmen to kill Li as well. This is when one of Karyos lieutenants gets severed at the navel and other hoods fare about as well. The movie has a simple structure Kill a few people talk a little kill a few more people. As a stranger in a strange city even a Jet Li needs a helper to provide a hideout or some general trouble-shooting. He gets two aged mentor Uncle Tai (Burt Kwouk once the aggressive Kato-the-houseboy in Peter Sellers great Inspector Clouseau comedies) and a junkie streetwalker played by Bridget Fonda. In real life Fonda has been linked romantically with Dwight Yoakam. Here in freaky makeup that seems extreme even for her role she looks as if she ought to be dating Dwight Frye the demented mainstay of horror classics from the original Dracula to Frankenstein. Karyos hired toughies are a sight as well -- a burly middle-ager who could pass for Mickey Spillanes double and a couple of behemoths sporting Dennis Rodman-like rinse jobs. In one scene Li enters a martial arts class to find about 30 kick/gouge specialists dressed in robes and ready to rumble. Guess who wins the skirmish? With a screenplay by La Femme Nikitas Luc Besson Kiss is less substantial but also less pretentious than Lis Romeo Must Die. Its an assortment of kicks somersaults and Dolby Digital bone-snaps interrupted by an infrequent story. Seeing this movie wont get you into MIT but its passable fun and all wrapped up in 95 minutes -- a mere smooch compared to a lot of movies these days.

Evoking the iconic Enter the Dragon and following the mad crossover success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon any mention of a winged serpent augurs particularly well. Kiss of the Dragon a serviceable strenuously hard-boiled contemporary caper set in a grimy amoral Paris of hookers punks and corrupt cops is nothing at all like Ang Lees romantic Oscarific success set in a traditional China of rituals and swordplay. But the two movies share a certain spirit of cultural globalization in the service of making American stars out of celebrated Chinese martial artists. With Kiss the spotlight swivels to Jet Li a fleet performer with a highly appealing demeanor of patient quizzical intelligence. Li made his American debut three years ago in Lethal Weapon 4 - he was the only effective weapon in the fight to keep the rusty Richard Donner franchise alive - but he was nearly speechless having not yet successfully kickboxed with En-glish. Li upped his mastery of the language last year in Romeo Must Die. But its only now speaking with fluency and precision that the compact handsome star gets to display the range of his capabilities both as a particularly balletic concise physical artist and as a persona The Li hero is trustworthy loyal dignified self-contained and so economical he can dispatch a roomful of adversaries without breaking a sweat much as Zhang Ziyi did while holding a cup of tea in Crouching Tiger. In Kiss of the Dragon (the exportable generic title relates arbitrarily to the heros wizardly expertise with acupuncture pins) the star plays Liu Jiuan a Chinese government agent who arrives in Paris on an assignment so top secret it takes a while to figure out how the game is to be played. Lius contact is Richard (The Patriots Tcheky Karyo) an explosive French police chief who stinks of sadism Richards sharky gray suit looks evil the geometrical stubble on his jaw looks evil and hes first seen pulping an already crumpled victim in that most sinister of tough-guy settings a hotel kitchen. Before long Richard has turned his psychopathic anger on Liu himself. And in the course of making sense of the baffling Parisian pickle in which he finds himself the Chinese visitor in the City of Light meets up with corn-fed Jessica (Bridget Fonda) a bruised young American woman stumbling through the ill-lit vice-ridden backstreets of Paree where Richard - an exceedingly busy bad cop - has hooked her on heroin forced her into prostitution and abducted her little daughter. Kiss of the Dragon is directed by Chris Nahon a French commercial filmmaker making his feature debut and the story is by Li himself. But the movies sensibilities belong above all to Luc Besson the compellingly brash Hollywood-besotted French director of La Femme Nikita The Fifth Element and The Professional. Besson produced Kiss and cowrote the script with Robert Mark Kamen and as with those previous productions hes high on the romance of the underbelly the lure of the American-style taciturn loner. Bessons Paris is a city of iconic settings turned sinister - a Metro station a tour boat on the Seine the Eiffel Tower. The inventive adversaries meanwhile are icons of a different sort terrifying white goons with bleached coifs an impossibly well-muscled black superman furious thugs with huge guns. (The nimble action choreography is by Cory Yuen who also worked with Li on Lethal Weapon 4.) This is all grimy guy-on-guy fun right down to the fevered bad-English dialogue. But theres one crucial fight Liu cant win and neither can Jet Li. ""My life is not some fairy tale My life is hell"" Jessica the unwilling streetwalker whines her eyes black-rimmed with misery and eye shadow. Shes a sad strung-out American girlie a female stock character of a familiar helpless sort and Fonda doesnt know what to do with her. Too wan to play her as a really desperate single mother too stiff to play her as a really unstrung skank the actress makes the faces and gestures of degradation without letting herself get dirty enough. This leaves Li to kick in the air by himself. Fortunately hes magnetic enough to take on Paris - and Hollywood - all by himself Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories HBO announces re-run premiere date for The Larry Sanders Show Stranger Things cast and fans scared with even Stranger prank HBO defends violent content as critics complain Nick Cannon says he was hit with Mariah Carey diss on Wild N Out True Detective not dead yet HBO insists Jimmy Fallon Snapchats Martha Stewarts cooking on The Tonight Show Game of Thrones HBO confirms season 8 will be last Photo Galleries 50Scoops50Days The Latest in Fall TV News The Biggest Moments From the 2016 Conventions Crazy Stupid Love Before They Were Stars The Most 2000s Fashion From John Tucker Must Die Exclusive Photos of The Walking Dead Season 7 27 Great Revenge Movies Alice in Wonderland Witticisms and Wisdom From the Disney Classic From Our Partners From Our Partners Contact UsCustomer ServiceAbout UsJobs at Time Inc.AdvertisePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAd ChoicesNewslettersSubscribeTerms of ServiceSite Map Copyright (c) 2016 Entertainment Weekly Inc.
