Whitmore IIGenre Comedy DramaRunning Time 117 minutes A sprawling contentious African-American clan gets together for the holidays at moms house -- and all but unravels on the way to discovering that the true meaning of Christmas is family. Delroy Lindo and Loretta Devine head a cast that plunges headlong into everything from catfights to line dances (including one of the latter that goes on waaay too long just before the credits). Mekhi Phifer hops out of his producers chair to don a Santa suit and play a fireman with an entirely understandable crush on Sharon Leal. And pop musics Chris Brown belts ""Try a Little Tenderness"" along with the title song -- a hip new holiday ditty -- to the rafters and beyond. The complications are often hokey the emotions generally overstated and the action sometimes slapsticky but theres heart at the films heart. And in a holiday picture thats what counts.

Secrets overflow when an extended African-American family reunites for the holidays. With Loretta Devine Delroy Lindo. Director Preston A. Whitmore 2nd (157). PG-13 Sexuality mild violence. At area theaters.Not sure youre quite ready for another holiday celebration? You could do a lot worse than sitting down to Christmas dinner with the Whitfields the sprawling family at the center of Preston A. Whitmore 2nds warm-hearted dramatic comedy.Granted there are skeletons rattling loudly in each closet of the California house where everyone reunites come December. Not that matriarch MaDere (Loretta Devine) wants to acknowledge any brewing trouble. Shed prefer to believe her kids are angels despite evidence quickly piling up to the contrary. Oldest son Quentin (Idris Elba) is dangerously in debt and on the run. Middle brother Claude (Columbus Short) is an AWOL soldier hiding a secret marriage. Teenage Baby (Chris Brown) wants to leave home and pursue his dreams of becoming a singer which would break MaDeres heart since her husband abandoned them all for his own music career. Meanwhile her daughters are busy juggling men of wide-ranging quality. Businesswoman Kelli (Sharon Leal) is pleasantly surprised when she meets a cute fireman (Mekhi Phifer) while Mel (Lauren London) is finally ready to submit her college boyfriend (Keith Robinson) to the high standards of her brothers. And oldest sister Lisa (Regina King) just found out her conniving husband (Laz Alonso) is cheating on her. As for MaDere shes got her hands full trying to balance her longtime relationship with Deacon Joe (Delroy Lindo) while keeping the peace among her boisterous brood. The plot lines are so carefully constructed that few feel real and one or two like the pair of buffoonish bookies on Quentins trail are laughably contrived. Still no matter how silly the situation each member of the uniformly strong cast creates a nice balance between sentimental and sweet - which is just how every holiday gathering should feel. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

PG  Article Continued BelowIf the real-life Christmas experience tends too often to be marred by the rude contradiction between expectations and reality (this is why the seasons a nightmare for alcoholics and depressives) movies like the ultra-bland holiday family movie This Christmas are at least partly to blame.Its set in a sparklingly affluent L.A. neighbourhood where everyones black beautiful and conspicuously loaded. Preston A. Whitmore IIs movie is about the annual holiday convergence of the Whitmore family an African-American clan so impossibly burdened by overdetermined melodramatic circumstance - like divorce infidelity intense sibling rivalry interracial marriage forbidden showbiz dreams and even real estate disputes - you keep expecting the whole thing to explode into at least a dozen TV pilots.While the movies sheer abundance of cranked-up personal crises stretches both credulity and running time (this is a long two hours) its also purely pro forma.You know as sure as youre settin there that everythings going to be all right in the end. For this is what this kind of inoffensively forgettable contentedly unambitious Christmas movie always has been always is and probably always will be about the absolute crushing of all familial disharmony beneath the sheer bulldozing weight of seasonal glad tidings.Its a nice message needless to say and should play nicely to those who like their Christmas movies like their Christmas meals bland stuffed and exactly the same year after year.

Comments This Christmas Recommended A Los Angeles matriarch (Loretta Devine) rejoices when her six grown children reunite for Christmas at last even if this means her longtime live-in boyfriend (Delroy Lindo) must pretend hes a guest. Storms loom in a family that includes feuding daughters a gambler on the run and a soldier gone AWOL but writer-director Preston A. Whitmore II resolves most of the conflicts in a rousing musical finale. One jarring story line features Regina King as a harried wife catering to the needs of her unfaithful husband; the violence of her revenge on him is discomfiting but otherwise this carefully observed film has lots of heart. With Idris Elba Chris Brown and Mekhi Phifer. PG-13 120 min.

Ran on 11-21-2007 Mekhi Phifer and Sharon Leal in amp;quo;This Christmas.amp;quo; Photo Suzanne Tenner Review Home for the holidays with a few secrets in tow 1 / 2 Back to Gallery This Christmas Comedy-drama. Starring Delroy Lindo Idris Elba Loretta Devine Regina King and Mekhi Phifer. Written and directed by Preston A. Whitmore II. (PG-13. 117 minutes. At Bay area theaters.) One family member pulls out a gun and threatens someone in a nightclub. Another rolls her husbands SUV off the side of a concrete barrier (husband fortunately not inside). And yet another surprises everyone with a killer rendition of ""Try a Little Tenderness."" ""This Christmas"" is not your typical family holiday movie and thank goodness for that. Its warm witty and alive with a fantastic cast and a belief in its characters that transcends its formulaic tendencies. The Whitfields are black and they struck me as more representative of an American family than the elitist smug group that formed ""The Family Stone"" and tortured poor Sarah Jessica Parker a couple of years back. You wont even see snow in this movie as the gathering is in suburban Los Angeles at the home of Ma Dear (Loretta Devine). The glue of this wide-ranging family since her husband left years ago she has directed that the Whitfields have their first family gathering in four years and so it shall be done. Ma Dear has three sons and three daughters. Oldest daughter Lisa (Regina King) and her husband (Laz Alonso) are trying to convince the rest of the family to sell their shares in the family dry cleaning business; businesswoman Kelli (Sharon Leal) cant cook unless its with fireman-disguised-as-Santa Gerald (Mekhi Phifer); and college girl Mel (Lauren London) brings her latest boyfriend (Keith Robinson) home to meet the clan. On the mens side Claude (Columbus Short) is an active-duty Marine youngest brother Baby (Chris Brown) still lives with Mom; and theres an unexpected appearance by estranged eldest brother Quentin (Idris Elba in a charismatic performance played just right) a traveling musician in trouble with some debt collectors the kind who carry guns. Thoughtfully written and directed by Preston A. Whitmore II who has dealt with Vietnam (""The Walking Dead"") and the temptations of agents and the lure of big-time sports over education (""Crossover"") in his previous two movies ""This Christmas"" effortlessly fluctuates between comedy and melodrama and sometimes mixes the two (as when Quentins would-be hit men are invited to dinner). Whitmore who uses the lighting schemes of cinematographer Alexander Gruszynski to great advantage proves equally adept at traffic-copping large crowd scenes such as an excellent sequence in which the younger siblings sneak out to a nightclub and small scenes with one or two characters in confined spaces - such as when Ma Dear with a devilish glint in her eye offers Kelli fresh batteries for the vibrator she is not supposed to know her daughter has. As always there are secrets and spoiling them would be no fun but a couple revealed early on provide the reason why ""This Christmas"" was made. At the nightclub Baby goes onstage to sing at an open mike not knowing some of his brothers and sisters are there. Hes great of course but he doesnt dare tell Ma Dear who is dead set against music since her husband a musician split. And theres Ma Dear herself who has been hesitant to allow her longtime boyfriend Joe (Delroy Lindo always welcome) to assume the patriarchal role of the family. Like most holiday family films ""This Christmas"" is about accepting your relatives for who they are. Unlike most however it is also about taking a fresh look at yourself and accepting the person in the mirror warts and all. -- Advisory This film contains adult language mild violence and sexual situations.

For starters the solidly middle-class suburban Los Angeles family gathered for a holiday reunion is unwrapping not only presents but more secrets than in a season of Eugene ONeill - Matriarch MDere (Loretta Devine) is concealing a divorce from the jazz musician who left the family long ago and some of her all-grown children arent even aware that shes been sharing the sprawling family home with her longtime boyfriend Joe (Delroy Lindo). - Marine Claude (Columbus Short) is away without leave and secretly married to a white woman (Jessica Stroup) who unbeknownst even to him is pregnant. - Oldest daughter Lisa (Regina King) is being cheated upon by her snobbish husband (Laz Alonso) who is pressuring her to get the siblings to sell the family business and home. - Oldest son Quentin (Idris Elba) a long-absent traveling musician who detests Joe is secretly deeply in debt to a pair of bookies. - Youngest sibling Baby (Chris Brown) is hiding from MDere the distressing fact that he has chosen to follow Quentin and their father into a musical career. There are yet two more sisters with romantic issues workaholic businesswoman Kelli (Sharon Leal) and college student Mel (Lauren London). It falls largely to Joe to resolve most of these complications and this provides an unusually rewarding role for the veteran Lindo who gives a beautifully shaded performance. Still this is a flick as overstuffed with plot as a Thanksgiving turkey plus two musical numbers and a very lengthy dance sequence featuring the entire cast that precedes the closing credits. The slickly produced ""This Christmas"" is well-directed and not without abundant charms. But at two full hours it can feel as exhausting as a holiday dinner with your own family. THIS CHRISTMASBetter than Tyler Perry.Running time 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexual humor brief violence). At the Union Square the Harlem USA the 84th Street others.

(suzanne tenner/screen gems) Email|Print| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / November 21 2007 If neither your sister with the shady chauvinist husband nor the two bookies trying to shake down 25 grand from your jazz-musician brother can make it to Thanksgiving dinner dont worry. Theyre probably at the Whitfields and you can mosey down to the megaplex to collect them along with all the other made-for-TV craziness afoot in ""This Christmas"" one of those overstaffed overstuffed ""when do we eat?"" holiday dramedies. Call it a double-extra-strength episode of ""Soul Food.""Regina King shares the movie with a lot of talented actors and pretty faces playing the Whitfields - six grown kids one semi-neurotic mother (Loretta Devine) and their assorted significant others. This is a loving family with just enough bitterness for almost every scene to culminate in a showdown.King plays Lisa the sister who resents having not gone to college in order to help maintain the familys Los Angeles-area dry-cleaning business. As a consolation she did marry a haughty Princeton grad (Laz Alonzo). But her sister Kelli (the excellent Sharon Leal) knows hes not worth a damn. He makes Lisa wait on him raise his two kids and tries to get her to convince her siblings to sell the store and the family house so he can put the proceeds to selfish personal ends.There is much more. Claude (Columbus Short from ""Stomp the Yard"") has come home from the military with a gun and a few secrets. Those furtive phone calls he makes shamelessly bait you into thinking hes gay (the movies not that daring). But what he is hiding would definitely be headline news at my holiday dinner. Meanwhile Quentin (Idris Elba) shows up on the run from the aforementioned bookies and hates hates hates his mothers ""friend"" Joe Black (Delroy Lindo) basically for not being his own daddy a music man who ran off years ago but whom his mother called MaDere cant get over.Obviously ""This Christmas"" is unreasonably chock-full of everything - theres even a part for the seductive charms of executive producer Mekhi Phifer as a Whitfield suitor. And what exactly is Lupe Ontiveros to this family besides the woman who stands in the kitchen while everybody else talks?With all due respect to the imagination of the writer and director Preston A. Whitmore II the movies kitchen-sink tone defensively bourgeois characters and embrace of the rambunctious over the realistic is not terribly far removed from Tyler Perry territory. When King squirts baby oil on the bathroom floor as a prelude to comic retaliation I could imagine Perry kicking himself for not coming up with that first. The scene brings down the house.As with Perrys movies and plays ""This Christmas"" is well stocked with crowd-pleasing options. Dont like the plot about Claude and his problems? Then maybe the story line involving the singing dancer Chris Brown as ""Baby"" Whitfield will do the trick. It did the night I saw the movie. When the camera finds him sitting shirtless it was scream at first sight. (His tattoos are never this legible on an iPod screen.) Brown performs two whole songs - one in a club one in a church. The two settings capture the movies bi-devotional spirit (its secular and worshipful at the same time). Theyre also proof that when hes not out of breath Brown can croon.But the movie with its almost pathological need to please ends with a cast-wide ""Soul Train Line"" where Brown does get to do his hydraulic dance moves. Its unnecessary but maybe more movies should take this route. Who wouldnt love to have seen Russell Crowe do the cabbage patch at the end of ""American Gangster""?Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

They also walk pratfall and crash into the L.A. River.This Christmas MaDere (Loretta Devine) matriarch of the clan looks forward to seeing all six of her broods together for the first time in years. Before they arrive though she asks Joe (Delroy Lindo) her live-in love to move his clothes into the garage so she can maintain the fiction that he is just a friend. A holiday evergreen set in the Los Angeles neighborhood of West Adams This Christmas is a family reunion comedy with appealing if familiar characters and a soundtrack upbeat as its story. Writer/director Preston Whitmore II takes the structure of George Kaufmans and Moss Harts You Cant Take It With You the one about those eccentric Vanderhofs peopling it with a contemporary urban family. Instead of the black sheep owing money to the IRS here he owes to bookies. Its been years but MaDere has not yet gotten over the defection of her husband Quentin Sr. a musician whose primary relationship was with his sax. Which is why Quentin Jr. (Idris Elba) the eldest of the kids and Baby (super-talented Chris Brown) the youngest keep their musical skills in the closet. Beware The Whitfield closet is very crowded. Open the door and all kinds of secrets tumble out. Brother Claude a Marine has a relationship hes afraid to share with his family. Sister Mel (Lauren London) is the opposite auditioning yet another beau for family approval. And then theres the battling sisters Lisa (Regina King) who is married and a mom and Kelli (Sharon Leal) a single professional each of whom regards the other as a reproach to her personhood. In a movie that veers from slapstick to sober and back again Whitmore juggles seven storylines and shifting moods with aplomb. Some of the conflicts resolve farcically (who knew baby oil was a lethal weapon?); others dramatically (who knew the deacon was a streetfighter?). The dramatic arcs of the Whitfield men are balanced by the broadly comic arcs of the Whitfield women with MaDere as the stoic fulcrum. There are so many characters in this seesawing affair that no single performance dominates. But Lindos quiet power is really something as is Browns musical force. At the multiplex where so many holiday movies feel regifted This Christmas is a gift.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

""This Christmas"" is a rare holiday treat a package thats both thoughtfully selected and sure to please its intended recipients. With its universal themes highly marketable soundtrack and recognizable cast upbeat comedy centering on a black familys first reunion in four years has unique crossover potential for a variety of demographics though Sony will have to work hard to make that happen theatrically. Pic should do respectable biz this season but recoup very nicely as a holiday staple to be watched time and again. With eager anticipation family matriarch MaDere Whitfield (Loretta Devine) awaits her broods holiday homecoming. Joining her companion Joe (Delroy Lindo) and teenage son Baby (Chris Brown) are homemaker daughter Lisa (Regina King); tough but lonely businesswoman Kelli (Sharon Leal); conflicted college student Mel (Lauren London); returning Marine Claude (Columbus Short); and surprisingly traveling musician Quentin (Idris Elba). Current and prospective mates include Mels beau Devean (Keith Robinson) Lisas materialistic spouse Malcolm (Laz Alonso); and a charming fireman (Mekhi Phifer) with eyes for Kelli. That each of the family members conceals a secret to be revealed in time might seem formulaic but Preston Whitmore II helming his own script has such an assured sense of rhythm and tone that the film moves smartly along. Various truths are exposed concerning Claudes lovelife and military status Quentins debts Lisas female intuition Malcolms extramarital activities and Babys musical ambition but these disclosures happen more or less organically. Latter revelation is pics sweetest surprise as Brown (""Stomp the Yard"") a phenomenally talented performer delivers a dazzling rendition of ""Try a Little Tenderness."" That sequence is one of several musical interludes that fill ""This Christmas"" with an infectiously buoyant spirit. Brown also does a fine job with his climactic take on the title tune and DeNetria Champ as a gospel singer offers a slow-building deeply moving performance of ""O Holy Night."" Soundtrack features a number of well-mounted holiday standards including two family dance segments the second of which feels like an indulgent overlong coda that would have been better placed over the end credits. Still its unusual these days to find a holiday film that doesnt feel as recycled as a fruitcake. Technical elements including Alexander Gruszynskis lensing and Dawn Snyders festive production design are fine. Despite some recognizable L.A. locations and landmarks including the El Rey Theater the storys setting is never mentioned and pic is otherwise awfully heavy on the interiors. Cast led by veterans Lindo and Devine is solid. If ""This Christmas"" is any indication Whitmore helming only his third feature (after the little-seen ""Crossover"" and ""Walking Dead"") may well be a director to watch.
