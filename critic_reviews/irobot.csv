One look at MTV or Londons electronic surveillance web or the careers of Dick Cheney or Silvio Berlusconi says its no longer any great imaginative leap to much of the twentieth centurys classic science-fiction premonitions. Which along with the refinement of fantasy-realising special effects is perhaps why sci-fi has risen up the ranks of Hollywoods favourite exploitation genres. Theres certainly more technical than imaginative expense on show in I Robot a steely proficient facsimile of umpteen of its forerunners. Suggested by Isaac Asimovs 1950 story collection of the same name the film opens quoting his Three Laws of Robotics (robots are coded to protect humans obey humans and survive in that order) before pitching us into the life of Will Smiths agent Del Spooner the last luddite cop in Chicago 2035. Spooner has bad dreams a buff bod and a neurosis about modern automata that manifests itself in a fetish for vintage 2004 footwear and gadgetry (conveniently allowing various contemporary advertisers to pitch us their products from the future). Spooners heckles rise when his old doctor buddy Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) takes a dive out of his reinforced office window at the heart of the corporate behemoth US Robotics and can find no one to point the finger at save for a curiously idiosyncratic NS5 robot prototype. But the company is busy rolling out millions of its new models to households around the country and wants no crack cop upsetting the cart. Pecs under wraps Smith tones down his sass slipping efficiently into the films machine-tooled design scheme. It hasnt a speck of originality and would be more involving as a computer-game but there are several sfx set-pieces that give great pneumatic spectacle and the whole impersonal cautionary concoction offers the salient sight of the machine pulping itself.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"I Robot | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; i-robot ) I Robot (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli When all of the dust from 2004s crumbling blockbusters has settled I Robot will likely emerge as the strongest mainstream motion picture of the summer. The best big-budget science fiction film since Minority Report I Robot gets high marks not only for storytelling but for its compelling vision of 2035 Chicago. Directed by Alex Proyas who previously imagined the strikingly noir cityscapes of The Crow and Dark City I Robot takes ideas (and a character) presented in Isaac Asimovs classic anthology of nine short stories and uses them as a jumping-off point for a thrilling action-adventure movie. Proper recognition goes to credited screenwriters Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman (and uncredited Hillary Seitz) for remaining faithful to the essential themes of Asimovs writing while taking the story in a different more cinematic direction. Asimov fans take note however this isnt close to a faithful adaptation. In fact its not really an adaptation at all. I Robot transpires some 30 years in the future when robots are becoming as familiar an everyday household appliance as refrigerators or vacuum cleaners. But on the eve of the rollout of the landmark NS5 series trouble is brewing at U.S. Robotics. Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) the head of robot and cybernetic research has apparently committed suicide. Technophobe cop Del Spooner (Will Smith) has been called in to investigate and his first suspicion is that Dr. Lanning didnt kill himself - a robot did it. His prime suspect is Sonny (Alan Tudyk) a robot with personality and who seems to have found a way around the Three Laws of Robotics. Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) a robopsychologist who works for U.S. Robotics and CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) are suspicious of Spooners motives for blaming a robot and skeptical of his conclusions. But that doesnt stop Dr. Calvin from aiding the detectives investigation and Robertson who has a lot of money on the line from pulling out all the stops to end it. The films action sequences which include chases and fights are anything but generic. They are directed with flair and that results in them being both tense and involving. The way the robots swarm after Spooner during one of I Robots centerpiece scenes is reminiscent of the aliens attack patterns in James Camerons Aliens. The film carries a sense of the unpredictable; were never sure exactly whats going to happen next and theres no assurance that Spooner will be alive when the end credits roll. These elements not flashes and bangs are what make action films suspenseful. I Robot starts with the story which is more intelligent and engrossing than what we have come to expect from movies in this genre. The script uses the Three Laws of Robotics (developed by Asimov and John Campbell) as its foundation. They state (1) A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm (2) A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law and (3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. Instead of just making these precepts a throw-away aspect of the plot they are integral to its development and success. Take away Asimovs Three Laws and there is no movie. I Robot tinkers with ideas that have always fascinated science fiction fans. At what point does a personality simulation become a personality? Where is the line that divides a machine from a living being? When does consciousness occur? And at what point does an entity achieve the ability to interpret the Three Laws as it sees fit not as they were intended? Theres plenty of thought-provoking material in I Robot - certainly enough to keep a thinking viewer attuned to the plot while never slowing down the proceedings or dulling the action. I Robot deserves to be called ""smart."" It earns that distinction during nearly every frame of its 115-minute running time. The setting - 2035 Chicago - is meticulously realized. Like in Minority Report a great deal of thought went into imagining what the near future might look like. (Admittedly however I think much of what I Robot postulates is too sophisticated for 2035. A better match to the technology evident in the film might be 2070.) Nothing in the film is outrageous. In fact many aspects of life in 2035 arent that different from what they are today. And there are some neat touches (watch how Spooners car is ""parked"" after he arrives at U.S. Robotics). There are no phasers or lasers for weapons - the cops still use good old fashioned guns. Aside from that the film looks stunning - but what else would one expect from the director of an eye-popping spectacle as Dark City? I Robot features some of the best uses of CGI special effects ever. Put this alongside the Star Wars prequels and The Lord of the Rings as a primer for the seamless incorporation of special effects. Theres a lot of computer work in I Robot but its never obvious or evident. It rarely calls attention to itself and it is not clumsily inserted . When Will Smith interacts with a special effect we forget that its an actor posturing with something drawn in by computer. After seeing a lot of cheap effects work that looks like it was exported from a computer game its refreshing to see something of such high quality. Another thing that I Robot does is to prove that Will Smith can carry an action/adventure film on his own. Without support from Martin Lawrence Tommy Lee Jones Gene Hackman Jeff Goldblum or Kevin Kline he shows that hes got enough charisma and energy to hold a viewers attention. Plus he can deliver the mandatory one-liners with as much brio as Schwarzenegger or Willis. Despite the physicality of the role Smith manages to connect with the audience in everyman fashion and although the part requires a certain amount of wit he doesnt play it like a clown. Effective but not outstanding secondary work is provided by Bridget Moynahan (The Recruit) who plays the lead human character from Asimovs stories. Bruce Greenwood is instantly recognizable as a bad guy because he has become one of Hollywoods favorite villains ever since he graduated from the obscurity of Atom Egoyan films (which still represent his best work to-date). Although I Robot isnt quite as pulse-pounding or intellectually challenging as Minority Report it stimulates many of the same areas of the brain and causes the body to pump nearly as much adrenaline. In almost every way imaginable it satisfies and that (unfortunately) has been a rare quality at the multiplexes this summer. This is a movie to restore the faith of those who had given up on science fiction after The Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions. By adeptly combining action and ideas it proves that Hollywood can still produce astonishing entertainment.

You know it. And thats good news for us the willing minions of the military-industrial-complex of Sonys Warners and other Big Brothers Inc. of our collective entertainment. ""I Robot"" which intercuts live action and computer-generated imagery with breathtaking seamlessness (can we still use tailoring terms for these things?) is fabulous mental escape. Its fun and playful rather than dark and foreboding. And there doesnt seem to be an original cyber-bone in the movies body. But its put together in a fabulous package. Theres one crucial reason behind the movies success. Drumroll please Its a great story by Akiva Goldsman and Jeff Vintar. This futuristic flickorama supposedly an amalgam of Vintars original script (""Hardwired"") and Isaac Asimovs ""I Robot"" collection of short stories flows nicely. The wonderful robot effects Smiths likable personality Alex (""The Crow"") Proyass atmospheric direction and so on? Theyre top-notch sure. But its the story that makes them work makes it all happen. Smith plays Del Spooner or more accurately Will Smith. But thats all right. Thats what people come for. Spooner has never liked robots which have become ubiquitous in 2035. Chicago and the rest of the world teems with them. As created by the benevolent Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) the NS-5 robots which have positronic brains are built to serve and protect humankind. They are almost human with their hard-wire circuits designed to obey three simple laws. All of them have to do with safety for humans first and robots second. These robots would never never never do anything scary or harmful toward people. Guess where this story is going. Spooner suspects robot intrigue after the mysterious death of Dr. Lanning who has fallen from a tall building. But suicide is the official conclusion by USR Corp. run by the cold distant corporately hissable Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood). And Spooners cliched African American superior (who yes is feeling pressure from above) buys the story too. Spooners hunch proves right when an NS-5 robot named Sonny one of the seemingly faceless billions attacks him and makes an attempt to escape. With the slow-moving help of Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) a psychologist with an expertise in robots (or something) Spooner begins to uncover well what detectives always do in these films. Time is running out. The NS-5 series is scheduled to be employed in every home. I think 21st-century humankind could have done without Spooners cutesy grandmother (played by Adrian Ricard) her existence a clear attempt to reprise the successful family scenes in the ""Spider-Man"" films. And I would have loved to see one of the NS-5s deep-sixing Farber (Shia LaBoeuf) a completely irrelevant kid pal of Spooners whos only in the movie to make the teenagers in the audience feel appreciated. Also was it in Smiths ego contract to emphasize his body build and appear in a ridiculously contrived shower scene to thrill da ladies? Puhleez. For the most part this is thrilling fun. And if you remember it more than 23 minutes after youve seen it youre missing the point. And speaking of remembering things is it possible that the filmmakers have slipped in a few political jibes against the Bush administration? The villain at the center of all this makes comments about protection against the enemy and forcing society to suffer a little loss in liberty; and it seems that the good robots are sort of bluish while the evil robots are you guessed it red. Well its a minor topic for the parking lot afterward. The bigger topic really is the sheer fun of all this.

"Dream Machine washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Dream Machine Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 16 2004 On paper ""I Robot"" should qualify as one of those ill-conceived literary adaptations at which Hollywood excels. This bastardization of Isaac Asimov short stories nods toward the science-fiction master only in the most cursory fashion appropriating a plot point here and a couple of characters there in the service of an otherwise formulaic action thriller. But as unlikely as it sounds the whole thing works for the most part thanks to the always-appealing presence of Will Smith but also due to the lively imaginative but judiciously restrained direction of Alex Proyas (""The Crow"" ""Dark City""). Asimov purists looking for a faithful visualization of the seminal 1950s sci-fi parables should check such expectations at the multiplex door. ""I Robot"" doesnt do for the eponymous book what ""Blade Runner"" did for Philip K. Dicks ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" But it does succeed on its own terms as an entertaining mid-season popcorn movie that gives Smith a chance to maximize his considerable talents as a leading man. ""I Robot"" doesnt swing for the rafters and therein lies its modest but undeniable strength. The year is 2035 and Chicago police detective Del Spooner (Smith) is called to investigate the apparent suicide of robotics pioneer Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell). Loosely based on the Asimov character Elijah Bailey Spooner is something of a Luddite. At a time when robots have taken over the most menial jobs and sartorial habits tend toward anything in black pleather the hotshot policeman spurns the help of computerized servants and wears such vintage footwear as Converse All-Stars. (One of the films wittiest subtexts is that most of the antiques are circa 2004.) Spooner immediately suspects that one of Lannings creations had a mechanized hand in his death. Soon hes on the trail of a particular robot nicknamed Sonny who leads Spooner on a high-tech goose chase. (In addition to Lanning Asimov fans will recognize the three robot laws which specify among other things that robots must always obey and never harm a human being.) Perhaps because its Chicago many of those chases look as if theyre conducted in the connector between United terminals at OHare airport; Proyas has done a good job of making the future look distinct without being completely unrecognizable. And at a time in cinematic history when building a new-looking robot is next to impossible in Sonny he has succeeded in devising a creature that although undoubtedly mechanical in its origins still manages to exude emotions in its Kabuki mask of a face. (Sonny is the creation of both digital effects and actor Alan Tudyk whose silky voice is reminiscent of C-3POs in ""Star Wars."") From a terrific scene in which Spooner searches for his quarry amid rows of neatly arranged identical robots to a HAL-like supercomputer that looks like an animated Chuck Close portrait ""I Robot"" is full of visually arresting answers to the challenge of establishing memorable sympathetic individuals in an otherwise homogeneous cast of characters. Although events in ""I Robot"" eventually call for thousands of robots to swing through Chicagos urban canyons like so many computerized Spider-Men and although Smith is given plenty of car chases showdowns and death-defying predicaments to show off his signature brand of offhand derring-do the movie at its core has to do with relationships. Not only does Spooner strike up a teasingly romantic friendship with psychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) but he begins to examine the roots of his own antipathy toward robots. As viewers are given more insight into this side of Spooners story what at first seems to be a rather obvious allegory about slavery and racism takes on deeper psychological meaning. For his part Sonny too has dreams only theyre not of electric sheep (or are they?). But as Proyas and screenwriters Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman ensure things never get too deep in ""I Robot."" Indeed things are kept just superficial enough to make sure that Smith can glide smoothly among the films changing moods of action drama comedy and romance. It takes an actor of supreme skill to pull off such tonal shifts and Smith does so with attractive nonchalance. Whether hes brooding like a neo-noir antihero or responding to certain death with an unstudied wisecrack his confidence never lapses into self-regard. Smith makes it look easy but underneath the physical high jinks and slick veneer of ""I Robot"" lies a performance of real discipline and intelligence. I Robot (114 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for intense stylized action and some brief partial nudity.

Genre devotees and Will Smith fans should help launch this second of Foxs trio of big sf/fantasy summer releases but prospects for a prolonged flight arent promising. A humans vs. robots saga that feels machine-made ""I Robot"" looks to have been assembled from the spare parts of dozens of previous sci-fi pictures. Effect is doubtless due to the fact that many elements of Isaac Asimovs prescient 1950 collection of nine stories have been mined developed and otherwise ripped off by others in the intervening years although thats no excuse for the lack of freshness and personality in this 100 million-plus CGI extravaganza. Genre devotees and Will Smith fans should help launch this second of Foxs trio of big sf/fantasy summer releases (after ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and before ""Alien Vs. Predator"") but prospects for a prolonged flight arent promising. Aussie helmer Alex Proyas showed a flair for creating artificial self-contained universes as well as for fusing effects with real action in his first two features ""The Crow"" and ""Dark City."" With this payoff picture however his touch abandons him as this vision of Chicago 2035 seems like an indifferent and artistically unappealing hodgepodge of hypothetical futures already glimpsed elsewhere. The collision of man and machine allied with the notion the latter can be endowed with minds and even souls of their own constitutes a theme nearly as old as speculative fiction itself. The influences on ""I Robot"" long planned as an Arnold Schwarzenegger project and eventually merged with Jeff Vintars original script ""Hardwired"" palpably include among others ""Metropolis"" ""2001"" ""Colossus The Forbin Project"" ""Logans Run"" ""Futureworld"" ""Blade Runner"" the ""Terminator"" series ""A.I."" ""Minority Report"" and God help us ""Bicentennial Man."" Downplaying his trademark charm and humor to dangerously diminished returns Will Smith plays Windy City homicide detective Del Spooner a divorcee whose most evident eccentricities are an aversion to the technology that dominates the world 30 years hence and a taste for archaic music and fashion dating back at least to 2004. This predilection occasions in the films opening scene the first of what turn out to be many product placements as Spooner has a thing for ultra-retro Converse sneakers. Detailing of the cops morning routine also provides the opportunity although hardly the justification for a full-body nude shower scene that provoked audible femme reaction at the preview screening and could bolster the current argument that whats PG-13 today wasnt your daddys PG-13. Spooner is called in to investigate the suspicious death of a visionary robotic scientist (James Cromwell) on the eve of the mass distribution of the most sophisticated domestic mechanized beings yet from the biggest such company in the world U.S. Robotics. Spooner who admits to a prejudice against robots smells murder and a robot murder at that although his theory flies in the face of Asimovs famous three laws for the integration of robots into human society A robot cannot harm a human being or allow one to be harmed a robot must obey human instructions unless they contradict the first law and a robot must protect its own existence unless it conflicts with the other two laws. Such are the intertwined vested interests of the governmental/industrial complex that Spooner after being discouraged from pursuing his leads is thrown off the police force altogether. But certain theres a renegade robot running around that has broken the accepted codes of conduct Spooner persists in his investigation as often as not in the company of icy USR psychologist and robot humanizer Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) who could use a little humanization herself. Suspect is Sonny an example of the latest line of robots one with a sculpted human-shaped face buffed metal body exposed cable musculature and a voice that in its polite and calm articulation more than echoes that of HAL in ""2001."" In the manner that Andy Serkis created body movements and then supplied the voice for Gollum in the last two ""Lord of the Rings"" films so has Alan Tudyk (who played the ""pirate"" player in ""DodgeBall"") done for Sonny whose physical presence like those of his fellow robots has been rendered via computer in a way both technically superb and dramatically indifferent. It shortly becomes apparent that the new generation of robots is geared for revolution and that with their great strength mobility and numbers robots will put the ""suicidal"" reign of humankind to rest once and for all. Clash provokes a succession of chases and combat scenes that becomes progressively more farfetched climaxing in a cataclysmic battle in the yawning central shaft of the USR skyscraper that would tax the antigravitational powers of Spider-Man or Batman much less a Chicago cop like Spooner. Along with the severe sense of deja vu concerning the robots a major problem is the lack of dynamic between Spooner and Dr. Calvin. Latter role is conspicuously underwritten but even at that Moynahan fails to bring desired layers of braininess ambiguity inner conflict or motivation to a part that needed something -- anything -- to animate it. Tight wardrobe choices that fit her like straightjackets are further detriments. Even the generally irrepressible Smith has been tamped down to an unreasonable extent to the point where he expresses little other than generalized determination. Bereft of his usual sense of cocky impudence and impulsiveness the star is left with standard-issue contrariness. Dialogue contrived by Vintar and rewriter Akiva Goldsman is lackluster in the extreme. Given the time and money poured into this enterprise over the years the bland unparticular nature of the result is a disappointment. Aside from some vast cityscapes that show recognizable Chicago landmarks mixed in with futuristic architectural achievements (pic proper was shot in Canada) theres little thats arresting in the films view of urban life 30 years on Rotary-movement all-directional car wheels here underpinning what look like advanced versions of the Audi TT have been seen before and the wealth of speculative specifics offered by a film such as ""Minority Report"" is nowhere present. Clothing hairstyles and other era-marking details could just about pass as present-day. Long before its predictable resolution ""I Robot"" asserts itself as a failure of imagination a look at the future that doesnt grab the mind and transport the viewer to a place ones never been to before; in fact it seems like exceedingly familiar terrain. Technically pic is very accomplished -- just what one would expect from a machine.

Or I Robot Solemnly Swear to Run Amok and Get Will Smith All Riled Up. Rage against the machine Will Smith interrogates a suspect in I Robot. 20th Century Fox Rampaging robots their legions enhanced by fairly schlocky computer generation are not the best co-stars for the likable Smith. (The hordes of robots actually resemble computer desktop wallpaper more than menacing high-tech creatures.) And Bridget Moynahan as a psychologist and Smiths sort-of love interest is only a notch less robotic than the machines she analyzes. Even Smith winning though he can be with his trademark cockiness and flippant remarks isnt up to his usual standard. Smith usually is at his best with an able co-star (such as Tommy Lee Jones in the Men in Black movies). It cant be easy to dash off witticisms in the company of countless dull-eyed pseudo-humans as he tries to do in I Robot. Or to charm a blue screen. ABOUT THE MOVIE I Robot   (out of four) Stars Will Smith Bridget Moynahan Chi McBride Bruce Greenwood Director Alex Proyas Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for intense stylized action and some brief partial nudity Opens Friday nationwide Director Alex Proyas who showed a real flair for telling a dark tale with 1994s The Crow fails to capture the imagination with this futuristic fantasy suggested by a book of short stories by Isaac Asimov. And there are barely a handful of actors -- Chi McBride as Smiths boss Adrian Ricard as his grandmother and Holes Shia LaBeouf as a wannabe thug -- who seem to have any life to them. The considerable talents of actors Bruce Greenwood (here playing the CEO of U.S. Robotics) and James Cromwell (the reclusive scientist who developed the robots) are wasted. They emerge as mere caricatures. The setting is about 30 years in the future a time when robots are an integral part of society though marginalized in mostly servile positions. Smith plays an all-too-familiar character a detective whos a rebel. A loner he works his hunches and angers those in charge by bypassing bureaucratic policy and mouthing off to his boss. Of course hes the only guy smart enough to suspect that robots arent as trustworthy as touted. He questions the laws upon which their maker U.S. Robotics certifies them A robot cannot hurt a human being or allow a human to come to harm. And a robot must always obey a humans orders unless the orders conflict with the first law. Anyone who has seen the trailer knows those laws were made to be broken. And mayhem will ensue. Smith has a secret that becomes pretty obvious long before its revealed so the movie is hardly a suspenseful thriller. The final protracted battle between man and bot may appeal to teenage boys but the rest of us will find it overly long and fairly dull. Smith does drive a cool high-tech Audi. And a few of the chase scenes in which hes involved are exciting enough. But sitting through I Robot is a fairly numbing experience. Performances plot and pacing are as mechanical as the hard-wired cast.

(AP Photo/Digital Domain) On the hunt for a murderer Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) takes a close look at one of several thousand suspects in ""IRobot."" (AP Photo/Digital Domain) Photo DIGITAL DOMAIN A future that is eerily possible sets the stage for the action-packed I Robot 1 / 1 Back to Gallery I Robot Action. Starring Will Smith Bridget Moynahan and Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Alex Proyas. (PG-13. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""I Robot"" has going for it a world-class sci-fi director in Alex Proyas and the commanding presence of Will Smith who for the first time tones down the irony and holds the screen as a solid leading man. Hes still funny when he needs to be but this time he doesnt act as if being in a movie is in itself funny. He brings a newfound relaxation to his role that allows him to be still for stretches at a time long enough for us to notice that Smith is in his mid-30s now looks it and acts it and it suits him. Proyas Smith and the movies compelling situation -- robots are going bad in the robot-infested Chicago of 2035 -- are enough to make ""I Robot"" seem like more than a likable diversion at least for the first hour. Few directors can match Proyas (""Dark City"") in his ability to make futuristic urban landscapes look gritty and tangible and the world he creates in ""I Robot"" seems like the setting for an important film. Unfortunately the screenplay which is only loosely based on Isaac Asimovs ""I Robot"" stories gradually reveals itself as trivial in comparison -- not bad not ridiculous just small in spirit and lacking in importance. Its still good enough to keep things moving to supply Smith with one- liners and to provide an excuse for the compelling backdrop. Smith plays Spooner a Chicago homicide officer with an affection for old things. His stereo is early 21st century. He listens to Stevie Wonder and wears Converse All-Stars from 2004. He doesnt like robots even though theyre everywhere working not just as domestic appliances but also in most of the service professions -- in sanitation package delivery and bartending just to name three. Its a wonder that any human still has a job. A mystery plot of sorts kicks in with the apparent suicide of Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell) a pioneer in the development of robotics. Spooner is sent to investigate which puts him into contact with Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) the head of the robotics company that is about to roll out its new model. Spooner thinks a robot may have killed Lanning which is exactly the kind of publicity Robertson doesnt need with a robot from his company already scheduled for delivery in every household in America. Whats eerie and intriguing about ""I Robot"" in these early minutes is that its premise isnt all that far-fetched. A future corporation could very well form a partnership with the government to provide robots for every household and families would welcome a machine that could cook clean drive and relieve people of domestic drudgery. At the same time with all the robots plugged into a central database the potential for abuse would be staggering especially if as in ""I Robot"" the robots were stronger and more durable than people. In such circumstances the placement of a robot in every home would be the same as placing a guard in every home. In one swoop an entire populace could be held captive. Yet although ""I Robot"" provokes thought it doesnt exactly deliver thought despite the occasional Cartesian reference to ""ghosts in the machine. "" It delivers action a series of sequences in which robots attack and try to kill our hero. A scene in a tunnel in which two trucks full of robots jump on Spooners car and try to make him crash is typical Its kinetic and attention-grabbing but it looks a little fake. The computer-graphics nature of those robots cant be disguised. The movie does however boast a remarkable CGI creation in ""Sonny"" a robot who thinks dreams and has feelings. Watching ""him"" its hard to believe he was never physically on the set. Greenwood a good actor is underutilized and Bridget Moynahan as the robot psychiatrist who comes to share Spooners suspicions underplays her role. If she and Proyas decided that the character should be withdrawn and hesitant it was an unadventurous choice. In the last third the picture becomes an action frenzy and loses the human element though it maintains interest. A particularly interesting moment comes when we hear the spokesman for the evil force explain its actions Lives must be lost and some freedom sacrificed to maintain safety were told. Obviously someone is trying to make a point with this but its not clear enough to register. -- Advisory Lots of stylized action violence.

"The mechanical heart of I Robot. Slate Sign In Sign Up The mechanical heart of I Robot. The mechanical heart of I Robot. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 15 2004 854 PM RoboFlop The mechanical heart of I Robot. By David Edelstein Smith among bots Over the last 50 years the late Isaac Asimovs ""robot visions"" have percolated through every layer of science fiction Theyre not only the foundation of other peoples sci-fi novels (and trilogies and quintilogies and octilogies) theyre evident in every Star Trek retread and many Saturday morning cartoons. The megabudget I Robot (20th Century Fox) is probably one of the less Asimovian things Ive seen recently despite beginning with Asimovs Three Laws of Robotics. (""1. A robot may not injure a human being etc. ... 2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except when etc. ... 3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as etc. ..."") Watching the movie I spent an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out why such an accomplished fast-paced generally tasteful sci-fi-thriller-mystery with such classic sci-fi tropes and no obvious howlers struck me as so ring-a-ding dull. There is no single answer to this question but the experience did lead me to devise what I call the Three Laws of Robotic Movies 1. A director must respect the laws of space time and motion except where the flouting of said laws of space time and motion is the whole point which it isnt when youre trying to make the action look realistic even though its all been manufactured inside a fucking computer.2. A director may not attempt to conceal his or her witless clunkery with respect to staging shooting and editing action scenes behind the aforementioned impossible-looking cartoony egregiously computer-generated high speeds.3. A director must not make feature motion pictures designed to be seen on large screens exclusively for an audience of adolescent gamers whose fight-or-flight reflexes have developed in inverse proportion to their higher cognitive functions. Advertisement The director of I Robot Alex Proyas systematically violates my three laws and throws in a couple of extra infractions which I cant mention without violating the Three Laws of Spoiler Nondisclosure. (Trust me the guy cheats like mad.) There are people who regard Proyas Dark City as a masterpiece for the ages--I believe Roger Ebert holds seminars in which he goes through the movie frame by frame for something like two years with breaks only for Yom Kippur and Lent. To me Dark City felt like the first Matrix without the kung fu but it did have a nice Philip K. Dickian is-it-real-or-am-I-reading-a-Philip-K.-Dick-novel eeriness and some good hats. The movie of I Robot is set in Chicago of 2035 where every fifth person appears to be a robot. These are not your fathers futuristic movie robots; they look more like beatific movie extraterrestrials with oval heads and a tension between stiff-jointedness and plant-like litheness. Being computer-generated these robots move with impossible swiftness and fluidity which takes a lot of the fun out of watching robots if you ask me. (Who could have predicted that the natural enemy of movie robots would turn out to be computers?) Will Smith plays a homicide detective who hates I mean hates robots as well as all other things 2035-ish to the point of wearing sneakers that you and I can buy in stores today (Id name them for a small fraction of what the studio was paid to put them in the film) and listening to familiar 20th-century pop-rock standards--which must have made things easier for the guy putting together the soundtrack compilation. The Three Laws guarantee that a robot cant possibly harm a human being on purpose but Smith has it in his head they can for reasons I cant reveal without violating the aforesaid Spoiler Laws. When the scientist (James Cromwell as a hologram) who wrote the three Robot Laws winds up splattered all over the lobby of the corporation that builds all the machines Smith smells a robotic rat. The movies palette is a numbing gray black white beige and silver and theres almost no one in it except the homogenized Smith retrofitted with custom action-hero one-liners; the computer-generated robots; and a scientist played by Bridget Moynahan whose starched cheekbones and near-monotonic readings had me convinced that shed turn out to be a machine too. Alas shes just another assembly-line starlet with swollen lips and no discernible life force. There is also a street urchin who is introduced in the first few minutes so that he and his street-urchin pals can come back for a climactic Gangs of New York-style face-off with the computer-generated robots. (It makes the climax of Gangs of New York seem well set-up.) If I werent observing the Spoiler Laws Id tell you about the more evolved perhaps even friendly robot whose dreams fears and emotions prompt the question ""When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness?"" Certainly not in the case of this schematic movie It walks and talks and moves very fast but it never lives. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Who now though would expect them not to? Consider the innocently diabolical HAL in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" with his voice of wounded insolence or that twee butler of a droid C-3PO in the ""Star Wars"" films or Rutger Hauers homicidal yet tragic replicant in ""Blade Runner"" or Peter Wellers RoboCop a half-wrecked alloy of a man haunted by video flashbacks. Or take all of Steven Spielbergs ""A.I."" - please. It would be hard to name a major science-fiction film of the last few decades in which the ghosts of artificial intelligence didnt at least flirt with taking over the machine. So when Del Spooner (Will Smith) the future-world detective of I Robot suspects that a robot has committed murder the corporate technocrats of 2035 Chicago think that hes a troublemaker with a tendency toward high paranoia but the audience is already three steps ahead of him. In the amusing early scenes of ""I Robot"" metal droids that look like wide-awake crash-test dummies are treated as immigrant labor. They walk dogs and pick up the garbage and they gallop through the morning rush hour of Chicago a teeming megalopolis that doesnt look so different from the way it does today except for a few additional skyscrapers fancier locks on the doors and an underground highway system in which burnished vehicles zip along as if flying on a current of air. The robots exist according to three laws that have been hardwired into their systems They can never harm a human; they must follow every human order so long as it doesnt require them to break law one; and they must protect their own existence (without breaking laws one or two). But the wizards at U.S. Robotics whose thrusting fascist headquarters dwarfs the skyline are about to unveil an advanced new generation of robots the NS-5 series whose spooky anthropomorphic design makes the earlier humanoid machines look like tin cans. Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) the genius who pioneered robot technology and invented the three laws has plunged to his death in what appears to be a suicide. At least it does to everyone but Smiths Detective Spooner. When Spooner examines the lab that Lanning jumped (or was pushed) from out of the shadows leaps one of the new NS-5s which then makes its escape. The robots name is Sonny and hes an elegant assemblage of black-cable legs a torso that looks like it was fashioned out of a discarded iMac and a face of white-gray polysynthetic skin that changes expression with imperceptible ease. Physically Sonny is identical to the other NS-5s except that theres an authentic play of personality upon his finely angled nose and thin lips the sad blue gems that are his eyes. His voice is supplied by Alan Tudyk (who was also the model for the characters physiognomy) and the actor speaks in a vaguely British disarmingly calm and cultivated singsong that makes him sound like the love child of HAL and Julie Andrews. Sonny is easily the most charming thing in ""I Robot"" yet for all the supposed amazement of his expressions he still looks like a talking mask shot with Botox and hes not all that vividly written a character. No one in the movie is. ""Suggested"" by Isaac Asimovs book of interlinked stories ""I Robot"" isnt badly directed (by ""Dark City""s Alex Proyas) and it has some nifty choreographed scenes of leaping malevolent droids on the attack. The movie however while tarted up with holograms and steel-on-obsidian decor touches lifted from ""Minority Report"" and ""RoboCop"" has been banged together out of far too many standard-issue parts. A routine Will Smith cop-on-the-hunt thriller at heart ""I Robot"" lacks imaginative excitement. How do we know that Spooner doesnt like or trust robots? Because he declares his badass contempt for them in nearly every scene. A furious Luddite who wears Converse All Stars and still blasts Stevie Wonder from his archaic stereo the character has his conspiracy antennae out so far that the only suspenseful question in the film is How did a robot get around the three laws? Will Smith does his slow-burn renegade number yet by the time he talks tough to a kitty cat I began to notice that Smith interacts with everyone on screen - boss robot corporate enemy that cat - in exactly the same way. The irony of a robot who is just as human as the people around him may not mean that much when even a movies hero is spewing his attitude on autopilot.
