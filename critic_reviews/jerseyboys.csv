Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Sophie Gilbert Jun 20 2014 Culture The question you could be forgiven for asking the question even the cast admitted being perplexed by is why? Why would Oscar-winning director Clint Eastwood he of the bleak Unforgiven and the haunting Million Dollar Baby and the utterly desolate Mystic River want to helm an adaptation of a musical about a 1960s pop quartet and its squeaky-voiced frontman? Why Clint?The answer is simply that hes 84 years old and he can do whatever he wants.For him thats wonderful. For us it means were left with a scattered haphazard thoroughly confused film that cant figure out if its meant to be a winningly cutesy musical or a gritty narrative about life in crime-ridden 1950s New Jersey. Eastwood uses pallid gray filters to suffuse scenes with a somber sense of realism but then the characters abruptly launch into a jaunty musical number complete with fourth wall-smashing narration. The whole thing feels like a fusion of Broadway Babies and VH1s Behind the Music.Related Story Clint Eastwoods Incoherent Politics Eastwoods laissez-faire empty-directors-chair approach to Jersey Boys begins and ends with the material which is too akin to musical theater to translate well to the screen and too overbearingly ""real"" to capture the joyful spirit of the original production. (It debuted on Broadway in 2005 won the Tony for Best Musical and has been touring indefatigably ever since.) The cast is mostly plucked in its entirety from the shows first run with the bouffant sweetly insipid John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli Michael Lomenda as the gormless Nick Massi and Erich Bergen as the clean-cut preppy songwriter Bob Gaudio. Boardwalk Empires Vincent Piazza is the lone familiar face among the Four Seasons playing gambling addict Tommy a not-so-wise guy of infinitely shallow depths.Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice who wrote the book for the Broadway production also penned the script and it shows. On the stage you can get away with clunky jumps in time and unsubtle gags--""Youre right It is more fun with another person"" says Bob to the band after hes deflowered rather aggressively by a diva in a mink stole. But the spotty storytelling of this iteration is eminently unsatisfactory. One minute the bands riding high celebrating three No. 1s with cake and a performance on the Ed Sullivan Show and the next theyre inexplicably suffering with Valli reduced to playing supper clubs and dance halls to pay the bills. Why such a change in fortune? We never really find out. Similarly Vallis troubled family life with his alcoholic wife (Renee Marino another Broadway alum) and drug-addicted daughter (Freya Tingley) is hinted at in a handful of dramatic scenes but not fleshed out enough to have any significant emotional impact.The films darker moments feel jarring after the wholesome apple-pie Americanness of the first half in which even the criminal activity is done winningly. Imagine Bugs Bunny robbing a bank or the Hamburglar planning a McDonalds heist. Sixteen-year-old Frankie is roped in as a lookout while the older Tommy steals a safe; naturally things go wrong and Tommys sent off to jail a place thats apparently a holiday camp run by friends from the neighborhood. Even Frankies rookie attempts to seduce the predatory Mary Delgado dont go according to plan; one minute shes instructing him to call his mother and tell her hell be home late and the next hes marrying her.The films darker moments feel jarring after the wholesome Americanness of the first half in which even the criminal activity is done winningly. This isnt to say that Jersey Boys has no charm. Its impossible not to enjoy the harmonious delivery of ""Sherry"" or the thrilling sense of creative synergy when Bob and Frankie first jam together. Christopher Walken is creakily charming as Gyp DeCarlo the friendly neighborhood mobster who cries like a baby when Frankie sings his mothers favorite song. And the movies climactic scene of an ascendant Frankie finally getting the horn section hes yearned for throughout his career while he belts out ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You"" in 1967 is gorgeous. (The puzzling leaps through time arent helped by an erratic approach to makeup No one ages for several decades but when the band gets back together for its induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame everyone suddenly looks like the Nazi who chose poorly at the end of Indiana Joness Last Crusade.)An odd addition to Eastwoods oeuvre? A vanity project? Definitely and definitely. But when it culminates in a big-budget song-and-dance number in which Frankie jives through the streets of New Jersey with his wife on one arm and his girlfriend on the other you can at least appreciate Jersey Boys as a work of cultural anthropology a chance to see Dirty Harry get squeaky clean.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

By Anthony Lane Valli guys Erich Bergen Michael Lomenda Vincent Piazza and John Lloyd Young.   Credit Illustration by John Jay Cabuay There was a moment in Martin Scorseses ""Goodfellas"" (1990) when Karen (Lorraine Bracco) went to find Henry (Ray Liotta) after he stood her up for dinner. She confronted him and asked ""Who the hell do you think you are Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?"" I remember thinking what an unlikely name it was for Karen to pluck from the air. What was it exactly that gave a guy the right to disrespect a girl--was it the fame or the falsetto? Now we have ""Jersey Boys"" directed by Clint Eastwood which gives us a fresh chance to measure just how big a shot little Frankie was. For the first third of the movie it is Scorsese territory that Eastwood muscles in on. We are in New Jersey in the nineteen-fifties and young Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) cockiness made flesh addresses us head on ""You want to hear the real story?"" The model here is Liotta in ""Goodfellas"" whose voice-over buoyed us through the storms of the action. He never talked to the camera however whereas Tommy can stroll out of prison after an easy six months for theft and other lapses and engage us in conversation outside the gates. His breeziness is catchy and you can sense the movie tuning up to make sweet music. But Eastwood the maker of ""Mystic River"" (2003) and a Charlie Parker biopic ""Bird"" (1988) is not someone to let darkness slip away. Many of the early scenes are staged for shudders and thrills with a cursing match that ends in a gunshot and a safe being manhandled into the trunk of a car as Tommy and his confreres oil themselves into a life of crime. You ask yourself What kind of movie does ""Jersey Boys"" want to be? A clue comes one night as Tommy and a friend get up to mischief leaving Frankie Castelluccio (John Lloyd Young) as their lookout man on the sidewalk. A cop approaches on his beat and Frankie gives the alarm not with a yell or a whistle but with a song--his high effortless tone ringing off the walls of the deserted street. If nightingales listened to Sinatra they would sound like that and the sequence allows Eastwood to put the overwhelming question How do you make trouble and music at the same time? Castelluccio will change his name to Valli; he will team up with DeVito Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) and Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) to create the Four Seasons; they will rise and conquer; and yet all the while we will be reminded just how quickly life can slide off key. The movie is based on the stage musical which was shiny and crisp and so streamlined that you walked out at the end with the tunes ringing in your head and every scrap of plot let alone of emotional setback left under your seat like a candy wrapper. As with all jukebox theatre it asked us to believe that creativity is no sweat; that once inspiration descends you strap on your ready-tuned guitar step up to the mike and unleash. Some of this pleasant nonsense remains in Eastwoods film. We get the guys clustered around a phone pouring the start of ""Sherry"" into the ear of Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) their producer who informs them that by chance he has tapes set up to record; and we get the eureka look that dawns on Gaudios face as Crewe watching ""Ace in the Hole"" on TV explains the allure of the heroine--""big girls dont cry."" Thats the new single taken care of right there. Some tales are even tall and true; apparently the band having hopped from one name to another really did emerge from a bowling alley called the Four Seasons and make the change. In the movie it becomes a sight gag a repairman fixes the sign outside the name flashes up and Nick exclaims ""Its a sign"" Sparks like that are scattered through and yet the sad fact is that ""Jersey Boys"" is a mess. Parts of it feel half-finished. The screenplay is by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice and there are shades of ""Annie Hall"" which Brickman wrote with Woody Allen in the constant shuffle of styles. Look at Nick turning aside to the camera as the Four Seasons play live on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" and talking to us about the bands problems. We get yanked two years into the past for a lengthy flashback about the boys getting arrested over a hotel bill and Tommys obligations to a loan shark. Contractual wrangles ensnare the rest of the movie interspersed with odd revisits to Frankies home life. Renee Marino making her big-screen debut as his wife Mary has one terrific scene when they first meet and she tells him to pick Valli over Vally ("" cause Y s a bullshit letter"") but then she fades from view. Suddenly the marriage is in ruins and Frankie is comforting his daughter Francine (Elizabeth Hunter) of whose existence we are hardly aware; as the parents split a couple of other daughters appear from nowhere. Francine gets a subplot to herself and a fine song ""My Eyes Adored You"" is the result but by now the film is taking random directions as if wondering where they will lead. All this seems precisely unsuited to the talents of Clint Eastwood. He is a master of the clean classical narrative not of lurching moods and similar folderol. In ""Bird"" he and his star Forest Whitaker kept the focus squarely on the person of Parker and took care not to stray too far from the music. So how come in ""Jersey Boys"" we get the instrumental introduction to ""December 1963"" at the start but no straight rendition of it with the explosive vocal line (""Oh what a night"") until the end credits when Eastwood decides to turn his film into ""West Side Story"" and have the whole cast--including characters who have died--show up and dance in the street? As a sendoff its fun not least because Christopher Walken who has popped up here and there as a mafioso figure named Gyp DeCarlo gets to show us his ageless moves but it feels too late and not a little desperate. Still more remiss is Frankies final tribute to the time--the best ever he says--when it was ""just four guys under a street light."" Oops we never actually saw that time so it has to be quickly drummed up for our delight as the film stumbles to a close. Against that Im glad to say we get ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You""--a mold-breaker written by Crewe and Gaudio which premiered at the Roostertail club in Detroit with diners sitting at tables not knowing whats coming. Eastwood gets to flourish his dramatic command and his love of the music at the same time waiting for the buildup after the verse he pulls back a curtain behind the band to reveal a shining brass section and its full-throated blare before Frankie surges back in with the chorus--""I love you baby."" The crowd stands to applaud. Its a clear echo of a lovely scene in ""The Glenn Miller Story"" in which everything locked into place at a performance of ""Moonlight Serenade."" That film was directed by Anthony Mann--a forerunner of Eastwood both men making mighty contributions to the Western and venturing further afield. But Mann held his nerve and told the Miller story as calmly as it deserved letting the music take care of the excitement. Eastwood with the weight of the stage production on his back is unable to relax. ""Jersey Boys"" has its highs but too often you can take your eyes off it. Whenever possible trust your ears. The new Roman Polanski film ""Venus in Fur"" is set entirely or almost entirely in a theatre. Outside thunder groans on a rainy Paris boulevard; inside alone is Thomas (Mathieu Amalric) who has written a play ""Venus in Fur"" and is directing it himself. Today audition day has been frustrating but just as he is packing up to go a latecomer arrives. She is soaked to the skin with a lot of skin to soak removing her raincoat to reveal no more than underwear. In one sense its a perfect fit she is named Vanda (Emmanuelle Seigner) and so is her character--a decorous vamp encountered at a country inn in 1870. Thomas has forged the play from a notorious novel by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch and the clue is in that name. Welcome to the zone of dog collars whips and the scuffed paraphernalia of submission and control. Vanda will do more than read for the role. She will become it. In truth the heart deflates at this for the trappings of such naughtiness creak like old leather. Furthermore the film itself is adapted from a play by David Ives and Polanskis other borrowings from the theatre like ""Death and the Maiden"" and ""Carnage"" have felt more like exercises than like immersions. Now though miraculously he brightens the faded material and conjures his most graceful work in years guiding his camera in a dance around the confined arena and permitting his actors--just the two of them--to duck so freely in and out of character that the wall between the real and the imagined feels no thicker than stretched silk. Even the shortage of props is more of a help than a handicap when Thomas taps a coffee cup with an unseen spoon or Vanda cracks an invisible whip we hear the tinkle and the lash. As the film tightens the playwright is not merely upstaged but engulfed by his fictional creation. What painful joy it is Polanski suggests to be a slave to the rhythm of art.

"Jersey Boys | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jersey-boys ) Jersey Boys (United States 2014) June 20 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Initially the stage-to-screen transition of the Broadway musical Jersey Boys was expected to be helmed by Jon Favreau. When Favreau withdrew it opened the door for veteran director Clint Eastwood to take the reins. Eastwoods approach to telling the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons is less ostentatious than what one might expect from say Rob Marshall. If the musical numbers sometimes lack energy thats mostly because of the way in which they have been filmed. This straightforward biopic account of Vallis life exposes how generic it was. These might be true events but theres nothing in Jersey Boys that we havent seen in other rags-to-riches-to-rags tales. The films notable quality is the music and as soon as one song is finished were ready for the next one. Unfortunately there are often long passages of dialogue and narrative to endure before getting there. This may be a more literate approach to putting the musical oeuvre of a group on screen than Mamma Mia but its also significantly less entertaining. Jersey Boys is presented from the points-of-view of three of the four founding members of The Four Seasons Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) and Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) all of whom directly address the camera from time-to-time. The only one who never breaks the fourth wall is Valli (John Lloyd Young). Although the basic narrative is the same as that of the play the structure has been reworked to be more linear and less perspective-oriented. The story begins in 1951 New Jersey with Frankie being recruited as the lead singer for a group that includes his best friend Tommy and another eventual member of The Four Seasons Nick. Deciding they need a fourth player they conclude a deal with Bob who in addition to playing an instrument is a writer. After toiling for a while in low-paying gigs they score a record contract and three hit singles follow ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" and ""Walk Like a Man."" But as they rise to the top of the charts and make appearances on ""American Bandstand"" and ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" cracks appear especially regarding Tommys participation. His debts to a loan shark threaten to sink him. This eventually results in The Four Seasons breaking up and Frankie going off on his own. Three of the four actors playing the leads were recruited from professional productions of Jersey Boys including John Lloyd Young who originated the role of Frankie on Broadway. Two other members of the Broadway cast are also seen on screen Erica Piccininni as Frankies mistress and Donnie Kehr as the loan shark Norm Waxman. Joining Young Michael Lomenda and Erich Bergen is Vincent Piazza who had no previous connection to Jersey Boys but who fits in fine. As was the case with the stage version the way in which Youngs voice approximates Frankie Vallis is one of the most remarkable things about the film especially when one considers that the songs were recorded during live takes not dubbed in post-production. All four of the principals do solid work and its easy to see why Eastwood chose Piazza who is the standout. The only ""name"" actor to appear is Christopher Walken and as usual his performance is top-notch oozing snake oil salesman charm. The most disappointing aspect of Jersey Boys is how dramatically inert the production is. Several scenes are devoted to developing the tragic interaction between Frankie and his daughter Francine. Yet when a resolution arrives the emotional payoff is minimal. Eastwood never ""sells"" the relationship to the point where we become invested. The narrative follows a simple unremarkable trajectory that provides an excuse to plunder The Four Seasons catalog. And although the staging of the songs is mostly restrained and straightforward the music is strong enough in its own right to hold the viewers attention. (Although this may be an age-dependent comment since most of these songs were chart-toppers during the 1960s and will hold minimal appeal for younger viewers.) Visually Eastwood and cinematographer Tom Stern elect to present the movie with desaturated color. While never in full black-and-white this ""faded"" approach is appropriate for a group whose days at the top of the charts are long past and who now exist in the province of oldies radio stations. The period detail is impeccable. This looks like the cast and crew took a time machine back into the 50s and 60s and made the movie then. Jersey Boys comes to life only toward the end. When Frankie sings ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You"" theres a palpable energy. Later at the start of the end credits Eastwood finally gives us a song-and-dance number with ""December 1963 (Oh What a Night)"". Its a great moment but it makes us realize how much more lively the entire film could have been. Although not a rote adaptation of the play (it has been reworked to make it more conventional and cinematic) it should please fans of the live version. Of course those with an affinity for The Four Seasons will adore it. But the film lacks the inherent greatness that would allow it to entice a wider audience. As such its more of a niche film than a mainstream offering.

"Jersey Boys - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Jersey Boys Posted by Christy Lemire on June 21 2014 14 Comments Warner Bros. Pictures Rated R for language throughout. Running time 134 minutes. Two stars out of four. The Four Seasons music was poppy frothy infectious. Clint Eastwoods movies are moody weighty elegant. These two artistic instincts wouldnt seem to be a good fit for each other and as it turns out theyre not. Eastwoods film version of the hit Broadway musical ""Jersey Boys"" which tracks the rise and fall and (sort of) rise of the 60s singing group The Four Seasons never grabs you the way it should. Its glossy and entertaining but also safe and conventional. If my father had lived to age 72 he would have loved this movie. This is your target audience. Eastwood -- directing a script from the shows original writers Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice -- traces the groups origins and their key performances but never enlightens us as to what drove these men never infuses the film with much passion. Frankie Valli whose otherworldly falsetto provided the foursome with its signature sound remains a cypher even after two-plus hours on screen. We know hes talented beyond his years as a teenager singing with his buddies on the sidewalks of blue-collar New Jersey and we know that his friends urge him to keep honing his gift in hopes that hell avoid falling into a life of crime like so many others around him. But what inspires Valli (John Lloyd Young a Tony-winner for playing the role on Broadway) to persevere through decades of highs and lows remains elusive. Is he just in it for the money? The women? The glory? Eastwood is a lifelong lover of music and a musician himself having composed the scores for several of his own films including ""Mystic River""""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Flags of Our Fathers."" Its easy to see why hed want to tell this particular story of struggle and success. But he maintains the stage shows structure of allowing the band members to break the fourth wall and address the audience directly with each man sharing his version of what ""really"" happened ""Rashomon""-style. Rather than serving as a source of intimacy the device keeps us at arms length -- and ironically doesnt reveal the characters as fully fleshed-out figures. Vincent Piazza as the groups founder and driving force Tommy DeVito is a fascinating wild card at first. Between gigs he does odd jobs for local mob boss Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken). Hes selfish. Hes a hothead. Hes potentially dangerous. But in time those qualities subside and he fades into the background. Then theres goofy bassist Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) who gets little more to do than function as the goofy bassist. But the introduction of straight-laced keyboardist and songwriter Bob Gaudio (a confident and great-looking Erich Bergen) helps put them on their path to pop greatness with hits like ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" ""Walk Like a Man"" and ""Rag Doll."" Eastwood shoots these performance as an observer from a distance which drains them of some of their energy. ""Dreamgirls"" this is not. The production values are impeccable though as youd expect from one of his films. Tom Stern his longtime cinematographer desaturates the colors off-stage to create a feeling of nostalgia and really lets them pop on-stage when The Four Seasons are working their magic. Production designer James J. Murakami steeps the settings in period detail. Veteran editor Joel Cox keeps things moving at a decent clip. But Eastwood and his team of talented behind-the-scenes figures with their decades of experience and expertise just cant get past the cliche-addled script. The egos the infighting the power struggles. The groupies the partying the money problems. The rise up the charts and all the distractions that come with it -- weve seen this story told a million times before and usually in montage form. But there are bright spots. The magnetic Mike Doyle livens things up as the groups producer Bob Crewe. He adds some much-needed tongue-in-cheek humor and finds a fine balance between being an amusing effeminate and a flamboyant gay caricature. (The sequence in which hes introduced in a fluid pan up New Yorks famous Brill Building is a dazzler.) Renee Marino as Vallis first wife Mary is a commanding presence when he -- and we -- first meet her. Snappy and sexy as hell her opening scene is a doozy. But the swaggering tough-talking woman eventually becomes a stereotypically bitter neglected pill-popping shrew. It seems like a missed opportunity for such a charismatic actress. Similarly Vallis relationship with his eldest daughter Francine is awkwardly drawn; shes largely absent and then out of nowhere were told shes a talented singer in her own right which is meant to serve as a poignant connection between them. Walken is reliably Walkenesque as the local gangster who controls their fate -- dryly oddly charming but also a bit fearsome. Its a huge waste though that in the big production number of ""December 1963"" with all the cast members at the end -- Eastwoods recreation of the curtain call -- the famously gifted hoofer is relegated to the sidelines. Youre waiting for the big Walken solo and it never comes. Its tough to tell this kind of tale in an innovative way. The music biopic in the vein of ""Ray"" or ""Walk the Line"" is a genre with such obvious and repeated tropes that its already been a source of parody. Jake Kasdans ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"" perfectly replicated the way these stories tend to go from humble roots to stratospheric stardom to an equally spectacular drop with plenty of egos drugs booze and women to complicate the mix. Theres a scene in ""Walk Hard"" in which Dewey (John C. Reilly) and the bandmates he barely knows break into the song that would become his signature out of nowhere in the studio intuitively adding harmonies and bass and piano lines. Its hilarious because its so false. ""Jersey Boys"" has a similar moment thats played with dead seriousness when Gaudio auditions for the three other group members and they all click intuitively impossibly as he plays ""Cry For Me"" for the first time. The cliche has come full-circle onto itself.

Her reviews are more cliche than cliches. Reply January 26 2015  by  Nick     ""Her reviews are more cliche than cliches""? I admire your courage to not only avoid cliches but avoid meaning amp; communication all together Reply June 23 2014  by  Art     Glossy is correct... ""Jersey Boys"" is the play and that is it not a great movie piece (bad job Clint Frankie and Bob) should have shown it with some character and not a play / musical. I have been in bands that did Four Seasons (I sang Frankie) and know them well - Listen to the breath break in Walk Like a Man - wrong vocal The lead is cast wrong Bad Actor and (The man is a good singer / not great- good but as Frankie rolls from full voice to falsetto he does not)most parts are cast wrong. Dialogue is horrible Script needs work (when Frankie daughter dies this man does not get that feeling of intense hurt) in places and the story should have been darker as life is - anyone who knows about success in the entertainment biz knows you pay your dues. Art Reply August 7 2014  by  kreed     So I would like to see your four major awards that John Lloyd Young has if you are so damn good as Frankie. John Lloyd Young is the best Frankie except for Frankie himself. It is a fact. Reply June 24 2014  by  Dr. John D. Van Dyke     Im sorry but writing this after praising Justin Biebers ""Never Say Never"" rings somewhat hollow. https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KL-3HNd8hc Reply June 29 2014  by  Rhonda     Ms. Lemire is totally wrong about the target age. My son and his girlfriend saw this movie last week and they absolutely loved it. He is 19 and she is 18. He cant stop talking about the music and has recently purchased Four Seasons CDs. I think this movie has reinvented that era of music. Reply July 6 2014  by  Cindy     I think you are 100 percent wrong. I am in my early 50s my son in his early 30 s we both loved the movie. Why would u even go there that someone needs to be in their 70s to like this movie. That was a really dumb comment. Reply July 15 2014  by  ""Alleycat""     Im 73 and was the first DJ in SoCal to play rock and roll on FM (KNAC 105.5) in 1963. I saw and heard them all come and go. The Four Seasons were special. Nobody cared about their lives - only their music. The trip the public takes on celebritys lives is a publicity creation nothing more. These guys put out first class tunes. In the day it was about style and song. Not always in that order. The Seasons had a perfect match with their style and songs. I actually havent seen the movie because I dont want to be let down. From most of the Rotten Tomato reviews I think Id be (let down). Some memories of the great artists of rock and roll are best served by just hearing the music - not by a movie trying to tell you what it was all about. Reply August 7 2014  by  kreed     ""If my father had lived to age 72 he would have loved this movie. This is your target audience."" AND YOUR POINT IS ... ? Reply August 7 2014  by  Bow     You say the target audience was 72 however I am 17 and loved the movie. Im sorry Christy but you should spend more time with your dad Reply August 7 2014  by  Christy Lemire     You know I would love to do that but he died in 1995. Thats why I say ""If my father had lived to age 72 he would have loved this movie."" Reply January 26 2015  by  Nick     Hope this kid just missed that point and is not as I first read it wishing you were dead. Reply August 23 2014  by  Cindy     Christy I get it. My dad passed away in 2004 at the age of 67. He would have absolutely loved this movie too. His birthday is next week and I wish I could take him to see it. As an unrelated side note my friend won a Tony for his Jersey Boy performance on Broadway  Reply January 26 2015  by  Nick     I was searching online for anyone else comparing this by-the-numbers music biopic to ""Walk Hard"" and the first result was Christy Lemire of WtF - nice Only life in the movie besides the gay dude is Tommy and hes randomly out of the movie while we watch the worst (movie) actor of the bunch (admittedly with good pipes) grind out his million-dollar debt - fun Bonus tacked-on tragedy for someone were told we should care for but we see for what 2 minutes? Ugh this movie was so bad I cant sleep. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Reply from Richard Roeper I stand by my review.Dennis Lindberg said on Friday June 20 2014 82533 PMDisappointing except for the musical numbers; especially Cant Take My Eyes Off of You and the closing ""curtain call"" number. To me the performances felt forced and I felt bombarded by the accents. I didnt dislike it but expected more. For me a 5.5 or 6 on a scale of 10.

"Jersey Boys the movie directed by Clint Eastwood reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Jersey Boys Come Come Come On Clint Eastwood Jersey Boys Come Come Come On Clint Eastwood Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 20 2014 619 PM Jersey Boys As I recall it ended none too soon. By Dana Stevens From left to right Erich BergenVincent Piazza John Lloyd Young and Michael Lomenda star in Jersey Boys. Photo courtesy Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros./RatPac Entertainment Jersey Boys Clint Eastwoods curiously moribund adaptation of the still-running multiple-Tony-winning Broadway jukebox musical about the career of doo-wop legends Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons contains a fleeting appearance by the directors younger self. In one scene as two characters sit around watching a small black-and-white TV (its the early 60s after all) Eastwoods familiarly flinty face appears on the small screen playing a cowboy in a Western. Its a reminder that when these young Italian-American crooners were practicing their tight harmonies under the streetlights of New Jersey Eastwood was already an established actor doing his own thing far away on the West Coast--a reminder if the movie itself wasnt enough of one that the regional and ethnic subculture depicted in Jersey Boys exists at a far remove from Eastwoods own personal history at the time. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Given that Eastwood has never directed a musical before he pulls off the performance numbers with a modicum of style. (He is after all a jazz aficionado whos made a Charlie Parker biopic and composed the scores for seven of his own films to say nothing of his own career as a crooner.) The choice to have the performers sing live to tape rather than lip-synch to prerecorded tracks gives the musical numbers a freshness and immediacy thats absent from most of the dramatic scenes. Vallis signature piercing falsetto is emulated to perfection by the vocally gifted John Lloyd Young who played the role in the original Broadway production and won a Tony for it. But Young--like all of the actors playing the Four Seasons with the exception of Vincent Piazza as the thuggish Tommy DeVito--is a stage performer imported directly from either the Broadway or touring company of Jersey Boys and the shift between these two radically different mediums isnt always smooth. For example Young whos a baby-faced 38 also plays Valli in the early scenes as a 16-year-old kid--a convention that might work onstage but that on film comes off as simply strange especially when Frankies fellow band members (all played by actors roughly Youngs age) comment on his extreme youth. In those early scenes Frankie Valli is still Francesco Castelluccio a nice kid growing up in a tightknit Italian-American enclave of North Jersey with some less-than-nice friends including truants Tommy (Piazza) and Nick (Michael Lomenda) who enlist him as a driver in their small-time jewelry heists when they arent encouraging him to develop his singing voice with their band. While Nick and Tommy take turns doing jail time Frankie makes his living as a barber. It isnt until the band adds a keyboardist and songwriter Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen)--best known at the time as the teenage composer of the novelty song ""Short Shorts""--that the Four Seasons find their sound as well as a manager the flamboyantly gay Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) who knows something about the business of hit-making not to mention old-fashioned radio payola. Advertisement In short order this prolific pair of Bobs co-write a string of hits--""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" ""Walk Like a Man""--that propel the groups hooky sound to the top of the charts. (The musical backdrop against which all this is happening strangely is rendered as a contextless blank--in this movies version of the 60s neither the Beatles nor Motown seem to exist though we do get a glimpse of the girl group the Angels singing ""My Boyfriends Back."") The middle section of the film slips into overfamiliar musical-biopic territory as the boys early camaraderie is worn down due to the tensions of constant touring and the gradual revelation of Tommys gambling problem (which has him in serious debt to the mob and embezzling from the bands tax fund). Local mob kingpin Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken) tries to bail the boys out of financial trouble but he cant solve the family problems caused by years spent on the road. Frankies once-vibrant wife Mary (Renee Marino) has become a bitter lonely alcoholic and their daughter Francine (Freya Tingley)--who emerges in the third act as a character the audience is suddenly expected to care about--has been running away from home experimenting with drugs and neglecting to develop her singing talent. (She had singing talent? News to us.) As the third-act melodrama ramps up to a feel-good finale--the bands triumphant 1975 comeback with ""December 1963 (Oh What a Night)"" and their eventual induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame--Eastwood makes increasing use of a direct-address-to-the-camera device introduced early in the film in which each band member recounts events from his own point of view. It isnt until the closing credits which feature a big bouncy all-cast performance of the irresistibly sing-able ""December 1963"" that this awkwardly transposed stage musical begins to find a voice of its own. That last big production number--in which every character including Walkens suave gangster gets a walk-on (or dance-on) role--hints at the broad cheerfully campy musical celebration Jersey Boys might have been. If you want to see that show tickets for the Broadway production are still available. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Mars Distribution hide caption toggle caption Mars Distribution Mathieu Amalric as a Roman Polanski look-alike and Emmanuelle Seigner -- the directors real-life wife -- play psychosexual mind games in Venus in Fur. Mars Distribution An intellectual play about sadomasochism a musical about a 60s pop group and a pair of famously cinematic directors. Theres always going to be a bit of a leap when a play moves from stage to screen -- but Roman Polanskis Venus in Fur and Clint Eastwoods Jersey Boys leap a little further than usual. A director is casting a new play at the start of Venus in Fur and auditions have been ghastly. The play is based on a 19th century novel by bondage fan Leopold Von Sacher-Masoch -- we get the term masochism from his last name -- and the plays writer/director is convinced hell never find a sexy leading lady who has both classical training and a brain. Vanda a very late arrival for the audition only reinforces his doubts. Doing vocal exercises she sounds like a fishwife and shes dressed dominatrix-style in black leather where a lacy dress with a bustle would suit the character better. But it turns out she has one of those in her bag. And her voice turns more delicate when she starts speaking the plays lines -- from memory much to the directors surprise. Lines about sexual fantasies involving fur coats and childhood spankings. Roman Polanskis been making films about psychosexual mind games for decades and when his opening shot poses his stage director next to a very phallic cactus you know hes at it again. But theres more going on in the movie Venus in Fur than the male-female power struggle that playwright David Ives put in his original stage script. He and Polanski adapted it from English to French because Polanski wanted to tweak the film in a personal way by casting a Polanski look-alike Mathieu Almaric as the director. The filmmaker even gave Amalric the haircut he himself used to wear. And as Vanda Polanski cast his own real-life wife actress Emmanuelle Seigner. So where the play had the stage actress and her director sort of morphing into the characters as they rehearsed the movie blurs not only those lines but the ones between the films creators and the folks on-screen. Factor in the unequal power dynamics in Polanskis off-screen history and well lets just say that the sexual tension in Venus in Fur acquires a few specifically Polanski-esque layers. i Jersey Boys the film version of the hit musical focuses tightly on its titular Boys at the expense of the rest of the early 60s music scene. GK Films hide caption toggle caption GK Films Jersey Boys the film version of the hit musical focuses tightly on its titular Boys at the expense of the rest of the early 60s music scene. GK Films Clint Eastwood also puts a little of his younger self into Jersey Boys -- a black-and-white Rawhide episode is playing on TV at one point but thats just a joke about the early 60s. As a director what Eastwood brings to this Broadway smash is a seriousness you dont expect in a musical about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. He doesnt even start with a song. He starts with a scene that couldve been in Goodfellas -- a barbers 16-year-old son giving a shave to a local mob boss and by accident nearly slicing the guys throat. The mob boss happily is a fan of the kids throat or at least the vocals that emanate from it. The hard work is to find a sound that goes with Frankies angelic falsetto and they find it when they team up with a guy who also sings high and clear -- and who writes them a song that gets a record producer excited even over the phone. Pop stars pretty much overnight the group then has the usual ups and downs long tours broken marriages money trouble. And where on Broadway each scene leads neatly to a song in a more realistic movie there are (perhaps necessarily) going to be arid stretches. Eastwoods got a feel for music (he composed the scores for most of his recent films). But he doesnt have a particular flair for musical staging so the concert scenes just dont pop. Hes better with the backstage stuff even when dialogue sounds theatrically contrived. Eastwoods production team rounded up enough vintage cars to capture the look of the 60s but Jersey Boys is too wrapped up in its boys from Jersey to give you much actual feel for the period. Onstage you expect the tight focus but on-screen its weird that Sinatras the only outside musician who gets mentioned. No Beach Boys? No Beatles? This is a special Jersey Boys universe crafted specifically for fans -- among whom you can pretty clearly count Clint Eastwood.

Theres a moment in Clint Eastwoods breezy film of the Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons ""jukebox musical"" Jersey Boys that throws a spotlight -- or more precisely a streetlight -- on whats missing. Its in the final scene in 1990 at the groups Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction. Frankie (John Lloyd Young repeating his Tony-winning Broadway turn) tells us (he talks to the camera) that nothing in his life compares to the moment that he and his pals found their sound ""under a Jersey streetlight."" Its a lovely image ... except its not in the movie where theres no special streetlight and the sound just kind of happens. Surprisingly for a musician Eastwood doesnt seem interested in where the Four Seasons sound came from in the Italian appropriation of African-American doo-wop in the origin or unique quality of Vallis exhilarating falsetto. You expect a movie -- unlike a Broadway show -- to give you a little background context peripheral hubbub. But if the show didnt show it Eastwood doesnt either. Narrative chasms one-note characters showbiz cliches dont seem to bother him. As long as he can bring the movie in ahead of time and under budget its all good. To be fair some of it is good very good. Jersey Boys has an easy likable gait. Its Eastwoods most fluid film He gets the swing of the music without fancy editing. Like many ""old masters"" (among them Roman Polanski in the new Venus in Fur) hes mapping out the intersection between theater and cinema. He doesnt want a periphery Graceful self-containment is all. But is it enough for us? The original musical is in four parts each narrated by a member of the group each slant different (though not Rashomon different). For the film (written by the stage shows Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice) Eastwood retains the narration but he doesnt underline the shifts in perspective -- it all seems random. The first narrator has the strongest voice Vincent Piazzas guitarist Tommy DeVito the wiseass gofer for a mob boss called Gyp (the ever-marvelous Christopher Walken) and the one who takes credit for discovering Frankie Valli (born Francesco Castelluccio). He says that in his neighborhood (Newark) you had three choices Join a gang and get killed not join a gang and get killed or pull a Sinatra. He wants to be Sinatra -- or at least to the right or left of Sinatra. Young has played Frankie a zillion times onstage in the last decade but it still seems miraculous when that otherworldly sound comes out of that handsome baby-bland face. I wish the script made a distinction though between a great voice and a great weird voice. In an early scene Frankie does a number with Tommys first group and after a few notes of his piercing soprano a pretty girl at a front table whispers in amazement to her companion. I expected her to be saying ""He sounds like a duck"" but no its more like ""Hes so amazing Im so attracted to him."" Well some people found castrati sexy. And Justin Timberlake. The accepted story of Vallis voice and its peculiar development is this In 1962 in Point Pleasant New Jersey the group ran out of songs but the audience wanted more. Producer Bob Crewe told the New York Times ""Frankie picks up some maracas and does a great imitation of 1940s singer Rose Murphy in a falsetto. It was so clear so crisp."" The article (by Mark Rotella) goes on ""That night [group member and composer Bob] Gaudio went home and wrote a song with that falsetto still ringing in his ears. Sherry took all of 15 minutes to write. It surged onto the charts and hit No. 1."" In Jersey Boys Gaudio (Erich Bergen) writes the song on a bus for no particular reason and he and the others promptly sing it on the phone for their aggressively queeny producer Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle). Two stanzas in Crewe calls to his engineer to set up the 8-track recorder ""Were gonna double Frankies voice Its gonna explode off the radio"" I like the Point Pleasant story better. The thing about Vallis voice is that it could go from a silken soprano to a falsetto screeeech -- and stay absolutely in tune. Try singing ""Ragdoll"" sometime and try to find that point where the rasp as it were hits the road. Erich Bergen plays Gaudio the only member raised in a more affluent milieu and the one who puts the bug in Vallis ear that the two of them should split off from the group. (They did profitably but the name the Four Seasons never lost its luster.) Michael Lomenda is Nick Massi the one who plays his cards close to the vest but lets loose with a show-stopping aria of complaint in his last big scene. Theyre good actors -- broad but this isnt subtle material. Youngs Frankie grows in stature and looks more and more like Al Pacino at the end of The Godfather -- coldly magnetic but with a stubborn loyalty to the group in this case Tommy and his massive gambling debts. Female characters? Theres Vallis wife who has a good tart first scene (before she marries him) and then turns into a drunken hellion; a daughter who suffers from his constant absence; and a journalist girlfriend who looks pretty. The parts are a disgrace but then women have no role in this particular rags-to-riches myth. You can sing like a girl but you should always walk like a man. The palette of Jersey Boys is unnecessarily monochromatic (brown and white) but Eastwoods casual touch keeps it from seeming too self-consciously ""classical."" And he has a wild card in Walken who makes you laugh by keeping to the meter but putting accents on the oddest syllables. (Oh to see him play Shakespeare again)A  The film is a funny mix of formulaic and fresh. The numbers are too polished -- theres no sense of discovery. But the songs and their harmonies are evergreen. Walking out a theater with those tunes in your head you might even think you saw a good movie.

In 1979s searing drama as Walken and Robert De Niro shoot pool in a Pennsylvania bar the hitmakers ""Cant Take My Eyes Off of You"" begins on the jukebox. By the time frontman Frankie Valli and his cohort crescendo Walken John Savage and John Cazale are belting ""I love you baby and if its quite all right..."" The beautiful news is years later that celluloid scene still wows. There is however less encouraging news for those hoping director Clint Eastwoods version of the Tony-nominated musical ""Jersey Boys"" would rival its original in zest and edge. After 134 minutes of Valli amp; Co. Walken amp; Co. still own the title for best big-screen appearance of the Four Seasons. Although a canny bit of casting means Walken as mobster Angelo ""Gyp"" DeCarlo who took a protective shine to Frankie and that voice possesses one of the better moments here too. More plodding than it has a right to be ""Jersey Boys"" recounts the rise of one of pops most successful acts consisting of Valli (John Lloyd Young) Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) and Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) who after being the Four Lovers for a spell took a name thats lasted more than a few seasons. Before the Beatles hit these shores the boys from Belleville and Bergenfield N.J. dominated the pop charts. When songwriter Gaudio comes to the group thanks to the hustle of a Jersey pal by the name of Joe Pesci something clicks. When record producer and co-songsmith Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) signs them they take off. And how Their first three singles ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" and ""Walk Like a Man"" topped the charts. The leads have theatrical bona fides. Young won the Tony for his turn as Frankie. Lomenda and Bergen each played their characters in national tours. These impressive musical theater credentials only underscore how different screen and stage can be same family different species. Of the leads the two who are most comfortable with the cameras peculiar requirements are Doyle and Piazza; each has big- and small-screen experience. When it comes to adaptations we shouldnt demand better so much as hope for ""just as good but different."" ""The Fault in Our Stars"" isnt as edgy onscreen as on the page but its faithful in spirit and often beguiling in execution. Eastwoods longtime cinematographer Tom Stern has a fondness for a sober palette of tans and grays. Here it puts the movie in too somber a mood. Sure theres an earned ""hood in the boys"" aspect to ""Jersey Boys"" which has an R rating due to the language. Massi and DeVito both spend time in stir and DeVito gets in deep with a loan shark. There is a lot of darkness to the behind-the-scenes tale of success. A neglected marriage finally gives way. A child dies. DeVito makes a Faustian bargain that leads to an implosion. The screenplay was written by the Broadway shows dynamic duo Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice which may explain why ""Jersey Boys"" doesnt take better advantage of the movie-making. Aptly if somewhat awkwardly ""Jersey Boys finds its most soulful moment in a movie version of a curtain call. Only its pretty complicated when a movies most rousing moment comes as the closing credits roll.

"Lucky Punks << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The Faded Smile  Next How It Ends Facebook Twitter Print Movies Lucky Punks Clint Eastwoods flat strange but not totally unlikable Jersey Boys by Wesley Morris on June 20 2014 Officially Clint Eastwoods Jersey Boys is -- like the 2005 Broadway musical its adapted from -- about the rise and mild sputter of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. But come on In the opening shot one of the Seasons (lets call him Monsoon) strolls in front of the camera -- his hair done in an airy side sweep his accent fragrant with Eye-talian ""oozes""and ""aws"" -- and starts tawkinta us as he crosses a street in 1951 Belleville New Jersey. It happens over and over in this movie. Someone needs to stop what hes doing in order to turn to the camera and set the scene or explain the times or in that accent say something like ""Ill give Tommy this The guy knew how to throw a party."" Every time it happened I kind of laughed. Oh and a handful of scenes feature a little fixer named Joe Pesci -- not the actor thats the characters name -- who asks someone ""Funny how?"" At some point Frankie comes home from the road to a screaming match with his drunk fed-up wife Mary. Eastwood keeps trying to do Goodfellas and winds up at Olive Garden. This is basically the story of how two-bit gangsters found success as a big 1960s pop act. Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) is the guy who struts first onto the screen. Hes the charismatically one-dimensional ""You want a fucking smack?"" kind of bully that made Andrew Dice Clay possible. But the movie lets you think this is what all young working-class Italians did in the 50s heave giant safes into car trunks. Tommy and his buddy Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) concoct other small-time schemes that get them six months here and six months there. But they manage to keep their lookout Frankie Castelluccio (John Lloyd Young) from going to prison. Hes little and sings with them in a band. While being carted off by a cop Nick turns to Frankie and reminds him to keep working on his voice which can rocket up to a falsettos siren. On their first date Mary (Renee Marino) tells Frankie that if hes going to change his last name he should keep it Italianish. So the moniker he was using Frankie Valley becomes Valli. And thanks to a chance encounter with a freshly repaired neon sign the onetime Four Lovers become the Four Seasons. Courtesy of Pesci (Joey Russo) -- whose namesake was called Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas for what its worth -- Frankie Tommy and Nick find Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) a long wry WASP-y talent. Gaudio becomes the fourth member and cowrites the groups hits a lot them with producer Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) whos presented here as a canny swishy Jersey queen with Park Avenue tastes. Theres an outlandish scene in which everyone sits around Crewes enormous apartment watching Billy Wilders Ace in the Hole. When Kirk Douglas slaps Jan Sterling Tommy says ""I betcha she cries."" Crewe mesmerized by the television replies ""No no. Big girls dont cry."" And Gaudio turns to Crewe with creative disbelief in his eyes. I suppose these movies need a ""Howd they come up with that hit?"" scene. I generally dont like them. But this one I liked. Some of this movie creaks. Some of it like that Ace in the Hole scene is goodish. None of its as embarrassing as it ought to be given the incongruity of genre and director. But this isnt a pure musical which makes it easier for Eastwood to handle production numbers; they happen either on a stage or in a studio. Some of the risk is in building a film around actors who havent made many movies. But the men playing the Seasons are veterans of their respective parts having played them in different productions. Young starred in the original Broadway version (he won a Tony in 2006) and hes not a show-off. In the film his version of Valli seems casually in awe of his own voice. That night that Nick goes to jail he Frankie and a woman theyre friends with break into a church to rehearse and when Frankie starts to sing its the acoustics that make Youngs eyes light up. Its a nice tiny moment. Occasionally when theyre required to be quiet or still the actors recede. But each of them has something -- even Piazza whos stuck with an obnoxious macho part and especially Bergen who does all of his scenes with something like a boyish wink. He seems most at ease with the close-ups. Valli and Gaudio are executive producers so you get why the movie version of Bob is so genially cunning. Tommys gambling and general self-destruction make Frankie seem angelically altruistic and Bob right about everything. Poor Nick should slip through the cracks of Tommy and Frankies drama but Lomenda is too strapping to slip through anything. He uses a thick galoot accent that implies dumbness. Lomenda though is playing years of frustration. As the group falls apart Nick explains his MO during all that time on the road and its so depressing that it recharacterizes the rest of the movie. What did anybody have to sing about? Jersey Boys skates along the surface of stories of guilt and pathology. It tiptoes around Frankies adultery (we never see him cheat but Mary knows) and absentee parenting in order to make him all but a saint. Toward the end hes singing for other peoples suppers. And the movie cant bring itself to find tragedy in that either. Valli and the Four Seasons story might well have been true but as drama its thin and occasionally dull. And because this is a so-called jukebox musical a movie audience doesnt have the spectacle of a production number to look forward to. The soundstage number Eastwood throws in for the closing credits to 1975s ""December 1963 (Oh What a Night)"" makes you wonder whether a bullet was dodged. Thats a frill and apart from a few expertly done facial contortions by Christopher Walken as the classy neighborhood mob boss there are few others. The movies been given the same grim look as most of Eastwoods from the last dozen years. This is how Eastwood approaches the past as memories with faded-out color. The movie is too hard-nosed for nostalgic fun. Or maybe this is as fun or as nostalgic as Eastwood allows himself to get. Regardless its touching in a way. A movie-star director whos built a career around a growling minimalist approach to life (and speaking) has devoted a film to a man who sounds as if Dirty Harry kicked him in the nuts. (Youngs falsetto doesnt pierce the way Vallis did. Its been more than 50 years and still its an alarming note.) Eastwood isnt the first great American director to hit his head on a musical wall. Robert Altman made Popeye. John Huston made Annie. And Jersey Boys isnt a movie that leaves you with the sense that Valli meant to Eastwood what say Charlie Parker did. Eastwood made Bird almost 26 years ago when he was 58. The film didnt work but the atmosphere of jazz had gotten to him. He tried to get inside the music the drug addiction and Parker -- too opaque a genius for easy entry -- kindly spit Eastwood out. The movie was full of cliches but you watch it convinced the man who made it had no idea that they were. As a director it all seemed new to him -- the stage sweats the night sweats -- and it both charged up his filmmaking and mellowed it out. Jersey Boys lacks the immediacy of a live show. Its not just the funereal look. The doo-wop of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons doesnt present the chance for a cinematic jolt the way rock and roll or rap might. It doesnt for Eastwood anyway. I think mid-Atlantic Italian American culture fascinates him. Its as captivating to him as the music maybe more. He likes the accents and admires the hot-bloodedness and loyalty. He admires Martin Scorsese who came from the opposite end of the country and makes the opposite kind of films. Theres a respect paid here that you can sense. Its not nostalgia so much as attempted wish fulfillment. Eastwood might have gone to bed with Goodfellas but he woke up with Dreamgirls.

Its a neat piece of work accomplished partly through the risky trick of having his four leads take turns addressing the camera. They take us through the four seasons of the bands life spring beginnings (handled by streetwise manager-type Tommy DeVito); summer success (brainy songwriter Bob Gaudio) fall foibles (workaday bass-bassist Nick Massi) and deathly winter (bighearted frontman Valli). Especially in the early going the banter serves as an invitation to intimacy with these guys and their neighborhood back in the day. The story is much more about making it than it is about making art; short on surprises but engaging all the same and not without delight.

Entertainment Clint Eastwoods ""Jersey Boys"" Is A Musical That Doesnt Care About Music The oddly inert big screen adaptation could be the start of a whole new genre the musical that doesnt want to be one. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > John Lloyd Young Vincent Piazza Erich Bergen and Michael Lomenda in Jersey Boys Keith Bernstein Warner Bros./RatPac Entertainment ID 3179558 Its possible that no movie about music has ever treated its songs with more indifference than Clint Eastwoods Jersey Boys which opens in theaters this Friday. It feels embarrassed of its own genre which is doubly weird given that the film is an adaptation of the hit Broadway jukebox musical of the same name a telling of the rise of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons as constructed around the groups biggest hits. The songs should be the heart of the damn thing but on screen the signature tunes have been broken up or shrunken down to hurried performances that also often serve as montages to whisk the story along. And the numbers have all been folded into the action -- theyre never anything but realistic whether theyre part of a performance on The Ed Sullivan Show a recording session or a spur-of-the-moment audition. Its the least joyous sort of musical imaginable -- one thats convinced that what you really want is to get back to the talking. As one of cinemas great growlers Eastwoods never been the most effusive guy either behind or in front of the camera. So hes not an expected choice when it comes to helming a musical but hes no stranger to music either. He directed himself as a western singer in 1982s Honkytonk Man and made the Charlie Parker biopic Bird a few years later. And in his side career as a musician he and Merle Haggard even had a No. 1 country hit. But this version of Jersey Boys misses the point in such a fundamental way that its actually kind of fascinating. ID 3177870 View this image > John Lloyd Young and Renee Marino in Jersey Boys Keith Bernstein Warner Bros./RatPac Entertainment ID 3180487 Eastwood treats Jersey Boys like a straightforward gritty biopic about four talented Italian American kids from a tough New Jersey neighborhood. But the screenplay which is adapted by original writers Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice is still scripted like a musical even if the end product tries to extinguish any glimmer of razzle-dazzle. Big events are skimmed over in cursory fashion (one characters daughter is basically introduced in order to die) and characters talk to the camera and speak like theyre in a gaudy exuberant stage production. ""Ya got a nickel? Call your mother. Youre gonna be home late"" says sultry Mary Delgado (Renee Marino) on her first date with young Frankie (John Lloyd Young). In the next scene theyre getting married while Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza the clear standout and the only one of four leads to not come from one of the stage productions) delivers his thoughts on matrimony from behind the wheel of a nearby car. After that Mary only appears to drunkenly scream at Frankie about his failures as a father a shrewish caricature. Goodfellas its not but thats basically the treatment Eastwood tries to give Jersey Boys. Its like taking Chicago and shooting it like Orange Is The New Black -- the subdued approach only emphasizes how stylized the material is. And this approach leads to the regrettable downplaying of some musical moments that should have been sparkling like ""Walk Like A Man"" which ends up sandwiched between a stage performance of ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" and a Christmas party. Meanwhile the intro to ""Sherry"" is sung into a phone. ID 3179845 View this image > John Lloyd Young Vincent Piazza Erich Bergen and Michael Lomenda in Jersey Boys Keith Bernstein Warner Bros./RatPac Entertainment ID 3180563 If Eastwood really was more interested in the story of the Four Seasons than its musical retelling he would have done better to work off a fresh screenplay written for the screen rather than the curiously structured result which skips back and forth in time lets everyone narrate but its protagonist and trims certain plot threads down so much that they barely make sense. But the most frustrating part about the movie is that it closes with the very thing its been desperately short on the entire time. After the ups the downs and the reconciliations Jersey Boys ends with an honest to god song-and-dance number in which all the characters come together to perform ""December 1963 (Oh What a Night)"" on a stylized Jersey street corner. Its gleeful its fun and it has more life to it than anything thats come before. Its inclusion as the credits roll feels almost like a taunt -- obviously Eastwood knows how to do this but he simply didnt want to. Unfortunately the movie he made instead doesnt work as a musical or as a biopic. Its at best a curiosity -- the musical that doesnt want to be one.

"Jersey Boys (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Jersey Boys (R) Clint Eastwoods adaptation of the Broadway smash expands the real-life story. Share Print Save to your profile By Christine Dolen cdolenMiamiHerald.com6/19/2014 Editor rating 3 In the Tony Award-winning musical Jersey Boys -- and in director Clint Eastwoods new movie version of the still-running 2005 Broadway smash -- a successful teen songwriter named Bob Gaudio has a ""eureka"" moment the first time he hears the soaring distinctive voice of Francis Stephen Castelluccio. Or as that singer has been known for the better part of his life Frankie Valli. Listening to Vallis range emotion and vocal pyrotechnics Gaudio knew he had found his instrument the ideal interpreter of whatever hit he could dream up. And once he and Valli partnered with Tommy DeVito and Nick Massi to become The Four Seasons there were so many hits Sherry Big Girls Dont Cry Rag Doll Walk Like a Man Bye Bye Baby Working My Way Back to You Beggin Who Loves You. There were also Valli solo hits like Cant Take My Eyes Off You and My Eyes Adored You. If you happened to be young in the 1960s and 70s if you had a particular radio-friendly Top 40 taste in music Valli and the Four Seasons probably supplied the soundtrack to plenty of your coming-of-age adventures. That built-in nostalgia is part of the reason for the success of Jersey Boys onstage and for its appeal as a movie. But what makes Jersey Boys work for a broader audience is its GoodFellas-meets-Behind the Music content the story of guys who rose from nothing to the top of the charts; its artful blend of fact and interpretive truth-stretching plus its Rashomon device of letting each member of the group tell part of the story from his point of view. And its all woven together by those familiar catchy songs. Oscar winner Eastwood has infused many of his films with jazz his first musical love so his choice of a project with pop-rock and Broadway roots may have seemed like a mismatch. But he made smart choices having Valli and Gaudio around as executive producers tapping Marshall Brickman (who co-wrote Woody Allens Annie Hall and Manhattan) and Rick Elice to turn their musical book into a screenplay and casting mainly actor-singers who had done stage musical as the movies Four Seasons. Just as Valli was the star of the Four Seasons Tony winner John Lloyd Young is the star of Jersey Boys. The diminutive actor with the killer falsetto is almost 10 years older than when he originated the role of Valli on Broadway so the early scenes featuring a 38-year-old Young as the 16-year-old Valli are a stretch. But Brickman and Elices deeper darker screenplay gives the more mature actor plenty to work with in conveying the devastating personal cost of his drive for success. Vincent Piazza (Lucky Luciano on Boardwalk Empire) the only one of these Jersey Boys not to have done the stage musical is domineering and difficult as lead guitarist DeVito the connected guy who fancied himself the bands leader and proceeded to get the Seasons in trouble with the mob and the IRS. Michael Lomenda is funny and frustrated as bass player Massi losing it masterfully when he details the nightmare of rooming with DeVito on the road. Erich Bergen thoroughly inhabits Gaudio who is altogether different from the other three -- more preppy with less of the smalltown Jersey streets focused as an artist-businessman initially more innocent (though not amusingly for long). Oscar winner Christopher Walken is light on menace and long on warmth as the neighborhoods gentlemanly mob guy (and major Frankie Valli fan) Gyp DeCarlo. Joseph Russo is a goofy Joe Pesci (yes that Joe Pesci) the guy who knew Gaudio and Valli when they were both scrambling to make it. As producer-lyricist Bob Crewe Mike Doyle plays the gay hitmaker with a wry smile a bit of edge and a touch of camp. Renee Marino who played Vallis first wife Mary on tour and on Broadway evolves from confident seductress to a woman whose go-to emotion is fury. Cinematographer Tom Stern and production designer James J. Murakami give the period New Jersey (actually a disguised Los Angeles) a mostly muted color palette so that when costume designer Deborah Hopper dresses Valli and the Seasons in red jackets they really pop. Some details on the other hand are fodder for Facebook blooper posts When the group gets arrested for skipping out on a hotel bill they get hauled off to the slammer just after an Ohio State Fair appearance in ""Cleveland."" Actually the Ohio State Fair is held in Columbus (which happens to be my hometown). Eastwood who makes a period cameo in Jersey Boys via an image from his old Rawhide series on a TV screen has made a movie that expands on the storytelling that helped set Broadways Jersey Boys apart from the typical ""jukebox"" musical. If the film audience doesnt get to experience the thrill of watching the faux Valli and the Seasons sing entire numbers live well theres always the next Jersey Boys tour.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 20 2014 at 656 AM updated June 20 2014 at 550 PM comments ""Jersey Boys"" isnt just a movie set in the 50s and early 60s. It looks like a movie from that time too. The muted color palette is pure Ektachrome. Several of the houses and streets are clearly studio mockups. When the characters go for a drive youd almost swear it was bad back projection. Its lovely. And then those songs kick in -- ""Walk Like a Man"" ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" -- and the years melt away. But as deliberately consciously old-fashioned as it sometimes is Clint Eastwoods ""Jersey Boys"" is also often fresh with a self-aware sense of fun that concludes with the whole cast dancing down one of those studio back-lot streets. If you never saw the Broadway musical -- and at this point in this state that might be grounds for expulsion -- its the story of the Four Seasons the Garden State boys who survived bad business decisions breakups and the Beatles to sell records to several generations. Like the show the film also has its characters telling their own stories -- often directly to the camera with a wink a shrug and a whole lot of Jersey attitude. If you have seen the musical though youll recognize many of the actors. Bucking the usual Hollywood practice most of the parts have been cast not with stars but with performers whove already played the roles either on Broadway or on national tour the standout still John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli. The chief exceptions to the original-cast philosophy are Christopher Walken who shows up as real-life mobster ""Gyp"" DeCarlo and Vince Piazza of ""Boardwalk Empire"" who gets the crucial role of the wheeling dealing (and disastrously gambling) Tommy DeVito. Walken is wonderful as always although the role is really superfluous -- hes there chiefly as a symbol for the Jersey mob. But Piazza is terrific -- his character is the first narrator we meet and even when hes off the screen he dominates the film. And although the script is far too fanstruck of the Four Seasons prime movers Valli and Bob Gaudio -- their only sins it seems is that they just cared too much and worked too hard -- Young does another fine job making Valli warmly audibly real. The music helps him too. There are one or two off notes -- the brass section behind ""Cant Take My Eyes Off of You"" is a little tinny -- but its a fun and faithful score and youll be surprised at how many of these songs you know even if you were never a big fan. And while some of the songs are shoehorned in (and having Valli croon ""My Eyes Adored You"" to his kid is just creepy especially since the second line is ""Though I never laid a hand on you..."") the soundtrack still manages to cover the groups long varied history. Of course the movie is a little long too and overly reverent. But natives will love the Jersey references (including someone playing Joe Pesci a DeVito pal and early Four Seasons booster). And if you stay for the final closing-credits curtain-call number -- and you should -- no one will blame you if you join in just a little. Ratings note The film contains strong language and substance abuse. Jersey Boys (R) Warner Bros. (134 min.) Directed by Clint Eastwood. With John Lloyd Young Christopher Walken.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 20 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 20 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Clint Eastwood Written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice Starring John Lloyd Young Erich Bergen Michael Lomenda Vincent Piazza Christopher Walken Classification 14A Year 2014 Country USA Language English Of all the obstacles and indignities overcome by the doo-wop-dipped New Jersey quartet the Four Seasons on their way to pop-nostalgic musical immortality Clint Eastwoods flat-as-a-platter adaptation of Marshall Brickman and Rick Elices Broadway jukebox musical-bio must now be counted as another. However if Frankie Vallis heavenly falsetto can rise above even this sticky cinematic treatment it truly is an instrument of divine power. Most conspicuous of Eastwoods hurdles laid before the band the play and his audience is the movies resolute refusal to do anything than the bare minimum of whats required which is to put his cast - comprised largely of relatively unknown veterans of the nine-year-old Broadway blockbusters touring productions - in front of a camera and shoot. Much as one might wait and hope for a visual correlative of the Four Seasons gravity-defying musical sweetness to emerge Eastwood keeps almost the entire movie - 2 1/4 hours or so worth - grounded in an aesthetic that recalls American network TV circa 1972. Even when confronted with the plays most playful departures from bread-and-butter dramatic exposition - as when the various members turn to the camera to narrate their allotted portion of the bands four historical ""seasons"" - Eastwood opts for the most pedestrian strategy possible The guys simply turn to the camera and well narrate. Trust me youve watched condominium lobby channels that are more exciting than this.While the movie perks up somewhat during the musical numbers and the pitch-perfect clone ensemble (John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito Michael Lomenda as Nick Massi and Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio - are permitted to strut the stuff they were presumably cast for Jersey Boys is otherwise an almost perversely inert movie experience from the sets that feel like a backlot bus tour hairpieces that practically smell of cosmetic glue and a riot of final-act old-age makeup that recalls an especially devoted gathering at a Tim Conway fan convention. To take an especially vexing case in point Eastwoods sole gesture toward star casting is the appearance of the transcendentally eccentric Christopher Walken as the more-than-shady band mentor mob go-between and father figure Gyp DeCarlo. Surely one says to oneself when this pale-eyed spectral oddball walks so welcomely on screen now the movie must take flight only to slump back in ones seat as Walken just keeps on walkin - in one door in most scenes and then straight out another.The real mystery of all this is the constant and all-too-easy imagining of the infinitely better movie Jersey Boys might have been particularly considering the plays built-in supply of mob intrigue plate-smashing kitchen-sink domestic squabbles up-from-the-street showbiz cliches and enough ripe urban Jersey Italianese to give The Sopranos a run for its laundered money. Originally slated to be directed by Jon (Iron Man I and 2) Favreau who might at least have taken greater care to ensure those hairpieces didnt look like freshly fallen squirrel pelts Jersey Boys would have made a tantalizing project for somebody like Scorsese Baz Luhrmann P.T. Anderson or anybody capable of taking the play and cranking its hoarier showbiz conventions into the same state of giddy bubblegum delirium the music itself attains. And that more than anything else is the movies most imponderable and frustrating liability It never reaches the soaring cloud-busting heights of Frankie Vallis otherworldly falsetto and it doesnt even try.

PICTURES View slideshow John Lloyd Young in ""Jersey Boys."" KEITH BERNSTEIN BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Jersey BoysStarring John Lloyd Young Erich Bergen Michael Lomenda Vincent Piazza Christopher Walken Directed by Clint Eastwood Rated R for language throughout Running time 2 hours 14 minutes Playing In wide releaseThe quick hitClint Eastwoods take on Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons is an inexcusably uninspired musical devoid of texture and hit-making excitement. Grade C- The singing may be ""live"" but the atmosphere is dead in Clint Eastwoods version of the Broadway smash ""Jersey Boys."" If you lived through the era when Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons - a swaggering boys group with a falsetto lead singer - became unique rock n roll hit-makers with songs like ""Sherry"" and ""Walk Like a Man"" watching the movie is like entering Mr. Peabodys Wayback Machine and getting stuck in an Eisenhower-era limbo. The pop references are inexcusably sloppy particularly when the movie starts in Belleville New Jersey in 1951. Frankie (John Lloyd Young) for example croons the doo-wop classic ""Silhouettes"" six years before it was written. Far worse the movie never captures the thrill of an explosive youth culture. Eastwood doesnt depict crowds gathering on high school and college campuses as well as in clubs giving startling fresh sounds a widening audience. The way Eastwood directs even adoring teens behave like aging or secondhand fans - as if they were attending ""Beatlemania The Four Seasons Edition."" Speaking of the Beatles Its perverse not to mention them in the movie - or the Beach Boys or a slew of competitors who upped the ambitions of all rock groups. The Beatles even shared their first American label with the Four Seasons Vee Jay Records. In 1964 after both groups moved on Vee Jay dusted off old tracks for a rare two-record set ""The International Battle of the Century The Beatles vs. The Four Seasons."" Eastwood reduces the pop-rock revolution to one virtuoso shot up the front of New Yorks Brill Building revealing musicians strutting their stuff in every window. Eastwood might think hes showing that the groups asphalt-jungle roots made them echo earlier streetwise idols like Frank Sinatra and connect more with urban crowds. (The most amusing set decoration is a dual portrait of Sinatra and Pope Pius XII in a picture frame clock.) But all Eastwood does is make the Four Seaons look like men out of time. His emphases are to put it mildly bizarre. The movie fixates on the boys Jersey street background and link to mob boss Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken). But why waste so much time on rags-to-riches cliches that are also creative dead ends? Eastwood renders the journey out of the alleys taken by Frankie and his oldest partners Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) and Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) in the broadest hoariest most star-flattering manner. Tommy is a semi-talented hustler who cant get the bad-boy blood out of his system while Frankie is a sensitive artist with one vice - his loyalty to Tommy. Their music comes together only after Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) joins the team as a singer keyboardist and writer - and he hails from middle-class Bergenfield. In the one witty moment Gaudio explains a song by invoking T.S. Eliots concept of ""the objective correlative."" More often Bergen limns Gaudio not as a creative whirlwind but as a dork. The film could have used more comic contrasts between the groups primitive roots and the show-biz stratosphere they enter with Gaudio and Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) a flamboyant gay producer-writer with ties to New Yorks cutting-edge art scene. The movie catches a terminal case of Frankie worship rendering simplistic most of his big scenes. Renee Marino fleshes out his smart pugnacious wife with brio - you think shell prove to be a worthy sparring partner for the star. But she gets just one good sequence before turning into a substance-abusing harridan. Not even Lloyd appears comfortable with this films view of Frankie as the epitome of old-school values like loyalty and family love. Hes boyish in a semi-embarrassing way. As for Nick whos meant to be a whiz at harmonies Hed be comic relief if any of his bits were actually funny. Like most of the other actors Lomenda is muted or uncertain. That brilliantly eccentric old pro Walken outshines Lomendas one big rant with little more than a shrug. Marshall Brickman and Rick Elices screenplay like the book they wrote for the musical features all four main characters directly addressing the audience. Elice has compared the structure to Kurosawas ""Rashomon"" the classic film about the elusive nature of truth and I supposed it would be like ""Rashomon"" if ""Rashomon"" were a relay race run by stumblebums. The movie doesnt offer alternate views of reality - you never doubt that Tommys criminal habits will put the group in the hole. The characters offer opinions then simply fill in different parts of the plot. When Tommy says ""Everybody remembers it how they need to"" it sounds like a legal disclaimer not an offhand profundity. Eastwood lets the tone wander all over the place from jarringly jocular prison scenes to tear-jerking family tragedies complete with that over-used device the fateful phone call. The films wooziness wouldnt be disastrous if it swept audiences up in the zest of pop creation. At times Eastwood ignores the groups big ""Eureka"" moments. At what point did they realize that Frankies power falsetto was unique? How did they learn to move like white cousins to the Temptations? At other times he botches them. When record producer Crewe gets the sudden inspiration to ""double-track"" Frankies voice on ""Sherry"" he might as well be in a Popeye cartoon with a light bulb switching on above his head. In his final would-be grand summation Frankie says the groups real ""high point"" came when it was just ""four guys under a streetlamp ... the first time we made that sound."" But Eastwood doesnt show that happening until the movie proper ends. As the closing credits begin the boys sing ""Sherry"" under a streetlamp - an odd choice since they never sang ""Sherry"" in the streets. Then they let loose with an all-out rendition of ""December 1963 (Oh What a Night)"" opening it up for the entire cast. This is what weve missed all along - American youth dancing in the streets to a brand-new sound. It could have been a surprise gift for the audience. Instead its a heartbreaking indication of what might have been.

But the modest charms of Clint Eastwoods thoroughly enjoyable and admittedly lightweight musical ""Jersey Boys"" - adapted from the Broadway show by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice who also wrote this screenplay - lie in the fact that it isnt trying to outdo its many predecessors. Eastwood and the writers understand that weve probably seen the ""Godfather"" movies ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Sopranos."" When the characters in ""Jersey Boys"" break the fourth wall to talk directly to the audience - sometimes mid-song -- theyre acknowledging that were wised up about whats likely to happen in this kind of story especially to a buncha galoots who cant quite leave the projects of Belleville New Jersey behind.Although its setting is highly familiar ""Jersey Boys"" tackles a pop-culture era that remains relatively unexplored at least for contemporary audiences The cusp of the 60s midway between Sinatra and the Beatles in a society still bounded by race gender and ethnicity whose stresses were just beginning to show. As the many people who have seen this show on Broadway or on tour around the world already know ""Jersey Boys"" tells the story - or at least the official story - of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons by far the biggest of the numerous Italian-American vocal groups of the late 50s and early 60s.Since both Valli and Four Seasons songwriter Bob Gaudio (now 80 and 71 years old respectively) serve as executive producers on the film we get hefty doses of the groups biggest hits including ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" and ""Walk Like a Man"" with their alchemical mixture of Tin Pan Alley pop craftsmanship and Vallis peculiar soaring falsetto voice. Those songs have moved beyond oldies into the status of near-antiques and its entirely likely that many people who see this movie have heard them infrequently and have no idea when they were recorded or by whom. Purely as musical performances theyre virtuosic and refreshingly odd mixtures of ingredients that could almost be hits today if set to a different beat. (Eastwood only references this in passing but the Four Seasons were one of the first white groups played extensively on black radio stations and their sound was a key influence on the Motown explosion.)Its also safe to assume that this saga of a chart-topping pop sensation undermined by bad business deals bad debts and mob connections may have been somewhat streamlined for dramatic effect. Theres no question that in this telling Valli (played by John Lloyd Young who created the role on Broadway) and Gaudio (Erich Bergen; ditto) are both the heroes of the tale and the hapless victims of charismatic and feckless Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza of ""Boardwalk Empire"") who founded the group and then did his best to torpedo it. But how closely ""Jersey Boys"" resembles the truth is almost irrelevant at this point and may not be entirely clear even to people who were there. Brickman (who co-wrote several of Woody Allens best films) and Elice have used the material to construct a nostalgic and largely upbeat American fable with an undercurrent of darkness precisely the combination that plays to Eastwoods strengths as a director.Unlike almost all of the films prospective audience Eastwood can presumably remember this era firsthand which may explain why ""Jersey Boys"" feels so much more vigorous than most of his recent movies. (Hes actually several years older than Frankie Valli.) But I dont honestly think thats it. In his latter-day incarnation as a Hollywood A-list director Eastwood makes clean unpretentious mid-budget pictures without a lot of smoke and mirrors. He understands how to work with movie stars having been one for so long and has a reputation for never wasting time and money. Those are all admirable qualities no doubt but theres also the fact that Eastwood never seems to alter his approach based on the script or the subject matter. He obviously likes period pieces historical dramas and sports movies but beyond that he barely appears to notice the details Nelson Mandela J. Edgar Hoover a story of the South Asian tsunami and a 1920s crime saga all receive the same degree of benign neglect. He trusts the material as they say in Hollywood but sometimes the material is crap. (Most of Eastwoods movies since he quit acting have merely been dull but ""J. Edgar"" amounted to a shameful whitewashing of one of the 20th centurys most despicable humans.) You Might Also Like But the laconic Eastwood method - gosh heres an interesting story; see what you folks make of it - is just about right for ""Jersey Boys"" which can simultaneously be enjoyed as a fun summer musical set in a bygone era and a Gatsby-style American tragedy about the impossibility of escaping the past. Brickman and Elice are no fools; they make Piazzas cocksure but doomed Tommy DeVito the central focus. Its Tommy who interrupts the action most often to talk to us (whereas Valli something of a cipher throughout never does). Tommy understands how things work in Jersey He deals in merchandise that ""fell off the truck"" he knows who to talk to when you need a little spending money he grasps that his groups prospects largely depend on their relationship with Gyp DeCarlo (a modest but wonderful role for Christopher Walken) the mobster he drives around town.Tommys perspective is that without his carnivorous street intelligence the pop sensation that was Frankie Valli would never have happened in the first place and at least as this story plays out hes probably right. Tommys the one who spotted a shy diminutive hairdressers assistant named Francesco Castelluccio born to immigrant parents in Newarks densely packed First Ward who had an extraordinary vocal range. Tommy convinces Frankie to treat his gift seriously and seek voice training and Tommy keeps Frankie out of jail taking the fall by himself for a job they did together. When Bob Gaudio comes into the picture Frankie has a clear opportunity to get free of Tommys influence. Not only was Bob a talented songwriter who immediately grasped Frankies potential he was an educated middle-class kid with little or no loyalty to neighborhood customs and ethnic tradition. When a couple of eager bobby-soxers ask him who the girl is in one of his songs Bob explains that shes not real ""Its what T.S. Eliot called the objective correlative."" But as Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) fourth and most obscure of the Seasons tells us during an aside if you think Valli could have cut his old friend loose just because he was a self-destructive lowlife who was likely to bring the whole enterprise down in ruins youre not from Jersey. One could probably describe ""Jersey Boys"" as an easygoing entertainment full of beehive hairdos delightful songs and complicated cocktails all constructed to justify the fact that Frankie Valli spent much of his career as a pop star laboring to pay off enormous debts to gangsters. But we all wind up working for Pharaoh in some capacity and few of us will ever know a moment of pop transcendence like ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You"" (the last big Valli-Gaudio hit in 1967 and maybe the best). When it comes to any larger questions about what was lost or gained and whether Frankie Vallis odyssey was worth it Eastwood throws up his hands. Who knows? Hes made a thoroughly tolerable and non-insulting summer movie for grown-ups; isnt that enough? Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr JERSEY BOYS Vincent Piazza Erich Bergen John Lloyd Young and Michael Lomenda (Keith Bernstein) B- Jersey Boys Genre Musical; Starring Kathrine Narducci Vincent Piazza Christopher Walken; Director Clint Eastwood; Release Date Wide 06/20/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 134; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 6 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Nine years ago Frankie Valli was rescued from oldies-station oblivion with the smash Broadway musical Jersey Boys. The show chronicles the real-life rise-and-fall-and-rise-again of four crooners from the mobbed-up mean streets of 1960s New Jersey who called themselves the Four Seasons and cranked out a seemingly endless string of hit records including the love ditty ""Sherry"" the triumphant ""Walk Like a Man"" and the bouncy bubblegum bop of ""Big Girls Dont Cry."" The songs are timeless. But so are a lot of songs from that Motown and Phil Spector era. What made the Four Seasons magical was Vallis voice -- an impossibly high-pitched nasal falsetto that sounded like a prepubescent angel whod huffed a tank of helium. With Jersey Boys receipts still pouring in on the Great White Way the notion of adapting the musical into a splashy song-and-dance Hollywood biopic must have been too juicy to resist. In fact the only thing that might seem surprising about the Jersey Boys movie is the man squinting behind the camera Clint Eastwood. But the pairing actually makes more sense than youd think. Anyone who saw Eastwoods 1988 Charlie Parker film Bird knows that the guys always been a not-so-closeted hepcat with a discerning set of ears. The biggest problem is that the film written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice never makes a convincing case for why Valli the man or the singer matters beyond the music in the way that Ray and Walk the Line did for Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. Such are the perils of adapting a somewhat one-dimensional stage show. Fortunately Eastwood is far wiser on the casting front. As Valli John Lloyd Young is pretty close to perfection. Thats no shocker really as he won a Tony in 2006 for his portrayal of Valli on the boards. With his slicked-back pompadour and wardrobe of sharkskin suits Young looks more like the late Bruno Kirby than Valli. But when he opens his mouth you believe youre listening to the real deal. He finds every ounce of sweat aftershave and salad dressing that made up Vallis one-of-a-kind voice. As his fellow Four Seasons Michael Lomenda Erich Bergen and Vincent Piazza are equally spot-on even if all of their bada-bing lingo occasionally makes them sound like theyre competing in a Chazz Palminteri impersonation contest. (Both Lomenda and Bergen starred in the stage version as well.) Eastwood has never been the kind of filmmaker to grab you by the lapels or hot-dog with flashy storytelling tricks. You can walk in halfway through just about any of his movies and know exactly where you are. His laid-back traditionalism has always been part of his appeal though. And in chronicling the careers of Valli amp; Co. he charts a predictably linear through-line the bands hardscrabble Italian-American roots which lead them to a sentimental wiseguy (Christopher Walken) who takes them under his wing; their first flirtation with fame; the downward slide of excess money trouble and infighting; and a redemptive third act in which they let bygones be bygones when theyre inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. The movies decades-spanning scope requires the 34-year-old Young to play Valli from age 16 to 60. As good as he is he isnt done any favors by Eastwoods makeup team. Youd think that after all the grousing over Leonardo DiCaprios distracting mugful of old-age putty in J. Edgar the director would have paid more attention to the unconvincing wrinkles and jowls in the final stretch of Jersey Boys. But alas. Still as flat and pitchy as the film sometimes feels what saves it are those nostalgic soaring doo-wop numbers (especially ""Sherry"") and Eastwoods measured doses of directorial playfulness such as when the actors cheekily break the fourth wall and talk directly to the audience as they did on Broadway. This trick doesnt always work but when it does and Valli or one of his bandmates turns to the camera winks and dishes about how the reality of events clashes with what were actually witnessing on screen it gooses the film with a giddy jolt of jukebox electricity.

Entertainment Inc.and RatPac Entertainment Tommy Devito (Vincent Piazza) Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young) and Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) make up the scrappy Four Seasons quartet in Jersey Boys. Keith Bernstein/ 2014 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.and RatPac Entertainment For the final credits of Jersey Boys director Clint Eastwood sends the whole cast into a backlot street to dance to the Four Seasons most recent chart-topper 1976s ""December 1963 (Oh What a Night)."" Hmmm the confused viewer might wonder perhaps this is supposed to be a musical.... The movie is of course derived from the long-running Broadway hit and includes numerous Four Seasons songs. But this adaptation as reworked by original writers Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice adds dialogue and subtracts music. Large sections are devoted to the drama of making it or of keeping it after initial success. Eastwood may not be the projects ideal director. Hes known for working quickly which could explain why parts of Jersey Boys feel undercooked. (The rear projection in car scenes is particularly cheesy.) But the movie is engagingly lively if not always graceful and often surprisingly comic. Music Interviews Frankie Valli On Hair Products And Finding His Falsetto World Cafe Frankie Valli The Falsetto Returns The laughs can be incongruous since the backstory is grim Future Four Seasons Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) and Frankie Castelluccio (John Lloyd Young) are inept small-time criminals in a crummy Newark suburb. Theyre under the protection of a local mob boss (Christopher Walken) a devotee of sentimental ballads although that doesnt keep Tommy and Nick from doing time. Such hits as ""Walk Like a Man"" arrive after Castelluccio renames himself Valli songwriting prodigy Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) joins the lineup and veteran producer Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle teetering on the edge of gay caricature) plumps the arrangements. Crewe and Gaudio are also Jersey boys although the latter is suspect because hes from the right side of the tracks. (Another local future tough-guy actor Joe Pesci plays an amusing role in all this.) Top 40 triumph is scarred by a broken marriage a fatal drug overdose and massive embezzlement among other woes. Some of these developments are foreshadowed; others just pop up as if inserted carelessly from a much longer cut. The stage musical was divided into four chapters each narrated by a different Season. The movie keeps that device but scatters each members commentary throughout the story. You never know when Frankie Bob Tommy or Nick will turn to the camera and start talking to the viewer. Such direct address is a little jarring since the movie often aspires to naturalism. Eastwood includes enough F-words to guarantee an R-rating for a movie about G-rated pop and deploys careful period details and sepia-tinted images to evoke the days before day-glo. And when was that? Onscreen dates identify early scenes as happening in the 1950s but most of the story occurs out of time. Aside from an appearance by the Angels who sing their pre-Beatles ""My Boyfriends Back"" theres little sense of context either social or musical. By the time the Seasons released ""Rag Doll"" in 1964 they occupied the same universe as Motown Bob Dylan and the British Invasion. Yet the movie never hints that the groups doo-wop style had become dated. Still the fact that the Seasons were older than their Top 40 competitors suits the cast some of whom have a couple of decades on the teenagers they initially play. Although Jersey Boys rarely presents an entire Four Seasons number without interruption the music does propel the movie. The group was known for martial drumbeats as well as Vallis stratospheric falsetto and the songs still have juice even when presented in snippets or as background music. But they may not pack enough Jersey swagger to attract moviegoers whose earliest pop memories are of Katy Perry or Justin Bieber.

"Review Jersey Boys is old-school entertainment with surprising edge - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Jersey Boys is old-school entertainment with surprising edge Jersey Boys Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Jersey Boys. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Jersey Boys. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Musics not the only thing that drives Clint Eastwoods Jersey Boys says KennethTuran Because his movies often dance to a violent tune its easy to forget Clint Eastwoods passion for music. He directed ""Bird"" as well as ""Honkytonk Man"" and for the past decade hes also composed many of the scores for his films. But if you think music was the only reason he directed ""Jersey Boys"" you would be missing the point.Thats not to say that the 100-million-record-selling rock anthems by the Four Seasons classics such as ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" ""Walk Like a Man ""Dawn (Go Away)"" and ""Rag Doll"" that are the emotional center of Eastwoods latest film were not a draw for the man who is old enough to remember these tunes when they first came out. An allied musical lure is the crowd-pleasing success of the Broadway musical the film is based on the Tony-winning story of how ""little Frankie Castelluccio"" (a.k.a. Frankie Valli) and his New Jersey comrades created these songs a show still playing around the world and the 13th-longest-running in Broadway history.But to see ""Jersey Boys"" is to feel something else is going on as well. As much as showcasing the music Eastwood has been interested in the parts of the play that recount the entire span of these intertwined lives and show as much concern for the groups turbulent relationships away from the studio as for the music that flowed out of it. If this involvement with what it took for four guys from the mean streets of New Jersey to become international celebrities gives ""Jersey Boys"" a bit of a darker cast than its Broadway predecessor that doesnt stop it from being pleasantly enjoyable. Eastwood as always has simply done things his own way and the result is a leisurely old-school entertainment with a bit more edge than you may be expecting. Related For Clint Eastwoods Jersey Boys a journey worthy of its subjects Steven Zeitchik Since ?Jersey Boys? the rags-to-riches-to-rags musical about Frankie Valli amp; the Four Seaso?ns was first staged on Broadway in 2005 there have been thousands of performances across North America.

Since ?Jersey Boys? the rags-to-riches-to-rags musical about Frankie Valli amp; the Four Seaso?ns was first staged on Broadway in 2005 there have been thousands of performances across North America. In the room at some of these cities sat a certain interested spectator puzzling out what he saw.... (Steven Zeitchik) To do all this most effectively the director went back to the original show in more ways than one. He first returned to the first screenplay ever written for the film by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice who wrote the original show.When it came to casting the only movie star to be found is supporting player Christopher Walken in the role of Jersey mobster Angelo ""Gyp"" DeCarlo a major Frankie Valli fan.Instead three of the quartet of singers in the Four Seasons are played by actors who have been in the play either on Broadway or in the national touring company starting with John Lloyd Young who took home a Tony for actor in a musical for originating the Frankie Valli role. Jersey Boys trailer Trailer for ""Jersey Boys"" Trailer for ""Jersey Boys"" See more videos ""Jersey Boys"" opens with the one newcomer among the actors playing the Seasons Vincent Piazza as live wire Tommy DeVito talking to the camera and letting us know that if ""you want to hear the real story"" about the band youve come to the right place. Namely him.This notion of giving each band member the space to ""remember it how they need to"" is the conceit the film is structured around. And brash expansive high-energy Tommy who explains that of the three ways to get out of their Jersey neighborhood (""you join the Army you get mobbed up or you get famous"") the Seasons hit two out of three is an ideal way to get us into the story.Aspiring musician Tommy works in the barbershop of ""little Frankies"" father where Gyp DeCarlo (Walken looking like death warmed over) is a favored customer. The mobster is an unwavering devotee of the teenage Frankie and his distinctive falsetto sound which he characterizes as ""a voice that is a gift from God.""With the addition of bass guitarist Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) the trio plays small Jersey clubs under an assortment of names before they run into the missing ingredient songwriter and future band member Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) who hears Valli sing and says without hesitation ""I wanted to write for this voice.""Gaudio takes over the narrating chores at this point to be succeeded first by Valli himself and finally by bass guitar Massi the bands quiet man no more.Though it is great to hear the songs this ""Jersey Boys"" doesnt shy away from the story of how unexpected fame unhinged these guys wreaked havoc with their personal lives preyed on their weaknesses and allowed them the opportunity to both succeed and fail on a grander scale than they ever imagined.This sense of a life and its consequences is one of the things that attracted Eastwood. He also connected to the sense that through it all the Four Seasons remained Jersey boys true to the code of the neighborhood no matter what.Twitter KennethTuran------------------------------Jersey BoysMPAA rating R for language throughoutRunning time 2 hours 12 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Column Musical Theater Music Broadway Theater Jersey Boys Breezy musical hits a few flat notes reviews say Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-jersey-boys-review-20140620-column.html,200,jerseyboys23,jerseyboys,latimes

Pictures John Lloyd Young (from left) Erich Bergen Vincent Piazza and Michael Lomenda star in Jersey Boys. By NANCY CHURNIN Follow nchurnin nchurnindallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 19 June 2014 0320 PM Updated 20 June 2014 1243 AM Related Jersey Boys cast talk about bonding performing for Clint Eastwood One of the many pleasures of the screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical Jersey Boys is the absence of Hollywood stars who cant sing.Instead director Clint Eastwood opted for virtuoso stage veterans who inhabit the roles -- four tough guys who transformed themselves into the Four Seasons -- in the way that crystallizes only after hundreds of performances. They give the audience the thrill of falling for fresh faces just as fans of the original singing group did in the 1960s.The result is an inside-the-park home run that doesnt hit the ball over the wall or anywhere you dont expect it to go. But its a solid hit written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice the team who wrote the 2006 Tony Award winner and fueled by the elements that made it so compelling along with others that remain as enigmatic as they were onstage.Plus it adds such a richly detailed look at their world that you can almost smell the meatballs Frankies mother cooks for dinner.Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) and Frankie Castelluccio (John Lloyd Young) are growing up in a rough part of New Jersey when Tommy forms a music group.He sees it as their best shot at getting out of the neighborhood with the other options being the Army or the mob.As Tommy wends in and out of prison Frankie changes his name to Valli and his fabulous falsetto attracts Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) to join as the fourth member. Gaudio teams up with Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) to write some of the hits that would top the charts in the 1960s ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" and ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You.""As in the musical each member of the group takes turns narrating a Rashomon-like tale from his point of view. Tommy doesnt tell you about the money shenanigans that put the group in crisis; those details spill when Nick takes over. Still the feeling that builds is that their differences mixed with friendship helped fuel the harmonies that rendered their songs so irresistible.Young who won a Tony Award as Valli nails the yearning and vulnerability pumping through the talent that made his character a star. Similarly Bergen and Lomenda veterans of touring productions breathe through their characters. Bergens Gaudio is all confidence while Lomendas Massi is a nice guy who is never quite sure he wants to be there. Piazza a star of HBOs Boardwalk Empire pours on the nerve that ignites the musical engine even as the group takes off with a speed that outstrips his ability to navigate.The women depicted in Frankies life remain the big weakness. The actresses while appealing play ciphers ripping his heart without credible insights into their characters. Is it really just because he was on the road so much that Frankies wife Mary (Renee Marino) and his daughter Francine (Freya Tingley) become addicts?Theres a nice star turn by Christopher Walken as the sentimental mob boss who looks out for Frankie because of the way he sings ""My Mothers Eyes."" Theres also a sly moment when Eastwood slips in a cameo of himself in Rawhide on a TV screen. But the rest of the show is about the boys and their music. You wont be able to take your eyes off them -- and thats a good thing. JERSEY BOYS (A-)Directed by Clint Eastwood. R (language throughout). 134 mins. In wide release.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Everybody loves a rags-to-riches story. The joyous new musical ""Jersey Boys"" doubles down on that favorite theme. It follows falsetto superstar Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons from working-class beginnings to Top 40 success back down the charts then up again to comeback glory and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The production (co-written by Marshall Brickman who co-wrote ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan"") has been a Broadway phenomenon since 2005. Whats not to love? The sort-of-true account bounces from mob debts to family friction drug deaths to neat-freak quarrels over hotel towels. And given the groups impressive catalog youre never more than 10 minutes from a showstopper like ""Sherry"" ""Rag Doll"" or ""Walk Like a Man."" Those are some seriously golden oldies. The film adaptation with rock-solid direction from Clint Eastwood (of all people) should delight even millennials who think My Chemical Romance put the Garden State on the music map. This stranger-than-fiction band biography is pop history told in four-part harmony. Like Scorsese-sassy ""Goodfellas"" gangsters hijacking the story each member of the band tugs our sleeve saying ""Dont listen to those guys. Ill tell you what really happened."" We begin with cocky Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) aspiring guitarist small-time crook and the groups self-appointed organizer talking directly to the camera and promising the inside scoop. He gives you the sense that he originated the group right after he hung the moon. He would have been as happy to be the next Al Capone as the next Sinatra. Hes entertaining company in the way exasperating egoists can be but before he can wear out his welcome were introduced to Francis Castelluccio aka Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young). Hes an endearing schlemiel endowed with a thrilling voice. Like bass vocalist Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) the self-described Ringo of the group Valli probably would have settled for weekend gigs in Newark bowling alleys. The group doesnt take off until the arrival of business-savvy songwriting genius Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) who hears Vallis hearty high notes and declares ""I had to write for that voice."" The quartet wends its way through the challenges of launching a recording career. Theres a very funny musical tour through the Brill Buildings hit factory of producers before the boys land with Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) depicted here as a gay party animal with an impeccable ear for sophisticated harmonies. Through it all Valli has the kindly counsel of Angelo ""Gyp"" DeCarlo (the priceless Christopher Walken) a real-life Jersey mob boss whos moved to tears by the singers sentimental crooning. Soon theyre selling records like the Beatles dallying with groupies and enduring the emotional hardships of life on the road. Their troubles ratchet up several notches when they discover that bad boy DeVito has been keeping staggering debts a secret from the others. JERSEY BOYS  out of 4 stars  Rating R for language throughout. The performers aim to give us a bit more sincerity and emotional depth than the typical band of pop impersonators and they deliver. ""Jersey Boys"" is a model of light crowd-pleasing song-propelled pop entertainment. To borrow a line from a Crewe/Gaudio lyric its just too good to be true. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Starring Vincent Piazza John Lloyd Young Steve Schirripa and Christopher Walken. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com June 19 2014 452 p.m. ET 8 COMMENTS The first signs of trouble come early and visibly in Clint Eastwoods film version of ""Jersey Boys."" The bleached-out skies of the opening scene set in Belleville N.J. in 1951 give way to depressingly muted colors--mainly browns and dark reds along with grays and blacks. This proves to be the dominant palette and its apparently an aesthetic choice meant to denote a vanished era. But its a destructive choice that makes everyone look embalmed and one that expresses all too accurately the movies emotional colors. ""Jersey Boys"" the phenomenally successful jukebox musical about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons has been on Broadway since 2005 and has spawned touring companies that are still performing across America and Europe. Its a story told through music and first-person accounts with conflicting points of view of how four ambitious kids three of them from mean-ish streets rose to international fame. The movie stars John Lloyd Young who won a Tony in the Broadway production and hes as startling as ever when he does his own version of Frankie Vallis falsetto; its the vocal equivalent of a laser. The exuberant music retains its appeal--such songs as ""Cant Take My Eyes Off of You"" ""Sherry"" ""My Eyes Adored You"" and ""Walk Like a Man""--even though several numbers are staged unimaginatively and Mr. Youngs voice sometimes sounds disembodied. ENLARGE John Lloyd Young and Renee Marino in Jersey Boys Warner Bros. But the film leans heavily and I mean heavily on the dark side of the groups success-- the early lapses into criminality the scheming and incessant quarrelling the financial follies that get them deeply indebted to the mob. Its ""The Sopranos"" in falsetto register ""GoodFellas"" full of glum fellas and their grating dames. More Reviews Third Person The Last Sentence Mansion Frankie Valli Remembers Home The primary perp of the unpleasantness is Tommy DeVito the groups lead guitarist and one of its founding members. He banishes fun whenever hes on screen upbraiding his buddies with delusional fury or haranguing the camera in direct address. Tommy is played by Vincent Piazza (he was Lucky Luciano in ""Boardwalk Empire"") but the actor shouldnt be blamed for doing the bidding of his director who banishing nuance has populated the screen with many unpleasant characters--Frankies wife his girlfriends a nasty record executive a mob enforcer. Frankie himself isnt unpleasant--hows that for high praise?--but he isnt a vivid presence either. Here again it would be wrong to blame the performer for not getting the help he needed from the director. However remarkable Mr. Young may have been in the original Broadway show (which I didnt see) he lacks experience as a movie actor; in his only feature before this ""Oy Vey My Son Is Gay"" he was notable for his earnestness. All of which raises baffling questions about the tone of the dramatic as opposed to musical direction. Why so cheerless bordering on grim? Was Mr. Eastwood a lover of music and a champion of musicians so seduced by the bleaker aspects of the back story that he neglected the productions grace notes? Whatever the cause the movie turns sour when the singers arent singing. And the first-person accounts dont work at all even though much of their substance comes from the show. (The writers of the musical Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice also did the screen adaptation.) Spoken words can have their own rhythm and musicality but these straight-to-the-camera speeches unleavened by grace or humor keep stopping the wobbly drama in its tracks. The cinematographer was Mr. Eastwoods longtime collaborator Tom Stern. The other two members of the Four Seasons Bob Gaudio and Nick Massi are played respectively by Erich Bergen and Michael Lomenda. Christopher Walken as the mobster Gyp DeCarlo declaims to the slow muffled beat of his own drum. Rewind DVD //Streaming //Download ENLARGE The Bridges of Madison County (1995) Clint Eastwood as director and co-star opposite Meryl Streep turned Robert James Wallers ultrapopular potboiler into a film thats deeply felt and surprisingly musical. The action begins when Mr. Eastwoods Robert Kincaid a photographer assigned to shoot covered bridges for the National Geographic suddenly materializes in the humdrum life of Ms. Streeps Francesca Johnson; shes an Italian war bride whose fires are banked but far from out. Richard LaGravenese wrote the screenplay and ballads by the all-but-forgotten singer Johnny Hartman provide the most distinctive parts of the sound track.

Jazz aficionado Clint Eastwood hates the bubblegum pop-rock noise of all those 50s groups like The Four Seasons as much as I do. And there is nothing fresh special or intriguing about the story of their rise and fall that distinguishes it from all of the other jukebox musicals that pollute the ozone in retro agony. So why did I enjoy Jersey Boys the Broadway show about them that is still running after nine years and why do I like the movie even more? I think its because despite all that crummy doo-wop its a universal American ""anyone can make it"" success story that has uplifting appeal onstage and in Mr. Eastwoods capable hands the joy spreads like apple butter. In almost every Clint Eastwood film the tribulations of the underdog reflect nostalgia for better times. From the heroin-fused genius of Charlie Parker in Bird to the determined girl who slugs it out to be a professional boxer in Million Dollar Baby its all about excelsior for the disenfranchised. So although its not a new story the hopes and hard times of four guys who are one step away from a life behind prison bars and then rise to the top of Tin Pan Alley in the days of tail fins and Top 40s seem like a natural fit. JERSEY BOYS  (3/4 stars) -- Written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice Directed by Clint Eastwood Starring John Lloyd Young Erich Bergen and Michael Lomenda Running time 134 min. Frankie Valli (Tony-winning John Lloyd Young the only member of the original Broadway cast) is arrested for robbery while bandmate guitarist and best friend Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) lands in prison for six months. When he gets out their bass player Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) goes in. Eventually they are joined by Bob Gaudio (a terrific Erich Bergen) a fourth member of the quartet without a criminal record who writes its first hit song ""Sherry."" The movie is not only a standard biopic (formulaic at best) about Frankie and his chart-busting musical act but about how Clint Eastwood the director sees them in the rearview mirror of retrospect. He sure knows his way around a stage mic and a camera angle. When first we meet Frankie and his friends in rough tough Belleville N.J. circa 1951 the rule of the neighborhood is you get killed by the mob you get killed in the army or you get famous and get out. Of course there was also jail where most of Frankies sidekicks were headed or had already been. But The Four Seasons (they got the name from a broken motel sign) were lucky. Frankie was a hairdresser who had a Good Samaritan in a mobster named Angelo ""Gyp"" DeCarlo (a role that surprisingly wastes the talents of Christopher Walken the only big-name actor in the cast). Frankie was a decent kid. Instead of drinking and womanizing like Bobby he married his high school sweetheart Mary and spent his life on the road while swishy record producer Bob Crewe (a funny flamboyant Mike Doyle) exploited his ratchety falsetto voice--an affectation I still find exasperating to the point of madness but an undeniably popular force in making hit records back in the day. (That screeching soprano kept him out of jail paid his bills propelled him to stardom and influenced myriad pop imitators from Little Richard to Little Anthony and the Imperials.) Meanwhile Mary turned into an alcoholic and neglected her children. Who could blame her? Listening to crap like ""Who wears short shorts? We wear short shorts"" day in and day out is to me a form of slow suicide. But the beat goes on. One night The Four Seasons were playing bowling alleys. The next night they were on The Ed Sullivan Show. In time Tommy was dealing in stolen goods from fur coats to cases of contraband Chivas Regal plunging the band in hot water with the I.R.S. the mob and their record label while fighting over arrangements bookings percentages and mounting gambling debts. When they finally broke up it was not because of failure but a result of Tommys mismanagement and greed. Its an old story about the dangers of fame; it spans 40 years and ends with the groups reunion at their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 when they sang together for the first time in 20 years and everything old was new again--for one night only. Written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice the same team that created the original book for the Broadway show and all of its touring companies throughout the world Jersey Boys has intelligence and entertainment value for all ages despite my reservations about songs I consider to be permanently loopy and terminally goopy. The thrill is in the period details the compilation of behind-the-scenes facts (the band was inspired by every source it could find; ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" came from Kirk Douglas slapping Jan Sterling across the face in Billy Wilders iconic film Ace in the Hole) and the directors way of breaking the fourth wall. The power of close-ups brings a warmth and a depth to the story that the play lacked. Mr. Eastwood does his level best to camouflage the cliches but lets face it pop groups are their own cliche which is why they rise from the mud catch on get rich and famous then crash. Thanks to Clint Eastwood the Jersey Boys in Jersey Boys are just a little more fun doing it.

(Credit Warner Bros. Pictures) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT How a group of small-time hoods from New Jersey became Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. Rated R for language. BOTTOM LINE Clint Eastwoods version of the buoyant Broadway musical doesnt hit the same high notes but its a must-see for fans of Valli and the early pop era. CAST John Lloyd Young Vincent Piazza Erich Bergen Renee Marino LENGTH 214 There are two reasons that Broadways ""Jersey Boys"" has been selling out shows since 2005. One is a treasure trove of still-golden hits by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons who straddled doo-wop rock and disco with ""Sherry"" ""Walk Like a Man"" ""Cant Take My Eyes Off of You"" and many others during the 1960s and 70s. The other reason is the fascinating little-known story of how this chart-topping group couldnt escape its New Jersey mob ties even at the height of its success. Clint Eastwoods adaptation re-creates ""Jersey Boys"" almost note for note and line for line right down to the characters who step out of the action to address the audience. Several Broadway cast members make their film debuts to fine effect and the movie is filled with in-the-studio details that will thrill fans of the early pop era. The plays buoyant energy and poignant nostalgia however are somehow missing. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? There are glimmers mostly from Vincent Piazza a swaggering soulful actor (HBOs ""Boardwalk Empire"") who plays Tommy DeVito a small-time criminal and band leader. Its DeVito who taps Valli (a very good John Lloyd Young who won a Tony for the role on Broadway) for his soaring gender-bending falsetto. Also reprising their stage roles are Michael Lomenda as bassist Nick Massi and Erich Bergen as the uptight but brilliant songwriter Bob Gaudio whose yearning chords turned Vallis voice into a pop Stradivarius. Christopher Walken cakewalks as the avuncular mobster Gyp DeCarlo who repeatedly bails the band out of hot water. At its best ""Jersey Boys"" moves and grooves like a musical ""Goodfellas"" but it can also be as exasperating as a scratched-up LP. Just when it finds its rhythm it misses a beat. The dialogue that sounded so sharp on the stage now sounds well stagy while the dramatic scenes (Renee Marino and Freya Tingley play Vallis wife and daughter) feel obligatory. Eastwoods approach falls somewhere between Rob Marshalls splashy ""Chicago"" and Taylor Hackfords formulaic ""Ray"" and the result is an unconvincing air of half-reality. The story is still compelling though and so are all those songs. 105 MoviesRafers review Jersey Boys PLOT How a group of small-time hoods from New Jersey became Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (language throughout) CAST John Lloyd Young Vincent Piazza Erich Bergen Renee Marino LENGTH 214 BOTTOM LINE Clint Eastwoods version of the buoyant Broadway musical doesnt hit the same high notes but its a must-see for fans of Valli and the early pop era.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1011 p.m. EDT June 19 2014John Lloyd Young stars as Frankie Valli in the musical Jersey Boys from director Clint Eastwood.(Photo Keith Bernstein Warner Bros. Pictures)The catchy hits by The Four Seasons are indelible but Jersey Boys the drab movie based on the Broadway musical about those tunes is sadly forgettable.Everybody remembers it how they need to asserts the tagline. Yet the only memorable aspects of the movie about the formation success and breakup of the 1960s pop group are those falsetto-tinged songs that burrow into ones consciousness and refuse to let go. All else fades away (  out four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide).What was blandly charming on stage -- characters addressing the audience ultra-broad jokes and showbiz patter -- feels contrived cheesy and cliched onscreen.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYMORE USA TODAYs guide to summer moviesThe gee-whiz innocence of Frankie Valli (played by John Lloyd Young the Tony-winning originator) worked fine in the musical because it suited the rousing melodic renditions. But in the expanded screen tale Frankies pal and bandmate Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) comes off as a sociopath rather than a two-bit hustler. The movie tries to have it both ways seeking to be a more honest R-rated portrayal of the pop band while retaining the groups clean-cut image. What emerges comes off like a slightly edgier more harmonic episode of Happy Days.While the Four Seasons songs marked by Vallis signature falsetto are fun upbeat and distinctive the groups rise and fall seems overly familiar. Guys from the wrong side of the tracks get together struggle for a while then hit pay dirt. Soon in-fighting and clashing egos get in the way and the band disintegrates.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Four young men from the wrong side of the tracks in New Jersey come together to form the iconic 1960s singing sensations The Four Seasons. VPCThe film lacks a sense of how they fit into the 60s pop music scene. They sounded like a novelty act so how were they regarded by their peers? Their saga seems to exist almost in a vacuum.Like the play the film offers a series of vignettes vaguely connecting the songs rather than a bona fide narrative. We never see the band members rehearse nor get a sense of their commitment or love for music. Sure they want to escape their working-class confines but do they actually enjoy singing their popular harmonies? The film doesnt provide the answers.Their portrayals are sadly caricatured Valli has the voice of an angel. Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) writes the songs and has some business savvy. Tommy is the seedy hustler and Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) is the guy who went along for the ride. Like Young Bergen and Lomenda reprise their stage roles but they adhere too closely to a bombastic musical theater style and fail to adapt to a subtler mode necessary for the screen.Christopher Walken plays local mobster Gyp DeCarlo as a benevolent defanged version of a tough guy.The films creepiest moment comes when Frankie sings My Eyes Adored You -- clearly a ballad for an unrequited love -- as a lullaby to his 7-year-old daughter Francine (Elizabeth Hunter). The line ""Though I never laid a hand on you"" feels strikingly inappropriate when sung to a little girl.Clint Eastwood seems the wrong director for the material. His expertise lies in more weighty projects such as Letters from Iwo Jima Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby. His heart just doesnt seem to be in this film.His use of desaturated color seemingly an attempt at grittiness serves only to undercut the lively music. Ordinarily Eastwood has a sharp command of subject time and place but this music-industry tale feels perfunctory even dutiful. Bogged down by lackluster pacing the film strains as it goes on too long.On the plus side the infectious songs sound essentially identical to the way The Four Seasons sang them.As an aurally nostalgic experience Jersey Boys delivers. But as a film interpretation of a smash stage musical it falls flat.. 106 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 20 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1qiVGsa",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/19/jersey-boys-review/9684467/,200,jerseyboys31,jerseyboys,usatoday

Entertainment Inc. and RatPac Entertainment. Clint Eastwoods film of the Broadway smash about the Four Seasons stints on the glorious music and goes heavy on the Goodfellas rancor Jersey Boys opened on Broadway in October 2005 won four Tony Awards (including Best Musical) and is still going strong after 81/2 years. Essentially a ""legends"" tribute plus some insider gossip like the current Tony champ Beautiful The Carole King Musical the Four Seasons show hooked audiences with the glorious caterwauling of lead singer Frankie Valli as originally and expertly impersonated by John Lloyd Young (also a Tony winner) and then dished out the more or less true behind-the-music story of four North Jersey guys godfathered by a Mob boss. This canny mix -- the Falsetto meets the Sopranos -- guaranteed a bridge-and-tunnel stream of Garden Staters ready to sing along to some of the most infectious and enduring pop of the 1960s. Now its a movie scripted by the shows writers Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice and directed by Clint Eastwood who might seem just the man for the job. The 84-year-old star-auteur composed the scores for seven of his films. He directed the Charlie Parker biopic Bird (with Forest Whitaker) and the 2003 documentary Piano Blues. In Play Misty for Me his first film behind the camera he took the role of a disc jockey spinning classic jazz and he was a traditional country singer in Honkytonk Man. (SEE The Legend of Clint Eastwood) So why is the Jersey Boys film a turgid botch? Eastwoods resume hints at a reason. His affinity is for American standards as improvised on piano or guitar by indigenous artists in smoky nightclubs not for the tightly wound impeccably pounding songs that Bob Gaudio and Bob Crewe wrote for the Four Seasons. Eastwood is mature jazz; theyre teen pop. When the movies Gaudio (Erich Bergen) watches a 1961 episode of Rawhide with Eastwood romancing Gloria Talbott you realize that Eastwood was already in his 30s too old to feel the Seasons seismic jolt. Having little emotional connection to the source music Eastwood emphasizes the backstage struggles of the individual members founder and serial criminal Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) bassist and fellow felon Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) Valli (Young reprising his stage performance) and odd man out the middle-class Gaudio. Eastwoods movie models include his own Mystic River another story of anguished bonding among proletarians with eccentric accents and Martin Scorseses Goodfellas including an appearance by the young Joe Pesci. At 2 hr. 14 min. the movie is nearly as long as the Jersey Boys show but with much more talking and a lot less singing. If you want to hear all the songs buy the greatest-hits album. Seriously buy the album or listen to the original songs on an iPod or on YouTube. Produced by Crewe (played here as a purring gay dandy by Mike Doyle) they sound much crisper than they do in the film which uses snippets of many numbers and adds odd flourishes to others like the trombone blurts in Vallis solo hit ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You."" The show expertly duplicated the Seasons sound and Youngs raspy falsetto filled the large theater. In the movie the star is not always in his best voice. Since Piazza (Lucky Luciano on Boardwalk Empire) is not a professional singer and since Eastwood uses most of the songs as filler he may as well have had his actors lip-sync the Seasons tracks. But he either couldnt hear the difference or just didnt care. (WATCH The trailer for Jersey Boys) Shot by cinematographer Tom Stern in a predominantly desaturated palette as if New Jersey couldnt afford color in the late 1950s the movie sets up the antagonism of Tommy a born hustler who keeps trying to con gangsters even after the Seasons hit pay dirt to Gaudio who just wants to write for Frankies voice. Their underworld mentor is Gyp DeCarlo a benevolent mobster moved to tears by Frankies rendition of ""My Mothers Eyes"" and played by Christopher Walken with a good less quirk than he brought to his conversation about skunks and otters on The Daily Show last week. Eastwood doggedly tracks Frankies bumpy marriages to local girl Mary (Renee Marino) and journalist Lorraine (Erica Piccininni) and his frayed relationship with daughter Francine (Freya Tingley as a teenager). In an interminable third-act face-off Gyp presides over the breakup of the band with each member getting a verbal aria to spill the resentments that have boiled for years. As with so much else in Jersey Boys they shouldve been sung. The curious thing is that the movies theme -- boys from the wrong side of the Hudson striving to make it in the big city -- underlies many Four Seasons songs. ""Big Man in Town"" ambitious poor boy dreams of approval from a rich girls parents. ""Dawn (Go Away)"" poor boy selflessly tells rich girl shed be better off with her own kind. ""Rag Doll"" rich boys parents keep him from courting the poor girl he loves. Class divisions matter in these proletarian ballads about wanting and hurting. The Jersey Boys show attended to the groups personality clashes and still had room for 34 numbers half of them Seasons hits the others filling in the periods pop ambiance. But Eastwood thinks audiences are more interested in the anomaly that four people who made beautiful music had lives with little harmony. (READ Jersey Boys on Broadway -- The Falsetto and the Sopranos) The movie is much better at dramatizing the inner workings of the music business. A vertical tracking shot up the front of the Brill Building shows different singers -- country rockabilly jazz -- auditioning for producers. (Even this nice shot is a bit off in the late 50s the hopefuls should have been doo-wop quartets girl groups and balladeers.) Some of the hoariest biopic cliches play beautifully like the view of a company sign that gives the group its name or the evening when Gaudio new to the group plays his composition ""Cry for Me"" on the piano -- by the end each of the three skeptics is singing along in perfect four-part. Each member of the group narrates a section of the film and Frankie gets the last word. ""When everything dropped away and all there was was the music"" he says ""that was the best."" The music was the best thing about the Four Seasons and the central asset of the Jersey Boys show. By concentrating on the groups personal wrangling to the near exclusion of their songs Clint Eastwood has jettisoned the joy and made this a one-Season movie winter in New Jersey. And man thats bleak. Correction The original version of this story misspelled Rick Elices name. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Jersey Boys Video Rated R  132 minutes  2014 The beloved boomer-nostalgia musical which traces the rise and fall of the chart-topping Four Seasons comes to the big screen under the unlikely tutelage of Clint Eastwood. His treatment of the material is decidedly prosaic perched midway between cold realism and showbiz fantasy the colors are muted where they ought to be gaudy and even the irrepressibly catchy songs come and go without much impact (the only one accorded the proper razzmatazz is Frankie Vallis monster solo hit ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You""). The scenes detailing Vallis family problems are so perfunctory you wish Eastwood had just dropped them though the emerging conflicts among the four singers are nicely handled; this isnt the movie it should have been but it serves its purpose as a souvenir of the stage show.

"Jersey Boys hits the high notes and a few low ones review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesJersey Boys hits the high notes and a few low ones reviewClint Eastwoods Jersey Boys entertainingly recreates the acclaimed stage show about pop crooners Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 19 2014Jersey BoysStarring John Lloyd Young Vincent Piazza Christopher Walken Erich Bergen Mike Doyle and Renee Marino. Directed by Clint Eastwood. 134 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. 14AYou may well wonder why the man who played Dirty Harry would want to make a movie about pint-sized falsetto singer Frankie Valli and his Four Seasons pop group.If Clint Eastwoods Jersey Boys fails to answer this musical question neither does it make you resent the time taken to explore it. The film entertainingly recreates an acclaimed stage show that you can now see for the price of a multiplex ticket rather than a Broadway one.Article Continued BelowInterview Eastwood explains what drew him to Jersey BoysFrom left John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito and Michael Lomenda as Nick Massi in Jersey Boys the movie version of the original stage musical.  (Keith Bernstein / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)  As a bonus it offers a little more depth than the jukebox musical. Eastwoods affinity for outsiders and his deep love of music -- he composed the scores to most of his recent movies -- gives him a unique perspective on the Four Seasons a band never really of its time and place.Valli and his mates made most of their close-harmony hits in the 1960s rock era with a sound rooted in early 50s vocal pop. They hailed from a Mob-dominated New Jersey neighbourhood where -- as were told right off the top -- they could just as easily have ended up dead in the trunk of a car rather than live on stage. Everything they did was an act of rebellion even if they didnt realize it.So far so interesting and Eastwood hits a casting high note by choosing mostly veterans of various Jersey Boys stage incarnations. Theyre led by Tony-winning John Lloyd Young as frontman Valli the role Young created on Broadway nearly a decade ago. Young 38 can crucially hit all those falsetto notes in chart-bopping tunes like ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" and ""Walk Like A Man"" and hes a reasonable facsimile of Valli in face and stature even credibly playing him at age 16 in the movies first act.What Young lacks are the acting chops that could make Jersey Boys even more of a character study something along the lines of what Kevin Spacey brought to the role of Bobby Darin in his 2004 musical biopic Beyond the Sea. Similar strengths and limitations are evident in other Jersey Boys roles Four Seasons guitarist/catalyst Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) bassist Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) keyboardist/songwriter Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) and producer/lyricist Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) the latter deserving extra kudos for largely avoiding stereotyping a gay character. Eastwood and screenwriters Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice (the shows original book writers) also retain the stage device of having the characters speak directly to the audience. While it works well enough heres one area where a departure might have been advisable especially since DeVito does most of the talking and the device is abandoned for much of the latter part of the film.More troubling in dramatic terms is the heavy emphasis on inter-band friction caused by DeVitos squandering of the groups financial resources in gambling debacles that left them all indebted to the mob. Theres never any real sense of this threat being more than an accounting headache especially with neighbourhood crime kingpin Angelo ""Gyp"" DeCarlo being played by Christopher Walken as the most lovable of rogues -- he bursts into tears at the sound of Vallis ""voice of an angel.""The more emotional issue of families torn by a life on the road gets less than optimal attention a failing that particularly hurts the films female characters. Renee Marino starts out as a tiger but turns shrewish as Vallis first wife while the singers troubled daughter (Freya Tingley) remains a sad cipher throughout.The picture also would have benefited from one or two more complete production numbers since much of the joy of Jersey Boys is watching the cast do a convincing take on the Four Seasons in their finger-snapping prime.Also missing is any kind of context to the bands place in the showbiz firmament. Apart from passing references to fellow Jersey hero Frank Sinatra and one throwaway line about Ringo Starr theres no comment about such musical contemporaries as the Beatles Rolling Stones and Beach Boys. Its as if the Four Seasons were the only stars on the pop charts.On the plus side we get to see close-up the creative process at work as a group of blue-collar Italian-Americans work through squabbles writers block and dodgy nightclubs and state fairs to build a songbook of lasting resonance. Sometimes it was all down to pure dumb luck.Whod have guessed for instance that ""Walk Like A Man"" was inspired by the sight of Kirk Douglas slapping Jan Sterling in the face in Ace in the Hole the 1951 Billy Wilder film that excoriated celebrity news?Also hitting all its marks is the look of Jersey Boys. Tom Sterns desaturated colour cinematography renders authentic tones of the 1950s and early 60s. A fleet of cool vintage cars provides the dual benefit of removing the story from its stage confines while also giving auto hounds some eye candy.One artistic choice simply baffles. As Eastwood rushes towards a conclusion that takes in Vallis solo years and more recent band reunions/reconfigurations he skips mention of the singers 1978 smash success with the title track to the movie Grease. Ironically Valli did it as a disco number in accordance with the dance craze of the time rather than as a song from the 50s the era the movie celebrates. For once in his career Valli was musically up to date but the film ignores this anomaly.Eastwoods Jersey Boys may not completely serve either real life or the stage original but it comes with its own ""get out of jail free"" card for any historical or dramatic inconsistencies with DeVito once again doing the talking.""Everybody remembers it the way they need to right?"" he says to camera.Fair enough and if you fondly recall both the music of the Four Seasons and the Jersey Boys stage show chances are youll like the movie too.Read more about Clint EastwoodThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Fuhgeddaboudit By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Jun 19 2014 (...) The first film I ever previewed was the rock bio ""The Buddy Holly Story"" when I was a student at the University of Pennsylvania. I was 19 and a natural-born Jersey boy so I thought I knew more about movies and music than the studio that sponsored the focus group. With heaps of relish I told the surveyors that the film was the most ineptly directed dull and historically inaccurate thing I had ever seen.Now that I have suffered through 134 minutes of ""Jersey Boys"" I owe apologies to every music-themed movie at which Ive lobbed rotten tomatoes from ""Grease 2"" and ""Glitter"" to ""Rent"" and ""Rock of Ages."" If I live to be as old as Clint Eastwood I will never witness a more turgid tedious and tin-eared assault on popular culture than this gaseous misfire.Eastwood is 84. Frank Valli and the Four Seasons the basis for the Broadway musical which Eastwood has adapted peaked in popularity more than 50 years ago in that dry gulch between Elvis and the Beatles. So nobody could reasonably expect a lollapalooza of liberating energy. But this petrified fiasco makes a matinee in Branson look like a melee in Berlin. Eastwood is a much-revered master of action films yet theres no virtually no movement in this sepia-toned museum piece. Circa sometime in the 50s teen Frankie (John Lloyd Young) joins jailbird Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) in a Jersey doo-wop group. Frankies got a great falsetto and stereotypical Italian mobster Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken) wants to make Frankie a star. Yet theres little sense of artistic commitment or personal toll. While the four band members occasionally face the camera to narrate the decade-long roller-coaster ride their parents wives and children are as sketchy as the calendar. (Dont bother looking for references to black people JFK or the Vietnam war because this movie takes place in Fantasyland.) The Four Seasons fortunes rapidly improve with the arrival of keyboardist Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) who writes most of the groups hit songs (""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" ""Walk Like a Man""). A fatal flaw of the movie is that Gaudio/Bergen is so much more interesting than Valli/Young a pipsqueak who never holds our attention. Im swearin to God the musical performances are worse than karaoke night at the Bowl-a-Rama.But the worst thing about this multifaceted failure is the Oscar winner behind the camera. Where there ought to be a director theres nothing but an empty chair.

Musical biopic of singer Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. Director Clint Eastwood (214). R Language violence. Area theaters. If youre already a Frankie Valli fan -- or even better a fan of the Broadway musical ""Jersey Boys"" -- its a safe bet youll love director Clint Eastwoods new biopic. If not well a 12 ticket is still a lot less risky than a 200 seat to the show. And Eastwood does avoid the staginess of many theatrical adaptations if not the stodginess of a predictable rise-and-fall tale. The Four Seasons as depicted in Clint Eastwoods ""Jersey Boys."" From left Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli and Michael Lomenda as Nick Massi. (Keith Bernstein) From the mid-1950s on the Jersey-born singer (played by John Lloyd Young) experienced all the ups and downs required to earn his own glimpse behind the music. As interpreted by screenwriters Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice a mobster patron (Christopher Walken) protected Valli from local goodfellas his best friend Tommy (Vincent Piazza) revolved in and out of jail and the singers resentful wife (Renee Marino in a thankless role) and troubled daughters barely knew him. Michael Lomenda John Lloyd Young Erich Bergen and Vincent Piazza in the recording studio in ""Jersey Boys."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) The movie focuses primarily on music and the mob. Marriage is an afterthought as are other aspects of Vallis personal life. The highlights are usually the songs from the early success of the Four Seasons ""Sherry"" to late hits like ""December 1963 (Oh What a Night)."" Some are woven into the action carefully; others seem to be dropped in simply because theyre required. As a result we go through the movie appreciating various elements without getting the sense of a greater whole. In ""Jersey Boys"" Christopher Walken (second from left) plays Frankie Vallis mobster patron. Also picture (l.-r.) are Vincent Piazza Donnie Kehr and Erich Bergen. (Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures) As the most comfortable performer among this inexperienced cast Walken brings a crucial maturity. In contrast Young seems to have been hired primarily for his uncanny falsetto. He earned a Tony for originating the role on Broadway. Onscreen though hes never convincing as a star. He neither embraces nor breaks free of Eastwoods purposefully old-fashioned style. ""Jersey Boys"" tells the story of the Four Seasons from their beginning in the mid-1950s through their 1960s success and beyond. (Keith Bernstein) Young is shown up by at least two of the Four Seasons. Erich Bergen is wryly compelling as Bob Gaudio the groups songwriter and a seemingly staid guy who turns out to be a brilliant businessman. (The real Gaudio is along with Valli an executive producer of the film.) Best of all is Piazza who adds a desperately needed edge within this respectful tribute. Youngs bland Valli never really grabs us the way he should. But when Piazza smolders and glowers as Tommy the groups fiery wild card we cant take our eyes off of him. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews jersey boys clint eastwood erich bergen the four seasons bob gaudio vincent piazza tommy devito john lloyd young frankie valli michael lomenda nick massi christopher walken musical drama Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The film tells the story of the Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. (Jayne Orenstein/The Washington Post) By Stephanie Merry June 19 2014 Follow stephmerry Movies of musicals are usually a crash course for Hollywood A-listers. Actors not known for their singing skills are suddenly expected to warble their way through a story. You see Meryl Streep shimmying and strutting to Abba in ""Mamma Mia"" and Renee Zellweger hitting the high notes in ""Chicago"" Johnny Depp cutting hair and throats while channeling Sondheim in ""Sweeney Todd"" and Hugh Jackman making us weep as Jean Valjean in ""Les Miserables."" And what of the Broadway superstars who gave the musicals the cachet to warrant the film adaptations? Theyre still performing night after night since their names arent recognizable enough to score big box office numbers -- much less get proper introductions at the Oscars (ahem Adele Dazeem). ""Jersey Boys"" is an exception. The most recognizable stars in Clint Eastwoods adaptation of the Tony-winning play about the 1960s band the Four Seasons are Christopher Walken and that guy from ""The Sopranos"" (who upon post-movie Googling turns out to be Steve Schirripa). John Lloyd Young plays Frankie Valli a role the actor originated on Broadway. He won a Tony for his work but this is only his second feature film after a 2009 romantic comedy called ""Oy Vey My Son Is Gay "" Of course who in Hollywood could possibly mimic Frankie Vallis formidable falsetto? Just imagine James Franco trying to get through ""Big Girls Dont Cry."" On second thought dont. Young might not be a household name but he can sing and act onstage and onscreen. And the rest of the cast is also made up of musical theater talent Michael Lomenda who plays the deep-voiced Nick Massi and Erich Bergen as singer-songwriter Bob Gaudio both return to roles they played during the shows first national tour. The fourth band member Tommy DeVito is played by ""Boardwalk Empire"" regular Vincent Piazza. The cast list isnt the only way Eastwood stays true to the original incarnation. Seeing the movie onscreen is a lot like seeing it in a playhouse -- and thats okay. After all the story is dramatic with its tale of kids from a rough neighborhood who shoot to fame with catchy hit after catchy hit but cant quite keep it together. Plus the dialogue is witty and the music is phenomenal. There isnt a lot of fancy camera work or special effects and the movie even retains the way characters directly addressed the audience in the play. This particular gimmick feels a little unnecessary in the adaptation. Facial expressions which arent always visible to a theater audience can do a lot of explaining in films When Bob hears Frankie sing for the first time for instance a look of astonishment comes over his face before he turns to the camera and says ""After 30 seconds I know I need to write for this voice."" But we figured that out already. The movie like the play also overstuffs the plot. Valli suffered a harrowing family tragedy that makes its way into the narrative. Yet with so much attention paid to the band and so little to his personal life up until that point the misfortune feels shoehorned into the story as a way to exhibit the hero hitting rock bottom. Overall though fans of the play will be pleased. And for those that love the Four Seasons music but havent made it to the play you can put your fear of missing out to rest. This is a much more affordable way to very nearly re-create the experience.   1/2 R. At area theaters. Contains language. 134 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"Jersey Boys movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Jersey Boys  1/2 Video Jersey Boys adaptation muddled in style but not terrible Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and Tribune theater critic Chris Jones compare the Clint Eastwood directed adaptation to the Broadway smash. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips and Tribune theater critic Chris Jones compare the Clint Eastwood directed adaptation to the Broadway smash. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""Jersey Boys"" the movie is a different more sedate animal than ""Jersey Boys"" the Broadway musical. Often this happens when a stage success comes to the screen even with many of the same performers and artistic team members on board. Changes are made; ardent fans of the original are variously pleased or disappointed. And in this case those who missed the theatrical edition of the tale of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons -- how they found their sound and wrestled with temptations -- may wonder what the fuss was about.The hits keep on coming ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" ""December 1963"" and many more including that uniquely addictive gush of romantic 60s desperation ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You."" They may be enough. Full of genial showbiz cliches and mobbed-up sweeties its an easy movie to take. It is also an uncertainly stylized one with a drab sense of atmosphere at odds with the materials punchy theatrics. Like the recent film version of ""August Osage County"" (now theres a musical) ""Jersey Boys"" labors under a case of directorial miscasting that of legendary filmmaker Clint Eastwood at the helm of a whiz-bang jukebox tuner.Onstage the show was nothing if not speedy under the direction of Des McAnuff. The musicals librettists Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice adapted it for the screen retaining (though downplaying) the basic structure allowing each of the Four Seasons a chance to relay the groups origin myth his way. It begins in Belleville N.J. in 1951 and ends with a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction complete with unfortunate old-age makeup in 1990. Valli and songwriter Bob Gaudio serve as executive producers of the film so you know theyre going to come off extremely well in relation to the other two Nick Massi and Tommy DeVito. What did the Four Seasons have that so many other groups lacked? Start with Vallis falsetto which in its heyday sounded like a duck-and-cover emergency siren played at 78 rpm. ""Jersey Boys"" argues that Vallis success like Sinatras in a separate imperious corner of superstar mythology was all about the working-class Jersey roots and a natural overlap with the local capos.""There were three ways out of the neighborhood"" DeVito says at one point to the camera. ""You join the Army and maybe get killed; you get mobbed up maybe get killed that way. Or you get famous. For us it was two out of three.""Its a pleasant shock to see the opening credits of an Eastwood film scored to pop music with some energy instead of his usual forlorn solo piano. The story skates through the decades. As the Four Lovers the boys are stuck with backup vocal chores for better established artists. Then naming themselves after a bowling alley the Four Seasons hit pay dirt with ""Sherry"" on ""American Bandstand""; Valli juggles a nagging wife and needy mistress (the womens roles are neither central nor nuanced here even with additional screen time); DeVito nearly sinks the group with debts to the mob represented by Gyp DeCarlo a real-life fan from the beginning. As the kindly underworld kingpin bearing hardly a whiff of authenticity Christopher Walken strolls off with every scene hes in.Valli goes up then down then up and the road along the way is paved by drugs heartbreak personal tragedy. Were left with a sense of conflicting versions of events smoothed over by the harmonic convergence of a history-making quartet. Working with his usual collaborators chiefly cinematographer Tom Stern (king of the desaturated slightly sad color scheme) and production designer James J. Murakami the director plugs along following one narrator then another hitting the story points and moving on. The casting of relative unknowns many from stage incarnations of ""Jersey Boys"" helps in some cases hurts in others. John Lloyd Young won the Tony Award for his Frankie Valli but on screen hes a tentative presence despite a formidable vocal range and powerful falsetto. Far better is Erich Bergens Gaudio a comfortable and natural personality who doesnt get lost amid the swirl of years and setbacks and triumphs. Some scenes are frankly theatrical such as the hardship tour of the famous Brill Building full of hardened veterans impervious to raw talent. (See ""Singin in the Rain"" for an earlier example.) Other segments are stiff Hollywood soundstage artifacts all the way such as the boys early smash-and-grab robberies for the local gangsters. Others still are played out more or less realistically until were hit with a deliberately fakey bit of rear-projection. Eastwood never pushes his approaches too far in any one direction. Those who show up for the songs and only the songs probably wont mind how theyre treated visually.Another better-than-average jukebox musical ""Mamma Mia"" turned into a 600 million-grossing movie not because it was a great film (or even a good one) but because it had irrational exuberance in spades and in tune with the appeal of ABBA. ""Jersey Boys"" is rationally exuberant to a fault. The personalities feel curiously small within the story. This was the case onstage as well -- McAnuffs musicals tend to clobber performers with a ton of visual competition -- but his intentions were clear and ultimately fruitful pace the thing as McAnuff put it in one interview like ""a bat out of hell."" Moderately entertaining Eastwoods film marches to a more methodical drummer. I suspect its commercial fortunes are unlikely to rival that of the stage version which has made more than enough in its 10-year life span (since debuting at the La Jolla Playhouse in 2004) to cover the recent 800 million budget shortfall currently hobbling the Garden State.""Goose it up too much and it gets cheesy"" Valli says to Gaudio in ""Jersey Boys"" about a song arrangement. Eastwood takes that line to heart. The unspoken B side of that warning however is worth heeding No particular style leads to a movie of no particular style.mjphillipstribune.com""Jersey Boys"" - 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for language throughout)Running time 212Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Reviews Jersey Boys logged stage time en route to big screen Video Jersey Boys trailer Latest movie reviews Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-jersey-boys-review-20140619,0,5891527.column",200,jerseyboys38,jerseyboys,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Clint Eastwood the big-time jazzbo who shoots every scene as though it were set inside of a coffin is an odd fit for a feature-length tribute to the age of matching-blazer music. Nonetheless he directs the hell out of Jersey Boys a jukebox musical about 60s hit makers Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons; there arent many directors out there who could fluidly pull off three different fourth-wall-breaking on-camera narrators or create the eerie chill of the moment where Valli (John Lloyd Young who originated the role on Broadway) sings the opening verse of ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You"" for the first time. The unfortunate trade-off of Eastwoods efficient real-deal classical direction is his stubborn commitment to the script. In this case that means eliding everything artistically interesting that the group ever did (like say The Genuine Imitation Life Gazette) and loading the back end of the movie with a mushy hit-by-hit structure that probably worked like gangbusters on stage but drags on screen. Eastwoods integrity puts the movie in a double bind; he wholly commits to an underdeveloped drama that was designed only to set up extended musical numbers and in the process makes the songs seem intrusive and padded. Once the back-to-back concert montages kick in the characters start shedding personality traits paradoxically becoming less and less well developed as the movie draws to a close. Sensitive small-town wunderkind Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) turns into a generic priss with a Van Dyke beard; rough-edged slickster Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) disappears altogether; and oafish bass player Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) becomes well a less interesting oafish bass player. Vallis independent-minded wife Mary (Renee Marino) turns into a pill-popping shrew. Valli himself remains a total cypher; at first the movies distance from him (hes the only band member who doesnt serve as a narrator) seems like a gutsy move. But by the final act it begins to resemble unadulterated idol worship. As Jersey Boys tells it the groups early years--narrated mostly by DeVito who addresses the viewer like a guest who has to be shown around the neighborhood--were defined as much by crime as by music. (Theres a considerable overlap with Goodfellas and hometown pal Joe Pesci--whose Goodfellas character was named after DeVito--turns up played by Joey Russo.) DeVito is introduced working as a gofer for Genovese boss Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken); between nightclub sets he pulls jobs with Massi. Valli serves as their lookout using his powerful falsetto to signal when the cops are coming. Rehearsals are used as cover for burglaries. When straight-laced Gaudio signs on he discovers that his bandmates make more money selling stolen clothes than playing shows.Theres a big gulf between the groups public image and its members personal lives and that gulf only gets bigger once its factored in that the lyrics to most of their hits--and all of the songs included in Jersey Boys--were penned by the more-or-less openly gay Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle). Theres a story to be told here about the value of artifice and music as a kind of fantasy life but Jersey Boys script (adapted by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice from their hit Broadway show) isnt interested in telling it. Even Eastwoods signature lean overcast style--which manages to invest the vague and inconsistent narrative with a sense of place and atmosphere--cant overcome Brickman and Elices fundamentally flawed structure which feels like the first half of a period drama cut together with the middle third of a tribute show.

Photo Keith Bernstein Warner Bros. Pictures Jersey Boys review Four Seasons music is high point 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Jersey Boys Musical drama. Starring John Lloyd Young Vincent Piazza and Erich Bergen. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (R. 134 minutes.) About midway through ""Jersey Boys"" a feeling settles in that this story might be bigger than it seems that this saga of a pop music group is also an important American story on a scale with previous big American stories directed by Clint Eastwood. The Four Seasons music starts to sound not like disparate hits but like a whole slice of Americana. And we react in the same way we might to the music of Glenn Miller or Artie Shaw with the sense that this is how people once were and what it was like. This sense of scale gradually fades. ""Jersey Boys"" contracts into what it probably always had to be just a likable and not overly romanticized portrait of the Four Seasons how they started and where they ended up. But the music maintains an exaggerated appeal throughout. Even if you have never particularly liked these songs you will like them here; and it wont just be a matter of Stockholm syndrome. Theres something about witnessing the birth of a sound - specifically ""Sherry"" their breakthrough - that makes that sound more beautiful. Based on the Tony Award-winning musical ""Jersey Boys"" begins in 1951 in Belleville N.J. an Italian American enclave. Tommy DeVito who eventually founds the group has a musical trio but hes also a petty criminal and the flunky for a benevolent mobster (Christopher Walken). Meanwhile Frankie Valli is still Frankie Castelluccio just a neighborhood kid albeit one with an extraordinary voice. Its really an open question if theyre going to make it in music or end up in jail. Related Stories Frameline film fest a snapshot of gay triumphs aspirations George Takei subject of documentary explores new galaxies Kenji Mizoguchi in Pacific Film Archive retrospective Eastwood captures the crazy local color - for example a clock flanked by a picture of the pope on one side and of Frank Sinatra on the other - without indulging in the routine condescension that usually attends Hollywoods portrayal of Italian Americans (see ""Moonstruck""). Though the trailer made it look like the movie might be a celebration of goon-hood the story of four slobs who made it big the films point of view is different. Success comes about through hard work persistence and the honoring of commitments. Valli (John Lloyd Young) is the central character flanked by two temperamental opposites who are essential to his success. DeVito (Vincent Piazza) an enigmatic frustrating figure puts Frankie in the group gets him into and out of trouble and raises money for the bands first demo - albeit by borrowing from a loan shark. Hes touchy incapable of admitting hes wrong and utterly selfish and irresponsible. But he makes things happen. Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) by contrast is the furthest thing from a thug. Hired as the bands keyboard player hes not from an ""old neighborhood"" type but a polite and studious guy from the suburbs with emotional discipline a head for business and lots of songwriting talent. The Four Seasons might have needed DeVito to get started but without Gaudio they would have been performing at bowling alleys for 30 years. The tension of ""Jersey Boys"" is of Valli finding himself in the middle of these personalities and having to define his loyalties. Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice adapting the screenplay from their own libretto locate the moments of joy in the music itself in finding the harmonies for ""Sherry"" or recording ""Walk Like a Man."" Aside from that and one wild party success looks like a bleak affair especially as directed by Eastwood who turns down the light and mutes the celebration. Its the right strategy for a story whose entire success depends on its honesty and whose honesty depends on not turning these guys into heroes. We come away with a feeling for pop stardom as seen from the inside the traveling and performing the dealing with the same people all day and the worrying about the business end. There are some jarring notes some modern expressions you would not have heard decades ago and some anachronisms. In 1951 someone makes a joke about Topo Gigios appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" a full decade before that puppets debut. The screenplay is oddly structured going up to 1970 and then backtracking to fill in missing information. The movie maintains interest but loses momentum. In one scene Valli sings ""My Eyes Adored You"" to his daughter 10 years before it was written. Then weirdly this becomes the theme associated with the daughter even though the song is about a boyhood crush hardly appropriate sentiments for a man to be directing at his own child. I also wonder why as the young Joe Pesci appears as a character in the film they didnt find a guy who sounds and acts something like Joe Pesci. It might have been fun. More seriously the story - as true stories often will - gets diffused as time goes on and the effort to make a climax of Vallis performing ""Cant Take My Eyes Off of You"" barely lands. Still by then youre in that world sucked in by the music and the performances. Appreciate the big things but while watching also pay attention to the little grace notes that make up a quality production. John Lloyd Young who is 38 plays Valli from age 17 through 56 and he never looks like hes wearing a mask or costume. The same could be said for Vincent Piazza as DeVito (ages 23 through 62) and the rest. The hair and makeup are seamless. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Photo AP/Warner Bros. MOVIE REVIEW Jersey Boys Running time 134 minutes. Rated R (profanity). At the E-Walk the Lincoln Square others. Clint Eastwood makes our day as the seemingly miscast director of ""Jersey Boys adding dramatic heft to this hit-filled perfectly cast big-screen adaptation of the long-running Broadway musical. You couldnt ask for a more meticulous depiction of the 50s when the musical group that would become the Four Seasons was first organized by Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) a gofer for genial New Jersey crime boss Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken). Gyp is particularly enamored of the falsetto of 16-year-old Francesco Castelluccio (Tony winner John Lloyd Young) whos also been dabbling with hilarious ineptitude in small-time crime. John Lloyd Young portrays Frankie Valli in the screen adaptation of the beloved musical.Photo AP/Warner Bros. So renamed Frankie Valli the teenager joins Tommy and fellow Rahway State Prison alumnus Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) to pursue their show-business dreams before mostly unappreciative audiences. The group struggles to find success or even an identity until a young Joe Pesci (yes that Joe Pesci) suggests the guys recruit the clean-cut Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) a songwriting whiz who can quote T.S. Eliot. Then they hookup with flamboyantly gay producer-lyricist Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) at Manhattans legendary Brill Building -- and after a trying apprenticeship as backup singers take the name Four Seasons from a bowling alley. The hits dont start arriving until 1960 nearly 45 minutes into Marshall Brickman and Rick Elices smart adaptation of their Broadway book. Eastwood doesnt do anything especially fancy with the staging of the numbers which works just fine. Its hard to go wrong with such gems as ""Sherry ""Big Girls Dont Cry and ""Walk Like a Man performed live before the cameras by Young who sounds uncannily like Valli and the rest of the group. Piazza serves as the films dramatic engine his Tommy increasingly jealous and resentful of the growing collaboration between Frankie and the show-business savvy Bob. As the groups manager he also racks up enough serious loan-shark debt to put the foursomes future in jeopardy. While the film is often lots of fun its quite knowing about how scandals were kept under wraps in the 60s -- and the terrible toll that constant touring took on Frankie and his family (Renee Marino Erica Piccininni and Freya Tingley play the somewhat underwritten women in Frankies life). The film retains the shows device of telling the story from each of the four protagonists points of view a breaking of the fourth wall that doesnt always work on the big screen. But it does here. Eastwoods handpicked cast delivers the goods down to the smallest roles. Donnie Kehr manages to be both funny and menacing as a mob rep sent to collect from Tommy before the Seasons debut on ""The Ed Sullivan Show. And Lomendas Nick who seems like the fourth wheel stops the show with a climactic speech. ""Jersey Boys"" hits theaters Friday.Photo AP/Warner Bros. The director even pulls off a tricky coda set at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25 years after the original groups breakup. ""Jersey Boys tells a familiar story yes -- but rarely told this well and with this much heart and soul.

And it isnt as if he was trying to make ""Goodfellas"" set to music.RELATED Top 10 Clint Eastwood moviesBut it would have been nice if he had delved into a little more of the unsavory aspects of the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons instead of just hinting at them. (See ""Bird"" Eastwoods film about troubled jazz great Charlie Parker.) This is not a major complaint -- ""Jersey Boys"" is a good movie and the performances are first-rate.But Eastwood should have roughed things up a little more like some of the colorful characters in the New Jersey neighborhood where Valli grew up might have. Instead he settles for telling the tale in the most straightforward of fashions. Interesting but not as interesting as it might have been.INTERVIEW John Lloyd Young in Jersey BoysThe film like the stage production involves each of the four band members turning toward the camera and talking telling us their perspective on the rise and fall of one of the most popular bands of the early 1960s.Stick with Tommys. Its the most interesting.Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) tells us flat out if you want to know the real story youve got to talk to him. Of course he does. He grows up as a hood running errands for local mobster Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken). He takes Frankie (John Lloyd Young who won a Tony for the Broadway show) under his wing which is not entirely a good thing.INTERVIEW Clint Eastwood reflects on age America and actingTommy has a band and he recognizes Frankies talents as a singer. But Tommy is also headed for trouble in a hurry and ropes Frankie in on some of his schemes.Ah but that voice. Thats what saves Frankie. At least we presume so; Eastwood working from the script by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice (who wrote the musical book) doesnt spell it out clearly. Frankie just kind of turns good.RELATED Clint Eastwood takes Jersey Boys from stage to screenHe also turns around the fortunes of Tommys band. So does Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) who would become the Four Seasons principal songwriter. Tommy is jealous of their bond and he should be Its clear that musically and otherwise theyre leaving him behind.Its pretty standard stuff from there. They struggle to get signed they cant find the right material things dont go their way ... and then they do. Theyre helped by producer and lyricist Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) who has the contacts they crave and the New York apartment they can only dream of. (Doyle is outstanding playing the openly gay Crewe as smarter than Bob and tougher than Tommy with a confidence that doesnt allow either man to question it even in those closeted times.)RELATED An unlikely harmony for Eastwood in Jersey BoysThe road begins to take its toll but so do Tommys transgressions. He cant leave the hoodlum life behind it seems and it will cost him and the band plenty. The film takes off when Tommy is front and center becoming something more than a standard biopic with cool tunes. (The hits like ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" and ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You"" are well-represented and well-done.)Thats in part because Tommy has the most conflict in his life but also because Piazza is so good. Theres always some scheme brewing behind his eyes and disaster not far behind it. Piazzas performance is the most complex in the film (with the possible exception of Doyles). Its also the grittiest.""Jersey Boys"" for all its charms could have used more of that.Review Jersey Boys 3.5 starsDirector Clint Eastwood.Cast John Lloyd Young Vincent Piazza Christopher Walken.Rating R for language throughout.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Pictures musical ""Jersey Boys"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release. (AP Photo/Courtesy Warner Bros. Keith Bernstein) Share PhotoYou dont have to be middle-aged or even an adult to know songs like ""Sherry"" Big Girls Dont Cry"" and ""Walk Like a Man."" Sure theyre 60s-era hits by The Four Seasons but theyve become such pop culture fixtures that even youngsters whove never heard the name Frankie Valli could surely croon a few bars in his signature falsetto.Its little wonder that the stage musical ""Jersey Boys"" has become one of the most successful shows in Broadway history on the strength of those sublimely catchy tunes. And its also little wonder that the prospect of bringing the show to the screen appealed to Clint Eastwood who at 84 is still blessedly up for challenges.Whats rather curious though is that with all the talent involved -- not only Eastwood as director but an excellent cast plucked from ""Jersey Boys"" stage regulars -- the film is distinctly uneven hugely appealing at times and oddly pedestrian even cheesy at others.One problem may be that ""Jersey Boys"" tries to do a few things at once. On one level its a fairly faithful re-creation of the Broadway show; the same writers Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice penned the screenplay and the excellent John Lloyd Young reprises his Tony-winning performance as Valli. But it also aims to be an edgier film exploring the bands entanglements with the mob back in Jersey -- a sort of ""Goodfellas"" to pop music. The goals dont always mix.The dialogue too sometimes sounds overly well stagey. And a key convention of the show -- band members breaking the fourth wall to address the audience directly -- is used unevenly abandoned for long stretches and suddenly popping up when it doesnt feel needed.We begin as Frankie Castelluccio a sweet-faced boy of 16 (Young at 38 somehow pulls this off) is trying to break through as a singer while training at a barbershop. Luckily hes supported by music-loving mob boss Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken in a sure-bet role here) and loyal buddy Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) who cant stay out of trouble himself but through sheer grit launches the band that will become The Four Seasons.The two plus bassist Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) are struggling for attention when aspiring agent Joey Pesci (yes that Joe Pesci) introduces them to songwriter Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen.) Gaudios talent is just what they need.It takes a full hour to get to a big musical number and boy its a welcome relief to hear the boys sing ""Sherry"" their first number-one hit.Other hits follow -- and all kinds of trouble. The movie best when it lets us simply enjoy these lovely harmonies and Youngs terrific falsetto stylings soon veers back into band infighting. Tommy we learn has landed the boys in serious financial straits. Heartache ensues.And what about the women you ask? Alas they begin on the sidelines and stay there. As Mary Frankies wife Renee Marino is sexy and smart in the beginning but turns into a total caricature of a drunken shrew by mid-movie. Speaking of caricatures Frankies yelling-across-the-table Italian-American family seems a bit much too.On a technical level the film veers between creative and oddly mediocre namely in a driving sequence that looks so fake you wonder if it was intentional.Theres one striking misstep in tone too. When Frankie sings ""My Eyes Adored You"" to his school-aged daughter you have to wonder if the filmmakers thought about this prominent lyric certainly not meant to be about a child ""Though I never laid a hand on you my eyes adored you.""The film though comes through at other moments mainly those involving the pure joy of making music that sounds good. A closing credits sequence is like a Broadway show of its own (and who doesnt love to see Walken dancing?) At those moments much is forgiven. Sure.

What sounds to you or I or any rational individual like a peregrine falcon creaking out its death-kaw became when produced and arranged by Brill Building geniuses like Bob Gaudio and Bob Crewe a string of number one hits. Hey weirder things have happened. The story of Vallis ascent - and were using the term story very loosely here - was eventually turned into a sanctioned jukebox musical that has brought appeasement to dazed New York tourists for years. You come to town you look at the tall buildings you gotta go see some kind of show you go see ""Jersey Boys."" While the Broadway production may very well have plenty of pop and polish (Ive never gone; I leave my visiting cousins at the door) Clint Eastwoods soporific film version is a defiantly dull retelling of the bands history. Do you really want to know what went on behind the closed doors of . . .their accountants office?? Well look no further cause ""Jersey Boys"" is going to bust it wide open for you. ""Jersey Boys"" as adapted from the play by its book authors Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice doubles down on its Italian-American rags-to-riches angle. Its hardly original (three minutes in and theres a ""that guy"" from ""The Sopranos"") but when Mama is yellin about her baby not wanting to mangia his meatballs well its hard not to crack a familiar smile. Young Frankie (John Lloyd Young) is a good kid and a tender singer its just that hes mixed up with that no good hoodlum Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza.) DeVito of course isnt just a two-bit hustler of stolen liquor with connections to the mob (Christopher Walken in his most ""doing a Christopher Walken role"" ever) hes the visionary of what will become Vallis group The Four Seasons. With Tommy on guitar (and as manager) plus comic relief Nick (Michael Lomenda) on bass and as secret weapon the not-very-ethnic Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) as principal songwriter and pianist the group soon finds their groove with flamboyant producer Bob Crewe. I cannot tell a lie watching the neighborhood kids shelve their street tough ways for magic in the studio makes for some intriguing scenes. Its always great to see the creative process on screen even if its glamorized beyond all believability. The shock comes when this slow movie reaches what feels like a good point to end - and you realize you are only about 45 minutes in. Good God this is a slog. The second half is all about the groups money woes. Seriously like I dont have my own problems. Oh theres a scene early on where Frankie meets a woman (a very funny Renee Marino as brassy as they come) so theres an attempt to shoehorn in a lovestory. They quickly marry but she disappears only to come back when the story needs a cliche castrating bitch. Right before the movie ends were supposed to care about one of their kids who is having problems. Were told that shes an angel. Sure well take your word for it. Some female character in this movie has to be good - every other one is merely a swooning trophy that gets about half-a-line before being shooed away by men who have some serious talking to do. Eastwood who once upon a time was a flavorful director is working in movie-of-the-week mode here. Cheesy direct bland. Anyone expecting big musical numbers will be disappointed. With the exception of a closing credits bit all the singing is done static on a stage or in the studio. Christopher Walken is having a good time in his expanded cameo - he wears a silk robe and speaks Italian - but theres nothing too deep for him to tap into here. There are many biopics about musicians that use the Wikipedia beats to extract some sort of universal meaning. ""Walk the Line"" does this. ""Control"" does this. Hell ""Amadeus"" does this better than any of them. ""Jersey Boys"" is instead strangely focused on hewing strictly to reportage on the ins and outs of Franki Vallis not-very-interesting life.

If you think summer movies are clamorous try a current Broadway musical. Watching Jersey Boys onstage is like soldiering through some extreme eating contest where youre force-fed dessert for three hours. Its all falsetto heroics and hustled-through character drama every beat of every scene over-scored over-rehearsed and overbearing. And its often glorious even as the sugar-rush of ""Sherry"" chills and hardens into a brain freeze. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - At the end when the original Four Seasons reunite at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Frankie Valli launches into a tender mid-song monologue to tell us what moment of his storied career meant the most to him over the years. The best? ""Four guys under a street lamp when it was all still ahead of us the first time we made that sound -- our sound."" The tweet-size speech written by Rick Elice and Marshall Brickman is terrifically moving. But heres the thing The Broadway show never even slowed down long enough to show us that street lamp moment or the discovery of that sound. As the Valli character reminisced I thought ""Man Id love to see a musical about that.""Clint Eastwoods likable film of Jersey Boys doesnt have time for that moment either. Still Eastwoods metabolism saps along at about half the rate of a Broadway directors and hes not about to play jaunty reprises between each scene. That saves the movie. Rather than an assault its a parade of expertly staged (if often familiar) moments that on occasion do something the stage version never attempts feel a little bit like life as humans live it or at least like life as it is in old movies. Then at healthy intervals John Lloyd Young (the Tony-winner who originated the Valli role on Broadway) uncorks that falsetto and the gush of pleasure washes away the films minor infelicities.Film DetailsCritics Pick Jersey Boys RatingR GenreMusical Running Time134 More Info Trailer Eastwood knows a trick Broadway forgot once ticket prices hit triple digits Leave em wanting more. He also has a feel for street toughs and their prickly pride anchoring early scenes of street crime and bar life with welcome weight. Their misadventures feel scrappy and desperate and the rifts that spread within the band as they start racking up No. 1s -- mostly fights over girls and money -- come to feel momentous. Two of the Four Seasons were dedicated pop-music craftsmen; two were regular guys from the neighborhood chafing at being outclassed.Eastwoods best sequence is a lengthy meeting between the boys a Jersey mob boss played by Christopher Walken and the loan shark whom band founder Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) owes 162000. Its a one-act rich with preening alphas wounded egos terrible revelations several big reversals a hilarious explosion from the quietest Season (Michael Lomenda) and a rousing declaration from Youngs Valli who manages to take over the band and honor his debts to DeVito and the old neighborhood all at the same time. At the height of the groups fame Valli winds up on his own touring relentlessly to pay back an impossible sum he feels he owes to the folks who gave him a shot. It plays like a gangland parody of todays student loan racket.Eastwood doesnt have the running time to treat all the significant events so thoroughly. The misery of Vallis road-warrior life is only briefly dramatized. The family drama including a late tragedy is skimmed over as are the details of the singers lifelong partnership with songwriter Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) the boy wonder behind ""Short Shorts"" and the last to join the original Four Seasons. Gaudio was also the only member of the group with no criminal past the only one with any business savvy and the only one not from a strictly working-class background all of which Bergen suggests in his every scene and all of which sets off DeVito.The film retains the shows multi-narrator structure which casts a different Jersey Boy as our guide for each act sometimes explaining their motivations right into the camera. But Eastwood doesnt fully commit to the conceit allowing long stretches to pass without narration. This sows some confusion When one of the boys starts talking to someone offscreen you might think hes delivering a monologue. Also distracting the occasional too-cute moment straight from the stage show as when Valli and Gaudio knock on doors in a Brill Building hallway apparently modeled on the set of Laugh-In -- behind each lurks a keyed-up comic actor ready to pounce.But the performances are tough-minded and idiosyncratic especially Piazzas DeVito a bullying prick who for all his nasty quirks -- blowing his nose on hotel towels for one -- touches some universal pathos the sadness of the cocksure also-ran the local hero not built to cut it on the world stage. Youngs Valli grows from horny schlemiel to confident master and his singing is glorious especially as his material richens as the 60s grind over him.In the end that sound is what soars most. If you have any love for it Jersey Boys should steamroll right over you especially the climactic revelation of ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You"" a grown-up hit that eschews the old sugar rush in favor of sublimity. Eastwood may never show us his boys discovering themselves under that street lamp but he gives us a clutch of moments worth treasuring -- and mostly without overdoing it.

TWITTER Clint Eastwood adapts the stage story of working-class street guys who made it big but never could entirely surmount their personal limitations. A dash of showbiz pizzazz has been lost but some welcome emotional depth has been gained in the big-screen version of the still-thriving theatrical smash Jersey Boys. Approaching its 10th year on Broadway the highly entertaining account of the checkered career of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons is currently the 13th longest-running show in Broadway history and continues to flourish on tour. The films basic fidelity to its source along with the musics continuing appeal suggests solid prospects among mainstream audiences for this story of working-class street guys who made it big but never could entirely surmount their personal limitations. Still commercial uncertainties attach to the potential interest of young viewers unfamiliar with the band and musical milieu of a half-century ago as well as in foreign-language markets. Creatively the big question here is how the seemingly odd matchup of Jersey Boys and director Clint Eastwood worked out. As has been widely noted theres perhaps no one less Joisey than West Coast jazz aficionado Eastwood and suspicion has also surrounded the great old pros feel for Broadway musical tropes as well as his tendency toward deliberate pacing. STORY Stage Stars Talk Big-Screen Differences In Clint Eastwoods Jersey Boys But while his work may lack the snap and precision of a Bob Fosse not to mention the dynamic cutting of directors of the music video generation it must be recalled that Eastwood has always displayed an enduring affinity for American popular music an interest expressed in his music scene-oriented features (Honkytonk Man and Bird not to mention his still-unrealized remake of A Star Is Born) the many music-based documentaries he has produced and the scores he has written for seven of his films. Less tangible but more crucial is the directors feel for the struggle the long road that must often be traversed to achieve show business success the price that must often be paid. Far more than in the stage show which acknowledges the hardships but always cuts quickly back to fun stuff there is stress on how being on the road away from mates and kids inevitably takes a heavy toll and on the considerable cost of a determined commitment to success in the arts. While this is hardly banner news its highlighting enriches the material emotionally and dramatically providing a bracing dose of melancholy before the final musical surge. Like The Four Seasons Eastwood persevered through ups and downs during the 1950s and into the early 1960s; that hes simpatico with their personal and professional travails is evident and adds heft to the film. Jersey Boys may be a jukebox musical but its a jukebox musical with a good book as well as a raft of songs that remain as infectious as they were five decades back. For the film the shows original book writers Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice have retained their Rashomon-style structure of offering different points of view on events by shifting the narrative voice from one bandmember to another. Eastwood has smoothly incorporated the direct-address technique to the film something mainstream audiences might now accept more easily than before in the wake of House of Cards. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies Something else the film gets away with is having a 38-year-old actor play Frankie Valli as a 16-year-old. John Lloyd Young originated the role on Broadway in 2005 and while other actor-singers have convincingly re-created Vallis dynamic falsetto vocal tones onstage Young demonstrated an indelible knack for evoking the originals sound in his Tony Award-winning performance that no one else cold top. As little Francesco Castelluccio the future star grows up in working-class Belleville with the pope and Frank Sinatra staring down from mantelpiece photos and pals that seem far more likely to wind up as made men than as showbiz luminaries even if one of the more eager of them was the real-life Joe Pesci a crucial supporting character here. For a while its sort of ""American Graffiti Meets Mean Streets"" with Frankie and some sidewalk pals notably good-looking small-time con Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) pulling pranks and an amusingly stupid botched robbery in a neighborhood reigned over by benevolent godfather-type Angelo ""Gyp"" DeCarlo (a smooth Christopher Walken); amusingly the name of Pescis character in GoodFellas is Tommy DeVitto. Its 1951 the American pop scene is at its most syrupy and the musical horizons of Frankie Tommy and their momentary cohorts are limited to tacky lounges and clubs. Where Joe Pesci figures is in introducing the boys to Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) a straight-arrow comparatively clean-cut kid who at 15 has already written one national hit (the immortal ""Short Shorts"") for his group the Royal Teens. Proud hotheaded Tommy resists but Bobs amazingly facile songwriting skills combined with the recording savvy of producer and sometime music co-writer Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) put the newly christened The Four Seasons (formerly The Four Lovers) in the groove for massive success. Like the show the film bounces through the pre-fame exposition in agreeable surfacy way typical of Broadway musicals establishing the essentials of Frankies talent and earnestness Tommys short-tempered enthusiasm and recklessness and a feeling that somethings coming and its gonna be good. And sure enough at the halfway point once bassist Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) completes the band and Crewe takes the reins the floodgates open and the hits just keep on coming ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" and ""Walk Like a Man"" were all No. 1 hits in 1962-63 and the roll continued with ""Rag Doll"" ""Bye Bye Baby"" ""Lets Hang On"" and ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You"" among others. But the silver lining of success hides dark and turbulent clouds beneath; unbeknownst to the others Tommy who doubles as the bands manager sinks deeply into debt to the mob requiring the eventual involvement of Gyp and Herculean labors by Frankie to extricate them while the latters near-constant absence from home fosters great guilt over tragic family events. PHOTOS Ray Davies Donovan Honored at Songwriters Hall of Fame Still as per the norm for musicals theres nearly always an uptick after disappointment and thats easily found in The Four Seasons catalog. The continuing durability of these songs and Vallis uniquely expressive high voice are the biggest reasons for the stage shows great success. Very few other American pop groups with roots in the pre-British Invasion period remain as listenable today as The Four Seasons and this combined with the GoodFellas-lite backdrop give Jersey Boys both onstage and onscreen all the juice it needs. But if the ultimate aim of the theatrical version which began life at San Diegos La Jolla Playhouse in 2004 and was fine-tuned and re-cast before hitting Broadway was to get the audience on its feet for the final feel-good medley Eastwood goes for a more mixed mood combining the joy of the music with what Valli in particular lost and could never regain. Rather than lip-synching to pre-recorded tracks the performers all sang during filming to live behind-the-scenes musical accompaniment in the interest of maximum spontaneity and credibility. Both musically and dramatically all four actors playing bandmembers register distinctively; Young has Frankie down cold Piazza (also in his late 30s) sharply expresses Tommys streetwise edge and impulsiveness but with enough likability to suggest why everyone always forgave the guy while Bergen a veteran of the shows Las Vegas production is very appealing as the nice-guy outsider who provided the essential missing ingredient to the band. Lomendas Massi the last to join the group and the first to leave hangs in the background much of the time but finally emerges interestingly when he takes over as a narrator. STORY Jersey Boys to Close Out Los Angeles Film Festival Doyles brashly confident Bob Crewe supplies not only energy but interesting gay currents to an otherwise macho Italian-American scene. Bathed in muted hues dominated by tans and browns the film has a warm fulsome look courtesy of Tom Sterns cinematography James J. Murakamis production design and Deborah Hoppers costumes; one dazzling effects shot rises from ground level up the facade of Manhattans legendary Brill Building to peer in the windows of multiple floors worth of music publishers and agents. Very occasionally however the feeling of the studio backlot is inescapable and there are a couple of Jersey neighborhood vistas that simply look too California including one with mountains visible in the far background.

Though based on a smash-hit jukebox tuner that won four Tonys Clint Eastwoods adaptation of ""Jersey Boys"" cant properly be described as a full-on musical. It does often hint at becoming one just as it hints at becoming a ""La Bamba""-esque early rock study a cautionary tale about organized crime and a sort of ""Rashomon""-influenced take on the rise of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. But by the time it hits its first real Broadway-style production number over the closing credits ""Jersey Boys"" doesnt seem to have gotten any closer to deciding what kind of movie it wants to be. Embracing neither the fizzy energy of a Vegas-ready tuner nor the grit of a warts-and-all biopic the film nonetheless has its own peculiar charms and should be able to capitalize on the source materials enduring popularity for a respectable if modest B.O. haul. Though Eastwood didnt have the best of luck with musicals as an actor this property ought to have been well within his directorial wheelhouse. As a helmer hes always had an astute ear for music; he excels at regionally specific ambiance and period studies and here he avoids the musicvideo shooting style that has turned so many recent film tuners into brightly colored slurry. But as handsome as his compositions are Eastwoods filmmaking simply doesnt have the snap or the feel for rhythm that the scripts rapid-fire theatrical patter requires and the relative dearth of prominent musical performances turns what could have been a dancing-in-the-aisles romp into a bit of a slog. Eastwoods somber dramatic focus is on display from the start as he opens not with a song but rather a thoroughly Scorsesean scene inside a Belleville N.J. barbershop in the 1950s Golden-throated 16-year-old Frankie Castelluccio (John Lloyd Young) is a barber in training attending to local mob boss Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken). Its the kind of neighborhood where as petty criminal and guitarist Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) tells the camera in direct address the only ways to escape are joining the army getting ""mobbed up"" or getting famous. ""For us"" he says ""it was two out of three."" DeVito enlists Castelluccio as a lookout for a heist that goes sour and lands Tommy in prison but from these inauspicious beginnings the seeds of the Four Seasons are sown. With Castelluccio renaming himself Frankie Valli and DeVitos fellow profiteer Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) joining on bass the group is introduced to precocious songwriter Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) by wannabe talent scout Joey Pesci (Joseph Russo) -- later known simply as Joe Pesci -- and finally finds its sound. Though the first 45 minutes are littered with sporadic song fragments its only here that the film starts to truly resemble a musical with Gaudio gathering his new bandmates around the piano to play ""Cry for Me"" as each man joins in turn. Its the sort of scene that was orchestrated far more organically in ""Once"" but its nonetheless effective at conveying the joy of sudden harmonic epiphany. After they catch the ear of flamboyant producer-lyricist Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle adding some welcome shadings to what could have been a one-joke gay stereotype) the Four Seasons shoot to the top of the charts. The music finally comes alive in the middle section that follows. Staging three consecutive numbers as live television performances Eastwood shifts among wide angles from way up in the cheap seats glimpses from behind the TV monitors and slightly obstructed views from inside the audience pit in front of the stage. This style might sap the sequences of some of the explosive engagement that a flashier director like Rob Marshall might have brought to the numbers but it manages to honor the period and the materials stage origins in a nicely unshowy way. After this high however comes a rather long hangover. Interpersonal squabbles money woes groupies domestic drama and lingering mob connections all cause predictable problems in predictable ways and the films focus starts to blur going for long stretches without any music at all. Even though each of the groups four members take turns narrating their side of the story -- breaking the fourth wall in a broadly theatrical manner for which Eastwood never finds a proper cinematic correlative -- none of them really deepen into fully dimensional men. Initially providing doses of Puckish mischief DeVitos insouciance gradually curdles into irritation and he disappears for much of the last third. Valli remains unknowable a good-hearted blue-collar entertainer without much of an apparent life. Gaudio who bears an uncanny resemblance to ""Election""-era Chris Klein goes from teetotaling T.S. Eliot-quoting square to bearded artiste with little in between. And poor Massi is the bass player. Aside from ""Boardwalk Empire"" support player Piazza three of the four leads were drawn from various stage iterations of ""Jersey Boys"" and while all are solid in their respective roles (Tony winner Young does a stunning job channeling Vallis sublime falsetto) they only occasionally seem to be surfing the same wave. Christopher Walken creates most of the films laughs by simple virtue of being Christopher Walken but his doddering don screams out for a bigger broader performance. The marvelously venomous Renee Marino gets a fantastic introductory scene as Vallis first wife Mary and is then subsequently squandered as a one-note boozy nag. Production designer James J. Murakami expends a good deal of energy on vintage period details but its disappointing how little the story itself explores such an exciting era for music. Four Seasons contemporaries like the Beatles and the Beach Boys are never mentioned; nor is there any discussion of the groups distinctive style or the way a quartet with two ex-con members managed to sell themselves as such a squeaky-clean outfit. We see the boys receive a cake in honor of their three consecutive No. 1 singles but we never get an idea what pop stardom in the early 1960s must have felt like. And the only real nod to the vicissitudes of recording comes via an unintentionally hilarious scene where Crewe after hearing four seconds of ""Sherry"" over the phone immediately declares his intention to double-track Vallis voice on the record helpfully hollering ""its never been done before"" On a technical level the film is strangely hit-and-miss. Tom Sterns shadowy photography can be gorgeously low-key in one scene then garishly lit and sheened with yellow in the next. Eastwood and editors Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach pull off some graceful slow pans and Sorkinesque walk-and-talks only for some hideous rear projection to mar a few driving scenes. Costume designer Deborah Hopper does great work but while the old-age makeup on display in the closing scenes is a noticeable improvement on ""J. Edgar"" it still might elicit a chuckle or two.

Dkampitsis says November 15 2014 at 814 pm After all the advertising hype we rented the dvd.....WHAT A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT...should have known that such an early release usually indicates that a film TANKS like Jersey Boys did. It is so disjointed that often had to rewindreplay in order to try to follow the story line which was all over the place. PERHAPS whom ever did the editing should be blamed or Clint Eastwood on producing this disaster. Reply Judy Colclough says July 14 2014 at 1100 am THIS WAS WONDERFUL. I SAW IT ON STAGE 7 TIMES AND THE MOVIE SO FAR 3 TIMES. CLINT EASTWOOD DID A WONDERFUL JOB AND ALL THE PLAYERS WERE GREAT. I WILL CERTAINLY BUY IT WHEN IT COMES OUT. Reply Karen Hopkins says July 5 2014 at 123 pm This was a GREAT AWESOME and ENJOYABLE Movie from beginning to end...These people doing the reviews of Jersey Boys probably didnt even go see the movie Cant wait to buy this on DVD so Ill always have it... Thanks Clint Frankie and all involved in making a Great and Entertaining Movie Reply GKN says July 13 2014 at 417 pm I agree. The review is terrible but the movie was great. Best film Ive seen all year - and that includes several Oscar noms I belatedly caught up on. Dodgy old-age make-up in one brief scene is the only pan I agree with in this critique. The reviewer should get more sleep or something. Unless I see something better by December I hope this film cleans up at award time Reply DENNIS says July 4 2014 at 716 pm Excellent movie Reply Patrick Mulqueeney says June 30 2014 at 813 am Have seen the live musical three times. The movie was very good and well represents the Jersey Boys story. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to view an American success story. PMM Reply Sandra says June 28 2014 at 1016 pm Went to see it with my bf and a friend. Loved it It was funny sad music was so good I wanna see it again Reply Carol Schmitt says June 26 2014 at 303 pm I seen the movie for the 2nd time today (and Ive never done that) and I love it. Very entertaining. Ill be going for a 3rd time over the weekend. Dont listen to the critics. Go for yourself. Reply CDR says June 25 2014 at 825 pm I disagree with all the bad reviews of ""Jersey Boys"". I saw the play on Broadway 3 times all with John LLoyd Young as Frankie who to me was the best choice to play in the movie version. I think the movie was true to the play and the way Eastwood put it together was fantastic. it was also very authentic to the time as well. His choices for all the actors were fantastic. I loved Piazza as Devito. The end dance scene had me dancing in my seat. I loved ever minute of it. Cant wait for the DVD so I can watch it over and over. Reply Latest Posts from the Business Information Centre says June 23 2014 at 326 am The reviews of the Jersey Boys have upset me so I wrote a blog post review to counter them http//impressionablesarah.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/jersey-boys-silence-is-not-golden-in.html Reply Margery Cherin says June 21 2014 at 334 pm As someone who has seen JB on stage 14 times I believe I can be a serious critic for Mr. Eastwoods movie. Let me start by saying I absolutely loved it and have been so looking forward to its release yesterday. I saw it twice. That being said here are my opinions. He made a major mistake by eliminating Falin Angel from the movie. Its the one place in the show that brings tears. Especially since Francine was brought into the movie larger than the stage play. The play has simple but incredible choreography yet it wasnt shown enough in the movie. Panning the camera back wouldnt have taken a lot of effort however it would have had the audience dancing in their seat. One scene with the boys singing and some moves was SO off timing. How could that have slipped by anyone editing. I was embarrassed for Mr. Eastwood. 2 very small last things. It didnt bother me the first time I watched the movie yesterday but it did the second cutting the sit down with Francine by 1-2 minutes along with the girlfriend packing her suitcase by another 1-2 minutes would have sped things up. It got a little draggy in both scenes. Again these are just my opinions and yes I will go back to see it again. For the most part I give it a B. Reply Trish says June 21 2014 at 334 pm Everyone has a right to their own opinion and I love the fact 3 of the 4 main roles went to actors who performed the roles in the musical. I saw the musical 4 times the first seeing John Lloyd Young perform it on Broadway twice in Chicago amp; once in Detroit. I loved it every time. When rumors started that Clint Eastwood was making it into a movie I was ecstatic.Was it perfect? Probably not nothing is but it followed the musical very closely.amp; gave a bit more background amp; relationship insight than stage constraints allowed. I loved the attention to detail of the 50s amp; 60s costumes amp; scenery amp; vehicles. You felt you were in that time.again which was very cool.. Although I always liked the 4 Seasons I never really appreciated them until I saw Jersey Boys amp; heard their story and listened to their music again. Clint Eastwood has given us a chance to do it all over again in his movie and I thank him for that. Ive already seen the movie twice and probably will see it a couple more times before it leaves the theaters. I get the same uplifting feeling from the movie that I got from the play and that is a good thing Reply Diann says June 21 2014 at 244 pm Best film I have seen in months. Crowds were rockin and rollin in their seats. Run to see Jersey Boys. Reply wayne godfrey says June 20 2014 at 130 pm I just got back from watching.I give the movie 5 Gold stars. Just loved it. Full of feeling. I felt like I knew Frankie ...Valli. I bet if they had not made it in singing they would be part of the Goodfellas. Reply Julienne says June 19 2014 at 511 pm Cant wait It looks great...and I like Clint Eastwoods Directing. Reply Tom Borchardt says June 17 2014 at 1232 pm I find some of these complaints about the film to be amazing.. Reviewers are all in a tizzy that jersey boys cant be fit into one film category or the other..as if a movie has to be one kind of film or the other to be any good...jersey boys is a drama with music...if it were a drama about guys that worked in advertising.. you would see the personal lives with a few scenes in the office..this film is a drama with people who happen to be singers.. The fact that it was not a full blown musical with one big production number after the other is what every critic loved about the play.. The movie maintains the focus of the play with the music the backdrop to the story..maybe the reviewers never saw the play..or just did not get it..the Broadway play was pretty drab with its sparce set design but it was a hit with the public and critics alike..now the reviewer seems upset at the lack of song and dance numbers that were never there to begin with...just so it can be called a musical Reply Grace says June 16 2014 at 527 pm Clearly you have never seen the musical production of Jersey Boys before. While the show is very joyful and entertaining parts of the story are not supposed to be that way It would be a disgrace to the Four Seasons and their fans as well as fans of the show to change the story to suit those like you. A major point of the musical is the influence their personal lives and decisions had on their music. Props to Eastwood for putting his touch on the story while still keeping it original and not conforming it to fit your wants Reply Mary Ann Arlotta says June 16 2014 at 346 am Whether you see this movie is up to you but the story based on what Ive read. is not just music frolic its the story of what it took for the 4 Seasons to ""make it in the record business"". Its the ""behind the scenes"" and the music that got them there. His falsetto voice was something nobody had ever heard before it probably took some selling. I was just a kid then but hearing ""Sherry"" for the first time was interesting. Reply Tim says June 15 2014 at 506 pm As I highly suspected from the over-wrought trailer Eastwood has sucked every bit of the joy out of what was a highly entertaining Broadway musical. Not one Broadway production number until the end credits? Count me out. On video maybe but Im not paying 13 for an overlong segment of Behind the Music. Reply Mary Ann Arlotta says June 15 2014 at 218 pm To begin with I havent seen Jersey Boys yet but the movie cant just be a biopic and just cant be a musical. The story is about how the 4 Seasons started and how their music got them to where they are. Mr. Eastwood probably took both ideas into consideration. Reply LOL says June 15 2014 at 1230 pm An R-rated Hollywood movie thats not a comedy is like gold dust. Strange how only dudes in their seventies and eighties choose to direct them. The young filmmakers have no edge the geriatrics do. Reply Julienne says June 19 2014 at 512 pm Your comment is extremely ignorant and immature. Whatre you...seven? Reply Queens Boy says June 15 2014 at 920 am For those that saw and enjoyed the show and are predisposed to like the movie this review feels like a colonoscopy. Eastwoods take expanded the musical to enhance the story but maintained the musical dynamism. Clearly to much over thinking . Reply ThomT says June 15 2014 at 838 am I always try to view stage musicals transferred to screen the same way. Know the score know the story but try to forget what I saw on stage. For me that worked well with ""Dreamgirls"" perfectly with ""Chicago"" disappointingly with""Annie"" and disgustingly with ""A Chorus Line"" (which I think deserved every terrible review it received). I dont look for or expect a direct transfer as I know the story will be fleshed out and opened up. However I do appreciate it when they attempt to keep the basic story intact. I liked ""Jersey Boys"" very much on stage and seemed a likely candidate for a big screen treatment and am hoping for a good movie. Reply Song In My Heart Dance In My Step says June 15 2014 at 1003 am Hollywood is in the midst of Re-make-Mania. Wouldnt now be a good time to produce a definitive film version of A CHORUS LINE? Its been nearly 30 years since Attenborough unleashed that stinker - one of the great movie-going disappointments of my movie-loving life. And if they ever do make a proper film version please oh please hire a director who understands (a) Broadway and (b) the film musical form in all of its technical/choreographed complexity. Im undecided if Ill see JERSEY BOYS...J. EDGAR was appalling; the latter made me think Eastwood (whod directed many fine films in the past) should really consider retiring. Reply Chuck D. says June 15 2014 at 540 am My wife and I are so excited to see what Clint has done with this film. We are predisposed to love it...period. Reply TheBigBangOf20thCenturyPopCulture says June 15 2014 at 344 am Translation This movie was too stuck in stereotype land to be about the music. Reply Julienne says June 19 2014 at 513 pm Its about M-U-SI-C-I-A-N-S....I hope so.

Summer Movie Problem (Video) LA Film Festival A Feast of Indie Movies With a Side of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum Tonys Wrap-Up The Winners the Best Speeches the Showstoppers While the nostalgic film doesnt drag it also never answers the question ""Why spend 134 minutes on the Frankie Valli episode of Behind the Music?"" Almost everyone I know with living parents has gotten the phone call where Mom asks ""Have you seen The Jersey Boys? Your father and I went last night and we loved it."" If youre a fan of harmonic 1960s pop or cars with fins ""Jersey Boys"" will provide a nice evening out at the movies. Its nice. Its entertaining. Its pleasant. Its all the positive adjectives that mean ""not terrible but ultimately negligible."" See video Clint Eastwood Shows Off His Musical Chops in First Jersey Boys Trailer (Video) Clint Eastwood directs the film adaptation of the global stage hit and the movie fulfills the duties of a jukebox musical it works in the hits and it casts singers who make those hits sound virtually identical to the original versions. What the movie doesnt do is answer the question ""Why did I just spend 134 minutes watching the Frankie Valli episode of Behind the Music?"" Valli and the Four Seasons are certainly responsible for more than their share of memorable pop ditties but theres nothing about their lives or their music that makes them more of a biopic candidate than say The Beach Boys or The Kinks or The Ink Spots. It doesnt help that the rougher edges of the story are sanded down whenever possible Were informed immediately by group founder Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) that he and Frankie (John Lloyd Young) had mob ties although its really Tommy whos more connected since hes an errand boy for local made man Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken). Tommy is the driving force behind the band but hes also a hothead who gets deeply into debt with loansharks when hes not going to jail for petty offenses. There are actors out there who could effectively portray a genuine menace while also singing four-part harmony but Piazza isnt one of them. Hes credible as a musician but never as threatening as Norm Waxman (Donnie Kehr) Tommys loanshark. The films other mobsters Walken included come off innocuously as if to say ""Hey these guys had mob ties but not you know the bad kind."" The trajectory of the Four Seasons is one we know from a million rock biopics (and fictional band movies like ""That Thing You Do"" and ""The Commitments) -- the struggle to get signed early success in-fighting familial strife bridge chorus. Screenwriters Marshall Brickman (Woody Allens collaborator on ""Annie Hall"" and ""Manhattan"") and Rick Elice adapting their book of the stage musical keep things moving along even interjecting odd humor at places but they wage an uphill battle against genre conventions. Sometimes the cliches are knowingly funny like when the group gets its name from the neon advertisement for a bowling alley and someone says ""Its a sign"" But then you get songwriter Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) watching ""Ace in the Hole"" on TV with lyricist-producer Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle); when Kirk Douglas slaps Jan Sterling in the Billy Wilder movie Crewe comments ""Big girls dont cry"" and Eastwood does everything but insert a lightbulb going off over Gaudios head. Also read Clint Eastwoods Jersey Boys to Close LA Film Festival Cinematographer Tom Stern a frequent Eastwood collaborator accentuates the films feeling of days gone by by frequently desaturating the colors; sometimes the movie looks like a faded postcard and at other times its all but monochromatic. When the color pops (in Crewes apartment which prominently features an Andy Warhol Campbells Soup painting or in the cheesy reprise-y closing number) Stern makes it count. The performances are mostly engaging from Walkens laid-back Mafioso to Youngs earnest Valli to Doyles showy turn as the openly gay Crewe in a performance that resides perilously on the border (without tipping over) between flamboyantly tongue-in-cheek and ridiculously caricatured. The hits -- including ""Sherry"" ""Big Girls Dont Cry"" ""Walk Like a Man"" ""Cant Take My Eyes Off You"" among many others -- inject some dazzle into the proceedings and theyre mostly presented as performance pieces when the band is touring recording or appearing on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" See video Barbara Walters Could Have Married Clint Eastwood But Was Shut Down at Jersey Boys Premiere (Video) The one attempt to work a song into the plot falls flat; Valli sings ""My Eyes Adored You"" to his young daughter Francine and the song is reprised later as the theme to their fractured relationship. Its forgivable that the tune pops up in the 1960s (even though it wasnt released until 1975) but a song about a childhood crush sounds creepy when its a dad singing it to his child particularly since they leave in the ""Though I never laid a hand on you"" line. One would have assumed you didnt. Theres an airlessness about ""Jersey Boys"" mainly in that Eastwood and the writers never seem particularly interested in reflecting the group against the context of their times. We never hear about the decades controversies or newsworthy incidents or the other groups competing against the Four Seasons for pop supremacy or anything else outside of the bubble of their lives. As such the movie never really makes a case for the Four Seasons being important enough to merit big-screen treatment in the first place. Not that this historical vacuum has kept the show from filling theaters from Broadway to Vegas and beyond nor will it keep its core audience from a nice pleasant entertaining time at the movies. Those more inclined to think of the Four Seasons as a Vivaldi piece or a luxury hotel chain may remain unconvinced. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
