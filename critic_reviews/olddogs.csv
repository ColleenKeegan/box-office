But here goes. The new comedy from some of the folks who brought us ""Wild Hogs"" is badly written and broadly acted shamelessly manipulative and not above stopping by the toilet for a laugh or two. John Travolta and Robin Williams play high-rolling sports marketing partners. Travolta is Charlie -- the womanizing back-slapping tell-the-client-a-funny-story half of the team. Most of the stories (not funny BTW) are about Dan played by Williams at his most downbeat. Sad Dan may be able to close the deal but hes a lonely soul divorced pining over ""South Beach Vicki"" a one-night stand (Kelly Preston) from seven years earlier. The guys are on the verge of their biggest deal ever when Vicki comes back into Dans life. Shes going to jail and oh by the way Dans the father of twins. Would he mind watching them for a few weeks? Surprisingly few of the jokes have to do with the guys interacting with kids. Repeated gags about their age -- the funniest bits come from a mix-up in their daily pill regimen -- and ""Were a couple theyre our kids"" gay jokes pepper the script. The kids (including Travoltas lovely daughter Ella Bleu) are seldom-used props. Theres nothing offensive here. But when the best thing you can say about a comedy is that its harmless you know these ""Old Dogs"" have lost their bite. Utterly.

Starring John Travolta Robin Williams Kelly Preston Seth Green Ella Bleu Travolta Lori Loughlin Matt Dillon Director Walt Becker Running time 128 Release Opened Nov 25 2009  Editorial Review We have reached a point in our moviegoing life where the two most horrifying words a studio can mutter are ""Robin"" and ""Williams."" Im sorry its true. Throw in ""John"" and ""Travolta"" and ""Saw VI"" starts to sound like ""Bambi."" Sure these guys have brought joy to peoples lives over the course of their careers. But watching them phone it in for the alleged comedy ""Old Dogs"" -- directed by Walt Becker of the unspeakable ""Wild Hogs"" -- gives new meaning to the term ""lackluster."" Laughing is the last thing you want to do.Recycling the overly familiar ""instant parent"" theme ""Old Dogs"" has Williams as the movies chief old dog Dan a buttoned-down type whose love life has been far less successful than the high-end sports-marketing firm he runs with Charlie (Travolta). Charlie is of course a far more rakish type than Dan (everything being relative) and when he drags his partner on an ill-considered Miami vacation Dan winds up married to Vicki (Kelly Preston). At some point the new couple sober up and get an annulment (perhaps realizing post-margarita mash-up that Preston is already married to Travolta). But there are consequences to such promiscuous behavior Seven years later Vicki shows up and drops off the two kids that Dan never knew he had.Travolta Williams are mangy Old DogsBy John AndersonWednesday Nov. 25 2009At this point the reviewer feels the urge to write very quickly because anyone whos reading this knowsexactlywhatsgoingtohappen But what you dont know is how ugly its going to get in terms of comedic atrocity. ""Old Dogs"" is rife with crotch gags flatulence and other devices for teasing giggles out of children 10 and under but its not just genuine humor thats lacking here its a sense of purpose. Everything is manicured to the point of insulting perfection -- with the exception of course of the script. Seth Green has a funny bit with a gorilla in a zoo; Matt Dillon whos always good plays a martinet Boy Scout. The connection between these bits? There isnt one. Nor is there any excuse for the way Williams and Travolta then try to worm their way into our hearts pretending that theres something at work beyond the tortured plot turns screaming lazy vulgarity and personality-free children. (Travolta-Preston daughter Ella Bleu plays Dans daughter Emily; Tom Hankss wife Rita Wilson plays a friend of Vicki and gives her whole performance cross-eyed. We know how she feels.)As Oscar Wilde once wrote of Dickenss ""The Olde Curiosity Shoppe"" only someone with a heart of stone could fail to laugh at the death of Little Nell. Which is how one feels watching Williams. When he puts on the sad clown face you may indeed laugh at the tragedy of what happens with success in the movies and in a culture where Americans demand so little. Travolta is simply useless in ""Old Dogs"" but Williams is actively offensive in the puerile manner by which he ties to milk sentimentality out of the wizened teat of ""Old Dogs"" which will leave you howling but only over the cost of the ticket.Anderson is a freelance reviewer.Old Dogs -- (88 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for crude humor.

Old Dogs"" does to the screen what old dogs do to the carpet. Its un- fortunate that only the latter can be taken out and shot. Robin Williams -- its not too soon to warn you that he performs several scenes in his underpants -- and John Travolta play longtime partners in a New York City sports-marketing firm trying to sort out a major deal with a Japanese company. Travolta is a skirt-chaser; Williams is divorced. These Geriatric Maguires find their lives upended when a crazy drunken-weekend marriage by the Williams character seven years ago turns out to have been blessed with two children -- fraternal twins a boy and a girl. He learns this because the woman (Kelly Preston) with whom he had the brief annulled marriage pops up to tell him shes going to jail for a couple of weeks for a conviction in a political protest so hell have to mind the children he didnt know he had. Do they write these scripts in the elevator on the way up? The actors compete to humiliate themselves with a dreary hour or so of slapstick. I call the winner Rita Wilson as the cross-eyed best friend of the Preston character who gets her fingers mashed when Williams slams a trunk closed on them. Possibly the most surprised member of the cast though is the gorilla at the zoo. The boys accidentally find themselves in the beasts enclosure while trying to break into the zoo to celebrate the kids birthdays. (See rhetorical query at end of paragraph four.) The gorilla must have taken one look at Williams and thought ""Ive never seen so much body hair."" Seth Green as the marketing firms tiny junior executive (has he always been this small? His dimensions are somewhere between garden gnome and dashboard ornament) almost made me laugh (it would have been the only time in the movie) when the gorilla cuddles him like a long-lost child and he sings ""All Out of Love"" to try to calm the animal. ""Old Dogs"" itself gives off an ancient odor thanks to a scene shot more than two years ago in the now-vanished Shea Stadium and another starring the departed Bernie Mac. Its a rumination on the wisdom and trials of aging told via a poignant series of pratfalls golf balls smashing into crotches misadventures with bear poop and sphincter noises. Whenever the film gets in the vicinity of a good idea -- Williams is so awkward around children he shakes his daughters hand to say good night -- it slobbers all over it Williams announces ""I just shook my daughters hand good night."" We know. The oddest aspect is that while Williams and Travolta may indeed be washed up (though I hope not) theyre not old enough (or grumpy enough) to do a 1990s Lemmon-and-Matthau shtick. Would waiters immediately assume neither of them could possibly be the dad of 7-year-olds -- then bust out an embarrassing musical tribute to grandparents? Did Travolta find that scene especially odd given that one of the kids is played by his own real-life daughter? These actors should worry less about their age and more about sniffing out a decent script. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Got guests?

(AP / Disney / Phillips) Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday November 25 2009 201 AM Title Wheres Eddie Murphy when we need him? No he couldnt have made ""Old Dogs"" any better but he might have talked John Travolta and Robin Williams out of making it at all.Murphy after all was smart enough to pass on a return trip to ""Daddy Day Care"" allowing Cuba Gooding Jr. to take his place for the witless ""Daddy Day Camp."" Travolta should have made the same decision when his ""Wild Hogs"" director Walt Becker suggested teaming up for another juvenile jaunt through middle-aged madness. Travolta who delivers an impressively enthusiastic performance seems to have no idea that hes stuck in one of the years worst movies. The perpetually pained expression on Williams face however suggests he knows otherwise. Travolta and Williams play Charlie and Dan business partners and best friends living in New York (represented here as the worlds most generic city). Out of nowhere Dans ex-wife and eternal crush (Kelly Preston) shows up with a surprise 7-year-old twins (Conner Rayburn Ella Bleu Travolta) he never knew he had. She drops them off for two weeks and its up to our aging bachelors to figure out how to run a family. Screenwriters David Diamond and David Weissman dont bring any new tricks to this old dog; instead their method is to replace all recognizable human behavior with synthetic Hollywood formula. Though Ella Bleu is Preston and Travoltas daughter the kids make little impact since they exist primarily to set up jokes about their incompetent elders. Medication incontinence and death are all enlisted as punch lines though none of course serves as the comedic high point represented by a series of hits to the groin. Becker drags several talented actors down with his leads including Seth Green Amy Sedaris Matt Dillon and the late Bernie Mac. But its especially dispiriting to see Williams looking so tired and embarrassed. He should keep Cuba Goodings number on speed-dial in case Becker tries to enlist him again. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The great thing about comedy these days is that few people are making movies like ""Old Dogs."" The picture is a throwback to an old comic style in which every element is false the friendship of the two protagonists their relationships with women their business behavior their thoughts their sentiments their deepest emotions ... Every aspect of story is distorted to serve up laughs which are mostly tepid or nonexistent. Meanwhile everything is predictable and moments that are supposed to pay off dramatically just hang there shapes in place of scenes. And yet this is the weird thing ""Old Dogs"" is not that bad. Thats often the odd thing about this kind of comedy. The whole movie is a study in compromise. Theres no inspiration behind it only the desire to be mildly pleasing. Theres no truth in it only the desire again to be mildly pleasing. Then throw in two engaging actors in this case John Travolta and Robin Williams and thats what you get not something good or close to good or even residing in a distant suburb of good yet something vaguely but undeniably pleasant. There are four or five good laughs in this movie and one of those has to do with a guy getting hit by a golf ball in that most sensitive of male areas just so you know the level were dealing with here. Travolta and Williams play business partners on the verge of the deal of a lifetime when one of them (Williams) finds out that he has a pair of fraternal twins he didnt know about. Apparently he married and divorced their mother (Travoltas wife Kelly Preston) over the course of 24 hours in Las Vegas eight years earlier and now he has to babysit them. For two weeks.

Travolta and Williams babysit two 7-year-olds. To the movies credit the kids arent brats by any means and the little girl played by Travolta and Prestons real-life daughter (Ella Bleu Travolta) is particularly adorable. So why does Williams look so depressed in this movie playing a man who finds out he has two nice kids by a beautiful woman? Is there any circumstance onscreen in which Williams wouldnt look depressed - hitting the lottery? Winning the Nobel Prize? Travolta is more cheerful and has some of the better comic moments but he also has the most excruciating scenes in which he has to regale potential clients with funny stories - only the stories that the script provides are never funny. Bernie Mac shows up in a small role and as soon as he does the audience forgets everything other than the fact that Bernie Mac is dead. Then the audience starts thinking about Williams recent heart surgery and the fact that Travolta and Preston lost a son in January (and that Ella Travolta lost a brother). Thats a lot of misfortune in a short time and its hard to return to the movie. Still if ""Old Dogs"" were better it might have been easier. -- Advisory Some rude humor. Old Dogs Comedy.

It also serves as a two-word review.Ella Bleu Travolta Robin Williams and Conner Rayburn in Old Dogs.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterWed. Nov. 25 2009 (out of 4)Starring John Travolta Robin Williams and Kelly Preston. Directed by Walt Becker. 88 minutes. At major theatres. G Old Dogs is more than just the title of what amounts to a John Travolta family employment opportunity with contributions from a shockingly unfunny Robin Williams. It also serves as a two-word review.Article Continued BelowDisney has dusted off Old Dogs to send it limping into theatres to try to recoup some coin over American Thanksgiving. How old is it? Bernie Mac who died in August 2008 has a cringe-making bit part as a puppeteer named Jimmy Lunchbox. And co-star Williams has a minor meltdown because his fax machine (remember those?) is unplugged thereby interrupting his ability to do business. Oh and yes the movie is a dog.Best buds and sports marketing gurus Charlie (Travolta as the skirt chaser) and Dan (Williams the child-phobic) are living carefree lives until Dan suddenly learns hes the father of 7-year-old twins. Theyre the product of drunken quickie wedding sex on a lost weekend.And now the twins mom Vicki (Travoltas wife Kelly Preston) suddenly reappears in Dans life to announce shes off to jail for two weeks for an act of community-minded civil disobedience and needs a babysitter.The twins are played by Conner Rayburn - a clever cutie with droll delivery hes the best thing about the movie - and Travoltas daughter Ella Bleu a pretty little girl but sadly with extremely limited acting skills.Dans quest to bond with his kids involves Charlie and the tiresome plot sees the guys mistaken for gay partners and grandparents tearing up a summer camp (with Matt Dillon as a deranged counsellor) and breaking into a zoo where they tangle with aggressive penguins. Along the way are the requisite fart jokes poop jokes and unfortunate males getting whacked in the dangly bits plus too many scenes with a paunchy shirtless Williams.Its sad in the extreme to see Saturday Night Fever stud Tony Manero (Travolta) downing prostate medication which becomes part of an elaborate gag on old guys mixing up their meds. Theres a lazy feel to the movie the latest from Wild Hogs director Walt Becker. Unfunny and uninspired this dog deserves to be put down.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Its a dog all right with no new tricks Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Nov. 24 2009 233PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Old Dogs Directed by Walt Becker Written by David Diamond and David Weissman Starring John Travolta and Robin Williams Classification G Imagine a mash-up of Grumpy Old Men and Daddy Day Care and brace yourself for Old Dogs  a new ""family comedy"" starring John Travolta and Robin Williams as middle-aged bachelors who find themselves in charge of seven-year-old twins. The movie is directed by Walt Becker the man behind the 2007 Travolta comedy Wild Hogs  a movie notable only for the discrepancy between its critical trouncing and its quarter-of-a-billion-dollar box-office take. Similarly themed and titled Old Dogs looks like a safe bet to score with the weekend mall crowds - a story about babysitting seven-year-olds thats designed to do exactly that. As well its a family movie starring a family With Travoltas real-life wife (Kelly Preston) and daughter (Ella Bleu Travolta) co-starring its a family movie in both senses. Travolta brokered his star appeal into a series of similar kid-friendly movies in the late eighties (the Look Whos Talking series) before Quentin Tarantino rescued his career by casting him in Pulp Fiction . Here he plays Charlie a bachelor and self-styled swinger whose only family is of course his old dog. Hes the affable front man for a New York-based boutique sports-marketing firm where his neurotic partner Dan (Robin Williams cast against type) does the detail work. On the eve of landing a big contract with a Japanese company Dan learns he is the father of seven-year-old twins conceived during a one-day marriage with a woman named Vicki (Preston) whom he met during a drunken vacation. When Vicki has to do some jail time on an environmental-protest charge Dan and Charlie end up as babysitters for the doleful Zach (Conner Rayburn) and sensitive Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta). The rest of the movie consists of thinly connected slapstick sequences and contrived visual gags. Charlie convinces Dan to go to a tanning salon to meet his former wife and - wouldnt you know it? - Dan ends up such a deep mahogany hue an Indian man mistakes him for a countryman. Then - surprise - the kids remember theyre supposed to go to a military-style camp for the weekend allowing Matt Dillon and Justin Long to pop up in cameos as survivalist nutbars. The oddest scenes include one in which the kids mix up Charlie and Dans prescription drugs leading to peculiar side effects including giving Travolta a grisly computer-created Joker-like smile. (Kids playing with their webcams at home are likely to be familiar with face-bending software so the effect shouldnt be too freaky.) Wearing his hideous smile Charlie crashes a bereavement group (allowing appearances from Ann-Margret and Full House s Lori Loughlin). The late Bernie Mac appears as a childrens entertainer in the movies most miscalculated scene in which he attempts to teach Dan how to have a tea party with his daughter by hooking him up to a remote-controlled suit. In other sequences familiar from the movies trailer Dan and Charlie sneak into the zoo where their assistant (Seth Green) gets adopted by a gorilla and Dan and Charlie are attacked by angry penguins. The timing of the comic set-ups is consistently amateurish as if scenes were edited with hedge clippers with the actors mugging frantically waiting for the take to end. Apart from a couple of mildly wince-worthy ethnic and gay jokes though Old Dogs is offensive mostly because it wastes time. While watching the movie - making mental to-do lists counting change in my pocket and trying to remember lyrics to the Motown tune on the soundtrack - I had a brief glimmer of hope. Wont the series run out of rhymes? Whats left after Wild Hogs and Old Dogs ? Bull Frogs? Bumps on a Log? Then I recalled the curse of the sequel Sure enough Wild Hogs 2 is scheduled for release in 2011. At this rate Travolta could be hogging and dogging it well into the next decade.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Old Dogs Video Rated PG  2009 A total train wreck this patronizing comedy from Walt Becker (Wild Hogs) stars John Travolta and Robin Williams as two businessmen both pushing 60 who get stuck babysitting a pair of seven-year-old twins. Most of the jokes revolve around old people gay people and various bodily functions. Especially painful is a CGI sequence in which a medication mix-up leaves Travoltas smile contorted into a Joker-like rictus; its an unfortunate reminder of the face-lifts many stars undergo in order to keep working in garbage like this.

ABOUT THE MOVIEOld Dogs1/2 (out of four) Stars John Travolta Robin Williams Kelly Preston Seth Green Rita WilsonDirector Walt BeckerDistributor Walt Disney EntertainmentRating PG for some mild rude humorRunning time 1 hour 28 minutesOpens today nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Old Dogs has no new tricks. But there are predictable yuks. And then there are the other yucks bathroom humor involving humans canines and other critters. Still the chemistry between Robin Williams and John Travolta playing business partners and best pals makes this formulaic comedy a notch better than its premise indicates. Travolta is Charlie a fun-loving playboy. He loves the ladies but his heart belongs to his old dog. Williams Dan is twice-divorced pining for the one who got away. That would be ex-wife Vicki (Kelly Preston). Their marriage was an impulse vow conceived after a night of partying and ended after both sobered up. Vicki agrees to meet Dan. But to satisfy banal comic requirements Dan must first do something certain to make their meeting awkward. Cue the tanning-salon mishap. This sequence borders on offensive. Dan is meant to look ridiculous but dark-skinned people take him for one of their own. What a laugh riot. Did we mention that Vickis best buddy (Rita Wilson) is a cross-eyed hand model and that Dan nearly ends her career? Because her friend can no longer lend a hand Dan offers to take Vickis twins Emily and Zach (Ella Bleu Travolta and Conner Rayburn) for two weeks just after he learns hes their dad. Geezer jokes slapstick segments and contrivances arise. The story has been done to death Die-hard bachelor forced to take on adorable children. Silly antics ensue followed by a conclusion bathed in sentimentality. This is not the Travolta of Pulp Fiction nor is it the Williams of One Hour Photo. Though no animals were harmed in the making of Old Dogs the lead actors were defanged. But like a pair of Labradors they have a playful rapport.

Rita Wilson turns up as a cross-eyed hand model. The stars end up stuck in a gorilla enclosure with a shrieking Seth Green and a guy in an ape suit.

Share Tweet Making a movie aimed at kids gives filmmakers license for a lot of things butt jokes and poop jokes of course--you cant have one without the other--but also reaction shots of cute animals and montage sequence after montage sequence. But its one thing to make a movie with simpler tastes in mind and another to make one insulting even to half-formed little brains. Old Dogs the latest from the director of Wild Hogs casts Robin Williams and John Travolta as longtime business partners--the former divorced the latter a lifelong bachelor--who have to team up to care for a pair of fraternal twins Williams sired during a brief fling. Only it isnt really about that. Instead its about discovering how little connective tissue something needs in order for it to still be a film. Largely forgetting the kids as it subjects its stars to one humiliation after another Old Dogs doesnt even have the courage to commit to its familiar but serviceable premise. Two And A Half Men has gotten seven seasons and counting out of the same basic setup and character types but here director Walt Becker flits restlessly from one contrived scenario to the next sticking around only long enough to reach outcomes even the slowest children will see coming. In the space between the moment where Matt Dillons macho troop leader gets teary-eyed over an ancestors statue and the moment where said statue gets destroyed a generation can learn the meaning of the word ""hackneyed."" Perhaps sensing that they havent landed in the contemporary descendent of The Red Balloon or even Three Men And A Baby Williams Travolta and a supporting cast that includes Seth Green and the late Bernie Mac mug as if theyre getting to try on facial expressions like ""shock"" and ""mortification"" for the last time and they want to get the most out of the moment. Theyre shameless performances in a movie not above resorting to siccing penguins on Travoltas crotch for laughs or staging a dogs funeral for pathos. Adults should steer clear. Kids should be sent to it only if theyve been extraordinarily naughty.

On that score it meets expectations. Nor do you expect a formula buddy comedy about men of a certain age to provoke belly laughs. On that score however Old Dogs exceeds (admittedly low) expectations.From Walt Becker maker of Wild Hogs comes this situation comedy about longtime business partners happy-go-lucky ladies man (John Travolta) and unlucky-in-love schlemiel (Robin Williams). It runs a fast 88 minutes is broad as the waistlines of its stars and is remarkably family-friendly if you dont mind bathroom humor. For in addition to its old-dog stars there are young puppies One is Travoltas adorable apple-cheeked daughter Ella Bleu.The premise Can childless workaholic men emotionally bound to their BlackBerries (and professionally to each other) handle two fatherless 7-year-olds for two weeks without jeopardizing their own careers or the kids welfare?Like so many family films (including Williams Mrs. Doubtfire and Hook) this one is engineered both to assuage the guilt of absentee fathers and to appease their neglected spawn. For the less-than-dutiful dad Hollywood prescribes the story of the father (or in this case father surrogate) who overcompensates for absence not by presence but by fulfilling kid fantasies.Charlie Reed (Travolta twinkling) and Dan Rayburn (Williams hangdog) are in marketing. Charlie has never married. Dan is twice-divorced. During a week where they might land a big corporate fish they are tapped as temporary caregivers to two children (Ella Bleu Travolta and Conner Rayburn).Early on the film firmly establishes that Dan is a hazard to anyone under four feet. And that as klutzy and gravity-bound as Dan is thats how smooth and airy Charlie comes off.Predictable as the premise is Travoltas and Williams unpredictability makes for some chortle-worthy slapstick less of Laurel amp; Hardy vintage than of Abbott amp; Costello swill.Whenever the pace lags theres a cameo (from Matt Dillon Justin Long Seth Green the late Bernie Mac) that adds zip. A child of 5 can see that these brief appearances serve to pad a gauze-thin script.No matter. Old Dogs may not be good. But the sight of pesky penguins pecking Travolta and Green in the embrace of an unlikely partner makes it just good enough.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crockeyphillynews.com.

"Old Dogs | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; old-dogs ) Old Dogs (United States 2009) November 24 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Heres a primer for how to endure Old Dogs if an unfortunate series of circumstances should place you where seeing it is unavoidable. Arrive late and leave early. In between visit the concession stand as frequently as possible and stand in the longest lines. Drink a gallon of water beforehand so multiple visits to the restroom are mandatory. Hopefully this will limit your exposure to a level where Old Dogs loses its toxicity and is merely uncomfortable although Im not sure thats possible. More tests are needed but there are some experiences no one should be subjected to even in the name of science. It may be that forced viewing of this film has been outlawed by the Geneva Convention. Much has been made about how family films like Where the Wild Things Are and A Christmas Carol are too mature for younger children. The inverse is true of Old Dogs which is too infantile for anyone who can speak in full sentences. As for the rest of the potential audience... Theyll probably appreciate it but many of them enjoy eating paste so that establishes a baseline level of taste. To be frank eating paste would probably be less likely to induce vomiting that sitting through the entirety of this motion picture abomination. Old Dogs makes Wild Hogs the predecessor of its director Walt Becker appear Oscar worthy. Whats wrong with this movie? A better question might be Whats right? Every attempt at comedy is not only obvious but delivered in such a forced manner that any hope of generating laughter dies before the joke has been told. Old Dogs also attempts to include its share of dramatic moments; these are about as well conceived as Rob Schneider doing Shakespeare. Side effects of watching Old Dogs mawkish melodrama range from eyeball rolling to uncontrolled retching. A pall hangs over Old Dogs. It features the last screen appearance of Bernie Mac whose death resulted in the movies opening being delayed by about six months. Its also the last film John Travolta made before the death of his son Jett. In fact Jett is the only member of the Travolta clan not to have a role in this film. Travoltas wife Kelly Preston plays the lead female and his daughter Ella Bleu is one of the kids. The two ""old dogs"" of the title are best buddies Charlie (Travolta) and Dan (Robin Williams) who have been in business together for 30 years. Now on the eve of signing a huge contract with a Japanese firm Dan discovers that a 24-hour fling seven years ago with Vicki (Kelly Preston) resulted in the birth of fraternal twins Zach (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta). With Emily scheduled to spend two weeks in jail on a civil disobedience charge she needs someone to care for the children. Thats where Dan and Charlie come in. This leads to a series of misadventures involving camping out bear poop dog urine human flatulence golf and a visit to the zoo. Amazingly the filmmakers manage to take situations that should at least have a minimal level of comedic potential and reduce them to where laughter by anyone over the age of four could be construed as a sign of a psychological maladjustment. Perhaps the saddest thing about this movie is reflecting upon how far Robin Williams has fallen as a comedian. Once one of the funniest men in Hollywood Williams has been reduced to this. (To be fair he has shown strong dramatic chops - his performance in the dark comedy Worlds Greatest Dad is a testimony to that.) Its easy to see the attraction for Travolta since the involvement of his wife and daughter allowed him to spend more time with the family. He should have just submitted a few home movies instead and spared us the agony of Old Dogs. Supporting players include Seth Green as a junior member of Charlie and Dans firm Lori Laughlin as a love interest for Charlie and Matt Dillon as a camp director. If theres anything significant about Old Dogs its that it illustrates how diminished Thanksgiving weekend has become for movie releases. Once this was deemed the fourth biggest time of the year for opening films (after Memorial Day Christmas and July 4). Now its a dumping ground. With good reason Disney has little faith in this movies performance - theyre releasing it against their own A Christmas Carol and it will soon be joined by The Princess and the Frog. Perhaps like old soldiers Old Dogs will fade away - although not matter how quickly it does that it wont be fast enough.

But then 6-year-old boys laugh at the word poop -- and the word poop plays a big steaming part in this stinky endeavor. So does the sight of Japanese businessmen getting hit in the crotch with golf clubs. And the sound of Robin Williams dignity flushing further down the pipes. Williams and John Travolta play old pals in their 50s a cartoonish sad-sack divorce and a cartoonish bachelor swinger respectively whose odd-couple routines are upended by the arrival of 7-year-old fraternal twins that Williams character never knew he had. (Travoltas wife Kelly Preston plays the kids mom and Ella Bleu Travolta debuts as the girl twin.) Exhausted as the premise already is -- hapless boomer learns that real manhood is a function of committed fatherhood -- Old Dogs nevertheless finds ways to make the lesson even less tolerable. Directed by Walt Becker (who handled Travolta in Wild Hogs with similar material) the movie includes an interminable scene of the men taking the wrong medications for their various boomer ailments with weirdly horrible comedic side effects. In other awful interludes they and their many ill-used guest stars are shot in disfiguring close-ups. The late comedy king Bernie Mac (who died in August 2008) is among those guests a clue that this movie is an old dog indeed.

(Courtesy of Disney)""Wild Hogs"" ""Old Dogs"" -- whats next ""Bumps on Logs""? Truly I would rather watch John Travolta and Robin Williams sitting on a tree trunk doing nothing than endure their best efforts to energize this ol hound. Does no one know how to film physical comedy anymore? In the latest Disney live-action comedy people are constantly getting their fingers crushed by car-trunk lids or getting clocked in the groin by golf balls and undergoing grotesque facial distortions owing to the wrong medication. And none of it is funny. Its all pain and no funny. Director Walt Becker who brought a similar level of blunt artlessness to ""Wild Hogs"" (also co-starring Travolta) shoots the movie for maximum unfocused frenzy. The way the footage has been edited by Tom Lewis and Ryan Folsey every conversation every moment is hacked into erratic overemphasis. ""Nervous"" is the word. The performers sensing (rightly) some issues with their script act like preteen ninnies on a sugar high. The premise recalls the American remake (co-starring Williams) of ""Les Comperes"" which was called ""Fathers Day"" and which few remember fondly. Seven years after his whirlwind 24-hour marriage to Vicki (Kelly Preston) an uptight Felix Unger-esque fellow named Dan (Williams) learns hes the father of twins. For reasons Hollywood pays screenwriters a fair bit of money to establish Dan and his best friend and business partner footloose bachelor Charlie (Travolta) end up baby-sitting these two for a couple of weeks. Well Camping trip ends in flames. Big deal with Japanese business partners crisis. Dan is a sad sack; Charlie is obnoxious; the jokes come back cyclically to ""grandpa"" gags as often as they come back to the ""were not gay"" gags. It may well be a popular success as was ""Wild Hogs."" But when you get to the sequence featuring the late Bernie Mac as a puppeteer controlling Williams every move as he pretends to be a fairy-tale king having a tea party with his daughter (Ella Bleu Travolta) youre thinking what? The labored premise of this setup is not worth the effort -- its sort of icky both as humor and as pathos. Good will generated by familiar faces cannot overcome all obstacles. This is the lesson of the film and better scripts and directors to all next time.RelatedPhotos ""Old Dogs""MPAA rating PG (for some mild rude humor)Cast John Travolta (Charlie); Robin Williams (Dan); Kelly Preston (Vicki); Conner Rayburn (Zach); Ella Bleu Travolta (Emily); Lori Laughlin (Amanda); Seth Green (Craig); Bernie Mac (Jimmy Lunchbox); Matt Dillon (Barry).

Posted at 085800 AM in Reviews Comments I guess the funniest thing to do to a man is smack him in the Family Jewels. Oh this is sooo funny. What would be the comparable action foisted upon a woman? How long would this be funny? But men can get whacked in tv moviesand especially in beer commercials for humorous effect. Ouch it isnt funny. Posted by JeffT | November 29 2009 at 0554 PM surely grumpyoldmans comment must be a joke... right? Posted by rob | November 27 2009 at 1106 AM i watched one of recent action packed movie and it made me upset as now i am hating to watch action movies. then i watched drama genre adaptation it was really good. then i watched comedy movie Old Dogs . yeah it was perfect .i laughed and laughed . it was nice to see John Travolta Robin Williams in Old Dogs movie. source http//blog.80millionmoviesfree.com/in-theaters/watch-old-dogs-online Posted by WERANDLY | November 27 2009 at 0403 AM After all the emotional pain Mr. Travolta has endured the past year it is unconscionable for you to criticize his art in such a haughty dismissive manor.

John Travolta and Robin Williams make an amiable team as middle-age bachelors suddenly handed parental duties in ""Old Dogs."" Too bad this shrilly tuned comedy doesnt demand more than clock-punching effort from everyone involved. Nonetheless as Travolta and helmer Walt Beckers prior Mouse House exercise ""Wild Hogs"" proved theres an underserved audience out there ready for unchallenging laughs with familiar faces and little or no Judd Apatow-style raunch. Prospects look solid. Lifelong friends who co-own a Manhattan-based sports marketing firm Charlie (Travolta) and Dan (Robin Williams) have passed the age of likely fatherhood which is fine since neither feels any particular affinity for kids. Charlie is an unrepentant womanizer while Dan is the veteran of two failed marriages -- the latter a drunken Miami rebound affair quickly annulled. But seven years later that second ex-wife Vicki (Kelly Preston) suddenly shows up with the news that Dan is in fact the father of her twins. Since Vicki is about to do two weeks jailtime for trespassing in an environmental protest she figures this as good a time as any for Dad to spend quality time with 7-year-olds Zach (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta Johns daughter). Then an unfortunate accident sidelines Vickis best friend (Rita Wilson) necessitating that Dan step in as the fortnights full-time babysitter. Charlie becomes this awkward new familys reluctant host when Dan gets bounced from his no-children-allowed condo. Script by David Diamond and David Weissman is formulaic in outline yet almost arbitrary in detail lurching from one half-baked slapstick setpiece to the next. These include a camping expedition with Matt Dillon as a humorless troupe leader (plus an unbilled Justin Long as a psycho fellow dad); a golf game with Japanese executives (Saburo Shimono Kevin W. Yamada) in which balls repeatedly hit groins; a silly ""human puppet"" episode involving the late Bernie Mac (to whom the pic is dedicated alongside Travoltas late son Jett); and a zoo climax that gets Dan airborne Charlie attacked by penguins and an office associate (Seth Green) adopted by a gorilla. Its unclear whether the often frantic editing by Tom Lewis and Ryan Folsey prevents these scenes from building any rhythm or represents an attempt at salvage. In any case theres a haphazardness to the goings-on here Holes in logic and pacing are routinely plugged by incontinence jokes pop-soundtrack cues and a whole lot of canine reaction shots from Charlies actual old dog. Latter gets more screentime than any number of often bewilderingly underused name talents including Ann-Margret (one scene) Amy Sedaris (a couple of lines) and the unbilled Dax Shepard and Luis Guzman. While supporting players are often pushed to hit very broad notes the stars manage whenever possible to seem in relaxed form. Though neither is exactly moved to contribute memorable work here their different comedic styles are complementary. They seem to be having fun -- and for all the films routine and/or sloppy aspects ""Old Dogs"" will likely convince audiences out for a disposable good time that theyre having fun too. Look is the usual bright-and-bland palette of current studio comedies. John Debneys original score is most noticeable when underlining the expected occasional maudlin moments.

Old Dogs Bomb to bad Director Walt Becker. Cast John Travolta Robin Williams Kelly Preston. Rating PG for mild rude humor. RELATED Spotlight John Travolta Disney/Pixar movies movies Which is not much. Director Walt Beckers film goes for humor and heart achieving neither. Thats largely due to the script by David Diamond and David Weissman (sorry guys Im sure youd rather have remained anonymous). It sputters from one lame scene to the next sometimes bothering with a transition sometimes not. Plot devices come and go but most are weak enough - an extra-dark spray-on tan? - that it doesnt really matter. Williams and Travolta are both good actors capable of excellent work. Theyre also capable of treacle. Guess which you get here? Charlie (Travolta) and Dan (Williams) have been best friends for 30 years. They own a sports-marketing business with the impulsive Charlie and the uptight Dan playing off each other to great success. (""Playing off"" usually involves Charlie telling embarrassing stories about Dan to potential clients.) On the cusp of landing their biggest account one that will set them up for life they get a surprise Vicki (Kelly Preston the real-life Mrs. Travolta) to whom Dan was once married for a few hours after getting tanked the same day he got divorced shows up. With twins. Dans twins. Hello Daddy. Vicki has to spend two weeks in prison for prostitution and . . . just kidding. This is a Disney movie. She was protesting the building of an environmentally suspect plant near a stream and convicted of trespassing. Through Dans ineptitude her babysitter lands in the hospital. If only someone could keep them. . . . No. Yes. Of course. While working through their biggest account Dan and Charlie will also have to keep the kids Dan didnt know he had. And not just keep them. They have a list of all the things they want out of a dad. Their plan is to mow through them in the next two weeks. You know the drill from here. The kids screw up the business deal Except they dont Or something Seeing Williams play the button-down straight man might have been intriguing - 15 or 20 years ago. Now? He just seems sort of tired. The checks still cash the same though. What other reason is there for doing a movie like this (a question that extends to the supporting cast which includes Matt Dillon Justin Long and Seth Green)? Even Ann-Margret the late Bernie Mac and the great Amy Sedaris show up and are quickly dispensed with. Watching the predictable lazy ""Old Dogs"" you cant help but think about the great Michael Caine line about why such a great actor would appear in ""Jaws The Revenge."" Hes never seen it he explained and he understands its terrible. But the house it paid for was fabulous. Lets hope Williams Travolta and the rest got a fabulous payday for ""Old Dogs.""
