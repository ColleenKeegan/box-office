The Maze Runner adapted from the first novel in a series by James Dashner takes a Lord of the Flies setting of boys fending for themselves in the great outdoors and chucks in some Lost-style sci-fi. Sixteen-year-old Thomas (Dylan OBrien) wakes up in a field known as The Glade remembering only his name. For three years boys have been arriving here at a rate of one a month and say what you like about crap teenagers but this lot are doing all right for themselves farming building shelters even herding goats. Surrounding The Glade is a giant mechanised labyrinth that changes pattern every night. Thomas joins the maze runners a squad of super-fit kids who spend all day mapping the maze and dodging enormous venomous spiders. The boys are shocked when the next arrival after Thomas is a girl (Kaya Scodelario) who shows up with a note in her hand She will be the last. Why are the boys there? Who built the maze? What does the WCKD organisation have to do with it all? The Maze Runner outruns most of the competition on the YA pitch. Whats missing perhaps is the force that propels The Hunger Games films. But the acting is superb and bravo the filmmakers for not throwing in a drippy teen romance. Entertaining but never quite thrilling this actually feels like the second film in a franchise coasting along but saving the best bits for the next episode.

"Small(er) Movie Roundup Now Big Enough to Include Americas YA Movie Flavor of the Week << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup Now Big Enough to Include Americas YA Movie Flavor of the Week Twentieth Century Fox Movies September 24 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print The Maze Runner directed by Wes Ball As a genre these young-adult dystopian adventure movies are starting to collapse on themselves. Or maybe theyre collapsing on me. Or Im collapsing on them I think I have a touch of apocalepsy -- excessive sleepiness caused by prolonged exposure to three- and four-part series in which adolescents rebel against oppressive governments represented by esteemed actors. It doesnt matter that James Dashners books were published before Suzanne Collinss. This movie exists because The Hunger Games movies do. By now it really does feel like weve been here before and its fair to wonder how many more times well have to go back. The Maze Runner is like a boys recess set at an adult-free summer camp. (A lone girl eventually enters the scene.) The youths live in a clearing surrounded by enormous concrete walls on the other side of which is a labyrinth guarded by killer flesh-and-metal bugs. One day into the clearing pops Thomas (Dylan OBrien) who proceeds to turn from a passive ""greenie"" into the multiracial communitys alpha determined to lead them out of the maze. The action sequences have a disturbingly graphic muscularity (one character blows his brains out; another spears a bad guy). The downtimes got some comedy and OBrien with his giraffes neck works as a hero (he just looks chosen). But that aforementioned apocalepsy sets in almost immediately. Its exhausting knowing that a mash-up of Lord of the Flies The Goonies and the wardrobe department of Newsies exists beneath an Orwellian dome -- and that the dome will require at least two more movies to lift. Once President Esteemed Actress shows up you wonder whether these series are to the Winslets and Streeps of the world what Marvel movies are to Scarlett Johansson currency. Anyway its not as if these movies are really about the end of the world (although there is a World Catastrophe Kill Zone Department). The exposition that clogs up the last 20 minutes lays out a depressing idealization of testing skill sets and leadership that culminates in backhanded praise for being exceptional pupils. What weve got here is an entitlement narrative. These kids are fighting to save whats left of civilization but they might as well be trying to get into the hardest college on earth. The Zero Theorem directed by Terry Gilliam What these teen dystopias need is more Terry Gilliam. Hes been doing the end of everything for decades and he could use some new nightmares. In The Zero Theorem he offers what amounts to a jeremiad (written by Pat Rushin) against the omnipresence and omnipotence of digital technology and the corporate entities that control it. The film is set in a world of big spaces and audiovisual farce -- miles of art direction the pumping doink of gears and hissing of gas and over-the-top gesticulations from scores of flamboyantly dressed extras. Its Franz Kafka dreaming in Willy Wonkas bed. A completely hairless Christoph Waltz plays Qohen Leth a programmer functionary at a business called Mancom -- not a gay dating site but a company of ""endless possibility."" Leth waits for his landline to ring and for whoevers on the other end to offer a key to happiness. In the meantime he sees a virtual shrink (Tilda Swinton doing her Yorkshire bit from Snowpiercer here too) becomes obsessed with a woman (Melanie Thierry) who rescues him when he chokes at a party and befriends the teenage computer-whiz son of the corporate overlord (Matt Damon with a gray crew cut). Where these relationships go is nowhere new surprising or especially deep. Some of the technology deployed -- enormous smartphone screens virtual reality -- is tiresomely familiar. But the movies allergic reaction to totalitarianism particularly as a goal of big business does culminate in a touching final image. This is the last installment of what Gilliam has called his Orwellian trilogy (Brazil and Twelve Monkeys precede it). This movie has a similarly fanciful air of paranoia and depression even though its missing the philosophical and thematic grandeur of its predecessors. The cultures caught up to Gilliam. Everybodys doing Orwell now. But Gilliams appropriation feels both aptly skeptical and unfashionably utopian. Forget the smartphone. Hed rather swipe at the sun. The Drop directed by Michael R. Roskam Dennis Lehane adapted his own short story (""Animal Rescue"") in which a low-rent underworld shoot-em-up meets first-time dog ownership. Its involving but not enough to keep me from noticing how much of the advancement of the plot depends on shadiness failing to adequately recognize shadiness. Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini play Bob and Marv two Brooklyn guys who work in a bar Marv used to own. Now Chechen gangsters use it as a cash drop for the various arms of their organization. Bob has a manner as soft as sweatpants. He happens upon a puppy roughed up and left in the trash and winds up taking care of it. The woman (Noomi Rapace) giving him canine-care tips appears to have had some kind of relationship with the jittery creep (Matthias Schoenaerts) whos stalking Bob and maybe the puppy. Marv meanwhile looks to be up to the kind of no-good business that a certain class of crook and gangster never seems smart enough to avoid. Soon most of the characters are in over their heads and the body count rises. Roskam directed the constantly improving Schoenaerts in the 2011 Belgian crime thriller Bullhead. That was a more overheated cousin to this new movie which has the seediness youve come to expect from something set around a mob-owned bar. Lehane writes some sharp funny exchanges but the longer the movie goes on the less original it becomes and the harder it is to believe -- even with Hardy doing a legible alluring variation on Marlon Brando. His mumbling is the meat and potatoes of the movies accent stew. (John Ortiz Michael Aronov Elizabeth Rodriguez James Frecheville and Ann Dowd toss in ripe vegetables of their own.) This is a movie you stumble across when hunting for something to watch goodish with the right dreary atmosphere. Gandolfini is captivating too and not because this was his final performance (the movie holds no romance for him) but because he was the rare actor who could transform inconsistency into a dramatic inner contradiction. He gives illogic a malicious sting one last time. The Skeleton Twins directed by Craig Johnson Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader play Maggie and Milo estranged suicidal twins who are reunited after he tries to kill himself. The script by director Craig Johnson and Mark Heyman does move the needle for dysfunctional family dramedy. After his failed suicide attempt Milo moves from Los Angeles to New York to convalesce in the house Maggie shares with her guys-guy husband (Luke Wilson). Everybody has an argument of some kind and Maggies narration opens the movie wondering ""What the hell happened to us?"" I got halfway to ""who cares?"" but Wiig and especially Hader are very good with all the cliches. Its a serious enough movie but theyre not afraid of being funny. The filmmakers think the comedy is where all the humanity is and maybe theyre right. But they dont take humor far enough. Theyre not that interested in the fraying psychologies which comedy could certainly explore. Wiig and Hader make the so-so-TV banalities in the script more tolerable. Theyre the right comedic actors for say a lip-synced rapprochement done to ""Nothings Gonna Stop Us Now."" In another scene they crack each other up at the dentists office where Maggie works. Neither scene throws off the movie but neither seems scripted either. What if theyd winged the rest of the movie too? Also ... Two of my favorite movies of the year are also making their way across America right now. I wrote about both earlier this year and my enthusiasm stands. Pascale Ferrans Bird People is the happiest surprise Ive had in a long time a movie that puts drone technology to brilliant use to tell a story about two people (Josh Charles Anais Demoustier) who separately enjoy a surprising couple of days at an airport hotel. Love Is Strange by Ira Sachs becomes less happy as it goes. After years together two New Yorkers (John Lithgow and Alfred Molina) get married only to suffer a series of circumstantial and cosmic indignities. Its a movie as much about class and family as it is about love and gay marriage. Excuse yourself from whats falling off the assembly line and watch these two films instead.

When your parents generation went to the movies they cracked up at sex comedies and John Hughes. Today Hollywood wants you dead. Between Katniss nightlock berries and The Givers daily dulling injection you can literally pick your poison. In Wes Balls The Maze Runner a grim kiddie dystopia about a pack of boys whove woken up in the middle of a labyrinth with their memories wiped the guys fear ""being stung"" an infection that turns the victim into a violent killer. According to leader Albys (Aml Ameen) rules the tribe must shove the stung into the Maze a mechanical deathtrap filled with murderous metal spiders called Grievers and walls that shift so loudly that the sound design rattles the enamel off your teeth. A few members of the group have been selected as Runners athletes who race through the halls trying to find the exit. The rest are content to stay safe in the center and accept their fate even if that means expelling rebels who disrupt the status quo. Is the true enemy this all-testosterone Lord of the Flies clan? Nah faulting your fellow kids is so 1950s. For the millennials adults gotta be to blame even when we never see them. The Maze Runner is so bleak that it almost convinces us to take it seriously. Dont bother -- James Dashners original novel makes a lot more sense. But Ball gets all the genre beats right adrenaline escapes a hazy anticorporate cynicism and a hero (Dylan OBrien) who is assured from the start that hes Very Special. Hey who cares if todays kids survive a movie as long as their egos are intact.

Dont let that YA tag put you off though. There isnt a dying heroine or hunky vampire to be found anywhere in this better-than-average adaptation of the James Dashner bestseller. Just a bunch of confused kids on the run from a mysterious organization known as W.C.K.D. Dylan OBrien best known as one of the stars of MTVs lycanthropic slice of 80s nostalgia Teen Wolf plays Thomas a young guy who wakes up panting and sweating in an industrial elevator that deposits him in the middle of a verdant field. The place is surrounded on all four sides by towering stone walls and looks like the quad on the campus of the worlds worst party school. Thomas memory has been wiped clean but hes not alone. Greeting him with suspicion are dozens of other Lost Boys in Henley tees who quickly haze him as the ""greenie"" newcomer and fill him in on the laws and castes of their jungle society which they call the Glade. Like him they all arrived from mysterious provenance and have spent their time in confinement trying to figure out a way to escape while running from giant spider-like creatures called Grievers who look only slightly more convincing than the papier mache arachnid that feasted on Mary Anns coconut cream pies on Gilligans Island. Thomas quickly proves to be an invaluable addition to the tribe. Hes curious and brave and he doesnt cower from the Glades resident bully (Were The Millers Will Poulter). Hes such an asset in fact that he takes his place among the most heroic subgroup the Runners. Each day these Runners head off through an ominous passage in the walls and sprint through a maze of byzantine alleyways and deadly obstacles charting its boundaries and searching for a way out. Designed to look like the cement walls of an old Soviet foundry the Maze is an impressive conjuring of both CGI and the imagination and the setting of the films most breathless action sequences. Unlike the spidery Grievers the living breathing labyrinth wows you with a creepy sense of awe. Who built this place? Whats expected of these young prisoners? And what do the ubiquitous initials W.C.K.D. have to do with it all? Thomas needs to know. And when a young woman (Kaya Scoledario) arrives she hints that Thomas may already have a clue as to why hes there...if he could only remember. The first two-thirds of The Maze Runner are a clever feat of fantasy world building. Its thrilling twisty and as mysterious as the mammoth Skinner Box environment the film takes place in. But the promising set-up raises so many puzzle-piece questions that when its all finally explained in the final reel you cant help feeling a bit gypped. Having not read the book I was hoping for a more satisfying payoff than the one I got. Then again maybe the filmmakers are saving the answers for the sequel (which is all but announced during the final scene). Either way I couldnt help thinking Is that all there is?

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 19 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 19 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Wes Ball Written by Noah Oppenheim Grant Pierce Myers and T.S. Nowlin Starring Dylan OBrien Kaya Scodelario Classification PG Country USA Language English In a glade in the middle of a forest three dozen youths have built themselves a subsidence society governed by simple rules of community and security. Everybody works together nobody harms another and nobody leaves - unless they have been selected as one of the elite runners whose quest is to map the towering concrete maze that surrounds their peaceful glade keeping the boys prisoner. Thomas wakes up one day to find that a freight elevator has somehow deposited him in this rather timid apocalyptic sci-fi tale adapted from the young adult novel by James Dashner. The story clearly harkens back to dystopian classics such as Lord of the Flies and Animal Farm but contemporary viewers will probably judge it only as a less sexy version of The Hunger Games.The striving Thomas played with painful earnestness by Dylan OBrien is only a ""greenie"" - a new one appears from the elevator shaft each month - but he quickly proves himself willing to run into the maze and tangle with the murderous ""grievers"" who patrol it. (They are - shades of Harry Potter - gigantic robotic spiders.) Thomass intuition that the glade is not a condition to be endured but rather a test to be conquered disrupts this little society pitting him against the bullying enforcer Gally (a more impressive Will Poulter in the easier role of being nasty rather than heroic).The premise seems both smart and intriguing but the film directed by Wes Ball bears many of the cruder markings of YA fiction. The dialogue is stuffed with bald exposition and zippy one-liners while the characters are types lifted from the pages of The Boys Own Annual including not only our hero Thomas but also a wise leader a smart kid and a chubby sidekick. These youths are surprisingly free of any sexual instincts and the lone female figure (the girl played by Kaya Scodelario whose appearance further disrupts the glade) is a token who barely participates in the action.And of course theres that surprising ending that sets us up nicely for the inevitable sequel.

"Maze Runner The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; maze-runner-the ) Maze Runner The (United States 2014) September 18 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Despite a strong opening and riveting first 45 minutes The Maze Runner devolves into one of the weakest post-apocalyptic Young Adult movies to reach theaters in recent years. The films inability to sustain the energy it starts with results in a disappointing experience. The muddled final act (with inconsistent and confusing ""revelations"") and open-ended conclusion add to the dissatisfaction. The Maze Runner gets off to a fantastic start and based exclusively on its first half looks to be a winner. Sadly the qualities that make the film so compelling early evaporate. As the sense of mystery dissipates so too does The Maze Runners ability to hold the viewers interest. The more we learn about the characters situation the less credible the story as a whole seems. There are some great ideas in The Maze Runner but the storyline patching them together is generic and frustrating. Worse the movie lurches to a halt rather than having a graceful ending forcing viewers to wait until the as-yet-unproduced sequel is available to learn the protagonists fates. As a result The Maze Runner fails to work as a stand-alone production. Maybe the addition of another chapter or two (there are three books in the series) will clarify the mass of incoherence that the screenplay exhibits in its final 30 minutes. The Maze Runner opens with the arrival of Thomas (Dylan OBrien) to a mysterious place known only as The Glade. This Lord of the Flies-inspired setting occupied by a group of teenage boys lies at the center of a massive maze. Escape from The Glade is thought to be impossible because the maze cannot be traversed safely at night. It changes daily and its corridors are patrolled after dark by the monstrous Grievers. The boys of The Glade have developed a primitive functioning society in which everyone performs their assigned tasks. The leader is Alby (Aml Ameen) who has been there the longest (three years). His lieutenants are the thoughtful Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and the pugnacious Gally (Will Poulter). Thomas arrives as all boys do with his memory wiped; he knows his name but remembers nothing else about his past. He also feels a powerful compulsion to become a maze runner - one of several boys whose job is to run through the maze during the day and map its convolutions. Circumstances in The Glade change dramatically with two events Alby is critically injured during a maze run and Teresa (Kayla Scodelario) arrives - the first girl to come to the Glade and according to a note she carries the last person ""ever"". The young mostly male cast is headed by Dylan OBrien a heartthrob-in-the-making with a built-in fan base as a result of his role in the TV series ""Teen Wolf."" British actor Will Poulter who played Eustace in The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and was more recently seen in Were the Millers understands what it takes to fashion a dislikeable character. Thomas Brodie-Sangster another Brit (and the only one allowed to keep his accent) may be familiar to Game of Thrones fans - he played Bran Starks companion Jojen Reed. Kayla Scodelario a U.K. TV regular since 2007 isnt given much to do and she certainly doesnt challenge Jennifer Lawrence for kick-ass girl dominance. The direction by first time feature filmmaker Wes Ball (whose background is in art and visual effects) is uneven. As one might expect the movie looks great. The set design is impressive and the special effects although limited are effectively integrated. Early in the proceedings Ball is able to generate tension. However in a later battle between boys and monsters shaky camera work fast pans and frequent cutting makes it virtually impossible to figure out whats happening. (To an extent this approach is a result of the PG-13 rating which doesnt allow the camera to linger when theres blood and death.) Having no familiarity with the source material (a 2007 novel by James Dashner) I cant say whether the movies narrative missteps of which there are many are the result of problems in the book or the byproduct of sloppy screenwriting or editing. The explanations for various mysteries are provided through unclear exposition and other things are nonsensical (such as one character showing up in a place where he shouldnt logically be). Fox has already greenlit the sequel so well be given an opportunity to see where the characters go next. Perhaps a strong second installment will redeem the bad taste left by the first one.

(Ben Rothstein) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 18 2014 400 PM Title The Maze Runner Film Info With Dylan OBrien Patricia Clarkson. Dystopian teen thriller about boys locked inside a strange man-made labyrinth. Director Wes Ball (153). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. ""The Maze Runner"" is so clearly an attempt to cash in on the craze for YA adaptations that you may feel your standards drop almost immediately. The movie sits somewhere between ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" in quality -- and rips them both off thematically with a little ""Lord of the Flies"" thrown in for extra literary cred. Fortunately though director Wes Ball and his outstanding young cast work unusually hard to counter the derivative feel. Dylan OBrien is Thomas a teen who wakes up to find himself in a strange land populated only by boys. Alby (Aml Ameen) is the leader who keeps order with steady Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and hot-headed Gally (Will Poulter). As Thomass bunkmate Chuck (Blake Cooper) explains they have been kidnapped and dropped in a lush glade with no instructions other than to survive. So they grow their own food and make their own laws until they figure out why theyre there. The primary rule is to respect the towering wall that surrounds them. Every morning the wall opens and the fastest boys -- the ""runners"" -- explore the stone maze beyond in hopes of finding an exit to the outside world. And every night they return before the wall closes and the mazes hideous monsters come out to hunt. Thomas is doubtful about this plan. It hasnt worked so far and answers none of his questions about the labyrinth or its unseen creators. But as he pushes limits luring the monsters and exploring their territory the dangers increase. There is no complex subtext here no engaging base on which to rest this simple plot. The mazes evil creator (Patricia Clarkson) exists solely to move the action forward. The groups only girl (Kaya Scodelario) who arrives toward the end is so underused she feels like a token gesture. From left Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) Thomas (Dylan OBrien) Teresa (Kaya Scoderlario) Minho (Ki Hong Lee) Frypan (Dexter Darden) and Winston (Alex Flores) in the Glade in ""The Maze Runner"" (Ben Rothstein) But the actors are exceptionally strong especially for unknowns starring in a young adult thriller. Each one finds a way to make his stock role stand out and feel real. Making his feature directorial debut Ball tries hard to keep us engaged with deft pacing and urgent action scenes that seem smartly tailored to the movies teen audience. No theres nothing new here. But sometimes its enough to be merely entertained rather than amazed. On a mobile device? Click here to watch video.

"The Maze Runner stumbles review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Maze Runner stumbles review While better than the weak Divergent series debut The Maze Runner cant unseat the superior Hunger Games franchise despite a solid young cast. The dialogue is dull and the story often ridiculous.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Sept. 18 2014The Maze RunnerStarring Dylan OBrien Will Poulter Kaya Scodelario Aml Ameen and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. Directed by Wes Ball. 113 minutes. Opening Friday Sept. 19 at major theatres. PGThe Maze Runner blazes into the young-adult box office arena this weekend armed with a solid young cast and a genuinely thrilling opening sequence.While better than the weak Divergent series debut when it comes to unseating the superior The Hunger Games franchise The Maze Runner is just an also-ran. Its burdened with banal dialogue and a laughably dumb endgame that squeezes the life out of its superior parts.Article Continued BelowEchoes of Lord of the Flies ricochet off the CGI-created metal maze at the heart of the story taken from James Dashners bestselling fantasy Y.A. trilogy. The maze rules the lives of a tight-knit community of teen boys all of whom have been abandoned there by unseen forces stripped of memories of their pasts on the way.Dylan OBrien and Kaya Scoderlario find themselves in the maze world in The Maze Runner based on the young adult series of books.  (Ben Rothstein / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)  The latest to be introduced into the agrarian society its inhabitants call The Glade is Thomas (Teen Wolfs Dylan OBrien). Hes been sent up in the same industrial lift that has been delivering boys to the maze world for the past few years along with enough supplies to keep the clan going.Leader Alby (Aml Ameen of Brit TV series The Bill) and lieutenant Newt (elfin Thomas Brodie-Sangster all grown up since Love Actually) help the confused newbie dubbed ""greenie"" by the guys find his feet. But suspicious Gally (Were the Millers Will Poulter) would rather let his fists do the talking.Each morning runners like fleet-footed Minho (Ki Hong Lee) race into the massive maze hoping to learn its secrets and earn escape. The solution eludes them as the behemoth changes its configuration each night with loud clangs and crashes propelled by what or whom the boys dont know. And like the ancient Labyrinth theres a Minotaur although in this case theyre a whole bunch of nasty steampunk scorpions called Grievers that deliver lethal stings from whipping tails.Thanks to the Grievers what the boys fear most is getting trapped in the maze as its massive door closes for the night. One wall of the maze is marked with the names of runners some with lines scratched through marking the night the thing swallowed them up. In terms of story the most compelling aspects of The Maze Runner happen outside the puzzle as the boys work out challenges and hierarchy while building their own society. They ponder their prior lives while dealing with the inevitability of their situation. While parents are only mentioned once its especially poignant.Inside the maze its more of a video game world loud and packed with heightened action pursuit and escape all of which grows repetitive quickly.Its inevitable that Thomas plagued by strange dreams that seem to point to some answers about their odd captivity will join the runners. But while his good looks will appeal to young fans he is the least-compelling of the cast. Wed rather watch Poulters bullying Gally or Ameens righteous Alby. Young Blake Cooper the most junior of the membership is quite good as chubby Chuck a chipper kid who harbours a sad soul.The all-male world gets a surprise with a new delivery to The Glade a girl named Teresa (a morose Kaya Scodelario) clutching a handwritten note that she is the last one. The arrival of the first female among the ranks isnt nearly as interesting as it could have been even if she and Thomas both have the feeling they know each other somehow.No matter Teresa is soon relegated to the role of nurse. ""Are all girls like that?"" one of the boys wonders when Teresa starts throwing things. Try saying that to Katniss Everdeen.Director Wes Ball who comes from the visual effects world to helm his first feature seems more enamoured with all things computer-generated wasting time in the maze that could be better spent keeping the story on track.Instead it rushes towards a dumb final conflict that seems to have come from another film and is tacked on as an explanation for all thats gone before.But Ball gets the most important part in. The closing scene points directly to the only possible exit from The Maze Runner at least from the point of view of those who have an interest in keeping the young-adult franchise machine churning out new product a sequel.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review Lost in the dystopian nightmare of The Maze Runner - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Lost in the dystopian nightmare of The Maze Runner Maze Runner Ben Rothstein / Twentieth Century Fox Dylan OBrien as Thomas in ""The Maze Runner."" Dylan OBrien as Thomas in ""The Maze Runner."" (Ben Rothstein / Twentieth Century Fox) Sheri Linden The Maze Runner is part Lord of the Flies part Hunger Games and part Survivor. Yawn Bucking the femme-centric trend in YA fantasy fare boys claim the dystopian spotlight in ""The Maze Runner.""The story based on the first novel in James Dashners four-book series finds the XY crowd with their work cut out for them Deprived of their memories the future-world teens are dropped into a mysterious social experiment thats a little bit ""Lord of the Flies"" a little bit ""Hunger Games"" and a little bit ""Survivor."" The franchise launcher directed by visual effects artist Wes Ball in his feature debut gets the vision and the grit of the source material but finally feels more like a long trailer than an involving movie. Screenwriters Noah Oppenheim Grant Pierce Myers and T.S. Nowlin guide the action toward an increasingly pointed setup for the next ""Maze"" film putting the main players in place and laying out the concepts in simplified but not always coherent fashion.Keeping with YA sci-fi tradition the movie is told from the point of view of a chosen one a kid whos ""not like the others"" and feels destined to challenge the groups fate. Hes Thomas played with bland Everyguy heroics by Dylan OBrien of the MTV series ""Teen Wolf."" Thomas is the latest boy -- and it turns out the last -- to find himself in a place called the Glade remembering nothing of his former life except his name after a terrifying ascent through darkness in a clanging metal box. Its a hellish rebirth canal and a powerful starting point for the story. Within the Glades colossal walls of their captivity the boys have built an orderly society collectivist and hierarchical. Led by Alby (Aml Ameen) theyre types more than individuals with Thomas Brodie-Sangster making the strongest impression as the simpatico second in command. Photos These days studios are increasingly looking to turn popular young adult books into movies. Do fans rush to theaters or stay at home and tightly clutch their books? Take a look at 25 examples. By Tracy Brown Noelene Clark Christy Khoshaba and Jevon Phillips. Theyve got their jobs their rituals and their rules. At the highest echelon are the brave athletic Runners the only ones allowed to exit the Glade when each morning the walls grind open (the sound design is potent) giving them access to the massive maze that surrounds their compound. For three years the boys have been trying to find a course of escape through the ever-shifting maze and its resident monsters. Not the most exciting of foes those are giant scuttling arachnids called Grievers part metal contraption and part slimy mollusk flesh.Low-key but not given to false modesty Thomas is determined to solve the puzzle. He is soon breaking the rules and rising to the top of the pack -- not without resistance of course The obligatory antagonist (capably played by Will Poulter whose character has been watered down from the book) distrusts him and his suspicions deepen with the testosterone-testing arrival of a girl (Kaya Scodelario) who seems to know Thomas. Maze Runner Ben Rothstein / 20th Century Fox Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and the Gladers look deep into the maze in ""The Maze Runner."" Thomas (Dylan OBrien) and the Gladers look deep into the maze in ""The Maze Runner."" (Ben Rothstein / 20th Century Fox) Ball tends to slice and dice action sequences in a way that drains them of energy and his attempts to churn up emotion fall disconcertingly flat. But he does stage a couple of effective adrenaline-pumping chases through the mazes industrial wasteland. Notwithstanding the assumed tech capabilities of the Glades unseen string-pullers ""The Maze Runner"" puts a refreshingly primitive slant on dystopia. Marc Fisichellas production design is a vivid earthy rendering of Dashners imagined world with the wide-screen cinematography of Enrique Chediak emphasizing the boys place in the terrible scheme of things. Also emphasizing that is a brief appearance by Patricia Clarkson -- further proof along with turns by Kate Winslet in ""Divergent"" and Jodie Foster in ""Elysium"" that no post-apocalyptic nightmare is complete without an icy blond bureaucrat.calendarlatimes.com------------The Maze RunnerMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic elements intense sequences of violence and action disturbing imagesRunning time 1 hour 54 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Action (Movie Genre) Kate Winslet Kaya Scodelario Jodie Foster Maze Runner director talks Dylan OBrien James Dashner real grime Maze Runner may outrace Tombstones This Is Where I Leave You The Maze Runner Can it solve the YA puzzle?

Grade B The premise of ""The Maze Runner"" has been compared to ""Lord of the Flies meets Lost"" but its more innocent and refreshing than that. Much of it resembles a wilderness-family survival story except that it takes place beside the concrete walls of a giant maze in a clearing called the Glade filled with boys whose memories are wiped clean. The movies hero Thomas (Dylan OBrien) arrives in the Glade via a rattling and disorienting elevator ride. The way the Glades leaders explain their little colony its an idealized boys-only kibbutz Each member finds the task hes suited for and agrees to work for the common good. Thomas immediately senses something off. Too many Gladers including his instant nemesis Gally (Will Poulter) arent curious about the people who sent them there. Thomas reckons that the answer lies in the Maze along with the route home (wherever that may be). He decides to enter it even before anyone designates him a Maze Runner and he soon becomes a hero for his courageous defeat of a fearsome Griever - the gross hybrid of a spidery insect a homicidal robot and an ""Alien""-like alien. As young-adult movie fantasies go ""The Maze Runner"" is far snappier and more original than the box-office hit ""Divergent"" and miles beyond misfires like ""The Mortal Instruments."" If you havent read the book and its two sequels and one prequel (I flipped through the first one after watching the film) you can still enjoy this Spartan spectacle as a throwback to the kind of kids Saturday action matinees that riffed off Jules Verne and H.G. Wells. It contains sure-fire boys-adventure sights like a pack of kids battling biomechanical monsters with makeshift spears. I do wish director Wes Ball hadnt relied so heavily on creepy amped-up sounds. I also wish hed found a way to bring the handmade green-brown ambiance of his Glade scenes inside the Maze whose shifting walls resemble the moving parts of a video game. Its too bad he felt that fidelity to the source precluded him from expanding the role of Thomas female counterpart until late in the game. Ball is deft though at evoking claustrophobia of every kind whether in the open-air prison of the Glade or the actual tight spaces of the Maze. And he elicits a hair-trigger performance from OBrien who brings urgency empathy and rippling reflexes to a boy who finds his true identity as an unconventional hero. When it comes to the status quo hes a doubting Thomas but when it comes to blazing trails hes a grown-up Tom Terrific.

Photo Ben Rothstein/AP MOVIE REVIEW The Maze Runner Wheezy. Running time 113 minutes. Rated PG-13 (language scary situations). At the Empire 34th St. others. ""The Maze Runner"" isnt based on a video game but you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise. In it our hero must lead his comrades through a dingy gray concrete maze while dodging cyborg monsters and it all looks like every gaming trailer youve ever seen. No this is -- stop me if youve heard this one before -- an adaptation of the first book in a post-apocalyptic sci-fi young-adult trilogy. This time its James Dashners novel about a group of teenage boys mysteriously imprisoned in a wooded area surrounded by a constantly shifting labyrinth. The films first two minutes are pretty gripping A young man named Thomas (Dylan OBrien ""Teen Wolf"") comes to gasping and retching in a coffin-size elevator being slowly raised to . . . somewhere. He cant remember who he is or where he came from. When it opens he is surrounded by a group of other boys chuckling at his terror. He learns hes in what they call ""the Glade"" and that every other boy there has arrived in the same fashion over the past three years. Theyre walled in by an enormous maze and a few agile young men called runners go into it during the day trying to map it out. The maze entrance slams shut every night when creatures they call ""grievers"" patrol it. No one can remember their past or figure out how to get out. In its early sections this adds up to an enjoyably ""Lord of the Flies"" vibe with a smidgen of ""Lost."" There are good guys like ace runner Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and peacemaker Alby (Aml Ameen) and friendly Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster of ""Game of Thrones""). And there are ominous guys like Gally (Will Poulter) who doesnt take kindly to rule-breaking and seems a little too comfortable with life in the Glade. Too soon though director Wes Ball has us in overly familiar territory. ""Youre different from the others"" Alby tells Thomas. ""Youre curious."" Thomas breaks the rules and stays with Minho in the maze overnight when ""nobody ever survives a night in the maze."" (But guess what?) For my money the most entertaining moment is when a young woman (Kaya Scodelario) gets dropped into this boys club. ""Girls are awesome"" shouts little Chuck (Blake Cooper) as the freaked-out Teresa flings produce at their heads from the top of a tree. Ultimately though she doesnt do anything other than tag along with the boys for the big revelation at the end which is completely preposterous and left me wondering if this multi-hyphenate genre may have finally run its course.

And ""The Maze Runner"" has all that. But it also has that awesome titular labyrinth. And a sort of ""Lord of the Flies"" feel as its stranded-in-the-woods characters build a boys-only camp of tough rules and sharp sticks. Oh and it has spiders. Giant slavering robo-spiders. And thats enough to make it far more entertaining than the other YA sci-fi weve seen this year including ""Divergent"" and ""The Giver"" -- although whether it can sustain that appeal over two sequels (yes like everything else these days its a trilogy) remains to be seen. The movie stars Springfield Townships Dylan OBrien as Thomas the latest boy to wake up -- confused and missing his memory -- in a wooded place known as the Glade. For three years now a new boy has been dropped off once a month. The unseen authorities need to keep replenishing the population you see because of the maze which surrounds the boys -- and is stocked with those lethal android arachnids. OBrien isnt a particularly memorable actor but then theres not much to Thomas; only slightly more colorful is the perpetually ticked-off Gally mostly because Will Poulter has the best eyebrows in young Hollywood. (Really theyre like a couple of dancing caterpillars.) But thats OK because all thats called for the actors here is to run and scream and run some more as theyre chased down those twisting corridors by the eight-legged freaks. Director Wes Ball doesnt have much experience with actors but for once thats a plus; his background is in animation and art direction and the design of the maze (Brutalist slabs of concrete and steel) and the attacks by the spiders (""Predator""-like clicks and then stabbing violence) make the movie gruesomely watchable. Actually a warning here; although ""The Hunger Games"" pushed the PG-13 envelope pretty far in terms of violence ""The Maze Runner"" nudges it even further. This probably isnt a film for the 10-and-under crowd although in some ways the movie is rather innocent -- particularly when a female teen Kaya Scodelario is suddenly dropped off. I mean really you leave a pretty teenage girl in the midst of a gang of teenage boys who havent seen a female in three years. And not one even makes a pass? Let alone a stupid dirty joke? Whatever else is being done to these kids clearly somethings being put in their water too. But what is being done to them? Well eventually we do get some backstory. I dont know that its very satisfactory either. Some of it is simply silly (the supposed villains operate under the acronym W.I.C.K.E.D.) and not all of it makes perfect sense. But it does leave you wanting to see the next installment. And thats one special effect that very few YA movies ever pull off. Ratings note The film contains violence and underage drinking.. The Maze Runner (PG-13) Fox (113 min.) Directed by Wes Ball. With Dylan OBrien Kaya Scodelario Will Poulter Patricia Clarkson.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan September 18 2014 Like the book that inspired it -- the first of a trilogy that includes ""The Scorch Trials"" and ""The Death Cure"" -- ""The Maze Runner"" movie is one heck of a cliffhanger. If the theater had been selling tickets to the next installment of the dystopian thriller (already greenlighted by 20th Century Fox although no release date has been set) I would have bought one before I left the lobby. Thats about the worst thing I can say about the film Its not quite a full meal. But if the soup course is as satisfying as the salad Ill gladly wait a year for the next serving. As incomplete as the narrative is ""The Maze Runner"" delivers on almost every other level. Directed by Wes Ball a creator of animated shorts and visual effects making his feature debut the adaptation of James Dashers novel is visually stylish suspenseful and original. Ball has described the film as ""Lord of the Flies"" meets ""Lost"" -- a somewhat grandiose-sounding pedigree that turns out to be surprisingly apt. ""The Maze Runner"" is set inside a bucolic compound surrounded by a massive wall. Known as the Glade this village of thatched huts and hammocks appears to be a prison of sorts inhabited by a gaggle of apparently amnesiac adolescent boys -- Gladers -- who have over the course of their mysterious three-year incarceration developed a highly regimented tribal social structure featuring assigned jobs. The most elite of these is the job of Runner. As it turns out the wall conceals a maze the door to which opens every day between sunrise and sunset. During daylight hours Runners -- and no one else -- are tasked with exploring the mazes contours mapping them while looking for an exit. Its a job made more complicated by the fact that the maze changes configuration while they sleep and more dangerous by the fact that its corridors are patrolled by monstrous spiderlike sentries called Grievers. Part machine and part muscle Grievers will kill anyone who gets stuck inside the maze after dark. Into this dead-end scenario lands a boy named Thomas (Dylan OBrien). Hes the latest inmate to arrive via the subterranean freight elevator that ascends once a month into the middle of the Glade carrying one more kid who cant remember anything except his name along with another 30 days worth of supplies. But something is different about Thomas as several of the other boys note. This observation in and of itself makes Thomas sound exactly like the hero of every other teenage drama. But Thomas isnt especially fast smart strong talented or brave. In fact hes just as scared as everyone else as he tells us. Yet hes also so willing to question the status quo that three days after his arrival Thomas defies the Gladers rules and enters the maze where he not only survives a night inside but also comes out having killed a Griever. The sequences inside the maze are viscerally claustrophobic yet Ball evokes a visual mood thats closer to the interior of a cathedral. The filmmaker has a knack for chills and thrills ratcheting up the stakes and excitement every time Thomas -- who is quickly recruited as a Runner after he discovers a previously unknown portal -- steps inside the maze. But the movie is about more than a puzzle or the Gladers search for answers to the questions of who put them there and why. Its a parable about the power of curiosity. As the saying goes curiosity may kill the cat but without it how are you going to kick down the door onto the next of your nine lives? ""The Maze Runner"" defies expectations on several levels not the least of which is its avoidance of the now seemingly requisite teen-romance subplot. Although a girl (Kaya Scodelario) shows up in the Glade soon after Thomas does there is refreshingly no canoodling merely an understandable perplexity among her male peers who have been living so long in their enforced man cave that theyve forgotten what anything else feels like. ""Are all girls like this?"" asks one of the youngest boys (Blake Cooper) with a tone of reverence and awe as the new prisoner showers her cohort with a barrage of rocks mere minutes after climbing out of the elevator. So do they get out? That would be telling. And given the torque of the twisty ending it isnt a yes-or-no question either. Sure ""The Maze Runner"" unravels a few mysteries but it spins even more. Thomas as it happens isnt the only one dying of curiosity here. As the closing credits roll you likely will be too.    PG-13. At area theaters.

Photo Credit AP / Ben Rothstein advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A teenage boy wakes up with no memory of how he became trapped in a giant maze. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE Boys get their own ""Hunger Games"" in this entertaining teen-dystopia entry. CAST Dylan OBrien Will Poulter Kaya Scodelario Patricia Clarkson LENGTH 153 The strangest thing about science fiction a genre famous for catering to the fantasies of daydreaming boys has been its recent popularity among girls. In both book and movie form ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" have made billions selling their futuristic heroines to female audiences while recent boy-oriented movies like ""Enders Game"" and ""The Giver"" have flopped. Enter ""The Maze Runner"" Wes Balls adaptation of James Dashners 2009 best-seller. Its hero is Thomas (Dylan OBrien MTVs ""Teen Wolf"") who wakes up in a bucolic meadow called the Glade but has no memory of how he got there. His fellow Gladers -- all male all equally clueless -- explain that hope for escape is slim Surrounding them is a towering concrete maze patrolled by spider-like robots called Grievers. Boys known as runners led by Minho (Ki Hong Lee) map the maze each day but the concrete walls shift each night.

""The Maze Runner"" is chock-full of male bonding homemade weapons robot battles even a tree fort -- just about everything but snails and puppy-dogs tails. Though it sometimes feels calculated and mechanical its also solid well crafted and entertaining. The maze itself is supercool an endlessly pivoting puzzle that begs to be explored and its inhabited by a remarkably strong cast. Among the standouts are Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt a friendly kid with owlish eyes and a terrific Will Poulter (""Were the Millers"") as Gally a boy hardened too soon into manhood. Kaya Scodelaria as the Glades most surprising newcomer Teresa barely registers but may get more to work with in the future. (Patricia Clarkson in a small role lets us know a sequel is coming.) ""The Maze Runner"" occasionally ventures into ""Lord of the Flies"" territory depicting violence that feels rougher both physically and emotionally than the usual PG-13 fare. Frankly that also may appeal to the movies target audience. ""The Maze Runner"" is the first dystopian teen movie in a while that offers boys a room of their own.

Those who hunger for more could do worse than ""The Maze Runner.""  |  out of 4 stars By Cynthia Dickison Star Tribune September 18 2014 -- 309pm 20th Century Fox Minho (Ki Hong Lee) and Thomas (Dylan OBrien) study a model of the maze for clues to escape in ""The Maze Runner."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Is there room at the multiplex for yet another entry in the young adult/dystopia/survival genre? Those who hunger for more could do worse than ""The Maze Runner"" based on the first book in James Dashners trilogy. Were plunged right into the action along with Thomas (the appealing Dylan OBrien) who wakes up sans memory in a roaring freight elevator. It deposits him in the Glade a seemingly bucolic settlement populated by boys who have arrived there in the same manner and have turned the place into a melding of Outward Bound and ""Lord of the Flies"" with echoes of ""Lost."" Hes quickly indoctrinated by a trio of helpful mates spiritual leader Alby (Aml Ameen) cheeky Brit Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster the lovesick kid from ""Love Actually"") and the cherubic Chuck (Blake Cooper channeling a young Jonah Hill). The upshot Hell soon remember his name but nothing else; a new boy plus supplies arrives every month; and above all he mustnt go into the maze. This labyrinth is a monolithic edifice that encloses the little encampment like a nightmare version of the skyscrapers around Central Park. Every morning it opens up allowing specially designated ""runners"" to explore and map its contours looking for a way out -- but those contours change daily. And woe to the runner who is trapped overnight; none has ever survived an attack by the Grievers the giant half spider/half erector sets that emerge after dark. Their sting revives memory but also induces madness and death. Its soon obvious to all that Thomas is different. Hes curious brave and outspoken about what actions the group should take. This earns him the enmity of the Gladers self-appointed leader Gally (Will Poulter) who we know is mean because of his eyebrows. And sure enough he tries to turn the rest of the boys against Thomas even after the new kid manages to kill one of the Grievers opening up new possibilities for escape. More trouble for Thomas arrives in the form of Teresa (Kaya Scoledario) the first girl sent to the Glade. She seems to know him and they discover they have the same shared visions of a mysterious laboratory. This cements in Gallys mind -- and maybe even Thomas -- that he is the cause of all the Gladers newfound troubles. THE MAZE RUNNER  out of 4 stars Rated PG-13 thematic elements and intense sequences of sci-fi. ""The Maze Runner"" offers nothing particularly innovative and some characters particularly Gally and Teresa (who has little to do other than open her eyes wide and ask ""What does it mean?"") border on caricature. But the setting is ominously beautiful and the themes of leadership and loyalty are deftly mined. No film of the second book ""The Scorch Trials"" has been announced; but as Patricia Clarkson leader of a Dharma Initiative-like corporation called W.C.K.D. (say it out loud) declares in the closing minutes its time for ""Phase Two.""

Wes Balls film version of the popular young-adult novel by James Dashner never makes much sense. Perhaps it would make more if you have read the book but until they start handing out free copies before the movie starts that cannot be a requirement.Thomas (Dylan OBrien) is jolted awake inside a freight elevator which delivers him to the Glade a big field where other boys greet him. He has no idea where he is or why he is there -- and at this point hes not even Thomas; he cant remember his name. That memory will come back in a couple of days the others tell Thomas but thats the only one.Alby (Ami Ameen) the leader of the group lays out the situation Theyve been there three years. Theyre actually at the center of a huge maze; presumably if they could work out the path it would lead to their freedom. Trouble is the maze changes shape every night.RELATED azcentral.coms newest movie reviewsStill every day the Runners the fastest and strongest of the boys run through it trying to map its paths. They have to do their work during the day because at night the Grievers giant scorpion-looking monster-machine hybrids roam around the maze (giant doors shut every night to protect the Glade from them). No one who has ever spent the night inside the maze has lived to tell the story.Every boy has his place his job a role; order is what makes the whole thing work. But no one knows why theyre there. Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) along with Alby befriends Thomas but Gally (Will Poulter) is suspicious of him. With good reason maybe. Thomas is not content to just go along with the order of things. He wants to find out why theyre there and escape. Now.Kaya Scodelario and Dylan OBrien in a scene from ""The Maze Runner."" (Photo 20th Century Fox)Suspicions are further aroused when a Runner stung by a Griever attacks Thomas and says its ""all your fault.""All very mysterious and vaguely intriguing because we are operating under the impression that all will be explained. When Thomas going to the aid of Alby manages to kill a Griever hes not hailed as a hero by everyone. Instead Gally wants him punished.So a classic power struggle is building. Then one day the elevator arrives and a girl is inside unconscious with a note that says she is the ""last one ever."" When the girl Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) awakens she seems to recognize Thomas though neither of them is sure how.RELATED 52 Fall films to seeIts all leading to a showdown between Thomas and Gally of course and an escape attempt. And we do eventually find out who put everyone in the Glade and why. Sort of. Its probably not a spoiler to say that the answer is ""Huh?""Like far too much of the rest of the movie the motives rattled off in quick fashion are nearly incomprehensible. The explanations feel crammed in as if they might take too much screen time away from the attractive cast (remember the target audience here).The look of the film is impressive enough but the performances are merely OK. The same goes for the story. Young-adult tales of a dystopian future are increasingly common. Although OBrien has the requisite heartthrob looks its not enough to make ""The Maze Runner"" stand out in a crowded field. Naturally in the end its all a setup for another installment. Maybe the next one will make more sense.Review The Maze Runner 2 starsDirector Wes Ball.Cast Dylan OBrien Kaya Scodelario Will Poulter.Rating PG-13 for thematic elements and intense sequence of sci-fi violence and action including some disturbing images.AZCENTRALThe Maze Runner (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

You find yourself in an elevator hurtling upward fast until it hits the top and you are disgorged into a huge field bordered with high prison-like walls. You remember nothing not even your name; the couple dozen other boys call you Greenie. They are lifers in this Glade with virtually no hope of escape and they tell you their three rules 1. Do your part. 2. Never harm another Glader. 3. Never go beyond the walls. But rules are made to be broken especially by the young heroes of YA adventures like The Maze Runner James Dashners trilogy of novels. In the mode of The Hunger Games and Divergent Dashner puts teens of the future through harrowing tests of stamina usually outdoors. Its a sadistic teachers version of P.E. -- if that stood for Punishment and Exhaustion -- or maybe Fatal Recess. One imagines a generation of readers getting excuse slips from gym class to read these books and grateful for the ordeal theyre missing to slip into a dystopian time warp. (READ Corliss on the first and second films of The Hunger Games) In the surprisingly sharp movie version of The Maze Runner the schoolyard is that penitentiary courtyard where the prisoners have created their own primitive society they raise crops stand guard against the monstrous Grievers outside and as boys will flirt with social chaos by getting into occasional fights. (Dashner has read The Lord of the Flies.) Most Gladers dwell in the grave pessimism of underage Prisoners of War. They have succumbed to the basic precept of POW inertia that fear breeds caution. There is no rosy future in the Glades grim nowness; it is like Jean-Paul Sartres No Exit-tentialism but more crowded and with the musk of bottled-up testosterone. The Greenie in the Glade Thomas (Dylan OBrien of MTVs Teen Wolf) is just the tonic the place needs. Your standard YA rebel without a clue he lacks both knowledge and fear of the terrors without. Hes the one raw recruit who no sooner hears someone say ""No one survives a night in Maze"" than he dreams of threading through it or losing himself in it. He will enter the Maze with senior Glader Alby (Aml Ameen) to battle the Grievers -- mechanical creatures with sticky footprints a sea lions mournful roar and the Alien teeth mandatory in sci-fi horror movies -- and give his dour fellows exactly what their leader Gally (Will Poulter the ""son"" in Were the Milers) has warned them against the secret ingredient of hope. (READ TIMEs tribute to Alien monster-make H.R. Giger) The Maze Runner movie comes from feature-film novices -- director Wes Ball and screenwriters Noah Oppenheim Grant Pierce Myers and T.S. Nowlin -- working on a 34-million budget modest for a YA film with franchise ambitions. Switching the sex of the Hunger Games and Divergent protagonists to young male the film mines the summer-camp (or prison-camp) camaraderie and rivalry of teen boys. So obsessed are the lads with their miserable confinement that when pretty Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) pops put of the elevator an hour into the film they dont line up for a kiss or some rougher affection. Thomas and his classmates might also be the Allied prisoners in The Great Escape. Escape they must or this would be one bleak trilogy into a Maze of New Brutalist architecture and mystic combinations to mysterious chambers. It all leads up to what should be the movies climax but is instead a long teaser for a sequel still in the planning stage -- as if the projectionist had switched reels at precisely the wrong moment. Wed almost rather be back in the Glade where boys try to be men and Hope is getting out of Detention. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Photo Ben Rothstein HONS / Associated Press Review Maze Runner heads for sci-fi greatness gets lost 1 / 3 Back to Gallery As far as young-adult-novel dystopian societies go the boys in ""The Maze Runner"" have it pretty good. Think ""Lord of the Flies"" without all the jerks. They live as captives inside a quarry-like landscape with social order livestock and even a distillery for underage drinking. Monsters making scary noises at night seem safely on the other side of the wall. And someone just dropped a girl in the meadow The science fiction thriller based on James Dashners 2007 book is at its best in the setup providing an engaging adolescent fantasy mixed with a dash of intrigue and menace. As the mystery unfolds the film starts to collapse under the weight of its unanswered questions -- which crescendo with an ending that borders on infuriating. Director Wes Ball and three screenwriters set a nice early tone quickly establishing the society and its fragile sanctuary. Dylan OBrien (TVs ""Teen Wolf"") is Thomas who is introduced on a Disneyland ride of an elevator ending in the idyllic prison pit known as the Glade. This home is filled with teen boys and surrounded by high rock walls with one opening; the entrance to a mysterious labyrinth filled with creatures called Grievers. Although most among the Gladers are content to take their time Thomas wants to become a ""runner"" and aggressively seek freedom. Hes hailed as a hero by some a dangerous newcomer by others. And then that girl shows up ... The story like the maze itself is initially an efficient piece of machinery. The society is quickly established clues are doled out and the conflict results in some effective early action scenes. Also helpful is a cast of likable (and refreshingly diverse) actors most notably Aml Ameen and Ki Hong Lee as the groups leader and a gutsy runner who has explored the maze. But time is not a friend to the Gladers or ""The Maze Runner."" The writers seem to have been reared in the ""Lost"" school of storytelling happy to pile on three more questions for every answer. The film embraces that annoying story cheat where characters who know key information are always getting distracted or snatched away just as theyre about to reveal an important truth. As time goes by the dialogue seems to get more overwrought (""He belongs to the maze now..."") and the musical score becomes overbearing. And while the maze itself is convincing too many action scenes are filmed with confusing quick cuts dim visuals and second-rate CGI. Young fans of the book will probably be more forgiving about the ending an over-the-top information dump that alternates laughable moments with sheer lunacy. All of the above ends with a cliffhanger of course. If they dont make the second ""The Maze Runner"" -- suggested title ""Maze Runner 2 Lord of the Hunger Games"" -- everyone who watched the first one should get their money back. That probably wont be necessary. These books have a lot of fans and a decent effort with this first movie will probably create a few more. Second-to-final thought For a movie aimed at tweens the body count is quite high in the film. Ball finds creative ways to keep the mostly horrific deaths offscreen. Final thought While the acting is solid throughout the reaction to a girl who has been sent to the Glade is completely unrealistic. The boys some who have been living in an all-male society for three years react as if theyve been sent a sack of potatoes. Laws of puberty ensure that at least one would have immediately made flatulence noises with his armpit in an attempt to impress her ... Peter Hartlaub is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1112 a.m. EDT September 19 2014Kaya Scodelario left Dylan OBrien Aml Ameen and Jacob Latimore in ""The Maze Runner."" The sci-fi mystery opens Sept. 19.(Photo Ben Rothstein 20th Century Fox)The Maze Runner will have you going in circles.Sometimes its a hectic action adventure other times it feels like an updated version of Lord of the Flies. Ultimately its yet another tale of a teen dystopia. ( out of four; rated PG-13; opening Friday).In any of the above scenarios it leaves questions unanswered. A sci-fi thriller set in a vaguely post-apocalyptic future must create a fully drawn universe to thoroughly captivate the viewer. But Maze Runner feels only partially formed.USA TODAYThis Is Where I Leave You will leave your memory fastBecause its based on James Dashners 2009 young adult fantasy novel viewers will expect a detailed world. Maze Runner adds nothing special to the surfeit of dystopian thrillers based on young adult books of late -- The Hunger Games Divergent The Giver -- though it has an affable cast and some striking visuals.About three-fourths of the movie is set on a large grassy meadow known as The Glade which houses a civilization of stranded adolescent boys. Its a fairly bucolic setting that superficially resembles summer camp rather than the usual bombed-out wasteland of post-apocalyptic movies. But their lush confines are hemmed in by huge imposing walls that lead to an impenetrable labyrinth of peril.The boys have fashioned a well-ordered sense of community living in simple lean-tos setting boundaries and imposing rules. Theyve had to create a structured society since they must routinely face creepy challenges. Literally. Giant metallic creepy crawlers known as ""grievers"" live in the maze and ""sting"" those who try to explore beyond the boundaries of the glade. Whatever these gargantuan spiders contain its deadly.USA TODAYMore like a trudge Walk at least talks the talkThe guys are delivered regular rations. Only a few known as ""runners"" can venture beyond the towering walls as per the groups decision to seek an escape route. But those few take their lives in their hands risking death by metallic creeper or fatal crushing by the mazes constantly changing sliding walls.Alby (Aml Ameen) is the leader of the pack the first boy plopped into this verdant prison. No one knows why theyre confined there nor do they have any recollection of life before this meadow.None of this makes much sense unless the viewer assumes their brains were experimented on or tampered with. Yet the boys still have fairly normal reactions impulses and vocabulary. They just seem to have endured a memory wipe.Its a slow-paced yarn. Believability is dodgy especially since the boys are none the worse for wear. They look fit and remarkably well-coiffed. This is especially the case for Minho (Ki Hong Lee) a group leader whose gravity-defying stylish do is as impressive as his derring-do. . Early on Thomas (Dylan OBrien) is transported from the ground via a cage-like elevator contraption to the boys ordered world and things begin to shift. At least thats what his bullying nemesis Gally (Will Poulter) claims as their sequestered existence unravels.Thomas courage fueled by unquenchable curiosity and a refusal to follow rules may offer a remote possibility of escape.Director Wes Ball focuses more on the films visual effects than on the psyches and motivations of the characters. Suspense suffers because of it.If historians in future generations look at current films as emblematic of our culture theyll deduce we lived in a civilization with a morbid fear of the apocalypse.That may well be but Hollywood suffers more from a rabid desire to cannibalize copy and repeat. The films conclusion seems frenetic rushing headlong into a closing scene which may be the most blatant set-up for a sequel of any movie this year. The Maze Runner should have focused more on effectively establishing its premise instead of being diverted by the storys franchise potential. 30 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1uekyC3",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/09/18/the-maze-runner-review/15476845/,200,themazerunner23,themazerunner,usatoday

You experience the crazy story in real time wondering where its going every step of the way the mind uncluttered by issues of adaptation or fidelity or ""world-building"" or whatever. Thats probably not an option for the films intended audience of course who have all presumably read the first installment in James Dashners popular young adult series and know where its all headed. Speaking for myself I was quite riveted. Most of our youthful dystopias these days share common elements (some probably inspired by the challenges of high school). There are the controlled communities often led by benevolent leaders who turn out to be not so benevolent. Theres the forced regimentation and the selection of elites. And our outlier heroes who almost always discover that they have ""special"" powers usually find themselves fighting against the complacency of those around them. This tends to stack the decks a bit At least going by the movie versions of these stories we spend a lot of time waiting for everybody to realize that all is not well with their societies. But The Maze Runner dispenses with that reveal in its opening frames. Our hero Thomas (Dylan OBrien) wakes up to find himself in a small community of young men living in a forced bucolic enclosure and nobody seems to be under the impression that the situation is anything but fucked. Everybodys mind has been wiped clean and they remember nothing but their names. (""Its the one thing they let us keep."") Every month their community the Glade gets a new member deposited via a mysterious elevator which also delivers supplies. The Glade is surrounded by a giant impenetrable ever-shifting maze that opens up daily and closes at night. Some members of this community -- the fastest ones -- explore the maze trying to find a way out; they just have to remember to get back before the mazes gates close otherwise they will be trapped inside and eaten by mysterious creatures called Grievers. If other YA movies are inspired by high school this one seems to be inspired by prison.That is a ridiculous setup but its also a fascinating one Its all so artificial and elaborate that you not only wonder what its all for you also wonder what sort of sick mind would even bother to create something like this. The Maze Runner wisely saves the big stuff for the end so that for most of the movie the immediacy of these kids situation takes precedence. Can they discover more of the maze? What does a Griever actually look like? Why does there seem to be something different about Thomas? Why does one of the other boys seem to recognize him just before going crazy? And whos the girl (Kaya Scodelario) who just got deposited via the elevator? OBrien with his huge eyes and his cheekbones that could cut glass conveys Thomass befuddled desperation well; he looks great when hes totally freaked out. Thats a real talent for a young actor since most of them are usually too busy acting stoic hoping to land the next superhero gig. Indeed the whole cast does an excellent job relaying the urgency of the story. These characters have pretty much no backstory; theyre defined almost exclusively by their fears. And so they all cower and hover and cluster always watchful never complacent. Their energy helps the film through some of its rough patches. The action scenes for example are shot and cut with very little coherence but were still invested in the characters so relatively little harm is done. And by the end were so wound up that we may not even notice how clunky some of the bigger reveals of the film are handled. Even so The Maze Runner only answers some of the questions it so marvelously sets up. And while I probably now know too much about the story for it to work a similar magic next time I find myself genuinely anticipating the next one.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A young man (Teen Wolfs Dylan OBrien) awakes in the throes of panic rising through the darkness in a small metal box with no memory of how he got there or even who he is. His name is Thomas though that little nugget of information wont come back to him for another day or so after hes had some time to adjust to his new circumstances. The Maze Runner opens with this frightening entry wasting no time on prologue or prelude. Within minutes the situation is clear Thomas is the newest arrival to The Glade a grassy outpost populated exclusively by teenage boys all ripped unceremoniously from lives they cant remember. Surrounding their new home is an enormous shifting labyrinth; each morning ""runners"" brave its narrow passageways mapping its architecture and searching for a way out. Those who fail to return before nightfall when the entrance to the maze closes are never seen or heard from again.The Maze Runner draws its familiar Twilight Zone premise from the first book in James Dashners teen-lit series. But dont hold that against it As YA adaptations go its surprisingly brisk tough and unsentimental sharing more in common with the old British television series The Prisoner than with say The Hunger Games. Theres no tortured love triangle here or even a love interest really. In fact the drama revolves entirely around how the characters approach their unique predicament. Thomas the shock to this mysterious system is the typical embodiment of headstrong individualism; he wants to make an escape plan not accept his role in the groups makeshift society. His philosophy naturally clashes with that of the films nominal antagonist Gally (Will Poulter from Were The Millers) whos been at the Glade longer than any of the others and is a real stickler for the survival rules he helped establish. The storys real villains of course are the unseen engineers of this bizarre deathtrap as well as their enforcers a race of H.R. Giger-ish monsters that patrol the maze. The beasts only attack under cover of darkness which is convenient for the special-effects team. Making his feature directorial debut industry veteran Wes Ball--who has a slew of art department and special effects credits to his name--capably handles both the CGI-abetted action and his ensemble of teen stars including Thomas Brodie-Sangster (Game Of Thrones) and Kaya Scodelario (playing the first girl introduced into this testosterone-heavy habitat). His characters denied backstories or more than a single primal goal arent exactly multidimensional. But there are stray moments of poignancy One boy gives away a trinket from his parents reasoning that its meaningless without any memories of the people who gave it to him and Gally becomes something of a tragic figure staving off hysteria by clinging to the hierarchies of his sad little community. Anyway the stripped-bare quality of the storytelling is refreshing. The Maze Runner bucks the conventions of its genre by functioning as a pure cliffhanger machine fueled by mystery instead of melodrama.Eventually though that mystery must be solved and the films final minutes are a little deflating both for the expository answers they provide and for their mercenary function as sequel setup. Its here that The Maze Runner most betrays its airport-fiction roots revealing itself as a blatantly inconclusive entry in a prospective franchise. Just as the characters manage to navigate the murkily metaphoric layout of the labyrinth only to discover something just as treacherous on the other side viewers not already invested in Dashners grand design may feel underwhelmed by the ""ending."" In other words if youre going to treat your audience like a rat in a maze its best to offer a tastier reward than the promise of more maze to come.

"Review The Maze Runner perks up tired YA action formula - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview The Maze Runner perks up tired YA action formulaBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 09/17/2014 120914 PM PDTUpdated 09/18/2014 124844 PM PDTI was having problems with ""The Maze Runner"" before I even bothered to see it.Movies about dystopian post-apocalyptic worlds being saved by heroic and terribly good-looking young people -- adapted from among the mountain of young adult novels that are seemingly required reading for kids age 10 and up -- are in danger of becoming as stale as a holiday fruitcake in July.Then I watched ""The Maze Runner"" and I couldnt help getting hooked by the combination of fine acting intriguing premise and riveting scenery -- even if the story at times was a bit too easy.Yes its painfully obvious the film based on James Dashners popular fantasy novels borrows from ""Lord of the Flies"" ... and ""The Terminator"" ... and maybe even ""Alien"" and any film in which humans are unwittingly used in supersized experiments.I didnt care. ""The Maze Runner"" managed to grab my attention because it seemed plausible (until things got shaky at the end). It succeeds by taking a new approach to the otherwise tiresome YA action blockbuster. The story starts with Thomas (Dylan OBrien of ""Teen Wolf"") waking up on a speeding reverse elevator from hell shooting toward the surface where 30-40 ragged young men are trapped in the Glade -- a small forest surrounded by the giant walls of a gargantuan maze. Thomas -- like everyone else there -- initially has no memory of who he is or where he came from.Advertisement Thomas quickly inserts himself into the group led by Alby (Aml Ameen). The characters are familiar -- a suspicious enforcer/bad guy Gally (Will Poulter); a younger affable chubby kid Chuck (Blake Cooper); a potential heroic sidekick Minho (Ki Hong Lee); and eventually the mysterious girl Teresa who -- surprise -- is tough as nails with a heart of gold (Kaya Scodelario who is fairly magnetic in just about every scene shes in). Her appearance disrupts the established order of the Glade especially when her mysterious connection to Thomas is revealed.Every day two ""runners"" take off once the gate to the Maze opens tasked with mapping the ever-shifting labyrinth to find a way out. They must return before days end when the gate closes or spend the night inside where huge biomechanical spiderlike creatures called Grievers roam searching for human victims. The films ultimate theme -- so fitting for young viewers -- is the choice between accepting the safe orderly status quo or challenging all that to find out what lies beyond. The contrast between the lush Glade and the thick ugly scarred walls of the Maze highlights this. When the conflict finally materializes the movie gets interesting. The scenes inside the Maze are so claustrophobic the moviegoer can actually feel it. Wes Ball whos directing his first full-length feature does a good job of balancing the humanity of the Glades inhabitants (though it takes a while to become invested in the characters) with the threat looming outside. Some of the action scenes though unfurl so rapidly it can be difficult to keep track of whats happening. The acting is strong though it remains to be seen whether OBrien can carry a franchise like a Jennifer Lawrence (doubtful). Scodelarios Teresa is more nuanced and interesting and will bear watching in the sequels. The films ending with its lazy cliches nearly unravels all ""Maze Runners"" good work. Fortunately a final surprise (at least to those who havent read the books) helps mitigate some of the silliness.""The Hunger Games"" aside ""The Maze Runner"" has the biggest potential of the YA action franchises with more room to maneuver storywise than ""Divergent"" or some of the others. They might want to hurry. By the time the Star Wars and Justice League films start their box office reign there may not be much interest in the post-apocalyptic dystopian future genre.

As world-creation YA pictures go ""The Maze Runner"" feels refreshingly low-tech and properly story-driven based on James Dashners popular 2009 fantasy novel. Much of the action unfolds in a large field and the spidery thingies that crawl out of the woodwork to afflict a band of boys trying to escape a mysterious confinement have an old-fashioned bio-mechanical charm. Though the pacing drags a bit in the first hour and theres not much character development unless you count the casts bicep-building hours at the gym Wes Balls feature debut builds solidly to an exciting battle finale and a big reveal that doubles as coming-of-age parable. Though the addition of a lone girl feels tacked on if the film doesnt beef up the summers watery box office it wont be for lack of female bums in seats. Girls flock to action and horror these days especially when they come plentifully stocked with the comely likes of ""Teen Wolfs"" Dylan OBrien and his band of muscled bros. ""The Maze Runner"" plunges in -- as it must or give the game away to the five teenagers who have not read Dashners bestselling novel -- with room-shattering noises off as a buff young fellow (OBrien) is transported in a cage he knows not where or why or by whom to a landscape that at first blush closely resembles an Outward Bound campsite. Indeed those who remember their days at summer camp with fondness may wish to linger in the Glade a huge field dotted with handmade lean-tos knotted ropes and tanned ax-wielding ethnically diverse boys who make fun of the baffled new arrival who has momentarily forgotten his own name. A helpful hazing brings it back and Thomas quickly if not quiescently acclimates to the Glade which for all its bucolic beauty is edged with sinister creeping vines (the film was shot in rural Louisiana) and surrounded by walls too high to scale -- and one tantalizing opening. Egged on by the regulation bully (Will Poulter) most of Thomass fellow Gladers come on like obedient frat boys crossed with ""Lord of the Flies"" castaways trying to improvise social order in the absence of adult authority. Except that nothing could be more antithetical to can-do American individualism than the bleak British fatalism of William Goldings novel. On more fronts than one ""The Maze Runner"" tells a different story an old-fashioned American tale of one boy whose resourceful courage refusal to obey rules and emergent leadership skills carry a raggedy army of prisoners to freedom and responsibility for a catastrophically fallen world. Though he operates his own CGI company first-time director Ball handles special effects with impressive economy as they pertain organically to the story. If anything the action dawdles a bit for its first hour dwelling on setup until at last Thomas accompanied by a muscled pal (Ki Hong Lee) with whipped hair breaches the forbidden opening in the wall and enters the dread Maze which has no exit and from which no one returns unscathed. Only then do we meet the Grievers -- giant hairy tarantula-like critters that patrol this dank labyrinth dispensing sticky stuff and nasty stingers that kill and maim on demand. Back and forth go Thomas and company between these two building courage resolve and ingenuity as they go. The last girl on Earth shows up to lend a hand mysteriously murmuring Thomass name and raining missiles on the boys from the treehouse where they hold her. More Kristen Stewart than Jennifer Lawrence Teresa (played by Kaya Scodelario of the British television series ""Skins"") is enchantingly rumpled un-buffed and equipped with only a hard stare from her striking blue eyes. Scodelarios one-of-the-lads brio is a touch wasted here for Teresa adds little to the story other than to jog Thomas memories of whence he came and spur him on to mobilize the troops for a climactic battle to free themselves from the Maze. The great Patricia Clarkson bows in all too briefly to upend the teams sense of their past and their future. If the rites of passage feel a touch perfunctory and hasty -- well you can never go wrong telling teenagers that theyre different special and chosen to lead a broken world forward into ""The Maze Runner Part Deux.""

Brendan Sullivan says February 22 2015 at 1231 am In my opinion it was not at all a ""solid adaption"". There are a lot of reasons but I will just say two. Firstly Grievers are not spiders at all according to the book. Secondly they way the got out of the maze was dy using the maps that were spelling out letters. In the movie they find a piece of metal and hook it up. Reply pratikshya2 says January 7 2015 at 706 pm Personally i really liked the movie... The twists and turns every ten to fifteen minutes is so unexpected and shocking youd find it difficult to take a break before watching the complete movie. And I bet youd watch it at one go without pauses let alone breaks It has so many nail biting moments I lost count of them all. And enough of what is going to happen next? moments to keep you hooked. My eyes were bulging out of my sockets in anticipation the entire 1 hour 50 minutes of the movie. This one is worth a watch for all thriller lovers. Reply Daniel Garrett Irwin says September 10 2014 at 228 pm I wonder how well it will do at the box-office considering the YA demographic and track records.

TWITTER Dylan OBrien and Kaya Scodelario co-star in Wes Ballas feature directing debut a futuristic teen thriller When Fox picked up the feature version of animator Wes Balls short film Ruin in 2012 the deal quickly led to the studio offering Ball The Maze Runner as his full-length directing debut. Entrusted with the first novel in author James Dashners futuristic series of four young adult books Ball appears to be implementing a strategy thats predicated more on quickly launching a film franchise than developing a substantive long-form narrative. When The Maze Runner was published in 2009 it became a New York Times best-seller and its easy to understand why Dashner has fashioned a distinctive if derivative dystopian storyline thats easily recognizable along with archetypal characters engaged in a constant thrilling struggle for their lives. Although the principal protagonists survival is never seriously in doubt its threatened frequently enough to maintain interest so with anticipation regarding the novels adaptation already running high the release is likely to see substantive response from teens and Dashners literary fans. Ball opens the film with Thomas (Dylan OBrien) arriving in the Glade at the center of the Maze just like every other teen boy before him -- on a freight elevator that unloads him and some meager cargo in a vast open area covered by meadows and woods thats surrounded by massive concrete walls. Unable to remember any details from his past hes quickly assimilated into the makeshift society that the population of several dozen teens has created even though all of them suffer from a similar state of trauma-induced amnesia. Alby (Aml Ameen) the first arrival and Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) form the leadership team and enforcer Gally (Will Poulter) provides any physical persuasion required to keep everyone in line performing their assigned tasks. Gardeners and goat herders provision the camp craftsmen fashion shelters and tools but the Runners get the most respect. Every night the Maze that surrounds the Glade shifts configuration and every day the Runners enter the labyrinth guided by Minho (Ki Hong Lee) to map each iteration in an ongoing quest to find a way out but they must return to the Glade before nightfall and the emergence of the terrifying Grievers giant spider-like biomechanical predators that patrol the Maze. After more than three years of exploration theyre still searching for the secret to the Maze but it takes Thomas unique perspective to open up new possibilities when hes quickly promoted to Runner after helping Alby and Minho survive a night in the Maze an unprecedented feat. The arrival of Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) the only girl ever sent to the Glade upsets the delicate social order further particularly since she appears to have some mysterious connection with Thomas although neither can remember exactly what it might be. Thomas and Minhos search continues to turn up more clues including an electronic device retrieved from a slaughtered Griever that might help them unlock the Mazes inner workings. But with Alby gravely injured in a Griever attack and Gally aggressively pushing back against any attempts to abandon the Glade Thomas and Teresa will need to convince the other boys that a direct and strategic penetration of the Maze is their best hope for escape and survival. The Maze Runners similarities to well-known literary works (Nineteen Eighty-Four and Lord of the Flies among them) and speculative fiction thrillers (Logans Run Battle Royale and The Hunger Games for instance) are almost more reassuring than disconcerting. In fact its this recurrent sense of familiarity rather than any distinct originality that makes the film consistently engaging although never outright challenging. This lack of narrative sophistication is exemplified by ""WCKD"" the mysterious organization directed by Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) that has trapped the kids in the Maze and consistently thwarts their attempts to discover the justification for their incarceration making belated third-act plot revelations far more frustrating than gratifying. You cant blame the kids for all the confusion however. With most of his memories inaccessibly buried in his subconscious Thomas becomes a bundle of instincts and impulses dominated by a restless curiosity that OBrien expresses rather realistically. Scodelario doesnt figure in the action until well into the film when she initially causes a sensation by disrupting the masculine equilibrium but then gets quickly relegated to sidekick status. Equally lacking in backstory most of the sizable supporting cast has scant opportunity to build character although Brodie-Sangster and Poulter are better differentiated as Thomas advocate and antagonist respectively. Clarkson barely registers in the films final scenes and Lees Minho character gets drastically shortchanged; a significant slip-up considering his integral role investigating the mystery of the Maze. Aside from some uneven handling of the cast Ball competently styles the action sequences throughout the film and capitalizes on his VFX expertise with pulse-pounding scenes tracking the Runners through the Maze battling Grievers. Whether Ball will next get the chance to put his talents toward directing Ruin or The Scorch Trials the second novel in Dashners series thats already in development at Fox may well depend on the initial success of The Maze Runner.

Maze Runner Actor Blake Cooper Joins Amazon Pilot Cocked (Exclusive) Part ""Lord of the Flies"" and part ""Cabin in the Woods"" this puzzle-box gets less interesting as we learn more about whats going on ""Youre not like the others."" If theres a Mad Libs for YA adaptations that line is pretty much a permanent fixture; at least as far back as the Harry Potter movies every one of these franchises (from ""Hunger Games"" to ""Divergent"" to ""The Giver"") revolves around The Photogenic Messiah the one-of-a-kind teenager whos better stronger smarter faster and who winds up saving the world and getting the girl/boy. That last part doesnt exactly apply to ""The Maze Runner"" since theres only one girl for our hero Thomas (Dylan OBrien MTVs ""Teen Wolf"") to fall in love with and both of them are too busy fighting amnesia and monsters to make goo-goo eyes at each other. (There are plenty of boys of course but thats a can of worms this movie isnt about to open.) See video Monsters Invade in New Maze Runner Trailer Starring Dylan OBrien (Video) Thomas wakes up in a loud (the Dolby sound mix is bowel-rattling) freight elevator hurtling toward an unknown destination that turns out to be The Glade a mysterious encampment inhabited by a multi-ethnic group of male teenagers who have been living there for three years. Like Thomas none of them remember how they got there or what their lives were before they arrived. They grow their own food raise their own livestock and maintain their own system of government (under the wise and rational eye of older teen Alby played by Aml Ameen) because theres no way to escape. At the edge of the Glade is a massive labyrinth the internal walls of which shift around every day making mapping of the maze next to impossible despite the best efforts of the ""runners"" the communitys strongest and fastest who travel through the maze every day and make sure to be out before nightfall. This maze is also populated with ""grievers"" hideous giant scorpion-like creatures that appear to be part organic and part robot. Also read 7 Breakout Movie Stars of Fall 2014 - From a Gone Girl to a Maze Runner In true Photogenic Messiah form Thomas immediately goes about upsetting the apple cart; one of the runners stung by a griever attacks Thomas and babbles madly that all of this is Thomas fault. Thomas manages to be the first inhabitant of the Glade to kill a griever which leads to a swift and terrifying reprisal. Then the elevator returns bearing a girl for the first time Teresa (Kaya Scodelario ""Skins"") clutching a note saying that she is the last shipment. Who put these teens here and for what purpose? Its an intriguing premise at first anyway in Noah Oppenheim and Grant Pierce Myers adaptation of the novel by James Dashner. But the more we learn about Thomas and Teresas shared nightmarish memories and the closer the movie gets to its requisite ""to be continued"" climax the less interesting it all seems. Also read Divergent Trilogy Closer Allegiant Drafts Maze Runner Writer Noah Oppenheim ""The Maze Runner"" has ""Lord of the Flies"" (stripped of all socio-political context) and even a bit of ""The Cabin in the Woods"" in its DNA but the progression of the plot drags it toward being just another YA adaptation. (Is it even a spoiler to say that theres an apocalypse involved?) Kudos to casting director Denise Chamian for making the inhabitants of the Glade such a diverse and interesting group -- were forced to meet a lot of characters at once but the movie wisely casts young actors with interesting faces (Thomas Brodie-Sangster Ki Hong Lee Will Poulter Blake Cooper) who register quickly and then hold our attention throughout the film. For its first half or so ""The Maze Runner"" tells a captivating tale of survival and weaves a potentially interesting mystery. Once its path become clear however you realize this is a puzzle youve worked out before. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
