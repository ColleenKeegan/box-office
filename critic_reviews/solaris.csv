Solaris a romantic drama set in outer space that probes the nature of love redemption and guilt is about as far away from his previous films as he could get. Last year the filmmaker had a hit with the glossily entertaining all-star ensemble Oceans Eleven. This year he failed to interest audiences in Full Frontal a nonlinear Hollywood satire. Two years ago he won an Oscar for Traffic a serious drama about drug trafficking. He also directed Julia Roberts to an Oscar in Erin Brockovich about an unlikely crusader with a penchant for push-up brassieres. One wouldnt have guessed he would try a sci-fi adventure next. Movie review Solaris ( out of four) Solaris is a remake of Russian director Andrei Tarkovksys 1972 film. But in Soderberghs hands the movie is more cerebral and emotional than most that take place in space. Solaris bears a closer resemblance to 2001 A Space Odyssey than it does to Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones. The story set at an unspecified time in the future centers on George Clooney who plays a widowed psychiatrist asked to investigate inexplicable behavior aboard a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. The scientists have terminated all communication with Earth and the missions commander has died mysteriously. Clooney finds the two remaining scientists (Jeremy Davies and Viola Davis) reclusive and paranoid. As he begins to unravel the mystery he plunges deeply into his own torment and is haunted by remorse over the death of his troubled wife (Natascha McElhone). Soderbergh focuses on the love story between Clooney and McElhone. Among the most powerful sequences shown in flashback is their meeting and subsequent lovemaking. McElhone and Clooney share longing glances at a party and a conversation fraught with sensuality. Its as if nobody else is in the room. Soon no one else is and theres an artfully photographed naked slow dance. The lovemaking is reminiscent of the sexy scenes between Clooney and Jennifer Lopez in Out of Sight wordless encounters with quick cuts forward and back in time accompanied by an evocative score. Clooney does a convincing job as the tortured psychiatrist plagued by the death of his mate and McElhone gives a wrenching performance as his emotionally unstable wife. Davies also is strong as a hyperkinetic scientist who unravels over the course of the movie. Soderbergh does a fine job creating a moody atmosphere of pervasive anxiety. The ending can be interpreted a few different ways and should ignite debate about its meaning. Solaris is science fiction drama for those who dont necessarily like science fiction. There isnt much in the way of futuristic technology and there are no identifiable aliens. Its more about the complexity of peoples thoughts and emotions than about space exploration or the challenges of the future.

(AP Photo/Bob Marshak) Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) has a shocking reunion with his beloved wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone) in twentieth Century Foxs "" ."" (AP Photo/Bob Marshak) Photo BOB MARSHAK Soderberghs Solaris is all surface and cold as Kubrick 1 / 2 Back to Gallery SOLARIS Science-fiction. Starring George Clooney and Natascha McElhone. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (PG-13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Steven Soderbergh is an adventurous filmmaker an iconoclast among big-name directors who has maintained his independent roots and reserves his right to make small weird pictures any time he pleases. Anyone who loves movies appreciates what a fine thing that can be but all good things come with a price. And the bill arrives today in the form of ""Solaris"" a ponderous and dreadful film set mainly in a futuristic space station. Starring the affable -- but here terminally depressed -- George Clooney the movies cinematography and greenish color palette bares a family resemblance to better Soderbergh films such as ""Traffic."" The compositions are impeccable. The director knows exactly where to place the camera to create the right mood. But the mood of ""Solaris"" is one of unrelieved gloom and it soon begins to feel like a pose. Without a flicker of Soderberghs usual wit ""Solaris"" comes across as less than a spontaneous work of the heart and more like a grim-faced stab at artistic importance. Clooney plays Kelvin a widowed psychologist going about his mundane joyless existence in a not-so distant future. (His clothing looks like today but his TV screen is a lot flatter than anything currently on the market.) His normal glum routine is soon interrupted when a friend living on a space station near the planet Solaris sends him a transmission He needs Kelvin to come right away. Something bad is happening. He cant say what. No one can say what. In a compelling early scene Kelvin arrives on the station to find suspicious-looking blood stains and only two surviving crew members. One of them is played by the spooky and amusing Jeremy Davies who tells him ""I can tell you whats happening but I dont know if thatll tell you whats happening."" The other crew member (Viola Davis) is even less forthcoming ""Until it happens to you theres really no point in discussing it."" Actually their reticence is just a conceit of the storytelling because a little advance warning would make perfect sense. People on the station are going to bed and waking up to find in their room someone theyve lost someone they most want to see in the world. For Kelvin its his late wife Rheya played by Natascha McElhone. Apparently Solaris the planet being studied is in turn studying the crew members. From the information contained in their minds the planet is making duplicates of loved ones. That sounds intriguing and one can see why the concept grabbed Soderbergh. (It also grabbed the late Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky who in 1972 made an equally inert ""Solaris"" from Stanislaw Lems novel of the same name.) But while the story might at least seem to suggest an emotional movie about life death identity grief joy and obsession ""Solaris"" feels as though it were filmed in a meat locker. It gives a cold-as-Kubrick treatment to touchy-feely subject matter and keeps the audience at a distance. So we get a love story but a love story made up either of tortured confrontations seen in flashback or long conversations in space. Someone speaks. Long pause. Someone else speaks. Long pause. Ingmar Bergman no less would be snapping his fingers saying ""Get on with it."" Whats worse the slowness and heaviness make up only the pretense of emotion. Its all surface. Soderberghs screenplay doesnt go to the deep places but stays on a heady barren plane. The love of this mans life has just come back. Theres no ecstasy no exuberance. There are just discussions about the new Rheyas existential reality. Shes a copy of Rheya but shes not Rheya. This causes her some anxiety. To be more specific shes a copy of the Rheya in Kelvins mind and that causes him anxiety. A potentially intense situation degenerates into the ultimate in solipsism. When he looks at her hes looking into himself. And were looking at a man look into himself. The view is not that interesting. The effect is in fact trance-like and trance-inducing and this quality is only emphasized by Cliff Martinezs minimalist Philip Glass-like score. Occasionally someone will look out the window of the station and well see a red swirling something that is supposed to be Solaris but looking out the window is about as close to the outdoors as we get in this highly interior piece. It comes as a surprise to find out that ""Solaris"" is not a low-budget movie. It looks like it. Advisory This film contains sexual situations.

His last film Full Frontal a low-budget palate-cleanser was greeted with breathtaking vituperation by critics who somehow seemed to find it more pretentious than say Road to Perdition. His daring new project Solaris is a dead-serious big-budget remake of the fabled 1972 art film by the late Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky. As such it threatens to alienate both the mass audience that expects a normal George Clooney movie and cineastes loyal to the original Even before Soderbergh began shooting a Tarkovsky fan chased him down the streets of Manhattan yelling ""You should be ashamed of yourself"" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Really? A piece of metaphysical sci-fi the original film was conceived as a response to Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey which Tarkovsky found technically dazzling but inhuman. Giving its story the full Russian treatment (its deep-dish philosophical discussions come garnished with Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky) Tarkovskys portentous 165-minute yarn unfolded at about the same pleasurable pace as global warming. When I saw it back in college I found it almost un-watchable and embraced David Thomsons verdict that an episode of Star Trek had explored the same themes ""with more wit and ingenuity less sentimentality and at a third the length."" Clocking in at a lean 96 minutes Soderberghs Solaris is a pared-down sliver of storytelling and like the original almost incidentally a work of science fiction. Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin a disillusioned shrink whos spent years grieving for his dead wife Rheya when he receives an enigmatic call for help from a scientist friend on a space station near Solaris a swirling oceanic planet which the crew is discovering is essentially a gigantic brain. Arriving at the station he finds his pal dead and the place deserted except for a jittery geek named Snow (Jeremy Davies) whose mind mouth and hands play to different time signatures and Gordon (Viola Davis) a stolid researcher who for some reason doesnt want to leave her cabin. A vast pulsing consciousness Solaris has the ability to bring human memories to life and as Kelvin sleeps Rheya (Natascha McElhone) shows up in his room. Freaked out he activates a space pod and banishes the simulacrum into deep space. But Rheya keeps coming back (imagine a melancholy version of Groundhog Day) and though he knows shes merely a living breathing emanation the lovesick Kelvin starts sleeping with her wondering whether he can save the new Rheya to atone for not saving his real wife back on Earth. In telling this tautly elliptical story of love memory guilt and redemption Soderbergh has deliberately avoided Tarkovskys trademark slow pace and long takes. Kelvins dreamlike reality is caught in the films look with its hallucinatory crispness symbolic battle between golds and blues (a la Traffic) and occasional use of tight focus to give background or foreground shapes an ambiguous fluidity. This is a movie about seeing and Soderbergh pays careful attention to his characters eyes -- we watch them light up change color and fall so deeply into shadow that they resemble black hollow sockets. If his visual style here has a shortcoming its that his images have the burnished allure of a good Calvin Klein ad -- arresting but ultimately unmemorable. Theres none of the transcendent imagery you find in well Tarkovsky. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

He wins a forceful turn from Viola Davis who gives Gordon a ferocious sense of rationality. When she insists that the new Rheya isnt human she knows exactly what shes saying (even if it makes her sound inhumane). Eventually so does Rheya herself who like a fugitive from a Philip K. Dick novel comes to realize that shes not a real woman but only a sentient figment of Kelvins memories and desires. This weird identity crisis -- am I real or just someones dream come to life? -- makes her Solaris most poignant character and draws out McElhones richest screen performance to date. In the actress best scene Kelvin keeps asking if shes all right and Rheya keeps saying ""Yeah"" her awareness of her tragic situation growing each time she says it. UNTIL NOW GEORGE CLOONEY HAS ALWAYS seemed a present-day version of Cary Grant or Clark Gable (both of whom he successfully knocked off in O Brother Where Art Thou?) -- an old-school movie star better known for virile charm than inner depth. Hes taken a big chance with Kelvin a role that forces him to an impressive new level of emotionalism For a guy whos spent his career playing cool hes strikingly good at acting scared freaked-out shattered. (Whether audiences want this from him is another question.) Caught in ever more tortured bafflement he moves around the space station with an odd clenched walk and a spooked expression of existential distress. Oddly enough Clooneys at his worst in the gilded rather trite flashbacks to Kelvin and Rheyas previous life together -- precisely the scenes that come closest to asking him to ""do Clooney."" The same is true of Solaris as a whole which is far more compelling in space than it is on terra firma. The flashbacks to planet Earth are far too explicit cheating Kelvin and Rheyas relationship of its potential depth and mystery. (Julia Roberts and Albert Finney shared a far more resonant bond in Erin Brockovich.) And although the deft use of flashbacks is a Soderbergh touchstone here the earthbound romance is so tinny that Clooney and McElhone had to win me back each time we returned to Solaris. They never fully did. While I could tell the love story was supposed to be moving I kept feeling the characters passion struggling against the virtuosity of Soderberghs direction which is so tight so gorgeously lit so worked that even when he wants scenes to be emotionally incandescent they wind up detached even chilly. Unlike Todd Haynes in Far From Heaven (which Soderbergh and Clooney helped produce) he hasnt yet found a way to make his personal projects touch us. This isnt to say Solaris is insincere. Soderbergh has talked in interviews of his personal remoteness and here you feel him bravely pushing himself toward new levels of personal exposure and artistic ambition. If he doesnt wholly succeed this is at least partly due to the profound culture clash at this projects very core. Following his own tastes (think of Kafka) Soderbergh has taken a story that makes perfect sense in romantic metaphysics-mad Eastern Europe then -- heroically -- tried to make it fit within the constraints of Hollywood filmmaking. I watched much of the new Solaris with the sense that something often felt slightly ""off"" about the characters and their preoccupations. Then during the dinner-party scene when Kelvin Rheya and their friends talk with almost comical maladroitness about God and the universe I realized what it was They seem to have been imported from a foreign movie. Which of course they were. An added dividend of seeing Soderberghs Solaris is that it sent me back for a second look at Tarkovskys which I caught on the spanking-new Criterion DVD with its ravishing print elegant introductory essay by critic Philip Lopate and interviews with (among others) Stanislaw Lem the Polish science-fiction novelist who wrote the 1960 original considered something of a classic. This time I was patient. To appreciate the film you must give yourself over to its slow rhythms which eventually enfold you in a profound sense of moral gravity that Soderberghs faster pace never quite reaches. Doing so I discovered that the 1972 Solaris is full of pleasures and fascinations be it the milky-watery evocation of the planet Solaris the hypnotic five-minute scene of a car driving through the futuristic-looking outskirts of 70s Tokyo (shades of Alphaville) or an exquisite 30 seconds of weightlessness when a floating candelabrum grazes a chandelier prompting it to shiver. Halfway through Tarkovskys film a character declares ""In my opinion we have lost our sense of the cosmic."" For reasons of culture as much as anything else that loss is felt acutely in Soderberghs Solaris which is rooted in American psychologism not Slavic spirituality. In an interview on the DVD Lem talks about how Tarkovsky missed the point of his novel by focusing on the metaphysical allure of Russian soil rather than on the excitement of new discoveries on Solaris. He disliked Tarkovskys movie and Id guess that Tarkovsky wouldnt like Soderberghs which he would doubtless find vulgar (one pictures him shuddering at the sight of Clooneys bare buns). But who cares? Its fascinating to have so many different interpretations of the same story and we dont have to see them in opposition. Though I will admit that I was terribly wrong about one thing Tarkovskys version is undeniably better -- and certainly more visionary -- than Gene Roddenberrys.

A loose remake of Andrei Tarkovskys soporific 1972 Russian epic (both are based on Stanislaw Lems novel) the movie in its perverse way fits snugly into the Hollywood bean counters corrupt view of the universe - namely that there are two kinds of movies big accessible popular entertainments and small ""elite"" films doomed to commercial oblivion. When a celebrated filmmaker begins to think that way it can be a convoluted form of self-sabotage (and self-glorification). Snail-paced suavely shot and steeped in postmodern melancholy ""Solaris"" is like ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" directed by Michelangelo Antonioni. Soderbergh is making a movie all right but more than that he?s flaunting his cred his power as a hip industry player helping to position a quasi-obscure 70s-style art film in the thick of the holiday/Oscar rush. Its as if he wanted us to think Is this guy a cool industry rebel or what? The irony is that Soderbergh in essence has come up with a plodding and far less psychologically arresting version of ""Ghost."" Set in the murky dystopic future ""Solaris"" casts George Clooney as Chris Kelvin a lonely psychologist who is ordered by some vague corporate-political nexus to travel out to the space station ""Prometheus"" and rectify a mission gone mysteriously haywire. Most of the crew has disappeared as if the beast from ""Alien"" had already been through and eaten dinner. But once Kelvin comes onboard the satellite station with its vast mechanical network of catwalks (the set looks like it was built out of the worlds biggest Erector set) he encounters two strangely obsessed survivors fearful intense Gordon (Viola Davis) and jittery spaced-out Snow (Jeremy Davies). More tellingly Kelvin discovers his beautiful wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone) who appears before him in his sleep chamber. Hes deeply grateful to see her considering she killed herself several years before. Has Rheya truly come back to life? Or is she a figment of Kelvins memory a pod replicant or somehow both at once - a metaphysical projection brought on by Solaris the gassy purple-pink planet below? The movie treats this mystery as if it were rife with significance especially when Kelvin haunted by Rheyas death becomes possessed by the notion that its actually her alive and returned to him. He seems to be the only person on screen who doesnt get that hes stuck in an utterly conventional science-fiction predicament. As ""Solaris"" goes on we get flashback glimpses of Kelvins marriage how he and Rheya flirted embraced naked in the dark and began to come apart. The movie wants to be a poetic evocation of Loss but since the relationship as shown remains naggingly sketchy and abstract its hard to work up much feeling over its demise or its restoration. McElhone is certainly someone to pine for - there are depths to her apple-cheeked sculptural beauty - but Clooney may be too swank an actor to suffer this moodily. He is rather the perfect poster idol for a film that serves up romantic tragedy as stylishly cryptic solemnity chic.

"Solaris | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; solaris ) Solaris (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Solaris may be the first big budget science fiction motion picture that belongs in an art house rather than a multiplex. The movie bears a stronger resemblance to 2001 A Space Odyssey than to Star Wars with an emphasis on ideas over action. Those expecting to see space battles and bug-eyed aliens will be disappointed. Theres nothing like that here. The experience of watching Solaris doesnt just invite thought and rumination; it demands it. Of his last four films Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh has developed three remakes (besides this one the other two are Traffic and Oceans 11). Solaris is based on the novel by Stanisalw Lem which was first brought to the screen in 1972 by Soviet filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky. The earlier film which clocks in at a lengthy 165 minutes is as slow as it is fascinating. Soderberghs re-interpretation which is more economical (its about 65 minutes shorter) has many of the same strengths as Tarkovskys version without the somnambulant pace. Soderberghs Solaris establishes a dreamlike state that allows events to unfold in an unhurried fashion without losing a patient audiences attention. Solaris transpires at an unspecified time in the near future. Therapist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) travels to a space station orbiting the distant planet of Solaris after a friend requests his help analyzing a problem that the crew of the station has encountered. When Chris arrives he finds that his friend is among the dead and there are only two survivors a the laid-back Snow (Jeremy Davies) and the paranoid Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis). Although neither Snow nor Gordon provides helpful information Chris soon discovers on his own whats transpiring when he receives a visitation from his dead wife Rhea (Natascha McElhone). Rhea does not appear to be a hallucination or a ghost and that leaves Chris with a serious issue to resolve Is she real or not and if she is what is she? Solaris examines weighty issues like the power of guilt the nature of life and the importance of memory. There are no traditional antagonists in this film; Chris greatest enemy is a burden of conscience that he carries with him the presence of which weighs down his soul and clouds his judgment. Initially he doesnt believe his visitor is Rhea. Later he no longer cares. The presence of someone who looks feels and sounds identical to his dead wife gives him an opportunity to assuage the pain of misplaced responsibility. For George Clooney while appearing in this movie may not be a big career risk its certainly an atypical choice. Known for playing supremely confident men in mainstream Hollywood outings Clooney uses this opportunity to display his range and perhaps court a different audience. (His ""safety net"" may be that he has worked twice previously with Soderbergh and obviously feels comfortable with the director.) He capably brings out the deeply rooted pain and need in Chris and we never have any difficulty accepting him in this role. The other performers have less significant parts. Clooney is the one who carries the film. Solaris brought to the screen by Soderbergh and James Cameron (who produced) is a gorgeously rendered motion picture. The cinematography connects us with Chris allowing us to experience things through his perspective (sometimes literally). Flashbacks fill in the story of Chris tempestuous marriage to Rhea including how it began and ended. The special effects are breathtaking and flawless a some of the best to grace the screen this year. They dont represent a big part of the story but when they are used they are effective. The number of ""thinking"" science fiction films is small and most are produced on small budgets for start-up directors. The first-rate production values and A-list star make Solaris an exception a and a rewarding one at that. This is the first film I have seen in a long time to make me feel some of the things I experienced while watching 2001. Solaris is neither as effective nor as ambitious as Kubricks masterpiece but its still a compelling cinematic experience for those who are willing to abandon themselves to the unforced measured rhythms of an issues-based motion picture.

This second screen version of Stanislaw Lems novel is technically superb but suspense-free story here is a galaxy away from ""Alien"" territory and makes for a pure art film. A brooding attempt at a metaphysical meditation on love lost and regained ""Solaris"" is an investigation of primal emotions approached in an entirely cerebral manner. Largely set aboard a spacecraft but a sci-fi entry in name only this second screen version of Stanislaw Lems novel is technically superb and features a strong serious performance by George Clooney as a doctor sent to deep space to check out the strange fate of another crafts crew. But despite the setup mysterious but suspense-free story here is a galaxy away from ""Alien"" territory and makes for a pure art film about which mainstream audiences wont have a clue prefiguring distinctly modest B.O. in most situations. As far as Steven Soderbergh is concerned its now evident that 2002 will go down as a year of experimentation after his remarkable commercial and artistic run that included winning an Oscar for ""Traffic."" Whereas the recent ""Full Frontal"" seemed to please almost no one ""Solaris"" likely will develop a following among some critics and serious cinephiles who will value the intellectually ambitious and defiantly uncommercial nature of Soderberghs undertaking more than they will mind its lack of genuine depth and profundity. Despite its undeniably pure and earnest intent ""Solaris"" is equally undeniably an arid dull affair that imposes and maintains a huge distance between the viewer and what happens onscreen and never successfully negotiates the paradox of being a study of the deepest emotions that doesnt engage the heart for a moment. Previous version of the book directed in 1972 by Russian auteur Andrei Tarkovsky was both a tour de force and at 165 minutes a chore to sit through. Too conveniently celebrated by some as a Soviet response to ""2001"" pic did offer a distinctive aesthetic and a genuinely mystical dimension that presented an inchoate but nonetheless intriguing challenge to prevailing Soviet philosophy and approved subject matter. Working in his own way against conventional norms and the expectations of Hollywood commercial cinema (and gratifyingly cutting the running time by more than an hour) Soderbergh turns the material in a more personal direction to make it something close to a ""Scenes From a Marriage in Outer Space."" Grieving over the death of his wife psychologist Chris Kelvin (Clooney) agrees to an urgent appeal to visit the distant space station Prometheus find out why the crew has ceased communication and bring them back home; in a videotaped plea for his close friend to come to the rescue mission commander Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur) cryptically cautions that he ""cant be specific"" about whats going on up there. The early earthbound scenes are among the films most beautiful. Dramatically composed isolated shots showing the doctor at home in therapy and on the rain-swept streets of what is presumably a future Los Angeles possess richly resonant dark coloration with some of the blackest blacks seen onscreen in recent memory. Without suggesting that he is becoming any less a director it can be said that Soderbergh (working as usual under the nom de camera of Peter Andrews) is becoming an increasingly expert cinematographer; working mostly in close-ups with longish lenses he keeps the focus tightly upon his actors as sets provide a lustrous but impersonal backdrop. Arriving at Prometheus which soars above the eponymous gaseous-looking planet Chris finds Gibarian dead and the two surviving crew members in a very strange state. Affected young scientist Snow (Jeremy Davies) jabbers on without managing to say anything coherent about whats afflicting them while the formidable Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis) who has retreated to her room warns Chris ""Until it starts happening to you theres really no point in discussing it."" What happens to Chris on his first night there is a vivid dream about his entrancing first encounter and initial night of lovemaking with his wife-to-be Rheya (Natascha McElhone). Upon awakening he finds Rheya or someone/something just like her next to him in the flesh. Thus begins a long almost clinical inquiry into the history of their marriage paralleled with the attempt by both Chris and Rheya to figure out exactly whats happening between them on board the spaceship. Flashes of intense intimate moments from the past delineate the quick anger-fueled deterioration of the marriage while the present soon becomes enshrouded in uncertainty as Rheya admits to suspicions that ""Im not the person I remember."" Chris and Rheya hope to learn from their mistakes the first time around to make their relationship work now but all the introspection and angst pay uncertain dividends amidst the anxiety over the reliability of memory and doubts as to whether the ""new"" Rheya is human at all. This makes the climactic stab at redemption a particularly murky matter that will leave most viewers wondering what the hell it was they just watched -- and it wont be their fault. However cold and obscure the entire venture may be individual scenes have been made with commendable rigor and dispatch and an unerring eye for texture. The piquant flashbacks leave no doubt as to the highly charged amorous nature of Chris and Rheyas relationship and Clooney does a highly creditable job of carrying the films freight on his shoulders even as the cargo becomes increasingly unwieldy. McElhone is very good in the direct verbal exchanges with her co-star but it would no doubt lie beyond any thesp to transcend the confusion that overtakes the role in the late going. Davis commands the screen whenever shes on while the weirdly gesticulating Davies appears grubby and mannered. Production values are in a word stellar with an understated emphasis on realism. Philip Messinas production design makes the technical world of this unspecified time in the future entirely plausible while Milena Canoneros costume design takes similarly modest but creative liberties with current fashion. Cliff Martinezs resourceful score makes unusual use of steel drum and gamelan instrumentations and sound mix is exceptional.
