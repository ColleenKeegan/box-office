Claire Folger/Sony Pictures/AP x The high-concept comedies spawned by ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" need to start using birth control. Movie review 2 1/2 (out of five stars)Director Jake KasdanCast Jason Segel Cameron Diaz Rob Corddry Ellie Kemper Rob LoweRated R for strong sexual content nudity language and some drug useRunning time 1 hour 35 minutes Judd Apatows landmark film rightfully ushered in a new era in comedy but it also has inspired a now sizable cottage industry of thin movies (""The Hangover"" ""The Five-Year Engagement"" ""Bad Teacher"" ""Horrible Bosses"") with good titles but shallow stories. Of these only one (""The Five-Year Engagement"") had Apatows imprimatur. He and his cohorts have mostly moved on to telling stories about various seminal chapters of life - child birth (""Knocked Up"") high-school graduation (""Superbad"") young parenthood (""Neighbors"") 30s singledom (""Bridesmaids"") middle age (""This Is 40"") - and many of these make up some of the best comedies of the last decade. ""Sex Tape"" however belongs to the former group and it marks a low point despite coming from several Apatow acolytes. Its directed by Jake Kasdan a consulting producer on ""Freaks and Geeks"" who went on to direct ""Bad Teacher."" ""Sex Tape"" reteams that films lead duo Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz the wide-smiling muse for whats now been several generations of comedy. A screwball that takes its genre literally ""Sex Tape"" is about a West L.A. married couple Annie (Diaz) and Jay (Segel) trying to reawaken their love life after years of marriage and two kids. They make a porn film for themselves that tours through the positions of ""The Joy of Sex."" In the first of many outlandish plot twists Jay hands out his old iPads like party favors at a get-together of friends and family. Hours afterward an anonymous text makes him realize that each iPad has their video stored on it due to a syncing app he favors. While this set-up could have gone somewhere interesting the screenplay by Segel his writer partners Nicholas Stoller and Kate Angelo bizarrely settles for a suburban nighttime odyssey wherein Jay and Annie try to take back the iPads. This includes a stop at their friends house a similar couple played by Ellie Kemper and Rob Corddry; a visit to Annies prospective new boss a family website CEO (Rob Lowe) who wants to buy her blog; and a Los Angeles pornography warehouse. In short its a PG plot for an X-rated story. Segels gratuitous full-frontal nudity in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" was far funnier and more surprising than anything in ""Sex Tape."" He has slimmed down notably seemingly going for a more grown-up (and alas less funny) screen presence. To its credit theres a lightness to the film and the performers are uniformly likable. When Kemper and Corddry appear you wish the movie would stick with them and their nervous energy. ""Sex Tape"" tries to bridge the gap between the traditional romantic comedy and todays porn-addled digital world. Its a valiant effort and there is something though very little of Cary Grants scampering in ""Bringing Up Baby"" to Segels mishaps around the CEOs mansion. But ""Sex Tape"" doesnt sync.

Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz had unexpected sharp-tongued chemistry in 2011s Bad Teacher; here they sag into married stasis as an exhausted two-kid couple whose passions have cooled. As will be obvious to anyone they make a (barely R-rated) sex tape to spice things up. Also a no-brainer that video will accidentally leak to the cloud promoted as if Apple were an executive producer. A manic night of erasure and iPad reclamation fills the running time along with an odd pit stop involving Rob Lowe as a sweet business exec and secret coke-snorting Slayer fan. Explicit raunch was never going to be supplied but youd think the film could at least get it up for some cringe-inducing suburban embarrassment--those scenes are too soft. Surprisingly chuckles do come from choice bits of parental nerdiness; one stupefied neighbor hearing of their three-hour sex bout compares it to the movie Lincoln. The scripts humor could have soared if channeled into a gentler vein of middle-aged self-mockery--i.e. more gags about DVR-ing Project Runway--but Segel and Diaz are too young (and too appealing) to seem believably bored by each other. Ultimately for all its running around in the middle of the night Sex Tape plays it remarkably coy reaffirming love not lust. Its the cinematic equivalent of sleeping in the wet spot.

Running time 94 minutes. Rated R (partial nudity relentless sex humor profanity drugs). The lame and surprisingly tame comedy ""Sex Tape loses stamina approximately halfway through the opening seven-minute montage of its stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel as college students having nonstop (and non-explicit) sex. Marriage and two kids later theyre too pooped to get it on -- Segel has some kind of vague job in the music industry and the ageless Diaz a blogger always looks like shes fresh from the makeup department. One night while the kids are at her moms they decide not only to do the nasty -- but with a little help from a bottle of tequila re-enact every position from the 70s DIY manual ""The Joy of Sex (dont ask why) while recording their performance for posterity on an iPad. This performance -- mercifully fast-forwarded through at the end of the movie -- looks pretty much like every other carefully staged Hollywood sex scene from the past 20 years. Segel who went full frontal for ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall sticks to displaying his newly toned butt. Diaz shows even less. The paucity of skin and utter lack of sexual heat might be more forgivable if ""Sex Tape were actually funny. But theres a mechanical desperation in the script (Segel is one of three credited writers) that requires the couple to frantically try to recover several iPads containing the incriminating video (not tape). Things arent helped by the sloppy direction of Jake Kasdan -- who previously helmed the stars in ""Bad Teacher which at least had the conviction of its bad taste. Here the sex is shoved into a family/relationship comedy (Diaz mostly nags her spouse) to cringe-worthy effect climaxing (so to speak) at a fourth-grade graduation ceremony. There are a few laughs here and there. Rob Lowe -- who in real life was a celebrity sex tape pioneer back in the VHS era -- spoofs himself as a seemingly straightlaced toy-company executive who is considering buying Diazs blog for a bundle. When the couple turns up in the middle of the night to retrieve one of their iPads from him Lowe is revealed as a coke-snorting party animal whose Southern California mansion (actually photographed like the rest of the film in Massachusetts for the tax subsidy) is filled with paintings of him posing with Disney characters (including Lowes infamous real-life Oscar co-star Snow White). But Kasdan beats that gag to death as he does Segels attempts to fight off Lowes ferocious German shepherd. And the couples pals (Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper) panting obsession with the sex tape. Even for a farce the situations stretch credulity far beyond the breaking point. This is the sort of movie where people who live in what looks like a 10 million house balk at paying a 25000 bribe and where they take the kids along while paying a nocturnal call to the servers of a sex-video Web site (where Jack Black puts in a brief but very welcome appearance). Its not really giving away anything important to report that our hapless couple ends up burning shredding and burying their labor of lust -- if only someone had done this with the digital master of ""Sex Tape. But then Sony wouldnt have collected a hefty product-placement fee for what amounts to a 90-minute commercial for corporate rival Apples iPad.

"Search and Destroy << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Wedded Blitz Do or DIY  Next NFL Trade Value Part 1 Facebook Twitter Print Movies Search and Destroy The pent-up frustrations of the The Purge Anarchy and Sex Tape by Wesley Morris on July 18 2014 Nobody gets to be a hero in The Purge Anarchy not for long. But the actor Frank Grillo really has something. Its not range or big talent. Its a life-size working-persons version of macho gravitas. Hes had minor parts in lots of movies that require him to wear stubble and Kevlar. Thats fair. Like Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen hes got the handsomeness of some cops or construction workers. He could walk off the street and onto one of those calendars. In this movie hes playing a guy named Leo Barnes whom everyone calls Sergeant who roves tentatively at night around Los Angeles in an armored car. The reason is that the government in the year 2023 has let the country fall apart. For 12 hours every March society is permitted to collapse into lawlessness just as it had in the 2013 sleeper hit The Purge. People are free to kill without incrimination. The program has been sold as an opportunity to unleash and purge aggression. Really its a not terribly opaque conspiracy to further enrich the countrys arms manufacturers limit population growth and cut the unemployment rate mostly by slaughtering the poor. This apparently is news to everybody except an outfit of black radicals whose leader (Michael K. Williams in John Lennon spectacles and a beret) posts videos vowing to strike against the empire. In the meantime Sarge just appears to be looking for personal revenge. Grillo is expressive enough to seem sad as his Batmobile lurks in the shadows. His solitude doesnt last. He happens upon a woman and her daughter being hauled into a tractor-trailer by masked soldiers. He tries to talk himself out of saving them but again Sergeant is a sergeant. I could have watched him drive around an empty downtown for 100 minutes but by the time he saves those two women and a young couple (Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez actually married) stow away in his backseat I was ready to give up and not because writer and director James DeMonaco isnt on to something. Its that what hes on to (federally sanctioned class warfare) is often illogically executed and annoyingly acted. If Sergeants sense of vengeance has direction why not take it there straight away? Whats with the dillydally? The woman and her teenage daughter are Eva (Carmen Ejogo) and Cali (Zoe Soul). Eva works as a waitress at a diner and has just failed to get the raise that Cali was counting on. Ejogo has a strong face but over and over shes required to weep and scream and on one hilariously inconvenient occasion fall down while fleeing. Shes not allowed to be more than limp. The car of that stowaway couple happened to run out of gas just as the Purge was getting under way and theyre just as weak and needy. Theyre all talky and openly desperate for Sergeant to get them out of jam after jam (a domestic drama gone wrong the killer Mexicans around the corner the punks in the traffic tunnel driving a car with a flamethrower). Sometimes they try self-defense. Mostly its ""Please help us"" If the Paul Haggis Best Picture winner Crash were an asteroid that hit Earth The Purge Anarchy would be its postapocalypse. To be fair this is just the kind of acting -- and the sorts of characters -- you also get in OK action movies and horror-thrillers. The original Purge had Ethan Hawke defending his home from invaders and he just seemed like a bonus. Grillos stoicism is even better for the occasion. Hes sculpted from classical action-hero steel. But DeMonaco is more interested in scenarios than in stocking them with human beings. Everybody here is a backstory in a T-shirt. Its the premise thats the hook and its hook isnt terribly dissimilar from the moral apocalypse of the Saw series where sadistic contraptions were supposed to punish and sometimes repunish the bad and the evil. Normally for social commentary youd get a George Romero zombie allegory or vampires apes or Katniss Everdeen. DeMonaco throws militarization at our problems and hes not kidding. The Purge movies are envisioning dystopia run by an unseen government outfit called the New Founding Fathers of America which has a nice tea party-style ring to it. That kind of totalitarianism is supposed to be creepy. But its the closing credits that create the biggest scares. In them heavy metal blasts over reconstituted American flags with guns grenades and brass knuckles where the stripes should be. Whats being satirized is American bloodlust -- or something like that. DeMonaco seems to feel entitled to have it both ways but awkwardly -- a trigger finger that wags too. Inequality immorality and bad government might enrage these movies but they thoroughly enjoy the splatter of all blood. Its funny. Sex Tape is about a man having sex with Cameron Diaz and at no point after the video of their drunken three-hour tryst is accidentally distributed did I wonder about the videos contents. Thats only partially because the man is played by Jason Segel whose economy-size frame has been transformed into a body meant to make sense atop beneath and pretzeled with Diazs. He might have overexerted himself in preparation. All the usual athleticism in his face is gone. He looks as sad and as pooped as the movie is. Diaz and Segel are Annie and Jay married parents in the Los Angeles area whom we see humping their way through college but who as wedded grown-ups have grown clueless about sex with each other. Between his sitting near a bunch of CDs at work and her mommy-blogging from the living room theres just no time to fuck anymore. They make an intimacy appointment that leads to failed sex (how he asks have we forgotten how to do this?) which leads to Annie suggesting they make a porno which leads to an epic night re-creating the recipes from The Joy of Sex. Obviously Jay fails to properly delete the video from the iPads he donates to friends and strangers (because for implausible music-oriented reasons he goes through them the way reporters go through notebooks. This is a Sony movie that may as well be by Apple). Jay finds out only because taunting texts pop up on his phone. As he and Annie run around town trying to recall the iPads it seems clear that the movie has no idea what the joke is. Maybe its that adults have no technological common sense. This alleged crisis could have ended minutes after it began. But that would mean a movie with barely a 40-minute running time. So why not have Rob Lowe try playing an Internet nebbish who wants to buy Annies blog? Why not have Jay and Annie show up at his mansion to steal the iPad she gave him that is still in its leather case? Why does she give it to him? Why does he accept it? Because sadly we need a brutally long sequence that juxtaposes Jay running from and beating up Lowes German shepherd with Annie and her prospective employer snorting cocaine and listening to Slayer. Later theres a trip to the home of their best friends played by Ellie Kemper and Rob Corddry who wind up seeing the video and fogging up Annie and Jays car. The four of them sit in a living room and talk through various scenarios and theres not a single laugh. Its strange to watch a comedy full of talented people that does not work from the opening scene. Its like eating food and not tasting anything. Segel wrote Sex Tape with Nicholas Stoller and Kate Angelo; Jake Kasdan directed it. You get the sense they started down this road and couldnt turn around. I mean Segel went to the gym a lot. Kasdan brought us Segel and Diaz in Bad Teacher. As viciously juvenile and condescending about public education as that movie was its viciousness was itself a virtue. Sex Tape winds up doing something cynical roping in Annie and Jays kids and making pronouncements about the value of family. At one point they do so at the mercy of the owner of an adult-entertainment website played by a famous comedian. He helps steal the movie by rattling off fake porn outfits like Nutflix. Its petty theft. But its needed like water to the dehydrated. I thought Date Night would have ended the nonadventures of the bored straight white and upper middle class. But popular culture has returned to combating and exploring the doldrums of a particular kind of marriage. Just this week three cable shows -- Youre the Worst Married and Satisfaction -- started bringing more tales of the pros and cons of coupledom. Sex Tape seems to be going in a different direction. It wants a similar depiction of the hot married sex advertised in Beyonces ""Drunk in Love."" That song had a ridiculous blown-sideways ecstasy (""We woke up in the kitchen saying How the hell did this shit happen?"") that never happens in the movie. You just watch Diaz and Segel trying to reel in their sex binge and keep waiting for the purge to start.

In fact its almost good enough leaning a little too hard on the innate likability of stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel. Reuniting with director Jake Kasdan from 2011s Bad Teacher they play Annie and Jay a couple of married-with-children Angelenos whose once-inexhaustible libidos seem to have Logans Run their course. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Oh is that reference to an ancient sci-fi set in a world where this sort of trouble doesnt come up much because everyone gets euthanized at age 30 obsolete? Well so is the premise of Sex Tape. This is a film that wants us to accept that Jay -- a gadget guy who has some undefined but apparently lucrative music-industry job that has earned him not merely a huge house full of framed Submarines and Belle amp; Sebastian posters but also so many extra iPads that he literally hands them out as gifts not just to close relations but to the mailman too as if hes Oprah Winfrey of Nazareth herself -- doesnt grok how the Internet works. Jays amiable sitcom-dad cluelessness might go down easier if Segel werent one of the films three credited writers (with Kate Angelo and his frequent collaborator Nicholas Stoller) but Ill buy it. There are plenty of early adopters/frequent upgraders with only a vague notion of how to use their expensive toys. The important thing is that its the latest one.Film Details Sex Tape RatingR GenreComedy Running Time94 More Info Trailer Maybe Annie pays for all their stuff. She is a professional blogger after all ka-ching ka-ching. Shes been told to expect ""a meaningful offer"" from a kids toys manufacturer that wants to buy Whos Yo Mommy? the website where she reminisces in Sex Tapes funny opening sequence about the good old days when she and her now-husband used to do it in the stacks at the library in the car on the quad in the shower etc. When she and Jay cant manage to get it together during their first night in forever away from their two adorable moppets they resort to making an iPad sex video -- and like an EpiPen spiked into the heart of their flatlined love life it works wonders. (Health warning The heart is in fact a really bad place to inject anything.) But when the three-hour video threatens to go WikiLeaks thanks to all those hand-me-down iPads Annies fat blog paydays -- and her and Jays dignity -- are endangered. And so for a very long time Sex Tape ceases to be a sex comedy and turns instead into a kinda-sorta-not-bad chase flick wherein Annie and Jay run all over the 310 area code in an effort to recover all their iPads presumably so they can use a Sharpie to redact the naughty bits. This includes a long stop at the mansion of the CEO of the company that wants to buy Annies blog. (The CEO is played by Rob Lowe no stranger to sex-tape leakage.) The sequence features a funny extended sight gag about his characters penchant for commissioning paintings of himself inserted into famous scenes from Disney cartoons. But an extended slapstick bit of a German shepherd chasing Segel through the guys mansion goes on longer than building-toppling finales of most Marvel films. Why does Jay not wipe these things before he gives them away? Annie quite reasonably demands that of him a very long time after the audience has asked this question. His answer Because his killer playlists are the gift not the device and he updates them constantly. (Actually that a Dudebro like Segels character would say that is probably the films most plausible moment.) Who among us can remember every single person to whom weve ever given a mix CD that costs 399 and up not including monthly data plan?Well. At the summertime box office as in Kansas we vote our aspirations not our reality. Just as audiences during the Great Depression flocked to comedies about nattily dressed well-spoken high-living society types perhaps the maxed-out second mortgage-holding marrieds of 2014 will be drawn to Sex Tape -- which for all its supposedly reassuring candor about how kids can sap the mojo of even the randiest couples is pretty tone deaf about how financial woes can steal it too. Kasdan used to be more attuned to this kind of thing. He started his feature career with the great and odd little comic mystery Zero Effect back in 1998. Hes done good work in TV most notably on the much praised little watched Freaks and Geeks and New Girl. Though movies like the music biopic parody Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story have flickered with intermittent hilarity nothing hes done since Zero Effect (which Kasdan also wrote) has felt as weird or indelible. Certainly not this. Sex Tape sports an appealingly judgment-free message about porn and its role in committed relationships and features a couple of welcome late-arriving cameos to help drive it home. And its stuffed with more comic talent than it knows how to use Rob Corddry amp; Ellie Kemper have time to register as Jay and Annies best friends but Nat Faxon and Kumail Nanjiani are both in the movie for maybe 60 seconds. But the flicks biggest boner-killer is its relentless shilling for Apple and -- really -- the amateur-adult-video-sharing site YouPorn.""I buy them two at a time"" Jay says when his assistant or somebody hands him two still-shrink-wrapped iPads.Later he praises the resolution of the iPads camera.Still later he marvels how easy it is to sync his data among his various Apple devices (including crucially the ones hes forgotten he gave away). Eventually a blackmail-minded 12-year-old will point out that wiping them remotely of all data is a cinch too -- not that a doddering senile 34-year-old like Jay could be expected to know that.But at least hes speaking to another character in that scene. Theres also a moment when he picks up one of these miracle devices after falling out of a window with it and blurts to no one ""The construction on these things is incredible""Now it can be told Sex Tape is the product placement-iest film in recent memory that isnt about giant robots trashing Chicago and part of Detroit made up to look like Hong Kong. The movie gets points for casting 41-year-old Diaz as the spouse of 34-year-old Segel; good riddance to the days when every 48-year-old male lead seemed to have a 25-year-old wife. And their nudity is rationed with admirable parity. Diaz looks amazing for 41 or for 21 and Segel -- who heroically showed us his flaccid junk in Forgetting Sarah Marshall -- is as stretched out and pale and soft and smooth as ever. Good for him. Hes a genuine and versatile comic talent and if he ever did a set of crunches his innate funniness would instantly drop by half. (Hell next play David Foster Wallace. This should probably be a footnote instead of a parenthetical aside.)After that wobbly second act Sex Tape finally does reward us in its last moments with a speed-through of its titular MacGuffin wherein Annie and Jay gamely attempt to execute every single position featured in The Joy of Sex -- possibly the only old-timey paper book in their home. The sequence is euphorically shamelessly goofy two consenting adults hurling their no-longer-invulnerable bodies at one another like 10-year-olds doing cannonballs on the first day of summer vacation -- and then taking turns holding an ice pack on their bruised genitals. In this sequence Sex Tape finally looks like the truly superfreaky comedy Kasdan and Diaz and Segel have within them. If only Sex Tape were as good as their Sex Tape.

In those retroactively even-weirder movies Doris and Rock often had to find ways to put the spice back into their marriage. The couple in this one has the same problem (kids jobs and watching a baby ""crown"" can all indeed put a damper on ones libido) but their solution wasnt available 50 years ago They use their iPad to photograph three hours of fumbling but ultimately satisfying attempts to execute every position inA The Joy of Sex. If it sounds kinky well apart from Diazs long stems and Segels newly slim physique the film is only sexy by the vanilla standards of the American multiplex; at heart its about as naughty as an old Disney movie with Dean Jones Suzanne Pleshette and an unruly Great Dane. I liked its gung-ho slapstick spirit though. No ones slacking off. The bulk of the movie (expertly orchestrated by director Jake Kasdan) centers on Cameron and Jasons attempt to prevent the tape -- which was automatically saved to ""the cloud"" as well as various old iPads that Segels character has given away -- from internet distribution. This would seem more urgent if Sex Tape didnt open with mommy-blogger Cameron reading an entry in which she details the ways in which her and Segels characters used to hump each other all the time in public. Farce thrives on a backdrop of repression and given their exhibitionistic past (and Diazs evident comfort appearing in her undies) the stakes arent as high as if the couple were say Amish. But I suppose thats what makes it au courant. These days even the Mennonites let it all hang out on Facebook. Diaz and Segel get a good tag-team rhythm going. Attempting to recover the iPads theyve passed on to friends and acquaintances they dither blurt out stupid things and then freeze amazed at their own ineptitude. Diaz pulls a lot of faces but I find the combination of that clown mouth and Barbie body hard to resist. Shes a natural dizzy dame. Rob Corddy and the adorable Ellie Kemper are sweetly ingenuous as the lead couples infant-Bjorning friends. Rob Lowe is not the first actor who springs to mind for the role of the nerdy bespectacled Jewish owner of a toy company who wants to acquire her blogging services (and to convince her later that hes one groovy guy) but hes in there working hard and getting big laughs. Lowe was once the unfortunate P.R. victim of a runaway sex video so this (along with his two volumes of memoir) must be part of a campaign to reclaim his past. Second acts in American pop-culture are rarely so entertainingly self-effacing. In the last act Diaz and Segel enlist their two young children in an act of espionage thus tugging Sex Tape firmly into the realm of a family picture. Im sad that we dont have a real dirty-movie culture for grown-ups in this country but its nice that on some astral plane Rob and Laura Petrie are celebrating the fact that their descendants can read aloud from The Joy of Sex and dont have to sleep in twin beds.

"Sex Tape | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sex-tape ) Sex Tape (United States 2014) July 17 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Two fundamental problems afflict Sex Tape (aside from the fact that its not consistently funny) a shocking ignorance about the state of modern technology and a mistaken belief that the subject matter is inherently edgy. The screenplay is disappointing on a number of levels. The humor is sophomoric relying on slapstick while ignoring potentially ribald possibilities that could arise from the situation. And the films attempts to build characters and relationships are undercooked. Yes there are some laughs but theyre not as big or as frequent as one might expect from a would-be ""major"" comedy. The premise in and of itself is outdated. The idea of a home-made sex tape being considered ""naughty"" is at least a decade old. Nowadays a lot of young couples are making these for their personal (and sometimes non-personal) use - a fact acknowledged during Sex Tapes bizarre climactic sequence - so the movies attitude toward this is out-of-step with contemporary reality. The contrivance necessary to allow the tape to be distributed is insulting to anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of how technology works. It feels artificial. The filmmakers apparently aware of this attempt to shoehorn in an explanation but it only calls attention to how absurd the situation is. The events of Sex Tape not only make leading man Jay (Jason Segel) come across as an unsympathetic moron but they insult the intelligence of even moderately technologically savvy viewers. Sex Tape begins with a situation of increasing familiarity in movies (as they attempt to reflect reality) a married couple bemoaning their lack of a sex life. Annie (Cameron Diaz) and Jay are happy in just about every way that counts except between the sheets. Kids and career demands have killed their opportunities for intimacy. So to spice things up they pack up the offspring for a night at grandmas and decide to try out every position in the once-popular sex manual The Joy of Sex. To add fuel to the fire Annie suggests they make a sex tape with the condition that it be erased the next day. Jay unwilling to delete the concrete record of ""one of the best nights of [his] life"" accidentally uploads it to a fleet of iPads he has given out to friends family and the mailman. Supposed hilarity ensues as the couple attempts to retrieve the iPads and prevent the video from being uploaded to the porn site YouPorn. Some of the early material in Sex Tape although perhaps too reminiscent of the beginning of the much funnier Neighbors works. The details about Annie and Jays lack of sexual intimacy rings true and theres something playful about the way in which they attempt to recapture it. The movies narrative enters a sharp downward spiral when it comes time to start rounding up the iPads. This includes a cartoonish and excruciatingly protracted scene with Annie and Jay visiting a mansion owned by Annies boss Hank (played by a nebbish Rob Lowe). While Annie does cocaine and flirts with Hank Jay prowls the house looking for the iPad and being chased by a dog. The films final fifteen minutes are if anything even worse despite an on-target performance by a familiar (but uncredited) actor. Sex Tape isnt without its share of funny moments but they are too few and far between to justify even the slim 90-minute running length. Those on the lookout for a little skin which one might logically expect from a movie with this title may also be disappointed. The nudity is for the most part of the peek-a-boo variety. There are some rear shots (of both Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel) but nothing more explicit. Its borderline-PG-13 and the lack of candor with respect to the sex scenes is one of the reasons why Sex Tape feels tepid. A movie of this sort should be racy and edgy; it should stoke the libido and tickle the funny bone. This one does neither and as a result feels like a cheat.

Sex Tape is a dull tone deaf comedy and not the least bit sexy review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSex Tape is a dull tone deaf comedy and not the least bit sexy review Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel star as marrieds looking to get some heat back between the sheets by making a sex video.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. July 17 2014Sex TapeStarring Cameron Diaz Jason Segel Rob Lowe Ellie Kemper and Rob Corddry. Directed by Jake Kasdan. 95 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. 14AJust lie back and think of funnier films.Sex Tape reunites Bad Teacher stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel as marrieds Annie and Jay who are looking to get some heat back between the sheets. They make a sex video and then spend the rest of the movie trying to keep anyone from seeing it.Article Continued BelowBack in college they were at it like rabbits. Now with a couple of kids (Sebastian Hedges Thomas and Giselle Eisenberg) and first-world burdens like Annie trying to sell her mommy blog nibbling away at libido theyre too stressed and tired to hop to it like they once did.Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz play a couple of boring-married types trying to spice up their waning sex life.Inspired by their new iPad (one of a scandalous number of product placements for Apple products along with a free ad for real-life user-submitted site YouPorn) Annie hits on making a sex video. Theyll use 42-year-old manual The Joy of Sex as a guide going at it Julie amp; Julia style page by page.If youre seeking titillation you wont find it here among the comic flailings and body slamming that resembles a sloshing tub of squid more than erotica. But it is good-looking squid thanks to Diazs perky posterior and the newly trim Segel.Frustratingly director Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher) along with screenwriters Kate Angelo Segel and Nicholas Stoller (who teamed with Segel to pen The Muppets) seem unsure what kind of movie they want to make.The confusion shows up onscreen in a sitcom-style effort that has a few funny lines (theres a good Siri zinger) and even less sex or examination of the humiliating repercussions of a homemade porno spilling into the world. That spillage happens to Annie and Jay thanks to a syncing app hes installed for music and a wrinkle in the Cloud that downloads their romp onto all of his used iPads that he has generously gifted to everyone from her parents to the mailman.Its a plot device thats been pretty much debunked but points for trying to update the old stealth emails trope.Friends Tess (Bridesmaids Ellie Kemper) and Robby (Rob Corddry of Hot Tub Time Machine) offer to help gather the iPads including one that has landed in the hands of Hank the toy company exec Annie hopes to work for. Hes played by Rob Lowe who knows a thing or two about sex tapes.The mission through Hanks mansion is pure slapstick as Annie discovers the freaky side of her possible boss while Jay hunts for the device and deals with a determined German shepherd while getting to make an epilepsy joke.A final assemblage involving Jack Black pit bulls and a roomful of computer servers doesnt fit in at all. Ditto a dumb final encounter with a larcenous preteen. And as for the mailman who is teased over and over its a joke with no payoff forgotten in the mayhem.Its been done before -- and perhaps slightly better by Kevin Smith as Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Smith at least wasnt afraid to let his freak flag fly in taking on a sexy subject even if it was often painful to watch.Its disheartening to see such lacklustre work from actors who are capable of much better. Diaz is a fine comic actress (Theres Something about Mary) and Segel has a lovely loopy everyman way about him (I Love You Man The Muppets). Its all wasted here.As for Sex Tape not tonight dear.

"Review Sex Tape lacks appeal even with Jason Segel Cameron Diaz - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Sex Tape lacks appeal even with Jason Segel Cameron Diaz Sex Tape Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Sex Tape starring Jason Segel Cameron Diaz Jack Black Rob Corddry and Rob Lowe. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews Sex Tape starring Jason Segel Cameron Diaz Jack Black Rob Corddry and Rob Lowe. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Sex Tape has Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz and lots of raunch but little sex appeal Lets start with the bare facts. A big-screen shot of a naked handstand is an overshare any way you look at it of parts and places better left unexposed -- even from the back even in a raunchy sex comedy titled ""Sex Tape"" even when executed by Jason Segel like costar Cameron Diaz a very appealing actor dressed or not.Next a word about ""F-bombs."" A fairly liberal use in R-rated fare is expected but ""Sex Tape"" must be going for a Guinness world record. Onto the iPad issue. ""Sex Tape"" seems intent on exposing as many of Apples is as those aforementioned nether regions. There is even an iPad plot point. So if Apple didnt cover the cost of Kate Angelo Nicholas Stoller and Segels script it should write the check now.Finally and this is the killer given all of the skin its stars show rarely has sex been less sexy. Some of the unsexy in ""Sex Tape"" is intentional. Think of it as the ""artistic"" distinction between homemade porn and actual porn that a porn entrepreneur played persuasively by an uncredited Jack Black might make. But consider ""Sex Tapes"" opening sequence which captures Annie (Diaz) and Jay (Segel) in college in the first throes. The sex is nonstop and all over the place. Funny? Occasionally. But super sexy? Nope.Ten years later Annie and Jay are married with two kids still in love but no longer in lust as Annie writes in her mommy blog which also serves as narration for some of what we see.Now two things need to be established so that the sex tape in the cloud can present a problem big enough to drive all the slapstick comedy that follows. One is Jays specialty. A music guy of some sort he makes great mix tapes which he shares with friends via his iPad. Jay may use technology but he does not understand it. This and a send button will make that plain. Related Cameron Diaz and Jason Segels Sex Tape doesnt arouse critics Oliver Gettell As far as titles go ""Sex Tape"" is a titillating one. But despite its naughty potential the new R-rated comedy ? starring Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz as a couple whose plan to spice up their marriage goes badly awry ? has movie critics feeling frigid. As far as titles go ""Sex Tape"" is a titillating one. But despite its naughty potential the new R-rated comedy ? starring Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz as a couple whose plan to spice up their marriage goes badly awry ? has movie critics feeling frigid. (Oliver Gettell) Meanwhile Annies blog has attracted the interest of a giant toy company. Run by a prissy Hank Rosenbaum played by a simpering scene-stealing Rob Lowe Piper Brothers is interested in acquiring the blog and Annies funny take on parenthood. Cleaned up of course.Jay is finishing up a new mix tape. Annies about to nail the new job. Both want to reclaim their earlier ecstatic sexual state before its too late. Enter the sex tape.With the kids safely at Grandmas they try. And they try. After a few false starts -- in roller skates on the kitchen floor -- an impromptu video session with an old copy of ""The Joy of Sex"" for inspiration seems to do the trick. Guess which product they choose to tape their three hours of sex?This is the point when the film directed with a somewhat lively touch by Jake Kasdan starts to have some interesting things to say about modern marriage sexuality technology and how to keep the flame burning. But like Jay Kasdan has difficulty keeping it up. (He also directed Diaz and Segel in the barely passable ""Bad Teacher."")Since its a comedy much could be forgiven if the film was consistent in generating laughs but the comedy is as erratic as the couples sex life.There are certainly classic moments. Some involve best friends Robby (Rob Corddry) and Tess (Ellie Kemper). They were on Jays ""send"" list but their son Howard (a wry Harrison Holzer) is the one who discovers the video and is now trying to blackmail Jay.Most of the films funniest stuff involves a house call the couple make to retrieve one of the offending iPads -- a gift from Annie to Piper Brothers Hank.The making of said tape definitely showcases the stars facility with physical comedy. Theres Segel with his handstand Diaz doing a forward flip both of them naked and entangled in increasingly awkward ways as they try to measure up to ""The Joy of Sex"" instructions.But the trip to Hanks house allows Diaz in particular to go comedy crazy.Annies main job is to keep Hank distracted while Jay searches for the offending iPad and between Diazs fearless flailing and Lowes flawless manipulation of his manipulative character the best moments in the movie happen under that roof. A shout-out to production designer Jefferson Sage for making Hanks home so weirdly surreal as to be laughable.Diaz and Segel are very good at relationship comedy; theyve proved that in countless films. Both of the actors have a kind of silly sweetness underpinning their antics which in ""Sex Tape"" helps soften the R-rated blows.The stars do expose their sensitive side along with a lot of skin. Still the most thoughtful relationship advice comes from the porn mogul. Now that is funny.Twitter BetsySharkey-------------------------Sex TapeMPAA rating R for strong sexual content nudity language and some drug useRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Column Reviews Cameron Diaz Apple iPad Jason Segel Sex Tape Sex Tape Purge and Planes take on Planet of the Apes Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-sex-tape-review-20140718-column.html,200,sextape11,sextape,latimes

AP Sony Pictures AP AP Sex Tape   Director Jake Kasdan Cast Jason Segel Cameron Diaz Rated R (strong sexual content nudity strong language some drug use) Running time 94 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 415pm on Thursday Jul. 17 2014 Thursday Jul. 17 2014 Friday Jul. 18 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram It must have sounded sidesplitting on paper.There would be Jason Segel doing his goofy-guy-with-a-heart-of-gold thing Cameron Diaz (sort of) in Bad Teacher/Theres Something About Mary mode and a Noahs flood worth of comedic co-stars like Rob Corddry Jack Black Rob Lowe Ellie Kemper and Nat Faxon.Throw in a director Jake Kasdan known for Bad Teacher and being part of the team that worked on the cult TV show Freaks and Geeks a script co-written by Segel with Nicholas Stoller ( Muppets Most Wanted The Five-Year Engagement) and a buzz-worthy name -- heck it will even have the word ""sex"" in the title -- and thats one Hollywood lunch that probably ended with high-fives all around.Too bad then that the resulting movie Sex Tape is about as funny as a funeral.Its not for lack of trying. Segel and Diaz give it their all -- and pretty much show their all too -- but enthusiasm alone isnt enough when the writing is as lazy as Homer Simpson at a hammock factory. Sex Tape starts off with Annie (Diaz) writing her mommy blog about remembering when she and hubbie Jay (Segel) before kids came along would have sex anywhere and everywhere. (You know the movie is seriously out of touch when the flashback of Annie and Jay presumably not that many years ago since their oldest is only in fourth grade are shown exchanging mix-tape cassettes. What year is this supposed to be? 1985?)In order to spice things up they decide to make their own porn using one of Jays many iPads. In fact he has so many iPads that he doles them out as gifts to friends and even the mailman. (Really? Who does this? Obviously Im on the wrong Christmas list.)Annie asks him to delete the movie but Jay unwittingly ends up uploading it to that pesky little thing known as the cloud. So everyone who has one of his iPads ends up getting another nice little gift from Jay this one involving Jay and Annie in their birthday suits doing all sorts of athletic stunts inspired by their old copy of The Joy of Sex. And one of their ""friends"" who has seen the film is taunting them with text messages and even threatens to load the whole thing onto a YouTube-like porn site.So Jay and Annie are on a mission to get all the iPads back.Comedy doesnt necessarily have to be plausible to be funny and Sex Tape could have used the premise as a launch pad for a wry ribald look at relationships or at least as an excuse for some riotous physical humor. Yet theres little of either. Most of it is either labored to the point of exhaustion (Jay being chased around a house by a vicious dog) or not that humorous in the first place. Its not even tasteless enough to be obnoxiously memorable. Everything about it is pedestrian.There are a few chuckle-worthy moments Lowe as the uptight CEO of the company that wants to buy Annies blog -- who turns out to be not so uptight after all; and Harrison Holzer as the two-faced son of their friends (the friends are played by Corddry and Kemper).But its too little too late in a movie that while only 94 minutes feels too long.The real sex tape that Jay and Annie are chasing all over town might have at least had some instructive value. The movie Sex Tape that Jason and Cameron have made cant even make that claim. Cary Darling 817 390-7571 Twitter Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Sex Tape"" is a lump of half-cocked misunderstandings and nakedly affected zaniness. Theres not much to this pratfalling exercise in futility that we havent seen before except for a flash of Cameron Diazs bare rump. And that is hardly an experience worth 100 minutes of your one and only life. The film appears to have been written backward title first then a wet string of comic situations and one-liners story last. Diaz and Jason Segel play Annie and Jay college sweethearts in a monotonous marriage. She mommy-blogs he is a music executive. Sensual ecstasy is a dim memory. To revive their relationship she suggests starring in their own private porn video. Before you can say ""viral"" their featurette migrates to a handful of matching iPads that Segel has given as gifts to friends auto-synched to his ever-changing music collection. Aghast the duo race to retrieve the devices before anyone has a chance to click Play. At this point we are forced to draw several conclusions. First Annie and Jay must have attended Duh University. Second Diaz who turns 42 in August is simply not credible as a woman 10 years out of college. Third director Jake Kasdan has zero feel for the cadence and rhythm of sex farce. The scenes that should be steamy or silly are merely squirmy. The story proceeds as if it lost its driving directions. Annies blog is about to be bought by a wholesome baby-products company. Since Annie has given the firms boss another of Jays linked iPads the pair must fast-talk their way into his house and steal it back. The film becomes a caper comedy that does not caper comically. Rob Lowes appearance as Annies prospective boss adds a weird metatextual dimension. In 1988 Lowe was one of the first screen performers to be embarrassed by the release of a sex tape. He tried to spoof his bad-boy image at the next Oscars telecast by waltzing with an actress dressed as Walt Disneys wholesome Snow White a stunt considered a historic PR misfire. Here he plays a squeaky-clean corporate honcho with a few kinky secrets and a fetish for Disney characters. This makes no less sense than the rest of the film. SEX TAPE 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for strong sexual content nudity language and some drug use. Diaz delivers a face-scrunching performance that would have the patrons of a dinner theater rattling their silverware in annoyance. Segel whose comic chemistry with Amy Adams was enchanting in ""The Muppet Movie"" seems adrift in these slackly staged proceedings self-conscious and staring vacantly into the eyes of his leading lady. The dialogue (which he co-wrote) is a grab bag of balky phrases screaming to be polished into better jokes. ""Sex Tape"" apes its frustrated protagonists limply yearning for thrills it cant achieve. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Photo/Video Sony) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com July 17 2014 243 p.m. ET 1 COMMENTS Instead of soft core ""Sex Tape"" offers no core. No narrative core just a not-bad notion executed execrably; no core of conviction just two stars trudging joylessly through swamps of mediocrity. Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel last played together in the smarmy ""Bad Teacher"" which was directed with uncommon coarseness by Jake Kasdan. Now the three are back in an almost mirthless farce about a husband and wife who memorialize themselves having sex then frantically seek to retrieve the evidence when it threatens to go viral. More Reviews I Origins Mood Indigo This may not be the death of comedy but its certainly a prime exhibit in a summer season when many ostensibly sure-fire films are misfiring. Ms. Diazs Annie and Mr. Segels Jay make their video on a new iPad in an effort to restore passion to their marriage. Its a human thing to do even though their homespun performance lasts for a superhuman three hours ""Thats the length of the movie Lincoln"" a friend observes admiringly. Yet theres a deficit of humanity between them whether theyre thrashing in the throes--we finally get to see a few throes which are more dogged than provocative--or chasing down iPads that theyd given to friends as gifts. (In the scripts labored Apple-flavored techno-logic Jay has uploaded the video to the cloud instead of deleting it then sent it inadvertently to those other iPads along with synced music.) In the interest of full disclosure I did laugh out loud at one gag that unlike almost everything else in the movie has nothing to do with sex. ""Siri how do you perform CPR on a dog?"" Jay asks his phone urgently. ""I found four places named Starbucks"" Siri replies. Rewind DVD //Streaming //Download ENLARGE In Her Shoes (2005) This film is a vivid reminder of Cameron Diazs talent so sadly squandered in ""Sex Tape."" She plays sexy sluttish Maggie whose life is in ruins. Toni Collette is Rose Maggies older plain-Jane sister a prosperous lawyer whos always there to pick up the pieces. The film directed by Curtis Hanson is manipulative but affecting. Nothing in Ms. Diazs career foreshadowed this beautiful performance. Her Maggie is a vivid creature a perpetually adolescent party girl coming slowly to understand that the partys over. Susannah Grant adapted the screenplay from Jennifer Weiners novel.

Photo Credit AP / Claire Folger advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An adventurous husband and wife discover that their private video is about to go viral. Rated R (strong sexual content nudity language and some drug use) BOTTOM LINE Basically an R-rated sitcom episode though the humor is surprisingly tame given the topic. CAST Jason Segel Cameron Diaz Rob Corddry Rob Lowe LENGTH 134 Why do people make sex tapes anyway? A souvenir? Future reference? Is it just one of those kitschy fetishes like mirrors on the ceiling? For Jay and Annie (Jason Segel Cameron Diaz) in Jake Kasdans mildly spicy comedy ""Sex Tape"" its a way to reignite their erotic fire. The days of quickies in the college library are gone replaced by the demands of marriage work and children. ""The last time was after we bought those towels at Bed Bath amp; Beyond"" Jay says wistfully. But with the kids safely at grandmas one night Jay and Annie seize the moment. Armed with an iPad and ""The Joy of Sex"" they document a three-hour gymnastic marathon that leaves them exhausted a little embarrassed and -- for the first time in a while -- extremely happy. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? This first third of ""Sex Tape"" is funny intimate and rather sweet thanks largely to Diaz. Her Annie is a rare bird in the movies a normal woman with a strong sexual appetite. (Kate Angelo of ""The Back-up Plan"" wrote the script.) Annie is neither femme fatale nor tragic tramp but a loving wife and mother with an adventurous side. In fact the sex tape is entirely her idea. Segels Jay is blandly likable but Diaz -- with and without her clothes -- gives Annie a bouncy zesty energy. When the plot finally begins it feels like an (ahem) anticlimax. Thanks to a syncing mistake that any Apple user will find convincing the video is circulating around town on several iPads and perhaps even -- oh God -- on the Internet. Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper play the couples semi-helpful best friends while Annies seemingly wholesome boss Hank Rosenbaum is played by Rob Lowe gamely satirizing his checkered past (though steering clear of his own famous sex tape from 1988). MoviesSummers must-see movies Given its subject matter and R rating ""Sex Tape"" isnt as wild or woolly as it could be.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 829 p.m. EDT July 17 2014Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz star in the new comedy Sex Tape.(Photo Claire Folger Columbia Pictures)For those with a voyeuristic desire to gaze upon Cameron Diazs well-toned body or Jason Segels slimmed-down physique such glimpses might be worth the price of admission to Sex Tape. But viewers seeking a fresh comedy a seductive romp or even just an escape from boredom for a couple hours will be left dismally unsatisfied by this stilted nearly humorless non-titillating slog ( 1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide).The booty shots are there; if only the laughs in this tone-deaf comedy surfaced as often.When a strained story relies heavily on high concept it better have something else to bolster it. Even a movie based around a homemade porno and a pair of rom-com stalwarts still needs a clever script.USA TODAYReporter diary Behind the obvious question at the premiere of Sex TapeUSA TODAYThe latest movie reviewsWhile the kids are at their grandmothers house married couple Annie (Diaz) and Jay (Segel) decide to re-enact The Joy of Sex in a three-hour marathon session recording it for their viewing pleasure. Intended for their eyes only it ends up inadvertently finding its way onto the Cloud. The concept would seem to have comic potential but it comes across as the eye-roll-inducing punch line to a mildly dirty joke.Jay works in radio and gives away iPads with his compiled music lists to pretty much anyone who will listen. Guess whats also on those iPads? The couples amorous adventures are there for all to peruse suddenly downloadable by everyone from the mailman to -- whoops -- their closest friends (Ellie Kemper and Rob Corddry).Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A married couple goes to extraordinary lengths to recover a sex tape that winds in all the wrong hands. Sex Tape stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel. (Trailer edited for content.) VPCSo Annie and Jay decide to run around and grab back those tablets.With all its references to iPads and the Cloud the film feels as if it were financed by Apple. Speaking of which anyone whos relatively tech-savvy will know that their problem has a rather simple fix.The only truly funny segment involves Rob Lowe as Hank Annies potential new employer. Annie realizes she gave Hank -- who runs a company big on traditional family values -- one of the iPads. So she and Jay decide to find a way into his mansion to retrieve the device. While Jay is chased around by a German shepherd Annie tries to distract the eccentric Hank who has paintings of himself as Disney characters all around his home. Scenes with Lowe -- once famous for his own sex tape -- send up his former bad-boy image and enliven the movie.In the opening scenes Diaz and Segel play their randy college selves which is a stretch given that Diaz is 41 and Segel is 34.

"Sex Tape starring Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Sex Tape The First and Likely Last Comedy About the Cloud Sex Tape The First and Likely Last Comedy About the Cloud Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 17 2014 330 PM Sex Tape The sex tape in Sex Tape seems much more entertaining than Sex Tape. By Dana Stevens Annie (Cameron Diaz) and Jay (Jason Segel) in Sex Tape. Courtesy of Claire Folger/Sony Pictures The three-hour-long homemade porn video that Jay and Annie (Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz) inadvertently upload to the cloud in Jake Kasdans Sex Tape looks like a much better movie than Sex Tape (which runs thankfully only 94 minutes). Jay and Annies film which they decide to make on a whim one night in an attempt to jump-start their near-sexless decadelong marriage includes some bold cinematographic choices Though we first see Jay setting up a stationary iPad to record the action later shots appear to be framed from varying close-up angles suggesting either the presence of a third-party camera operator or some world-class selfie-framing. And those moments we do glimpse from the couples magnum opus--an epic re-enactment of the entire Joy of Sex catalog of sexual positions--seem spontaneous unpredictable and funny. In a scene that represents Sex Tapes road not taken Jay enacts his long-unfulfilled fantasy of singing ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" in an old-timey Al Jolson warble while wearing only an Egyptian-style loincloth. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Sex Tape conversely is as timid bland and predictable as romantic comedies come--though its a hard movie to hate entirely whether because of its game and likeable co-stars or because the script (by Segel his Forgetting Sarah Marshall collaborator Nicholas Stoller and Kate Angelo) just keeps trying so doggedly to sell its preposterous--and apparently technologically impossible--comic premise. You see Jay is a radio DJ--at least Im fairly sure thats what he does since his job involves attending lots of music shows occasionally shooting the bull with friends in what appears to be a sound studio and putting lots and lots of music playlists on iPads. This movie is awash in iPads no doubt both for product placement reasons (""These things are so durable"" marvels Jay picking up a dropped tablet) and because the simultaneous syncing of multiple iPads via a fictional app called Frankensync is essential to putting the suspense plot (such as it is) in motion. After Jay and Annies sex tape accidentally uploads--not to the Web mind you but to this far-flung network of interconnected iPads that Jay has loaded with music to give out to friends and family--they set out on a madcap-yet-boring mission to secure all the tablets in question and erase the video before anyone sees it. But at least one person already has--a mystery troll whos anonymously texting Jay with implicit threats to put the whole thing online. Memo to Hollywood I dont mind my Segels Rogens and Pratts with a little more meat on their bones. Advertisement On their nocturnal iPad-seizing journey through L.A. Jay and Annie acquire a pair of co-conspirators their old friends Robby and Tess (Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper both underused) and eventually cross paths with a wisdom-dispensing Web porn mogul played by an uncredited and quite funny Jack Black. But their top priority is to infiltrate the home of Hank Rosenbaum (Rob Lowe) the CEO of a wholesome toy company thats about to acquire Annies parenting blog (writing mommy blogs and baking cupcakes being among the fastest-growing fields for entrepreneurial rom-com heroines). In a long sequence at his mansion the cardigan-clad apparently placid Hank reveals himself to be a party animal with a taste for gangsta rap and cocaine which he peer-pressures Annie into snorting with him while Jay combs the house for the iPad pursued by a crazed German shepherd. This clumsily cross-cut sequence goes on for far too long but Lowe (a real-life veteran of a sex-tape scandal) is genuinely funny as the needy unpredictable Hank. Lowe has a knack for creating memorably off-kilter supporting characters (like Liberaces immobile-faced plastic surgeon in Behind the Candelabra) and he and Diaz manage to capture and skewer the faux-intimate bonding of two near-strangers doing drugs together. This is the second time Kasdan has paired up Diaz and Segel in a mildly racy romantic comedy--the first was 2011s Bad Teacher--and though neither movie floated my boat I wouldnt mind seeing these two play a couple again. They have a similar comic energy--both are tall ungainly over-earnest nerds--and theyre believable both as the long-married parents of two rarely seen kids and (in flashbacks) as a pair of sex-crazed college lovebirds. The usually schleppy (and always-up-for-baring-it-all) Segel has been slimmed down and gym-buffed to within an inch of his life no doubt in order to make him a plausibly attractive mate for the always-lissome Ms. Diaz. He looks handsome if a little gaunt around the face but a part of me was sad to see a male star subjected to the same pitiless beautification gauntlet actresses are routinely sentenced to endure. Memo to Hollywood Heres one viewer who doesnt mind her Segels Rogens and Pratts with a little more meat on their bones. Sex Tape seems aimed at the same imaginary demographic to which its characters belong people in their 30s who somehow a) own Joy of Sex in paperback; b) make it a habit to routinely acquire and discard iPads yet have no concept of how to remotely erase one; and c) work in tech-related fields (online writing radio production) yet fly into a panic at the mere concept of ""the cloud."" (Full disclosure I dont really get the cloud myself.) In a not-far-off Internet future Sex Tape will be seen less as a comedy about a loving couple resparking their physical intimacy through shared misadventure than as a satire about technologically clueless clods who still think information resides on individual devices. That is if this movie gets rewatched at all--a prospect which like accidentally posting your three-hour sex tutorial to the Internet seems both ill-advised and unlikely.

Sex Tape (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Sex Tape (R) This comedy about a couples leaked sex tape is as funny as an STD. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com7/17/2014 Editor rating 1.5 The cinematic equivalent of herpes Sex Tape is an uncomfortable embarrassment to raunchy comedies everywhere. Fortunately no medication is required after being exposed to it The effects are not permanent only painful. Heres the weird thing Two of the movies three writers (Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller) have collaborated on a couple of good movies (The Five-Year Engagement The Muppets). Segel also wrote the even funnier Forgetting Sarah Marshall while Stoller directed. Where did things go so horribly wrong with Sex Tape? Did the infection stem from the inclusion of writer No. 3 Kate Angelo responsible for the dreadful J-Lo movie The Back Up Plan? Hard to say. Sex Tapes basic premise is solid Married couple Annie and Jay try to jump-start their sex life by making a pornographic video that inadvertently ends up on the iPads of friends and family (the movie is basically Apples worst ad ever). Stars Segel and Cameron Diaz (whose last adult comedy The Other Woman was one of springs most unexpected surprises) have made reliably funny movies in the past. Even the supporting cast -- which includes Rob Lowe as the outwardly clean-cut CEO who wants to hire Annie as a sort of spokesperson for his family-oriented company -- is more than capable of producing laughs. But everything about Sex Tape feels off the comic timing; the pacing; the jokes; the fact that Diaz and Segel play their college-age selves. Even the editing is choppy the explanations of how the video got synced to everyone elses iPad clumsy and repetitive. The result is a movie that feels thrown together haphazardly. Director Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story) seems to have assumed that the subject matter is enough to make the audience laugh and hes wrong. There are a few amusing sight gags involving Segel and a German shepherd (animal lovers may disagree) but almost every other joke is a retread. The movie even throws in the overused lets-do-coke-and-get-all-crazy-and-talk-fast scene a sure sign of desperation. Segel and Diaz are game for anything -- both of them have nude scenes and Segel even manages a graceful if startling naked headstand -- and at the films end when the audience finally gets a glimpse of the sex tape in question a few horrified laughs may erupt. But at that point its too little and too late to get worked up over a movie thats not even half as crude rude and funny as it could have been. Cast Cameron Diaz Jason Segel Rob Lowe Rob Corddry Ellie Kemper. Director Jake Kasdan. Screenwriters Kate Angelo Jason Segel Nicholas Stoller. A Sony Pictures release. Running time 90 minutes.

Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews the Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz vehicle ""Sex Tape."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Like ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" Jake Kasdans ""Sex Tape"" is a grim cautionary fable about the evils of technology in this case pitting its desperate protagonists against an unseen force people refer to as ""the cloud.""Unlike ""2001"" its also a stupid strenuous sex farce starring Cameron Diaz Diazs dorsal-view body double and Jason Segel as an LA couple (shes a mommy blogger hes in radio) with two kids an increasingly groggy romantic life and a provocative solution to their current coital slump Make a sex tape The results a three-hour epic re-enacting of the entire ""Joy of Sex"" reference book wind up sliding onto a batch of iPads that Jay (Segel uncharacteristically forcing every joke such as they are) has recently given away for reasons very very poorly set up by the script. Its ""uh-oh"" time when Annie played by Diaz hands her own porn-infected iPad to a rich Brentwood CEO (Rob Lowe who had his own sex-tape issues once upon a time) interested in buying her blog for a handsome fee.Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper are the central couples married friends aiding Jay and Annie in their frantic retrieval of the iPads synced up (again a lot of horsy unconvincing explanation here) with Jays own iPad the one we keep hearing about with all its fantastic high-res clarity. ""Sex Tape"" is so in the bag for Apple and its products its practically a product-placement love story. Why does this movie flail when recent R-rated commodities such as ""Neighbors"" (directed by Nicholas Stoller one of the writers on ""Sex Tape"" along with Segel and Kate Angelo) have found a way to deal with the challenges of marriage and parenthood and temptation in a clever way? Partly its because ""Sex Tape"" settles for violence when violent slapstick a lot harder to finesse was the implicit goal of the picture.The centerpiece sequence has Annie doing cocaine with the weaselly Lowe character while Jay battles the CEOs murderous guard dog elsewhere in the mansion. Director Kasdan a middling talent at best with this sort of material chops the action into clunky bug-eyed close-ups or flatly staged medium shots. Early on theres a long bit where Jay nervous about the prospect of having sex with his wife after a little too much time has elapsed has trouble untying Annies double-knotted roller skates. You wait for the scene to get going or pay off or something. Instead its just awkward. The whole movies like that.If ""Sex Tape"" ends up making money itll be strictly on the backs of its valiant performers who surely sensed the weakness of the script and decided to go at it like a job like turning an acting trick finesse and pacing be damned. Six years ago Kevin Smiths ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" was funnier sharper and more interesting in its central relationship. But that was in the pre-cloud days when dinosaurs ruled the Earth before movies like ""Sex Tape"" took for granted (or pushed the idea) that everybodys into porn these days all the time like breathing. Everybody. All the time. Segel and Diaz have their comic charm but its stretched thin here to the breaking point.""Sex Tape"" - 1 1/2 stars MPAA rating R (for strong sexual content nudity language and some drug use)Running time 134Opens Fridaymjphillipstribune.com Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Computer Hardware Cameron Diaz Apple iPad Jake Kasdan Jason Segel Ellie Kemper Latest movie reviews Review Boyhood  Review Wish I Was Here  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-sex-tape-review-20140717,0,4746327.column",200,sextape20,sextape,chicagotribune

Annie (Cameron Diaz) and Jay (Jason Segel) watch their video online in Columbia Pictures SEX TAPE. Photo Claire Folger Sony Pictures Releasing Sex Tape review Clever setup fails to reach climax 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Sex Tape Comedy. Starring Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz. Directed by Jake Kasdan. (R. 90 minutes.) ""Sex Tape"" has its share of laughs but its not the hilarious romp that the trailers seemed to promise. About a third of it is a brilliant setup - but its for a joke that never happens at least not completely. A comedy especially a broad sex comedy needs to go to extremes. But ""Sex Tape"" is a little careful and contained. If you know anything about the movie you know that this is the one with Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz as a husband and wife who make a sex tape - and accidentally disseminate it via the cloud to everyone they know. But thats not exactly how the story goes. Actually the recording is sent only to a handful of people who are on the husbands network. And most of the action consists of the couple driving around over the course of a long night trying to retrieve some iPads before friends notice the recording and watch it. The movie is at its best - and this should not be the case - before the recording is made. Jay (Segel) and Annie (Diaz) were once passionate about each other but now after two kids their sex life has become the victim of exhaustion and busy work schedules. When they finally get the kids off to Grandmas house and have a night alone theyve lost the groove and feel almost shy around each other. They arrive at the sex tape idea as a chance to do something new to liven things up. Up to this point ""Sex Tape"" is brutally honest about how marriage and family can kill spontaneity and make it difficult for spouses to connect. The language is coarse but feels real and the actors though not technically nude for the camera were clearly nude for each other and this gives the sense of people putting it out there taking some risks. ... But then the movie pulls back. Georges Feydeau the great 19th century comic playwright made a study of farce early in his career and he developed this rule Whenever you have two people who absolutely must not meet - or else disaster will ensue - its the obligation of the playwright to have those two characters run into each other as soon as possible. As a corollary we might add this rule In an outrageous comedy whenever you have something that absolutely must not happen - or else disaster will ensue - the screenwriter must make that happen and happen quickly. The screenwriter has to because its what the audience wants. And thats the whole problem with ""Sex Tape"" in a sentence After its first third the two lead characters just run around trying to prevent something that the audience very much wants to see happen. In fact these characters are trying to stop what the audience goes into the movie desiring and expecting. After all arent there more comic possibilities in a movie in which the sex tape does go out - immediately - and is seen by everybody - immediately? What we actually get is much more tame but tame only by the standards of modern comedy. Twenty years ago this would have been groundbreaking. The actors work well together - they seem married - and Diaz in particular has hit her comic stride in recent years. No more vapid smiles and giggles; these days she has an edge. Also look out for Jack Black who has a nice featured role as a pornography kingpin. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Segel--whose dramatic weight loss has been much noted in the press--and Cameron Diaz play a married couple Jay and Annie who try to reinvigorate their flagging sex life by making a home movie on Jays iPad in which they attempt every position in The Joy of Sex. Jay carelessly saves the video to a sharable drive and because he regularly gives away his old iPads to friends and colleagues they can all access the file. Most of the movie takes place over one long night as the tech-savvy couple (hes a music producer shes a popular ""mommy blogger"") try to hunt down the old computers before anyone else sees the video--or God forbid uploads it to the Internet. Given all the name-brand products invoked their misadventure suggests a sort of nightmarish shopping spree.

Youre in greater danger of taking a nap than needing a safe word.Theres the barest hint of a promising idea in the premise that a vanilla married couple film their own private sex tape which accidentally threatens to find its way onto the Web. Watching a couple cope with the fallout would have been interesting. Theres a moment even when the characters entertain some soul-searching to figure out what went so askew in their romance that they needed to turn to extreme measures to want each other again.Instead the film abandons introspection for sitcom high jinks and you get to see Jason Segel beat up a dog.Diaz and Segel play Annie and Jay a couple a decade or so into matrimony and parenthood who one day take a step back from their routine sexless existence and wonder ""How the hell do you get it back?""Annies time is taken up by kids and blogging -- shes a professional mommy blogger with a lucrative deal on the line with a major childrens toy company (headed by Rob Lowe) that wants her to be the squeaky-clean mom voice for its brand.AZCENTRALSummer movie guide 2014 releasesJay has an even vaguer fairy-tale job -- a music writer? an editor? a DJ? -- that means going to a lot of concerts and collecting cool Belle and Sebastian concert posters to decorate their immaculate house which looks less like the home of two small children and more like an Etsy staging area.His poorly justified job comes with one other amazing perk iPads. Lots and lots of iPads (with amazing resolution Segel is only too keen to repeatedly point out) which he syncs up with his home computer then gives out as gifts to friends so he can share his immaculately cultivated playlists. They give one to Annies mother to the mailman to Annies prospective boss (which seems more than a little unethical).Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel in a scene from ""Sex Tape."" (Photo Sony Pictures)To celebrate Annies prospective windfall the couple ditch the kids and commit themselves to a night of lovemaking. When they cant quite get into the groove they pound shots of tequila and come up with the idea to film themselves (on their new iPad with amazing resolution) trying out every position in ""The Joy of Sex"" in an epic three-hour romp.Jay of course neglects to erase the video which thanks to the syncing app Jay uses for his playlists finds its way onto all the devices the couple has gifted to family and friends which illogically necessitates a night of mad scrambling to retrieve all the iPads.These are shallow characters with distressingly fake jobs clearly retrofitted to make the unnecessarily convoluted plot work -- which still doesnt. Anybody with a passing familiarity with modern technology (or a modicum of common sense) can figure out the technological solution it takes Jay nearly the entire movie to realize and only after its pointed out to him rendering their painfully awkward adventure not just dumb but wholly unnecessary.AZCENTRALAll the reviews Weekend movie guide for PhoenixIt didnt need to be this stupid. Diaz and Segel are gifted comedic performers and director Jake Kasdan once gave us the very funny ""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"" and had the wherewithal to cast Lowe whose own past sex-tape woes seemed to promise some sort of smart insider commentary. Instead were punished with a film whose laziness and lack of creativity is far more embarrassing than getting caught acting out anything from ""The Joy of Sex.""Diaz and Segel shouldnt be worried about their sex tape getting out to the public; its ""Sex Tape"" they should be worried about.AZCENTRALSex Tape (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReview Sex Tape 1.5 starsDirector Jake Kasdan.Cast Cameron Diaz Jason Segel Rob Lowe.Rating R for strong sexual content nudity language and some drug use. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1mROKCv More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

They did it in the car. They did it in the quad. They did it until they shook the books out of the library stacks. Then Annie got pregnant and a decade went by and they became busy harried L.A. parents with carpools and deadlines and no time for the randy gymnastics of their youth. The spark isnt gone but its definitely dimmed. ""How the hell do you get it back?"" Annie now a mommy blogger with a pending book contract asks her readers. Because this movie is called Sex Tape and not A Nice Spa Weekend in Napa you can probably guess the answer With the help of some old roller skates a bottle of tequila and a vintage copy of The Joy of Sex Annie and Jay decide to make their own home movie. Which goes great until Jay accidentally uploads the result to every iPad hes ever given away to friends and neighbors and the Rasputin-bearded mailman and cant digitally retrieve it (""It went up to the cloud...Nobody understands the cloud Its a f--ing mystery"") leaving them no choice but to go out and physically wipe or steal or smash each one. Thats when Sex Tape becomes a caper not unlike Horrible Bosses or Were the Millers or [insert another Jason Sudeikis movie of your choice here]. Its clumsy and wacky and intermittently amusing and Rob Lowe looks like hes having a great time playing Real-Life Ned Flanders With a Deeply Weird Side once again. (Jack Blacks uncredited bit as an internet porn magnate is less fun). Director Jake Kasdan who also helmed Bad Teacher and produced Friends With Kids doesnt quite seem to know what tone hes going for and the last half of the movie veers wildly between crude hard-R comedy and warm-hearted teachable moments. Blessedly its also short; roughly half the running time of the three hours Annie and Jay clock in their much-vaunted sexcapades. So everybody gets their happy ending.

As a married couple trying to revive their love life Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel prove that the homemade porn industry may be thriving but the romantic comedy is nearly extinct With her blond good looks her knowing cheer and a smile that spreads across her face like an earthquakes fault line Cameron Diaz is a natural for romantic comedy. In her new R-rated Sex Tape she plays Annie wife of Jason Segels Jay and 10 years after they fell in love she finds that their routine of work and parenthood has sapped the erotic ecstasy they once felt just by staring at each other. On her chatty blog she asks ""How the hell do you get it back?"" You might pose the same question about the rom-com; these are perilous times for one of Hollywoods richest and most reliable genres. Maybe modern culture is the culprit. The old trope of boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl -- a love story promising permanence -- seems utterly out of sync with an age when boy and girl meet online hook up in college never need marry and if they do have a 50% chance of getting a no-fault divorce. Or perhaps we should blame bromance the bonding of man to man has nearly replaced the guy-gal model. (READ Mary Pols on Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel in Bad Teacher) Whatever the reason no period in film history has been so rich in actresses primed to play romantic comedy and so poor in the quality of the movies they have to make. Veteran beguilers like Julia Roberts Sandra Bullock and Diaz and more recent stars like Jennifer Lopez Reese Witherspoon Katherine Heigl Kate Hudson Amy Adams Elizabeth Banks and Emma Stone all boast deft line-reading skills and high adorability quotients yet most of their rom-coms stink. The only reason not to write a learned essay on the topic is thats its too depressing. Grant the makers of Sex Tape -- Segel and cowriters Nicholas Stoller and Kate Angelo working with director Jake Kasdan -- their worthy attempt to update the traditional romantic comedy while adhering to the genres verities. Annie and Jay whose love has deteriorated into rote endearments pronounced on the fly between more pressing duties seize a rare night alone together without their two kids to rekindle the spark by performing all possible positions illustrated in Alex Comforts 1972 manual The Joy of Sex. They work away at it for three hours -- apparently Jay has impressive powers of recuperation -- and have a great refreshing time. Small oops Jay accidentally uploaded their improvised exertions to the cloud for easy viewing by the many friends relatives and acquaintances to whom hes given an iPad. (FIND Alex Comforts The Joy of Sex on the all-TIME 100 Nonfiction Books list) Ignore for the moment that Apple says this simply cant happen and consider the change in popular mores since 1995 when Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lees explicit tryst on a yacht stoked a sensation on something called VHS. (The very phrase ""sex tape"" is an endearing anachronism.) These days everybodys doing it recording it and uploading it. Nude selfies abound and YouPorn is according to one recent survey the 83rd most popular website in the world just slightly ahead of Time.com. For some people like Paris Hilton a sex tape is a career move; for others like Anthony Weiner a nude selfie is a career-ender. Annie who is this close to securing a big payoff for her blog from a childrens toy conglomerate would be in the latter category. She and Jay must suppress their video triumph. Banks and Seth Rogen traveled a similar route as a nice couple who go down and dirty in Kevin Smiths bumpily agreeable 2008 comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno. There both stars seemed willing accomplished participants. In Sex Tape Diaz fulfills her side of the bargain miming radiance or desperation at the appropriate times as if she were in a pretty good movie. Not so Segel who in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and The Five-Year Engagement displayed the charm of an engaging galoot. This time he often speaks his lines -- and remember theyre lines he helped write -- with the disheartened robotoid elocution of a prisoner in an al Qaeda video. (READ Corlisss review of Zach and Miri Make a Porno) He has our sympathy since halfway into the film hes being chased around a mansion by a ravenous German Shepherd. The swank digs belong to Hank Rosenbaum (Rob Lowe) CEO of the company that may buy Annies blog. At the office Hank is a dewy bespectacled John Green type; at home he shows Annie his bizarre tattoos the collection of paintings hes commissioned -- with himself as for example Rafiki in The Lion King -- and his stash of cocaine. While Annie is talking and toking Jay is in a death match with that vicious canine. Its a scene from a worse movie than Sex Tape has been but not as awful as Sex Tape will become in its endless and implausible third act. Rob Corddry and the appealing Ellie Kemper (Erin Hannon on The Office) play the mandatory neighbor couple and young Harrison Holzer nails the role of their snooty scheming son. Lowe who survived his own sex-tape scandal a generation ago and looks not a day older lends a sweet derangement to the movie just as its going massively stupid preposterous yet boring. Sex Tape doesnt fall off the cliff of competence so much as it executes a slow agonized mudslide of failed intentions. Your watch tells you that the film lasts 95 minutes; your sinking spirit says its at least as long as Jay and Annies porn epic -- without the redeeming prurient interest. Its a sex comedy about love. And thats the oddest element of this latest demonstration that the romantic comedy is a fatally endangered species. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Entertainment ""Sex Tape"" Makes Sex Seem Shameful Cameron Diaz and Jason Segels new movie is an R-rated comedy thats surprisingly cautious about sex. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel in Sex Tape. Columbia Pictures ID 3408586 The premise of Sex Tape which opens nationwide this Friday is on point in our age of rampant self-documentation and fears about accidental internet celebrity...at least in theory. Married couple Annie (Cameron Diaz) and Jay (Jason Segel) realize their love life has wilted now that theyre working(ish) parents -- shes a mommy blogger poised to sell her site and hes in radio or whatever. And with their two kids away for the night the couple tries to spice things up by tossing back tequila shots and making their own adult home video. Then thanks to the magic of movies and some mumbo jumbo about Jays habit of trading up iPads he syncs using a custom app the video ends up in the hands of everyone hes gifted with a secondhand device including their best friends (Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper) Annies potential new boss (Rob Lowe) and the mailman (Dave Allen). Its the setup for some bawdy laughs about what happens when you become accidental porn stars and the world wide web is given entree into your most intimate moments. But Sex Tape directed by Bad Teachers Jake Kasdan and written by Segel Kate Angelo and Nicholas Stoller never makes it that far. Instead for a movie about amateur porn Sex Tape is fundamentally conservative in its treatment of sex. ID 3406037 View this image > Columbia Pictures ID 3407280 Annie and Jay meet during college (Diaz and Segel disguise themselves as early twentysomethings by wearing sweatshirts) and they may go at it eagerly frequently and everywhere but theyre still well on the road to good ol hetero monogamy white picket fence and all. The video is their first excursion into even the mildly freaky and to do it they reach back to the musty bible of lovemaking that is The Joy of Sex cycling through every position it depicts over a marathon three hours. Sex Tape is only pro-sex -- Annie and Jay talk about porn and how they used to watch it together -- in the context of marriage. Even the porn king played by Jack Black (dont ask) turns out to have tied the knot and to be a father of two and lectures the couple about how making sex tapes is a sign of how ""youve lost track of why youre fucking in the first place."" The real question of how to keep a long-term relationship passionate is skirted in favor of a rote message of remembering to appreciate your partner. And despite a stale joke about the contents of a supposedly conservative characters nightstand and how everyones hiding a wild side the whole story is basically about punishing its main characters for having dabbled in minor kink. ID 3407389 View this image > Claire Folger/Columbia Pictures ID 3408076 The movies underlying timidity isnt in line with its stars proven adventurousness in past projects -- Segels gamely gone full frontal for the sake of laughs while last years most memorable sex scene was between Diaz and a car. Sex Tapes fundamental problem beyond general unfunniness and implausibility is that it seems to agree that making a video like the one Annie and Jay do is shameful. In fact the chickenshit films most daring moment has nothing to do with sex at all. Its a sequence featuring the head of the company thats looking to buy Annies blog Hank (played by Lowe who once had his own brush with accidental amateur porn notoriousness). With his family out of town hes reflecting on his past while listening to Slayer and doing some cocaine and Annie not wanting to be rude does a line. The normalizing of the drug use which comes with no terrible consequences is edgier than anything else the movie offers -- even the contents of the video itself. And thats saying something. ID 3408212 View this image > Claire Folger/Columbia Pictures ID 3408707 Beyond the dubious claim from Blacks character that people only make sex tapes as a temporary fix for real relationship problems Sex Tape tries to boost its stakes by having Hanks company be concerned about values cautioning Annie that they dont want anything like the post she wrote about bringing the spice back to her marriage. Instead of Annie telling them to accept her as is (and lets face it who she is is hardly far out there) she and her husband accept these restrictions as totally fair and scramble to keep themselves as outwardly wholesome as possible. When a character later threatens to upload the video to YouPorn if hes not paid off the movie cant spin the development off for laughs the way it wants because its based around the idea that the sex tape going public wouldnt just be embarrassing it would ruin its characters lives. At a time in which people are (sometimes alarmingly) casual with things like nude selfies and revenge porn has become a thing a movie about the race to stop a sex tape from getting out feels like a wan exercise next to the possibility of exploring what itd be like for a suburban couple to deal with the fallout after one did.

Share Tweet Sex Tape stars Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel--whos lost so much weight that he looks like John Cassavetes--as Annie and Jay a married couple whose homemade porn falls into the wrong hands sending them on a night-long chase through the L.A. suburbs to track down and delete every copy of the video. Its less a movie than a bad sitcom episode stretched to feature length and raunched up to an R rating; a viewer half-expects Rob Lowe--whose role is composed mostly of winks at his once-tarnished public image sex tapes cocaine habit and 1989 Oscars appearance--to be billed as a guest star.Making a movie audience laugh is easy which is why laughter tends to be a poor metric for comedies. The bigger question is how the laugh works and whether the joke registers beyond that initial response. Sex Tapes laughs (it has a handful) are strictly extraneous the kind that dont depend on characterization (which is spotty) or much setup Lowes Hank Rosenbaum revealing his tattoo of Eazy-E which is never mentioned again; a character rattling off the names of real-life porn companies as a kind of free-associative interrogation technique (""Bang Bros? Bang... Bus?""); a quick Jim Carrey-style bit involving a dog and a treadmill. The result makes Segel and Diazs previous collaboration with director Jake Kasdan 2011s Bad Teacher look like goddamn Billy Wilder. For all of its flaws Bad Teacher at least rooted its jokes in the characters and their goals; here gag and plot often seem unrelated as though Segel and his regular co-writer Nicholas Stoller were trying to protect the characters from the consequences of their actions. Much of the humor hinges on potential embarrassment but is setup in such a way that Annie and Jay never have to experience any real humiliation. The movies one good recurring gag is that the lengths Jay and Annie go to--snooping around friends homes breaking into a websites server room--are only motivated by their ignorance of technology; it hints at how inconsequentially plotted the whole thing is. Despite its coke jokes and conveniently obscured nudity Sex Tape is fuddy-duddy and focused on protecting the nuclear family at any cost. Sex is weird and unflattering and the sex tape--and any kind of sexual activity that falls outside the usual rom-com spectrum--is presented as a symbol of desperation. For just a brief moment in a scene where Annie and Jay learn that the video has been uploaded to the real-life streaming site YouPorn Sex Tape flirts with something transgressive--the idea that exposure doesnt matter and that there are more important things to worry about than whether strangers have seen you having sex.But then it turns out to be a setup for yet another shameless iPad plug. Sex Tape has countless ""jokes"" about the Apple tablets surprising durability excellent camera sync-ability and app selection; in many ways its the most-developed character in the movie.

So it is with ""Sex Tape"" an awkward and distinctly unsexy farcical misfire starring Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz as a married suburban couple who wake up one morning to discover that their iPad-recorded nookie session is about to go viral. This movie sometimes resembles an R-rated Apple infomercial - Segel actually delivers an enthusiastic monologue about the hi-res camera on the new iPad - but if that was the deal the Cupertino folks need to get their money back.""Sex Tape"" was directed by Jake Kasdan (son of ""Big Chill"" and ""Body Heat"" director Lawrence Kasdan) and its screenplay is credited to Segel Kate Angelo and Nicholas Stoller all purportedly adult native speakers of English. None of that mitigates the curious sense of cluelessness and antiquity around this whole enterprise which evinces little actual understanding of the Internet or social media and features a set of oddly dusty cultural references. For example whoa -- did you know that Pamela Anderson apparently made a sex tape? Furthermore kids can do all kinds of crazy stuff with computers ""Sex Tape"" feels as if it were adapted from an original Bollywood version made in 2004 which was no doubt funnier before it was translated into Russian and then English. (That one would have featured ""sexy ankle shots"" instead of upside-down Jason Segel butt and Cameron Diaz doing naked gymnastics; whether those things are appealing is up to you.)In fairness late-summer Hollywood misfires often contain hidden treasures; when you have to fill 90 minutes or so of screen time and the story is obviously not working anything goes. The utterly formulaic marriage comedy at the beginning and end of ""Sex Tape"" brackets an episode of total insanity involving Rob Lowe as the aggressively wholesome CEO of a family-products corporation that supposedly wants to buy Diazs mommy-blog for piles of money. (Another reference that seems ancient OMG bloggers) When Segel and Diaz show up at Lowes grandiose mansion on the flimsiest of pretexts - theyre trying to physically recover all the iPads that contain the sex video and yeah thats idiotic - he seems slightly unshaven and unfocused. Lowes wife and kids are ""away"" possibly forever and he invites the couple in for an extended interlude that involves death metal cocaine a digitally operated fireplace troubling works of art and an 11-inch two-headed dildo. Its as if the marriage farce has suddenly dropped away and weve been er thrust into some arty horror-comedy or outtakes from Lars von Triers ""Nymphomaniac."" You Might Also Like It tells you a lot about the semi-completed WTF character of ""Sex Tape"" that the question of whether Lowes company is going to make Diaz unbelievably rich - because nothing says big money like suburban mommy bloggers - is never answered and his force of delirious anarchy disappears from the film. There are other smidgens of fun to be mined here including the estimable Rob Corddry and Ellie Kemper repeatedly stealing their scenes as Diaz and Segels supposed best friends who appear to have enjoyed the sex tape just a little too much. What I can say about the two leads is that theyre in great shape and seem game for anything; they generate plenty of good cheer but not much sexual chemistry. It possibly counts as Hollywood progress that Diaz can be cast in a sexy leading role at age 41 opposite a younger guy. But by the time Diaz and Segel encounter Jack Black as a sleazy porn entrepreneur delivering late-night relationship advice in a would-be wacky episode that goes nowhere the good cheer has pretty much dissipated and the movies not even close to done.

A married couple loses a very private home movie. Director Jake Kasdan (134). R Sex nudity language drugs. Area theaters. After all the anticipation the excitement the buildup ... Jake Kasdans ""Sex Tape"" winds up giving us too much talk and too little action. How could a movie that offers Jason Segel riffing on sex and Cameron Diaz regularly disrobing be so dull ? Its all in the execution. Kasdans delivered before (""Walk Hard"" ""Bad Teacher""). But this time he just doesnt have the moves. His smutty comedy is staid and frantic rather than sexy and loose. The first problem lies in the casting. Diaz and Segel are pros who know exactly what a studio movie needs. But despite their snarky-funny connection in ""Bad Teacher"" they feel mismatched as madly-in-love suburbanites Annie and Jay. Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz get ready to frolic in Sex Tape. (Claire Folger) Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel with kids Giselle Eisenberg and Sebastian Thomas in Sex Tape (Claire Folger) After a few years and a couple of kids they realize they need to rekindle their old spark. Annie suggests they tape themselves re-enacting every position in ""The Joy of Sex"" as long as Jay promises to erase it all in the morning. Naturally he forgets. And in one of many sitcomish mishaps the video winds up on a stack of iPads he gives out to friends as gifts the next day. So despite the title youre really paying to watch a generic married couple and their mildly quirky best friends (Ellie Kemper and Rob Corddry) run around town for a night trying to get a bunch of iPads back. Its a lazy idea but the script has even bigger problems. Most notably theres way too much exposition. Were constantly being told rather than shown whats happened. Poor camera work and editing only solidify the sluggish pacing. Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel in the R-rated Sex Tape. (Art Streiber) That said the movie isnt a total dud. Segel and Nicholas Stoller worked with original writer Kate Angelo and their skewed sense of humor perks up the formulaic template. There are a few laugh-out-loud gags scattered throughout especially when Rob Lowe (as Annies seemingly uptight boss) and Jack Black (as a sentimental porn baron) appear. Segel and Diaz were clearly enthusiastic about making this ""hard R movie"" and keep the energy up while regularly stripping down (we get rear and side views if you must know). But they have no real romantic chemistry and mostly weak material to work with. So no matter how many dirty words they use -- or how many positions they talk about twisting themselves into -- the whole affair just feels like a tease. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews sex tape cameron diaz jason segal jack black rob lowe jake kasdan comedy ellie kemper rob corddry Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Who should be more embarrassed the husband and wife who accidentally release a homemade porn video in ""Sex Tape"" or the studio thats willfully distributing ""Sex Tape""? Basically an extended marital-therapy session wrapped in an iPad commercial this surprisingly bland Cameron Diaz-Jason Segel vehicle has a marketably racy premise but takes it in a stilted unfunny direction that leaves both actors flailing about sort of like the translucent red double-ended dildo that gets whipped out in an especially sad fit of comic desperation. Interesting mainly as a sign of how thoroughly smut Apple products and smut viewable on Apple products have seeped into contemporary life Sonys July 18 release might attract audiences starved for a decent R-rated summer comedy following recent hits ""Neighbors"" and ""22 Jump Street"" but seems unlikely to show anywhere near the same box office stamina. In one of the more unorthodox post-Muppets-movie career moves in Hollywood history regular writing partners Segel and Nicholas Stoller (teaming with scribe Kate Angelo who is credited with the story) have attempted a moderately risque adult laffer that retains some of the sweetness and spark of their Judd Apatow-produced collaborations such as ""The Five-Year Engagement"" and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" As directed by Jake Kasdan ""Sex Tape"" also bears a superficial resemblance to the Stoller-helmed ""Neighbors"" a much sharper comedy about a couple seeking naughty relief from their boring domestic routine. It wasnt always thus for Annie (Diaz) and Jay (Segel) who as seen in a belabored opening montage used to be dynamite in the sack doing the deed whenever and wherever they liked -- in the bedroom the shower the car public parks Mexican restaurants etc. Ten years later theyre married with two children (Sebastian Hedges Thomas Giselle Eisenberg) a two-story West L.A. home and busy professional lives -- shes a mommy blogger he works in radio -- leaving them little time for intimacy. When they do finally get an evening all to themselves dropping the kids off with Grandma (a sweet Nancy Lenehan) they have an unusually hard time getting into the mood leading Annie to suggest they spice things up by starring in their own X-rated video. Shot on Jays new iPad -- which as the characters pause to advertise more than once comes equipped with an ultra-high-def camera -- the resulting three-hour amateur epic shows (or rather suggests) Annie and Jay demonstrating every position in their well-thumbed copy of ""The Joy of Sex."" But rather than listening to Annie and immediately deleting the video afterward Jay accidentally uploads it to the cloud -- where thanks to an unpredictable new syncing app its automatically downloaded onto several iPads he gave to friends and family as gifts. And so with the help of their friends Robby (Rob Corddry) and Tess (Ellie Kemper) whose own prurient interest in the videos contents becomes something of a running gag Annie and Jay must track down the tainted tablets and erase the evidence before anyone else views it -- especially Hank Rosenbaum (Rob Lowe) the family-values-minded CEO whose company is considering acquiring Annies blog. Despite the apparent unlikelihood of such a gaffe actually happening on paper it sounds like fairly relevant material for our sex-obsessed technologically paranoid digital era -- a comedy geared toward an audience presumably familiar with the ins and outs of Internet porn and well aware that their most sensitive personal data could be one stray click away from public exposure. In the execution however ""Sex Tape"" is an unaccountable drag -- strained toothless and far too tame to achieve the sort of outrageous raunchy-titillating effect its aiming for. This is in effect an R-rated movie with a coy PG-13 sensibility which can be chalked up in part to the fairly inexplicit sex scenes -- a few moments of self-consciously casual rear nudity aside theres nothing here to shock those who saw the much edgier ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" or Segels full-frontal displays in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" But that disinterest in pushing the visual envelope matters far less than the movies failure to fully exploit the comedic or dramatic potential of its material. Rather than say forcing the two leads to confront the horrifying humiliating consequences of their decision the script sends them on an inane all-night mission to keep the video from going viral during which they are beset by attack dogs pre-adolescent sociopaths and surprisingly benign porn-world denizens. (As played by an unbilled actor in an amusing cameo the owner of YouPorn turns out to be whaddya know a pretty sweet guy.) When its not stuck in farce mode the movie is a formulaic reconciliation drama in which Annie and Jay must reaffirm their love and address the underlying intimacy issues that led them to make a sex tape in the first place. Diaz and Segel who made such a pleasingly disreputable pair in Kasdans underrated ""Bad Teacher"" are nice enough company as always. But in the absence of any real characters to play they seem weirdly detached from every word and gesture like half-hearted improv artists trying to wring a few decent sketches from the words ""sex tape."" The movies lengthy comic centerpiece finds Annie and Jay dropping by Hanks Brentwood mansion and if anyone here deserves a prize for being a good sport its surely Lowe whose entire performance is a not-so-veiled reference to the famous leaked video that almost derailed his career in the late 80s. His tongue planted perhaps a bit too firmly in cheek Lowe is all smiles and positive energy in the role of a straight-laced cardigan-wearing family man who in his downtime likes to listen to Slayer and snort lines of cocaine. Jabbing at everything from the actors past substance abuse to the infamous Snow White Oscars debacle its a mightily self-deprecating turn -- and if its not exactly a laugh riot it affords one of the few moments in ""Sex Tape"" where you sense that someone onscreen is actually having a good time.

DeDe says July 20 2014 at 1213 pm I have been told by friends and family to go and see this and that movie then when I go I dont think Its funny. They tell me I cant believe you didnt find that funny. Everyone has different ideas about what is funny and what is not. So I dont rely on peoples opinions of movies I usually go by who is in the movie. Many of the comedies out there today you have actors and actresses play the same type of character in a different movie. Many are over paid. Usually when you see a lot of push for a movie or TV show I find its in trouble from the start. Reply Steve says July 17 2014 at 350 pm Coming from one of the worst longest-running sitcoms ever (How I Met Your Mother) Jason Segel has never failed to bore me into a coma. I dont get his appeal nor have I seen anything that lets me know he can actually write. ""Forgetting Sara Marshall"" was lame beyond belief and this looks like another ""stellar"" effort. Reply crookedmindframe says July 16 2014 at 356 am I honestly hated everything about Bad Teacher so this isnt surprising... Reply toons says July 16 2014 at 106 am i dont trust critics on comedies these days. they were right about million ways to die in the west but totally wrong about last summers were the millers. they hated bad teacher but it was a fun comedy. Reply JD says July 16 2014 at 158 am Would have to disagree about A Million Ways to Die in the West as I enjoyed that. True there were a lot of jokes that werent funny but there were plenty that were funny. Would agree about Were the MIllers and Bad Teacher as both were very funny.

Daily Edition Login to download Sex Tape Film Review 730 PM PDT 7/15/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Sexcruciating TWITTER Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel cant save this ineptly directed preposterously plotted raunchfest. Sex Tape is sexcruciating. This high-concept low-brow comedy about a couple whose homemade sex video threatens to get out there for the world to see is mostly about whats below the belt but also seems to want to be family-friendly in a perverse sort of way. The films one-joke nature makes it an easy sell for Sony but director Jake Kasdan never finds the right tone or um rhythm for an intimate encounter you increasingly wish could just be a quickie. Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel have previously proven that theyre game for just about anything that even remotely qualifies for an R rating. And so they do again here beginning with the hyperactive prologue which catalogs the vigorous and abundant sex life that Annie and Jay had prior to having kids. Then comes the 64000 question posed by Annie ""How the hell do you get it back?"" LIST Hollywoods 100 Favorite Films The answer according to the thoroughly preposterous and structurally patchy script by Kate Angelo Segel and Nicholas Stoller is to star in your own porn video. The couple decides its to be a literary adaptation an unabridged rendition of The Joy of Sex featuring every position described therein -- though all the camera angles featured in the excerpts shown make you wonder who the operator was. Becoming film stars for a night has the desired effect on their libidos but the next day Jay discovers that hes made a big boo-boo Instead of erasing the fruits of their labors as Annie has requested he seems to have mistakenly pushed a button on his iPad thats sent it up to ""the cloud."" This will supposedly enable everyone to watch it beginning with their friends who in ludicrous plot contrivance No. 1 have been the recipients of his used iPads. The panicked couple now endeavors to retrieve the devices before its too late even as one text anonymously arrives suggesting someone has already seen it. The technological aspects of this setup have already been attacked as bogus by those who claim to know about such things. Should one of these experts have shown up at the couples door at this point the film could have ended there and we would have already seen all the juicy stuff. PHOTOS Movies That Became TV Shows About a Boy Fargo Bad Teacher and More But no such luck. Instead a staggeringly awful second act ensues in which Jay and Annie embark upon a ridiculous nocturnal tour of what looks like Bel Air under the guise of gathering donations. What theyre actually doing is trying to prevent the boss of a squeaky-clean toy company which may pay big bucks for Annies mothering blog from stumbling across the tape on the iPad shes given him. A different man when hes home alone with his family away than he is at the office Hank (Rob Lowe) quite absurdly gets Annie high on cocaine while Jay snoops around the house looking for the device all the while pursued by a ferocious German Shepherd in some of the most continuity-challenged scenes in a mainstream film in recent memory. In the end however Annie and Jay realize that their handiwork isnt up in a cloud somewhere but in an anonymous warehouse out in the San Fernando Valley. The impresario of said establishment which specializes in disseminating homemade porn is played with relish by an uncredited Jack Black and while hes hobbled by the material here his appearance underlines the fact that Black has mostly vanished from the big screen since his great performance in Bernie three years ago. Its high time for him to come back. PHOTOS Naked Ambition From Adam Levine to Miley Cyrus Hollywoods Most Daring Magazine Nudity The films milieu bespeaks the same privileged west-of-the-405 mindset that figures in Judd Apatows work with much the same jargon and worldview but with far fewer laughs. Noticeably slimmed down from when he first bared all in Forgetting Sarah Marshall Segel nonetheless overstays his welcome appearing again in the buff; one hopes hell quickly find other frontiers to explore. Diaz also shows some skin albeit a bit less and her go-with-the-flow spirit is fundamentally agreeable. Still the script basically asks just two registers from her anger and over-the-top enthusiasm and the films broadness eventually makes both modes tiresome. The castmember who comes off best is teenager Harrison Holzer who plays Jays best friends son a tubby arrogant bully of enormous presumption who attempts to blackmail Jay into paying an outrageous amount to remove the footage from the cloud launchpad. His character makes one ponder the possibilities for a great modern horror film centered on overprivileged West Side teens. This is Sixteen anyone?

Then things get risky (SONY/CLAIRE FOLGER) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 15 2014 at 1133 PM updated July 15 2014 at 1159 PM comments In ""Sex Tape"" Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel worry their marriage is getting a little dull a little routine a little... chaste. So they dig out a book on carnal connections set up their laptop camera and decide to make their own sex tape. They just forget to erase it afterwards -- and then watch in horror as it accidentally goes public. Thats their big mistake. The movies error? It burlesques ""The Joy of Sex"" but remains weirdly joyless. Give Diaz the benefit of the doubt. She has always had a raunchy sense of humor which has sometimes hit (""Theres Something About Mary"") and sometimes not (""The Sweetest Thing""). But if Kristen Wiigs ""Bridesmaids"" was the breakthrough Diaz films were laying the groundwork. And director Jake Kasdan -- who also got her and Segel some dirty laughs in ""Bad Teacher"" -- does start things off well with a quickly cut sequence detailing their unions hot-and-heavy early days - when to twist a current phrase it was all about conscious coupling. But once the tape -- which isnt actually a tape but a computer file -- gets made and then gets out the movie loses its way. That seems to be the fault of the script although trying to figure out exactly where a rewritten screenplay went wrong is like trying to autopsy a giant jellyfish. Wait here? Or...here? The original idea came from Kate Angelo who wrote the Jennifer Lopez snoozer ""The Back-Up Plan""; it was then redone by Segel and his frequent writing partner Nicholas Stoller who collaborated on the screenplays for ""The Muppets"" and ""The Five-Year Engagement."" On the face of it theyre definitely the more reliable source of laughs. But their movies have a sort of meandering approach to structure and a weakness for giving far too much screentime to Jason Segel. And those are the two biggest problems ""Sex Tape"" has. For example the plot is all over the place. Is it about getting back the individual IPads the files been loaded onto? Yes -- until it becomes about a blackmailer. Which preoccupies it until it becomes about an assault on a websites computer servers. One of these sequences -- involving a visit to an oddball corporate exec played by Rob Lowe -- is occasionally funny mostly because of a running gag about the mans awful taste in art. (And the deliberate casting of sex-tape pioneer Lowe -- along with a very quick reference to ""the Snow White incident"" -- is slyly wicked.) But the other sequences arent funny and go on too long. And expect far too confidently that we are going to find extended closeups of Segels big pale mugging face absolutely hilarious. Diaz who I think would probably win both genders vote for Best Person To Hit Happy Hour With is a good sport and gets most of the laughs (as well as several shameless chances to show off her toned bod). Lowe is slightly satisfyingly strange. But in the end ""Sex Tape"" doesnt seduce it doesnt surprise and it certainly doesnt satisfy. It only leaves you feeling a little taken advantaged of as you take your walk of shame back to your car -- and hoping you never hear from it again. Ratings note The film contains nudity sexual situations alcohol abuse strong language and violence. Sex Tape (R) Sony (90 min.) Directed by Jake Kasdan. With Cameron Diaz Jason Segel.
