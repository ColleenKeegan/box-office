Photo credit Garth Stead / Lions Gate Publicity Photo Garth Stead Lord of War lost in no-mans-land between fact and fiction 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Lord of War Drama. Starring Nicolas Cage Bridget Moynahan and Ethan Hawke. Directed by Andrew Niccol. (R. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Lord of War"" traces the story of a big-time arms dealer over the course of 18 years but it plays more as an excuse for writer-director Andrew Niccol to investigate the general topic of arms dealing rather than an effort to tell a specific story. Its like a subject in search of a drama. The film is always at least mildly interesting because international arms dealing is a fairly compelling issue but its never as informative as a good documentary nor as engrossing as a good narrative. Its a hybrid thats frustrating in two distinct ways. The missed dramatic opportunities make for the first frustration. Nicolas Cage plays Yuri a Ukrainian American from Brooklyn whos living a go-nowhere life when he witnesses a gangland assassination close-up. His immediate reaction to seeing two guys get killed in front of him isnt to get scared or want to move to a better neighborhood. Rather in a flash he decides he wants to sell illegal weapons figuring that the market will never dry up that people will always want to kill each other. One would think that any fellow whos that crazy amoral and adventurous deserves to be the subject of a film and who better than Cage to play such a combination of bizarre inspiration and cold calculation? But soon we realize that Yuris arms-dealing epiphany is not there for the purpose of introducing us to a wild personality but rather as a kind of shorthand to get our hero into the gun business as quickly as possible. That Yuri is played by Cage is a calculated distraction Cages previous association with thoughtful but volatile characters helps to disguise for a time that Yuri is in fact a cipher a sober and bland figure whose internal life remains a mystery not because hes mysterious but because nothing is there. To put it in another way Yuri is not dead inside -- rather he wasnt given insides by the writer. Hes a shell perhaps a composite meant to stand as an exemplar of all arms dealers. This strategy might have worked in dramatic terms if Yuri were meant to be seen at a remove as a dark elusive figure haunting and helping to create scenes of human misery. But ""Lord of War"" is structured more like a classic tragedy in which a capable but overly ambitious man succumbs to temptation achieves great heights but loses his soul. The catch is that a character has to have a soul in order to lose one. To fill out the human side of Yuri Niccol attempts to ground him in relationships. He is given a brother (Jared Leto) with a substance abuse problem that has nothing to do with anything. He is given old-world parents. His wife is a potentially interesting character especially as played by Bridget Moynahan -- shes a former model with artistic longings and a strong moral core. But though she and Yuri are presented as a love match their relationship is way in the background and doesnt exactly make sense. So far as we can tell he sees her every month or so. In the foreground are Yuris arms deals which get bigger and bigger. In the manner of a Scorsese gangster Yuri narrates his adventures which take him from Little Odessa in Brooklyn to Eastern Europe and to the Middle East and Africa but mainly Ukraine and Liberia. In Ukraine there are unbelievable stockpiles of weaponry left sitting there after the Cold War and in Liberia theres a charismatic and sadistic despot (Eamonn Walker) with an unlimited supply of enemies. Along the way the movie comes up with perfunctory turning points for Yuri so that we can see him hitting rock bottom morally. But he hits rock bottom more than once and the second time doesnt have much meaning. Anyway since he starts the movie just a few inches from the bottom he cant land with any impact. The audience is barely interested and Niccol can barely fake it. The movies second big frustration is that it inspires questions that it doesnt answer -- that it obviously could not answer without breaking into straight documentary mode. Just one example of many Our hero walks into a country and orders a fleet of tanks and assorted helicopter gun ships. He arrives by himself. Hes a one-man business. So how does he move that weaponry since he cant fit it in the overhead compartment? And where does he store it before he finds a buyer? And how does he pay for it -- Visa? MasterCard? If he shows them his drivers license will they take a check? There are the makings here of a really good feature or an even better documentary but as it stands ""Lord of War"" is not quite either. -- Advisory Intense violence sexual situations and unpleasant language.

"Lord of War Drives The Devils Bargain washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Lord of War Drives The Devils Bargain Nicolas Cage is well cast as the self-mythologizing gunrunner to dictators and thugs the world over. (By Garth Stead -- Lions Gate Films Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 16 2005 Imagine the story of a ruthlessly amoral gun runner as it would be told in ""GoodFellas"" and ""Three Kings"" and you get pretty close to ""Lord of War"" Andrew Niccols stylish provocative thriller starring Nicolas Cage. But its not really a thriller; indeed throughout this fast-moving darkly comic drama viewers are pretty certain whats going to happen next. Were pretty sure for example that Cages character Yuri Orlov doesnt die in the end because he narrates his story as one long flashback to the present moment in which hes standing in an impossibly huge expanse of spent bullet shells. That shot is so stylized so visually bold that at first Orlov seems to be speaking from some kind of mercenary heaven where the ordnance is never-ending and free. But as ""Lord of War"" gets underway its clear that the outsized visual style has less to do with the afterlife than with Niccols own dazzling eye and Yuris self-mythologizing memory. It all started he explains in the films omnipresent voice-over in Brighton Beach N.Y. -- or more precisely in Ukraine whose emigre community settled in that neighborhood decades ago. Thats where Yuri and his little brother Vitaly (Jared Leto rockin a convincing Jackson Browne haircut) grew up with their mother and father the latter of whom pretended to be a Jew to get out of the Soviet Union and who took that identity to heart (""I like the hat"" he explains). With swift darkly knowing humor Yuri recounts how he sold his first black-market gun to a Russian gang member then slowly built his business into the mega-million arms operation it became when the Cold War ended. ""The arms bazaar was open"" as he says and he began purveying tanks grenades RPGs and M16s to any country warlord drug dealer or tinhorn dictator who wanted them. ""I didnt sell to bin Laden"" Yuri says at one point ""not on any moral grounds but because he was always bouncing checks."" Such is the cynical wit that drives ""Lord of War"" which Niccol wrote and directed and which exhibits his signature dual devotion to sleek highly legible images and almost compulsively cerebral dialogue. (Niccol wrote ""The Truman Show"" and ""Gattaca"" which he also directed.) As Yuri proceeds with his apologia all the while taking the audience on his personal tour of the most desperate places on Earth (most of them in Africa) he keeps up a rapid-fire monologue bouncing from pronouncements about the cardinal rules of gunrunning (never get shot with your own merchandise) to delivering a rhapsodic panegyric on the glories of the 1947 Kalashnikov better known as the AK-47. Meanwhile on-screen ""Lord of War"" tells Yuris story with the same bravado and stylishness as Scorsese at his finest with bigger-than-life characters and situations splashing across the screen in breathtaking scale. (A shot of one of Yuris private transport planes landing on a crowded road in Africa is particularly beautiful in its ruthless way.) Just as were pretty sure that Yuri will survive even the most murderous circumstances of his own creation were pretty sure that his Faustian bargains will catch up with him and they do. Although Yuri quits for a while (at the behest of his swoonily passive wife played by Bridget Moynahan) like Michael Corleone sooner or later hes pulled back in specifically by the homicidally corrupt leader of Liberia and his equally psychotic son. But even as Yuri confronts the evil of his work he cant help engaging in the familiar moral ratiocination (cars and cigarettes kill more people than guns if I didnt do it someone else would etc. etc.) and reaching the final inescapable conclusion that he helps people kill other people for one simple reason Hes good at it. Cage is well cast as Yuri and he has the right scale and size to portray a man who isnt meant to resemble anyone real as much as a character from a Warren Zevon song (Niccol reportedly based ""Lord of War"" on real-life gun runners some of whom lent the production their weapons). And if Ethan Hawke isnt entirely believable as the Interpol agent who stalks him like Inspector Javert they at least have one or two sardonically amusing scenes together. The best is their last in which a sadly believable twist -- involving a double-dealing colonel clearly based on Oliver North during his Iran-contra days -- plays havoc with the agents sense of righteousness. (Ian Holm strikes a classy note as one of Yuris competitors a man of the old school who scorns the Ukrainian upstarts willingness to do business with anyone wholl pay.) In many ways ""Lord of War"" is a bookend to ""The Constant Gardener"" another movie in which Africa is being exploited by greedy morally bankrupt First World forces. But whereas Niccol clearly means to leave the audience in a state of outrage -- and one would expect nascent activism -- by showing them how complicit Western governments are in creating and sustaining men like Yuri ""Lord of War"" ends on a rather dispiriting note of defeat. Its as difficult for Niccol to indict the gun culture while fetishizing it as it is for him to make a heartfelt movie with a heartless protagonist. To fill in those blanks the filmmaker relies too heavily on a didactic epigrammatic script; Yuri doesnt talk or relate to other characters but simply delivers a series of rules and apercus that could have resulted from a collaboration between Hunter Thompson and Oscar Wilde. ""Lord of War"" has a hip gonzo energy to it and its often transfixing to watch and listen to. But its finally just as empty as the man its about. Lord of War (122 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong violence drug use profanity and sexuality.

"Sermon never runs out of ammo never knows subtlety - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections Sermon never runs out of ammo never knows subtletymovies - reviewSeptember 16 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticBlood oozes seeps and spatters in Lord of War. Its splashed against windows after a point-blank execution smeared across a floor by the dragged body of a shot Liberian soldier or leaking out of a comrade who -- in the movies anyway -- always takes more than five rounds to bring down.And yet if anything this film is entirely too bloodless.Andrew Niccol has made a Blow for the gun-running trade a failed imitation of that cocaine history/satire. These are death merchants kept at arms length especially the films cynical jokey ""hero"" who narrates his own immorality tale. Were not allowed to do much more than smirk at his cleverness and marvel at how far he falls.And fall he must because Niccol (Gattaca) is in the pulpit. See this on Friday or Saturday and you wont need to go to church on Sunday.Nicolas Cage is Yuri Orlov a Ukrainian emigre who rises from under-the-table gun seller to international gun runner. With brother Vitali (Jared Leto) guarding his back we watch Yuris 20-year climb -- buying from Uzi-making Israelis Lebanese who collect American arms abandoned when the United States left there befriending a shady Lt. Col. Southern ( Col. North might have sued) and really cashing in when the Cold War ends.Yuri leaves little to chance. He travels under many passports. He deals in cash-and-carry. He fast-talks his way out of death a dozen times.And he gets what he wants even the supermodel he has lusted after for years. His con-job courtship of Ava (Bridget Moynahan of Coyote Ugly) is a thing of beauty.Yuri is meant to be the yin to Simeon Weiszs yang. As played by Ian Holm Weisz is an arms dealer who ""takes sides."" Yuri sells to everybody. This ""take sides"" bit is one of many parables in Niccols sermon that dont pan out.The movie sprints out of the gate from its clever opening credits -- which follow a bullet from manufacture to combat use -- to the zippy way Niccol documents Yuris ascent. Every time a shell casing bounces out of a chamber in Sierra Leone or Liberia Yuri hears a ""cha-ching.""But that obviousness wears as the film slows down and we figure out were never going to get any closer to Yuri than his omnipresent suit and sunglasses. When the brothers get mixed up with Colombian drug lords and Vitaly becomes an addict Eric Clapton sings ""Cocaine"" on the soundtrack. How original.Cage is solid in the leading role narrating his flinty lines with a world-weariness that has become something of a specialty.""I supplied every army but the Salvation Army.""Hes at his best in edgy scenes haggling with Liberias trigger-happy president renamed Andre Baptiste (Charles Taylor is who he is supposed to be). Eamonn Walker and Cage make equal sparring partners. But Cage doesnt betray an emotional investment in Yuris fate and he cant expect us to either.Ethan Hawke is merely adequate in the role of the Interpol cop who can never nail Yuri with the goods. He has too many scenes where he has to give the movies not-so-subtle message about kids left with stumps for arms and the pain Yuris ""job"" spreads.And an ugly hard truth is emerging about pretty-boy Jared Leto. He cant fake a faint Ukranian accent -- ""What I wouldnt give right now for a plate of cabbage and potatoes"" -- and doesnt do well faking the coke addiction either. Hes an inanimate performer a Ken doll.Moynahan is what she plays in the movie -- a model not an actress.The topline production values give this the veneer of an action film but the smarts and intent point to something deeper a sermon the world needs to hear. But his heavy-handedness and inability to humanize and explain his hero mean that even the choir Niccol is preaching to wont be moved by Lord of War.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Theres little use arguing with writer-director Andrew Niccols visual bravado in the opening of ""Lord of War."" Arms dealer Yuri Orlov played by Nicolas Cage begins his amoral tale of supply and demand standing amid a shimmering ground cover of spent shells. Its quite the metaphor for the detritus of war. Niccol then uses digital effects to give us a bullets perspective on its trajectory from manufacturer to target. From a factory in what looks like the former Soviet Union to a chaotic street fight in an African town were the bullet. On that street were loaded into a rifle. A kid comes into cross hairs. We whiz through the air. Meant to convey the human costs of warfare its use of a child to make a point becomes a cruel and too-casual flourish. Its a self-inflicted wound ""Lord of War"" never quite recovers from. Contrary to the director and his stars apparent wish to impart lessons about the nasty wrinkle of the arms trade ""Lord of War"" represents a battle between veneer and values. Style wills out over the substantive. Yuri Orlovs family left the Ukraine as part of an exodus of that former Soviet republics Jews. Only his family isnt Jewish. Yuris father posed as Jewish wound up in New Yorks Brighton Beach and continued the ruse to the point of keeping kosher and observing the Sabbath. Yuri receives his calling when he witnesses a Russian mob hit and lives to tell. And to sell. When he begins hawking guns he invites his younger brother to join him. Jared Leto plays brother Vitaly. It doesnt take long to see that Vitaly hasnt the stomach for the merchandise or its customers. After an arms deal Vitaly splits. Later Yuri finds Vitaly snorting lines of coke and extolling drug-fueled epiphanies. Yuris own philosophizing tends toward the cynical and self-aggrandizing. ""Bullets change governments in far shorter time than votes"" he says. Or ""I sold guns to every army but the Salvation Army."" Business booms for Yuri with the fall of the Soviet Union. It doesnt hurt to have an uncle high up in the desperate and corrupt Ukrainian army. Along the way Yuri meets other champions of gray-market economics. One Simeon Weisz (Sir Ian Holm) is a smooth international operator whose quiet manner belies his trade. Yuri first meets - and is snubbed by - Weisz at an arms show in Germany. Like Mick Jaggers persona in ""Sympathy for the Devil"" Yuri is pleased to share some of the hellish scenes he has been privy to Beirut the former Soviet Union Afghanistan. ""I never sold arms to Osama bin Laden back when he was bouncing checks."" Its a line that sounds cheeky but smells too. Much of the films drama takes place in Liberia where blood diamonds help arm boy soldiers who resemble evil clown posses. Eamonn Walker plays Andre Baptiste the nations corrupt president. The elevated warlords broken English gives the film its title. Niccol tries to bring depth to Yuri with a love story. Its not the fault of Bridget Moynahan who plays supermodel Ava Fontaine that this attempt proves weak. Like Yuri who fell for Ava when he was a young man the movie is too happy to capture her beauty. Niccol (who wrote the screenplay for ""The Terminal"") sets off to show us Yuris amoral world. Yet like some undercover narc he becomes so bewitched he winds up mimicking his targets cravenness. The seeming love affair between director and lead character leaves Interpol agent Valentine (an underutilized Ethan Hawke) with little to do but look aggrieved at his nemesis evasiveness. Like Yuri the movie is self- aware in its way. Like Yuri too it lives off the erotic charge that comes from movie violence.

Brothers in arms Nicolas Cage and Jared Leto are in the business. Lions Gate Films This would be 2001s marginally underrated Blow Johnny Depps equally episodic hop-skip through the narcotics trade. Substitute Wars ""heat"" for Blows dope and you more or less have the same movie. And since Blows detractors regarded it as a modified knock-off of GoodFellas ... well you can see we are getting a few generations away from the source. Still War is written and directed by Andrew Niccol scripter of The Truman Show writer/director of Gattaca and thus no practitioner of doofus filmmaking. He has a serious story here The odious Uzi marketing that produces the so-called success arc enjoyed by Cages Ukrainian-American raised by immigrant parents in the humble Little Odessa section of New Yorks Brighton Beach. His business enables him to amass enough cash to win a hitherto unapproachable neighborhood babe (bland Bridget Moynahan as a supermodel who also got out of the neighborhood). About the movie Lord of War   1/2 Stars Nicolas Cage Jared Leto Bridget Moynahan Ethan Hawke Ian Holm Director Andrew Niccol Distributor Lions Gate Rating R for strong violence drug use language and sexuality Running time 2 hours 6 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Cages quasi-hip narration for this said-to-be ""based on fact"" narrative presents his character as a small cog (Central Park address or not) in an international wheel of scoundrels. With everyone supposedly doing it he is free to sell goods to a pair of despotic father/son Liberian dictators -- or to compete against a senior member of the gun trade (Ian Holm in an underdeveloped role) who seems slightly less mercenary by comparison. Even for a cinematic globe-hopper War is all over the place arguments at home with a clueless spouse scary death threats in the desert continuing fights with an Interpol stalker (Ethan Hawke) his less cynical brother (Jared Leto) being dragged into the profession and merchandising at gun shows (an eye-opening scene). Even the generous running time cant contain it. Though this litany of carpings makes the movie sound worse than it is theres just not enough ammo here to allow War to break out when almost all of Hollywoods grown-up releases for 2005 are being smooshed into the same limited fall/holiday time frame. Is this a black comedy with grim moments or a personal tragedy with mordant underpinnings? Were never sure and Cages detached performance fails to make us care very much.

Watching the movie which is like a feature-length trailer crossed with a lecture held together by Nicolas Cages ""hard-boiled"" narration (""They say every man has his price but not every man gets it"") we learn that the outlaws who sell arms on the black market deal in Uzis Glocks and Kalashnikov assault rifles; that theyll offer their products to everyone from the rebels of Lebanon to the dictator of Liberia (Eamonn Walker). More than that -- and this is the films big insight so hold on to your popcorn -- we learn that weapons salesmen are sleazy troubleshooters who dont care about the harm they cause. Gosh. Cages Yuri Orlov partnering with his party-boy brother (Jared Leto) isnt much more than a generic crooked businessman boating off in dangerous gray suits to the worlds trouble spots. Lord of War comes on like its the GoodFellas of global assault hardware but Niccol stages ideas for scenes rather than the scenes themselves. He never quite creates a present tense and the result is a dead pile of information in search of a movie.

Despite Nicolas Cages strongest perf in many a season ragged shifts in tone will cool aud involvement and keep general B.O. numbers in the modest range. Brimming with cinematic confidence cynicism chutzpah plus dramatic bungles Andrew Niccols ambitious ""Lord of War"" views todays international arms trade through its anti-hero a young Ukrainian-American lured by the promise of wealth in the weapons biz. A stark departure for Niccol from his interest in the near-future (""The Truman Show"" ""Gattaca"" ""Simone"") this globalist dramedy owes much to the political gallows humor of Joseph Hellers ""Catch-22"" and the rise-and-fall structure of the conventional biopic. Despite Nicolas Cages strongest perf in many a season ragged shifts in tone will cool aud involvement and keep general B.O. numbers in the modest range. Few films since Michael Manns ""The Insider"" have tackled a burning complex contemporary topic with the ferocity and filmic energy that ""Lord of War"" applies and Niccol should earn considerable plaudits for his daring approach. Coming fast on the heels of ""The Constant Gardener"" Niccols film is more original particularly in its refreshingly politically incorrect angle on Africa. At the same time Niccols reliance on massive chunks of voice-over narration (care of the hard-working Cage) and a snide tone leave the unfortunate impression that the film is extremely callous toward its subject. ""Lord of War"" wades in the dangerous waters of politically black humor which can capsize the most important message without a strong hand in command. With Yuri Orlov (Cage) speaking directly to the camera from the first moments followed by an astonishing title sequence filmed from the p.o.v. of a bullet as it goes from being manufactured to puncturing the skull of an African youth pics strengths and problems are instantly on display. From Yuris blithe attitude toward his work as a weapons dealer to the almost goofy camera angle of the bullet the comic tone is established and then suddenly violated by real violence leaving auds unsure how to respond. Yuri narrates his upbringing in Gothams Little Odessa quarter where he and brother Vitali (Jared Leto) were raised by their Ukrainian emigre parents. Yuri witnesses a mob hit in 1982 and realizes that theres a real demand for guns and bullets -- and cash could be made supplying them. From strictly small-time customers Yuri in almost absurdly quick order brings now-partner Vitali along to the West Berlin arms fair of 1983 where master arms dealer Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm) gives him a one-sentence brush-off ""Im in the business to change governments."" Yuri though is in this business to do business -- a crucial distinction that defines his character for the rest of the film. If ""Lord of War"" makes its most obvious point by decrying the human cost of the global proliferation of arms its subtler point is that in Yuris view selling AK-47s or helicopter gunships is no different from selling refrigerators. Even this is made comic with a slo-mo shot of an automatic machine gun accompanied by the sound of a clinging cash register. Soon Yuri is in charge of illegally registered sea vessels. Charging on board is dogged Interpol agent Valentine (Ethan Hawke) the relentless cat to Yuris mouse for most of the remaining 90 minutes. Editor Zach Staenberg deserves high credit for the films rollicking sense of time and years whizzing by. On his frequent international trips Yuri continually sees a girl from his youth Little Odessa goddess Eva (Bridget Moynihan) now a supermodel. While Vitali gives in to the temptations of cocaine Yuri elaborately arranges to track down Eva and soon has her as his trophy wife in lavish Central Park East digs. Pic shifts to a more troublesome midsection divided roughly between a dull unconvincing set of domestic scenes involving Yuri and Evas parched marriage and Yuris dealings with a bloodthirsty Liberian dictator named Baptiste Senior (Eamonn Walker). Regularly dressed in his ""Reservoir Dogs""-style black suit in a country filled with dead bodies and muddy streets Yuri looks increasingly strange in Liberias mayhem. A sense of doom slowly descends on Yuris character most brilliantly visualized when Valentine catches up with him again in an airborne chase and handcuffs him on the ground of a dusty airfield. Niccols script is finally too much for the film to hold onto. Yuris life globe hopping and two-facedness appear to be more than any one feature could possibly contain. While the Yuri character is never less than fascinating the script struggles with its approach to him. Lost along the way are some potential dramatic anchors such as the father-son dynamic between Weisz and Yuri that seems to be a central story point but is never developed. Nor does Yuri and Vitalis relationship ever ring quite true including a third-act climax that nearly unravels the entire film. Whats missing most in the story is a certain humanity that Cage must provide on his own. He brings a theatrical irony to bear here with brilliance even as his ever-present voice on the soundtrack serves to give texture and dimension -- even if it goes on much too long. By contrast Walker is far too emphatic and one-note Moynihan blander-than-bland and Holm criminally cut short of screentime. Pic looks and feels authentically international with lenser Amir Mokri finding distinct imagery to match Gotham Czech and South African settings. Song selection like much of the humor is a bit too smarty-pants for the films own good.
