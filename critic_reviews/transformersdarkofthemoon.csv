(And did.) The latest installment in the epic tale of good Autobots bad Decepticons and Shia LaBeouf Transformers Dark of the Moon improves on its predecessor in almost every obvious way. (Apart from length that is it clocks in at a brutal 157 minutes.) The plot--which posits that the midcentury U.S.-Russian ""space race"" was actually an effort to recover lost Autobot artifacts from the dark side of the moon--is much sharper. The special effects are more impressive and the action considerably more intense. The movie even manages in stark contrast to such summer duds as Green Lantern and the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie to make effective use of 3D. Yet despite these manifest improvements there is something so sour and unpleasant about the new film that it left me almost nostalgic for the innocent idiocies of its predecessor. As its title hints perhaps unwittingly Dark of the Moon is a journey into the angry adolescent id of director Michael Bay. I for one could not wait to get out. Lets start at the beginning. Following a Kennedy-era prologue the first shot of the movie is a closeup of the barely-pantied bottom of Rosie Huntington-Whitely as she ascends a flight of stairs. This is the second shot as well; the third opting for expository variety shifts to the front and works its way up her torso. Now it is true that Huntington-Whitely has a fine bottom as one might expect from a veteran Broadway character actress former Victorias Secret model. But Bays lens leers so emphatically almost pornographically that this opening cant help but come across as a statement of his philosophy of gender. This is after all the man who fired previous franchise eye candy Megan Fox for being insufficiently sexy which is a bit like firing water for being insufficiently wet. Huntington-Whitely plays Carly the new squeeze of returning hero Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) which means that her narrative functions--apart from a scene near the end in which she goads a Decepticon by calling it a ""bitch""--alternate between being ogled and being held hostage. Its a bit of a challenge to capture just how retrograde the film is on this score. Bay clothes Huntington-Whitely in a series of short dresses and as often as is practical films her from floor level as if his camera were a mirror hidden in the shoelaces of a horny 12-year-old. Early on a pint-sized Autobot fresh from rooting around in her underwear drawer pauses to peer up her skirt; shortly after John Malkovich (in perhaps the most embarrassing performance of his career) tilts his head a full 90 degrees to stare ostentatiously at her ass. In what evidently constitutes a pun these days it is Huntington-Whitely who is center screen when another character commenting on the case a medal came in gushes ""What a gorgeous box."" In keeping with this view of womens proper role--Sartre with whom Bay has more in common than one might imagine would have called it the etre-pour-autrui--the director also supplies us with a pretty Latina who is ushered briefly onscreen to be berated for her ""hoochie"" outfit and a hard-nosed National Intelligence Director (Frances McDormand) whose authority is gradually usurped by a renegade male agent (John Turturro) to the point where she ends up literally across his lap. A few circa-1980s gay gags are thrown in for good measure notably a lisping German named ""Dutch"" (played by the far-too-good-to-accept-such-material Alan Tudyk). But credit where it is due Bay has at least abandoned the outright minstrelsy of streetwise Autobots Mudflap and Skid. (There are two poodle-sized imbecile-bots thrown in for comic effect but they are so to speak race-neutral.) One might argue that this is merely par for the course for Bay and one would not be entirely wrong. Where the director truly begins to break new ground is in the character of Sam who is--how to put this delicately?--an asshole. Gone is the eager All-American boy of the prior movies his enthusiasm curdled into a mixture of entitlement self-pity and belligerence. (Yes he does rather seem to suit the political moment.) As the film opens Sam is unemployed a circumstance he accepts with decidedly less equanimity than he did his near-fatal travails in the previous two films. Hes angry at the employers who dont hire him at the girlfriend who has a good job and at her smarmy boss (Patrick Dempsey) who like everyone else in the film eyes her with undisguised cupidity. Most of all hes angry as he gripes on countless occasions that he hasnt gotten enough credit for already saving the world twice. The Transformers too have gotten surlier since their last outing. In particular the Decepticons all seem to have sprung leaks in their mandibular hinges their mouths ooze slobber and spray with a salivary vehemence that would shock H.R. Giger. I hadnt seen such grotesque machinery since Pontiac discontinued the Aztek in 2005. On the battlefield the brutality has been ramped up considerably with Transformers good and bad alike spattering blood-like fluids as they are stabbed and dismembered. In one scene an especially sanguinary Decepticon announces ""We will kill them all""--no wait thats a quote from Optimus Prime heroic leader of the Autobots. How about the one who screams ""You die"" as he savagely tears through his adversaries? No thats Optimus too. And the bit near the end of the film when someone flamboyantly executes a downed and helpless Transformer with a point-blank shot to the head? You guessed it also Optimus. (The otherwise enthusiastic crowd at the screening I attended seemed a bit taken aback by this with the few half-hearted claps quickly petering out.) The last third or so of Dark of the Moon involves a battle for the city of Chicago that is notable in the extremity of its violence screaming fleeing civilians are blown to bits; the camera glides over toppled buildings and a busload of human corpses. The 9/11 echoes only grow louder once Sam and sundry commandos arrive on the scene--as for instance when our heroes trapped on the upper floors of a smoldering glass-and-steel skyscraper are forced to jump out the windows. One need not consider such freighted imagery sacrosanct to feel that it probably doesnt belong in a movie inspired by a bunch of Hasbro toys. Indeed Bay seems almost completely to have lost interest in the goofy premise undergirding the franchise--that legions of massive extraterrestrial robots would bother disguising themselves as backhoes and muscle cars in the first place. There are a smattering of de rigeur Transformations throughout the movie but in this installment the mechanized protagonists spend less time morphing into mundane vehicles than they do piloting otherworldly ones floating dreadnoughts the size of city blocks; a giant burrowing contraption that looks like a cybernetic sandworm. The latter has stuck with me both as pure visual spectacle--it is a minor triumph of CGI--and as emblematic of the movie as a whole massive inexorable and utterly devoid of humanity.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

By John Anderson July 1 2011 Tom Hanks may not be Americas finest screen actor but hes got statuettes that say otherwise. When he won his back-to-back Best Actor Oscars in 1994 and 1995 for ""Philadelphia"" and ""Forrest Gump"" respectively he became the first actor to do so since Spencer Tracy (in 1937 and 1938) who was always considered the gold standard of classic Hollywood. Mr. Hanks has been compared repeatedly to James Stewart over the course of his three-decade career. Hes a distant relative of Abraham Lincolns mother; he fought long and hard to get a World War II memorial built on the Mall in Washington D.C.; if he were running for something it would be National Treasure. But as difficult as it is to dislike Mr. Hanks it takes no effort to all to develop an aversion toward ""Larry Crowne"" the alleged comedy being perpetrated today by Mr. Hanks; his director Mr. Hanks; his producer Mr. Hanks; and the co-writer Mr. Hanks. It is a distinctly painful experience On one level the story pushes all the Recession-Era buttons--Larry (Mr. Hanks) has been laid off from his managers job at a Wal-Mart-style budget store because he never went to college and he never went to college because he joined the Navy. That the film opens the same week as ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" could only have been a marketing calculation ""Larry"" being intended as the perfect counterprogramming to Hollywoods most callous exercise in soulless commerce. But so little effort has been exerted toward making ""Larry Crowne"" more than a class-warfare cartoon that the film generates its own sense of cynicism and the distinct sense that ""Larry Crowne"" is simply a sop to certain disgruntled theatergoers. Some may see it as a movie that strives to restore emotional warmth and simple human values to a medium that could certainly use a little more of both. But unlike the freshly matriculated Larry himself ""Larry Crowne"" gets a flunking grade in every discipline. Reuniting Mr. Hanks and Julia Roberts for the first time since the grossly underappreciated ""Charlie Wilsons War"" this is the first feature film directed by Mr. Hanks since ""That Thing You Do"" (1996) and establishes Larry immediately as the quintessential U.S. worker Hes enthusiastic hardworking honest cheerful and we have to guess trustworthy brave clean and reverent. Hes the antithesis of the very corporatized ethos that cuts him loose so brutally and nonsensically--since his educational shortcomings mean he cant advance in the company he must therefore be let go. It turns out to be a blessing of course Larry goes to community college where hes introduced to modern America the comic basso profundo of his weirdly disassociated economics professor Dr. Matsutani (""Star Trek"" vet George Takei) and Mercedes Tainot (Ms. Roberts) a leggy professor so weary and disillusioned she seems capable of extinguishing the spark of even the most eager knowledge-hungry student. But not of course Larry Crowne. The script by Mr. Hanks and Nia Vardalos (""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"") is one of those wonders of the cinema You wonder who thought any of this was funny. The fractious scenes between Mercedes and her stay-at-home husband (Bryan Cranston) are painful although they do give Larry the opportunity to provide a romantic palliative. Larrys adoption by a group of younger students--all of whom ride eco-friendly motor scooters--is cloyingly comically clueless; Gugu Mbatha-Raw who plays Larrys style tutor Talia is positively adorable but as directed by Mr. Hanks seems to be auditioning for her own Disney Channel program. The direction is generally awkward and given the coarsely written role Ms. Roberts is assigned to play the burden of charm is placed squarely on Mr. Hanks well-intentioned but sagging shoulders. Even a national monument will collapse under too much pressure. Watch a clip of Paramount Pictures ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"". Transformers Dark of the Moon A black hole of technology talent and time ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" is a symptom of many things chief among them the fact that summer blockbuster movies dont really matter anymore. What matters is the propaganda. The sound and fury surrounding director Michael Bays third Hasbro-inspired sci-fi hallucination has been cranked up to such a volume that no consumer of any media can ignore it and no mere movie can possibly live up to it. And it doesnt matter Audiences wont come to ""Dark of the Moon"" to see it but to have seen it. The hype has outpaced the product. None of which is to say that ""Dark of the Moon"" isnt also a genuinely bad movie. Special effects god love them are intended to bridge the plausible and the fantastic. Yet at virtually no time amid the clinking clanking clattering collection of caliginous junk that rattles through ""Dark of the Moon"" is there the sense that such a gap has been spanned. Certainly there are well-defined worlds created by Mr. Bay and his scores of highly skilled craftsmen and other high-profile personnel (including the prolific producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura and executive producer Steven Spielberg). These include the quasihuman reality of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) the unemployed college grad who cant get a job because he cant tell anyone that hes saved the world two times before. Parallel to Sam is the world of Sams intergalactic allies the mechanically mutating Autobots and their foes the Decepticons who some time earlier destroyed the planet Cybertron and will proceed to do the same to Washington and Chicago. Adjacent to these disparate universes is the world of erstwhile Victorias Secret employee Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who plays Sams girlfriend Carly and represents a species that may have originated on the planet Supermodeltron. And of course theres the action--the gleeful wholesale wanton relentless destruction that reduces entire U.S. cities to smoldering ruins and like Nascar sings the siren song of the morbidly amused. There is however no integration of these various elements no sense of immersion in consolidated fantasy and hence no suspension of disbelief. Hence no emotional engagement. Hence boredom. At 157 minutes ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" isnt just a movie. Its a sentence. ENLARGE The Autobot Bumblebee in Transformers Dark of the Moon. Paramount Pictures Dragooned into the service of this film are not merely the living but the dead. The conceit not a bad one is that the entire NASA space program was established to get to the moon and investigate the crash of an alien spacecraft in 1961 John F. Kennedy disinterred via Mr. Bays computer announces the effort; Richard Nixon similarly resurrected continues it. (The real-life Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin even shows up giving a rather sad validation to the entire enterprise.) What crashed on the moon those years before was a ship carrying the Cybertronian poobah Sentinal Prime (voice of Leonard Nimoy fittingly enough) and the key to world domination. What ensues or re-ensues is a battle led by the series principal Autobot Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) who will go metal-to-metal with the head Decepticon Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving) furthering the ongoing effort to enslave the earth and establish a New Cybertron. Its all so very engaging. And unlike a good story requires too much detail in the telling. Theres barely a spark of humanity in ""Dark of the Moon"" although there are scattered about some very entertaining contributions made by actors not normally associated with alien space epics John Turturro repeating his role as the unctuous Agent Simmons is having his own fine time of it; John Malkovich used sparingly is delightful too. Ms. Huntington-Whitely making her first movie acquits herself admirably enough. You hate to point out how mechanical they are but the worst actors are the robots. One sounds like Bob Hoskins one sounds like the janitor on ""The Simpsons"" and Optimus Prime should he ever retire from the rubble could have a shining future narrating NFL highlight films. ENLARGE Jacob Wysocki as another title character this time in Terri. ATO Terri The disarming original ""Terri"" is a wry low-key comedy from director Azazel Jacobs (""Mommas Man"") that constantly monkeys with our expectations. An overweight loner a goofy sidekick the school siren--you can write the script yourself all about an insecure teenager adrift in a sea of adolescent anguish blahblahblah. And yet thats not quite what happens. Its true that Terri (the terrific touching Jacob Wysocki) has some not-quite-standard-issue problems including a demented uncle (Creed Bratton) absentee parents and a propensity to wear pajamas to school. But Terri also has a sense of himself that belies all the assumptions we make about kids in movies or for that matter kids. He knows hes strange but if someone doesnt like him he assumes its their problem. Hes also generous with his affections When a classmate (Olivia Crocicchia) gets caught in a rather public and compromising position Terri comes to her rescue. The other delight is John C. Reilly who as Terris attentive school principal may finally have found the perfect role for his peculiar and often misdirected gifts. The Perfect Host The less one knows about this perverse thriller from debuting director Nick Tomnay the better; a full appreciation of its delights lies in its revelations. Still it should be noted that baggage can be an advantage David Hyde Pierce who has proven his versatility and range in a number of Broadway successes remains for many that persnickety noodge of TVs ""Frasier"" Niles Crane. And having Niles in your head only makes Mr. Pierces performance as Warwick Wilson richer--a virtuouso turn that requires at least two personalities maybe more. Preparing dinner for an intimate group at his home in the Hollywood Hills Warwick is intruded upon by a fugitive bank robber named John Taylor played by Clayne Crawford who imbues his character with memorably authentic--and psychopathic--desperation. DVD FOCUS Charlie Wilsons War (2007) Its all about timing and the timing was all wrong for this first pairing of Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. Based on a book by George Crile the often hilarious political comedy had a script by Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network"") was directed by Mike Nichols and co-starred Philip Seymour Hoffman (in a flat-out funny performance as a dyspeptic CIA agent). But the subject matter was too volatile In the 1980s the real-life Congressman Wilson had pushed U.S. efforts to aid the same anti-Soviet Afghan rebels who eventually morphed into the Taliban. All of which was bad box-office juju in 2007 and everyone more or less ran away from the movie. But it remains a gem ripe for rediscovery. The War of the Roses (1989) Danny DeVito directed this bleak black comedy starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner about a divorce so harrowing the film might have served as couples therapy. When they decide to part both Barbara Rose (Ms. Turner) and her husband Oliver (Mr. Douglas) decide to keep the house and each begins a campaign to force the other out. How far will they go? The teaser for the movie ""Once in a lifetime comes a motion picture that makes you feel like falling in love all over again. This is not that movie."" The Secret War of Harry Frigg (1968) Paul Newman is the incorrigible U.S. Army private who allows himself to be captured by the Italians during World War II so he can free five captured Allied military bigwigs (French British and American). All the POWs are one-star generals who refuse to take orders from each other; Harry is given two stars so he can wrangle the brass to freedom. Inevitably Harry gets involved with the Italian countess who owns the castle where theyre all being held but he still wins the war. ""Harry"" is perhaps more curiosity than classic but its hard not to be charmed by Mr. Newman. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies The New Transformers Turn On the Dark For good or ill director Michael Bay is the soul of a new machine the poet of post-human cinema the CEO of Hollywoods military-entertainment complex By Richard Corliss June 29 2011 Share Read Later EverettTransformers Dark of the Moon Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The midtown-Manhattan crowd -- real people not movie reviewers except for this one -- stood patiently in line for a 1215 a.m. screening of Transformers Dark of the Moon the third in Michael Bays ear- eye- and block-buster series based on the line of Hasbro robot toys. When the feature began a half hour late the audience showed its fondness for the material by saluting each appearance of the friendly yellow car-bot Bumblebee not with rowdy shouts but with courteous applause as if after a sharp volley at Wimbledon. A few whoops greeted the 3-D IMAX leveling of Chicago. And when the movie ended about an hour before dawn the admirers let out a few decorous cheers. They sounded less like red-meat fanboys than connoisseurs at a wine tasting. The critics reaction has been more tentative. They decried the first Transformers (2007) and its sequel Revenge of the Fallen (2009) which together earned more than 1.5 billion at the worldwide box office. They charged Bay with failing all conventional (perhaps archaic) tests for coherence of storytelling and mise-en-scene. He sends the camera scampering in virtually every shot even those lasting a split second and he seems to think that matching them -- locating a fixed point of view a law that directors have followed since the earliest features -- is for wimps. Reviewers of the first two films got so vexed by Bays eroticized violence his car lust and carnage his nonstop aural and cinematic assaults that they saw his success in apocalyptic terms as the end of movies as we once loved them and the triumph of a virulent new strain robotulism. T3 screenwriter Ethan Kroeger mimics the typical critique of a Bay film when he has John Malkovich as the heros epicurean boss say ""You fall into a life-sucking abyss. Its a visual and therefore visceral betrayal."" With T3 many reviewers have retreated from their previous horrified stance to baffled resignation. Im with them. I acknowledge that for good or ill Bay is the soul of a new machine the poet of post-human cinema the CEO of Hollywoods military-entertainment complex. T3is the movie equivalent of an 80s thrash-metal concert (not Megadeth but Megatron) with bits of spoken exposition inserted into the action scenes like the lead singers mumbled comments between songs. And yes for Bay to give Optimus Prime and the other good Autobots blue eyes and Megatrons evil Decepticons red eyes smacks of aesthetic fascism but in a helpful way how else are novice viewers to tell them apart? Its all part of the directors grand lubricious vision -- what we might call Bay-watch. Plot synopsis Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) blah blah Optimus and Megatron knocking heads again new Autobot named Sentinel (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) secret government project run by a bossy woman (Frances McDormand more or less playing Hillary Clinton if she ran the CIA and if you hate Hillary Clinton) new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley whose generic blond sexiness makes her both a fembot and Playboy Femlin) big bot battle that devastates downtown Chicago (notably the aptly named Wacker Drive) blah blah bring in the U.S. military and somehow let Sam command them to save the world -- if he can first get Carly out of that Decepticon car that is trying to fondle her with its grabby tentacles. To the first two movies clinking clanking clattering collections of caliginous junk T3 adds what has become a go-to staple of Hollywood fantasy the retro-conspiracy theory. Recent films have invented Jews who killed Hitler X-Men who solved the Cuban missile crisis Watchmen who insured a third term for Richard Nixon and two aliens in Paul and Super 8 held captive since the 50s in Area 51. Bays movie plays on suspicions about the U.S. moon landings already voiced in Peter Hyams 1978 Capricorn One and soon to be elaborated on in the speculative horror film Apollo 18. T3 proposes that an alien race the Autobots crash-landed on the moon before we did and that the discovery of the crash stoked Americas Apollo expeditions whose astronauts found the Autobot remnants on the dark side. The real Buzz Aldrin the second man to walk on the moon plays himself either to validate the claim or to pick up what I hope was a fat check for a few days demeaning work. T3 like Super 8 has Steven Spielberg in a guiding producer capacity and his involvement with the two films shows how neatly he has bifurcated aspects of his early films. J.J. Abrams Super 8s writer-director ran variations on the awe and aw-shucks sci-fi tone of Close Encounters and E.T. while Bay updates the monster and destructo-fest elements of Jaws and 1941. When T3 escalates into soldier mode Bay also appropriates bits of Spielbergs Saving Private Ryan and War of the Worlds. But hes an equal-opportunity ransacker of movies. He throws in images of JFK Nixon and Barack Obama a la Zelig and Forrest Gump; stocks his bot bestiary with ""cute"" critters that cross Muppets with Gremlins; gives one of the bad bots a toadying Gollum-like sidekick; borrows Army reconnaissance tropes from The Hurt Locker; convenes a reunion of Coen-brothers cast members McDormand Malkovich and John Turturro; lets The Hangovers Ken Jeong pad his career-long resume of grotesque Asian Americans; and includes nearly as many toy-auto product placements as Cars 2. The Coenheads seem to have enjoyed their payday; and Alan Tudyk registers momentarily as a gay German (all stereotypes intact). But acting is irrelevant in such a venture since it consumes precious seconds of a 2 hr. 37 min. tower of testosterone. Playing on the violent auto-eroticism of American males with their vehicles both as sex objects (adolescence) and as smashable playthings (infancy) T3exists to bump chests and chassis and to blow stuff up. In these endeavors it can be almost enthralling. Youll see a sensational highway chase in which Optimus reconstitutes himself to catch the falling Sam and skydivers in bat-web suits and a skyscraper calamity that is cool enough to evoke the Tower of Pisa more than the World Trade Center on 9/11. Militia types will also enjoy the spectacle at the Lincoln Memorial where Megatron high on power pulverizes the huge sculpture to make room for himself on Abes marble seat. Critics are also irrelevant to Transformers Dark of the Moon. This review isnt meant to send people to the movie or keep them away. In fact the scorekeepers at the various sites that rate critics enthusiasm for a film shouldnt even try to elicit a Pass or Fail grade from me on T3. Im a fascinated stupefied outsider.

"Transformers Dark of the Moon reviewed Michael Bay finally defeats the audience Slate Sign In Sign Up Transformers Dark of the Moon reviewed Michael Bay finally defeats the audience Transformers Dark of the Moon reviewed Michael Bay finally defeats the audience Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 29 2011 436 PM Transformers Dark of the Moon Sooooo many robots. By Dana Stevens After youve seen the movie listen to Dana Stevens and John Swansburgs Spoiler Special about TransformersDark of the Moon or with the player below John Malkovich as Bruce Brazos and Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky in Transformers Dark of the Moon The colossally destructive almost comically long final battle sequence of Michael Bays Transformers Dark of the Moon (Paramount Pictures) culminates in at least a temporary vanquishing of the earth-invading Decepticons by the more human-friendly Autobots. But the entirety of the film stands as proof of robotic lifes inevitable triumph over Homo sapiens. Faced with this quantity of hardware this degree of technical sophistication this goddamn many robots organic life doesnt stand a chance. We might as well amuse ourselves with tales of the war between two fictional robot races now that Michael Bay has taken over the world. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Its been a slow colonization with each of the three successive Transformers films ratcheting up the onslaught. In the first Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) a high-school kid in love with his car discovers that the black-and-yellow Chevy Camaro Bumblebee is really a giant sentient robot from the mechanical planet Cybertron. Sam gets drawn into the war between the planets two exiled races who eventually trash downtown L.A. in their struggle for intergalactic domination. In the second film--well pretty much the same thing happens again except that Sam is now a college kid whos definitively landed his dream girl (Megan Fox who was fired from the franchise after jokingly comparing Bay to Hitler) and the monuments sacrificed to cosmic war are the Great Pyramids. Advertisement With Dark of the Moon Bay takes the more-is-more aesthetic of the first two movies up another several notches. Forget about critic-proof; this movie is critic-obliterating. Its a tank that flattens everything that gets in its way including the audience. There is something awe-inspiring about Bays sheer commitment to scale--augmented now by that state-of-the-art anti-audience weapon 3-D. But marveling at its grotesque gigantism doesnt make this two-and-a-half-hour-long movie any less dull. The dullness kicks in almost immediately after the appealingly loopy cold open which posits a paranoid alternate version of the moon landing. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have secretly been sent to investigate an alien spacecraft thats crashed on the lunar surface. (The real Aldrin appears in a cameo later in the film somewhat surprisingly given the astronauts history of run-ins with moon-landing conspiracy theorists.) The crafts occupant is Sentinel Prime (voiced pleasingly by Leonard Nimoy) an aged Autobot leader thought dead in the war that destroyed their planet. The alien is brought back to Earth where he eventually meets up with his successor Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen whos been voicing this character ever since his early days as a TV-cartoon hero.). After some nattering about who should possess the Matrix of Leadership (which is not a managerial manual but a kind of airborne power-conferring crystal) the two Primes join forces to foil what has to be one of the worst-thought-through evil schemes in movie-villain history something about towing the planet Cybertron close to Earth and enslaving the human population to rebuild it as if it were an offshore oil rig? Optimus Prime in Transformers Dark of the Moon Sam now a recent college graduate has been unable to find a job so hes living off the ample salary (and other ample gifts) of his English girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley a Victorias Secret model whose blank moue recalls Guess? Jeans model and onetime Mickey Rourke paramour Carre Otis). Carly works for a car-collecting billionaire (Patrick Dempsey) who may have even more nefarious plans afoot than just stealing Sams girlfriend. John Malkovich Ken Jeong Josh Duhamel John Turturro and Frances McDormand also mill in and out as ... people who react to the giant battling robots and less often to one anothers lines. Call me carbon-based but I cant for the life of me keep straight which of the warring vehicle-based automatons is which Megatron Starscream Ironside Ratchet the millionaire his wife. (Do female machines exist on the planet Cybertron? Never mind; dont answer that.) These massive machines duke it out in the foreground while tiny people--some in high-tech wingsuits some in high heels and tight jeans--scurry through the wreckage at their feet. The endless action climax includes a falling-skyscraper scene that casually plunders 9/11 for visual references (floating scraps of paper falling office chairs) without paying the obligatory tax of pathos or political allegory such scenes usually demand. At one point a character refers to downtown Chicago where the alien battle is taking place as ""Ground Zero."" Ten years after the fall of the Twin Towers the attack like the moon landing has become a source of stock historical references. Occasionally a nifty action idea bobs to the surface like some business involving the leads slide down the outside of a sharply canted glass building. (In this movie even a brief nod to the laws of physics counts as subtlety.) But everything is soon pounded to rubble under the Volkswagen-sized fists of Bays mechanized heroes and villains. Somewhere deep into the perhaps 40-minute-long crescendo of action that ends this movie I began to experience a dazed sense of submission a cowed respect for our new CGI overlords. Other sci-fi franchises--the Terminator series most notably--pit vulnerable but canny humans against soulless time-traveling robots in a struggle for supremacy. Transformers takes the struggle to the next posthuman level. On Earth as on Cybertron and certainly at the box office the robots have already won.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post If friend James Cameron is the King of the World Michael Bay shall be known henceforth as the Earl of Excess. His latest exploit ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" starring Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky longtime friend of the extraterrestrial Autobots has no shortage of more more more (how do you like it how do you like it?) Bay is the guy who after all had a yellow Hummer plow through a Cuban barrio in ""Bad Boys II."" This occurred in a movie that already had one of the best over-the-top car chases committed to celluloid. It was brazen. But then no one pays honor to and tops Michael Bay quite like Michael Bay. It was also a bit crass if you thought too much about it -- though thinking has never made a Bay movie better. Overload is what he does for good and ill. More coherent and more playful than 2009s critically reviled phenomenally attended sequel ""Revenge of the Fallen"" this third installment finds Sam in Washington D.C. LaBeouf the franchises central asset can play soulful and cocky. At the same time. This doesnt always make Sam the nicest hero but it makes him something better believable in the most extraordinary circumstances. And once you pin a franchise on toys you have plenty of opportunities. Sams got a new girlfriend Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is this years model Carly. Seriously. In her first movie role the British model -- known for her Victorias Secret work -- is introduced to audiences via her gams. Even with that long-limbed love Sams stewing. He cant land a job but his mechanical pals the Autobots are fighting the good fight. Alas bad is on the horizon. Decepticon Megatron (Hugo Weaving) broods and plots. Hes aided by allies a metal bird-like assassin and Shockwave a serpentine destroyer. The title refers to a spaceship wreck on the moon that took place in 1962. Yep the Autobots beat the U.S. and the Soviets to that lunar landing. And ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" -- written by Ehren Kruger -- makes promiscuous use of the historical. Theres footage of JFK and Nixon and Barack Obama. It makes for an odd mix that hits notes of clever arrogant and lazy repurposing the big stuff for this trivial pursuit. Still the gangs all here Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) Sams best bot Bumble Bee and the other refugees from from the civil-war ravaged Cybertron. Lt. Col. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) is on the case as is USAF Chief Robert Epps (Tyrese Gibson). New faces include Patrick Dempsey as Dylan Carlys handsome well-financed boss. John Malkovich is hilarious as Sams first boss. Oscar winner Frances McDormand portrays Mearing head of national security. She wears nicely tailored suits and stomps around barking orders. Women (even one who runs the show) get short shrift to match their short ensembles. For moviegoers who equate minutes with moneys worth ""Dark of the Moon"" will be a bargain. It runs a smidge over two-and-half hours. The finale is an ongoing assault on Chicago and the senses. The final-battle act of ""Dark of the Moon"" has FX that are jaw-dropping but its relentless and a little dulling. ""Uncle"" we cried long before the predictable resolution. Like Nathans Famous hotdog-scarfing contest on Coney Island (also this holiday weekend) Bay is all about stuffing as much into the gullet as possible. Of course one can argue that summer is built for spectacle. Now if only it could be truly spectacular too.

"Review Transformers Dark of the Moon not as bad as the last one - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Viadeo Review Transformers Dark of the Moon not as bad as the last one By Tom Charity Special to CNN Shia LaBeouf stars in the latest installment of the ""Transformers"" series which Tom Charity says kids will love. STORY HIGHLIGHTSTransformers Dark of the Moon is the third movie in the franchiseThe film stars Shia LaBeouf and a newcomer British model Rosie Huntington-WhiteleyReviewer says ""its a lousy movie"" though better than Transformers 2 RELATED TOPICS Transformers Shia LaBeouf Movies Movie Reviews Entertainment (CNN) -- This time last year we saw a lot of excited articles about how ""Inception"" showed there was an audience for a smarter more conceptual blockbuster. But hold the front page Michael Bay is out to prove theres a bigger audience for brainless bombast and nonstop mayhem. Even Bay now admits hes set himself a very low bar but yes its true what you may have heard ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" is an improvement on ""Revenge of the Fallen."" Its a lousy movie but at least its a lousy movie with a serviceable story killer CGI and an action climax that goes on forever (at least an hour). An awful lot of people like that kind of thing -- my kids included. Like ""X-Men First Class"" the latest Transformers movie goes in for a spot of fantastical sixties revisionism. Screenwriter Ehren Kruger reimagines the Space Race as a covert response to Autobots on the moon and Bay audaciously drafts in Presidents Kennedy and Nixon as well as Neil Armstrong and even Buzz Aldrin in the flesh to sell this appealingly lunatic conspiracy theory. Forty years later the Decepticons snare a devious trap that touches on Chernobyl corrupt accountancy firms aging teen Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his new ""world class hottie"" Carly (British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). The scripts bold outlines dont play so well on a bald scene-by-scene basis. Krugers dialogue leaves even such experienced professionals as Frances McDormand and John Malkovich high and dry and Bay seems to have no interest in reining in the performances of John Turturro or Ken Jeong whose manic mugging is more surreal than comic. Comedy which relies on timing and nuance remains Bays most glaring deficiency though no one seems to have pointed this out to him. That and a sensibility thats still essentially adolescent in its puerile sexism and homophobia. As for Huntington-Whiteley she makes Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep. At least Bay has reconsidered his signature chop suey editing style to adapt to 3-D. The cutting may not be coherent (theres a neat bit involving some skydivers but quite where they land is a mystery) but the pacing is more measured and this is one of the relatively rare blockbusters where the third dimension enhances the experience giving crunch and punch to the numerous bot battles. Whats more Bay has put the gargantuan budget on screen. Hes an unabashed maximalist. Before hes through hes poked fun at a third president (Obama) and decapitated a fourth (the Lincoln Memorial) hes trashed downtown Chicago and pulled in not one not two but three worlds for extra oomph. The relentless climax practically batters you into submission. The CGI is more extensive and more textured than in the previous films and Kruger has come up with a couple of authentically dramatic scenes for the Autobots. But if Bay is hands-off with his human actors hes even less interested in his eponymous stars. And thats been the big problem with these ""Transformers"" flicks all along -- the mounting suspicion that Michael Bay finds such kids stuff beneath him. He doesnt ""get"" the Transformers has no interest in kids and so he defaults to what he is good at which is blowing everything up. And the kids love him for it.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 29 2011 Save for later Saved Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky in a scene from Transformers Dark of the Moon. Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Sitting through 2009s ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" remains for me one of the signal bad experiences Ive ever had at the movies and thats not even counting the jumbo Coke some patron accidentally spilled on me. Given this history I was fully steeled for Michael Bays 3-D follow-up ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" the third in this torture chamber of a movie franchise. I gave myself strict ground rules Look away from the screen whenever the sensory overload is playing racquet ball with your neural circuits and clap your ears whenever they threaten to fry. Also dont even think about following the story line which is nonexistent anyway and just pray that you walk out of the movie as a reasonable facsimile of the person who walked into it.Having survived sort of the new ""Transformers"" I heartily recommend my ground rules to anybody in similar straits - which includes I would imagine anybody above the age of 9. If you dont know the difference between an Autobot and a Decepticon - and after 154 minutes of this assaultive movie Im still not entirely sure - then steer clear. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Shia LaBeouf is back as Sam Witwicky who at least is human (I think). His girlfriend formerly played by Megan Fox has been replaced by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley a plush-lipped Victoria Secret model with elocutionary skills somewhat below Judi Denchs. Even though Sam received a medal from President Obama for saving the world (c.f. previous installment) he cant find a job in Washington D.C. - further proof that the recession isnt over. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Meantime the Decepticons have their sights set on taking over Earth especially Chicago while good-guy Autobots (and theyre all guys by the way) are aligned with us humans to defend truth justice and the American way. Except that some of the good bots morph into bad bots and vice versa. The bots all come color-coded for easy parsing of goodness and badness - Megatron for example is black while Optimus Prime is red and blue - but this doesnt help much when wars erupt and shards start flying. The unending ""Transformers"" mania courtesy of Hasbro began with the 1980s TV show and comics and toys. There must be something primal going on to explain its longevity. World-class marketing perhaps? Whatever the cause the movies do not signal as some have reasonably suggested the death of civilization as we know it although they surely signal the death of movies with any kind of coherence.The only saving grace is that this time around the script (yes there is one and it was concocted by Ehren Kruger) has occasional wisps of lucidity and Bay delivers - overdelivers - on the mayhem. Hes one of those directors who is more at home with gizmos than with people which obviously stands him in good stead in Hollywood these days.Fine actors like John Turturro and John Malkovich are encouraged to strip-mine the scenery. Frances McDormand playing a government bigwig can now rest content knowing she has given the worst performance of her career. (Not her fault either.) Bay cant even get Buzz Aldrin to perform credibly and hes playing himself. Aldrins appearance by the way is linked to the films notion that the 1969 moon landing was actually a sidebar to a big war between good and bad bots on the dark side of the moon. (Memo to Hollywood There is no such thing as the dark side of the moon just the far side of the moon.) So maybe a subset of this films core audience can be added 9-year-old conspiracy theorists. Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for intense prolonged sequences of sci-fi action violence mayhem and destruction and for language some sexuality and innuendo.)

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet So wait has Michael Bay actually been listening to his detractors? As difficult as that is to believe given the director/producers legendary arrogance (and massive box-office success) his third Transformers movie suggests hes actually taken some of the backlash to heart. Gone are the embarrassing racial stereotypes and crass body-parts humor. The slapstick and humiliation comedy have been dialed down to token levels. Theres a competent authoritative female character (a high-ranking government functionary briskly played by Frances McDormand) and a competent authoritative African-American hero (Tyrese Gibson revisiting his character from the first two movies but as a leader instead of a comedic second banana). Many of the action scenes are coherent enough to follow with the naked eye. And while the female lead (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley stepping in for the banished Megan Fox) is alternately a bimbo a shrew and a princess-in-peril at least the film treats her sexuality frankly without fetishizing sniggering or cringing from it. Its as though Bay has upgraded his ideal audience from 13-year-old boys to 18-year-old boys. That said Transformers Dark Of The Moon is still a wearyingly overlong series of battles and explosions with the thinnest of connective tissue and an ADD-esque disregard for follow-through. The plot concerns a game-changing piece of Autobot technology that crash-landed on the moon in the 1960s and must now be recovered before the Decepticons get it but as with the previous Transformers movies plot isnt the point Any stated character goal is either rapidly dealt with dramatically reversed or turned into an action setpiece so protracted that by the time it resolves its difficult to remember where it began. While the first 90 minutes is a blur of ancillary characters (including Communitys Ken Jeong inducing gay panic in nominal hero Shia LaBeouf in a bathroom stall Fireflys Alan Tudyk poncing about with a silly accent and Patrick Dempsey as a boor so rich hes apparently commandeered the Milwaukee Art Museum as his private garage) and unnecessary business (including the de rigueur LaBeouf troubled romance) the film eventually settles down to its primary business of blowing up downtown Chicago at great length and in great detail. And once it finally does Transformers Dark Of The Moon is solidly mindless breathless summer fun. While virtually all the action sequences either go on far too long or cut out abruptly in the middle as if Bay suddenly lost interest theyre at least creatively staged and eye-poppingly imagistic. While it would be nice to care at all about the people bouncing around inside all the CGI mayhem by now anyone going to a Michael Bay movie should know better. At this point its enough that the most egregiously offensive and creepy content has been disposed of leaving explosion-lovers of all colors genders and national origins to enjoy their atavistic violence without feeling personally insulted.

Filmgoers will wish the soldiers had battled director Michael Bay instead.       Photo Robert Zuckerman FILM STILL Transformer 3 stills (Robert Zuckerman) So Harold Camping got a few details about the Rapture wrong. The Apocalypse arrives today in the form of ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" a movie guaranteed to strike worldwide audiences deaf and dumb with a cunning combination of a brain-dead script lousy 3-D ADD-addled edits a pneumatic underwear model and a lot of things blowing up very very loudly. Director Michael Bay Hollywoods answer to the Antichrist isnt primarily interested in your soul though his movie does a pretty effective job of sucking that away (and sucking in general). PHOTOS ROSIE HUNTINGTON-WHITELEY His primary goal is separating you from 15 dollars (in 3-D) for the privilege of watching a mainstream movie thats only slightly easier to follow -- and 16 minutes longer -- than the art-house hit ""The Tree of Life"" and many many many decibels louder. I miraculously survived a preview screening with a throbbing headache and slight nausea; others may not be so lucky. Hes a seductive devil that Bay. Hes all but renounced this movies appalling 2009 predecessor and publicly promised that this one pays attention to such niceties as characterization. And Bay claims hes curbed his propensity for microsecond-long cuts to accommodate 3-D which requires more time for your eyes to register an image. He further asserts that the 3-D is brighter and sharper than in other films using the process. Dont believe him. To use the technical terminology of my profession thats hooey hooey and more hooey. Bay and credited screenwriter Ehren Kruger (""Reindeer Games"") tease us with a pre-credits sequence revealing that President Nixons biggest cover-up wasnt Watergate after all. When the US landed on the moon in 1969 the astronauts covertly recovered a crashed spaceship on the far side. After a baffling visit to deserted present-day Chernobyl by US troops led by Josh Duhamel were in Washington DC where our hero Sam (Shia LaBeouf) is unemployed after receiving a medal from President Obama. But he still has the hottest girlfriend in town. Shes played by thigh-flashing Victorias Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley whose ""acting"" makes her fired predecessor Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep by comparison. The promised ""characterization"" consists of painful hamming from such fine actors as Frances McDormand (""You cant just bring weapons of mass destruction into our atmosphere"") John Malkovich and John Turturro. And then theres a beyond-stupid scene in which Sam is caught in a compromising position in the mens room with Ken Jeong the Asian-stereotype specialist of ""Hangover"" fame. Patrick Dempsey also chews all available scenery as the chief human bad guy. Dr. McDreamy is not only the models employer and would-be boyfriend but also serves as the public-relations counselor for an army of Decepticons -- the bad Transformers -- launched from that long-ago moon landing (I think). President Obama is so cowed by the Decepticons that he exiles Optimus Prime and the rest of the good-guy Autobots from Earth -- till the Decepticons demolish the Lincoln Memorial. Thats merely a prelude to Bay and the Decepticons laying waste to Chicago for something like 40 minutes. I had no idea why they were doing this or why soldiers would want to rappel down the side of a collapsing glass skyscraper. It may look cool but this defies all laws of physics and logic. Fortunately -- or unfortunately depending upon your point of view -- this sequence puts Huntington-Whiteley in form-fitting jeans that dont afford the ogling upskirt views in her earlier scenes. She registers terror at being menaced by Decepticons with all the conviction of a young woman whos been told shell have to wait another 10 minutes for her manicure. Thats probably irrelevant in a movie so confusingly frenetic that it looks like it was edited by a 5-year-old after consuming three bowls of LSD-laced Capn Crunch. At the screening I was at many shots were so dim that I frequently had to remove my 3-D glasses to determine whether it was supposed to be day or night. Between the 3-D and the assaultive noise level -- lots of metal-on-metal action and explosions -- I felt my brain had been rewired by the end of 21/2 hours. Box-office experts predict the much-hyped flick will lure teens who have largely deserted movie theaters this year. Thats entirely possible and would in some ways represent the End of Days for Hollywood filmmaking as we know it. But then the prognosticators might be as wrong as Camping -- ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" could underperform serving as the final nail in the coffin for the waning 3-D format. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Jennifer Lopez joins cast of What to Expect When You...

"Transformers Dark of the Moon Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-TransformersMovie review Transformers Dark of the MoonExcellent 3-D and a sense of fun make this entry considerably more watchable than Michael Bays last outing.June 29 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Shia LaBeouf and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in ""Transformers Dark... (Robert Zuckerman / Paramount...)""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" the third installment of director Michael ""Boom Boom"" Bays clash of the mechanized morphing Cybertron titans is surprisingly minimalist in an ear-splitting bone-rattling maximus way. Dont get me wrong the franchise remains as much an endurance test as a movie but at least a better Bay has delivered a leaner meaner cleaner 3-D rage against the machines. By showing a measure of restraint and using 3-D to excellent effect Bay finally enables the Transformers to emerge as players in their own right with hopes and dreams declaiming their philosophies of fate humankind and the universe in grand Shakespearean style. There are other upgrades as well. Shia LaBeouf is back as Autobots confidant Sam Witwicky though that smoking yellow classic Camaro that hid Bumblebee has mostly deserted him. Its been interesting to watch LaBeouf as well as Sam kind of grow up in the role. The actors toughened up nicely as a recently minted college grad with a ""but I saved mankind"" chip on his job-hunting shoulder. Even with the added edge and all the jams Sam and the rest of the cast get themselves into theres a sense that everyone is having a lot more fun in ""Moon."" Frances McDormand as the prickly head of national security and John Turturro reprising his crazed former intelligence agent seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves as former colleagues who possibly did a little ""undercover"" spying back in the day. All of which makes ""Dark of the Moon"" considerably more watchable than the last ""Transformers"" outing a which is the very definition of a low bar. Screenwriter Ehren Kruger flying solo this time around plants a flag in the conspiracy theories swirling around the first moon landing in 69 throwing in a NASA cover-up. There is a clever cameo by elder astronaut statesman Buzz Aldrin to give credence to what happened and the whole ""event"" provides a reason to introduce another ancient warrior this one with Cybertron mettle in Sentinel Prime (voiced by an unmistakable Leonard Nimoy). It also sets up the showdown between Optimus and the Autobot good guys and those devilish Decepticons which is the spine of the plot and ""Transformers"" raison detre always. To lead that charge the filmmakers have brought back most of the Transformers fighting front line led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullens booming baritone) special-forces hunk Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and righteous renegade Epps (Tyrese Gibson). Of course the guy with the really big guns is Bay. Hes armed to the teeth but stripping down his battles between the metal giants to more one-on-one action that even non-Transformer fanatics can follow. There are wars to wage and cities (mainly Chicago) to destroy but lets not forget the love story which provides the necessary eye candy for fanboys piece of the equation. Sams current girlfriend Carly is played by British up-and-stunner Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who delivers just as convincing a pillowy pout as Megan Fox did (the actress unable or unwilling to rebound from her spat with the filmmaker). Patrick Dempsey more McDreary than McDreamy here shows up as a too-slick mogul with a penchant for fast cars and Carlys curves. Driving the mayhem as usual are the Decepticons with Megatron (Hugo Weaving sounding as ominous as ever) plotting a comeback coup after that embarrassing setback in 2009s ""Revenge of the Fallen."" That the world is once again under siege is good news for Sam whos already bored working for a tanning salon-toasted John Malkovich funny and nearly orange in the split second of screen time hes given. Its also good news for us because you dont go to ""Transformers"" for the character or the plot you go for metal-crushing sensory-overloading action. Between Bays obsession to make his 3-D matter and the artistry of the special effects legions amassed for the project the visual payoff is striking. The individual character articulation is so finely rendered we can actually see the complexity of the robots construction as they morph from the ordinary a car plane or whatever a into their towering mechanized essence. But the action sequences while cutting a spectacular path of destruction go on far too long (an ongoing ""Transformers"" issue) including the final pitched battle which displays dazzling firepower but extends for roughly an hour. As always the heart of the film is in the hands of Sam and the machines while Bay mans the battering ram. And for anyone who makes it through to the bitter end really I think certificates of completion are in order. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com Transformers Dark of the Moon MPAA rating PG-13 for intense prolonged sequences of sci-fi violence mayhem and destruction and for language some sexuality and innuendo Running time 2 hours 34 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTransformers Age of Extinction trailer shows robots...March 5 2014Scene-by-scene preview Transformers ride at Universal...November 30 2011Transformers ride to debut at Universal Studios Hollywood...July 29 2011On the Set Michael Bay prepares the new model...May 1 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTTransformersOptimus PrimeAutobotsCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-transformers-20110629,0,7931217.story?track=rss",200,transformersdarkofthemoon13,transformersdarkofthemoon,latimes

In the opening 75 of its 151 minutes this happens Apollo 11 Walter Cronkite Neil Armstrong Presidents Kennedy Nixon and Obama Buzz Aldrin (in the flesh) the Middle East Chernobyl African Savanna Shia LaBeouf Frances McDormand John Malkovich Patrick Dempsey Autobots Decepticons Bill OReilly John Turturro Hermes Birkin bags the Department of Health and Human Services and something called the Ark. The only restraint Bay exercises is not playing ""We Didnt Start the Fire -- and thats only because for him itd be untrue. He more than starts a fire. He concocts a climactic war that flattens downtown Chicago. Bay is such a little boys director. You know he picked that city because its the one with the best rock-em-sock-em street names. Wacker WabashIn this new Transformers installment -- were calling it ""Toy Story 3 at my house -- Bay takes ""all over the map to new extremes. Apparently Armstrong returned to Earth with a trinket crucial to the evil Decepticons master plan. (Says Neil ""My God its some sort of giant metal face) That moon-landing sequence is chased with a shot of a nearly nude derriere ascending a staircase (two moons). It belongs to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley a blonde English fashion model who holds her close-ups the way some coeds hold their beer She looks seasick. Which explains why her hair is often swept to one side. Its in case she needs help in the ladies room. Bays a good girlfriend that way -- one whose preference to clothe Huntington-Whiteley in minidresses and scoop-necks signifies a good girlfriend with ulterior motives. Shes a replacement for Megan Fox who is Judi Dench by comparison.The last half hinges on her rescue from an diabolically coiffed race-car obsessive (Dempsey) and again its the sort of cheesy heroism that only a man with an adolescents libido would risk his life to perform. Not to mention the lives of the troops backing him.But LaBeouf is highly physical and crowd-pleasingly jerky as the little man and the fanchises centerpiece Sam Witwicky. If all Tom Cruise consumed were juice boxes of Red Bull LaBoeuf is who hed be. Hes over-supported. Doing most of the talking in Transformers voices are Leonard Nimoy and as the Peterbilt truck and leader of the Autobots Peter Cullen. McDormand Turturro Malkovich (toothy tan and wonderfully terrible) Julie White Kevin Dunn Ken Jeong and Alan Tudyk take none of this seriously. Thats Bays job.This is big fun if you dont know or dont care about all that the movie connects to from September 11 2001 to the Nazi occupation of Europe. Bay of course gets to play great liberator. Dame Fox was reportedly fired for comparing him in the press to Hitler. I imagine Bay fancies himself a General Patton. ""Dark of the Moon is more of his jingo porn. Those unaroused by Huntington-Whiteley will suffer internal erotic combustion over the revving motors heavy metal heavier artillery and military muscle.As usual some of the egregiousness is mind-blowing bodies sliding down the glass of a perilously canted skyscraper say. And for the first time the Transformers themselves are almost beautiful to behold. Meanwhile the airborne shots over Chicago more than justify the 3-D glasses.""Dark of the Moon is actually movie enough for 10 summers. Bays self-satisfaction at that achievement leaves distressingly little room for an emotional response to say all the dead bodies and human skulls we see. He isnt simply great-directing per se. Hes competing in the Nathans Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest.The more action sequences locations actors historical events machines effects monosyllables weapons and American-flag close-ups the movie shoves in its mouth and ours the less were able to taste. Thats perfect for a director who continues to lack that sense.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

Firefly the newly installed leader of Freedonia receives a report from the Treasury Department. ""I hope youll find it clear"" says the minister of finance. ""Clear?"" replies Firefly incredulously. ""Why a 4-year-old child could understand this report."" Then he pauses for a beat ""Now run out and find me a 4-year-old child. I cant make head or tail of it."" Grouchos joke gets at the terrible paradox of Michael Bays Transformers movies now at three and counting Theyre built around a line of childrens toys -- and presumably appeal to the 4-year-old in all of us -- yet their mythology and their aesthetic are nearly beyond adult comprehension. And that may be the idea Bays hyperaggressive brand of juvenilia pumps sensation to the brain like a half-dozen hair dryers overloading the same circuit. Once the lights go out in your head hes got you. Forming a strange continuity with this summers X-Men First Class which integrated the ""mutants"" into a shadow history of the Cuban Missile Crisis Transformers Dark of the Moon turns to its own 60s event by adding another conspiracy theory to the Apollo 11 landing. Back in 1961 the tortured narration explains the freedom-loving Autobots having nearly lost their home planet Cybertron to the tyrannical Decepticons launched an Ark containing basic technology that could save their kind. But its carrier the Autobot leader Sentinel Prime wound up crashing on the moon. And thus we learn the real reason behind John F. Kennedys initiative to send a man to the moon to investigate a fallen alien spacecraft. So far so comic-booky good. Then we cut to the present day and things get considerably more muddled. The Decepticons have a plan to use sophisticated ""pillars"" to teleport more of their kind to Earth; the Autobots those loyal protectors of mankind are being blamed -- not unfairly -- for bringing trouble to the planet; and Sam Witwicky the put-upon hero played by Shia LaBeouf has another thin rationale for getting caught up in the globe-spanning fight between giant space robots. (He also has a new girlfriend to replace the exiled Megan Fox. Making her screen debut Victorias Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley never stops posing like an animated bus-stop billboard.) i Rosie Huntington-Whiteley a Victorias Secret model making her film debut replaces Megan Fox as the franchises eye candy of choice. Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Pictures Rosie Huntington-Whiteley a Victorias Secret model making her film debut replaces Megan Fox as the franchises eye candy of choice. Jaimie Trueblood/Paramount Pictures Ehren Krugers script incorporates other factions as well including a U.S. military-industrial complex imported from a Coen Brothers movie (Frances McDormand John Turturro and John Malkovich are among the powerful) Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson as iron-jawed soldiers Patrick Dempsey as an oily luxury car dealer and more intrigue between good robots and bad robots than was strictly necessary. All roads lead to the ravaged streets of Chicago where the Autobots and the Decepticons square off in a battle royale that chews up what feels like seven hours of screen time. For fans of the Transformers series -- and judging by the numbers there must be some beyond Golden Raspberry voters -- perhaps each installment is like a snowflake with subtle distinctions that separate one from another. But like the last entry Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Transformers Dark of the Moon demonstrates the problem with sequels to wildly successful bad movies The filmmakers are eager to bottle the same anti-magic that pummeled audiences the first (and second) time around. That means more leering shots of hot cars and hot women the absurd gravitas of a military propaganda film the ""comic relief"" robots with foreign accents and an editing style thats either legitimately avant-garde or timed to the wing-flaps of a deranged hummingbird. Shot by shot Transformers Dark of the Moon like all of Bays work has a meticulous commercial sheen thats distinctive and beautiful but he never lingers on any one of them for long and they rarely make sense in sequence. The climactic showdown in Chicago for example sets up simple enough goals for the opposing sides but its never clear where the Autobots the Decepticons and the U.S. military are in relation to one another or how near or far they are to achieving their respective goals. Its just open-ended chaos a noisy fusillade of expensive effects that pop off like the grand finale of a July 4 celebration. And for Bay that seems entirely by design.

But the biggest casualties in this third installment of the robot franchise from director Michael Bay are storytelling and character development. Two of the fundamental elements of moviemaking feel like tiresome relics in this latest-greatest effort in what may best be described as a post-movie movie.Its no surprise that the third Transformers is all about creating the biggest loudest most visually overwhelming spectacle that money and computers can create. That emphasis is so pre-emptively complete that it seems pointless to observe that the story is muddled and poorly told or that the human characters are absurd and one-dimensional. It would be like going to a demolition derby and complaining about the obvious plot or the lack of dialogue.At least at a demolition derby you wouldnt have to endure frequent breaks in the action for dreary scenes in which characters you dont believe in talk about feelings you dont care about. If only Transformers Dark of the Moon could just be a seamless stream of action. No story just boom pow crash and all that great eye candy.Bay and screenwriter Ehren Kruger set up this third chapter of a world based on a toy line and animated TV show with a prologue that repurposes the Apollo moon missions as part of a government cover-up. Using archival clips of JFK Nixon and NASA we learn that an Autobot spaceship crashed on the moon and America was racing the Soviet Union to get there first. This leads to the latest battle between the Autobots (good) and the Decepticons (evil) with the fate of humans and Earth caught in the middle.In the meantime Bay still has to perform the chores of traditional moviemaking which means providing some human-scale characters and storytelling -- sigh. Shia LaBeouf is back as Sam Witwicky the long-suffering young man whose best friend is an Autobot named Bumblebee. With Megan Fox dismissed as Sams love interest between the last movie and this one she has been replaced by Victorias Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who plays Carly a spectacular goddess unaccountably devoted to Sam. Bays camera spends an inordinate amount of time on her and plainly Sam and Carlys enduring love is intended to be the emotional hook that anchors the movies spectacle-in-overdrive action. It doesnt and as the movie rushes from one battle scene to the next its clear that Bay and company either dont care or dont think it matters. Ditto the utterly ridiculous side plot involving Patrick Dempsey as Sams rival for Carlys affection.At longer than two hours Transformers is punishing. Its long and full of scenes that could have been cut for example the entire subplot involving John Malkovich as a corporate overlord. Its an odd performance that serves no purpose other than minor comic relief. Add him to the list of talented actors taking part in this anti-actors (and really anti-human) movie. At least John Turturro returning as a mad-genius conspiracist and Frances McDormand playing a hilariously stern CIA director seem to be having fun.The action sequences are amazing. The star of this show is the twisting coiling serpent-like Decepticon that tears through the streets of Chicago. In the movies show-stopping scene it destroys a high-rise by roaring through and around the building and squeezing it like a boa constrictor would. Unfortunately Bay continues his practice of churning out action scenes so frantic and frenetic that keeping track of whats going on or where you are in any particular moment is demanding and inevitably unrewarding work.Transformers Dark of the MoonC Starring Shia LaBeouf Rosie Huntington-Whiteley John Turturro Frances McDormand Patrick Dempsey and John Malkovich.

Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky in Transformers Dark of the Moon. Photo Paramount Pictures Transformers Dark of the Moon 1 / 1 Back to Gallery T ransformers Dark of the Moonwill not solve the worlds most pressing problems but it does blow stuff up really well. Its urban devastation knows no peer. Robots smash into each other with steely ferocity and the humans -- why the humans do a fine job providing comic relief. And the product placement The best Ive seen in ages. As a movie based on a line of Hasbro toys this beats out G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra by a long shot. All in all big fat brainless entertainment from director Michael Bay (and writer Ehren Kruger) who takes his trademark cinematic excess to bold new heights of distended self-parody. I mean lows. I mean is there a difference in a movie like this? Keep in mind I happen to be one of three or four people in the English-speaking world who liked the last Transformers sequel and said so in print. Subtitled Revenge of the Fallen it was widely derided as one of the worst cinematic efforts in the history of the art form. I regarded it instead as a loud and rather stupid battling-giant-robot movie but one with a certain testosterone-drenched entertainment value. Ever since Ive been informed by irate readers that I am a bonehead. Who knows maybe I am. Ones opinions do evolve so there may come a time when I start flaming myself anonymously for a 2-year-old review. In the meantime Dark of the Moon is more of the same. Mounds and mounds more. Its even longer even louder even more ridiculous fries even more synapses includes (by rough estimate) some 87531 more explosions and was filmed in glorious 3-D. And nope Im not using ""glorious"" sarcastically. The effects are sensational; Ive never had such fun watching puny humans get tossed around like bean sprouts. The chief toss-ee is Shia LeBeouf as Sam Witwicky the nattering man-boy who allied with the Autobots (good robots from the planet Cybertron) to save Earth from Decepticons (bad robots from etc. etc.) in the first two movies. He finds himself in similar circumstances once again as colorful Transformers morph from race cars and semi trucks and office printers in the battle to claim the remnants of a lost Cybertronian technology that crashed on the dark side of the moon in the early 1960s. This very event sparked the U.S.-Soviet space race - bet you didnt know that. Bay trots out the real Buzz Aldrin to prove it. The historical revisionism is a new twist. So is the addition of several new cast members including Patrick Dempsey as a smarmy car collector; John Malkovich as an eccentric corporate exec with no real point; Ken Jeong as a shrill (what else) office worker; and the voice of Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime the Autobots metal-bearded eminence grise. (Sharp-eared nerds should pick out the nods to Star Trek.) Sams arm candy is gone out with Megan Fox in with pouty British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Another newcomer is Shockwave a burrowing Decepticon that looks like a Kraken crossed with a plumbers snake crossed with Parallax from Green Lantern. He (it?) becomes more prominent as the film (ad?) progresses from the goofball quippery of the first 90-odd minutes to the deadly serious Battle Chicago ruination of the last 55. Bay provides his usual Bayisms bloated close-ups manly slo-mo visual hyperbole and glamour shots of a hot babe standing amid the wreckage. Miraculously she never breaks a heel or acquires a smudge on her pure white clothing.

Massive action scenes frenetic scope and a fully realized 3-D environment are what summer movies are all about -- and Transformers Dark of the Moon offers maximum amounts of these throughout the 154-minute running time. The last hour is big bigger than anything weve seen all year highlighting director Michael Bays prodigious visual gifts. Thankfully the story and tone have been (mostly) cleaned up from previous iterations allowing an audience to focus entirely on the (admittedly simplistic) good vs. evil spectacle playing out in front of them. The film opens on the Transformer home planet of Cybertron detailing the civil war that occurred between the Decepticons and Autobots. One side was evil (the one with ""deception"" right there in the name) while the other was comprised of solid upstanding mechanical citizens who believed mightily in personal (Autobotal?) freedom. Sadly on Cybertron tyranny is winning in a complete rout over freedom so the last of the Autobots are forced into a desperate attempt to escape their doomed planet. They crash-land into the moon (the DARK of the moon) which alerts Russian and American space agencies to an alien presence. From then on the space race is simply a contest to be the first to see alien technology up close. This summer has been all about toying with historical events (X-Men First Class) but thats a discussion for another time. Back in present day on Earth the further adventures of Sam Witwicky continue only this time the lad has switched out a brunette (Megan Fox) for a blonde (Rosie Huntington Whiteley). Our hero is down on his luck and on the hunt for a job. For saving the world (twice) hes received a medal from President Obama but hes still a recent college graduate who depends on his sugar momma girlfriend for meals. Thankfully this entire sequence is handled firmly tongue-in-cheek for Witwickys life is pure summer escapism. Sams parents visit (of course they do) to chide him about his lack of career momentum and he meets his girlfriends boss (played by Patrick Dempsey) creating instant jealousy. Mercifully Transformers Dark of the Moon isnt all about Sams life and trouble is brewing for THE ENTIRE EARTH. Sorry slipped into Michael Bay tone there for a second. In the time that has passed since Transformers Revenge of the Fallen Autobots have become stalwart American allies helping out with international relations in a manner only befitting giant transforming machines. They pay a little visit to Iran fix things right up and then theyre tasked to Chernobyl to investigate some curious Energon readings. Which is right about where all hell breaks loose. Said hell is not something that should be spoiled nor would words effectively convey the mayhem achieved in the film. Transformers Dark of the Moon vaults into the third act with more explosions than a fireworks factory. The gas pedal has been pushed in a cinder block placed upon it. Yes the plot is 20 percent illogical and sure the ""lets stop for a one-liner"" phenomenon is in full effect and the ""romance"" angle is completely forced. It hardly matters an aggregate of 15 bad minutes is no biggie especially juxtaposed against the largish amounts on entertainment injected throughout. Gone is the idiocy of the rappin robots replaced by decent amounts of levity from all corners. On that front I laughed more than a few times during this film and it wasnt of the unintentional Revenge of the Fallen variety. Everything is more crisp more taut the action placed right out in front where it belongs. Bay also remains at the top of his game where the details are concerned. The mighty USS Stout (DDG 55) gets some screen time with real combat photography used (naturally). Wingsuits are also leveraged for maximum adrenaline showing Bays willingness to evolve with the tactics and techniques of actual combat. Hes also clearly become more comfortable with the Transformers supporting cast Shockwave debuts while Soundwave and Sideswipe are back in the fold. The acting is also present this time around with Shia Labeouf turning in his best work of the series. Frances McDormand also elevated the material selling lines that a lesser actor might have stumbled with. Though inadvertent Team America homages did leave a little room for cringing the sheer scale of Transformers Dark of the Moon was most impressive. The city of Chicago was transformed into a giant CGI playground and anyone who thought action movies had run out of things to do should catch this film where squirming at the level of protagonist peril became the physiological norm. The ""significance"" factor of Dark of the Moon is huge the stakes high and momentum furious. Easily the best Transformers of the series Dark of the Moon is everything thats boisterous and lively about our big studio cinema. Though its not a perfect film its a perfectly enjoyable one masterfully crafted for the big-screen experience.

I got about halfway through and then left the theater. Only film that Ive ever done that with. I guess I just wasnt really that interested plus I didnt see Revenge of the Fallen. I did however find the first one somewhat enjoyable (I was about 13 when I saw it in the theater). SWINDLERsaid on Tuesday August 09 2011 104707 AMThis movie is like a mix between a good sci fi sfx entertaining movie and the worst movie ever. The action scenes are good Optimus was great but every time a human appears in the movie is like part of the worst and cheappiest movie ever that ruined the hole movie..and the syupid jokes where still there robot just for the background few complete transformation sequenses.. Ive seen it twice but as a hole this movie is one of the worst movies Michael Bay was like a promise talented FIRST TIMER in this one. kanesaid on Wednesday August 03 2011 52918 PMnot to sound like jerk but spiderman has healing factor not as fast as wolverine but he heals faster than normal person but slower than wolverine it would be impossible for spidey to be paralyzed good review on transformers 3 ( he shouldnt retire movie critics are tough very on movies that good or terrible its there job to criticize if you didnt like his review on the film then you will definatly hate roger ebert reveiw on the film he gave it 1 star below D rating response to nirat shah comment ) tonysaid on Wednesday August 03 2011 52006 PMyeah woo for transformers 3 has made Worldwide 1003920148 has beaten dark knight wow i enjoy show very much ill need to see if i have reelzchannel Rafaelsaid on Monday July 25 2011 123150 AMProbably Richard found the characters uninteresting but peopla who watch the cartoons know tha characters and I think Optimus Prime is a cool caracther Bumblebee is nice and Sentinel was a pretty good villain Megatron was a Sissy and not as badass as the cartoons. Sam? yes he can be annoying in times The girlfriend? unnecesary and Sam parents? make me laugh again. John Malkovich was a good addition the chinese guy too but Patrick Demsey was a mediocre villain. Rafaelsaid on Monday July 25 2011 122658 AMA lot of people doesnt understand the concept of the Transformers and the cartoons stories were simple exagerated and simple in some times. Thats the way this movie are being besides the adult humor. I found the story a tribute to some of the cartoons and he action and the 3D was incredible. Still Sams characters being pretty annoying even Shia is a good actor. The girlfriend character still cheessy and unnecesary But Some girls go to the movies for that. Kevin Klawittersaid on Sunday July 17 2011 55047 PMThe best I can say about ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" is that it is considerably better than ""Revenge of the Fallen"". Andrew Yeohsaid on Wednesday July 13 2011 104951 PMYou crack addicts know nothing about Transformers. The Bay treatment is rubbish Case and point the animated version from the 80s. The transformers DIED Megatron was a badass and humans where shyte. Most importantly you could actually see what the heck was going on. Victor Hugo Castanedasaid on Wednesday July 13 2011 74448 PMRichard is right in so many things about this movie but I have to agree with the 90 percent of the peole who liked it. Yes it is a bad movie(bad acting bad dialogues)but is one hell of a ride...Its a GREAT SUMMER MOVIE Far better than the other Transformers movies or any other Michael Bays incoherent flicks.

More about Transformers 3 >> The overwhelming sci-fi action spectacle is a merciless sensorial assault that leaves you with something akin to post-traumatic stress disorder. The third entry in brainless-blockbuster auteur Michael Bays saga Moon brings to a head the war between two alien mechanical beings the Decepticons (""who dreamed of tyranny"" says the voice-over) and the Autobots (""who fought for freedom""). In the middle stand the Autobots allies the human race which is led - in spirit if not in fact - by hyperactive manchild Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his girlfriend Carly played by an exquisite if virtually somnolent Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Clocking at a monstrous 154 minutes Moon is a stunning unremitting phantasmagoria of car chases metal-crunching crashes jet fuel-fueled explosions machinegun fire car chases crashes explosions gun fire car chases . . . You get the picture. The pic opens with a montage of cleverly altered archival footage that tells a reimagined history of NASAs Apollo program. We learn that in 1962 President John F. Kennedy launched the Apollo program to study a UFO which had crashed on the dark side of the moon. The craft is piloted by the Autobot leader Optimus Primes mentor Sentinel Prime (a particularly soft-spoken velvety voiced Leonard Nimoy). Sentinel Prime has a piece of super-duper high tech which both sides in the war are desperate to acquire. So they duke it out. There are some betrayals sad farewells and deaths. But ultimately the will for freedom truth goodness and beauty triumphs. The final battle unfolds in a frenetic impossibly complex one-hour set piece of flying fireballs mangled metal and severed human limbs that is mind-boggling for its sheer audacity and length. Its a cinematic purgatory you keep praying will end. It doesnt Bays idea of a successful film is to beat the audience into submission. The director doesnt lack subtlety he doesnt know what the word means. Yet as bad as the action sequences are Bay fails spectacularly when he goes for pathos Were treated to inumerable languid sequences of bullet-riddled American flags waving in sorrowful slo-mo as the camera pans across dead soldiers. The music shifts from its default setting - swelling patritotic heights of warfare ecstasy - to rock ballads by sensitive singer-songwriters (kid you not). If we feel anything for Bays soulless characters its for the bots. His camera barely conveys a shrug when the Decepticons massacre women and children while he expertly manipulates us to tear up whenever the bots are hurt. Always secondary in a Bay film the actors do manage to do their jobs adequately. LaBeouf a graduate of the ants-in-your-pants school of acting plays Witwicky as if he had a ferocious case of attention deficit disorder. After two films his fidgeting isnt cute anymore. Hes ably assisted by franchise regulars Josh Duhamel Tyrese Gibson and John Turturro. New additions Frances McDormand Patrick Dempsey and John Malkovich add some spice to the mix. Huntington-Whiteleys role is to make teen fans drool. So she purses her lips a lot. (Were way beyond sexism here.) Megan Fox who did the thankless demeaning Hot Babe job in the first two Transformer films at least brought some personality and humor to the role. Moon seems to have little but contempt for viewers bullying us at every turn. And it has a cynical view of the world endorsing as it does war for its own sake. At one point Bay has Optimus Prime declare Well kill them all. You may not know it at first but hes referring to the audience.

But I cant think of a film quite so vividly about the Problem in Daddys Pants as ""Transformers Dark of the Moon."" From the obsession with sleek gleaming cars of various eras to the dildo-shaped weaponry that everyones chasing after to the vagina-dentata robot thats basically a big opening lined with spinning rows of blades to the way the camera all but date-rapes model-turned-""actress"" Rosie Huntington-Whiteley one feels compelled to give screenwriter Ehren Kruger and director Michael Bay a reassuring pat on the back while whispering ""Its OK it happens to everybody."" Also read Box Office Transformers 3 Set for Huge 180M+ 6-Day Opening Heck the movie even starts with hero Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) whining about the fact that hes living off the generosity of his girlfriend Carly (Huntington-Whiteley) because he cant find a job even after saving the world twice and earning a heros medal from the president. And ""whining"" isnt an overstatement -- Sam literally mewls like a petulant schoolgirl over the fact that his good buddies the Autobots are out on missions for the government while he schleps around in an old beater going on pointless job interviews. When Sam finally gets hired by aerospace industrialist Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich sporting a silver mane and an orange tan) he soon finds himself plunged back into the action. Back in the early 60s you see an Autobot escaped the war with the evil Decepticons carrying a weapon that might have turned the tide but unfortunately he crashed on the dark side of the moon. The entire Apollo program turns out to be an elaborate ruse staged solely for the purpose of doing recon on the crash. (Buzz Aldrin for unfathomable reasons pops up as himself.) And then ... look just trying to think about the plot is making my ""Transformers"" headache come back. Suffice it to say that theres double-crossing and clanky robot battles and inappropriately phallic weaponry and the destruction of Chicago and traitorous humans and the spectacle of Shia LaBeouf getting all teary when it looks like a bad robot is going to execute Bumblebee the nice robot. ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" relies on director Bays usual jumbling of images and soundtrack bombardment but while its headache-inducing thats at least a slight improvement over the migraine machine that was ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen."" Kudos to Kruger for creating a plot which moronic though it is at least makes some level of sense and strives to be a little more ambitious than ""go to the place and get the thing."" And ""Dark of the Moon"" is not without its occasional moments of pleasure most notably watching real actors like Malkovich Frances McDormand (as a no-nonsense intelligence chief) John Turturro (reprising his ridiculous role as a paranoid former agent) and Alan Tudyk (as Turturros Dutch sidekick) overact with the glee of movie stars slumming on the old Batman TV show. When theyre off-screen alas youre left with the likes of LaBeouf Huntington-Whiteley (whose white jacket remains unstained in the face of Armageddon) the perpetually stoic Josh Duhamel (who has displayed a sense of humor in other movies just none with ""Transformers"" in the title) and -- most painfully -- Tyrese Gibson whose every utterance is an affront both to acting and to human speech. That this guy has prominent roles in not one but two cash-generating franchises (see ""Fast and the Furious The"") is all you need to know about the decline of show business. Michael Bay talked a lot about how he never wanted to make a 3D movie until he visited the set of ""Avatar"" and came away converted and that kind of talk raised some hope that the demands of 3D might actually force the director into some kind of visual coherence for a change. And unlike ""Revenge of the Fallen"" where we never get to see one solid robot fist connect with one solid robot head the battles between these metallic behemoths do register with the human eye at least before the hyperkinetic editing takes its toll. But these CG creations seem strangely weightless. Even when theyre throwing around actual cars the robots dont have that sense of gravity that makes them seem like real three-dimensional creations. (If Bay devoted his soundtrack more to crunching metal and less to awful pop songs and the dreadful score composed by Steve Jablonsky that might have helped.) Perhaps the films signature shot occurs late in the film when Huntington-Whiteley stares at the camera -- blank-faced and jaw agape -- while mortars explode and SUVs flip in the air behind her. Its one of the films many unintentional laughs sure but after hours of sonic and visual cacophony most of the audience will probably have that same glazed shell-shocked look. For all the bombast alas ""Dark of the Moon"" remains a joyless and decidedly impotent exercise that all the metaphorical rocket launchers and bazookas in the world cant fix.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Jun. 28 2011 132AM EDT Last updated Thursday Apr. 25 2013 201PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Arriving in theatres in time to dominate the upcoming American Independence Day weekend the third Transformers movie is another hefty slice of mayhem from director Michael Bay.The Transformers movies based on the Hasbro toy series of the early eighties trace the adventures of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his fraternal bond with a collection of mostly giant alien machines called Autobots who are engaged in an ancient war against other machines called Decepticons. Movies Video Sparks fly for Transformers stars Anyone who finds these alien names a stumbling block (shouldnt Decepticons call themselves something more deceptive like ""Sincere-icons""?) has not embraced the to-hell-with-logic spirit of Bays cinema. These are movies that introduce the combatants and proceed directly to the money shots - flying objects crashing vehicles and collapsing buildings - with the occasional cutaway to a slender feminine silhouette or a close up of pouty lips. At times the chaos he creates within the film frame is so abstract and exaggerated - think of him as Action Jackson Pollock - it can feel exhilarating but the relentlessness is exhausting.After 2009s Transformers Revenge of the Fallen in which the visual and narrative incoherence seemed to have achieved some historical nadir Bay promised to reign in his special effects for Transformers Dark of the Moon the first movie of the series in 3-D.To his credit during the first hour and a half or so of this two-and-a-half-hour epic there are several lucid stretches. A brief prologue establishes that the 1960s space race was really about the Russians and Americans attempting to recover a crashed Autobot spaceship or ""ark"" on the moon. As we catch up to the present the evil Decepticons are back at it out to destroy the Autobots and enslave humanity.Shortly after the title appears we move to the domestic present day and get our first view of English actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who replaced Megan Fox as Sammys girlfriend (the view is actually of her derriere which in Bays shorthand stands for ""romantic interest""). The girlfriend is named Carly and shes living with and supporting Sammy who has now grown up to be an unemployed recent college grad. When he meets Carlys suave ultra-wealthy boss (Patrick Dempsey) hes in a hurry to join the workforce.Soon Sammy gets hired by an eccentric new boss (John Malkovich with gleaming teeth and a wig) and an even stranger colleague ( The Hangovers Ken Jeong) leads Sammy back to the world of warring machines where he can be a hero again. The movie also brings back Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson as Sammys military allies plus John Turturro hamming it up as the mad genius Simmons and Frances McDormand as the tough sexually ambiguous head of national security who keeps barking out ""Dont call me maam.""But dont worry about remembering the characters - the movie certainly doesnt. In the final hour of the film in which Decepticons seize the city of Chicago Sammy and Carly are mostly reduced to ducking and running. Here Bay really comes into his own. The music swells in ear-splitting crescendos giant robots toss cars in the air paratroopers fall from planes space ships speed between skyscrapers while other twisted glass buildings turn into midway slides.Occasionally a tense orange-tinged human face appears out of the clouds of blue and black rubble reminding us that after all its the fate of humanity thats supposed to be at stake here.Transformers Dark of the MoonDirected by Michael BayWritten by Ehren KrugerStarring Shia LaBeouf Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Tyrese GibsonClassification PG Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey More Related to this Story Make peace with sequels.

Starring Shia LaBeouf Rosie Huntington-Whiteley John Malkovich Director Michael Bay Running time 234 Release Opened Jun 28 2011  Editorial Review Transformers Dark of the Moon -- the Transformers-do-D.C. movie By Mark JenkinsTuesday June 28 2011 Transformation proves to be beyond the grasp of ""Transformers Dark of the Moon the latest movie in which 1980s-vintage Hasbro toys come to life and kick bot. Rather than streamline the vehicle director Michael Bay and his team have dumped more nuts bolts and carburetors on the pile. So this Autobot-vs.-Decepticon adventure runs even longer than its predecessor ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen which was plenty long enough. With the notable exception of Megan Fox nearly all the previous movies major players return. That makes for an overcrowded scenario especially since Ehren Kruger -- the only credited writer -- saw fit to add roles for several more slumming thespians including John Malkovich Frances McDormand and Patrick Dempsey. Also on board Buzz Aldrin Bill OReilly and a space-shuttles worth of U.S. presidents shown in archival footage or played by impersonators. ""Dark of the Moon is the Transformers-do-D.C. movie and one of the things the filmmakers got right this time was dividing the story into just two chapters. The first jokier section is set in Washington (played by several Midwestern cities as well as our town). The second more action-oriented part moves to Chicago. There are brief visits to many other climes -- including the moon of course -- but holding the story to two essential locations makes the movie more coherent than its predecessor. Good luck following the demolition-derby final battle though. If ""Dark of the Moon is better grounded geographically its tone is all over the map. Dispatching Shia LaBeoufs Sam Witwicky on his third Transformers caper the movie wobbles between quick-cut action and outright slapstick with occasional sorties into PG-13 smut. Like ""Revenge of the Fallen the movie offers a glimpse of panties (although this time its the heroine not a villainess who rates an up-skirt shot). It also includes a mens-room encounter in which a berserk bureaucrat (Ken Jeong) drops his pants to show something really important to a flustered Sam. Jeongs high-pitched character is essentially lifted from ""The Hangover and thats not the only overlap with other recent flicks. Like ""X-Men First Class ""Dark of the Moon rewrites the history of the Kennedy administration from a sci-fi angle It seems that both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. were hellbent on reaching the moon so they could loot advanced technology from an Autobot spaceship that had crashed on the orbs shadowy side. After the vessels scientific treasure is finally deployed -- against earthlings by those darned Decepticons -- ""Dark of the Moon becomes a war movie. Dogged GIs and noble Autobots fight block to block to destroy the device that gives the invaders their power. This is roughly the plot of ""Battle Los Angeles although that movies action was street-level while the ""Dark of the Moon"" take on urban combat involves more vertigo-tempting skyscraper collapses and mid-air clashes. As befits a cinematic saga that began as toy tie-in ""Dark of the Moon sometimes seems designed for boys who are too young to appreciate the charms of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley the British blonde who plays Sams new squeeze Carly. (If Huntington-Whiteley is better at posing than acting that might be because shes a graduate of Victorias Secret not the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.) This is after all a movie about the fundamental coolness of sports cars that turn into sentient robots. And while the CGI and (mostly unobtrusive) 3-D are up-to-date whenever Autobot philosopher-king Optimus Prime offers Sam some wisdom the advice sounds like something from a Depression-era Boy Scout handbook. One thing has changed since the 1930s Kids dont respect their elders anymore. Now out of college the increasingly cranky Sam has moved to D.C. to find a job worthy of an Ivy League grad who helped save the world -- twice. Instead hes dissed by imperious old people McDormand as the countrys intelligence chief Dempsey as Carlys lascivious new boss and Malkovich as the corporate despot who finally hires Sam -- to work in the mailroom. At least the kid seems to be getting along better with Simmons (John Turturro) the eccentric alien expert whos a veteran of the Decepticon wars. ""Dark of the Moon is capable of having a little fun with itself. In one scene mini-Autobots watch ""Star Trek on TV not noticing that Spock has the same voice as Sentinel Prime the formerly moon-stuck bot whos rescued and revived in order to play a major role in this installment. But such self-consciousness could be dangerous. It might lead to some awkward questions What does Optimus Prime see in the whiny Sam Witwicky? Why do both the Autobots and Decepticons keep departing Earth only to reappear a few scenes later? And what is the evolutionary advantage of pretending to be a car anyway?

They cheered the robot-on-robot slugfests rendered in terabyte-straining slow motion and splashing Decepticon blood (oil?). The destruction of Chicago--complete with the skulls of vaporized passers-by rattling down Michigan Avenue like so many soccer balls--received a good number of OH SHITs. But when Megatron walked right up to the Lincoln Memorial pounded Abe to pieces and plopped down on his chair? No one knew what to say.That the damage done to Honest Abe was the product of a robot civil war can be viewed as irony or at least what passes for irony in a film as unironic as this one. But its also a reminder of how ballsy Michael Bays Transformers series is--exploiting Americas iconic tragedies for maximum impact. This time around we have bodies falling through the air over a wrecked city declared ""Ground Zero""; heroes intoning ""Lets roll"" before strapping up and heading into battle; even a gorgeous re-creation of the 1986 Challenger disaster right down to that lopsided fireball blooming over the ocean.The best part of this third installment in fact takes another signature moment in American history and repurposes it According to Dark of the Moon the Apollo program was established by JFK to investigate an Autobot ship that crash-landed on the moon in the early 1960s. (Theres even a Kennedy cameo though hes spared a revisionist Dealey Plaza in which the Lincoln Continental turns into Megatron.) The prologues moon-landing sequence (in glorious 3-D) is an exceptional reminder that for all Bays blowhard douchebagginess hes a masterful maker of images.The loving 3-D shot of Rosie Huntington-Whiteleys unearthly ass that immediately follows is an exceptional reminder that hes still a blowhard douchebag and that the rest of the movie is unlikely to meet the level of its first scene. Amid the windy speeches fiery explosions exposition dumps and product placements there are a few treats to help the intelligent moviegoer--drawn to Dark of the Moon by peer pressure or kitsch factor or an insatiable desire for overstimulation--through the ordeal.Of course there are the supporting actors. There really should be some Oscars for the secondary players in Michael Bay films because no one outside of maybe Woody Allen lets his below-the-line stars run so wild. Ignore Huntington-Whiteley (who replaces Megan Fox) and Shia LaBeouf who are just there because the movie needs a hero and a fuck-doll to inspire him. Instead enjoy the Bayian riches of the A-plus backups including Julie White as Shias wisecracking mom John Turturro as a madcap ex-spy and a bronzed John Malkovich as a--I dont even remember he plays some asshole at the company where Shia gets a job and is good at it. Best of all is Frances McDormand as a brusque intelligence chief; she took the job she told GQ because her teenage son begged her to and because it allowed her to play silly scenes with her old friend Turturro with whom she hasnt appeared absurdly since 1991. (One would assume it also paid well.)Plus theres Santiago Calatravas gorgeous wing of the Milwaukee Art Museum here made into a vintage car showroom. And 3-D sparks from destroyed choppers floating into the audience. And Buzz Aldrin And best/worst of all the psychosexual nightmare of Huntington-Whitely trapped inside a Decepticon being fondled by robotic tentacles--a queasy and innovative melange of violations straight out of some kind of Cronenmanga Id sure like to read.The plot? Come on are you really going to do this to me? I didnt even bother to see Transformers The Second One although it is possible I watched a great deal of it without sound on the airplane screen of a passenger sitting a row ahead of me that one time. Something about the moon and a space-time bridge and a new Transformer Sentinel Prime who is basically Optimus Primes dad (although theyre robots so its unclear how that works). Sentinel is voiced by Leonard Nimoy appropriately sepulchral. A bunch of robots fight a bunch of other robots and you cant tell which are the good robots and which are the bad robots because they all look alike you robot racist.The people who you think might be evil turn out to be evil. Humanity triumphs. Optimus Prime gives a speech. Chicago burns. Your brain cells perish by the thousands their howls of agony lost to the cacophony inside your skull. Vast quantities of money roughly equal to the GDP of Tonga travel from Americas wallets into the coffers of Paramount. Rosie Huntington-Whiteleys ass returns to its home planet to report that Earth is ripe for the plucking.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint If ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" isnt the summers lousiest whiz-bang movie its only because theres so much competition. Its not even the best ""3D anthropomorphic automobiles and explosions"" movie of the month. The demolition derby of ""Cars 2"" seems a work of staggering genius in comparison. Like ""X-Men First Class"" this spectacle recasts a central showdown of the Cold War as a chapter in science-fiction lore. In this telling the noble Autobots and evil Decepticons with fiendish glowing eyes battled for control of their home planet. When the tide turned against the good guys they retreated to Earth while an ark containing the key to their worlds recovery crash-landed on the moon in 1961. The Space Race was actually a competition between America and Russia to salvage the downed spacecrafts technology. Oh and Chernobyl? Same story later chapter. These days the Autobots have become a freewheeling branch of the U.S. armed forces zooming off to such locations as ""Middle East Illegal Nuclear Site"" to lay the smackdown on swarthy upstarts. We pick up our story with the Autobots human ally Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) three months out of college and still unemployed to his parents chagrin. True he helped save the world twice but in todays job market its all ""What have you done for me lately?"" His big break comes from a bug-eyed grinning tycoon (that master of oddballs John Malkovich) who challenges Sam to ""impress me."" Its hard to say exactly why Malkovichs turn is funny. Same goes for Ken Jeongs cameo as a hypertense executive whos on to the big space-cars plot or John Turturros return as a secret agent turned millionaire expose author. Theyre not joke-funny so much as energetically off-kilter winking at the postmodern irony of appearing in a movie about shape-shifting humanoid robots. Michael Bay (the computer program created by producer Steven Spielberg to execute smash-bang summer blockbuster scripts) simply throws every possible emotional tone at the screen to see what sticks. If audiences laugh its a moment of comedy; if they shriek its horror. Frances McDormand barrels her way through several scenes as the rather masculine National Intelligence Director managing to create something like an entertaining character and preserving her dignity in the process. Paramount Pictures Associated Press Bumblebee is shown in a scene from ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" The other female character of note is Sams girlfriend Carly (Victorias Secret mannequin Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) who makes her entrance as a pair of spectacular legs and a world-class rump mincing up the stairs to their bedroom. In Bays worldview women are either lissome damsels to be ogled endangered and harassed or fearsome emasculating shrews. Huntington-Whiteley who has the emotional range of a voice-chip Barbie is less affecting in her scenes with LaBeouf than is his tenderhearted Autobot bodyguard Bumblebee. ""Transformers"" runs a soul-shredding 154 minutes most of it a hash of time-killing subplots involving Russian gangsters Patrick Dempsey as Carlys predatory boss and Sams tour of duty in the corporate mailroom. The last 50 minutes are spent leveling Chicago as the Bots and U.S. armed forces throw down with Sam Carly Lt. Col. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and retired Master Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson) leading the counterattack. Leonard Nimoy voices a new robot character named Sentinel Prime who plays a key role in the hostilities and allows Nimoy to recycle his ""the needs of the many"" line from ""Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan."" There is exactly one novel idea among the slapdash battle scenes as our human heroes slip and slide through a toppling skyscraper whose foundations are being devoured by a mechanical hydra. That flash of invention aside the nonstop annihilation becomes obnoxious. The constant pounding does drive up ones bloodlust to lynch-mob levels encouraging us to revel in the sight of evil Bots being ripped limb from limb. Take heed would-be evildoers. Roland Emmerich who destroyed Washington in ""Independence Day"" New York in the 1988 ""Godzilla"" and Los Angeles in ""2012"" staged his cataclysms with visual-spatial logic and jagged jolts of wit. Bays approach is to make the robots bigger the explosions explodier and crank up the soundtrack until your skull goes numb. The appropriate response is a deafening yawn.

"Transformers 3 is heavy on special effects light on plot - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Transformers 3 is heavy on special effects light on plot By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions The screenwriter for this latest rehash is listed as Ehren Kruger but Transformers 3 might as well have been written by a machine given its tin-eared comedy and noisy soullessness. Robert Zuckerman AP Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) try to keep a stealthy profile in Transformers 3. EnlargeClose Robert Zuckerman AP Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) try to keep a stealthy profile in Transformers 3. Its better than 2009s horrendous Transformers 2 but almost anything is. VIDEO Watch the trailer STORY Will Transformers revive 3-D? PHOTOS Meet the cast of Dark of the Moon The vague story is cobbled together around the increasingly mind-numbing special effects and convoluted action sequences. But by the end of the 21/2-hour slog its hard to even remember where it began. The first 45 minutes are promising enough with a whiff of political intrigue involving the space program. Here Apollo 11 was not about exploration -- it was a cover to gather intel on a UFO that had crashed into the moon. Thats not a bad premise to work from and real news footage of presidents Kennedy and Nixon as well as the Apollo 11 moonwalk are interwoven. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin is even featured in a cameo. Transformers Dark of the Moon   out of four StarsShia LaBeouf Frances McDormand John Turturro Tyrese Gibson Josh Duhamel Patrick Dempsey Director Michael Bay DistributorParamount Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense prolonged sequences of sci-fi action violence mayhem and destruction and for language some sexuality and innuendo Running time 2 hours 34 minutes Opens in select theaters tonight and nationwide Wednesday. But any sense of invention stops there. Dark of the Moon has no intention of bothering to flesh out a concept or develop remotely believable characters. The plot exists only to provide an occasional respite from the assaulting special effects. The best players are not the leads nor are they the machines like the returning Optimus Prime or the newly unearthed Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy). Theres far too little of the eccentric characters played by Alan Tudyk Frances McDormand and John Malkovich who come closest to generating laughs in this thuddingly humorless extravaganza. Its a surprisingly impressive cast for a movie that seems to hold humans in such low regard. But people are hardly the point here. Its all about the protracted climactic battle between the Autobots (good guys) and the Decepticons (bad guys) with Chicago caught in the middle. The explosive decimation drags on for about an hour. A little razzle-dazzle transmogrification goes a long way. Theres no question that the computer-animated effects are better than those in the last two films. The transformation from simple machines to complex robots is increasingly complex just as the story grows ever more simplistic. Blockbusters dont have to be brainless and soulless but apparently director Michael Bay thinks otherwise. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Bumblebee in ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" Photo credit Courtesy Paramount Pictures During the 21/2 hours that ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" is pummeling us with cutting-edge carnage its tempting to wave a flag of surrender and admit that its merely entertainment and not the end of the world.Like every escapist contraption to which Michael Bay has hammered his name this threequel is armored with so many layers of irony that any criticism bounces back at the fool who flung it. If you say its a brainless bacchanal in which wanton destruction is a substitute for story youre missing the point -- this is the biggest brainless bacchanal that money can buy.Fans know that a ""Transformers"" flick is all about the bots and the babe with Sam (Shia LaBeouf) simply riding shotgun in the shape-shifting Chevy. Here hes so marginalized that after saving the world -- twice -- the Harvard grad cant find a job. He finally lands a mail-room gig with a Washington defense contractor (John Malkovich) through the intervention of Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) the sleazy boss of Sams new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). About that girlfriend Huntington-Whiteley is a former lingerie model and as with the ousted-for-insubordination Megan Fox Bay cant help introducing the cutie with a closeup of her butt. Thats the level of subtlety here. The fetching new damsel isnt required to act -- she just runs from the flying debris.Debris is flying in every direction because bad robots and good robots are battling for a parking spot on the moon. The subplot about the government cover-up of an alien moonbase is the most clever thing in the movie particularly because it features real-life NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin (who continues to deny that the Apollo 11 moon landing was faked). But then somehow it gets connected to the Chernobyl meltdown which gets connected to an hour-long robot smackdown atop the skyscrapers of Chicago.By now it should be clear that Bay is so indifferent to human suffering that he doesnt even bother to depict it. The cities that he topples in extraordinary 3-D detail dont seem to contain any people beside Sam and Carly and valiant American warriors (including Josh Duhamel John Turturro and newcomer fed Francis McDormand).""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" is one small step for action movies one giant leap into the abyss of mindlessness. Transformers Dark of the MoonTwo stars (out of four)Rating  PG-13Run time  237Content  Intense sci-fi action and violence Weak script overblown effects doom Green Lantern The failure of ""Green Lantern"" is bound to be blamed on star Ryan Reynolds but the real culprits are an injustice league of screenwriters and studio suits.

"Transformers 3 Dark of the Moon | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; transformers-3-dark-of-the-moon ) Transformers 3 Dark of the Moon (United States 2011) June 28 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli In the wake of widespread criticism of the second live action Transformers movie Revenge of the Fallen director Michael Bay admitted dissatisfaction with the screenplay and blamed it on the writers strike. So whats the excuse this time? If anything the script for Transformers Dark of the Moon is worse than that of its predecessor. In the future maybe Bay should abandon using a screenwriter altogether and just fill up 90 minutes with disconnected images of robo-carnage. That would serve two purposes eliminate the need to watch actors embarrass themselves trying to outshine the hardware and elide excruciating dialogue exposition and ""character development"" all of which are inferior to what one finds in the average Pink Panther cartoon. Bay makes the Transformers movies for 14-year old boys. I suspect hes one at heart which gives him insight into the mindset of his target audience. I remember what it was like to be a 14-year old boy but Im not sure I would have been more enamored with this movie at that age than I am today. Maybe it would have struck a chord when I was eight. Thats when I watched Japanese monster movies which technological advances in special effects aside are not all that different from Transformers. In those movies men in rubber suits pounded on each other. In Transformers and its sequels CGI robots wreak the same kind of mayhem as Godzilla and friends. The average Japanese monster movie didnt have much of a plot either (aside from the obvious - stomp Tokyo) but it managed to get the job done with about an hours less screen time. Its pointless criticizing the action/destruction sequences in Transformers 3. Those are the ""money shots"" of this strain of cataclysm porn. People pay for extreme special effects. They want to see these Rockem-Sockem robots mash each other into the ground while Shia LaBeouf yells loudly in the hope that a big voice will compensate for his small stature (at least compared to the Transformers). In the biggest battles I had some trouble figuring out the difference between the good guys (Autobots) and the bad guys (Decepticons) largely because (a) Im not a Transformers fan (so the nuances escape me) and (b) things were moving a bit too fast. Aficionados will no doubt chortle at my ignorance. As a lapsed Trekkie (maybe not so lapsed after all) I can provide a catalogue of the Star Trek references in Transformers 3 a clip from ""Amok Time"" a mention of the Enterprise and the biggest of all - Leonard Nimoy (providing the voice of Sentinal Prime) delivering this gem ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."" Id love to know who was responsible for that Bay screenwriter Ehren Kruger or Nimoy. Having willingly conceded that the action scenes deliver what theyre supposed to deliver - with Chicago standing in for Tokyo - I turn my attention to the things that bloat what could be a lean mean 90-minute CGI highlight reel into a 157-minute soul-sucking behemoth. The first problem is too much exposition. Especially during the first half it never stops with action scenes serving as punctuation for gabfests. Maybe Transformers fans care about or can follow the idiocy being spouted but I didnt and couldnt. Im not going to discuss how bad the so-called ""science"" for this movie is because films of this sort dont care about things like that despite being mistakenly placed in the ""science fiction"" category. (Properly this is fantasy.) Then there are the scenes that attempt to develop the character of Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) and are written with the intelligence and insight of a precocious fourth grader. Why does Bay insist on eating up screen time with sequences featuring Sam playing house with his new girlfriend Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley or her waxwork facsimile) receiving relationship advice from his parents and getting jealous of Carlys handsome boss (Patrick Dempsey)? Is it because he equates ""epic"" with ""long running time"" and therefore pads things out to achieve that aim? The story which requires more than a ""willing suspension of disbelief"" to swallow (an infusion of a mind-altering substance would be a good start) begins in the 1960s when men travel to the moon to investigate a crashed Transformers space ship. 40-plus years later Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) having belatedly learned of this discovery takes a salvage team to our nearest celestial neighbor. They return with the dormant remains of Sentinel Prime (Nimoy) who is resurrected by Optimus. Sentinel is the inventor of the Transformers greatest weapon which can be used to help or destroy humanity. The Autobots champion the former but the Decepticons led by a crippled Megatron (Hugo Weaving) have other plans. Old friends like Sam Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Simmons (John Turturro) are joined by new ones like Mearing (Frances McDormand) and Brazos (John Malkovich) to provide a human face to the resistance movement against the Decepticons as the evil metal creatures use Chicago as their base for an all-out assault on the planet. The words ""been there done that"" apply. Transformers 3 is not substantially better or worse than Transformers or Transformers 2 because its more of the same. There are battles. Things blow up. Human actors give inferior performances to machines. An attractive woman is unabashedly presented as a sex object. More things blow up. A city is leveled with the destruction lovingly crafted and presented. And in the end it comes to a smashdown between Optimus Prime and Megatron but we wouldnt have it any other way. LaBeouf who appeared to hit a low in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull has sunk to greater levels of incompetence here. Its hard to call his posturing and screaming ""acting."" Maybe this is the only way he felt he could compete with the Transformers but it shreds Sams already paper-thin character. Hes whiny and annoying and I wished one of the big robots would step on him. His new girlfriend is played by British model-turned-line reader Rosie Huntington-Whiteley who accomplishes the unthinkable of making Megan ""Bay is Hitler"" Fox look like a talented thespian. Its a clichA(c) to remark that Carly has less personality than the most insignificant Transformer but its true. There are some real actors in the cast including John Turturro who has somehow managed to keep his sanity and reputation while doing three of these movies. He is joined by a slumming Frances McDormand and John Malkovich both of whom must have failing bank accounts in need of a quick cash infusion. In all fairness Tuturro McDormand and Malkovich recognize theyre appearing in crap; it shows in the ""nudge nudge wink wink"" nature of their performances. Bays flip-flopping on the issue of 3-D has led to widespread speculation about how effectively it is used in Transformers 3. After initially voicing opposition to it he changed his position after discussions with James Cameron. Transformers 3 employs a mixture of native 3-D and post-production conversion. To his credit Bay has avoided many of the common missteps including the most pervasive (murky muddy images) but there is still motion blur during intense action sequences. The most curious thing about the 3-D however is how innocuous it is. In many scenes the 3-D approach does a remarkably good job imitating 2-D. People wearing the glasses are apt to forget that Transformers 3 is in 3-D not because theyre immersed but because the 3-D is so flat and unremarkable. Thats more than a little disappointing because the closer a Transformers film can come to an amusement park ride the better. Transformers 3 is unlikely to change any minds regarding the franchise. The brilliantly cut trailer makes it look like this might be the first entry into the series to tell a compelling story but that hope is dispelled fairly early in the proceedings. It should be remembered that Bays movies with their high energy action sequences and top-of-the-line special effects always translate into good trailers and TV commercials. But whats appealing in two or three-minute bits can quickly become tiresome when it goes on and on and on... Transformers 3 is like Transformers and Transformers 2 only bigger longer and louder. Its up to each individual to determine whether that holds appeal or is another cause to bemoan what the summer blockbuster has become.

If the world needed another epic cinematic clash between Autobots and Decepticons (and thats a Megatron-sized if) it certainly gets one in ""Transformers Dark of the Moon."" A considerably better modulated more bearable experience than ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" Michael Bays latest gift to little boys and aspirin companies everywhere places ever more advanced CGI wizardry in service of an orgiastic pileup of crushed metal and cataclysmic mayhem. Climaxing with an hourlong setpiece that lays waste to most of Chicago Paramounts 3D tentpole should leave the summer B.O. competish in roughly the same condition. Having himself expressed dissatisfaction with 2009s hugely successful but widely reviled ""Revenge of the Fallen"" mass-demolition maestro Bay has made conspicuous improvements with this third entry in the live-action franchise adapted from Hasbros popular toys and cartoons. Scripted by ""Fallen"" alum Ehren Kruger ""Dark of the Moon"" boasts a more cohesive story a more varied rhythm and a fresh target-audience lust object in the form of British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley stepping in for the equally full-lipped Megan Fox. Most notably to maximize the benefits of the stereoscopic format Bay seems to have placed a slightly higher value on visual coherence holding the frame longer than usual demonstrating more continuity in the editing allowing the viewer to savor the cars 3D-enhanced transformations in tantalizing slow-motion and including enough wide shots to allow for a more generous less claustrophobic view of the action. The result may still be a big bloated spectacle but its a big bloated spectacle you can just about follow. After a prologue recapping the civil war that destroyed the Transformers home planet Cybertron the film launches into an unexpectedly stirring recap of Americas space program during the 60s (assembled from archival footage and brief re-enactments processed to look retro-grainy). In short order pic spins an intriguing counter-narrative to the 1969 moon landing positing a top-secret NASA mission to investigate the remains of Sentinel Prime once the leader of the Autobots and something of a father figure to Optimus Prime (voiced again by the gravelly Peter Cullen). Meanwhile hints of renewed activity among the evil Decepticons are just the thing to lure young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf more cranked up than ever) back into battle. Currently jobless in Washington D.C. living with hot g.f. Carly (Huntington-Whiteley) and temporarily abandoned by Bumblebee whos off on exciting Autobot missions Sam jumps into the fray and soon butts heads with national intelligence director Charlotte Mearing (Frances McDormand bringing her usual no-bull attitude to the proceedings). Mearing in turn butts heads with Optimus Prime who wants to revive Sentinel Prime from his ancient slumber. Bad idea as it turns out paving the way for what looks like a crushing defeat for the Autobots. Pic pauses for a sobering moment of pre-apocalyptic dread capped by the image of a single tear streaking down LaBeoufs dirt-smudged cheek before turning its attention to Chicago where the Decepticons no doubt having heard of the citys superior tax credits have set up their stronghold. This climactic sequence which occupies more than a third of the films 154-minute running time amounts to some kind of exhausting tour de force; it just keeps going and going punctuated by extended setpieces that occasionally stimulate the adrenaline. The most arresting of these finds Sam Carly and various familiar faces in combat fatigues (Josh Duhamel Tyrese Gibson) trapped in a collapsing skyscraper; d.p. Amir Mokris camera weaves vertiginously in and out of the teetering building as the serpentine Shockwave one of the Decepticons nastier creations goes in for the kill. Yet even as it showcases a new degree of directorial control ""Dark of the Moon"" remains a live-action cartoon more a delivery mechanism for testosterone and axle grease than a satisfying dramatic experience. Even LaBeoufs pluck and Huntington-Whiteleys carefully ogled derriere cannot lend much human interest to a scenario in which men and women are consistently dwarfed by the surrounding mayhem. Now as before the cars are staggering feats of technical engineering diminished by the storys insistence on saddling them with petulant human motives and clunky voiceover; three movies in this franchise still cant find anything more interesting for them to do except shout menacing catchphrases before ripping out each others cyber-guts. The roles of FBI agent Simmons (John Turturro) and Sams parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) are appreciably reined in here while John Malkovich and Patrick Dempsey deliver effective if one-note support as Sams new boss and romantic rival respectively. Sound mix is topnotch and Steve Jablonskys score supplies the requisite emotional surge even as its pulsing rhythms suggest a more bombastic variation on Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howards theme for the recent Batman movies. Pic makes more sophisticated and consistently noticeable use of 3D than most recent blockbusters though foreground objects are often distractingly cut off by the edge of the frame. As reported in Variety Paramount is releasing enhanced digital 3D prints in about 2000 RealD theaters hopefully nailing the ideal level of image brightness on display at the screening attended.

By now not only do we know our good-guy Autobots from our bad-guy Decepticons but we also have parameters for the best and the worst we can expect from Michael Bay Hollywoods reigning auteur of destruction and babe ogling. (In the interchangeable role of sex doll Victorias Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley assumes the spot vacated by Megan Fox.) Dark of the Moon is hardly a fleet production but here Bay makes his best most flexible use yet of all the flamboyant bigness at his command Computer-drawn characters and human actors seem to occupy the same narrative for once. This gee-whizzy boys-will-be-boys fantasy opens with the moon landing of 1969 and a secret mission for astronaut Buzz Aldrin -- a cool sequence -- and ends naturally with a do-or-die battle. Bay fills in every available crevice in between with brassy diversions. Once again Decepticons are up to no good Earth is in danger and Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf now in full mind meld with his character) is in the middle of the mayhem. Lucky for Sam hes got bots watching his back while he gets to watch his girlfriends front.

TWITTER Shia LaBeouf Josh Duhamel John Turturro Tyrese Gibson and franchise newcomer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley star in Michael Bays movie. When the 154-minute Transformers Dark of the Moon finally ends your feeling is one of exhaustion not exhilaration. Pleased with his first effort but downright apologetic about the second Transformers movie director Michael Bay has thrown every imaginable visual effect CG animation and physical stunt all in 3D into the battle for planet Earth. Bay really needed a gag shot where one alien transforms itself into the kitchen sink. Make no mistake Out of a line of Hasbro toys Bay has created a world of his own. Call it Bay World. It has its own logic which is movie logic cubed. It has its own heroes and villains only try to tell the toys -- sorry action figures -- apart. Is the machine that favors red colors a good machine or a bad one? And once you figure that out does the damn machine switch sides? That a huge worldwide audience is primed for this movie hardly needs stating. But the range of those actually enjoying the onslaught of technology at the expense of human drama might be narrower than Bay Hasbro or Paramount think. The kick of the first movie was the pleasurable shock of humans and these transformative mechanical beings interacting. The third chapter is dedicated to little more than wanton destruction. Then too Bay World has always felt misshapen. When these action figures take center stage they are so huge and the humans so tiny that they dont comfortably inhabit the same visual space. The 3D which is actually quite good for the most part only exacerbates this sensation. Bay and writer Ehren Kruger kick-start the demolition derby with a longish sequence that recasts Americas space program of the 60s and 70s as an actual race between the U.S. and the Soviets to reach the dark side of the moon where an alien spacecraft has crashed. (For the second time this summer following his appearance in X-Men First Class footage of John F. Kennedy gets mixed with newly shot footage that embroils that president in science fiction fantasy.) What astronauts Buzz Aldrin -- who later appears as himself -- and Neil Armstrong brought back from that dark side suddenly becomes vitally important to the saving of the planet now that the bad robots invasion is under way. Which brings the movie back to its perennial hero Shia LaBeoufs Sam Witwicky who has a secret medal from the president for saving the world but cant get a job in Washington D.C. What he does have is the towns hottest girlfriend in Rosie Huntington-Whiteleys Carly. Bay has her pirouette any number of times before the camera in any number of fetching outfits to drive home this point. Theres a lot of misplaced and misfired comedy about Sams job-hunting with an over-the-top John Malkovich finally hiring him and about his increasing concerns about the attention paid to Carly by her boss played by Patrick Dempsey who seems out to match Malkovich in the mugging department. Not to be outdone are John Turturro and Frances McDormand whose attitudes can be characterized as this If youre going to be in a movie with robots you might as well act circles around them. Chew the scenery before the action figures destroy it is their motto. D.C. takes quite a licking -- the poor Lincoln Memorial does not survive it must be reported and the Beltway is left in tatters. But Bay reserves near-total destruction for Chicago. The Battle for Chicago lasts for nearly a third of the movie. Or so it seems. Buildings crumble streets buckle humans incinerate machines collapse and alien airships blast away at whatever is left. What never makes any sense though is how LaBeouf and his hardy band of humans survive any of this. They emerge from sequence after sequence of utter chaos in full makeup with hardly a hair out of place. Talk about your action figures. It was during this final battle that the 3D went badly out of focus which might be a case of the poor projector getting overheated by the nonstop noise and pandemonium. As mentioned machines and people switch sides and transform loyalties with considerable frequency. Its telling that a viewer isnt going to much care. Youre not heavily invested emotionally in these robots and only the survival of LaBeouf and his hot girlfriend seems to interest the filmmakers. Machines grinding and slicing their way through the Chicago downtown cityscape and one building cut nearly in half and tilting like that tower in Pisa are the money shots for Bay. The kitchen sink if you will. The millions of man hours put into producing this techno shock and awe must be staggering. Everyone got his job done but somewhere along the way the movie got lost.

Movie Review ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" is a big wannabe blockbuster starring some nearly lifelike extraordinarily noisy mechanical creatures that destroy most of Chicago. It also features some robots. Its the clumsy humans though who are the real automatons here. Shia LaBeouf dully mopes that nobody takes him seriously. New girlfriend Rose Huntington-Whiteley vapidly models a series of elegantly tailored handkerchiefs. John Malkovich meanwhile -- well actually I dont know why John Malkovich is here and neither does he. But he survives which worries me that someone is thinking sequel. The picture opens as discover our hero Sam with a new leggy girlfriend -- were told in a quick line that the Megan Fox character dumped him -- but no job. Its a particularly humiliating state for a young man who as he tediously points out saved the world twice. But then the evil Decepticon robots mount a new winner-take-all attack on Earth. And its up to an I-told-you-so Sam -- and his friendly Autobot friends -- to rescue the planet one more time. Movie Review Transformers Dark of the Moon (PG-13) Paramount (153 min.)

But couldnt director Michael Bay have given up while he was ahead? The first film was merely dumb. The second -- which grew so confused that Fox said she couldnt understand it even after reading the script -- included two stupid trash-talking bots many people tagged as racist. (Just ""good clean fun"" Bay insisted.) Well here we are in part III -- and the story makes even less sense. The offensive robots are gone but in their place we have other cliches including a hyper-sexed Latina a nerdy Asian named Wang and a leering camera that practically crawls up Huntington-Whitelys tiny dresses. This is probably around the point that some fans will email me that they ""go to the movies not to think"" or that I ""just dont like sci-fi."" Courtesy of Paramount PicturesShockwave in ""Transformers The Dark of the Moon."" Well being able to go to the movies and not think is fine -- but thats different from going to a movie that assumes you cant think. The characters (particularly Sams loathsome parents) are terribly drawn the jokes are awful and the story lurches from climax to climax. And while I genuinely love science fiction for everything it can provide -- what-if scenarios topical social commentary normal people caught up in abnormal events -- the ""Transformers"" films increasingly have done away with all that to concentrate on the last and least important element of the genre -- the special effects. Admitted the visuals here are terrific. The design of the Transformers is inventive and the movies scale is fantastic. A few scenes -- including one of alien aircraft hovering over Chicago -- even evoke a fleeting sense of wonder. (There is also of course the Bay trademark -- a destructive and gratuitous freeway chase.) But without any ideas this movie becomes a machine itself -- gargantuan well-oiled and lifeless. And the vocal presence of Leonard Nimoy as one of the bots -- and the fanboy-blasphemous steal of a line from ""The Wrath of Khan"" -- only serves to underline how far from fun and good sci-fi this franchise has fallen.

"Transformers 3 movie review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Latest Transformers sequel a Moon to howl atTransformers Dark of the Moon -- 1.5 starsJune 28 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticShia LaBeouf and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley star in ""Transformers Dark of the Moon.""""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" a work of ineffable soullessness and persistent moral idiocy concludes with Chicago taking it in the shorts for 50-odd minutes at the hands of the Decepticons in an alien takeover scored partially to an emo-ballad mourning the ""cataclysm"" of it all. In the original Greek ""cataclysm"" means to ""wash down"" as in swill. Another side note Mondays Chicago press screening of the third ""Transformers"" picture was delayed by 20 minutes because as the AMC River East spokesman explained to the crowd the auditoriums digital projector needed time to complete its ""ingesting"" of the feature. Well What goes in must come out. One way or the other. In the third ""Transformers"" we learn via Ehren Krugers screenplay that the NASA space program was a massive cover-up allowing the crew of Apollo 11 among others to explore the alien metal ruins on the moons hidden dark side. We learn also that Shia LaBeoufs screaming intensity knows no human limits. He acts like a twisted hyper-caffeinated rageaholic even when hes not confronting the enemy robots on Wacker Drive and environs. He acts this way simply when hes nervous about his new girlfriend played by Victorias Secret undies model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley spending time with her boss (Patrick Dempsey) whose office is played by the lovely and talented Santiago Calatrava-designed Milwaukee Art Museum. The Autobot robots from space our pals beat up on the Decepticons pretty hard in the Chicago climax. Rockets and other weapons disfigure various downtown buildings including the Hotel 71; the tippy-top of the Tribune Tower; and among others Marina City which really will have serious water-tightness issues after so much computer-generated damage. The Wrigley Building gets off with just a scratch thank God. Trump Tower conspicuously a part of the plot fares suspiciously well considering the phrase ""Trump Tower"" when spoken aloud on-screen sounds ripe for imminent ruination. For Chicagoans ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" holds a built-in interest level. It wont be the same for moviegoers in New York or LA where theyre used to seeing their respective metropoli roughed up by interstellar tourists with terrible attitudes. Director Michael Bay master of the known universe when it comes to soul-crushing blockbusters with insidious worldwide appeal manages a couple of pleasing borderline-coherent bits. Notably theres a scene -- full of queasy visual allusions to the World Trade Center towers and those who didnt make it -- where the nominal humans played by LaBeouf (whose characters personal Autobot bodyguard Bumblebee should be agitating for better material by now) and company slide down the glass exterior of a toppling office building. Down down down they go like Leonardo and Kate at the end of ""Titanic."" The scene keeps going and going and if Bay had any sense of honest thrill-making itd be honestly thrilling. He doesnt. Hes merely relentless working on your nerves in a purely clinical way without the levitating touch of the dung poet you find for example in a Roland Emmerich film such as ""2012."" To be sure the Chicago section of ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" is more involving if only on a spot-the-partially destroyed-landmark level than everything preceding it. The plot has to do with the grand old man of the Autobot race Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) returning to life and adjusting to Earth. A showdown ensues between the Deceps and the Autobots and the planet Cybertrons survival hangs in the balance. Certain weaselly human/robot alliances make matters worse. The sacred head of the Lincoln statue in the Lincoln Memorial gets shot off by an especially unsympathetic Decep. Director Bay shoots the scene for maximum volume and minimum drama his pet combination. Elsewhere a supporting character shares a mens room stall with LaBeoufs Sam and minutes later is tossed out the window to his death by a Decep. Bay hasnt a clue how to set the tone for this chain of events. Its funny? Its frightening? Its both? Its neither and both?1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesWeak plot acting demolish chance for iconic Chicago scenes...July 6 2011Magnificent Transformers explosions fires on the MileJuly 17 2010My summer with Shia Rosie Tyrese and Michael BayJune 28 2011Find More Stories AboutTrump TowerDecepticonsRosie Huntington-whiteleyTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-transformers-movie-review-20110627,0,6703160.column",200,transformersdarkofthemoon39,transformersdarkofthemoon,chicagotribune

Transformers Dark of the Moon Director Michael Bay. Cast Shia LaBeouf Rosie Huntington-Whiteley Frances McDormand. Rating PG-13 for intense prolonged sequences of sci-fi action violence mayhem and destruction and for language some sexuality and innuendo. This weeks new movie releases Special effects movies A director whose bombast knows no bounds especially in the second ""Transformers"" film Bay manages to keep the volume down - by his standards - for a while in this one. But in the end he just cant help himself. As if realizing hes spent all this money on such spectacular effects Bay pulls out all the stops in the last act in an orgy of cacophony pitting shrieking grinding metal against metal in one incoherent battle after another. By the time its over youll be beaten down pummeled into submission. OK OK we will buy the Hasbro tie-in toys Just make it stop Up to that point however this ""Transformers"" is better than the second film (though thats not saying much) with some enjoyable bits here and there. If nothing else Bay knows his audience - these things are huge worldwide and a lot of people come to see things blow up. If you are one of them you will not be disappointed on that front. It just takes a little longer to get there. Part of the reason is because a fair chunk of the first act takes place on the moon where its quieter. You know the ""Alien"" tagline ""In space no one can hear you scream"" that sort of thing. Everyone can however hear the annoying voiceover narration of Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) who explains what happened in the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons and how that came to kick-start the race to the moon between the U.S. and the Soviets - and how it led to the abrupt end of lunar missions as well. It involves Sentinel Prime (voice of Leonard Nimoy) an ancient Autobot (their Albert Einstein were told) who must be revived. Or something. Back on Earth the Autobots remain our ever-vigilant friends helping to keep the human race from destroying itself in wars. But while theyre preventing disaster poor old Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) despite having twice saved the world cant catch a break. Well thats not entirely true. While he cant get a job he has landed another hot girlfriend (former co-star Megan Fox was famously jettisoned from the franchise). Carly (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in her first role) is beautiful and supportive and works for the rich too-cool-to-be-true Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) who showers her with things like a 200000 Mercedes. Sams jealous naturally but he finally gets hired by an over-the-top John Malkovich for whom that is becoming the default description. Before long the Autobots and Decepticons are at it again with Sam eager to get back into the mix. Hes hampered temporarily by an uptight intelligence director played by Frances McDormand who proves that she too can overact - with Bay its like a gift. But soon enough Sam is back to his screaming self along with franchise regulars Josh Duhamel and John Turturro. There are deceptions and twists but in the end mostly special effects. And once again those effects are stunning. But to what end? By the time hes done Bay manages to destroy the Lincoln Memorial and pretty much levels the city of Chicago. Huntington-Whiteley isnt very good but then again neither are most of those around her; the people are often as interchangeable as the machines. Speaking of which this film suffers from one of the same problems as the others When two cars-turned-robots start fighting in close combat its nearly impossible to tell whos who or whats what. Which makes it hard to care who wins; you just sit on the sidelines and wait for them to sort things out then move on to the next clash. Too long too dumb and too loud ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" is at least an improvement on its immediate predecessor. Thats not much to get excited about but if youre looking for a reason to justify seeing it - and millions will see it - I suppose its something.

(Paramount Pictures/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday June 28 2011 400 AM Title Transformers Dark of the Moon Robots battle for the fate of Earth. With Shia LaBeouf Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Director Michael Bay. (234). PG-13 language violence. At area theaters ""There are thinkers"" we learn in ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" ""and there are doers."" By any reasonable standard Michael Bay has long since proven himself the latter. So if youre looking for a shock-and-awe experience the third in historys most bombastic summer series will do the trick. Theres no arguing youll leave feeling like you were assaulted by an army of alien robots yourself. Anyone hoping to engage even a single brain cell however is out of luck. Which is too bad since popcorn blockbusters dont actually have to be mind-numbingly stupid or soul-suckingly empty. (See ""Fast Five."") But Bays found his trillion-dollar formula and hes sticking to it. Once again our hero Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) finds himself in the middle of a massive battle between the Autobots (yay) and the Decepticons (boo). Before we can get there though we have to sit through endless exposition in which we learn that Buzz Aldrin brought a secret Transformer weapon back from the moon. The Decepticons plan to use it to colonize our planet and revive theirs; Sam and his new girlfriend (model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) want to help the Autobots stop them. Or something. Ehren Krugers rambling screenplay seems more intent on punishing than enlightening us. While the first film found some humanity in the connection between Sam and the robots--especially his car Bumblebee--this one brushes emotion aside like Optimus Prime dismissing rush-hour traffic. All that matters is the long slow slog to the Chicago-set theater-rattling finale which seems to last about four hours. Thats not a compliment by the way. Theres so much potential in a Transformer which can after all transform into anything. But Bay misses every opportunity to make something interesting out of his characters; instead hes content to spend his enormous budget on grinding destruction so generic and visually convoluted its often hard to tell who were supposed to be rooting for. (The 3D glasses add nothing but an extra dimension to your ticket price.) With the ongoing exception of LaBeouf and John Turturro as a former FBI agent the actors--including Frances McDormand Patrick Dempsey Josh Duhamel and John Malkovich--seem to be competing for most robotic performance. (Peter Cullen once again voices Optimus and Leonard Nimoy voices his former mentor Sentinel Prime.) As for Huntington-Whiteley she makes an excellent case for the return of Megan Fox in the next installment. And there will be another no doubt as soon as ""Dark of the Moon"" makes the money Bay anticipates. But surely next time he can find a more realistic motivation for all the carnage if this movie is an accurate reflection of human culture its hard to believe the Autobots would risk everything to save us. Magic Moment In the middle of the big battle everything stops as a single building folds in half and Sam gets closer to doom than he ever has before.

Its then that a bracing pacy intro explaining how the entire American space programme was a cover for an alien fact-finding mission gives way to a grotesque leering up-the-skirt shot of new leading lady Rosie Huntington-Whiteleys backside. From there it follows the same template as the first two films 90 minutes of near-unwatchable plot filler bad slapstick dubious racial stereotypes and crude softcore followed by a solid hour of indistinguishable shiny objects smashing into each other while their faceless human counterparts run about shouting Go.Football-faced fratboy Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is called back into action to save the world for a third time when a crashed Autobot spaceship is discovered on the Moon causing exiled villain Megatron to come out of hiding and restart the Transformer war. The rest of the plot is all but impossible to follow but it has something to do with teleportation invasion and the enslavement of the human race.A fairly annoying but mostly forgettable presence in the first two films LeBeouf has graduated to full-on liability his shrieking barking berserker performance just one of many inexplicable elements in this shouty infuriating film. But hes Laurence Olivier next to Huntington-Whiteley whose blank pouty turn as Sams new squeeze makes one long for the good old days of Megan Fox.Dark of the Moon isnt totally unbearable. Cameos from the likes of Frances McDormand Patrick Dempsey and even Buzz Aldrin prove amusing distractions and theres a solid action sequence set in a toppling skycraper. But mostly this is fairly agonising long loud lurid and lacklustre.

Robots fighting in eyeball bleeding 3D for a hours on end makes me think in someway its perfect.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 12 2011kieranFeaturedloved this film a shame michael bay might not be there for the forth but its about fantasy its obv not real life but its fun to watch fun to believe action packed and with some of the best picture quality ive seen in my life time the matrix franchise took movies to a new level but this movie steps it up one more level my opinion and to be honest everyone i know whos gone to see it agrees with me.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 12 2011kieranFeaturedloved this film a shame michael bay might not be there for the forth but its about fantasy its obv not real life but its fun to watch fun to believe action packed and with some of the best picture quality ive seen in my life time the matrix franchise took movies to a new level but this movie steps it up one more level my opinion and to be honest everyone i know whos gone to see it agrees with me.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 12 2011andrewFeaturedOH the worm has turned--Mr Huddlestone have we ever seen a critic provoke as much response as the movie itself?----SO-- some people actually like this movie.why notIm no child and I found it a great piece of escapist cinema.Pure high adrenelin fun with one piece of pointless casting with a sillly looking pouty stick thing who has zero screen presence and no acting ability(its a shma megan Fox and Micahel Bay fell outas she was believeable--as an ordinary girl who was really really pretty-this new one? just stuck in there with no crediblility as Sams bird or as a believeable part-just a gangly fat lipped cat walk turd creature who eats one grape and smokes 80 marlboro a day and some people thinks thats fit??) back to the movieSorry Tom but yet again the cracks in your review are as bog as the san Andreas fault.they only highlight your dislike and mistrust of huge global box office apealing action beasts such as 2012 and the transformers seriesciting poor plot and wooden acting shows up that you were looking for thespian flaws that no one else was.TOMhers a heads up mate ITS A TRANFORMERS MOVIE robots?optimus prime?Megatromn?

Didnt think the second was so good but still fun. Thought the third was again fun and worth a watch for the cgi alone. Kids or adults who grew up with the original toys amp; cartoon will enjoy. However anyone looking for something more challenging to get their amateur film critic teeth into would be best off giving it a miss. Be a kid again for a couple of hours and enjoy for what it is visually spectacular and good fun but dont expect something thats going to win Oscars. For the record theres nothing gotesque or softcore about the way the leading ladys shot in this film. She has an absolutely stunning figure which wouldve been hard to hide even if shed spent the whole film clad in jeans and a baggy jumper.A Thankfully she didnt but if youre worried about taking kids because of the reviewers reference to softcore porn....dont be.A The only skin youre going to see is legs granted long and gorgeous but legs nonetheless and nothing more risquA(c) than that.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 10 2011DannyFeaturedThis is a sad case of trying too hard to impress.

I went with high hopes but came our sadly disappointed - the CGI President was totally unconvincing Shia did spend a lot of the film just screaming and RHW seemed to be acting as though shed picked up a token bit of rough Incidentally Jock did we really need to know you had a ""semi on"" for the duration of the film?

Wrong From the ""God Bless America"" beginning of the moon landing to the (rather daft) ending the plot had more holes in it than a piece of Emmenthal. Rosie HW is very pretty - but thats it. No real screen presence no chemistry between her amp; Shia - she never seemed to fit into the role (I never thought Id say it but bring back Megan Fox please) . Did someone also do a bit of extra editing? The film went from ""the city must be evacuated"" to ""the citys been evacuated"" between one shot and the next All in all not Michael bays best effort - enjoyable for young kids who like seeing things blow up and are easily distracted but you might be better off waiting until the Blu-Ray comes out.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 5 2011JemFeaturedWatched it loved it Id buy itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 5 2011JemFeaturedWatched it loved it Id buy itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 5 2011EdFeaturedJust dull.

He obviously has no integrity what so ever since he puts his names on movies like Transformers that are not just bad but offensively bad just to make some money that I will never ever watch another movie that has his name on it either as producer or director. If he is ready to abuse the confidence viewer gives him by making him watch something that belongs on the bottom cesspool then that man does not deserve to be mentioned ever again let alone that people spend their time and money on his dreck.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 1 2011PaulFeaturedYou really do lose the will to live after a short while of repetitive cgi and npise unless you are under 9yo.

The only disappointment Ive gotten from the experience of this film is the people like you that hate a film just because you dont understand it and its story. Im sure youll feel pretty empty-headed when you see that people actually love the film despite all of the negative people like you that cant appreciate how much of a history the characters in the films have and how vast the fanbase is that loves it so much. Youll be eating your own words when you hear how amazing the film is. It may not be at the point of perfection but its as good as it gets with the emotion story action and visuals shown. Ive seen all three films now and I could not be happier with the results.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 27 2011JackFeaturedRyan then Id say Houston we got a serious problem... Transformers3 looks good to those that hated the second movieuh? Then Paramount must bet they all rush watching the movie in theaters ...but I seriously doubt that that its going to happen. Its clear that this 3rd movie is a huge disappointment to those that loved the first two movies Michael Bay cracked his wonderful toy the first two movies were excellent. This one is just bad. His two big mistakes 1) Firing Megan Fox (you never ever fire your leading actress Never); 2) Filming in useless fake 3D gimmick as Paramount forced him to just to raise ticket prices; 3) Hiring a Victoria Secret topmodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley that has an ugly face cant act and makes you only cringe ruining every single scene with her in it. More people loved Transformers2 than those that loved the first movie as boxoffice gross and DVD/BluRay disc sales demonstrated. Being this movie the opposite of what it should have been... its a huge disappointment to any true fan of the first two movies. This movie lost the romance factor the good vibe factor the good mood factor. Its a mess.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 27 2011film nutFeaturedYet another snobby nosed reviewer so out of touch with the genre hes supposed to be fairly reviewing.
