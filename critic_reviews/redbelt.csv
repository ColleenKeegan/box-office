Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mike Terry a principled martial arts teacher whos married to Sondra (Alice Braga) the daughter of a Brazilian fighting clan and is too noble or humble or something to compete. A series of bad turns involving a protege a jittery lawyer (Emily Mortimer) a dodgy movie star (Tim Allen) and his dodgier factotum (Joe Mantegna) raises the stakes however and before long that big-money contest is looking tempting...Ejiofor (right) appears in nearly every scene and does a fine job with both the fighting and the slightly precious sermonising required of him but Mamet has tackled these subjects - alpha-male rivalry conjuring deception threatened principles - before and to better effect.

What Mamet wanted is what we get...a wonderful character study. Even past the last moment of the film we are left to wonder about the nature of the two characters in the last frame. The Professor who was not in the film at all and Mike Terry who was in practically every shot embrace in what initially is perceived to look like a victorious moment. Honor is upheld integrity maintained. But then I started thinking perhaps the Professor is telling Terry through his gesture that he too is involved with the shadiness of it all and that Terry needs to succumb as well. Perhaps that is why Terry breaks down and cries as the Professor embraces him. Sure its macabre but then so is Mamet at times.

Lorey Sebastian/Sony Pictures Classics hide caption toggle caption Lorey Sebastian/Sony Pictures Classics Against his better judgment principled martial-arts master Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor center) takes down a pair of policemen who get in his way. Lorey Sebastian/Sony Pictures Classics Director David MametGenre DramaRunning Time 99 minutes Watch a Clip In this quasi-inspirational martial-arts drama the scuzzes and scumbags -- usually front and center in David Mamet movies -- play supporting roles to the principled guy whod normally be their patsy. Inspiration? From Mamet? Well yes in a manner of speaking. Chiwetel Ejiofor is Mike Terry the aphorism-spouting proprietor of a martial-arts school whose mantra in a fight-to-win profession is ""fight to prevail."" Mikes a compulsive do-gooder out to help (a) a manic woman with drug issues (Emily Mortimer) (b) a police officer with control issues (Max Martini) (c) a wife with money issues (Alice Braga) and (d) a self-destructive Hollywood celeb with self-image issues (Tim Allen). As you might imagine this leads to a plot line that feels as scattered as it is overthought. With Mamet regulars Ricky Jay (as a fight promoter) and Joe Mantegna (as his crooked lawyer) haunting the storys fringes and sputtering in the writer-directors patented brand of street-speak the film is never dull. But Mamet isnt terribly comfortable with the Rocky-style big-fight finish his plot requires -- and in trying to finesse it hes left his film fighting to prevail over a finale thats at once implausible and clumsy.

In fact Redbelt seems like about as horrible an advertisement for MMA as anybody could dream up. Inspired by writer-director David Mamets own Jiu-Jitsu training the story follows Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a Jiu-Jitsu master struggling to keep his studio afloat who becomes embroiled in a complicated affair involving a cop he trains a messed-up attorney (Emily Mortimer) an aging action movie star (Tim Allen) and a kitchen sink of other characters culminating in a fixed tournament. Why would anyone involved in trying to make MMA into an accepted sport want to be within a million miles of a movie that even brushes on fixing fights? It makes about as much sense as the rest of the convoluted mish-mash of a story that comprises the bulk of Redbelt which relegates anything interesting about practice of Jiu-Jitsu to the sidelines. Even on a second viewing its a stretch to make sense out of the plot and Mamets trademark conversational yap seems more like watching actors try to recover after having forgotten their lines. ""There is no situation that you cannot turn to your advantage"" quotes Terry at one point in the movie . . . no situation except this one which just seems like a missed opportunity.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. May 9 2008 Redbelt (out of 4)Starring Chiwetel Ejiofor Tim Allen Emily Mortimer Alice Braga Ricky Jay David Paymer and Joe Mantegna. Written and directed by David Mamet. 99 minutes. At major theatres. 14A In David Mamets hard world good people are the flints upon which vile cynics strike their matches.We know going into one of his movies that an innocent is about to have his hopes dashed and that trust is something the gullible confer upon the greedy. We are also likely to be stained by oily characters played by Ricky Jay David Paymer and Joe Mantegna the three horsemen of Mamets ethical Apocalypse.All of the above situations and sinners are present in Redbelt Mamets new film that takes its name from a martial arts honour. Its also a nod to the writer/directors passionate hobby of jiu-jitsu which he took up after moving to Los Angeles from Chicago earlier this decade.But heres something new which I cant recall from previous Mamet maulings ""Theres always an escape."" The phrase qualifies as hope in the Mamet lexicon and it helps sustain a movie that often threatens to hit the mat from its many plot twists.Its also the most insistent of the many Eastern bromides mouthed by jiu-jitsu instructor Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor an actor ascendant) who puts principle ahead of profit. He refuses to teach people who wish to engage in battle for anything but the purest of reasons. Hes not showy about his philosophy but he is insistent. Terry tells people to ""prevail"" rather than ""win"" which is antithetical to the big-money TV brawling that everyone else seems to be into but which he abhors. (In this case its the martial arts hybrid called Ultimate Fighting.)Terrys uncompromising stance means hes barely making the rent on his West Los Angeles studio but hes happy nonetheless. He has a few loyal students and a wife named Sonia (Alice Braga) who looks sexy even when shes fretting about paying bills.Then something happens that shatters Terrys Zen-like calm along with the plate-glass window of his studio. An upset lawyer named Laura (Emily Mortimer) staggers into the studio and fires a police officers gun that just happens to have been left lying around.Grand and somewhat contrived complications flow from this incident but even more astounding encounters are to come. They include a barroom brawl in which Terry plays hero to a drunken Hollywood star presented by an almost unrecognizable Tim Allen who rewards Terry with gratitude that arrives like a Trojan horse as it must in a Mamet movie.There is reason to fault the filmmaker but just a bit. Unusual for him he cant seem to make up his mind as to what kind of movie hes making. Is it another of his devilish deceptions replete with magic tricks (the sleight-of-hand involves marbles this time)? Is it a sinewy struggle of good vs. evil? Or is it - and this is also new for Mamet - just a pretty good fight picture in which sweaty men slam each other to the beat of ceremonial drums?Its all of the above actually and the glue that holds it together is Ejiofors muscular performance as a man whose principles may be about to feel the brass knuckles of reality.What about the escape though? Is there really one? That would be telling and with David Mamet you never can tell.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Chewitel Ejiofor Emily Mortimer Alice Braga Tim Allen Rebecca Pidgeon and Joe Mantegna. Directed by David Mamet. (R. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In his engrossing new film ""Redbelt"" David Mamet uses jujitsu as a metaphor for life. If it doesnt fit quite as neatly as baseball thats only because relatively few are familiar with this form of mixed martial arts which developed from judo. So heres a crash course written by somebody who besides being a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright also trained in jujitsu for five years. ""Redbelt"" is entertaining in a pulpy kind of way like the fight films of the 1930s and 40s and more accessible than most of Mamets movies. His dialogue for ""Redbelt"" with its sentence fragments and repetitions (""thats right thats right"") is as idiosyncratic as anything he has written for the stage. It sounds appropriate spewing from hustlers on the fringe of professional jujitsu. For a fight promoter offering a bribe Mamet coined the word ""financialize"" which has the ring of something youd hear on Bloomberg. Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor in a career-making performance) the owner of a jujitsu academy in a seedy part of Los Angeles has disdain for those who profit from the martial art by competing. Hes a purist who instills in his students the samurai code of honor. Terry is barely able to keep his school open as his wife Sondra (Alice Braga Sonias niece) who manages the books knows better than he does. A gun accidentally goes off breaking the window of the place and causing all manner of collateral damage. Most amusingly it injects Mike into the world of Hollywood. At a nightclub he saves Chet Frank (Tim Allen) a spoiled movie star from bullies. The next day Mike receives an invitation to Chets house for dinner and a 20000 gold watch. The party at Franks mansion clearly has been informed by Mamets experiences in the movie industry. Not only does Chet want to be Mikes best friend - he invites him to be his producer - but Chets wife (Rebecca Pidgeon who happens to be Mrs. Mamet) wants to be Sondras. Movie deals and fashion deals are dangled in front of the young couples eyes. Their naivete is sweet but also dangerous. The cast has been meticulously chosen. Ejiofor (""Talk to Me"" and ""Children of Men"") isnt large but he projects strength and a reassuring presence and his decision to speak softly reinforces the notion of a man keeping enormous power under wraps. Allens Chet is the opposite someone who makes a habit of throwing his weight around. Allen uses his natural affability to show how quickly you can either be part of the in-crowd or be on the street. Hes mastered Mamets difficult delivery. The parts for women arent as hearty though the actresses do what they can with them especially Emily Mortimer as a lawyer with emotional problems who fires the gun. Only after seeing the rest of the film do you understand how everything relates to that errant gunshot. If Mamet the director had a third the brilliance of Mamet the screenwriter this would have been a great movie. You get the feeling he became a filmmaker only so other directors wouldnt muck around with his words. In scenes set inside Mikes school Mamet seems to forget he has a space larger than a stage to create on. Los Angeles looks as desolate as an Edward Hopper painting. Things do pick up visually at a jujitsu meet at which athletic bodies compete through minuscule movements. Mamets love for the sport comes through in every frame. -- Advisory Profanity.

"Redbelt | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; redbelt ) Redbelt (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Most directors upon entering a genre with which they lack familiarity adhere strictly to ""the book."" David Mamet however throws ""the book"" out the window. The resulting movie a mixed martial arts concoction called Redbelt is different than what fans of Mamet MMA or anything else are likely to have seen before. The plot is borderline ridiculous and certainly doesnt stand up to close (or even not-so-close) scrutiny but theres a level of entertainment to be had watching it unfold in all its strangeness. And as always with Mamet theres the question of whether his particular method of directing actors to speak his dialogue (a mannered staccato delivery) is effective or distracting or perhaps both. Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is the owner of a small self-defense studio that teaches karate jujitsu and a variety of other techniques. His ""prize pupil"" is police officer Joe (Max Martini) whom he instructs not only in the arts of physical domination but in the need to maintain respect and honor in all areas of his life. Despite badly needing money Mike will not enter MMA competitions because he believes they demean the life lessons he is trying to impart. His lovely wife Sondra (Alice Braga) is losing patience with his code of conduct as she funnels money from her successful business into his unsuccessful one. One evening a distraught woman (Emily Mortimer) stumbles into the studio searching for help. When Joe tries to assist her she mistakes his actions for an attack grabs his gun and fires it. The only casualty is the stores front plate glass window but the replacement cost is another nail in Mikes financial coffin. His luck takes a positive turn however when he visits a bar owned by his brother-in-law and defends action star Chet Frank (Tim Allen) in a bar fight. Chet is grateful and wants to get to know Mike but his motives may not be as simple as pure gratitude. Because nothing is as straightforward as it initially seems one has to pay attention to Redbelt to avoid becoming lost. Even for those attention does not wander the density of the plot can be daunting and the situation is made problematical by a lack of coherence and consistency. The more one understands the scam underlying Mikes circumstances the more it becomes apparent that it simply doesnt work. Even if a viewer was to accept that holes are being plugged by off-screen factors the plan demands too many coincidences to be credible. Thus the delicious quality of the double-crosses loses its zest. Human interaction is also not Redbelts strong suit. Several scenes with potentially potent emotional content (a suicide a betrayal) feel flat because the characters barely react. In fact in one scene a widow confronts Mike about her husbands death and there are no tears or grief - just anger that she wont be able to pay the bills. Considering what we know about the marriage this response rings false. Theres a sense that Mamet spent so much time and effort crafting the dialogue that he lost sight of the bigger picture. The movie is being marketed as a sports film with several big name stars. While the cast is populated by a number of recognizable names the ones with the most screen time are Chiwetel Ejiofor Alice Braga and Emily Mortimer. Tim Allen has a relatively small role as a big-time Hollywood star who doesnt do as well in real-life fights as in movie struggles. (The fact that he walks into a bar without his usual entourage is a clue that somethings not on the level.) Allen is generally a cinematic lightweight but this is some of the best work he has on the big screen. Mamet regulars like Ricky Jay Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamets wife) and Joe Mantegna make their obligatory appearances. Redbelt moves inexorably toward the climactic event of any sports movie the ultimate bout. Mamet does something smart here changing things up but in a way that wont disappoint those who want their pound of flesh. Once again its necessary to throw reality out the window because it doesnt apply but taken at face value theres a degree of satisfaction in the way Redbelt concludes. Anyone attending with the expectations that this is going to satisfy a primal desire for wall-to-wall combat will be sadly disappointed. This is a movie of contradictions. Its neither uninteresting nor unentertaining but the plot is as threadbare as an old carpet and Mamets narrative contortions will leave many viewers scratching their heads.

Theater Lagoon. (View showtimes here) ""The Duchess of Langeais"" is a stately costume drama of wrenching passions expressed in courtly phrases. It opens with an irresistible hook A brooding French general (Guillaume Depardieu son of Gerard) obtains an audience with a nun called Sister Theresa (Jeanne Balibar). Their tense interview conducted under the watchful eye of the Mother Superior ends when an agonized Sister Theresa shrieks ""Mother I have lied to you This man is my lover"" Then the film retreats five years to replay the soldiers emotional siege of the beauty -- who was then the titular Duchess an alluring queen bee of Paris society -- and her wily coquettish resistance. Their elaborate strategies and mind games become a battle of wills as violent as any conflict in a Napoleonic theater of war. COLIN COVERT REDBELT  1/2 out of four stars Rating R for strong language. Theater Lagoon. (View showtimes here) It sounds like a movie that was created by flipping randomly through a copy of the Hollywood Reporter a mixed-martial arts drama written and directed by ""Mr. Gravitas"" David Mamet starring art film heartthrob Chiwetel Ejiofor and comedy king Tim Allen. Ejiofor plays a Los Angeles jiu-jitsu instructor and gym owner whose lessons have as much to do with honor as takedowns and escapes. When he rescues Allen an over-the-hill action star during a bar fight he is drawn into Hollywoods world of opportunism and exploitation. Hes forced against his will to enter a broadcast competition with his marriage his livelihood and his reputation in peril. The film generates crackling tension as Ejiofor slowly realizes that his life is crumbling while sharks played by Ricky Jay David Paymer and Joe Mantegna circle him teeth bared. But Mamet tries to load the story with more drama than it can bear. He loves twists and misdirection and overstuffs the plot with too many con games. Ejiofor fights his way back to honor in the final minutes usually a stand-up-and-cheer cinch of an ending. Unfortunately the blocking of the action is unremarkable and the climax resolves the films remaining dilemmas all too neatly. ""Redbelt"" ranks as one of Mamets lesser efforts as writer and director. COLIN COVERT BLINDSIGHT  1/2 out of four stars Rating PG for thematic elements and mild language. Theater Oak Street. (View showtimes here) In Tibetan culture blindness is seen as a punishment for misdeeds in a previous life. Lucy Walkers film ""Blindsight"" follows six teenage students at a school for the blind who attempt to scale a 23000-foot peak on the northern side of Mount Everest in a bid for self-esteem and respect from others. Under the direction of blind mountaineer Erik Weihenmayer and an international team of guides the children train develop deeper bonds with one another and share their life stories. One was sold at age 10 to a couple that made him a street beggar. If he didnt earn enough money they beat him. His nickname Lucky. And yet he turned out to be a tough lovable survivor. Much more than an ""inspirational gimp"" story ""Blindsight"" finds drama in the disagreements between the climbing guides over whats best for the children. Westerners clash with Tibetans Americans with Europeans and kids with adults as tears flow (and freeze) and high-altitude health problems arise. The structure is a bit wobbly with an emotional family reunion in China inserted uneasily into the Tibetan climbing scenes yet the physical hurdles they overcome are so symbolically important its impossible not to be moved. When they reach a plateau where melting ice has created a tactile sculpture garden their delight is infectious. We get a notion of their joy in the shapes thats as sensational as the scenery all around them. Watching it you feel almost as much a winner as the kids themselves. Stick around through the closing credits for a rousing solo performance of ""Happy Together"" by a young blind student. Who knew the Turtles were so big in Tibet?

In Redbelt a David Mamet-job full of tough patter repetitive queries and poker-face actors walking in and out of rooms Mike tries to practice what he preaches turning a series of unlucky events to his favor. Redbelt is a tale of art vs. commerce - Mike who runs a martial-arts gym in Los Angeles represents the art and Mamet regular Ricky Jay playing a promoter of Ultimate Fighting-like matches stands for the crass pursuit of a buck. Written and directed by the prolific Mamet the film begins with promise but tumbles into exasperatingly convoluted scenarios. But Ejiofor the British actor of Dirty Pretty Things and Children of Men is terrific in the lead - his quietness and watchfulness is perfect for a guy who is all about the Inner Warrior about purity of mind and the certainty and resiliency of the body. But Mamet whose writing here isnt as crackling nor as colorful as it has been in films such as The Spanish Prisoner or The Winslow Boy surrounds Ejiofors insistently honorable Mike with two-dimensional charlatans and shills a shifty loan shark (David Paymer) a smug movie star (Tim Allen) and his slick sidekick (Joe Mantegna). The women in Redbelt are equally unconvincing. Emily Mortimer in the role of a nervous-nelly lawyer sets the plot in motion when she sideswipes a parked car in front of Mikes gym. But theres a blankness about her character that matches the look in her eyes. Alice Braga as Mikes wife is reduced to nagging and needling - trying to deal with bounced checks and her husbands unwillingness to ""sell out."" That would involve accepting a spot on a martial-arts matchs undercard - 50000 for entering the ring and punching flipping and kickboxing an opponent around in front of hordes of fans. Despite the deep and dangerous hole Mike and his wife have dug for themselves he doesnt want to do this. But well there are some situations that maybe you cant turn to your advantage after all. And then you can. One of the problems with the way Mamet resolves Mikes predicament is that its ridiculously implausible - even in the context of a far-fetched fight story. The climactic sequences too are poorly staged. Mamet is a master of talk not action and despite the presence of cinematographer Robert Elswit who just won an Academy Award for There Will Be Blood and despite a percussive score from Stephen Endelman and the presence of a top-tier stunt coordinator Redbelts ultimate Ultimate Fight moment feels sorely lacking. Redbelt 1/2 (out of four stars) Written and directed by David Mamet. With Chiwetel Ejiofor Alice Braga Emily Mortimer Tim Allen Joe Mantegna and Ricky Jay. Distributed by Sony Pictures Classics.

That in-your-face mentality becomes more literal in Redbelt a movie set in the world of martial arts specifically Brazilian jujitsu. Of course the setting is as in many of Mamets films merely a device to set up twists and turns in the story. And before it sort of punches itself out in the final few minutes its a surprisingly compelling story about honor and betrayal. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mike Terry a jujitsu instructor whose motto - ""Theres always a way out"" - will be tested severely. Despite his legendary expertise Terry refuses to fight in competition believing it weakens a fighter. He prefers to train fighters in his no-frills academy even though he could use the serious money there is to be made in mixed-martial-arts fighting. One night after a session with police Officer Joe Ryan (Max Martini) a twitchy lawyer (Emily Mortimer) shows up an accident occurs and a chain of events is set in motion that will indeed lead Terry into the ring - although the manner in which he arrives there isnt what we expect. Along the way Terry crosses paths with action star Chet Frank (Tim Allen - yes that Tim Allen) who enlists Terrys help on the movie hes making. He has Terry over for dinner introduces him to his manager (Joe Mantegna) talks about making him a producer. Even Terrys wife Sondra (Alice Braga) discusses going into business with Franks wife (Rebecca Pidgeon). Suffice it to say that nothing goes according to plan. At times Terrys honor is almost a hindrance denying him opportunities he might have taken advantage of. Yet he remains unswayed often to the consternation of friends and family. He takes the lessons he teaches to heart. Many of the usual Mamet suspects are here including Ricky Jay as a promoter whose sense of honor does not extend quite so far as Terrys. Of special note is Allen. His role is relatively small but its about as far from The Santa Clause or the man-dog in The Shaggy Dog as its possible to get. His action-star hero is a jaded cynical movie star weary of his celebrity. Mamet doesnt quite do for Allen what Quentin Tarantino did for John Travolta in Pulp Fiction but its definitely a different kind of role for the voice of Buzz Lightyear. Ejiofor is outstanding giving a measured performance as a man determined to maintain balance even as his world closes in on him. Mamets films are filled with confidence men hucksters swindlers. Terry is the opposite. Hes noble enough to begin with. In this world hes practically a saint. The film loses steam toward the end even as the fighting heats up. The final bout is rather oddly filmed (in part by necessity though to say why would spoil the surprise) and the story by then has played out. But even with its problems Redbelt winds up as a tale of street-smart optimism a rather straightforward tale of good vs. bad beneath all the plot twists. Given the context aint that a kick in the head? Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Redbelt is like every boxing picture you ever saw a gifted morally principled rather innocent fighter discovers that the real world is full of crooks and shysters. The fighter reluctantly confronts those who would sully his name and game wins some sort of conditional victory over them. And gets the girl besides. There is however one difference between writer-director David Mamets film and other fight game tales; it is not about boxing. It is about a mixed martial arts combat that involves elements of jiu-jitsu kick-boxing and the many other weird ways men have devised to do great bodily harm to one another. That gives Redbelt an original edge that somewhat separates it from the boxing genre. This advantage is greatly enhanced by its protagonist Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor who is excellent in the role). Mike is a black belt jiu-jitsu instructor running a none-too-successful school in South Central Los Angeles yet refusing to fight for the money that would lift him out of poverty. He holds to the ancient Samurai Code which insists that competition is crass a dishonor to the purity of the ""art"" that he practices. Jiu-jitsu he insists is not about winning and losing it is about finding ""escapes"" from desperate situations escapes that allow both participants to withdraw from combat with their honor intact. You might say that it is like a muscular and physically graceful form of chess in which the best possible result would be a draw. As I probably dont need to tell you Mike has his problems trying to maintain his austere values in contemporary Los Angeles. All kinds of troubled people -- a frenzied lawyer a louche movie star a corrupt producer and a rich variety of thugs and toughs swim through his life. On top of which his wife -- who seemed pretty OK for awhile -- betrays him because she has money troubles of her own. Eventually reluctantly he decides to fight for money except that he discovers that the card on which hes booked is rigged. So he... But wait a minute. Redbelt contains even more plot than that too much of it I think for a film of quite modest length to carry comfortably. It feels to me a little rushed and breathless despite the fact that it is generally well-played and is beautifully photographed in a low-key burnished light by Robert Elswit who just won an Oscar for There Will be Blood. This cram-it-all-in manner is particularly surprising given that the film is obviously a labor of love for Mamet who tells us in a directors statement that he has spent something like five years learning jiu-jitsu and is passionately committed to the values it represents and promotes. I also missed the hard wit of the language we associate with Mamet -- funny cynical laced with well-chosen obscenities. Its almost as if his tongue was slowed by the seriousness with which he regards his subject. I dont like to trap any writer -- especially one as good as Mamet -- in my expectations. He surely has a right to reach for a new manner whenever the spirit moves him. But the LA demi-monde hes exploring (often with his shrewd observational skills fully intact) seems to cry out for the intensity of expression that made plays like Glengarry Glen Ross and movies like The Verdict sing with a sort of atonal harshness helping them transcend the rather confined situations he prefers. Redbelt (the title refers to the highest honor available to jiu-jitsu fighters) despite its novel milieu somehow remains trapped in genre conventions. Its still basically a boxing picture not essentially different from dozens of other movies about life in and around what the old time sportswriters used to call ""the squared circle."" Mamets circle is alas just a little too square.

Its good advice but theres no worry about wasting precious hours of your own life on this movie. The gadgetry is absolutely dazzling the action is mostly exhilarating the comedy is scintillating and the whole enormous enterprise spawned by Marvel comics throbs with dramatic energy because the man inside the shiny red robotic rig is a daring choice for an action hero and an inspired one. Robert Downey Jr. works marvels on his own. Its not that he has reinvented himself for the role although he looks impressively fit but that in such extravagant surroundings he remains true to his quick flip wit his laconic style and best of all to his jaunty humanity. Thanks to him and to his director Jon Favreau some of the movies most enjoyable scenes include Tony talking and thinking -- intelligence as action -- as well as soaring through the skies in his cyborg suit and righting the worlds wrongs as a knight in space-age armor. It helps that Tony Stark is an arms manufacturer with a genius I.Q. a sort of Howard Hughes unencumbered by looniness. This guy is so brilliant and Mr. Downeys performance is so smart that youre willing to believe he can do what he does when terrorists capture him in Afghanistan -- escapes their slimy clutches by building a crude prototype of the Iron Man suit from components of Stark weapons that have fallen into the terrorists hands. ENLARGE At times the movie operates in traditional James Bond territory. Tony owns exotic cars a Malibu pad that looks like a Brasilia version of San Simeon and a private jet big enough to accommodate pole dancers. But that territory no longer defines James who took a turn toward seriousness in the most recent Bond adventure and it doesnt confine Tony. In Iron Man mode hes a classically exuberant comic-book hero from his flame-throwing missile-launching fingertips to his plasma-spewing toes. The genius of the production lies in the agility with which it leaps from one mode to another. Ill be happy to see it again -- and plan to do so over the weekend -- for the pleasure of Mr. Downeys company plus the genuine sophistication of the world that Tony Stark inhabits when he isnt driving his sexy cars or bedding a sexy writer from a glossy magazine. The serious-ish plot involves Tonys spiritual conversion from an arms magnate to a peacenik at war with his own corporation and the military-industrial complex not to mention global terrorism while his comic-book origins give him what amounts to an Achilles heart a nuclear-powered device that makes him vulnerable as a man and all but invincible as his alter ego. ENLARGE Robert Downey Jr. takes flight in ""Iron Man."" Both egos go quietly gaga for his loyal assistant Pepper Potts -- shes played with elegance and warmth by Gwyneth Paltrow. Despite her Bond-girl moniker Pepper is a woman of substance equal to her style and she stands by both sides of her man. During a party at Disney Hall they murmur sweet nothings on the dance floor. During a near-death experience involving his ticker he tells her with heart-stopping tenderness ""I dont have anyone but you."" And its perfectly true unless you count Jarvis Tonys artificial-intelligence system -- a better-educated and vastly more verbal descendant of HAL -- and the endlessly abled robots who help create Iron Man in Tonys lab. (Jarvis was a flesh-and-blood butler in the Marvel Comics adapted here by screenwriters Mark Fergus Hawk Ostby Art Marcum and Matt Holloway.) Jeff Bridges plays Iron Monger the heros nemesis; hes the alter ego of Obadiah Stane the bald-pate patriarch who has been running Stark Industries for Tony since the younger mans father died. Mr. Bridges makes malevolence interesting -- no surprise there since hes a splendid actor -- but the climactic battle between the two metallic gladiators is not what it might have been; theres a repetitive quality to the epic clanking a flickering silliness in the spectacle of two grown men in gigantic robot suits. If truth be told other elements of the story seem slightly vague in retrospect the role of Rhodey Rhodes an Air Force colonel played with easy charm by Terrence Howard; a coda that feels -- and in its suddenly flat lighting looks -- like an afterthought. Yet the greater truth is that none of the defects matter very much in the context of this hugely entertaining movie and nothing can detract from Robert Downeys triple triumph -- half man half robot all star. Redbelt A different kind of knight -- without armor but unswervingly guided by honor -- stands at the center of David Mamets ""Redbelt"" an intriguing action parable set in the exotic milieu of jiu jitsu. (The brilliant brooding cinematography is by Robert Elswit.) Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Mike Terry a jiu jitsu teacher and the owner of a bare-bones academy in Los Angeles that serves him more as a refuge than a source of income. Mike is that martial-arts archetype a pacifist warrior who wants no part of the fight game. He prefers teaching others to fight -- to prevail as he exhorts his students -- while living his own life according to the samurai code. Mr. Ejiofor gives a commanding performance perfectly calibrated in whats withheld just as much as whats revealed. Mike is obviously a vivid spirit hiding his light. The questions are why and how long he can meet the needs of those who depend on him -- his Brazilian wife is played by Alice Braga -- while holding out against the pressures of a venal world. Mr. Mamet constructs an intricate set of circumstances that squeeze Mike on all sides. As in most Mamet films the tone ranges from gritty realism to stylized speech patterns and the cast of characters is diverse Tim Allen as a sleazy Hollywood star; Emily Mortimer as an attorney in distress Max Martini as an earnest cop Ricky Jay as an unprincipled promoter. Yet the artifice gives way to a clarity of purpose in Mikes forced march toward the ring. In the end he prevails on his own terms. The same goes for Mr. Mamet and his tough-minded movie. ENLARGE Morgensterns DVD TIP Its wonderful to see Robert Downey Jr. working at the top of his game but hes been doing that for several years. When Shane Blacks delightful ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" opened in 2005 I wrote that Mr. Downeys starring role as Harry Lockhart a petty crook taken first for an actor and then for a private eye reveals him ""returned fully to form. This means that he is once again after his enforced absence just about the quickest sharpest slyest wryest and wittiest comic actor on the screen.""

ABOUT THE MOVIE Redbelt   (out of four)Stars Chiwetel Ejiofor Alice Braga Emily Mortimer Joe Mantegna Rebecca Pidgeon Tim AllenDirector David MametDistributor Sony Pictures ClassicsRating R for strong languageRunning time 1 hour 39 minutesOpens Friday in New York and Los Angeles  SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and filmmaker David Mamet has returned to the enigmatic style of The Spanish Prisoner and The Winslow Boy in his latest film Redbelt despite its unlikely setting in the world of martial arts. Anchored by a powerful and nuanced performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor Mamets latest writing and directing effort is a compelling drama about the world of martial arts fighting. Though the dialogue is perhaps not as potent as in his finest work its still much crisper and sharper than most movies set around fighting. Ejiofor plays Mike a Jiu-jitsu instructor who has stayed away from prizefighting because he believes ""competition is weakening."" His much more practical wife played by Brazilian actress Alice Braga scoffs at his choice to operate a self-defense school with a samurais code of integrity ""Youre too pure to compete too pure to make money"" she accuses him. But an accident involving a distraught lawyer (Emily Mortimer) and a compassionate police officer (Max Martini) leads to events that threaten to derail his life. Mike is forced to enter the ring to pay off debts and re-establish his honor. He must deal with a crooked promoter (Ricky Jay) and a sleazy agent (Joe Mantegna) following a seemingly chance encounter with a self-absorbed movie star (Tim Allen in an intriguingly dark role). This is a departure for the very talented Ejiofor. His muscled physique soulful eyes and expressive face are perfect for the role. He can speak volumes saying very little. The rest of the ensemble also is well-cast. The film is at its best when dealing with human interactions and motivations and drags once it gets into the arena. But its vivid cinematography by Robert Elswit (There Will Be Blood) is a highlight. Mamet who has a purple belt in Jiu-jitsu clearly is fascinated by the philosophy underlying it which explains such Eastern-influenced exchanges as ""You train people to fight?"" ""No"" Ejiofor responds. ""I train people to prevail."" He explains to Mortimer ""Everything has a force. Embrace it or deflect it. Why oppose it?"" Its certainly not Mamets signature rapid-fire dialogue but its an intriguing and engrossing departure.

Directed by David Mamet. With Chiwetel Ejiofor Tim Allen. Now playing in New York TWO STARS There are a few things you should know about David Mamet. This is one of the things. The thing is that there is a way his characters talk. There is a way his characters talk that is not always in the accepted idiom. It is in the idiom of Harold Pinter as maybe rewritten by Damon Runyons freakin bartender. The second more obviously is a kind of macho bravado. Its entertainingly present in his most famous plays -- most spectacularly ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" -- but it reaches a kind of absurd extreme in his scripts in which you trust your fists and your guns before your woman and only dupes dare to hope. More than 25 years after his first screenplay for the remake of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" his world view hasnt changed a hair. ""Redbelt"" his latest film-making job sticks to the same traditions of blank-verse profanity flagrant heterosexuals and middle-aged man-crushes. The villains are living-large gamblers club-owners movie stars. The hero is an almost preternaturally calm jiu-jitsu master. The climax unfolds against the sweaty crowds at a the-fix-is-in fight. That the film briefly quotes a line from ""Body and Soul"" is not accidental. (Or credited for that matter.) Its a fairly standard prize-ring thriller -- just with martial arts substituting for boxing -- but die-hard Mamet fans will find things to like. There is the trademarked repetitive rhythmic dialogue (""You want to make some money? Give me a call. Youll make some money"") and con job flourishes. There are the stock-company faces (wife Rebecca Pidgeon old friends Ricky Jay and Joe Mantegna) and some new ones (Tim Allen as a cocky action star). Theres also Chiwetel Ejiofor as our hero Mike Terry a martial-arts instructor who refuses to compete for money because it would dishonor the sport. Meant to be a sign of Terrys rigid sense of honor it only makes him look like a selfish snob -- particularly since he finds no dishonor in taking money out of his wifes business to keep his own going. Yet Ejiofor an actor with a rooted mature presence almost makes this knight-in-white-pajamas work. Almost but not quite. Because the third thing you need to know about David Mamet is that his own cleverness delights him. This is a dangerous trait as he ends up both underestimating the movie genres he dabbles in and overestimating the delights of his own far-fetched plots. Like the con men he idolizes his movies (""Spartan"" ""Heist"" ""The Spanish Prisoner"") are blurs of misdirection and confusing sleight-of-hand. Now you get them. Now you dont. Except in the end the audience doesnt feel fooled as much as taken advantage of. Plot devices -- a stray bullet a Rolex watch a bar fight -- enter the narrative like one of Jays forced cards pushed into our faces only so well recognize them when they reappear later. But Mamets fingers arent as nimble as his friends. Instead of feeling delight in the game we only end up feeling headachy and abused. Mamet may love card games and con men and gladiatorial combat. But his own tricks here are strictly mail-order gags. And the only person bruised by the end of the competition is the audience. Rating note The film contains strong language of course and violence.

We. Are. Speak. Ing. Of Mamet. Do you hear this thing that I am telling you? What the f - - k did I just say? In a film written and directed by Mamet Mike Terry (a highly effective Chiwetel Ejiofor with an aura of suppressed force) runs a jujitsu studio in LA. ""Administer the fight"" he calls while training a cop. ""Insist"" After coming to the aid of a movie star (a potato-y Tim Allen) during a bar fight Mike gets embroiled in litigation showbiz and other blood sports. Mikes life is ruled by a code of honor but those around him dont play that way. He may be forced to literally fight back in a mixed martial arts bout. This is against his code ""Competition"" he believes ""is weakening."" Much of the Mamet gang is on hand (Ricky Jay Joe Mantegna Rebecca Pidgeon) while Emily Mortimer makes a welcome addition as a lawyer with a secret in a part that could have been beefed up with one more scene. The plot twists are hard to believe and the only thing putting off a climactic fight is Mikes abstract idea. But the movie marches on swiftly to the snare-drum rhythms of Mamets imitable dialogue ""You dont drink?"" someone asks Mike. ""I used to"" he responds. Does he train people to fight? ""No. I train people to prevail."" Mamet goes to the aphorism well and does he come back empty-handed? He does not. ""The best weapon in the world is a flashlight so you can look deep in the other guys eyes."" Sometimes Mamet cant resist pushing clever until it starts to push back A commentator at a televised match says ""I think boxing is as dead as Woodrow Wilson."" Might work if the movie were set in 1928. Amid much soldiery and scammery honor and dis- the breakage of will and bones Mamet (himself a jujitsu purple belt) boils up a typically strong brew of manliness and mystique. This isnt Mamet at his finest though which leaves us with a script that is merely three times as smart as the average feature. REDBELT Well fought. Running time 98 minutes. Rated R (profanity).

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday May 1 2008 530 PM Redbelt. Drama about a jujitsu teacher who gets caught in a shifty prizefighting circuit. With Chiwetel Ejiofor Tim Allen Emily Mortimer. Director David Mamet (139). At area theaters.The best films transcend their subject - any subject - to grab viewers who may or may not care about the starting point. Set in the gritty L.A. fight world ""Redbelt"" will fascinate those who share David Mamets interest in mixed martial arts. But its hold may be weaker on those who dont.An excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mike Terry a jujitsu instructor whose world is rocked when an emotionally distraught stranger (Emily Mortimer) shows up at his studio. One of Mikes students (Max Martini) is a police officer and when he tries to calm her she accidentally discharges his gun. No one is hurt but she destroys Mikes window. While trying to figure out how to pay for the damage Mike meets an aging action star named Chet Frank (Tim Allen in a role that should have gone to Bruce Willis). Chet admires Mikes moves and invites him to serve as a consultant on his upcoming film. Even their wives (Rebecca Pidgeon and Alice Braga) hit it off agreeing to work together on a clothing line. But only one thing counts in Mamets cruel world a signature on the dotted line. Mike is a man of deep honor so he assumes a handshake will close any deal. And his honesty has made him the perfect mark especially for the corrupt promoters (like Ricky Jay) who want him to start fixing fights. As writer and director Mamet seems to be using all the tricky complications of the plot as a laundry line on which to hang his passion for jujitsu. Ejiofor is good enough to keep us watching but the mounting cons feel increasingly empty. And the truth is that despite a gripping final showdown we could use more action too. This does seem to be a world Mamet knows well and every so often we see flashes of the great movie he might have made. But he never quite finds his focus and as Mike tells his students ""A man distracted is a man defeated.""

By Peter Rainer May 2 2008 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? David Mamet and jujitsu come together in ""Redbelt"" and the result is a draw. Chiwetel Ejiofor is the martial-arts instructor who refuses to commercialize his warrior code. Naturally its only a matter of time before we watch him duke it out in an Ultimate Fighting spectacular. In the movies pure-in-heart pacifists almost always take up violence as a way of renouncing violence. Mamet toys with this existential dilemma but his heart - or fist - isnt in it. (R for language.)

In the story of a purist-minded jiu-jitsu instructor trying to keep his distance from the vulgar commercialism of arena-style martial arts competition David Mamet may have found the ideal metaphor for his own relationship with mainstream Hollywood. An absorbing and colorful if not particularly convincing excursion into a demi-monde of fighters scammers promoters and self-styled modern samurai ""Redbelt"" gives the impression of Mamet coyly toying with the idea of making a populist little-man-against-the-system sports melodrama without actually attempting to create a film for the masses. Result offers solid midrange specialty-realm potential for this Sony Classics release which world preemed at the Tribeca fest. What keeps the film in Mamet rather than ""Rocky"" territory is that the heros motivations stem from intellectual and philosophical beliefs rather than from the emotional need to prove something to himself or a crass desire for fame and fortune. Master jiu-jitsu teacher Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor) aided by his wife Sondra (Alice Braga) struggles to make ends meet at his small academy in a seedy section of West Los Angeles. Mikes financial difficulties stem directly from his quasi-holy anti-mercenary beliefs. Operating in the enormous shadow of the Ultimate Fighting and mixed martial arts phenomenon Mike defiantly refuses to prep students for such contests. Fond of Eastern-style aphorisms he insists he does not teach pupils to compete. Rather ""I train people to prevail"" adding his belief that if your mental state is correct ""There is no situation you cannot turn to your advantage."" Mikes attitudes regarding control one-upsmanship and mental game-playing neatly tie in with motifs Mamet has employed many times before. But while the structure centered on protags becoming increasingly desperate as successive rugs are pulled out from under their feet is familiar the feel is different this time due to the physicality of the milieu. Downward spiral of events that sucks in numerous characters is triggered by a bizarre moment in which high-strung attorney Laura (Emily Mortimer) happens into Mikes place one evening and accidentally sets off a cops gun shattering the storefronts plate glass window. As a courtesy the cop Joe (Max Martini) agrees not to report it but his graciousness sets off a fateful chain of events that among other things backs Mike and Sondra up against the financial wall. At first Mike thinks he might find his way out of his desperate straits courtesy of movie star Chet Frank (Tim Allen) whose neck he saves one night at a bar. Smothering Mike with gratitude Chet invites him and his wife to dinner entices him with a big film job and sends him an expensive watch while Chets wife (Rebecca Pidgeon) embraces Sondra as a new partner in a fashion line. Mikes inherent goodwill soon puts him and Sondra deeper in the hole than ever leaving them at the mercy of some unsavory underworld types including a loan shark (David Paymer) and a fight promoter (Ricky Jay). Latter offers Mike a way to clear his debts by entering him in a televised martial arts tournament promising a 50000 payday. For a guy like Mike who even his wife admits is ""too pure"" for this world such a sellout is unthinkable. The way Mamet resolves this ""art versus commerce"" dilemma is almost too clever for the films own good suggesting that considering Mikes view of invariably being able to ""prevail"" if not ""win"" you can always find a way to have your cake and eat it too. Would that this were true and that the action-packed finale were more convincing and better filmed. Not only is the climactic turn of events unlikely but the coverage seems as hasty and haphazard as the impromptu event itself creating an uncertain tentative feel that emphasizes the storys status as an intellectual fairytale. Although the dialogue is far from Mamets pungent vulgar best the film is often engaging thanks to the storys varied social structure some solid individual scenes and a raft of fine actors playing tasty characters. The always impressive Ejiofor anchors the picture as the stoical Mike whose values just dont gibe with the omnipresent commercial juggernauts of big-time sports and Hollywood. Allen slips nicely if unexpectedly into Mamets universe as a celebrity accustomed to dealing with people who can be bought while Jay Paymer and Joe Mantegna the latter as Chets smooth front man reliably express the familiar moral contours of the everyday world as Mamet sees it. Pic looks sharp on a budget. RedbeltProductionA Sony Pictures Classics release. Produced by Chrisann Verges. Directed written by David Mamet.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review A Hero for Our Times Why Iron Man is an action magnet for liberals. Plus David Mamets sports flick. _ By David Edelstein Published Apr 28 2008 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) Every age gets not the superhero it deserves but the superhero it needs to ease its anxieties the midwestern farm boy who conquers metropolitan crime; the caped vigilante of the Gotham night; the tortured teen whose sticky excretions become a source of potency; the persecuted freaks whose differences empower them to save the normal folks. Now in Iron Man the first of the seasons megabudget comic-book spectaculars we get an American weapons mogul whose guilt over facilitating the deaths of U.S. soldiers and Mideast civilians impels him to turn off the arms pipeline and rescue Afghans from marauding warlords. The military-industrial complex ravages the Third Worldthen its former emissary swoops down from the sky in the guise of an impregnable weapon using his might (and money and American ingenuity) to undo the damage. Iron Man Akbar Its utter wish-fulfilling crap but when the whole world hates you it does feel good. Iron Man is a shapely piece of mythmaking. The director Jon Favreau doesnt go in for stylized comic-book frames at least in the first half. He gets real with ityoud think you were watching a military thriller. After jetting to Afghanistan to demonstrate a guided missile (which launches itty-bitty guided missiles) billionaire industrialist and conscienceless playboy Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) gets kidnapped by insurgents who blow up his convoy and kill his Army escort. He wakes up in a cave where a kindly Afghan civilian (Shaun Toub) has inserted a magnet in his chest to keep the shrapnel from drifting to his vital organs. The bad guys order Stark to replicate his super-duper weapon. But are they in for a surprise The robotic Iron Man has little in the way of an expression but his eye slots and the circular magnet in his chest have an unearthly glow and his coloring is warmgold and trimmed with red like a sunset. Favreau keeps cutting to Downeys big head bouncing inside the helmet somewhat offsetting our knowledge that the Iron Man itself is entirely computer-generated. His first liftoff and crash landing owe a lot to Brad Birds incomparable The Iron Giantalthough Favreau would probably say its an homage. At least he steals from the best. A movie like this is a sound designers wet dream thunk squish clank whir kaboom. The heavy-metal rock that kicks in when Iron Man appears is an aural pun that works like gangbustersalthough I wish there were a melody in there somewhere. BACKSTORY A film eighteen years in development Iron Man passed through several studios before Marvel bought the rights in 2006 and brought in Elf director Jon Favreau who plans to spin it into a trilogy. In a Yahoo Movies clip about the James Bondworthy set (perched on Point Doom overlooking the Pacific) Favreau zipping around on a Segway looks every bit as zhlubby as he did when he co-starred with Vince Vaughn in Swingers. In the movie itself he makes a cameo appearance as Tony Starks bodyguard Happy Hogan. First chapters of superhero sagas are more alike than unalike The hero tests out his new powers (painfully) amazes his friends and foes and makes his auspicious debut before the wider world. (What is it? Where did it come from? Is it friendly? Is there a franchise in it?) Then theres a villain who gets hold of the same technology and uses it for evil instead of goodthats Obadiah Stane played by Jeff Bridges with a little beard and a bald dome making his bid both for Starks superpowers and William Hurts hold on the ex-leading-man hambone character-actor market. The casting alone generates tons of goodwill. Who wouldnt root for Downey as a guy who has to clean up his act? His Stark is a sex addict a fast-talking heel whose jokes about his own irresponsibility are a hedge against growing up. Downey has such terrific instincts. He demonstrates his transformation by looking as if he has been yanked out of a blissful dream; his self-love dries up and so does his shtick. His loyal assistant Pepper Potts isnt much of a part but Gwyneth Paltrow is a presence. She stands around looking amused and flabbergastingly pretty slinging wisecracks with serene aplomb. Bridges makes Stane scarily at ease with his villainy. Hes an inspiring actor His movie-star vanity never gets in the way of his playing an asshole. Only Terrence Howard as Starks military liaison Rhodey seems ill used Hes perilously close to being Jim to Downeys Huck. Or maybe hes supposed to be Colin Powell. Blockbuster action movies often pick up on bad vibes in the air and transform them into something that lets us sleep better at night. In 1989 the same summer Spike Lee dramatized our seemingly unbridgeable differences in Do the Right Thing Hollywood gave us Lethal Weapon 2 in which an unruly white guy and a middle-class black family man collaborated to destroy the evil representatives of South African apartheid. Poofracial divisions melted away in a show of righteous force. Iron Man is more family-friendly but its in the same liberal-fantasy tradition. And dont misunderstandI loved it. Id so rather think about blockbusters than bunker-busters (or the Democratic primary). Its always fun to watch David Mamet Mametize another film genre the heist picture (Heist) the red-meat war movie (Spartan) and now in Redbelt the go-for-it sports drama. So hows the Mamet Rocky? Fast. Lively. In your face. Very watchable. And like its predecessors so bizarrely convoluted it barely holds together on a narrative level. But the underpinnings are consistent. As Mamet has evolved into a confident and resourceful film director his worldview has hardly budged. Whats changed is that his movie heroes manage to protect themselves from lifes inevitable betrayals. 1 2 Next Share this story...
