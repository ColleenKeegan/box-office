Whats most impressive about Roman Polanskis new adaptation is that it retains the books emotional punch and darker elements - the spectre of the gallows is a running motif - and presents them in a way likely to engage younger viewers without patronising them. From realist flourishes (the deterioration of Olivers feet as he hikes to London) to witty contrasts (the workhouse master spitting out a mouthful of food when Oliver asks for more) its a film that does its emotional work through bold resonant image-making.Tracing the young orphans progress from workhouse to the East End slum where he falls in with Fagin the Artful Dodger et al Ronald Harwoods adaptation is an efficient trim-job initially picaresque then streamlining the narrative (and excising the fairytale genealogy). Visually the film takes its cue from the George Cruikshank caricatures and Gustave Dore engravings associated with the novel offering a heightened picture-book feel. Varnished but still grubby its backstreets are ripe with squalor its impeccably cast villains no less menacing for being faintly clownlike Mark Strong shines briefly as toothy flame-haired dandy Crackit and Jamie Foreman makes a suitably snarly Sykes. But clownlike need not be pantomimic as Ben Kingsleys centrepiece turn as Fagin demonstrates. Jocular ringmaster and exploitative arch-opportunist hes never sympathetic but always compulsively watchable - especially when at his literal wits end in the climactic jailhouse reunion with Barney Clarks Oliver. Its a truly pitiable scene that makes clearer the films connection to Polanskis earlier work. As in Rosemarys Baby Chinatown The Pianist and others Polanski presents a threatening rotten world as viewed through the eyes of a vulnerable innocent; he tackles jealousy suspicion and corruption as surely in storybook mode as through suspense investigation or horror.

"Straight-Arrow Oliver Twist washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Straight-Arrow Oliver Twist Ben Kingsley left is Fagin in Roman Polanskis ""Oliver Twist"" with Barney Clark as young Oliver. Jamie Foreman below plays the sadistic Bill Sikes. (Photos By Guy Ferrandis -- Tristar Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 30 2005 Roman Polanskis ""Oliver Twist"" is a high-toned handsomely mounted scrupulously literate adaptation of a beloved classic novel. I hate high-toned handsomely mounted scrupulously literate adaptations of beloved classic novels. On the surface theres absolutely nothing wrong with this most recent version of a book that has undergone countless big- and small-screen interpretations. But the fact that theres nothing wrong with it -- that theres nary a scenic detail or scrap of dialogue or performance that isnt utterly on the nose -- is precisely whats wrong with it. ""Oliver Twist"" which was published in 1838 has become such an essential part of Western literary lore and culture that it scarcely needs retailing but in short The title character a 10-year-old orphan living in a squalid Victorian workhouse embarks on a journey to London where he comes under the tutelage of a pickpocket named Fagin and after a robbery goes awry is subsequently taken in by a wealthy man named Brownlow. Incensed Fagins most sadistic protege Bill Sikes kidnaps Oliver and the boy becomes the object of a fierce metaphorically rich struggle between two archetypal father figures. The best-known film adaptations of ""Oliver Twist"" of course were David Leans 1948 film starring Alec Guinness as an unforgettable Fagin and Carol Reeds 1968 musical simply titled ""Oliver"" Polanskis ""Oliver Twist"" is an entirely creditable addition to that mini-pantheon featuring a sound script by the redoubtable Ronald Harwood (who wrote Polanskis last film ""The Pianist"") a fruitful visual collaboration between cinematographer Pawel Edelman and production designer Herve de Luze and solid performances by Ben Kingsley as Fagin Jamie Foreman as Bill Sikes and newcomer Barney Clark as young Oliver. Although Polanski has taken some liberties and compressed some of the original text the story remains unsullied; indeed every character on screen seems to have leapt directly from Dickenss pages from Kingsleys leering grimy old hunchback (whose hooked nose stands as a reminder of the anti-Semitic roots of the character) to the Christian hypocrites who run Olivers orphanage whose caricatured girth swells to Brobdingnagian proportions. And not a stitch has been dropped in lending Olivers picaresque Victorian verisimilitude from the sadomasochistic austerity of the workhouse to the dreary distressed quarters where Fagin and Sikes ply their unsavory trades. And yet. Polanski has constructed his ""Oliver Twist"" with such lavish attention to detail and such reverence for the book that the production is rendered inert an effect that is only heightened by the computerized insertions of things such as sunrises and St. Pauls Cathedral into scenes that look as if they were filmed in Backlottingham-on-Thames. (In actuality ""Oliver Twist"" was filmed on location in the Czech Republic.) Indeed had this production of ""Oliver Twist"" been directed by any other filmmaker -- or at least one without Polanskis knack for both taste and toughness -- it could easily be regarded as a respectable if not earth-shattering depiction of Dickenss lively literary world. But because its Polanski and because viewers have come to expect the unexpected from him ""Oliver Twist"" circa 2005 seems to lack what made Dickens such a master in the first place his own willingness to experiment with satire social commentary and narrative form. Polanskis connection to the novels themes of abandonment and isolation is unmistakable (his parents were prisoners in Nazi concentration camps and his mother died in one); in an eerie way Clark even resembles a 10-year-old version of the director. But Polanskis strict reading of the text keeps him from plunging head-on into its most painful psychological even political implications. At some point the obsession with production values and note-perfect performances actually distances viewers and the filmmaker from Dickenss most potent indictments. Indeed as they watch yet one more tableau vivant of aestheticized cruelty and violence (Sikess brutal murder of a prostitute named Nancy is kept discreetly offscreen) filmgoers may be forgiven for thinking that to really bring Dickens to cinematic life in the 21st century what is needed isnt one more well-heeled costume drama but an enterprise as bold and confrontational as the original work. (Heaven knows that our own ""filthy wicked world"" to coin one characters phrase is rife with enough pious hypocrisy poverty and exploitation to provide some provocative analogies.) As tetchy and quibbling as it sounds ""Oliver Twist"" finally is too good; its been produced with such care and virtuosity and integrity that it resembles one of the stippled engravings featured in its opening credits. Its noble high-minded and safe and I cant help thinking that I would have preferred an audacious but honest failure. Oliver Twist (130 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for disturbing images.

Starring Barney Clark Ben Kingsley Jamie Foreman and Leanne Rowe. Directed by Roman Polanski. (R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Charles Dickens  ""Oliver Twist"" has been made and remade several times over but this time its personal. Roman Polanski who was stranded in Paris without his parents during World War II clearly understands the predicament of the title character an orphan in Victorian England. Personal experience doesnt cause the director to emphasize the biographical parallels nor does it lead him into subjectivity or sentimentality. On the contrary Polanskis firsthand knowledge that such things can really happen to a boy results in a grounded and unusually matter-of-fact adaptation. People who like their Dickens served up with big chunks of ham may be disappointed by Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwoods approach. Here the characters are as big as life but not bigger than life. Even the presentation of the outlandish Fagin is just this side of caricature with Ben Kingsley presenting this monstrous figure as having a certain delicacy and humor. Polanski does justice to Dickens moral universe in which the motives and worldview of even the worst people are made comprehensible. If theres a weak link in the film its Barney Clark the 11-year-old schoolboy that Polanski tapped to play Oliver. One would think this would be a major flaw At the center of the film is a character who doesnt exactly grow change or develop who is something of a cipher in Clarks rote child-actor performance. Yet surprisingly this hardly matters. The essential thing is that Oliver look thin angelic and pathetic which young Master Clark accomplishes just by standing there. With Oliver surrounded by sinister adults all Polanski has to do is cut to Clark looking mournful and innocent and the emotional point is made. Its never difficult to tell the good guys from the bad guys in a Dickens story. With magnificent economy he gets us hating the right people. Oliver newly orphaned is brought to a workhouse in the opening moments where the boys slave for long hours and go hungry while the company directors stuff their faces and instruct the boys to pray for their exploiters. Cruelty alone would be easier to accept. But when its mixed with moral surety hypocrisy and a professed Christianity (distorted and inverted beyond recognition) its nothing less than maddening. And thats just in the first five minutes. From these early scenes Polanski lets the audience know it is in expert hands. In most films its possible to tell the minor from the major characters straight off simply by noting the attention that theyre given and the quality of the acting. But here the casting of even the tiniest roles is careful and meticulous. The actors have faces straight out of a Victorian engraving and each characters complexity is conveyed with a few brush strokes. The foreman of the workhouse for example is only given two or three lines but with only that the actor (Andy de la Tour) and Polanski tell us all we need to know about this mans hardness of heart and his remaining traces of humanity. That bad people are never entirely bad (though some come close) is best exemplified by the ever-fascinating Fagin the miser and exploiter of children who trains boys to become pickpockets and then lives off their labors. In his greed and his ambition to thrive on child labor Fagin -- a bent grotesque figure with rotting teeth and straggly hair -- is no worse than the people in respectable society and his flat to which Oliver is brought by a young thief known as Artful Dodger is at least lively and affords the boys some freedom. When Oliver arrives there it feels as though hes landed and it comes as a relief. Fagins criminal associate Sykes is more conventionally brutal and ruthless but as played by Jamie Foreman even he has moments of pensiveness and self-questioning. As Nancy the prostitute who takes a sympathetic interest in Oliver Leanne Rowe is lovely a young earth mother with lots of integrity exactly what the role requires. Young Harry Eden as Artful Dodger gives a mature adept performance full of emotion and physical grace. He has the skills Barney Clark lacks and could have used. To Clarks credit however he does rise to the occasion late in the game when Oliver visits Fagin who is in the midst of a mental breakdown. Every eye in the theater will be on Kingsley but spare a glance for Clark. He loses his stiffness and becomes spontaneous and natural. Suddenly hes not bad at all. -- Advisory This film contains disturbing images and violence.

"Left twisting Please Mr. Polanski we dont want more - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Oliver Twist Left twisting Please Mr. Polanski we dont want moremovies - reviewSeptember 30 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticRoman Polanski continues the cinematic penance he embraced beginning with The Pianist in Oliver Twist a grim grimy and grimly faithful adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel.But if hes atoning for the sin (statutory rape) that keeps him from returning to America or guilting us over the misery that was his life leading up to that crime why does it feel as if were the ones doing time? In Oliver Twist its the viewer who is punished.Weakly cast in the childrens roles performed in an archaic English slang that renders most of the dialogue indecipherable and packaged in a humorless pallor its a Twist in dire need of a few well twists.Barney Clark is the shy angelic child made up as Oliver. When another character describes his Oliver -- ""Theres a melancholy to his face"" -- you can see why he was cast. It certainly wasnt for his acting. Hes the worst child actor since that Star Wars kid.Oliver is an orphan sent first to the workhouse and then apprenticed to an undertaker who flees and joins Fagin (Ben Kingsley) the Artful Dodger and friends as a London pickpocket. Fate intervenes to have him adopted by a wealthy old man but he is dragged back into the gutter by his ""friends.""Olivers struggle against the magical promise of his future and the relentless grip of his past has the makings for a fabulous morality tale with its tweaks on class a callous state and the horrors and the hypocrisy of child-rearing practices of the day. When Oliver rebels against his oppression its because hes no longer starving. Hes been fed enough to think such thoughts proclaims Bumble his parish-appointed ward.""This comes of being liberal"" shouts the venal undertakers wife recoiling in horror.Dickens didnt invent childhood. But he shamed much of the world into not using children as chattel or slave labor. Or starving them.Polanski of course gets this political subtext.The filmmaker is so intent on the murky look and sound of the era that he loses the thread of Dickens and the moralizing is lost in the still-compelling gloom of early 19th-century England.Ben Kingsley goes all out as Fagin one of the great criminal caricatures of literature. Pity we cant understand much of what he says. He is meant to be the counter-force to the liberal charity of those who rescue Oliver the short brutal and criminal life beyond the law that awaited a poor boy with no parents or prospects.That too is lost in this emphasis on milieu. Yes it looks like 1830s England if you dont spot the blurry matte paintings that make Prague pass for Dickens London.The real tragedy is that a generation of children hoping to dodge the pages upon pages of Dickens wandering fertile imagination are deprived of that movie-going shortcut to great literature. Theyll have to put off that book report and wait for the DVD like the rest of us. At least the closed captioning will tell you what everybody said.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Its a steep challenge reclaiming ""Oliver Twist"" from the bloated comforts of dinner theater where overemoting actors must shout and cackle to be heard over the clatter of steam-table lids. Olivers tale is so familiar by now after so many tellings on film TV and the stage of your local country playhouse we need major persuading to open our hearts for the little orphan once again. Roman Polanski is certainly the director to try. A victim and scholar of strife and heartache Polanski could have made Oliver as haunting as his 2002 Academy Award-winning film ""The Pianist."" Yet his new effort falls just short. Its as if Polanski were torn between making a fairy tale for his young children and freshening an object lesson for adults. ""Oliver Twist"" flip-flops uneasily between the jaunty notes of a plucky boy and the screeching horror strings of evil grown-ups. Polanski ends on the right tone a dim glimmer of dawn after a terrifying night. But he has to twist his own earlier intentions to get there. ""Oliver Twist"" was Charles Dickens most strident demand to shrink growing class divides in 19th- century Britain. Oliver is raised at a workhouse orphanage after the death of his mother and forced to pick oakum from frayed rope hour after hour. Polanski makes the orphanage officials ruddy buffoons but they are horrid and deserve a hearty flogging. The other boys treat Oliver badly too forcing him to make the famously suicidal claim for more porridge at breakfast. One problem for any Oliver adaptation is that the titular boy is a fairly dull character. Things happen to the lad but he doesnt do much; he is polite and bland while everyone around him is sinister and interesting. He was Dickens dewy-eyed kitten poster for world reform and yet you cant hang a whole movie on him. Barney Clark won the part with an appropriately cherubic face but without having to do much in the actual film. ""Oliver Twist"" then becomes a showcase for showy adults with rich parts like Fagin the wretched old thief who coddles runaway boys in London but puts them in harms way to steal precious goods. Ben Kingsley here offers one of the finest Fagins ever making the nearly broken man touching right up to the moment he twists the knife in his friends backs. Jamie Foreman also does yeomans work making chief thug Bill a wretched menace. A trap for Polanski and other adaptors is what to do with Bills doomed girlfriend Nancy. Shes the only one in the entire story who goes out of her way to do the right thing and is murdered for her trouble. Shes then quickly forgotten in favor of recounting the fate of the band of boy criminals under Fagin. It may seem a small point to say Polanskis sets are too clean and well-made but it goes with the complaint about tone. In re-creating the foul streets of London Polanski gets the shape right without throwing on enough dirt. Dickens was a master at shaming the public with a brutal view of its own decay. Too often this ""Oliver Twist"" looks like the Disney version of splintered rails and rancid streets. The lack of atmosphere lets the adults bluster unconvincingly as if they are just playacting at being mean until somebody in the 20th century forces them to play nice. When Polanski turns out the lights near the end he takes it even further than some of the more pessimistic versions of ""Oliver."" We visit a deteriorating Fagin on death row as they build the gallows just outside the window and Kingsleys desperation is brutally honest. Polanski is right in that some children can handle the old-fashioned dark fairy tales but this scene is powerfully disturbing and parents are forewarned. I know Im sounding as unpredictable as Fagin himself Is the movie too light or too heavy? A little of both and in more than one wrong place. The next version of ""Oliver Twist"" calls for a young director full of anger and bile. Dickens deserves someone retelling the classic story as full-on nightmare instead of ultimately reassuring daydream. One rescued orphan still leaves behind a dormitory full of unhappy truth.

"Oliver Twist | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; oliver-twist ) Oliver Twist (United Kingdom/Czech Republic/France/Italy 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli You know theres a problem when the most interesting character in a film called Oliver Twist is a supporting woman named Nancy. Technically sound and surprisingly faithful to its source material Roman Polanskis version of Oliver Twist comes across as uninspired and flat. Only two performances - that of Leanne Rowe as Nancy Sikes and Jamie Foreman as Bill Sikes - have energy. The biggest deficiency is Barney Clark whose performance as the title character vacillates between befuddlement and artificial weepiness (rarely have I seen more crocodile tears). For the story to work sympathy with Oliver is mandatory but Clarks acting and Polanskis direction keep the character at arms length. I cared about Nancy and wanted Bill to get his comeuppance but Oliver seems inconsequential. At its heart Oliver Twist is a story of misery relieved by the occasional expression of kindness. Its one of the novels that feeds into the term ""Dickensian."" Olivers life is tragic. He begins the story at an orphanage but is soon kicked out for bad behavior. His next stop is working for a coffin-maker but mistreatment causes him to run away. After a cruel seven-day trek to London he meets Artful Dodger (Harry Eden) and becomes one of the merry band of thieves ruled by the avaricious Fagin (Ben Kingsley). A chance encounter with a wealthy businessman Mr. Brownlow (Edward Hardwicke) gives Oliver a chance at a better life but Fagin and his cutthroat associate Bill Sikes are unwilling to let him move on. They find a way to pull him back in and use Mr. Brownlows affection for Oliver to their advantage. Only Nancy Bills wife shows compassion for poor Oliver. Polanskis interpretation is very much a Masterpiece Theater style adaptation. It looks good and hits all the high points but is cool and unemotional. Dickens was an excellent writer of melodrama. Tears while reading his books are common. But not so with this version of Oliver Twist. And while there is humor in the book and humor in the movie the two dont always occur in the same places. There are times when Oliver Twist is unintentionally farcical which is a bad thing. It shatters the tone. But the period detail is impeccable (or at least so it seems to an untrained eye). As I mentioned the acting standouts are Leanne Rowe whose list of previous credits is small and Jamie Foreman a familiar character actor who was most recently seen as The Duke in Layer Cake. Bill is fearsome a true cinematic villain and Foremans performance stands alongside any of the greats who have played the part in the past. Would that the same could be said of Ben Kingsley. Alec Guinness fans need not worry. Kingsleys campy interpretation of the storys most diabolical character comes close to character assassination turning Fagin into a bumbling sniveling wretch. The definitive filmed version of Oliver Twist remains David Leans 1948 edition. Polanskis new adaptation comes close only in the way it looks. In every other aspect it is inferior. Even the pace is off. Parts of 2005s Oliver Twist rush by in an instant making it apparent that things were cut or condensed. Other parts of needlessly prolonged leading to audience disinterest. As an introduction to the story for someone with no previous exposure to Oliver Twist Polanskis movie is adequate. And Dickens ""completists"" will also want to see it. For everyone else however the appeal is as limited as the directors shortsighted vision.

Why produce yet another version of this old warhorse which has already been adapted more than 20 times for film and television? Besides with his mammothly coincidental plots and two-ton sentimentality isnt Dickens hopelessly out of fashion - especially for a twisted cynic like Polanski?These judgments reflect a fundamental misreading of both Dickens and Polanski. Dickens of course although addicted to the cause of happiness is among the darkest of novelists; its no accident that Dostoevsky was profoundly influenced by him (especially ""Oliver Twist""). And Polanski as ""The Pianist"" so fervently demonstrated has a vast fund of human sympathy.So its no surprise (at least to me) that his ""Oliver Twist"" is altogether remarkable a near-masterpiece. In a way its as personal a film as ""The Pianist"" and I would guess for the same reason It taps into his own memories of childhood abandonment. (His parents were deported from Krakows Jewish ghetto to Nazi concentration camps). Polanski has said that he wanted to make a film that ""his kids could somehow identify with."" He must respect his children a great deal because he has fashioned a movie that gets very deep inside the terrors and frailties of boyhood. Nothing in this movie condescends to young imaginations no treacle coats the imagery. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? George Gissing in his essay on ""Oliver Twist"" wrote that ""the novelists first duty is to make us see what he has seen himself whether with the actual eye or with that of imagination and no one ever did this more successfully than Dickens in his best moments."" Polanskis ""Oliver Twist"" has that same fevered veracity. All of the familiar scenes are here The starving orphaned Oliver (Barney Clark) risking the wrath of his overseers at feeding time by asking for ""more""; Olivers introduction to the lair of street-gang leader Fagin (Ben Kingsley) with his depraved jollity and cunning; the murder of the prostitute Nancy (Leanne Rowe) - Olivers one true friend in the abyss - at the hands of the pulverizingly brutal Bill Sikes (Jamie Foreman). The net effect is nothing so simple as a parade of Dickenss greatest hits. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Polanskis film is the first to truly put forth the dark derangement of Olivers world and it is this passion for emotional honesty which binds the famous scenes into a flowing whole. (Ronald Harwoods adaptation wisely jettisons many of Dickenss voluminous subplots). What gives the film its distinctive dread is that stylistically Polanski keeps the horrors tightly controlled - which makes them seem even more horrible. When Nancy is murdered the blood pooling under her door is far more chilling than a full frontal depiction of the killing could ever be.Another great distinction of ""Oliver Twist"" is Polanskis affinity for the sweetness of redemption. Most movies derived from Dickens founder whenever virtuousness intrudes; the bad guys are simply more intriguing more camera-worthy than their saintly counterparts. But Polanski doesnt sentimentalize the dark side because he knows too well what a blessing happiness can be. The ""good"" people in his movie such as Nancy or the benefactor Mr. Brownlow are flesh-and-blood human beings not angels of mercy.Even Fagin a character notoriously derived from the anti-Semitism of Victorian England is given his due. Ben Kingsley gives a magisterial performance in which Fagins humanity bursts forth from the caricature. His final scene with Oliver where the valiant boy expresses gratitude to the crazed soul before his execution is as harrowing as anything Polanski has ever done. In that moment Fagin receives his benediction and Oliver who apprehends the complexity of goodness becomes a man. Grade A Rated PG-13 for disturbing images.Sex/Nudity 2 scenes of innuendo. Violence 20 scenes including many fights. Profanity 5 mild expressions. Drugs/cigarettes/alcohol 7 scenes of smoking 9 scenes with drinking.

The London that Polanski reconstructs (in Prague) is a fetid heartless place that must be navigated by wits not maps. And as if to prove it the director propels his action up and down stairs through dank streets and even across rooftops often in the dark or in the rain. The grimy pint-size pickpockets Oliver falls in with have the crazed hardened look of children ripped from childhood too soon and their scaly handler the sniveling Fagin (Ben Kingsley) is appropriately decayed all bent of nose (with Semitic intimations) and mossy of teeth. When Fagin clutches Oliver played by angelic-looking newcomer Barney Clark in a gnarled gesture of possessiveness (and in Kingsleys nuanced portrayal warped love) the contrast between the rotten ""Jewishness"" of the old man and the Christian luminosity of the boy couldnt be more acute. Yet precisely because this is by Roman Polanski its irresistible to read his sorrowful and seemingly classical take from a filmmaker known as much for the schisms in his personal history as for the lurches in his work as something much more personal and poignant. As in his previous movie The Pianist (also written by Harwood) Polanski here considers the case of a person shaped (or is it misshaped?) by a fate over which he has no control. Like the musician played by Adrien Brody Oliver survives by chance. Some people Polanski darkly observes are good others are bad. But most like Fagin are mutants strangled combinations of both.

Sony/TriStar will have no trouble positioning this as a prestige fall release but B.O. looks to moderate levels. Without his name on the credits it would be difficult to identify the latest version of ""Oliver Twist"" as the work of Roman Polanski. Conventional straightforward and very much within what used to be called the Traditional of Quality this handsome film is a respectable literary adaptation but lacks dramatic urgency and intriguing undercurrents. Coming off the directors Oscar win for his last film ""The Pianist"" Sony/TriStar will have no trouble positioning this as a prestige fall release on ramp-up to its Sept. 23 opening but storys modest impact in this umpteenth screen retelling looks to limit B.O. to moderate levels. Just as Polanski was drawn 27 years ago to Thomas Hardys ""Tess of the dUrbervilles"" for the opportunities it provided to meaningfully embellish a story designed to express the arduousness of life so one could imagine that he would be drawn for similar quasi-autobiographical reasons to Dickens tale of an orphan boy forced to make his way in a treacherous world. The biggest surprise then of his ""Oliver Twist"" is that it seems so impersonal. In fact its very close to what a director such as William Wyler or George Cukor might have done with the story in the Hollywood of 70 years ago albeit not as colorfully acted. And it doesnt approach the impact of the dark version David Lean directed in 1948 a film that for long stretches resembles silent cinema and one that was so controversial for its characterization of the Jewish villain Fagin that its U.S. release was delayed for three years and then came out significantly cut. Rather than as a tapestry of lifes trials and tribulations Polanski and his ""Pianist"" scenarist Ronald Harwood approach the classic tale as something of a boys adventure yarn. Dispensing with the harrowing episode of Olivers birth and his mothers death pic opens on Olivers arrival on his ninth birthday at the workhouse where he joins dozens of other youths doing menial labor until hes exiled for his presumptuous request for more gruel at mealtime. After a disagreeable spell working for an undertaker Oliver makes his way on foot to London where hes quickly taken under wing by the Artful Dodger top boy among the pre-pubescent lads working as pickpockets for the sniveling devious Fagin. Hunched over dressed in layers of rags with matted reddish hair and missing several teeth Ben Kingsleys creation looks a fright (and would assuredly smell even worse) although he is decidedly without the exaggerated hooked nose and nasal intonations that made Alec Guinness interpretation in the Lean version so invidious to some. So although Fagin technically retains his place as a criminal Kingsley and Polanski appear most interested in attempting to humanize him to argue that even though he takes advantage of his boys and makes them break the law this might be preferable to their fates if they were left to their own devices on the streets. In the service of this view Kingsley does a fine job instilling Fagin with a certain feebleness and insecurity that make him more pathetic than hateful. Unfortunately its a level of performance unmatched by most of the other actors. In any Dickens adaptation one expects a raft of fabulous supporting actors to flesh out the authors inimitable characters. Oddly Polanski has chosen to employ little or unknown thesps a tactic that can work when surprise or lack of previous associations are important but which has an indifferent effect here. Leanne Rowes doomed Nancy breaks through with a few markedly emotive moments while others are adequate but unexceptional. Crucially Barney Clark is disappointingly wan and unengaging in the title role giving the film a hole in the middle; when he disappears for a spell in the latter-going its a bit of a relief. Professionally but without inspiration pic reenacts the key scenes that will be familiar to many via the book previous film and TV versions and/or the musical. Saved for the very end the most interesting scene in that it has appeared in none of the other prominent versions of the story and attempts to cast its principal characters in a fresh moral light shows Fagin in prison just prior to his execution. Oliver insists upon paying a visit to forgive this half-insane ""wretched man."" Pic conveys the impression of Polanski coasting through this one rather than investing much of himself or injecting it with the unmistakable personal touches that reliably marked his earlier work. Shot in Prague on extensive sets its a good-looking enterprise outfitted with detailed production design and costumes. Rachel Portmans score hits the dramatic musical cues with frequent obviousness. With its PG-13 rating film is probably a bit strong for kids much under that age.
