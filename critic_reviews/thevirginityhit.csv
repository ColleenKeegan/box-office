JOHNSON  Post-Dispatch Pop Music Critic  kjohnsonpost-dispatch.com  314-340-8191 Sep 24 2010 (...) Columbia Pictures The Virginity Hit Mock documentaries typically work well in the horror genre. But the new mockumentary ""The Virginity Hit"" is a horror movie of a whole other sort.The teens in this super-bad ""Superbad"" wannabe have one goal for Matt (Matt Bennett) to have sex. Thats it. Many good movies have been made on such a premise from ""American Pie"" to ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" but ""The Virginity Hit"" isnt one of them. The film is shot with handheld cameras to give it a low-grade ""realistic"" look with unrecognizable actors. The crude action is played out via characters cell phones cameras and through YouTube.The situations Matt encounters -- including a ferocious bout of diarrhea during a date with Nicole (Nicole Weaver) and a funny moment with a blowup doll -- have promise. But as played out here situations feel muzzled. If ""The Virginity Hit"" had been filmed as a straightforward sex comedy it couldve been a riot.Producers Will Ferrell and Adam McCay should know better.

Its four guys one camera and their hilarious experience chronicling the exhilarating and terrifying rite of passage losing your virginity. Starring Matt Bennett Zack Pearlman Director Andrew Gurland Huck Botko Running time 126 Release Opened Sep 17 2010  Editorial Review Losing it in a YouTube worldBy Michael OSullivanFriday September 17 2010""The Virginity Hit"" is a comedy that looks like a documentary but plays like a horror film -- to parents of teenagers. The parade of inappropriate adolescent behavior is enough to give nightmares to almost anyone with a kid and to make some of those who havent spawned yet consider getting their tubes tied. Shot to look as if the whole movie had been cobbled together from camcorder footage taken by a bunch of randy YouTube-obsessed kids -- in other words shaky under-lit and characterized by dialogue thats frequently inaudible except where sexually preoccupied -- the movie purports to be the actual story of four actual high-school-age friends Zack (Zack Pearlman) Justin (Justin Kline); Jacob (Jacob Davich) and Matt (Matt Bennett). One of the films few likable characters Matt is also the lone virgin among them. Hes on a quest to lose his virginity to his girlfriend of two years Nicole (Nicole Weaver) thereby entitling the two of them to share a celebratory bong hit. Hence the films title which has nothing to do with box-office optimism. If there were justice in the world -- and there isnt -- the film would quickly crawl back under the rock whence it came. But I digress. Early in the film Matt and Nicole break up. That sets the stage for further misadventures in his effort to ""do it"" with any of an assortment of girls and young women including his adoptive sister (Krysta Rodriguez); a 25-year-old he meets on the Internet who isnt exactly who she says she is (Savannah Welch); and Matts favorite porn star (real-life porn star Sunny Leone). I know classy. Its ironic that the films moral -- its best to lose your virginity to someone you love -- comes from the porn star. That breakup takes place after a disastrous second-anniversary date in which were treated to the sounds of Matts nervousness-induced diarrhea. The audio and video -- which Zack subsequently posts online -- comes courtesy of recording equipment that Zack and his voyeuristic pals have rigged up in the hotel room where Matt and Nicole are intending to give themselves to each other. Boundaries? We dont need no stinkin boundaries Thats the films conceit that kids today are so comfortable exposing themselves to their Facebook ""friends"" (and millions of other strangers) and that reality TV and YouTube have made the documentation of peoples lives so commonplace that nobody under the age of 18 would bat an eye about being followed around by someone with a camera 24 hours a day. Written and directed by Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland ""The Virginity Hit"" uses that concept to sell the audience on the gimmick that the film is somehow real ""found"" footage a la ""The Blair Witch Project."" Its not of course but it turns out to be an interesting topic for a conversation about the zeitgeist -- not to mention a much scarier movie.Contains pervasive crude language and sexual humor shoplifting under-age drinking nudity and drug use.

The Virginity Hit Losing your virginity and also your soul | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Virginity Hit Losing your virginity and also your soulThe Virginity Hit is a charmless and soulless attempt to make a real-life version of such cherry-popping teen comedies as Superbad and Porkys.Matt Bennett plays one of four horny teens in this unfunny feature.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Sept. 16 2010 The Virginity Hit (out of 4) Starring Matt Bennett Zack Pearlman and Nicole Weaver. Written and directed by Andrew Gurland and Huck Botko. 86 minutes. At AMC Yonge-Dundas. 18A Recipe for boredom and possibly despair Take four affluent horny and immature teens. Add a cheap video camera or three. Stir in dollops of cruelty vulgarity and misguided parental consent. The nasty result is The Virginity Hit the best argument yet why YouTube novelties were never meant to run at feature length in theatres or to be taken seriously. Its a charmless sadistic and utterly soulless attempt to make a real-life version of such cherry-popping teen comedies as Superbad Porkys and American Pie but the comparison does a disservice to those pictures. Closer analysis shows theres really nothing real about it at all. Four New Orleans teens -- brothers Matt (Matt Bennett) and Zack (Zack Pearlman) and best friends Jacob (Jacob Davich) and Justin (Justin Kline) -- make a bong-boosted pact to lose their virginity. The results will be documented by Flipcam clips posted directly to YouTube with the sniggering Zack being the de facto director. Everyone is quickly successful in their sex quests except for dweeby Matt who looks as if hes trying to ape Jay Baruchels character in Shes Out of My League. He just cant seem to close the deal. When it seems that Matt might implausibly finally score with his out-of-his-league girlfriend Nicole (Nicole Weaver) he discovers that shes been somewhat less than faithful to him. Rather than talking things over with Nicole to get the truth the lads proceed to set up a video sting operation aimed at humiliating her. If Matt can somehow get laid in the process so much the better. The ensuing rush of predictable gross-out gags ranges from documenting Matts first condom purchase to his humiliating experiences with an Internet hottie of dubious intentions. No intimate moment or bodily function is left unattended and no feelings are spared. Occasionally a parent will show up to do something witless. None of it is original. Little of it is funny. All of it is shot in grainy video and shaky-cam which could have you lurching in your popcorn or sprinting for the exits. Its sad to think garbage like this gets released when so many good movies languish on the shelves looking for a distributor. If this story were a genuine teen comedy along the lines of Superbad and the rest it might be merely okay. But its actually a con. It only pretends to be based on reality adding another layer of exploitation to this sorry enterprise. The only thing real about it is the studio money and marketing behind it. The film was written and directed by Andrew Gurland and Huck Botko the pens behind the recent horror hit The Last Exorcism. If only we could hire an exorcist to stop the coming plague of movies like The Virginity Hit.

Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 17 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Sep. 16 2010 231PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Virginity Hit Written and directed by Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland Produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay Starring Matt Bennett Zack Pearlman Jacob Davich Justin Kline and Nicole Weaver Classification 18A The biggest lie perpetrated by The Virginity Hit the story of four teenage boys who take to a bong every time one of them loses their virginity is that the first three losers somehow gain access to the magic water pipe. Zack is a flabby camera-wielding stalker with a voice like a seagull. Justin has yet to manufacture a chin. And Jacob is a simpleton. Yet the film asks us to believe that months after signing their pact the trio all bed scrumptious babes. The Virginity Hit is another slice of American Pie one more youth comedy that encourages its cast (and audience) to ridicule a fumbling well-meaning teenager. This time out that would be Matt the fourth teenager a kid too noble to enter easily into a sexual relationship. Talk about encouragement - its pandering really - the film even rewards its audience for identifying with Matts tormentors by offering hot proxy girlfriends. The Virginity Hit is different from the American Pie series in that its staged as a mockumentary. Sniggering Zack follows Matt around with a film camera hoping to catch him in flagrante delicto. Alas the first time the chubby redhead catches his friend with his pants down Matt is suffering from diarrhea - in an episode that makes it to YouTube. Later hes captured on camera with a hermaphrodite love doll. And so on. And so on. None of this is the least bit funny. Or in any way entertaining. Its just another teenage-clown-in-a-dunk-tank flick. Everyone fire away. Whats so galling about Zack and Justin Make a Porno is that the film even lacks the courage of its perversions. In the end Matt does the right thing going back to his sweetheart girlfriend Nicole. Were even encouraged to believe ultra-obnoxious Zacks family are sweethearts. Matts mother died of cancer you see. Zacks parents adopt the little dickens loving him as if he were one of their own. That Will Ferrell and his long-time creative partner Adam McKay have produced this disagreeable on-the-cheap mess makes it all the more deplorable. Filled with rookie actors a scant 88 minutes long and filmed on the gallop with digital cameras The Virginity Hit was produced on a shoestring budget of 2-million U.S. Itll probably make that back its first weekend. Ferrell and McKay are probably thinking franchise. American Pie had three sequels and as many spinoffs grossing more than 750-million. We can only hope that for The Virginity Hits inevitable sequel Virgin Spring Break Hit Me Again Ferrell and McKay hire another creative team and a whole new company of actors.

The story about the last of a quartet of high school buddies to lose his virginity (and thereby win the privilege of a ceremonial bong hit) is presented in the guise of amateur videos that are being posted on YouTube. When the on-screen high jinks are sufficiently embarrassing the videos go viral.Unfortunately the things that can be funny and even lib- erating in a movie like ""American Pie"" end up looking coarse and slightly depressing in the scripted pseudoreality of ""The Virginity Hit."" Scenes that need to be over the top -- the blowup doll the room of eavesdropping friends -- remain earthbound at least in the hands of the writer-direc- tors Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland and their anonymous young cast. Photo Matt Bennett and Nicole Weaver in ""The Virginity Hit"" a deflowering comedy. Credit Patti Perret/Columbia Pictures An unexpected thing hap- pens though after Matt (Matt Bennett) botches the deflow- ering of his willing girlfriend Nicole (Nicole Weaver) the movie takes a serious turn -- Matt needs to learn a few les- sons before getting his second chance with Nicole -- and suddenly starts to work. The cam- era settles down the performances become more relaxed and believable and several adult actors in supporting roles are given the time to make an impression particu- larly John McLeaish as the creepy-funny proprietor of a New Orleans bed and breakfast.Though ""The Virginity Hit"" counts Will Ferrell among its producers it was originally made for 150000. Its interesting to note that even at that budget level the women in the film are so much more attractive than the men that in real life they wouldnt be caught dead in the same room with them much less having sex.THE VIRGINITY HITOpens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.

But despite its vulgarity that 90s sex comedy knew where to draw the line. The Virginity Hit doesnt. Its crass senseless and consequently void of humor. Movie Information The Virginity HitRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Andrew Gurland and Huck BotkoStarring Matthew Bennett Zack Pearlman Jacob Davich Justin Kline and Krysta RodriguezRun time 86 minutesMPAA rating R (strong crude and sexual content nudity pervasive language drug and alcohol use)Synopsis Four friends chronicle their attempts at losing their virginity.More movies from GuideLive.comThats unless you find the glamorization of theft drugs sex alcohol porn and prostitution in the context of underage teens inspiring and funny. In fact its easier to side with the films antagonist a grad student who exploits the central character for the animal he is.The Virginity Hit is about four friends who vow to have sex before high-school graduation. Matt a skinny nerd with curly hair and thick glasses becomes the lone virgin of the pack - and the subject of a documentary filmed by his best friend Zack a ginger Jonah Hill caricature.Matts friends do everything in their power to make sure he scores after Matt misses a chance to have sex with his girlfriend of two years. This leads to the desperate teen looking for sex in all the wrong places and people an online stranger his at-the-time-drunk adopted sister and his favorite porn star who will evidently do the deed if the money is right.If this is an honest portrayal of American adolescence were in trouble. These youths are heartless morons dropping profanities as if their lives depended on it and treating sex as if it were a game in which young girls bodies are the prize.Perhaps The Virginity Hit could have been successful if it satirized such juvenility. Alas the tone never implies anything is wrong with these privileged predators. It authorizes males to treat females as if they arent real people with faces and feelings.Though undeniably convincing with innovative camerawork and honest improved performances theres no value to be found in this alleged comedy. It concludes with some words about saving your virginity for someone you love but the film as a whole doesnt coincide with that message. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Its more like "" Porkys for Dummies a thoroughly depressing teen farce in which Internet voyeurism has replaced human intimacy and where privacy is so 20th century.The mockumentary conceit is that were watching the handheld videos of Zack (Zack Pearlman) a fat obnoxious New Orleans high schooler intent on documenting his nerdy best friend and adopted brother Matt (Matt Bennett) as the latter goes about losing his virginity. Matts the last one in the crowd to go; the title refers to the righteous ceremonial bong hit hell take upon attaining manhood.Theres a long-suffering girl-friend named Nicole (Nicole Weaver) whom Matt sets up for global Internet humiliation after learning she may have been unfaithful; the scene makes you cringe for everyone involved. Zack subsequently tries to hook his friend up with an online hottie (Savannah Welch) whos not what she seems and then with Matts favorite porn star Sunny Leone (played by porn star Sunny Leone) who ironically is the most appealing and natural person in the entire movie. All of the zany shenanigans go out on YouTube and are commented on by a universe of digital kibitzers.This implies ""The Virginity Hit is the new reality Everything is theater everythings a joke and the jokes on you. It might work as satire and there are one or two moments where Botko and Gurland let slip how shallow and sad they think their characters actually are but theyre too afraid of alienating the only demographic that might pay to see this rancid meta-farce. (Hate to break it to you guys but most of your audience will be watching the pirated copy they got off LimeWire.)One of the problems with ""The Virginity Hit is that everyone in it is hateful especially the two leads who come across as Jonah Hill and Christopher ""McLovin Mintz-Plasse from ""Superbad recast as charmless dolts. The supporting roles and extras male and female alike have the dull entitled stares of mall-fed cattle. The one character who doesnt seem stupid or drunk is the girlfriend and for that shes punished.The larger problem is that the movies portrait of a generation neurotically obsessed with broadcasting and watching itself is funny only if you work really hard not to think about it. Give the matter even a seconds contemplation and it feels like the death of the soul. But thats giving ""The Virginity Hit more power than it deserves Its just a crasser-than-usual sex comedy aimed at an audience that has never had sex. Ignore it and with any luck itll crawl off and die.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

The Virginity Hit (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Virginity Hit (R) Teen-sex comedy is a bonafide original Matt Bennett and Nicole Weaver in The Virginity Hit. (Columbia Tristar) Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald9/15/2010 Editor rating 3 Like practically every teen-sex comedy ever made The Virginity Hit centers on one young mans first quest to get past third base. Skinny gawky Matt (Matt Bennett) is the only one of a group of four friends who hasnt gone all the way although his longtime girlfriend Nicole (Nicole Weaver) is willing and a date for the big ceremony has been set. But Joseph Campbell was onto something when he said a heros journey is never easy and Matt soon discovers that losing his virginity will be harder than pulling Excalibur from its stone. As his pals (Zack Pearlman Jacob Davich and Justin Kline) shadow him with video cameras documenting even TMI moments that would better have been unshared The Virginity Hit becomes a YouTube riff on the American Pie genre - a shaky-cam Cloverfield / Blair Witch Project take on teen hijinks. The Internet is a veritable supporting character in the film. The result is far funnier and much less annoying than you might expect. Filmmakers Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland use the hand-held camera angle ingeniously (even if they occasionally cheat) and you cant always tell if the people who appear in the film are in on the joke such as an overly friendly hotel manager who encourages the boys to trash one of his rooms. The lead actors mostly unknown are utterly convincing as hormonal mischief-prone teens acting and speaking the way real adolescents do. And the movie comes up with some hilarious original scenarios (Will Ferrell and Adam McKay served as producers) that dont remind you of any other teen comedy which is no small feat. The only way to tell The Virginity Hit was scripted and not entirely improvised are the situations in which the protagonists find themselves whether trying to steal an expensive suit from a Ralph Lauren store or attempting to crash a college frat party. The movie also sneaks in surprisingly poignant moments such as a sequence in which we learn that Matts mother died from cancer and his drug-addict father wiped out his college fund to fuel his habit (the kids payback on the deadbeat dad is more than justified). Although its central premise could not be more hackneyed The Virginity Hit still feels fresh and inventive. When you think back on it you dont remember these friends as fictional characters. Instead you think of them as real people. Not a single beat in the film feels contrived or false. Everything that happens could conceivably happen to anyone with friends like these. In the case of the poor perpetually humiliated Matt though better him than you. Cast Matt Bennett Zack Pearlman Jacob Davich Justin Kline Nicole Weaver Krysta Rodriguez Seth Barrish. Writers-directors Huck Botko Andrew Gurland. Producers Will Ferrell Adam McKay Chris Henchy. A Columbia Pictures release. Running time 85 minutes.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Truth Or Dare Warren Beatty famously observed that his then-girlfriend Madonna was so addicted to fame and public adulation that she didnt want to live off-camera. Today--between Twitter YouTube and other outlets--Madonnas purported attitude is the rule rather than the exception. Like the forthcoming documentary Catfish the new teen sex mockumentary The Virginity Hit chronicles a generation socialized to consider their lives entertainment. And like the recent horror hit The Last Exorcism which was scripted by The Virginity Hits writer-directors Andrew Gurland and Huck Botko the film takes the form of a faux-documentary filmed by portly film-obsessed suspiciously Jonah Hill-like pal Zack Pearlman. The mockumentary format lost its freshness decades ago but it perfectly suits an exploration of a form of narcissism unique to the YouTube generation. And along with the absence of familiar faces it helps give Virginity Hit a loose feel and a jolt of verisimilitude. Scrawny hero Matt Bennett a trembly-voiced alumnus of the Jesse Eisenberg/Michael Cera school of adorably deer-like delicate masculinity stars as the sole holdout among four friends whove made a pact to smoke the eponymous bong hit once theyve lost their virginity. Bennett plans to lose his to his impossibly perfect girlfriend of two years. But when he discovers shes dallied with a frat boy Bennett and his friends hatch an ill-fated revenge plan that backfires and leads to Bennetts first heartbreak. A mad dash ensues as Bennetts pals try to help him get laid a process full of detours and dead-ends involving Bennetts frisky adoptive sister an online seductress whos too good to be true and a surprisingly game porn star. The process of coming of age and entering the world of adult sexuality is often defined by tenderness and vulnerability two qualities sorely lacking in most teen sex comedies. But The Virginity Hit gleans a surprising amount of pathos and emotional resonance from the scars Bennett incurs from the ugly public dissolution of his high-school romance. No matter how raunchy the film gets Bennett never lets us forget that his character is in profound pain even while attempting to perform oral sex on a transsexual blow-up doll. Its a daring sweet performance that almost single-handedly elevates The Virginity Hit from a standard Superbad knock-off into a film that feels raw painful and real.

Sign up for our Newsletters. Daily Edition Login to download The Virginity Hit -- Film Review 1013 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Frank Scheck  AP FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Empty TWITTER Empty Essentially the first feature-length YouTube video ""The Virginity Hit"" updates the horny-teenager movie to the Internet era. Its not surprising that Will Ferrell and Adam McKay are among the films producers as the comedy essentially plays like an elongated version of something you might see on their Funny or Die website. Director-screenwriters Andrew Gurland and Huck Botko are no strangers to the mockumentary format; their credits include the cult film ""Mail Order Wife"" and screenplay for ""The Last Exorcism"" in theatrical release. Inspired by the types of routinely humiliating online videos that probably have scarred innumerable psyches this relentlessly vulgar comedy revolves around the efforts of a group of teens to help their nebbishy buddy Matt (Matt Bennett) lose his virginity after an ill-fated attempt with his sexually frustrated girlfriend Nicole (Nicole Weaver). The friends are driven because their video documentation of Matts failed try -- including his horrendous bout with explosive diarrhea -- inadvertently becomes an Internet sensation.The chief novelty and conceit is that the story is told entirely through shaky handheld video footage giving the proceedings an all-too-familiar ""Blair Witch Project"" feel. The results are only partially successful. While younger electronically weaned audience members no doubt will embrace the stylistic approach the screenplay lacks the wit necessary to distinguish the film from the countless randy-teenager movies that have preceded it. And one would-be comic high point depicting an episode of man-on-man testicle grooming is an exact retread of a similar gag from the recent ""Shes Out of My League."" Still the film offers enough raucous laughs to please its target audience and for once the youthful ensemble cast actually looks and acts like real gawky teens. With the careful handling and astutely targeted marketing ""Virginity"" might attain the cult status it so clearly seeks.Opens Friday Sept. 10 (Columbia)Production Gary Sanchez Prods.Cast Matt Bennett Zack Pearlman Jacob Davich Justin Kline Krysta Rodriguez Nicole Weaver Harry Zittel Savannah WelchDirector-screenwriters Andrew Gurland Huck BotkoProducers Will Ferrell Adam McKay Chris Henchy Peter Principato Paul YoungExecutive producer Owen BurkeDirector of photography Luke GeissbuhlerEditor Geoffrey RichmanRated R 86 minutes FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Frank Scheck THRnewsthr.com thr AP THRnewsthr.com thr Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter (c) 2016 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

Can it now do the same thing for teen raunch? The Virginity Hit2010-09-25Sony Pictures Entertainment Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr TOUCHED FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME Matt Bennett and Nicole Weaver in The Virginity Hit. (Patti Perret) B- The Virginity Hit Director Huck Botko Andrew Gurland; Author Huck Botko Andrew Gurland; Release Date Wide 09/10/2010; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted September 25 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Super-low-budget shaky-cam faux reality has made its mark on horror films. Can it now do the same thing for teen raunch? The Virginity Hit is a smirky-naughty horndog youthsploitation comedy about a dweeb trying to lose his virginity. The movie has full-frontal nudity lots of R-rated body-part talk and the kind of outrageous-but-not-too-outrageous everydude spirit that made The Hangover a hit. This one though was shot on a shoestring with a handheld camera a no-name cast and a plot that seems to make itself up as it goes along. It should have been called The Bare T-s Project. The co-writer-directors Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland (they wrote the screenplay for The Last Exorcism) are shrewd commercial operators who are out to do something fresh (sort of). The Virginity Hit is a patchwork of American Pie and a hundred familiar losin-it/road-trip/beer-bong comedies and its often just as synthetic as any of them. Except that the cast gets some room to improv and the home-video style -- call it blockbuster mumblecore? -- works cleverly because it emerges right out of the everyones-an-exhibitionist YouTube age. This is a tale of young men who literally cant help but expose themselves. Matt played by Matt Bennett (the actors all use their real first names) looks like a runt Jason Biggs and hes the only one of his quartet of friends who is still a virgin. Yet hes got a real hottie of a girlfriend Nicole (Nicole Weaver) -- the first tip-off that the films ""reality"" is dosed with Hollywood fantasy -- and he has planned out the night theyre going to sleep together in a ritzy bed-and-breakfast as if it were a graduation ceremony. Thats why his buddies secretly hook up speakers and hang out in the next room listening in and giggling (along with half a dozen eye-candy girls who are in there with them). At this early point I sort of hated the movie. It wasnt remotely believable so what was the point of staging the cheeky-corrupt peep-show slapstick in a verite style as if that would somehow fool us into buying it? The magic sex evening does not go well. Nicole gets dumped for being unfaithful and Matt now free attempts to solve his big problem any way he can. Thats when The Virginity Hit sort of kicks in. With Matts predicament revealed in an embarrassing video on YouTube an innocently dangerous-looking 25-year-old sex freak (Savannah Welch) gets in touch with him via the Internet wanting to sleep with him. And this we can sort of kind of believe. To comply with the swingers wishes he has to buy an expensive Ralph Lauren suit and shave his private parts and theres a desperation to all of this that hooks the audience right in. The big date isnt just funny -- it has the urgency of a comic horror film. It makes you remember how far a teenage boy will go when hes decided its time to liberate himself by being bad. The Virginity Hit is hit-or-miss. The road-trip stuff doesnt really work; a raucous frat party does. The movies dirty banter walks a thin line between funny and stagy but Botko and Gurland showed brash instinct when they recruited the real-life porn star Sunny Leone to appear as herself. Shes supposed to be Matts favorite adult-video actress the one he thinks hes in love with and the way the movie builds to their dweeb/sex goddess encounter feels right. It gets at how the porn industry has colonized boys erotic dreams. Will The Virginity Hit be a one-shot? Or in its homemade-Porkys way could it be revolutionary? At the very least maybe its about time that a movie with this many masturbation jokes proved that you could do it yourself.

"Virginity Hit The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; virginity-hit-the ) Virginity Hit The (United States 2010) September 09 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Virginity Hit takes the first-person pseudo-documentary approach popularized by horror films such as The Blair Witch Project and applies it to the coming-of-age/teen comedy genre. Perhaps surprisingly it proves to be a good fit although questions still remain about the ""authenticity"" of some footage given its candid nature. Still its easy enough to suspend disbelief when most of whats on screen shows the apparent cinematic aptitude of Uncle Bills home movies. In this case the excuse is that were watching the YouTube-focused output of three teenage boys as they chronicle the misadventures of the fourth member of their group as he attempts to lose his virginity. Its kind of a low-budget grungy looking Superbad without the stupid cop stuff. The ""mockumentary"" film is no stranger to co-writers/directors Andrew Gurland and Huck Botko. Gurlands first film 1998s Frat House was an underground genuine documentary. Subsequent to that he and Botko teamed for a couple of shorts then produced the mockumentary Mail Order Wife. The Virginity Hit is their second feature together. They are also credited as the writers of the recent horror film The Last Exorcism which was filmed in a similar manner. Theres little doubt these two are enamored with this story-telling technique. It also attracted the attention of Will Ferrell and Adam McKay who are on board as producers (although contrary to some erroneous reports neither appears on-screen). Matt (Matt Bennett) Zack (Zack Pearlman) Jacob (Jacob Davich) and Justin (Justin Kline) are best friends. One-by-one over a one-year period each loses his virginity... until there is one. Its not that Matt doesnt have prospects but he wants everything to be perfect before doing the deed with his long-time girlfriend Nicole (Nicole Weaver). Then just when the big event is at hand Matt learns that Nicole may have cheated on him and his whole world collapses. Following Nicoles betrayal Matts life becomes all about losing his virginity but should he accept a proposal from an Internet girl (Savannah Welch) who promises unforgettable sex if hell buy a 1700 suit? Or would it be better to stay close to home and spend a night with his adopted sister Krysta (Krysta Rodriguez)? (This possibility raises the question if its really incest when theres no blood connection.) Or should he spend the money necessary for a fling with his favorite porn star Sunny Leone? As Matt weighs these possibilities Zack helpfully records everything using his portable camera and posts the most memorable and embarrassing moments to YouTube for the entire world to see. As one might expect from a film that deals with a characters attempts to lose his virginity (not exactly an original topic for a coming-of-age film by the way) a lot of the humor is on the raunchy side. Some of the material is amusing although nothing quite reaches the laugh-aloud level attained by ""groundbreaking"" sex comedies like American Pie. Theres a predictable amount of gross-out humor although its not graphic (we only get the audio not the video). Arguably one of the funniest sequences occurs when Matt shaves his pubic region. We get a full view of whats going on although theres blurring around the genitals. Also although theres a fair amount of nudity the guerilla filmmaking style often makes it difficult to catch more than a random glimpse of various body parts. The actors most of whom are unknowns are credible. Matt Bennett has a part that Michael Cera would have played had this been a higher profile production and he out-Ceras Cera playing the likeable somewhat dorky ""average guy."" How he ends up with a hot girlfriend like Nicole is never adequately explained. Zack Pearlman has the Jonah Hill role and like Matt Zack is also blessed with a good-looking girlfriend. The most interesting and energetic performer is Krysta Rodriguez whose character is so appealing that were almost willing to overlook the ""incest factor"" and hope she ends up being the one to solve Matts problem. The actor with the most credits to her name (by far) is real-life porn star Sunny Leone who does a believable job with her clothing on (although her topless scene is the longest and clearest offered by the filmmakers). The Virginity Hit is fresh unpretentious fun but the comedy is so raw that it will appeal only to those who appreciate this sort of unfiltered peek into the mind of males in their late teens and early twenties. The movie will probably not age well since its the kind of thing whose reliance upon social fads will date it. (With so much reliance on YouTube imagine how this will look to future audiences once YouTube is passA(c).) The gonzo approach makes everything a little more real however and this gives life to the characters and makes the more outrageous comedic sequences seem a little less off-the-wall. Future generations may view The Virginity Hit as a curiosity but todays audiences provided theyre primed for the subject matter and the manner in which it is presented should enjoy the hell out of it.

Equal parts bold experiment (in sustaining a YouTube aesthetic for an entire film) and shallow redux of well-worn teenage sex comedy tropes ""The Virginity Hit"" reps a regression for producers (and Funny or Die honchos) Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. Returns for the Columbia release should be decent enough though split sharply on generational lines Those with the stomach for 90 slapdash minutes of nonstop crudity and cruelty will be tickled while their elders will likely despair at these youngsters lack of a moral center or ability to hold a camera steady. Shot entirely on handheld digital cameras and edited like a series of Internet video clips the pic has a simple premise Four New Orleans-based YouTube-obsessed teenagers -- adoptive brothers Matt (Matt Bennett) and Zack (Zack Pearlman) and best friends Jacob (Jacob Davich) and Justin (Justin Kline) none of whom are distinguished much beyond their obnoxiousness and propensity for extreme on-camera oversharing -- make a pact on a female-shaped bong that they will mark the losses of their respective virginities with a celebratory hit. Opening montage shows the latter three commemorating their first conquests while uber-nebbish Matt hopes to complete the quartet with girlfriend Nicole (Nicole Weaver). When word reaches the boys that Nicole has been cheating they plan a videotaped comeuppance that would likely get them arrested in any recognizable universe and that backfires entirely. Now fueled by a desire for revenge as well as lust Matt embarks on a furious series of follow-up efforts to cash in his V-card -- with a porn star a suspiciously available stranger and even his adopted sister -- egged on and sabotaged all the while by the borderline sadistic camera-wielding Zack. The hijinks and humiliations that ensue in writer-directors Andrew Gurland and Huck Botkos pic are undeniably lurid but theres an inescapable sense of joylessness to the endless procession of teenage drinking drug-taking grainy nudity and hard-R sex talk. Superior films of this type (""Superbad"" ""American Pie"") may contain just as much debauchery but theyre grounded by the notion that much of this boorish behavior is predicated on teen boys loneliness insecurity and boundless sexual confusion. Granted few softer qualities to mitigate their all-consuming lust and hostility ""The Virginity Hits"" heroes simply come across as heartless sexual-predators-in-training. Nor are things helped by the disconnect between the films verite aesthetics and the preposterousness of its story The protags seem to have limitless access to money hotel rooms expensive video equipment and hot girls willing not only to sleep with them despite their charmlessness and bad skin but also to share the details on YouTube clips. On a technical level the pic is more watchable than its videoclip gimmick may suggest with some well-framed high-quality digital shots creeping in among the cameraphone jumbles though most viewers eyeballs will be exhausted before the end.
