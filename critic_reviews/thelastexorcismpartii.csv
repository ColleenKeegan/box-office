His naturalistic approach showing everything from the psychically distorted point of view of Nell (Ashley Bell) somehow sucks the life out of the still promising material. Pallid Bell exudes fragility and vulnerability as Nell who is the sole survivor of the first film. She now lives in a New Orleans halfway house for troubled teenage girls blissfully unaware that the video recording of her earlier ordeal has gone viral on YouTube. Yet even as innocent Nell edges towards sanity - kissing a boy listening to the Devils music and wearing lipstick for the first time - she is still assailed by nightmares hallucinations and demonic voices. The Southern Gothic atmosphere of backwoods Louisiana has been replaced by lazy tourist shots of New Orleans while the disturbing hints of rural incest have given way to a drippy teen romance and ghostly appearances by Nells dead father - warning that all will be lost if the demon Abalam succeeds in seducing her. Apart from some glancing hints of the symbiotic relationship between the smitten demon and the not-so-naive Nell Part II wholly lacks the originals provocative sexual and religious ambiguities. By the time the kamikaze crows start dive-bombing the church windows and the shape-shifting demon appears in a hoody and a Venetian carnival mask the whole thing has degenerated into a mumbo jumbo gumbo.

In ""The Last Exorcism"" (2010) this Louisiana teenager was possessed by the demon Abalam and ultimately bore his progeny only to have their unholy offspring disposed of by solemn hooded attendants. In ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" she has survived that ordeal unlike her father (or so it appears) the documentary crew filming her and the minister of lapsed faith who attempted to coax out her tormentor.Now shes in a house for recovering trauma patients in New Orleans and Abalam has again come a-courting. But only indirectly making overtures through greasepainted human statues (the kind in Times Square) birds hitting windows voices hidden in radio static and the ubiquitous presence of insects. (Clearly ""The Last Exorcism"" was a misnomer.)Nells roommate Gwen (the very interesting though very underused Julia Garner star of the coming ""Electrick Children"" a hit at South by Southwest) isnt much help with Nells suitor. But a hardy group of demon-relocation specialists (including E. Roger Mitchell) gives it a shot.""The Last Exorcism Part II"" belongs to a flourishing genre you could call terror tease. Devoid of nudity gore and obscene dialogue PG-13 films like the ""Paranormal Activity"" series and the first ""Last Exorcism"" eschew graphic violence for mood and minor scares -- perfect for Friday-night mall outings without Mom and Dad. If only they gave you more to think about.At least this movie like its predecessor has Ashley Bell as Nell. An actress who suggests religious piety carnal fire and satanic aggression with equal dexterity Ms. Bell provides a pulse an audience can connect with amid the standard-issue atmospheric accouterments.""The Last Exorcism Part II"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for mild violence and brief strong language.

Never mind the inherent titular redundancy ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" is a generally effective sequel to the 2010 sleeper that injected at least a little new life into the heavily taxed found-footage-horror subgenre. That film found a preacher trying to disprove the reality of exorcisms by filming a fake one only to be fatally caught up in an actual demonic visitation; this follow-up from a largely new creative team finds the originals central victim pursued to New Orleans by the same malevolent spirit. Despite considerable competition this weekend the pic should easily scare up the numbers to justify a third installment. After a brief recap of prior events -- all caught on video by the doomed camera crew now dead along with the protags family -- the pic drops the found-footage pretense for a more conventional omnipotent p.o.v. and production polish. The promisingly scary first scene has a couple (Boyana Balta Judd Lormand) unpleasantly roused at home in the wee hours by an intruder who turns out to be none other than failed exorcism and coven-ritual subject Nell (Ashley Bell). Turned over to the authorities near-catatonic with trauma shes hospitalized and for lack of any surviving relatives placed in Devereaux House a ""transitional home for girls looking for a fresh start."" Kindly manager Frank (Muse Watson) advises her to accept that whatever happened to her was the work of evil humans not devils and that she alone decides her fate from now on. After a couple of months shes doing very well getting along with the other girls notably new best friend Gwen (Julia Garner); working as a hotel housekeeper; anticipating a first-ever boyfriend in co-worker Chris (Spencer Treat Clark); and otherwise enjoying life in the big city after a very sheltered rural upbringing. But ominous visions return including visits by the late dad (Louis Herthum) who warns her the demon ""Abalam"" is still in hot pursuit of her soul and more ""If he can seduce you hell be free."" Eventually she turns for help to members of a ""good"" occult group the Order of the Right Hand Path leading to a new rather more paganistic exorcism climax. This is the most head-on but also perhaps the weakest setpiece here as director/co-writer Ed Gass-Donnelly fares best building dread and atmosphere. The more explicit its terrors the less potent the pic becomes and the finale paints the series into a bit of a corner as it will take considerable ingenuity to keep Nells predicament interesting now that shes undergone a fundamental change. Theres also a certain monotony that creeps in once its clear that virtually every sequence is going to lead up to some scare leaving little room for more than rudimentary plot or character detail. The approach leaves Bell so affecting in the first film (but at 27 now clearly a bit long-in-tooth to play a 17-year-old) stuck playing too many scenes on or over the edge of hysteria. Still she retains an appeal distinct from the standard-issue genre damsel in distress. Also in contrast with the first pic none of the supporting characters develop any complexity here. Nonetheless ""Part II"" is above-average PG-13 horror and coaxes quite a bit of tension out of its waking-nighmare scenario via lensing (Brendan Steacy) and editing (Gass-Donnelly) that constantly suggest something awful is about to materialize or spring from behind a corner. Locations and production design are handsome (though thats one awfully posh halfway house for girls) with one nice segment making aptly spooky use of Mardi Gras-type street festivities.

"Possessive case Last Exorcism returns without the novelty - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Possessive case Last Exorcism returns without the novelty Share Tweet Bcom - Article MobileFriendly - Methode Share Tweet By Ethan Gilsdorf Globe Correspondent | 03.04.13 | 1111 AM With Pope Benedict stepping down just before its opening ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" couldnt be better timed. ""Without the pope there"" said coproducer Eli Roth (""Hostel"") in a recent interview ""a lot of people feel that a gateway to evil will open up."" Plus 42 percent of Americans believe in demonic possession. And its Lent. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters That said this films target audience probably isnt so much unnerved devout Catholics as it is anxious teenage girls of all faiths. According to ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" being possessed by the devil is just another way of talking about the perils of emerging female sexuality. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Thats one way to read this sequel to 2010s hit ""The Last Exorcism"" a ""Blair Witch""-like faux documentary about possession which ended with young Bayou farm girl Nell Sweetzer (possibly) freed from the demon Abalam and several other people coming to an untimely end. Ashley Bell reprises her truly convincing and remarkable performance again bringing her fragile avian-like demeanor to portray a girl now on the cusp of womanhood. ""Part II"" finds doe-eyed Nell in a New Orleans home for troubled girls run by kindly father-figure Frank (Muse Watson). ""Its your fate"" Frank advises. ""You get to decide who you are."" Or can she? The world overwhelms her. A co-worker at the motel where she works wanting to be her boyfriend is a threat; so is a sexually suggestive voice on the phone. New girlfriends at the home are competitive and suspicious even as they offer a hand of friendship. ""Are you from some cult in the woods or something?"" one resident challenges. In a clever nod to our viral world the homes girls view footage from ""The Last Exorcism"" on YouTube. As Nell wrestles with recurring hauntings -- buzzing flies convulsing bystanders visitations from her dead father -- the question of feminine authority and the historical baggage of female hysteria is the subtext. Are her troubles psychological or supernatural? That provides tension for about half the film. The Mardi Gras backdrop with its masks and costumes offers another metaphorical layer about identity. Fresh-meat director and co-writer Ed Gass-Donnelly (""Small Town Murder Songs"") wisely loses part ones mock-doc look and feel. Hes not afraid to lock down his camera but his story cant quite live up to the creepy novelty of part one directed by Daniel Stamm. Once the ""what is real what is fantasy"" questions are answered and exorcism part deux commences ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" abandons its half-intelligent tender exploration of Nells vulnerability and desirability. We end in flames flies and rock n roll. And Nells fate naturally is left uncertain. Look for that to be answered in ""Part III Return of the Pope.""

Thursday March 14 2013 at 4 a.m. By Simon Abrams When the creators of The Last Exorcism Part II swapped pseudo-verite realism for psychological realism they made it a lot harder to take their franchise seriously especially now that you get a good look at actress Ashley Bell who reprises her role as Nell the possessed victim of demonic rape. Most of Part II follows Nells attempts to overcome her fears of being attacked by the demon Abalam again. Throughout Abalams role as the negative psychic residue of the otherwise neurotically sheltered Nells first hormonal stirrings (boys) is overstated. Various well-meaning but incompetent parties offer Nell help like her equally inexperienced boyfriend Chris (Spencer Treat Clark) her fair-weather teenage gal pals and the ghost of her abusive father who keeps trying to caress Nell and then shoot her. Nobody really cares about Nell as nobodys observant enough to notice how shaken she is by Abalams conspicuous visitations like when Nell has a vision of her father being eviscerated by one of her new friends then-possessed by the demon. The films supporting characters are only distracted by Nells behavior long enough to gawk at her. Everyone is insensitive for no good reason depriving Nells hormonal problems of any psychological weight. The original films jump-scare chills similarly dont work now that minus its found footage pseudo-documentary style you can actually see the monsters jumping out of the shadows.

The Last Exorcism II review An exorcise in futility | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Last Exorcism II review An exorcise in futilityThe Last Exorcism II with its ordinary scare tactics is a sequel that doesnt measure up to the original.Ashley Bell returns to star as Nell in The Last Exorcism II.  (PATTI PERRET / ALLIANCE FILMS)  By Josh TapperNews reporterSat. March 2 2013The Last Exorcism IIStarring Ashley Bell Julia Garner and David Jensen. Directed by Ed Gass-Donnelly. 88 minutes. Now playing in major theatres. 14AThe Last Exorcism II begins with a snappy montage of the blood-soaked events that occurred in its predecessor a moody found-footage horror that followed the possession of a Louisiana teenager named Nell Sweetzer.Its not a bad way to start any sequel remind viewers of what came before and hope memories of good beginnings envelop them enough to soften the blow of whats to come.Article Continued BelowThe first film (2010)The Last Exorcism (2010) was full of tightly coiled jolts serving up enough genuine frights to earn it a place alongside The Exorcist and The Exorcism of Emily Rose in the pantheon of movies about waifish white girls under demonic control. But the sequel employs a disjointed melange of rote scare tactics that trod the film along to a disappointed exorcism climax in which viewers are taunted with the possibility of witnessing a possessed chicken.The Last Exorcism II which was released Friday and wasnt pre-screened for critics picks up with Nell (again played with chilling effect by Ashley Bell) living in a New Orleans halfway house where she seems to have rid herself of the demon Abalam who possessed her in the first film. Soon enough however the demon reappears turning the perky Nell into a terrified wreck.The movietrades in narrative currency common to the horror genre asking the audience to wonder if the events are actually happening or if theyre merely inventions of a psychologically damaged young woman.For much of the film which was directed by Toronto-born Ed Gass-Donnelly and produced by Eli Roth Nell is resolute in her disbelief that Abalam exists. But her change of mind -- defensible perhaps considering the random slayings nightmarish visions and voices coming through crackling radio frequencies -- is underdeveloped lacking the conviction needed to drive the plot toward another exorcism attempt.The flaws in the narrative are fatal no doubt but fans of the first film will be disappointed to find the bloodshed is minimal this time around; violence largely occurs off screen or in split-second cuts a move the filmmakers likely took to score the more accessible 14A (PG-13 in the U.S.) rating which often helps at the box office.The Last Exorcism took in 40 million off a 2-million budget. These days that kind of profit automatically ensures a sequel even when the title of the original film does its best to insist one is enough.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"The Last Exorcism Part II delivers more horrors - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview The Last Exorcism Part II delivers more horrorsAshley Bell again stars as Nell but the unnerving sequel takes a more conventional approach to demonic possession than the first film.March 01 2013|By Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times Ashley Bell returns as Nell in ""The Last Exorcism Part II."" (Patti Perret CBS Films )""The Last Exorcism Part II"" is an effectively unnerving slow-burn supernatural horror tale. The film is smartly different enough from the original to survive on its own though it lacks some of the first films sense of surprise.Rather than the disorienting reversals of the first film a a faux documentary in which a team looking to debunk demonic possession comes across a story they cant explain away a ""Part II"" takes a conventional approach (no fake doc no found footage) to its story. It picks up with the girl from the first film Nell (Ashley Bell) seemingly free of the demon who possessed her and entering a transitional group home in New Orleans where she can try to build a new life. (Footage from the original film exists online within the world of the second labeled ""crazy girl possessed in woods."")The sequel is directed by Ed Gass-Donnelly who co-wrote the screenplay with Damien Chazelle. (Chazelle previously made the winsome jazz musical ""Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench"" which seems as unlikely a horror audition piece as one can imagine.) Both the first and second films are rated PG-13 but somehow the new film feels softer.The first film was more messed up existing in the register of crazy and had a sexualized energy that is largely neutered in the second. A moment in the new film when a character slashes his own throat is handled in a way that is too discreet and bloodless robbing the moment of its most visceral shock.Just as in the first film much of what works best in the new movie is thanks to Bell. She has an uncanny quicksilver ability to flash between naivetA(c) and a knowing darkness. Her physical contortions arent used as much this time but there is still a strong physicality to what she does.Overlooking the semantic peculiarity in the title ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" a the inevitable sequel might be called ""The Final Exorcism Again"" a this movie isnt a waste of time.

(CBS Films.) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday March 1 2013 706 PM Title The Last Exorcism Part II Film Info A young girl again resists the demon that possessed her. With Ashley Bell. Director Ed Gass-Donnelly. (128) PG-13 Scares jolts. Area theaters. The fact that ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" the sequel to the surprise horror hit of 2010 is relatively meditatively sedate for most of its run time should be considered a blessing. This is a genre that of late has thrived on jolting viewers in the simplest ways possible and then draping it all in ""found footage"" to make it seem of-the-moment and (far from) chicly meta. But this sequel takes a different approach. Opening snippets fill us in on the events of the last movie a young girl squirrelly ashen redhead Nell (Ashley Bell) was taken over by a demon in her rural southern house; a camera crew and several family family members fell prey to the demon called Absalom and a monsterous birth resulted. The camera crew fled as camera crews are wont to do. Now a suddenly reappeared Nell finds herself at a halfway house for girls in New Orleans. She comes out of a coma-like state and asks if shes dead. (If she is at least there are therapists in the afterlife.) She slowly comes out of her shell shocked state and makes friends with a few of the other lost souls there (Julia Garner Sharice A. Williams). Smiles start to creep back onto her face. But strange things are happening Strange figures watch over Nell at a Mardi Gras celebration; radios and telephones crackle and call to her; walls spackle and crack in front of her. She has visions of the father she thought had died and at night she has a nasty habit of suspending from the air like a broken marionette. Director Ed Gass-Donelly taking over from the original films Daniel Stamm clearly wanted to infuse his film with some of the disquieting feel of classic movies like ""Dont Look Now"" or ""The Omen"" where lit empty rooms held as much threat as darkened ones. Good on him; even in a world where flicks like ""Mama"" make big bucks the horror gods tend to favor people who want to throw whatever they can at the screen. But Gass-Donnelly understands that his best special effect is Bell herself. A Sissy Spacek-looking beauty with the angular face and old-fashioned feel of a Depression-era Walker Evans photograph the young actress -- who impressed last year in the apocalyptic thriller ""The Day"" -- is double-jointed and uses that skill more sparingly than in the big set pieces of the previous ""Exorcism."" She successfully makes Nell skittish and endearing; at one point during an exercise at the girls home to write a letter to ""someone who hurt them"" Nell writes ""Dear Absalom Ive decided youre not real."" Shes the movies center and holds it. Unfortunately it would all be more interesting if Absalom really wasnt the issue; if Nells mental state say was the battle ground instead of her soul. But even horror films that try something new have to be dragged int the morass sooner or later and once the serious screaming starts ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" becomes merely the lesser of several evils. Still when its staying calm horror fans looking for integrity inside their scares wont be disappointed. And now Bell can break out of the genre. Shes served her time.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Still of Ashley Bell in The Last Exorcism Part II. (CBS Films/CBS FILMS) By Sean OConnell March 1 2013 At what point do you think the producers of 2010s surprise hit ""The Last Exorcism"" regretted putting the word ""Last"" in their title? Was it after the first wave of positive reviews rolled in? Could it have been right around the time the low-budget indie horror film turned a sizable profit earning 67 million in global ticket sales and all but guaranteeing a sequel? Not to worry. True horror fans know that ""Last"" -- and similar adjectives -- hold no weight in this sequel-happy genre. Thats why there were six additional Jason movies after 1984s ""Friday the 13th The Final Chapter"" and Freddy Krueger didnt actually die in the 1991 thriller ""Freddys Dead The Final Nightmare."" So long as audiences support horror franchises at the box office studios happily will crank out substandard follow-up films that have no real interest beyond squeezing dollars from a marketable brand. The promise of a quick cash grab is the only excuse that justifies ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" an ineffective excursion that maintains a few direct ties back to the original film but never moves the story forward. Dark components that genuinely disturbed us in the first film -- a skeptical Southern preacher (played by Patrick Fabian) getting his faith shaken to the core; the hand-held camera techniques of a true-crime docu-drama; a legitimate fear of the occult -- are sacrificed for generic scares and flavorless plot twists. By jogging in place for an hour and a half this monotonous and unimaginative sequel only tests a viewers patience and should ensure that this actually is the last chapter in the rapidly declining series. For continuitys sake ""Part II"" picks up in the Louisiana swamp where Nell (Ashley Bell) has given birth to the demonic love child of a seedy pastor. Fabians character has been killed (the actor is sorely missed in this humorless sequel) and the shell-shocked Nell hardly remembers anything we witnessed in the first movie. Since she essentially has been orphaned by the events of the first film Nell is turned over to a New Orleans foster home for wayward women where her possession continues and strange occurrences start plaguing the homes emotionally damaged residents. And by ""strange"" I mean ""boring."" Nell admits to a sympathetic counselor (Muse Watson) that she still feels the evil presence of the demon Abalam but all the unseen threat does is make dirty phone calls in the dead of night and occasionally send black flies to buzz around Nells bedroom. Abalams more annoying than terrifying in this sequel following Nell around the French Quarter while wearing a Mardi Gras mask and prompting dogs to bark in a cheap effort to get audience members to jump in their chairs. Bell was a welcome find in the original ""Last Exorcism"" and she continues to try interesting things with her unusual character. The actress projects a farm-girl innocence when playing Nell turning the naive heroine into a blank slate thats ripe for satanic corruption. And ""Part II"" like so many horror sequels concerns itself with Nells sexual awakening which encourages the flexible Bell to writhe and squirm like a serpent on a Twister board. But the PG-13 rating pushes all racy gory material far off screen instantly deflating any potential heat or tension the sequel threatened to generate. Without spoiling anything I will say that ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" ends on an open note that teases a legitimately engaging setup for a potential third movie. But really the producers of this series should quit while theyre behind. One sequel was unnecessary. A second sequel would be criminal. Besides what could they possibly call it? ""The Last Exorcism Seriously. We Mean It This Time. Trust Us?"" The Last Exorcism Part II r PG-13. At area theaters.

Having eschewed the found-footage format of the original director Ed Gass-Donnelly makes good-ish use of the movies New Orleans location. Ashley Bell is convincingly fretful as the returning exorcisee Nell who spends much of the film enduring flies visions of her dead father and nocturnal backbending (a limber vertebrae has now officially replaced projectile vomiting as the definitive proof of demonic possession). Unfortunately no one involved seems to have bent over backwards to make the movie either original or even all that scary.

Share Tweet Lost in all the jokes about the very existence of a sequel to 2010s The Last Exorcism--""The Lastest Exorcism?"" etc.--is a much more simple reason it isnt necessary Everything that was good about the first movie is dead. The problem with most found-footage horror movies is the mundane lulls before and between the punctuating spasms of supernatural activity but The Last Exorcism reversed the formula surrounding a run-of-the-mill demon-possession tale with a funny ironic character study about a sham exorcist who unwittingly stumbles into the real thing. Once the back-arching and mythological hoo-hah began in earnest the film slid into an ending that made audiences groan and that low point is where the story picks up with The Last Exorcism Part II an abysmal sequel that abandons the found-footage concept along with the pockets of wit and originality that made its predecessor salvageable. The only real carry-over here for reasons of mortality is Ashley Bell the Louisiana country girl whose corporeal form was invaded by a beastie named Abalam. In the dumbest of the films three dozen fake scares she turns up disheveled and confused in a private residence and the authorities place her in a foster home in New Orleans among other abused and abandoned teenage girls. With the support of her new friends and a job on a motel cleaning crew Bell inches her way back to normalcy in spite of escalating signs that Abalam is looking for a host again. She even strikes up a relationship with a shy co-worker (Spencer Treat Clark) that awakens her slumbering libido which only makes her more receptive to the forces of evil. The Last Exorcism Part II summons all the cliched New Orleans atmosphere it can muster voodoo cults Mardi Gras floats old-timey radios that only play crackling blues music from the 20s and 30s. But these are spices in the familiar gumbo of levitations guttural voices and ineffectual incantations thats been ladled out in the 40 years since William Friedkins The Exorcist. Theres a Carrie-like element to this sheltered religious girl from the sticks trying to be a normal teenager but Bells uncertainty in the lead reflects more on her limitations than her characters. She had the right look for the Plain Jane victim in the first movie; here shes the victim of its success.

Totally wasnt the last one. 8 Shares Share 4 Tweet 4 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo PATTI PERRET The jump scare can be a problematic tool. It works on a purely physical level Our fight-or-flight response to things suddenly jumping out in our faces is biological imperative not filmmaking artistry. But some movies employ it wisely building up to their big ""boo"" moments in ways that dont seem cheap or opportunistic. (Think of Mama earlier this year.) But most horror films nowadays rely on jump scares because they dont have much else to go with. The Last Exorcism Part II fits in a third category For much of its running time its a surprisingly effective almost classically restrained thriller that builds its tension slowly methodically. But then it pees in its own soup by larding itself up with jump scares galore almost destroying the uneasy chilling mood its created. Those who saw the first film might be surprised to hear this one described as ""classical"" since the original was another of those disposable found-footage horror flicks albeit with some genuinely scary moments. Part II picks up soon after the events of the first film and features the same central possessed character Nell (Ashley Bell) a young woman who when we first see her is terrorizing a married couple in their home like some kind of demon. Taken to a kind of recovery home for troubled female souls Nell starts a new life under the kindly but disbelieving eye of social worker Frank Merle (Muse Watson). Sure enough the demon that possessed her Abalam isnt far away and things start to go off-kilter fairly quickly. Unlike many of the other directors working in the genre today director Ed Gass-Donnelly uses out-of-focus background elements long takes and deliberate pacing to create a world where everything seems slightly unhinged where anything seems possible -- more David Lynch than Eli Roth (though Roth is one of the executive producers of this film). Bell who was also in the first film has a similarly uncomfortable quality that serves her nicely. She seems uneasy in her own skin an innocent to whom everything seems new and either wondrous or threatening. Its a smart elemental performance We can see doubt and relief and anger and fear work their way across her face almost like a childs. At times you feel like this could be a silent film. (And with harebrained dialogue like ""I dont believe in ghosts but I do believe in people"" you often wish it were.) Anyway thats the good news. The bad news is that this matter-of-fact brick-by-brick approach to building scares and tension probably wont work for audiences who just want to scream a lot so Gass-Donnelly undercuts it all by haphazardly tossing in jump scares of the cheapest most predictable kind which force their own crippling rhythm to the movie. Instead of experiencing the slow build of tension watching this girls reality unravel around her we wind up being carried along from cheap thrill to cheap thrill. And theyre not even particularly good thrills. If you watch closely enough youll see that somewhere inside The Last Exorcism Part II is a very good thriller -- a genuinely unnerving movie about possession -- struggling to get out. But then the sound drops out the music shrieks a figure jumps out and were back to the same old same old.

In ""The Last Exorcism"" (2010) this Louisiana teenager was possessed by the demon Abalam and ultimately bore his progeny only to have their unholy offspring disposed of by solemn hooded attendants. In ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" she has survived that ordeal unlike her father (or so it appears) the documentary crew filming her and the minister of lapsed faith who attempted to coax out her tormentor.Now shes in a house for recovering trauma patients in New Orleans and Abalam has again come a-courting. But only indirectly making overtures through greasepainted human statues (the kind in Times Square) birds hitting windows voices hidden in radio static and the ubiquitous presence of insects. (Clearly ""The Last Exorcism"" was a misnomer.)Nells roommate Gwen (the very interesting though very underused Julia Garner star of the coming ""Electrick Children"" a hit at South by Southwest) isnt much help with Nells suitor. But a hardy group of demon-relocation specialists (including E. Roger Mitchell) gives it a shot.""The Last Exorcism Part II"" belongs to a flourishing genre you could call terror tease. Devoid of nudity gore and obscene dialogue PG-13 films like the ""Paranormal Activity"" series and the first ""Last Exorcism"" eschew graphic violence for mood and minor scares -- perfect for Friday-night mall outings without Mom and Dad. If only they gave you more to think about.At least this movie like its predecessor has Ashley Bell as Nell. An actress who suggests religious piety carnal fire and satanic aggression with equal dexterity Ms. Bell provides a pulse an audience can connect with amid the standard-issue atmospheric accouterments.""The Last Exorcism Part II"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for mild violence and brief strong language.

TWITTER This sequel to the breakout horror-film hit finds its young heroine once again undergoing the titular ritual. Instantly rendering the title of its first installment moot The Last Exorcism Part II proves yet again that you cant keep a good demon down. Yes Abalam is back to torture Nell Sweetzer (Ashley Bell) the innocent deeply religious young woman who went through both spiritual and physical contortions in the 2010 breakout hit. After a brief recap featuring scenes from the original film Nell -- who somehow survived its fiery climax -- is seen terrorizing a young couple in their home after which she is promptly whisked off to a New Orleans halfway house for troubled girls. There shes introduced to such joys as hard-rock music on an iPod the exotic spectacle of Mardi Gras and a burgeoning attraction to a nice young man who returns her interest. PHOTOS Iconic Horror Movies But it isnt long before creepy things begin happening including ominous visits from her fathers ghost warning her that shes in danger; her newfound friends suddenly being possessed by a vengeful spirit; and an unsettling encounter with a stranger in a church thats followed by an attack by suicidal birds. (That last scene incidentally represents the second such episode in a horror film in a week following quickly on the heels of Dark Skies.) Forgoing the faux found-footage technique that the original employed this sequel takes a more classical narrative approach. Unfortunately while director/co-writer Ed Gass-Donnelly displays an admirable restraint in his general eschewing of gratuitous gore quick editing and flashy visuals the results have a generally soporific feel. Although there are several moments that are undeniably creepy such as Nells encounter with a motionless mime or her experiencing an episode of airborne solo sexual ecstasy the general tedium is only alleviated by the obligatory shock scares for which the sound mixer has dutifully cranked up the volume to 11. PHOTOS Halloween Gone Wrong The 10 Least Scary Movies of All Time It all culminates in -- what else? -- another exorcism this time of the voodoo variety. But the scene barely registers and the explosive finale featuring unimpressive CGI fire effects is a further letdown. Reprising her role Bell again is the films chief asset delivering a memorable unsettling performance that easily can be compared to Sissy Spaceks Carrie. Vividly conveying her characters complex emotions with a minimum of histrionics she actually comes across as a real person unlike so many glam horror film heroines who look like theyve just stepped out of a photo shoot. Although the actress doesnt perform nearly as many of the memorable physical contortions as she did in the first film she remains a vital presence throughout and clearly is headed for bigger and better things. Of course before that she might be headed to a third installment of this series the seeds of which are planted in an open-ended climax demonstrating that this edition should have probably been titled The Penultimate Exorcism.

Nell (Ashley Bell) isnt quick to respond. She doesnt quite remember what happened out at the Sweetzer farm -- how she birthed a demon baby before a mass of worshippers how said worshippers then killed a camera crew that had been documenting her prolonged possession by the frisky likes of the evil spirit Abalam -- so to watch the ill-titled ""The Last Exorcism Part 2"" is to already know what Nell doesnt It aint over. The film picks up from the moment that the cameras (and bodies) fell with director Ed Gass-Donnelly opting for a crisp static widescreen approach to the supernatural shenanigans this time around as if to apologize for the jittery found-footage tactics of the first outing. Nell is found in a feral state by some unnerved neighbors and it isnt long before shes shipped off to a girls home overseen by kindly counselor Frank (Muse Watson spewing unprompted maxims at such a fast clip that it seems as if hes auditioning for Scott Glenns role in ""Sucker Punch""). Nell settles in loosens up finds a job and meets a boy (Spencer Treat Clark) in due time but of course it isnt long until Nells past comes back to haunt her in the form of hallucinations nightmares flashbacks masked followers shadowy figures and improbable fame as a viral video sensation (what her legion of cult admirers would stand to gain by uploading that footage to YouTube and inviting inquiries into what really happened before I havent the foggiest). Its girl-who-cried-wolf routine for her and a non-mystery for us the potentially apocalyptic stakes of which are more often said than shown and if you told me that Gass-Donnelly and co-writer Damien Chazelle had worked together to retrofit an already generic possession screenplay for the sake of this franchise Id believe it. Fortunately Gass-Donnellys prowess as a helmer is frequently on display eager as he is to isolate the characters within the frame and prone to lingering on quiet asides -- like flies on a bathroom mirror or bicycles abandoned in the street -- effectively transforming the mundane details of Nells new life into more ominous indicators of decay and foreboding. Alas we also get the suddenly loud dog the cymbal crash any time someone startles our lead and just about every other jolt tactic that deflates the films carefully creepy approach. Late-night seizures becomes exceedingly bone-crunching affairs while a neutered throat-slitting begs to be restored on the inevitable unrated DVD. To her credit all the hokum does little to change the fact that Bell maintains her fragile performance from the first film. The actress is fueled equally by naivete and trauma able to elicit compassion for her character beyond her tendency for bodily contortions (exploited far less here than expected). ""Part 2"" rushes into its climactic re-exorcism with characters hardly established earlier than the third act paying off few sinister intimations of those characters who had come before and the ending falls in line with the now-belabored ""Paranormal Activity"" formula of wheel-spinning and sequel-teasing. At the end of the day its a sure-handed sequel but not a terribly thrilling one.
