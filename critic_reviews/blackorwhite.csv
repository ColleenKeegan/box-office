On its surface Mike Binders film about a widowed white grandfather fighting to maintain custody of his biracial grandchild from her paternal black grandmother has all the hallmarks of a white savior melodrama. Told from the point of view of wealthy Santa Monica attorney Elliot (Kevin Costner) who has recently lost his beloved wife to a car accident the film details his struggles to raise 7-year-old Eloise (a charming Jillian Estell) while dealing with a bitter legal battle that ensues after Rowena (Octavia Spencer) mother to the childs estranged father decides that Eloise needs to have a better sense of her black identity. The film places us firmly within Elliots world It opens with him in the hospital and its grounded in his grief right from the get-go. He and his late wife (played by the great Jennifer Ehle largely wasted as a silent ghostlike apparition in dreams flashbacks and hallucinations) had been raising Eloise on their own for some years and now Elliot isnt sure what to do. When Rowena who lives in Compton with what appears to be her entire extended family crowded into a single home asks for shared custody of Eloise her demands seem to him like an added nuisance at a time when he least needs it. Elliot doesnt want to have anything to do with Rowena; her son Eloises father is a crack addict and Elliot holds him partially responsible for his daughters death during childbirth seven years ago. When he visits Rowenas home Elliot looks on with thinly veiled disgust at the people crowded into rooms watching television at the hip-hop blasting from the drug house next door even at the successful clothing retail business Rowena runs out of her garage. The film seems to share Elliots contempt at first but Binder wants to complicate that point of view. Eloises father may be a crack addict but Elliot is an alcoholic the kind of guy who loads his coffee mug with whiskey before taking the young girl to school; its just that his addiction is a socially sanctioned one and he can feel free to have an elegant massive bar sitting in the center of his living room. Elliots house might be big and comfortable and Rowenas smallish and crowded but theres also a sense of community in hers thats sorely lacking in the chilly halls of his McMansion; at one point we witness what appears to be an impromptu family-wide jazz performance. Similarly when Rowenas Ivy League-educated lawyer brother (Anthony Mackie) comes into the picture with what appears to be a phalanx of cut-throat attorneys the film takes care to show Elliot conferring with his own smugly offensive legal team. ""He has got a problem with black people"" Mackies character says. ""If he didnt we wouldnt be here would we?"" Not long after one of Elliots lawyer chums asks him ""Are you okay getting ugly?"" Each side it seems is ready to take things nuclear; by contrast Elliot and Rowena seem uncertain about pushing matters to such extremes. Black or White wants to say Big Important Things about how society and our preconceptions force us into those extremes. It also wants to draw attention to the double standard with which we view certain problems such as addiction. But it takes either a very deft or a very bold filmmaker to tackle these challenges compellingly onscreen and Binder appears to be neither. The parallelisms he presents here are so schematic that theres no chance for anything resembling real life to intrude. Costner whos been quite good in a number of films during this late career resurgence often looks lost playing a character whose traits seem more like symbols than anything else. But the film narratively privileges his point of view so hes the only character who has even a remote chance of coming to life. Spencer brings some energy to Rowena with the pointed almost Jimmy Cagney-like speed of her delivery but she hasnt been given a lot to deal with. By contrast the always-excellent Mackie brings just the right amount of heartless drive to the character of the lawyer brother; its enough to make you briefly forget that hes playing what could easily be interpreted as a racist caricature the ""uppity"" black attorney. As if to temper that portrayal Binder also has Elliot hire a math tutor (Mpho Koaho) for himself and Eloise; the man turns out to be a hypereducated savantlike West African whose family was massacred in a village pogrom and he seemingly knows everything about math science and literature handing out specialized whitepapers the way others hand out business cards. Its meant to be a positive portrayal but oddly enough it highlights one of the key problems of this strange self-important movie. Everybody in Black or White represents something. Its a film that wants to put forth a humanist message but has no recognizable humanity of its own.

And writer-director Michael Binders drama about a custody dust-up between the grandparents of a biracial child arrives at an especially prickly moment movie-wise. For those who shrugged off seven of this years best-picture Oscar nominees as merely being films about ""white mens struggles"" this drama is likely to be used as further evidence of that Hollywood (and beyond) habit. Theres little way around the fact Kevin Costner is the centerpiece in this sincere and engaging drama although Octavia Spencers performance as paternal grandmother Rowena Jeffers -- a self-made businesswoman and matriarch of an extended and varied brood -- exerts its own force. When Elliott Andersons wife dies unexpectedly granddaughter Eloises care falls to him. While Elliott loves his only grandchild its clear her day-to-day nurturing was his wifes gift. Aware of the vacuum created by the death Rowena almost immediately begins efforts to share more formally in Eloises upbringing. (Shes also well aware of Elliotts drinking problem.) To her mind the little girl should come live with her and Eloises cousins aunts and uncles in South Central. What begins as a suggestion becomes litigation. Anthony Mackie plays Jeremiah Rowenas brother and a very successful attorney who takes on his sisters suit as a test case. While Elliott and Rowena live in very different versions of Los Angeles they have much in common. Elliotts haunted by his dead wife Carol played by Jennifer Ehle. (Their daughter died years earlier.) Rowena is being haunted by a living being son Reggie. Andre Holland portrays Eloises father an addict with all the seduction and disappointment that encompasses. (Elliotts alcoholism provides a parallel quandary.) ""Black or White"" is buoyed by a beguiling performance from newcomer Jillian Estel. Eloise is bright and frank loyal but yearning present but torn. Shes a lovely spirit and like Rowena and Elliott moviegoers want the best for her. More problematic Like those battling grandparents we too may find it difficult to shake our own cultural investment in what that might be. Such is the gentle power of Binders film. Based on Binders experience ""Black or White"" isnt sophisticated about race. Theres nothing here that suggests the writer-director pored over 30 years of critical race theory. Instead the drama falls in line with his previous films ""The Upside of Anger"" and ""Reign Over Me."" One dealt with a husbands seeming desertion the other with the loss of a family in the attacks of 9/11 -- heavy subjects treated with Binders talent for locating humor amidst pathos. Here thoughtful humor comes by way of family court judge (a very deadpan Paula Newsome); and more poignantly Duvan (Mpho Koaho) the tutor Elliott hires. As aspirational African immigrant provides an outsider view of Americas black-white tussle. It may be helpful -- or vexing -- to think of ""Black or White"" as the great grandchild of ""Guess Whos Coming to Dinner?"" No it wont be as enduring -- not even close. Yet it shares that message movies desire to acknowledge change and also speak the personal aches and shared possibilities that come with it. That it comes by this honestly makes it a sympathetic more than simply sentimental journey.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The first sign of trouble is the music a maudlin tinkle that never lets up brass and keys filling every available pocket of sonic space. Its the work of Terence Blanchard the famous jazz trumpeter and film composer best known in cinema circles for his collaborations with Spike Lee. Blanchards scores can be vibrant and beautiful but they can also be oppressive drowning out small moments with a big racket. In Mike Binders Black Or White every moment is big even the small ones and Blanchard seems to have been brought in to assure that only the severely hard of hearing will miss how damn emotional this all is. Maybe on the other hand his involvement is meant to create some power by association A race drama fashioned out of a family feud Black Or White at least sounds like a Spike Lee joint though it rarely plays like one.Binder who once made lowbrow comedies but now specializes in middlebrow dramedies is in several leagues over his head with this story of a custody battle between a white grandfather and a black grandmother. Reunited with the writer and director of his midlife-crisis vehicle The Upside Of Anger Kevin Costner brings a certain charming saltiness to the role of Elliot a high-functioning drunk whose cushy suburban life is turned upside down by the death of his wife (Jennifer Ehle way too good of an actress to be relegated to wordless flashbacks). Elliots daughter died years ago while giving birth to the adorable Eloise (Jillian Estell) and while hes provided his granddaughter a loving charmed upbringing hes also limited her interactions with the other side of the family--and now Grandma Rowena (a typically strong Octavia Spencer) wants a shot at custody. Is Elliot the racist she thinks he is or is he just trying to protect Eloise from her biological father Reggie (Andre Holland) a supposedly recovering crack addict whom Elliot blames for the death of his daughter?Per its title Black Or White feigns dramatic balance but its perspective is obviously aligned with only one of these warring relatives While Elliots upper-middle-class world feels specific the other characters reside in a stereotypically sketched South Central--a place where jobless adults spend all day shooting the shit on the porch while Rowena operates six businesses out of her garage. Binder thinks hes playing fair by drawing parallels between Reggies weakness for the pipe and Elliots drinking problem but the latter is often played for laughs while the former is treated like a source of suspense the factor that will determine whether Elliot is a bigoted jackass or just smart to distrust Reggie. Its telling that the voice of reason on the other side Rowenas brother and lawyer (played by Anthony Mackie) seems equally distrustful of his nephew.When not piling on the shrill melodrama like a violent showdown that could have been pulled straight out of Crash Binder is leaning hard on lame comic relief Theres a nerdy African tutor (Mpho Koaho) who loves to write essays on every conceivable subject and the inevitable courtroom finale stalls for some sassy fireworks between Rowena and the judge. Everything builds inexorably to a mission-statement monologue a big speech on race that feels like the impetus of the entire project. Guess who delivers it. Black Or White is never less than sincere in its tackling of a tough topic but not everyone is equipped to wade into those waters. Tempting though it might be to celebrate any earnest good-faith attempt to talk about race in America its clear that the creator of Mind Of The Married Man was not the right one to do the talking.

This leaves him in charge of their 9-year-old granddaughter Eloise (Jillian Estell) whose mother -- Elliots daughter -- died in childbirth.Elliot has a drinking problem thats pushed forward by the death of his wife. Still hes up for raising Eloise on his own. Then a problem interferes Eloises other grandmother Rowena (Octavia Spencer) who believes the girl needs to be raised in a black community. Complicating Rowenas argument is the fact that her son Duvan (Mpho Koaho) -- the father Eloise barely remembers -- has a long history of drug abuse and criminal activity.Rowena enlists her high-powered attorney brother Jeremiah (Anthony Mackie) to take the case to court. And Jeremiah wants to make it all about race.Understand Elliot and Rowena actually like one another -- at one point Rowena brings her entire extended family over to Elliots for an impromptu pool party. They just each sincerely think they know whats best for Eloise. So off to court they go.And thats where the problems pile up. Duvan -- whos still doing drugs -- volunteers to take a drug test. So why doesnt anybody test him? Why doesnt anybody screen the respective homes? Elliots is a pristine suburban estate. Rowenas place is pristine as well -- except the guys on the porch next door are smoking crack. Thats something most family court judges would want to know.At one point Duvan comes to Elliots house and takes Eloise away illegally -- but Elliot never files charges. And when Elliot is on the witness stand being badgered as a racist why doesnt he point out that he had 20 black people over to his house for a pool party?Theres a lot more but most crucially no one in authority ever asks Eloise where she wants to live. What?Obviously race is a messy divisive issue for many and any opportunity to examine or discuss the frictions involved should be applauded. But logic just cant be abandoned in the haste for that discussion.

A man fights for custody of his granddaughter -- and himself. Director Mike Binder (202). PG-13 Language drinking violence. Area theaters. Sometimes flawed material can be saved by great performances and good intentions. Thats the case with ""Black or White"" a racial melodrama that until it stumbles into obvious and maudlin territory is a thoughtful work thanks to Octavia Spencer Anthony Mackie and especially Kevin Costner. Costner plays Elliott a middle-aged attorney whose life has seen a lot of heartbreak. His 17-year-old daughter died in childbirth nine years ago and Elliott and his wife raised their granddaughter Eloise (adorable Jillian Estell) as their own. But as the film opens Elliotts wife has just died. Hes not doing well -- mostly because hes so distraught that hes drinking more than usual. But he and Eloise make a sweet team -- even their names sound alike -- and they fall into a routine He makes lunches picks her up from school and hires a tutor to teach them both fourth-grade math. What they dont talk about is that Eloises father is black -- because it doesnt matter to Elliott and Eloise hasnt seen her father in three years. But race matters to Rowena (Spencer) Eloises paternal grandmother. Always welcome in Elliotts home the outspoken Rowena thinks the death of Elliotts wife means that she should take over raising Eloise. Plus Eloises dad -- her son -- has reemerged after drug problems. Her relationship with Elliott is congenial if a bit strained -- and the grandparents differences including issues of race force Rowena to sue for custody of Eloise. The resulting legal battle is hackneyed with Rowena repeatedly told by an African-American female judge to stop disturbing the court. A racist comment made by Elliott is weighed for possible prejudice. A stabilizing force here is Mackies sharp portrayal of Rowenas lawyer who can see how ill-thought-out if sincere her case is. The movie tilts things away from Rowena. Thats a structural problem -- we should root for both her and Elliott -- but still theres a good deal of measured nuance in ""Black or White."" Director Mike Binder is a standup comic-turned-director whose films (""Reign Over Me"" ""The Upside of Anger"") arent afraid of uncomfortable emotions. Neither is this movie. But it is put together in such a way that white audiences who want to be reassured of inherent goodwill will leave satisfied. On the plus side Elliott is not a 21st-century Archie Bunker who happens to have a mixed-race granddaughter he adores. And its great to reexperience the easygoing charisma and average-guy-ness that made Costner a star almost 30 years ago. Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer star in Black or White. (Tracy Bennett) This is the kind of comeback performance Costner needed and it will help erase the stain of last years dreadful ""Three Days to Kill."" As Elliott hes paunchy and often drunk but when he confronts the father of the little girl he loves his indignation seems to be fueled by the right reasons. When hes affectionately reading a story to young Eloise or shrugging off easy statements with a disbelieving wince and wave of his hand hes a leading man doing his best even in a slippery story that meets him halfway. As good as Costner is whats also satisfying is watching Spencer do so much with what could have been merely a stereotype and seeing Mackie (""The Hurt Locker"" ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"") take another step in a strong career.

"Black or White | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; black-or-white ) Black or White (United States 2014) January 29 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli There could be no more timely subject matter for a movie in early 2015 than race relations in America. Black or White a sporadically insightful movie from Mike Binder approaches some of these issues head-on without flinching or resorting to hysteria. For the most part it offers a balanced illustration of how stereotyping and subtle forms of racism can inform everyday actions and decisions. The film is by no means perfect and its goals are undermined by a sloppy climax and conclusion but it avoids preaching while providing fodder for thought. This is the latest starring vehicle for Kevin Costner who has returned to the limelight with a vengeance in the last few years after nearly two low-profile decades. Some of Costners recent projects have obviously been financially motivated but thats not the case with Black or White for which he receives a producer credit to go along with a starring role. In a previous review I noted that Costners acting has improved markedly with age. In his heyday - the years when he made the likes of The Untouchables and Robin Hood - his popularity was more about his looks than his ability. In Black or White he displays more range than he ever did in the 80s and 90s. Its a difficult part because he has to make his character sympathetic while at the same time not hiding his demons alcoholism and traces of ingrained racism that even he is unaware of. He is paired with fellow Oscar winner Octavia Spencer who like Costner is tasked with crafting a character who faces her own challenges about skin color. Costner and Spencer play Elliot Anderson and Rowena Jeffers the grandparents of a bi-racial 7-year old girl Eloise Anderson (Jillian Estell). Eloises family history is laced with tragedy. Her mother Elliots daughter died at birth. Her father Reggie Davis (Andre Holland) is a drug addict whose habit has dominated his recent years. She has been raised by Elliot and his wife Carol (Jennifer Ehle) but when Carol is killed in a car accident Rowena wonders whether a shared custody situation might represent an equitable approach going-forward. The struggle that develops isnt bitter -Elliot and Rowena despite being oil and water remain on speaking terms - but it highlights the differences in what the two potential caregivers believe to be best for their granddaughter. Both have their blind spots and weaknesses. Its too bad that Binder goes for a feel-good ending because this poisons Black or Whites final fifteen minutes with a forced artificial feel that isnt helped by an ill-fitting dollop of magical realism. Individuals who are consistent over nearly 100 minutes of screen time suddenly act out of character. Binders direction evidences heavy-handed moments - he relies overmuch on Terence Blanchards heartstring-tugging score and he has a penchant for sentimentality (a problem in his previous outing 2007s Reign Over Me). There are also some ill-advised attempts at comedy (Eloises self-pimping tutor the ditzy girlfriend of Elliots lawyer) that come across as more awkward than amusing. Black or White deserves credit for framing racism in less overt terms than we are used to seeing in motion pictures and more in-line with what ""average"" people encounter in real life. Movies in general gravitate toward hyperbole; Binder resists this. Elliot sees himself as color-blind; hes not aware that at least some element of his resistance to Rowena is based on stereotypes. Likewise Rowena views Elliot through lenses tinted by her own prejudices. Theres a telling scene in which Elliot enters Rowenas house and watches the free and easy way in which his granddaughter interacts with her cousins aunt and other members of the family. Although young Jillian Estell gives an effervescent performance she is underserved by a script that sees Eloise as a plot device. The girl has no real character - shes less a person than a catalyst. When she paints a picture its for us to see how Elliot and Rowena react to it. Her scenes with Reggie and Elliot are all about the adults. Eloise is supposed to be seven but she talks and acts like a much older girl and its odd that her grief about her grandmothers death lasts for only a couple of scenes (while Elliots is an ongoing companion). For a movie that wants us to believe that everyone involved seeks whats best for Eloise (rather than employing her as a pawn in a larger struggle) its odd that the screenplay fails to make her more real. For much of its running length Black or White is an uncommonly brave film but it loses its gumption at the end. The good but flawed effort is at least partially undone by the way in which Binder chooses to conclude matters.

With Reggies mom Rowena (the reliably superb Octavia Spencer) ready to back him up in a custody battle the stage is set for family warfare. And no one is shy about playing the race card. Writer-director Mike Binder who worked beautifully with Costner on 2005s The Upside of Anger finds himself on the downside of juggling stereotypes. The contrast between Elliots whitey affluence and the lively chaos of Rowenas black household is drawn in laughably broad strokes. Yet you can feel Binders commitment to the volatile material best realized in a courtroom scene in which Elliot takes the stand to make a distinction between racism and race awareness.

When her paternal grandmother (Octavia Spencer) seeks custody with the help of her brother (Anthony Mackie) the little girl is torn between two families who love her deeply. (Relativity Media) By Stephanie Merry January 29 2015 Follow stephmerry Eloise is one amazing 7-year-old. The adorable little girl at the center of ""Black or White"" cooks her own pancakes while delegating the table-setting; coaches her grandfather on how to be a stern authority figure; and when he turns to alcohol after the loss of his wife shakes her head and says ""I hate it when you drink."" Aside from a brief moment when shes flopped in front of the television and an iPad the kid is like some kind of unicorn. And her character pretty well sums up ""Black or White."" The movie paints a sweet memorable picture but also an overly convenient one. Eloise (impressively played by cute-as-a-button Jillian Estell) has been under the guardianship of her grandparents a white well-to-do Los Angeles couple with a pool and a maid and the means to send Eloise to the best prep school in town. The pairs daughter Eloises mother died in childbirth. And while the father who is black and a drug addict has never been in the picture his family has. The custody arrangement seems to be working out at least until Eloises grandmother dies suddenly and her widower Elliot (Kevin Costner) becomes a single (grand)father. He doesnt know how to brush Eloises hair and gets lost taking her to school. He also drinks whiskey for breakfast. So the girls paternal grandmother Rowena (Octavia Spencer) thinks it might be time for Eloise to move in with her in a bustling house with lots of family in South Central L.A. Before you know it Rowena has enlisted her brother a high-powered lawyer (Anthony Mackie) to help her get full custody and things get ugly fast with finger-pointing dirt-digging and accusations of racism. The script penned by director Mike Binder smartly doles out details slowly. The circumstances of Eloises birth and her fathers subsequent behavior arent fully revealed until the movie is almost over leaving a bit of mystery. But the writing is also overwrought. The performances are fantastic across the board with Costner acting in his trademark low-key naturalistic style and Spencer as the picture of no-nonsense maternal love. But their efforts cant make up for overly simplified characters not to mention melodramatic exchanges that sound exactly like written dialogue. This is especially apparent during courtroom scenes -- when filmmakers just love to amp up the drama -- and though the moments dont reach ""you cant handle the truth""-caliber histrionics they still test credulity. (Apparently opposing counsel wont object to prejudicial testimony as long as its delivered as a triumphant monologue.) ""Black or White"" is in some ways more of an exercise than a story. It poses questions worth asking Can a white man raise and love his granddaughter but still have racial biases? Shouldnt a biracial girl be exposed to the full spectrum of her cultural identity? The title suggests there are no easy answers. So why does everything feel so tidy?   PG-13. At area theaters. Contains brief strong language drug use drinking and a fight. 121 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

More than that actually. 2) The movie doesnt make a lot of sense. The film concerns Elliot a widower (Kevin Costner) who has to fight to maintain custody of his granddaughter Eloise (Jillian Estell) after the childs drug-addict father turns up to claim her. Eloise who is seven years old has been raised by her grandparents since birth -- her teenaged mother died soon after she was born and her father was out of the picture. Eloise says at least three times in the course of the story that she wants to stay with her grandfather. Elliot is white obviously. Eloise and her father are black. After Elliots wife dies Eloises other grandmother -- played by Octavia Spencer -- feels that the little girl would be better off with the African-American side of the family. She gets a  successful lawyer in the family (Anthony Mackie) to pursue custody. The legal tussle over Eloise begins but it never adds up. Eloises biological father Reggie (Andre Holland) is a drug user and a no-hoper who keeps offering to give up the fight for Eloise in exchange for enough money. Octavia Spencer has the thankless task of portraying Grandma Rowena --  a role that requires she play a formidable matriarch one minute and then in the courtroom scenes a sort of buffoon. Its an unfair fight and no judge in his or her right mind would ever take Eloise away from her grandfather all those middle-class  cousins in South-Central notwithstanding. The movie careers between comedy and drama in a disconcerting fashion. Black Or White is apparently based on the experience writer/director Mike Binder (The Upside of Anger) had helping raise his biracial nephew. If we had to guess wed say Binder was hoping to look at race relations in America without the veneer of political correctness but again thats just a guess. On the race front Black or White turns out to be more about red -- as in herring. What is certain is that Black Or White involves some fuzzy storytelling starting with the death of Elliots wife at the top of the movie and moving right along to the happy-face ending. Also the music is obvious and overbearing. On the positive side Costners performance really is powerful. What it all means remains a mystery. Black Or White opens in Toronto Vancouver and Montreal on Jan. 30. It expands to other Canadian cities throughout the winter.

Her black family and her white family joust for custody of Eloise (Jillian Estell left) with Kevin Costner as her grandpa. Photo Tracy Bennett / Associated Press Movie review Black or White Weighty or trivial? 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The little girl is adorable and two sides of the family are fighting over her in ""Black or White."" On one side theres the newly widowed maternal grandfather (Kevin Costner) who raised the girl all her life. On the other theres the paternal grandmother (Octavia Spencer) who wants the girl to grow up around her and her extended family. One of these days it may be possible to make a movie about a dispute between white characters and black characters thats just about people in dispute. It might even be possible right now and someone ought to try it. But ""Black or White"" even by its title invites audiences to see it as a film about race. This puts too much pressure on the story and limits where it can go. To put it simply people may be right and people may be wrong but there are no right races or wrong races. A writer-director who chooses to have characters representing race and not themselves alone paints himself into a corner in which everyone in the movie absolutely must come out all right. Still working within these self-imposed limits writer-director Mike Binder does some interesting things and casts the movie well. For the child Eloise he finds a little movie star in Jillian Estell who is warm and already a good actress and precocious without being bratty. Costner by his very nature has an aura of decency and integrity; and while Binder doesnt have Costner play against that he gives him some rough edges. Elliot has a hard-to-control temper not with Eloise but with everyone else and he is developing a drinking problem. Actually he has two drinking problems Hes drinking heavily and hes drinking the wrong Scotch. Costners portrayal of drunkenness is technically brilliant right up with the very best. Costner remembers what others often forget that when people are drunk theyre usually doing their best to conceal it. When theyre exposed its almost always through cracks in the facade rarely by a wholesale crumbling. Costner also conveys varying degrees of drunkenness for different scenes with such clarity that I cant begin to figure how he did it. In the role of Rowena Elliots opponent in the custody fight Octavia Spencer pushes at the constraints of her usual likable persona. Shes a self-made woman the matriarch and support of two households but shes a difficult personality driven by impulses shes not entirely aware of. Rowena tells Elliot that she believes that Eloise needs to be around ""her people"" but as played by Spencer and hinted at in Binders script her deeper motive might be to rescue her drug-addicted son. ""Black or White"" is such a mix of smart and tin-eared choices that you can love or hate the movie depending on what you choose to notice. It has for example songs on the soundtrack that are glaring in their inappropriateness. At one point Costner is driving down the road in a contemplative mood and the soundtrack is playing Billy Joels ""Dont Ask Me Why."" (Why? Dont ask.) In another scene Binder chooses a moment of introspection to resurrect the 1976 hit ""Misty Blue."" Speaking of unwelcome resurrections Jennifer Ehle keeps showing up in visions as the deceased wife smiling in that peaceful loving so-happy-to-be-dead way that we all know from bad movies. On the other hand its hard not to like a picture that casts comedian Bill Burr as Costners law partner lets him act in dramatic scenes and yet every so often throws him a funny line. Paula Newsome as a judge similarly benefits from lots of amusing and playable moments in what could have been a bland role. It also should be noted that at no point does Costner get choked up and make a speech about how much he loves everybody. ""Black or White"" could have been that kind of movie but its not. Eventually what tips ""Black and White"" ever-so-slightly into the losing column is the resolution which is rushed and far-fetched. Still the movie is appealing enough to make you want to believe it even when you dont. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Updated July 29 2016  853 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Costner takes a swing at racism By Joe Williams St. Louis Post-Dispatch Joe Williams Jan 29 2015 (...) Kevin Costner is one of our whitest actors. Naturally he loves baseball and his declaration of principles in ""Bull Durham"" sounds like it could have been written by the actor himself ""I believe in ... the small of a womans back the hanging curveball high fiber and good scotch. I believe ... there ought to be a constitutional amendment outlawing AstroTurf and the designated hitter. I believe in ... opening your presents Christmas morning rather than Christmas Eve.""That last belief is an implicit endorsement of the Santa Claus story. And as blonde newscaster Megan Kelly noted in 2013 Santa like Jesus is white.""Black or White"" is a textured and unexpectedly entertaining drama about the human toll when racial assumptions crash. Like Costner who has never been better his character Elliot Anderson is a privileged white man whos welcome in Beverly Hills. Elliot is a lawyer but on the day we meet him he is a newly grieving widower and insecure guardian to granddaughter Eloise (Jillian Estell). A decade ago Eloises white mother died in childbirth and her black father has been in and out of jail so Elliot and his late wife have raised the girl themselves. Now fortified by his daily intake of alcohol hes committed to learning the little details of raising the girl from combing out her Afro to mapping out her education.Not so fast says Eloises paternal grandmother Rowena (Octavia Spencer). Rowena lives in a neighborhood in South Central LA that is far humbler than Beverly Hills but shes a successful Realtor and the matriarch to a more-or-less stable family that wants to embrace Eloise and teach her about black culture. ""Black or White"" is framed by a familiar courtroom custody case with both sides indulging in personal smears and accusations of racism but the characters are unusually layered starting with Elliot. He knows hes got a lot to learn about race and class including the right words to talk about it yet in a powerful witness-stand soliloquy by writer/director Mike Binder (""The Upside of Anger"") Elliot makes a convincing case that a white man might actually have a valid and positive point of view about the well-being of a mixed-race child. On the other side of the docket Oscar-winner Spencer (""The Help"") is a revelation in a proud protective dramatic role. And Anthony Mackie is equally good as her attorney who thinks the girls crack-addicted father (Andre Holland) is a disgrace to their race.A well-intentioned white-perspective drama like ""Black or White"" isnt going to change the world but it might change the terms of an overdue conversation.What ""Black or White""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 201  Content Brief strong language thematic material involving drug use and drinking and a fight Joe Williams  314-340-8344film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Kevin Costner back in the spotlight without a bodyguard Hollywood star takes personal approach to promote race drama ""Black or White.""

She turns in the films best performance.""Black or White"" is more remarkable for what it isnt than for what it is. For example it isnt ripe with drama. It isnt a thoughtful exploration of racial identity in America. It isnt a compelling look at judicial bias and class conflict. It is instead a movie thats every bit as oversimplified and obvious as its title.Which is a shame because it has a premise that promises all those things A White grandfather and a Black grandmother each fight for full custody of their interracial grandchild. Thats a scenario fraught with complicated questions that ""Black or White"" largely sidesteps in favor of pat infantile justifications to make the viewers feel good about themselves.When he loses his wife in a car accident grieving widower Elliot (Kevin Costner) is left to care for his adorable granddaughter Eloise (Jillian Estell) on his own. The couple had raised Eloise since her birth which claimed the life of their teenage daughter. The childs father Reggie (Andre Holland) a crack addict with a criminal history has been MIA for years.Eloise lived a cushy life with her White grandparents Elliot is a wealthy lawyer and their palatial Los Angeles home is replete with granite countertops and fine finishes -- and a ludicrously stocked bar positioned awkwardly at the center of the living area so it manages to make every shot. Thats because Elliot is an alcoholic and after his wifes death he loses himself in a bottomless bottle of scotch.Still that doesnt explain how he could possibly know so little about the granddaughter he has raised since birth. He doesnt know how to comb her fabulously curly head of hair. He doesnt know to tell her to brush her teeth. He doesnt know where her school is. They act like perfect strangers not like people who have lived together the childs whole life.Which makes one rather sympathetic toward Rowena (Octavia Spencer) Eloises Black grandmother who shows up on Elliots doorstep to propose that maybe Eloise would be happier living with her and her large loving family albeit in a less affluent part of town. Theres a good argument for that in light of Elliots heavy drinking and parental cluelessness. Instead he rebuffs Rowena completely hires a full-time tutor/designated driver and decides to battle it out in court.Then Eloises junkie father shows up just in time to play it straight for show in court and help his mother get custody. Cue a completely immature dialogue about race in which Rowenas family argues ""You just want her away from us the Black people"" and a frustrated Elliot slips and calls his granddaughters father the N-word.Its all a huge disservice to Spencer who turns in the films best performance and whose character had the most potential. Her instinct -- that her granddaughter might be happier with a large family and that she needs to explore her identity -- is not a bad one and that its tangled up with her refusal to admit her son is an unfit father makes it even more interesting. She should have been the films main character.Instead the film focuses on Elliot and the audience gets a hollow speech on the witness stand about how sometimes people slip up and say something super racist while drunk off their gourd but like doesnt everybody?So in the end a dispute that should have kick-started a needed debate turns out to be nothing that a sober heart-to-heart couldnt have resolved.Black or White2 stars (out of 5)DirectorMike Binder.CastKevin Costner Octavia Spencer Jillian Estell.RatingPG-13 for brief strong language thematic material involving drug use and drinking and for a fight.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

Comments click to enlarge Black or White Video Rated PG-13  121 minutes  2015 Kevin Costner stars as a wealthy LA lawyer raising a mixed-race granddaughter; when his wife dies the girls paternal grandparents in South Central whom Costner has long avoided sue for custody. There follow a good many conversations about race in America; some of them are thought-provoking but many feel soft-pedaled. Writer-director Mike Binder (The Upside of Anger) strains to render everyone sympathetic by creating obvious parallels between the black and white characters (both Costner and the little girls father have addiction problems) and his attempts at comic relief feel even more forced. This is undeniably well-intentioned though and the players are sensitive and sincere. With Octavia Spencer Anthony Mackie Jennifer Ehle and Bill Burr.

Jillian Estell left and Kevin Costner in a scene from ""Black or White.""(Photo Tracy Bennett AP)If only Black or White spent more time in the gray zone.While the family drama features strong performances by Octavia Spencer and Kevin Costner things seem over-simplified in this tale of a wealthy white lawyer fighting for custody of his 7-year-old biracial granddaughter. The overall story ( out of four rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) has a kind of dramatic inertia that undercuts observations about race and class and the intriguing notion of a child raised in two very different worlds.Costner however deftly conveys a man in mourning. The film opens with Elliot (Costner) sitting outside a hospital room just after learning that his beloved wife (Jennifer Ehle) was killed in a car accident.Elliot turns to the bottle for solace as well as to his beloved ultra-precocious granddaughter Eloise (Jillian Estell). The two have dealt with a lot of tragic loss in their lives though it takes almost a half hour to learn that Eloises mom also is dead.Eloise has a doting granddad in Elliot and a loving grandmother in Rowena (Spencer) but a drug-addled dad Reggie (Andre Holland).The youngster is adorable but shes one of those preternaturally wise kids who live on movie screens. She makes shrewd observations about her crotchety grandpa like ""You need to stop being so mad all the time. Its not healthy.""Elliot insists on being Eloises sole guardian when the obvious solution to the courtroom drama that takes up the bulk of the movie would be shared custody with Rowena and her big loving family. Rowena wants her granddaughter to have a sense of her roots and culture.Rattling around in his big house Elliot seems oblivious to cultural nuances. When someone at his law firm refers to his granddaughter as a black child he bristles and insists ""Shes half white."" Elliots not a racist per se -- look he hires an African tutor for his granddaughter -- but he does have disturbing moments of bigotry. He cruelly calls Reggie an offensive epithet and only feels contrite when its brought up in court.He insists Eloise is better off with him -- shes in a top private school and lives in one of the safest neighborhoods. But Rowena counters that he just doesnt want her living among black people.Like a little kid avoiding mushiness Elliot does a lot of stiffening and eye-rolling when the big-hearted Rowena attempts to hug or kiss him. Whats that about?Even with this lack of clarity Elliot is the most developed character and Costner brings him to life vividly. Rowena is strong and determined and has a weak spot where Reggie is concerned. Beyond that we learn little about her. Her younger brother Jeremiah (Anthony Mackie) is a successful lawyer though hes given no characteristics other than that of a sharp attorney who is somewhat cowed by his big sister. He does however provide one of the movies more intriguing comments when he excoriates Reggie for falling into the stereotypes that racist white people have of young black men ""You corroborate everything the white community thinks."" If only the film explored notions like this more often. The sad-eyed Reggie pulls a knife on Elliot for no good reason then later acts heroically. You can almost imagine writer-director Mike Binder writing one scene then tearing it up and re-writing treading ever so carefully in territory that seems too precarious to deeply mine. And yet the story is based on events from his own family history and may spark much-needed discussion on race relations. Give Binder credit for addressing racial divides even if not as profoundly as one would hope.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Black or White tells the story of a grieving white widower taking solo care of his biracial granddaughter after his wifes death.

Photo Credit AP / Tracy Bennett advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A white lawyer fights to keep custody of his half-black granddaughter. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE A solid cast but the racial issue is so poorly presented that the film feels unintentionally offensive. CAST Kevin Costner Olivia Spencer Anthony Mackie LENGTH 201 If the title of Mike Binders racially charged drama ""Black or White"" is meant as a question then heres the films answer white. Definitely white. Thats the skin color of its hero Elliot Anderson a well-heeled but grieving Los Angeles lawyer played by a likably gruff Kevin Costner. Elliots wife and daughter have died making him the sole caretaker of his granddaughter Eloise (Jillian Estell). Hers is a life of typical white privilege -- tony prep school large house Hispanic maid -- except that Eloise is half-black. She has another family in far-off South Central whom she never sees. Fed up the family matriarch files for custody making the damning accusation that Elliot is a racist. advertisement | advertise on newsday That setup has potential for compelling drama a high-stakes battle between two sympathetic adversaries. Think ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" augmented by the hot-button issue of race. ""Black or White"" however is rigged in Elliots favor. The film isnt hostile to its black characters exactly but it also never gives them a fighting chance. To start the case against Elliot makes little sense on its face and we see that Elliot has good reason to keep Eloise close. Her grandmother Rowena (Octavia Spencer) has a good heart but insists -- blindly weirdly -- that Eloise belongs with her father Reggie (Andre Holland) a violent drug addict. A Cochranesque lawyer Jeremiah (Anthony Mackie) plans to play the race card before a black judge (a whip-smart Paula Newsome). Elliot has a drinking problem but is otherwise a saint while Reggie repeatedly proves himself a selfish sniveling coward. Elliot does hurl a racial epithet at Reggie but he also gets to make an eloquent speech about it to the court. Oddly that speech ends with another milder slur but the film seems to consider this one acceptable -- perhaps even deserved. 223 MoviesBlack or White trailer Imagine how interesting ""Black or White"" might have been if Elliot were indeed a hidebound racist who loved his mixed-race granddaughter. Or if Eloise struggled with her racial identity instead of coming across as a mere kewpie doll. Instead ""Black or White"" takes a thoroughly one-sided view and falls into its own trap Without meaning to it manages to offend.

It is also unfortunately its own view of its material. In its story Kevin Costner is a grandfather who first lost his daughter then his wife and now has sole custody of his adorable biracial granddaughter. Octavia Spencer the childs black widowed grandmother doesnt think thats such a good idea. And so let the custody battle unnecessary public scenes and courtroom truth-telling begin. There is an interesting idea in the middle of this and a topical issue How much is culture a part of nurture? Most specifically Does it take a black family to raise a black child with all the resilience he or she is going to need? Or can a white family do just as well? Its a vital hot-button question -- which is why probably the film avoids it. Costner is grieving and for the time being at least a colossal drunk. But hes also loving attentive patient and a rich Harvard lawyer with an L.A. mansion a swimming pool and a live-in maid and sweet sort of Urkel-from-Africa tutor for the kid. Spencer is a formidable matriarch but works several jobs lives in a sloppy extended family in South Central and really wants her crackhead ex-con son to get custody so that maybe the no-account will find a reason to straighten up. So lets take another look at the players in this custody fight. On one side rich drunk who loves his granddaughter. On the other side poor addict whos barely seen the seven-year-old since birth. My my however is this going to play out in court? Im reluctant to indulge in spoilers but its not as if this movie is full of surprises. (The only welcome one? It doesnt have a scene with the tearful-but-adorable child testifying on the stand encouraging the judge to make some Solomonic decision.) As for the cast Spencer is allowed to indulge in far too much sad head-shaking and Im-just-sayin common-sense pronouncements; Costner gets one very good scene on the stand but mostly wanders around with a Scotch in his hand and his gut hanging out. Perhaps the most confusing element is Costners hallucinations of poor Jennifer Ehle who seems too young to be his late wife let alone a grandmother (the math actually works but just barely). At first I assumed she wasnt Costners spouse but his child but maybe that just comes from not living in L.A. Costner deserves credit for continuing to make -- or at least trying to make -- grown-up movies. But hes undercut at almost every point here by director Mike Binder who drowns the film in wall-to-wall pop music and is so afraid of avoiding any kind of stereotypes that he ends up avoiding the drama as well. If Costner isnt a bad man (he isnt even an alcoholic according to one character just ""angry"") then why is Spencer so determined to get full custody? If Spencers home is apart from occasional visits by her son so working-class stable and full of love then why wont Costner agree to even occasional weekend visits? This isnt a lawsuit its something that should have been settled in arbitration in a couple of hours -- or one less minute that it takes to sit through this movie. Ratings note The film contains substance abuse and some strong language. Black or White (PG-13) Relativity (121 min.) Directed by Mike Binder. With Kevin Costner Octavia Spencer.

The race card gets played again about a white grandfather (Kevin Costner in a challenging role) and a black grandmother (Octavia Spencer compelling as always) fighting for custody of an interracial grandchild with heavy but touching blows for both sides of the equation. Good acting and plenty to think about but a better director than Mike Binder would have made a better film. BLACK OR WHITE  (3/4 stars) Written and directed by Mike Binder Starring Kevin Costner Octavia Spencer and Gillian Jacobs Running time 121 min. Still grieving from the loss of their daughter despite her involvement with the irresponsible black drug addict he blames for her death during childbirth New Orleans attorney Elliot Anderson (Mr. Costner) and his wife have been raising their biracial grandchild Eloise together with every privilege. Emotionally broadsided when his wife dies suddenly in a car crash he decides nevertheless to raise the child alone when Eloises African-American grandmother Rowena Jeffers (Oscar-winning Ms. Spencer) launches an unexpected legal battle for her side of the family to seize control of the girls welfare. Both grandparents have equal rights under the law but Andersons rich over-educated white lawyers have more power--and dont mind playing dirty to prove it. In the bitter war that ensues the emotionally charged family members on both sides of the racial divide are forced to take a hard look in the mirror and rethink their own feelings fears anxieties and attitudes about prejudice in modern America. Finding solace in a bottle of Scotch Mr. Costner is forced to deal with volatile realities while playing most of his scenes drunk allowing the dynamic Ms. Spencer to steal a lot of footage. Shes the same tough ass-kicking icon she was in The Help with a better wardrobe. The movie overstacks the deck by lavishing the alcoholic white lawyer with luxury while placing the decent respectable black matriarchs home across the street from a crack den. But most of the time the characters manage to dodge cliches and Mike Binders screenplay admirably gives both families credibility and ballast while a lot of weight rests unfairly on the shoulders of the actors to overcome his lackluster direction. Although it has an uneven feel and a retro look Black or White successfully peels away the politically correct layers of false civility beneath a still-raw taboo subject in American life and gives a volatile subject contemporary relevance.

Photo Tracey Bennett MOVIE REVIEW Black or White Running time 121 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity drugs fighting). Despite excellent performances by Kevin Costner Octavia Spencer and other cast members Mike Binders racially tinged custody battle drama ""Black or White"" never achieves much in the way of dramatic credibility. Costner plays Elliot a middle-aged Southern California lawyer who has helped his wife (Jennifer Ehle) raise their 7-year-old biracial granddaughter Eloise (the terrific Jillian Estell) after their daughter died in childbirth. When the wife suddenly passes away the childs other grandmother Rowena (Spencer) who operates several small businesses gently suggests to the grief-stricken and overwhelmed Elliot -- whose alcohol intake has accelerated after his wifes death -- that Eloise should spend more time with Rowena and her extended black family in South Central. Elliot gruffly ignores the offer and Rowenas nephew (Anthony Mackie) also a lawyer urges her into family court -- where Elliot and his legal partners are prepared to fight even the judges quite reasonable suggestion of joint custody tooth and nail. None of this really passes the smell test but Binders overheated script really goes off the deep end when Eloises long-missing crack-addict dad (a heartbreaking Andre Holland) shows up in Elliots office demanding a payoff to stay out of the custody case. Jillian Estell and Kevin Costner in ""Black or White.""Photo Tracy Bennett Even a lawyer with a drinking problem like Elliot would know better than to pay a bribe but thats exactly what he does -- solely because it ratchets up the drama. Things become more bonkers from there with the judge in the case (a superb Paula Newsome) allowing all sorts of shenanigans that would get everybody thrown out of court in real life. There are some very nice quiet moments -- especially when Elliot interacts with Eloise who is understandably confused by adults acting like petulant children -- but in the course of two long hours the film builds to a truly preposterous climax. Elliots wife unfortunately makes periodic mute appearances as a ghost -- a device that becomes positively ridiculous when she turns up in a swimming pool into which Elliot has fallen during an altercation with Eloises dad. Costner (who reportedly paid for the movie out of his own pocket) and Binder (who previously directed Costner in ""The Upside of Anger) seem to think theyre making a profound statement about race relations in ""Black or White."" Alas its more like an incoherent one.

Thats one baffling turn in Mike Binders Black or White a movie about race in America that for all its efforts at broad-minded truth-telling cant resist insisting its crotchety old white-guy hero is right about everything even when he comes right out and calls the young black man who fathered his grandchild a ""street nigger."" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Not since the last Dinesh DSouza flick has a movie seemed so eager to tell us who are the good black people and who the bad ones. One black character upbraids another for coming across like what racist whites might think black folks are like ""Youre a goddamn cliche A perfect stereotype"" lawyer Jeremiah (Anthony Mackie) says to Reggie (Andre Holland) a sad-eyed addict and deadbeat dad. If only Reggie could respond ""Why arent you yelling at the writer-director who imagined me?""Illustrating how weird this all gets demands we plow through a lot of plot. Here goes A consummately rumpled Kevin Costner plays well-heeled just-widowed power-lawyer Elliott suddenly the primary caregiver for his granddaughter Eloise (Jillian Estell) a moppet so blessed in cutes/charisma that you feel when youre fortunate enough to regard her something like what a cat must as it stretches out where the sun hits the floor.Film Details Black or White RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time121 More Info Trailer Elliotts daughter now dead conceived Eloise with Reggie the onetime crack smoker who claims hes gotten his life back together. Hes urged into pursuing custody of Eloise by his mother Rowena (Octavia Spencer) who presses her brother Jeremiah into siccing his own law firm on the case. Elliott responds by marshaling the lawyers he works with -- and the result is two hours of sleepy hard-to-swallow legal wrangling that really could have used a polish from the Good Wife writers room.The film is being promoted as a clash between Costner and Spencer but were only treated to a couple of dustups between these outsized stars -- and after the initial confrontations Binders script isnt fair or clever enough to let them both be right. One exchange is as sharp as you might hope for. Spencers Rowena suggests that Elliotts reluctance to bring Eloise around to South Central to visit her black relatives might have something to do with race.""What is it with you?"" Elliott snarls. ""Why do you always have to go there?""She replies ""What is it with you? You cant admit theres a there there""Those two lines offer more truth about race in America than the rest of the movie. Rather than participate in this difficult conversation Elliott attacks the very idea that race is even worth talking about. Later he complains again almost admitting that his subject-changing is a stratagem ""Why do you always have to checkmate me with this shit?"" he asks as if the great injustice of American inequality is that he sometimes loses arguments. Too bad then that Binder never lets Rowena win another writing her as a blinkered fool whose only motive for taking Eloise from Elliott seems to be the belief that black kids should only be raised in black homes. Almost as dispiriting In court she yaps her every thought right at the judge like shes talking back on Maury.Binders better at the brisk affecting scenes of single parenting with Costner and Estell aglow together. But there are too many shots of hard-drinking Elliott sneaking ""Glencallan"" a whiskey made up for movies and TV shows as well as some miserably flat comedy involving Mpho Koaho as an entrepreneurial-minded tutor from Africa another goddamn cliche/perfect stereotype.Binders attempts to humanize his black characters make them cartoons. The tutor mentions that his family was killed along with hundreds of others in his village and the moments much too light almost a joke all about giving Elliott perspective on his problems. Something similar happens when Elliott visits Rowenas home where many generations of convivial relatives sit around having a grand old time -- in the middle of the morning on a school day. If Binder wants to upend white expectations about life in south L.A. couldnt he have conjured up some jobs?The nadir comes by way of the ugly scenes between Elliott and Reggie. Holland plays Reggie with the tender desperation of a recovering addict Hes tentative secretive a little shy and only insistent when talking about how hes doing better now. He hits Elliott up for money implying that for a price hell drop the suit and go away but this plays out like a ruse like an attempt to prove to the family court that Elliott is unethical. Reggies a mess and a disappointment to Eloise but somethings off in the cruel way Elliott belittles him at every opportunity insisting to Rowenas face that her son is still a junkie who cant ever be trusted. The movies coy about Reggies drug use even after Elliott tosses that slur into his face and even milks this for suspense Is Elliott a pitiless racist? Or is this harrowed young man fooling his too-doting mother and still on the pipe? Since Elliott is for all his flaws a loving and committed caregiver the guardian its clear Eloise should stay with Binder is asking viewers to do the unconscionable to root for the young black man to be the stereotype.Occasionally the film rouses into something thoughtful even daring. Put on the stand in family court Elliott is asked directly whether or not he is a racist. At first he evades playing the victim again. But then he gives a long honest painful answer one that Costner seems to tear out of himself one rich in what that character feels is the truth. Moments like this or Costners first fracas with Spencer hint at the film we might have gotten if anyone else onscreen were given this chance not to be good or bad but to be a person speaking actual thoughts.Written and directed by Mike Binder.

Thatd be too harsh an assessment even if theres a kernel of truth to it. And the fact remains that ""Black or White"" frames the custody fight for the effectively orphaned eight-year-old Eloise (Jillian Estell) between wealthy attorney Elliot (Kevin Costner) and lower-middle-class but hyper-entrepreneurial Rowena (Octavia Spencer) -- the little girls maternal grandfather and paternal grandmother respectively -- as a black intrusion into white terrain. See video Kevin Costner Fights to Raise His Granddaughter in First Black or White Trailer (Exclusive Video) To be sure Elliot isnt anyones idea of the ideal parent. After the death of his wife (Jennifer Ehle) he takes to the bottle early and often. To ensure Eloise completes her homework (and to serve sometimes as his designated driver) Elliot hires an African-immigrant tutor (a winsome Mpho Koaho) who casually informs his new employer during their first meeting that he witnessed the massacre of his family as a young boy. ""Black or White"" is full of such tonal dissonances; the academically gifted Eloise often talks like a toddler (and seems bizarrely incurious about the sudden disappearance of her grandmother) while the soundtracks twinkling music feels imported from a much lighter movie. Also read Kevin Costner Chases the American Dream in McFarland USA Trailer (Video) There are several valid reasons why Eloise who grew up with Elliot and his wife after her mother died giving birth to her should stay with her grandfather for stabilitys sake if nothing else. But the films strategy in arguing for Elliots custody is to denigrate Rowenas family especially her drug-addicted son (and Eloises biological father) Reggie played by Andre Holland and her brother (Anthony Mackie) a high-powered attorney who isnt above playing dirty by painting Elliot as a racist in court to win Rowena full custody of Eloise. ""Black or White"" gradually offers a lurid mystery regarding just how bad Reggie is as when he attempts to extort 25000 from Elliot in exchange for endorsing the latter as the rightful guardian in court. But discovering those new depths make for a disheartening experience especially since the character (and his complicated relationship with his mother) eventually suggests that despite Rowenas selflessness in taking in a variety of nieces and nephews and grandchildren over the years her family will never be good enough for Eloise even if all the children play in an adorable but improbable jazz ensemble. A rousing and fair debate between the little girls white grandfather and black grandmother would have lent the film some badly needed dramatic urgency. But ""Black or White"" takes a side -- that of the beleaguered white man -- a narrative choice that becomes all the more frustrating when Elliots speeches in court are portrayed as impassioned or wryly clever. (Costner gets one rather moving and ambitious monologue about overcoming racism as a continual process not a terminal endpoint.) Also read Red Band Societys Octavia Spencer Reveals How Samuel L. Jackson Taught Her to Cry On-Camera (Video) Rowenas attempts to express herself on the other hand are presented only as inappropriate outbursts. Nor is Rowena ever afforded the opportunity to expound her most compelling reasons for seeking Eloises guardianship which are briefly mentioned at the films beginning then never referenced again. By the films end the ""Black or White"" raises only one question Is its racial-baiting disingenuous or oblivious? Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Review Kevin Costner shines in Mike Binders nervy Black or White - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Kevin Costner shines in Mike Binders nervy Black or White Black or White Tracy Bennett / Relativity Media Kevin Costner and Jillian Estell star in Relativity Medias ""Black or White."" Kevin Costner and Jillian Estell star in Relativity Medias ""Black or White."" (Tracy Bennett / Relativity Media) Gary Goldstein Black or White boldly goes places our national discourse on race relations largely fails to go In a leaner year for lead actors Kevin Costner would be more of an Oscar contender for his terrific turn as a beleaguered grandfather in Mike Binders nervy race-relations dramedy ""Black or White."" Whether Costner makes the awards cut or not its a pleasure to watch the veteran actor so deftly traverse the vanity-free demands of such a flawed authentic toughly sympathetic character.Writer-director Binder who previously worked with Costner in the fine 2005 film ""The Upside of Anger"" has crafted an all-too timely tale inspired by an episode from his own family history. True Binders well-intended approach to the movies socio-racial schematics may prove divisive; for all its modern smarts theres a sporadic ""Guess Whos Coming to Dinner"" vibe at play that can feel dated. More important however the filmmaker and his on-screen proxies boldly go places our national discourse desperately needs to go yet rarely does. Costner plays Elliot an affluent Scotch-guzzling Los Angeles lawyer whose wife Carol (Jennifer Ehle) is killed in a car accident. Her death leaves him alone with their 7-year-old biracial granddaughter Eloise (a wonderful Jillian Estell) whom they have been raising since her mother -- Elliot and Carols daughter -- died at 17 in childbirth.Enter Eloises paternal grandmother Rowena aka Grandma Wee Wee (Octavia Spencer a kick) an irrepressible entrepreneurial force of nature who decides now that the capable Carol is gone to seek custody of Eloise and bring the child to live with her extended family in Compton. With Rowenas slick lawyer brother Jeremiah (Anthony Mackie) leading the charge an ugly daunting twisty court battle ensues. Meanwhile Eloises absentee father Reggie (Andre Holland) a rudderless drug addict with a rap sheet returns to L.A. purportedly cleaned up and hoping to reconnect with Eloise. But Elliots disdain for Reggie the man he feels ruined his late daughters life will fuel much of the films conflict in ways that prove more physically and emotionally painful -- and brutally honest -- than Elliots tussling with the equitable Rowena. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link Binder balances the humor and pathos here for crowd-pleasing moments amusing exchanges between the voluble Rowena and a slow-burn judge (a spot-on Paula Newsome) the endearing wonkiness of Eloises African-immigrant math tutor (Mpho Koaho) and lovely interactions between the precious Eloise and an at-sea Elliot. (Whenever this gruff grandpa tenderly calls her ""puppy"" its lump-in-throat time.)Binder works to address racial issues head on without shying away from the proverbial elephants in the room. An example Just when one cant help think the crack-smoking deadbeat Reggie is a dreadful cliche Jeremiah flat-out dubs his nephew a ""perfect stereotype."" Its a disarming largely effective strategy. Black or White Tracy Bennett / Relativity Media Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer star in Relativity Medias ""Black or White."" Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer star in Relativity Medias ""Black or White."" (Tracy Bennett / Relativity Media) At the same time it can feel as if Binder is constantly attempting to square matters to justify his characters actions motivations and personas. Maybe its a way to satisfy (pacify?) the broadest swath of viewers -- and maybe its simply unavoidable. But it proves a tricky juggling act whose seams are more visible than not. Still when Binders script is at its best such as when Elliots unfortunate use of the N-word leads him to deliver a frank and climactic courtroom speech were grateful for the chances ""Black or White"" takes and for the all-important grays it so often brings to light.calendarlatimes.com------------Black or WhiteMPAA rating PG-13 for brief strong language thematic material involving drug use and drinking fighting (on appeal)Running time 2 hours 1 minutePlaying iPic Westwood Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Kevin Costner wins another MPAA appeal; Black and White gets a PG-13 Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad78deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-black-white-movie-review-20141203-story.html,200,blackorwhite24,blackorwhite,latimes
"Toronto Film Festival Diary Sexy Pop Star Falls for Sexy L.A. Cop and Drunk Kevin Costner Fights for His Black Granddaughter << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Toronto Film Festival Diary Sexy Pop Star Falls for Sexy L.A. Cop and Drunk Kevin Costner Fights for His Black Granddaughter Blackbird Productions/Suzanne Tenner Movies September 12 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print So the festival is almost over and many of us are going home with our minds unblown. A couple of days ago I saluted the momentary decline in so-called Oscar bait -- no Gravity and no 12 Years a Slave. But that also means theres been no Gravity and no 12 Years a Slave -- not even a Silver Linings Playbook or gulp Slumdog Millionaire. Even if they werent being promoted as award-worthy theyd still be films you very much wanted to see. Click here for more 2014 awards season coverage. New movies by David Fincher Paul Thomas Anderson and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu have skipped Toronto on their way to the New York Film Festival which starts in a couple of weeks. But setting aside the usual holdovers from Cannes this year Toronto has also seen a dearth of a different sort of high-profile movie nothing by Michael Haneke or Claire Denis or Lucrecia Martel or Fatih Akin or Carlos Reygadas -- modestly budgeted major works of art movies that take you somewhere youve never been somewhere that surprises you movies that can cleave an audience in half or unite people in either bliss or enlightened contempt. The German director Christian Petzold has a new movie here -- a Holocaust drama called Phoenix -- that fits the bill. I keep missing it. But people are talking about it as a film they find either exhilarating or exasperatingly illogical. Thats the ticket. This sort of movie with a directors strong point of view is the lifeblood of a festival even one with as densely packed a slate as Toronto. Without many strong entries from both classes of movie this place can feel hollow as a moviegoing experience. Its not the festivals fault but a weak year does remind you how high the bars been raised. In the meantime you have to see something. So this morning I caught Beyond the Lights a romantic drama about Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) an ascendant biracial pop star from working-class England and the aspiring black politician Kaz (Nate Parker) who by day (and sometimes by night) works as an LAPD officer. The presentation is on its surface absurd but its worry about what fame does to women is legitimate. Depressed by the demands of fame Noni pushes herself off a hotel balcony. Kaz is there to grab her hand and haul her up from death. ""I see you"" he tells Noni understanding that her concern is that no one knows the real her. Soon her stage mother (Minnie Driver) has them both lying to a skeptical press that the incident was a drunken accident. (Nonis desperately anticipated debut album is weeks away from release) Noni asks Kaz to be her one-man security detail. Yes its also The Bodyguard or not unlike it. But instead of a serial-killer plot director Gina Prince-Bythewood has Noni stalked by the media and tormented by her corrosive unhappiness with what the marketplace (and her mommy) wants her to be Ciara. Its a good swap. Prince-Bythewood is allowed to get into matters of hypersexuality and music-biz chauvinism. The issues of race that really werent an issue in The Bodyguard get an Obama-era treatment. Nonis boyfriend is a white American rapper (MGK) who gets aggressive with her during a live performance at the BET Awards. Cue a kerfuffle thats more Source Awards but still. Meanwhile Kazs father (Danny Glover) worries that this scantily clad scandal magnet ""isnt First Lady material."" But the movie doesnt want to over-racialize the identity politics. Generically its just a tale of being who you are which in Nonis case isnt a pinup like Ciara. Its a singer-songwriter like Corinne Bailey Rae. When this movie comes out in November you can see the transformation for yourself. The politics for Prince-Bythewood amount to making a very commercial love story between two black people that isnt about how black they are. This was also true of her best-known film Love amp; Basketball. She can find the right tone of sweetness and honesty between actors. Her lovers here push each other to be their most authentic selves. I dont know why Noni couldnt just perform the songs she wrote years ago and stuffed in a shoe box. Maybe she suspected her mother couldnt imagine a world that would want to hear a beautiful black woman make such allegedly confessional music. Noni clearly feels pimped out and has come to believe with her mothers approval that its best to behave accordingly. The movie saves only a little drama for Nonis mama. Otherwise Prince-Bythewood doesnt explore any of the psychological stuff. The use of two Nina Simone songs is meant to signify artistic and racial truth the way a Sex Pistols or Ramones T-shirt worn by a white guy is meant to in other movies. You can certainly imagine the lurid critique of 21st-century pop stardom that a director like David Lynch might perform. Prince-Bythewood might have anticipated that expectation. Instead she heavily concentrates on how good Parker and Mbatha-Raw are together. Theyre not the strongest actors. They do have a strongish presence though especially Parker -- he looks like the Denzel Washington of 28 years ago but a version whose default expression is the one people make upon seeing a witheringly sick dunk. These two manage to get away together for about 15 minutes of screen time and their chemistry transforms the rest of the movie. They start out in The Bodyguard and wind up in Roman Holiday.  The first sequence in Beyond the Lights shows Nonis white mother taking her to a black hairdresser desperate to find a solution for her daughters curls. I went from that to Kevin Costner dealing with the same problem in the opening minutes of Mike Binders Black and White. This is a tiresome interracial custody dramedy in which white non-guilt righteously dukes it out with black melodrama. Its like Tyler Perrys Crash. Costner plays a freshly widowed high-powered frequently drunk Los Angeles attorney whose white daughter gave birth to a black girl and then died minutes later -- nominally of a medical condition but really of shame. (She hid the pregnancy from her loving parents.) Obviously the babys black father (Andre Holland) is a crack addict whos been in and out of prison. Costners wife (Jennifer Ehle) has died when the movie opens and the infants paternal grandmother (Octavia Spencer) who was friends with Costners wife hires her high-powered attorney brother (Anthony Mackie) to sue for custody. Just as a piece of storytelling the movies preposterous. Theres absolutely no reason for this case to stay in a courtroom -- even though the uncredited actress playing that judge nearly pockets the film. How can either lawyers firm afford to devote its top talent to this suit? When the judge asks why joint custody is out of the question the racial answer is extralegal and the legal answer is murky. The fact of Costners alcoholism is a screenwriting device meant to morally balance the fathers drug addiction. Whos falling for that? Its the criminal-justice equivalent of calling Zima beer. Whenever the film ought be thinking about class and racial perception and mixed-raced extended families it gives Costner dreams of the dead wife and makes the crackhead father do the damnedest things instead. The whole movie exists for a speech Costner gives under cross-examination. Its remarkable for its candor about noticing race versus being a racist and for Costners emotional delivery. Hes reached a point in his stardom at which he makes only ridiculous films in which he never seems at all ridiculous. Otherwise Binder (The Upside of Anger HBOs The Mind of the Married Man) has no idea how or what to write for any character other than Costners. Its as if -- like Paul Haggis who wrote and directed Crash -- hes been holding on to those feelings for decades and finally found a contraption to build around them. Anyone else in this movie could have delivered that speech or one similar. But I do like that once forced into thinking about race Costners character has actual thoughts. The black characters just believe that the girl should be with them as a matter of philosophy the screenwriting doesnt allow them to argue. Spencer gets to be a ham with a part thats part savvy part nincompoop. Binder puts her characters big home right next to a drug den you suspect Spencer would have had shut down years ago. Her role has none of the wisdom or aplomb or decorum youd expect from a middle-class woman who owns six businesses and perfumes her South Los Angeles neighborhood with generosity -- or from Spencer. Her son is supposed to be a blind spot; you just dont believe this actress would be a mother this blind. That sort of willful cluelessness is the only thing Binder has in common with her.  I couldnt allow that to be my last film at this festival. So I found something like the kind of film thats been missing here something with life ideas and fully realized human beings. Formally Laurent Cantets Return to Ithaca is pretty simple. Its five middle-aged Cuban friends spending the evening together on the roof of one mans apartment building. They dance and laugh at first. But the conversations head into their resentment of the ways in which the Castro government has exploited their sense of national hope -- embittered and terrified them ruining their families and careers and stability. The title is from Homers Odyssey. Here it refers to the decade that one of the friends a writer named Amadeo (Nestor Jimenez) spent out of the country. To the surprise and resentment of everyone else hes come home to stay. The film builds to his explanation for departing so abruptly and it is moving. So are the airings of hard feelings and pungent memories. The revolutions damage is generations deep. The film dramatizes its characters hourly wrestling with what it costs both to remain in the country and to flee from it. Cantet composed the script with the Cuban writer Leonardo Padura Fuentes and the Frenchmans style is the same fly-on-the-wall approach he used for his most acclaimed movie 2008s public-education drama The Class. He fosters this seamless improvisatory air that takes you from eavesdropping to absorption. One of the thrills of watching these actors together is that you feel 40 years of friendship among them along with all the attendant particularly Cuban complexities of remaining close. Even the decision to come to a dinner party armed with gifts can turn political. Id never seen any of these actors before. But I wanted to thank each of them for baring a part of their souls.

The good news is that Kevin Costner does some of the finest most deeply felt work of his career as a widower lawyer fighting for custody of his biracial granddaughter in Mike Binders ""Black and White."" The bad news is that this well-intentioned family drama never quite shakes free from its didactic movie-of-the-week dramaturgy and a hand-holding approach to race-relations thats as if ""Guess Whos Coming to Dinner"" had been made only five minutes ago. The even worse news is that in the moment of Trayvon Martin Michael Brown and the Birther movement a movie like this might be just what America needs right about now. Unlikely to match the 28 million worldwide take of Costner and Binders 2005 teaming ""The Upside of Anger"" ""Black"" should connect with select older and urban auds but lacks the broader crossover potential of a ""Crash"" or ""The Help."" Maybe because Costner became a star playing golden-boy athletes military men and noble crusaders its particularly affecting to see him at almost 60 wider of girth and thinner of hair playing battered and broken-down. When ""Black and White"" opens his Elliot Anderson has just lost his wife (Jennifer Ehle seen in flashback) in a car crash leaving him the sole guardian of their preteen granddaughter Eloise (spunky newcomer Jillian Estell) whose mother -- Elliots daughter -- died during childbirth. As for Eloises dad Reggie (Andre Holland) hes described as a deadbeat with a long history of drug problems who never took an interest in Eloises life. The same though cannot be said for Reggies mother Rowena (a solid if typecast Octavia Spencer) a big-hearted love machine with a thriving real estate career and a sprawling extended family all living with her or nearby in South L.A. With Elliot now on his own and sulking about in an alcoholic depression Rowena a.k.a. Grandma Wee Wee quite reasonably proposes that Eloise should spend more time with her and the girls cousins. And when an indignant Elliot balks at the mere suggestion of shared custody Grandma Wee Wee takes Grandpa Honkey to court. When a liberal-minded director like Binder makes a movie entitled ""Black and White"" its a safe bet that the title is meant ironically and that by the time the end credits roll well have been sufficiently reminded that where race is concerned there are only shades of grey. But for much of its running time Binders film traffics in the very dichromatic terms it seeks to avoid making facile juxtapositions of Elliots antiseptic West L.A. existence (where the only faces of color are those polishing the floors and trimming the perfectly manicured hedgerows) against the boisterous rainbow coalition that thrives south of the 10 Freeway (complete with the nice lesbian couple who live across the street). Things get a touch more complicated when Rowenas lawyer brother (Anthony Mackie) arrives on the scene and suggests that the quickest road to a successful custody trial is to paint Elliot as a closeted racist but a racist nevertheless. Then Reggie abruptly reappears claiming to be a reformed man and takes up the custody petition himself which only stokes Elliots ire and leads to an (all too predictable) Donald Sterling-style outburst at the least opportune moment. But does that make Elliot a racist? Somewhere in ""Black and White"" lies the seed of a more challenging provocative film about how the proverbial ""race card"" gets played in the courtroom and in the media and whether or not one can dislike someone of another race -- in our hyper-p.c. times -- without being judged a bigot. But whenever Binder seems on the verge of trekking into genuinely murky sociopolitical waters he falls back on convention letting the film devolve into an enervating overlong courtroom drama that makes ""Gran Torino"" seem like ""Do the Right Thing."" Because every time we see Reggie hes either missing an appointed rendezvous with Eloise or surrounded by bad-news homies from his past the movie never seriously entertains the notion that he might have turned over a new leaf (a particular shame given that Holland the brilliant young star of ""The Knick"" on Cinemax deserves a more complex role to play). Nor do we ever really suspect that Elliot is a bad guy despite his obvious attachment to the bottle (which Binder emphasizes by having Costner tipsily tote one around in seemingly all his scenes). And when Binder doesnt know how resolve things he stages an incredibly hokey violent confrontation that like the one in Alan Parkers otherwise excellent family drama ""Shoot the Moon"" feels like a cheap unearned way of bringing down the curtain. Throughout Costner is the glue holding this balsa-wood enterprise together finding shades of nobility and moral compromise in a character whos been written as too much of a milquetoast Archie Bunker -- a conduit for white suburbanites with too many deadbolts on their doors. Unlike a lot of stars once celebrated for their matinee-idol genes hes unafraid to look old and somewhat tired onscreen and to play against his ingratiating everyman charms. Even saddled with subpar material he achieves a state of actorly grace. Toronto Film Review Black and WhiteReviewed at Toronto Film Festival (Gala Presentations) September 6 2014. MPAA Rating PG-13.

Pitting a binge drinking Kevin Costner against an ass whooping Octavia Spencer in a battle for custody over their beloved granddaughter this well-performed and occasionally amusing affair has a distinctively 90s feel to it laying on the sauce rather thick at times although it still creates a believable story raising questions about parenthood and racial prejudice in modern-day Los Angeles. Star wattage could eventually help give these colors a decent boost at the box office though theyll most likely run brightest on the small screen. A somewhat clumsy opening scene introduces us to California attorney Elliot Anderson (Costner) whose wife has just died in a car accident leaving the man with little consolation outside a home bar fully stocked with Scotch. But he does have one remaining hope in life his mixed-race 7-year-old granddaughter Eloise (newcomer Jillian Estell) whos been living with him ever since the girls mother died at childbirth and her drug addicted father Reggie (Andre Holland) landed in jail. Trying to cope with his granddaddy duties as he slowly drinks himself into oblivion Elliot manages to keep things afloat for the time being especially after hiring an overqualified math tutor Duvan (Mpho Koaho) to serve as right-hand man and provide some necessary comic relief to the household. Yet just when things are picking up hes paid a visit by Eloises paternal grandmother Rowena (Spencer) a loving but iron-fisted matriarch whose boggle-eyed glare is enough to push back an army and who soon takes it upon herself to demand custody of her granddaughter through the help of hotshot nephew lawyer Jeremiah (Anthony Mackie). ""Inspired by a true incident"" per the opening credits the screenplay by Binder paints a broad but credible portrait of a fractured family living on opposite sides of L.A.s racial barrier with Elliot carousing around his massive suburban mansion while Rowena shelters relatives in a Compton abode across the street from a crack den. Yet neither household is shown to be a total movie cliche and the script intelligently navigates both domains to reveal how they have more in common than they may imagine especially when it concerns the best interests of their granddaughter. As Rowena blindly (and not always understandably) continues her legal pursuits just as Reggie pops back into the picture the race question is eventually brought into play and even becomes a major factor in the ensuing trial especially after Elliot drops an n-bomb thats used against him in court. Various plot mechanics some of them rather heavy-handed (Is Reggie really dumb enough to smoke crack on the porch in front of his mothers house?) lead to a resolution that predictably shows how little race ultimately matters although Black and White never panders too easily to sentiments creating characters who are riddled with flaws but likeable all the same. Such is the case with Elliot and as both producer and star this is clearly Costners film for the taking. Its a pleasure to see the seasoned actor approaching this kind of role after a recent run of genre-related material (Man of Steel 3 Days to Kill) reteaming with Binder (who he worked with on The Upside of Anger) to play a man whose life has been riddled with tragedy but who still has a fighting spirit and dark sense of humor. (Costner can also still play a convincing drunk which is no easy task.) The rest of the cast is excellent starting with Spencer and her guns-a-blazing portrayal of Rowena and moving down to the terrific young Koaho who sparks the most laughs with his depiction of an African immigrant whos the smartest guy in the room and not afraid to say it. While the acting is strong and the storytelling smoothly handled theres nothing all that distinguishing about the direction itself and the film often has the look and feel of something made in the early 1990s especially when it overuses a rather schmaltzy score by jazzman Terence Blanchard (Inside Man). Indeed the presence of Costner (who definitely looks young for a granddad) could further situate Black and White a few decades ago and only the occasional iPad is there to remind us that for better or for worse race matters as much now as it did back then.
