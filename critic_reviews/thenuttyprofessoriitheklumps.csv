Remember the raucous family gatherings in ""The Nutty Professor"" that had Eddie Murphy playing five different characters at the same crowded dinner table? Be prepared to laugh less at a lot more of the same thing in this overbearing but underwhelming sequel. Opening weekend B.O. numbers should be huge but a rapid drop-off is likely if not inevitable as discouraging word of mouth spreads. Long-term ancillary prospects are marginally rosier. Offering incontrovertible proof that more is less ""Nutty Professor II The Klumps"" tries too hard to do too much to top its 1996 smash-hit predecessor. Remember the raucous family gatherings in ""The Nutty Professor"" that had Eddie Murphy playing five different characters at the same crowded dinner table? Be prepared to laugh less at a lot more of the same thing in this overbearing but underwhelming sequel. Opening weekend B.O. numbers should be huge but a rapid drop-off is likely if not inevitable as discouraging word of mouth spreads. Long-term ancillary prospects are marginally rosier. The first ""Professor"" -- a much-improved remake of Jerry Lewis 1963 take on the ""Jekyll and Hyde"" story -- revolved around the misadventures of Sherman Klump a grossly overweight genius who developed a split personality while testing an experimental serum on himself. Each time he took a swig of his unstable elixir the shy professor morphed into Buddy Love a flashy-dressing smooth-talking swinger who looked and sounded a lot like -- well Eddie Murphy (or at least like the Eddie Murphy of everyones deepest secret suspicions). It didnt take long for Buddy to attempt a hostile takeover forcing Sherman to battle his alter ego to regain control of the body they time-shared. With a little help from Oscar-winning makeup wiz Rick Baker Murphy was a world-class hoot in both lead roles. With a little more of Bakers help Murphy was equally hilarious in his brief bits as four other members of the Klump clan garrulous Papa sweetly exuberant Mama surly brother Ernie and sassy geezer Granny. All of the Klumps are back in ""Nutty Professor II"" and each gets a bigger slice of the action as the sequel shamelessly attempts to exploit and expand the most crowdpleasing bits and pieces of the 1996 original. Sherman is the nominal hero of the story once again distracted by romantic longings as he toils on modern miracles of science and once again winningly played by Murphy as an older wiser and college-educated version of Bill Cosbys Fat Albert. There is something ineffably touching about Murphys portrayal of Sherman as a gently sensitive behemoth who laughs -- but doesnt smile -- when hes mocked for his gargantuan girth. Trouble is there isnt enough of the big lug in the sequel because his attention-grabbing relatives repeatedly upstage him. At first the special effects in ""Nutty Professor II"" are so eye-poppingly prodigious that its easy to overlook the repetitiveness of the plotting and the coarseness of the humor. The interactions among the Murphy-Klump quintet are smooth seamless and often downright astonishing especially when one Eddie Murphy addresses another Eddie Murphy then turns to embrace yet a third Eddie Murphy who in turn says something to a fourth and a fifth. Youre never entirely unaware that its really the same actor beneath each accumulation of latex and foam-rubber prosthetics. But director Peter Segal and his all-pro production crew -- including makeup master Baker and visual effects supervisor Jon Farhat -- make it childishly simple to make frequent leaps of the imagination and to accept each Murphy as a uniquely amusing individual. Unfortunately the special effects are almost too extraordinary for the movies own good. Since its so easy to accept the illusion of five separate and distinct characters the novelty value of that illusion starts to wane about a third of the way into ""Nutty Professor II."" To put it bluntly you take the magic for granted. And once you stop marveling at the high-tech trickery you begin to notice how much of the movie relies on lame jokes about flatulence sexual dysfunction animal excrement and the indefatigable horniness of Granny Klump to say nothing of a gag involving the anal rape of a college dean (Larry Miller) by a chemically enhanced hamster or the opening dream sequence in which Eddie Murphy makes a special guest appearance as the throbbing bulge in Sherman Klumps trousers. Just as ""Scary Movie"" expanded the boundaries for R-rated respectability ""Nutty Professor II"" raises the limit for what passes for PG-13 entertainment. The previous ""Nutty Professor"" dabbled in rude and crude raunchiness as well but not quite so frequently and desperately as the sequel which often plays like an illustrated party record. Buddy Love also returns in ""Nutty Professor II"" despite Sherman Klumps best efforts to literally drain the intruder out of his DNA. Sherman manages to isolate and extract an errant gene that is the last remaining trace of his own private Mr. Hyde. But the gene inadvertently mutates with a strand of dog hair -- trust me you dont want to know how -- and the result is a brave new Buddy who likes to chase cats play fetch and sniff the air for traces of lovely ladies. This sly hound dog makes a play for Shermans new sweetheart a brilliant scientist played with improbable persuasiveness by pop star Janet Jackson. But even with his canine accouterments Buddy simply isnt as funny the second time around. For that matter neither are the Klumps.

He devises an experiment to cast the vicious-swinger alter ego out of his hulking body and Buddy free at last begins to saunter around town and also to chase the occasional tennis ball and poke his head out of car windows since he has accidentally been cross-fertilized with a dogs DNA (dont even ask). Its easy to understand why Sherman would want this guy purged from his system. As Buddy Eddie Murphy appearing in the guise of his rascally ""old"" self tries to inject the movie with a speedball of malevolent joy but hes antsy and high-strung flashing an auto-destruct rictus smile that might look ironic if it werent so deadly forced. In last summers Bow-finger Murphy overdid the scaredy-cat paranoia and hes hardly more relaxed now. When did this fearless comic smoothie turn into such a tightly wired pop-eyed hysteric? Buddy of course is meant to be Shermans id and the movies as well but here even more glaringly than in his triumphant 1996 version of The Nutty Professor Murphy as Murphy is the least funny thing on screen. Its Granny Klump whos the real id of Nutty Professor II. Each time Murphy as Granny shows up in powdery white hair with an icky grin of gums and sparse teeth a body coiled over in geriatric resentment and a voice so basso and venomous it could practically be channeling Satan he gives his lines a whiplash sting and the movie carries a charge. This little old lady isnt just mean -- shes lusty and proud of it. At one point she just about ravishes Buddy in an alleyway and her slavering attempts at seduction are so grotesque that laughter and disgust mingle in the audience with hilarious queasiness. Jumping up and down in a field of flowers her big sagging breasts bouncing in slow motion from her knees Granny far more than Buddy lets Murphy tap the jubilant demons hes still got inside him. The Klumps are a loud boorish neurotically backbiting clan who can scarcely step on each others insults fast enough. The women are frumpy the men bald and grouchy and big-bellied. Middle-aged or older the whole family seems stuck in the pre-hip-hop era and that may be partly why Murphy seems more comfortable in their flabby skins designed by the ingenious Rick Baker than he does in his own. He has a special flair for playing the women Granny of course but also the sweet pursed-lipped perpetually beaming Mama Klump. With his scoldingly hopped-up down-home delivery Murphy as the Klumps gets as deep into character as Richard Pryor did doing Mudbone to the point that he intentionally throws away many of his best lines. Papa Klump to Granny barking under his breath ""Youre startin to look like one of those Zulu hags on National Geographic"" I have no idea if Murphy improvised that line but I wouldnt be surprised. Everything the Klumps say seems to rumble up from inside their corpulent roly-poly flesh. If The Klumps feels like a major comedown from The Nutty Professor thats partly because the novelty is gone but also because the picture is messy and scattershot with a plot thats little more than a dirty version of Flubber. This time the center doesnt quite hold -- that center of course being the blimpy brainiac Sherman with his nervous polite chuckle his tank-on-the-dance-floor 70s soul moves. Though Murphys performance is every bit as understated as it was the first time Sherman is no longer a fresh creation a slyly touching confession of Murphys own insecurity. Since the character has already conquered his self-hatred and won the affections of the pretty professor Denise Gaines (Janet Jackson looking as airbrushed as she does on a CD) he seems quaint and predictable now. The director Peter Segal and his team of screenwriters come up with the gimmick of having Sherman via the Buddy Love separation experiment gradually lose his intelligence. Theres one lively scene Sherman at dinner with Denises parents uses a corncob to launch into a scramblingly idiotic and raunchy explanation of his latest theorem. The movie though needed more of that sort of verbal china-shop bashing. The Sherman-as-idiot idea is never exploited for its full madcap potential. Instead its the film that grows dumber though in a boisterously crude way thats occasionally amusing. The giant hamster who gets friendly with Larry Millers dean may be the most roguish anthropomorphic rodent since Caddyshack. Whats left for Eddie Murphy? Snappy as he is playing the Klumps Id hate to see him reduced to a trash-talking humanoid doll. He could probably go on grinding out mediocre hits but his most creative opportunity might be to get back to stand-up comedy and come clean once again with his audience about fame gossip growing older. He cant hide inside a latex bodysuit forever. B- Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories Harry Potter and the Cursed Child Go inside the opening gala J.K.

Comedy. Starring Eddie Murphy and Janet Jackson. (Rated PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Eddie Murphy does not play Janet Jackson in ""Nutty Professor II The Klumps."" He plays everybody else. In this sequel to the 1996 hit the five members of the Klump family finally push away from the dinner table -- the only place they were seen the last time around -- Buddy Love is still cackling just under the surface and Murphy materializes in even more disguises than expected. The results are frequently hilarious. He is first seen as Mama Klump a beaming member of a gospel choir singing ""Oh Happy Day"" for a wedding but the real action begins with a knockout sight gag. What an entrance Roly-poly Professor Sherman Klump actually more sweet-natured than nutty has discovered the secret of the fountain of youth bottled it and is about to sell it to a pharmaceutical conglomerate for 150 million approximately what this movie will make at the box office in a week or two. If you can buy Jackson as a fellow professor and -- in an inspired bit of casting --a very proper one at that youre not alone. Sherman longs to marry her but his libidinous alter ego Buddy Love keeps popping up. What this comic fable ultimately comes to is learning to accept oneself whole unconscious sex drive and all -- id is just ID without the capitals you know. In what could be one nut- scientist plot twist too many but absolutely necessary nevertheless Sherman has made another discovery in his Rube Goldberg-meets-Dr. Frankenstein lab how to isolate the DNA for his Buddy Love gene and rid himself of the pesky troublemaker. This not only frees his inner id but frees Murphy himself to run wild. Its probably too much to ask for a little restraint where gross-out comedy is concerned -- maybe he goes too far -- but whos complaining? The Eddie Murphy weve all been waiting for is back loose and unfettered. He hasnt been this freewheeling since his notorious 1982 concert album. Even with all the variations on Viagra jokes you wonder if he can keep it up for 110 minutes. By and large in this longish comedy he does. As Sherman Mama and the other Klumps -- including the randy Granny dim brother Ernie and Papa who after 35 years on the job has been fired not retired -- Murphy is variously prickly coy wistful bitchy touchy prissy giddy and pugnacious and thats just for starters. Add Buddy to the mix and youve got satanic and lecherous as a sniffing mongrel. One-upping Murphys first ""Nutty Professor"" -- Jerry Lewis was the original never forget -- the Klumps now can interact in the same frame thanks to digital effects and not just look over one anothers shoulder. Stand-up comedian Larry Miller is so good as Shermans dean that he steals scenes from Murphy. Periodically Shermans fantasies are dropped in too almost as stand- alone skits. As a practical matter -- whos practical at a time like this? -- they could be cut but it would mean the loss of parodies of ""Armageddon"" and ""Star Wars."" ""May the Force be with you"" will never be the same. In other contexts a laboratory hamster evolves into a humping parody of ""Godzilla"" and wicked little zingers are sent flying in the direction of Richard Simmons and especially Stone Phillips of NBC.

"Nutty Professor 2 The Klumps | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; nutty-professor-2-the-klumps ) Nutty Professor 2 The Klumps (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Eddie Murphys 1996 remake of The Nutty Professor is one of those movies that at least from a creative perspective neither deserves nor warrants a sequel. Whats the point? More of the same it seems. Any time a movie makes 130 million in the U.S. and nearly 250 million worldwide and the potential however thin for a second installment exists the film will be made. So the existence of Nutty Professor II The Klumps is a purely economic endeavor a workmanlike deal for which journeyman comedy director Peter Segal (Naked Gun 33 1/3 My Fellow Americans) was hired. And from the opening credits it looks and feels that way. The problem certainly isnt Eddie Murphy who with the aid of Hollywood makeup man extraordinary Rick Baker gives the part his all turning in no fewer than seven characters only one of which doesnt require padding and latex. Murphys versatility is much in evidence here. In addition to the gentle meek lead character Professor Sherman Klump he plays four other family members Shermans genteel mother gruff father clueless brother and randy grandmother. As if that wasnt enough he also portrays Shermans hound-dog alter ego Buddy Love as well as a younger version of Papa Klump. There are times when Murphys whirlwind energetic approach almost saves Nutty Professor II. Its interesting to look at the trajectory of Murphys career. After starting out in the mid-70s on Saturday Night Live he moved to the big screen where he quickly became an action/comedy box-office draw. In some quarters Murphy was known as much for his profanity as for his toothy smile and the controversial release of 1987s Eddie Murphy Raw did nothing to dispel this reputation. A little more than a decade later however Murphy has re-made his image into that of a family-friendly comedian. With roles in two Nutty Professor movies one Dr. Dolittle and a speaking part in Dinseys animated Mulan Murphy has widened his audience considerably. Its fair to question whether Nutty Professor II deserves its ""PG-13"" rating. It is raunchy enough that an ""R"" wouldnt have been out-of-the-question. A significant portion of the jokes are related to either flatulence or sex and theres a scene with a little kid spouting profanity (voice dubbed by Murphy) and doing more than ogle a pair of bra-clad breasts. To be fair this is just the kind of lowbrow humor that will have junior high and high school students rolling in the aisles since the 11-16 year-old crowd finds this sort of stuff funnier than the rest of us. Thats not to say that Nutty Professor II doesnt offer any laughs for a more mature audience. The scenes of Murphy imitating a half-man/half-dog are a riot as are some of the barbed one-liners he tosses out. Theres also an inspired dream sequence that lampoons three science fiction features Star Wars (using John Williams music - that couldnt have come cheap) Armageddon and 2001. But to be frank how many times can a fart joke be amusing? Havent we seen that variety of comedy often enough? And once weve giggled at Grandmas frank sex talk a time or two isnt it like beating a dead horse? Murphy is a gifted comic actor; he deserves better material than this. It might have helped if Nutty Professor II was founded on the semblance of a coherent storyline but this plot is too silly and preposterous even for this kind of cotton candy production. It features the return of Sherman Klump the gentle giant genius who has learned that its better to be fat and kind than skinny and crass. Sherman is in love with a fellow professor at Wellman College the attractive Denise Gains (Janet Jackson). After much hemming and hawing he asks her to marry him in one of the most unique proposal sequences (featuring an army of fireflies) in recent motion picture history. She accepts and the entire Klump clan is delighted. But trouble in the form of Buddy Love is lurking just beneath Shermans exterior. And when the professor believes that his nasty alter-ego could be a danger to his impending marriage he decides to have the ""Buddy"" gene extracted from his DNA. Diaster ensues. Not only does the result cause Sherman to slowly lose his intelligence but Buddy uses host material from a dog to reconstitute himself. His price for extracting himself from Shermans life a youth serum that a pharmaceutical company is willing to pay 150 million for. Nutty Professor II isnt quite long enough to be tedious but there are stretches when it tries ones patience. Crisper editing probably would have helped but the filmmakers apparently were reluctant to lose a single frame of Murphy in makeup. The movie also attempts to have a human semi-dramatic side (Sherman learning to respect himself and his girlfriend; Mom and Pop rekindling their love after all these years) but the saccharine component comes across as cloying not pleasant. The screenplay (co-written by brothers Chris amp; Paul Weitz who are currently on display as actors in Chuck amp; Buck) is in desperate need of an overhaul. And what does it say about a film when the biggest laughs occur during the end credit outtakes? For a movie that probably never should have been made the best part arrives once The End is past.
