Pics one-dimensionality is paradoxically exposed by the mediums inherent realism. Charged sexual elements and tony pedigree will combine for sharp B.O. in more sophisticated upscale situations. The caustic wit and brute force of Patrick Marbers acclaimed play come across with a softened edge in Mike Nichols bigscreen version of ""Closer."" Intriguing as a companion piece to the directors early-career studies of the sexual battleground ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and especially ""Carnal Knowledge"" pics one-dimensionality is paradoxically exposed by the mediums inherent realism with its close-ups and real locations. Although the female roles are not ideally cast powerhouse star lineup charged sexual elements and tony pedigree will combine for sharp B.O. in more sophisticated upscale situations but much less so in the boonies. Marbers second play which won the Olivier Award as the best of 1997 in the U.K. is the sort of work London legit critics describe as ""searing"" ""scorching"" and ""withering."" Ingeniously structured piece jigsaws together four years in the lives of four beautiful young people whose talent for attracting one another is surpassed only by their need to indelibly scar those they purport to love. First comes the catnip of the seduction dance. Waify American vagabond Alice (Natalie Portman) is rescued after a London traffic accident by local journo Dan (Jude Law) and her frisky ways even in the hospital enchant him. Some time later Dan getting photographed for his authors portrait by another Yank Anna (Julie Roberts) puts the make on her while admitting he lives with Alice; the latter visiting after the session instantly senses the sexual vibes that have recently filled the studio. Films most explicit interlude reprises the scene that became an instant classic in the stage version which Marber himself directed. Hooking up with Larry (Clive Owen) a successful dermatologist on an Internet sex chat site Dan proves himself adept at one kind of writing (his novel fails) when he is role-playing pretending to be a woman. He provokes Larry into a frenzy of cyberspatial desire by promising a rendezvous with an ""Anna"" the next day at the aquarium. Lo and behold Anna herself turns up and she and the ruggedly attractive Larry soon are on a quick path to amour. Uninterested in the quotidian of long-term relationships Marber keenly delineates the beginnings of lust and the turning points that signal the end. As readily as the characters articulate their desire they also volunteer usually in the most brutal terms their changes of heart; through unvarnished honesty they can be sure to generate a full charge of hate. Inclined to confrontation and compulsively pushing matters to beyond the brink Larry in the films strongest scene ferociously forces Anna to reveal not only that she had a year-long affair with Dan but the most explicit details of their sex life all the better to masochistically absorb the full bitterness of her betrayal and tell her what she can do with herself. Having been kicked out by Dan and working in a sex club Alice is encountered by Larry who in another potent scene desperately begs the scantily clad girl for intimacy only to be rejected with polite professionalism. In the end Larry uses his penchant for unrestrained truth-telling to manipulate the seemingly happy Dan and Anna leading to a finale that wrings a twist on the more dire outcome of the play. Piece is structured with subtly deceptive skill. No device signals the sometimes significant chronological jumps (flashbacks pop up as well) but the time frames are soon enough indicated in dialogue and the intense compression of the work (which ran well over two hours onstage) leaves nary a word or image wasted. A lifelong master not only of the stage but of artfully transferring stage material to the screen as last proven by ""Angels in America"" Nichols keeps his finger on the texts corrosive pulse while decking out the action in clean chilly visuals. But whereas the plays narrow focus was arguably disguised and bolstered by highly stylized staging its more naturalistic presentation onscreen reveals its artificiality. Like dramas by Pinter and others what seems trenchant and perfectly pitched in the theater can come off as arch even when skillfully transferred to film. The male side of the equation is very capably handled by Owen and Law. Owen who played Dan in the original National Theater production dominates the film with a crafty stinging performance as Larry that induces him to show more vibrant colors and more shading than he has onscreen before. Law is in top form as the emotionally quicksilver Dan and the two men share a potent scene late in the game in which Larry describes the lay of the land to Dan in no uncertain terms. Roberts and Portman their characters changed from Brits to Americans to little textual effect deliver up to their abilities but in neither case does one feel the roles are being maximized. Roberts especially is the weak link of the four coming off as wan and under-energized compared with the others and creating a less-knowing and articulate character than Natasha Richardson did in New York. In her first fully adult role in every sense of the word Portman jumps into the deep end emotively and physically and makes good connections with both Alices tough and vulnerable sides. But she seems still too girly for the role and cannot put sex or sensuality across with conviction. By contrast Anna Friel was stunningly hot and revelatory in the role on Broadway and its a shame this too-little-seen actress wasnt given the chance to raise the films temperature. Stephen Goldblatts sleek and immaculate lensing employs a gray-looking London as backdrop to the volatile words and emotions and mostly classical source music is deftly used.

Dan (Jude Law) a jobbing obituaries writer falls in love with Alice (Natalie Portman) a spunky young American living in London and moves in with her. A year or two later Dan falls for Anna (Julia Roberts) an attractive photographer but accidentally introduces her to Larry (Clive Owen) a foul-mouthed macho dermatologist via an internet dating site. Still Dan eventually snags Anna while a cuckolded Larry bags a steamy night with Alice before Dan finally wins Alice back after tracking her down to a city strip joint...The threat of narrative vertigo aside it took a second viewing before I could warm to Patrick Marbers adaptation of his own mid-90s stageplay. Initially its impossible to overcome just how cold these characters are - four slick young adults caught in a destructive cycle of stop-start inter-connecting relationships. Furthermore Marber piles on the alienation by showing us only the beginning and the end of these aborted pairings. Its a trick that strengthens Marbers assertion that love can be nasty brutish and short but leaves us with too many questions begging about his characters personalities and relationships like Who the hell are they?That aside Owen and Portman give excellent committed performances leaving Law and Roberts in the shade. The writing is uneven (and feels dated at points) but two scenes of break-ups in particular are superbly penned and performed not least when Owen bitterly quizzes Roberts as to the details of her extra-marital affair spitting out the million-dollar question Did you come?At its worst its hollow plot feels like the dreadful recent TV series NY-LON. At its best its script bears an alluring cruelty that is all too credible.

Portman and Owens are indeed good here however ever Owens character is still a bit too creepy to want to spend time with and its just a little weird hearing such foul things from Portman - not because I can only buy her as a sweet girl/woman but because shes such an incredible actress that shes never needed to resort to being foul to put forth a characters bitterness.

One pair of the storys heterosexual London quartet--a dermatologist named Larry (Clive Owen) and the divorced photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) meet because Larry thinks she has summoned him to a rendezvous after a salacious chat. In fact Larry was chatting with Dan (Jude Law) an obituary writer and failed novelist posing online as Anna whom he lusts after even though hes living with the waifish waitress/stripper Alice (Natalie Portman). This is but the first of the dirty tricks the men play on each other in this nastily funny erotic roundelay. As the four ardent duplicitous characters keep changing partners it becomes clear that when push comes to shove male competitiveness trumps romantic desire. Dan and Larry are straight but theyre more obsessed with f---ing with each others minds than f---ing the women they think they love.Nichols has traversed this territory before in his film of Edward Albees ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and in his coolly savage ""Carnal Knowledge."" Marbers play has been highly acclaimed but its not in the same league with those movies his characters seem more like puppets on the authors string than actual people and his insights into sexual gamesmanship are hardly new. Yet with a cast this good and a director this knowing ""Closer"" has many moments of mordant power. Portman as the most open and vulnerable of the quartet--this is her first real adult role--is truly poignant.

Closer Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/closer-2004,200,closer6,closer,rogerebert
"Closer | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; closer ) Closer (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli If you pay attention to Hollywoods romantic comedies the interaction between men and women is all about love and companionship. If you instead rely upon the philosophy of Closer its all about power. Closer starts like a nice romantic drama with a couple of ""meet cutes"" (as Roger Ebert calls them) then does a 180-degree turn and shows what happens when happily ever after rots from the inside out. It isnt just the relationships that curdle but the characters. Their interaction becomes bitter and cynical. Sex is a tool used in power struggles and one-upsmanship games. Although the word ""love"" is mentioned a few times it has little place in this movie where emotions are weaknesses to be exploited by others. With Closer director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Patrick Marber (translating his stage play) have ventured into Neil LaBute territory (In the Company of Men Your Friends and Neighbors). For Nichols this is not new terrain - he has visited here twice previously in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and Carnal Knowledge. Put those two older films together with Closer and you get a grim trilogy that doesnt have a lot of good things to say about the human condition. On the surface Closer is the story of two couples whose infidelities rip them apart. Dan (Jude Law) and Alice (Natalie Portman) meet on the streets of London when she is hit by a car and he comes to her rescue. He takes her to a hospital and the pair are soon living together. But Dan an obituary writer who has penned a novel finds himself obsessed with Anna (Julia Roberts) a photographer who takes the picture for his book jacket. He wants her and tells her so but she demurs when she learns he has a live-in girlfriend. ""Youre taken"" she comments as if that puts an end to things. Dan inadvertently introduces Larry (Clive Owen) to Anna when a practical joke (in which he pretends to be Anna in an Internet sex chat room) goes awry. The two start a romance and are eventually married. But theres sexual chemistry between Dan and Anna and to a lesser extent between Larry and Alice. Over the next four years (the film occasionally jumps forward by months in order to span that much time) infidelities occur betrayals are discovered and all manner of ugliness ensues. From a physical standpoint Closer is not a violent film. From an emotional one its brutal. Nichols doesnt pull his punches. You leave the theater shaken. The film is notable for its frank dialogue. Theres plenty of profanity and also a host of interesting observations. (Although these characters speak with an erudition not found in conversations between real people.) Closer is talky but in a smart way. You never feel that the characters are talking to hear their own words or to fill up screen time. Nevertheless those unaware that the story began its life as a play will not be surprised to learn this fact. Yet the rawness of emotions keeps us from noticing how few sets there are and how little conventional ""action"" occurs. The film turns the tables on just about everyone. Users become victims and vice versa. Innocence is corrupted and corruption learns too late that theres no return path. Alice who is arguably the most naA-ve member of the ensemble (despite being a stripper by profession) is hurt the most deeply and that pain results in an irrevocable change. Larry a decent guy when the film starts turns into a cold calculating man having sex on at least two occasions to torment Dan. In the end he wants to possess Anna not out of love but because doing so means beating Dan. But to paint Dan as guiltless is unfair - hes a weasel (albeit a charming one) and an instigator. He cheats without concern for repercussions then is astounded when any of them impact him. Anna is fundamentally weak and dishonest. She doles out and receives hurt in equal measures. In Closer the actors get a chance to shine and no one is brighter than Clive Owen. Despite a number of memorable turns (and one big mistake King Arthur) Owen still lacks household recognition. A likely (and deserved) Oscar nomination for this performance will change that. The ferocity with which Owen delivers his lines and the restless energy he imparts to Larry electrifies every scene that hes in. Closers two most riveting sequences involve Owen and Natalie Portman - one in an art gallery where they first meet and the other in a strip club where he has all the money but she has the power and uses it. Portman in what has been called her first truly adult role (its certainly nowhere close to Queen Amidala) is also very very good. Like Owen she must essay a character who undergoes a complete personality transformation - from vulnerable waif to ice queen seductress. Theres a rawness and courage to her work (and although theres no overt physical nudity due to camera placement her scenes in the strip club are frank). The aforementioned scenes are Portmans highlights as well as Owens and she has one other - a heartbreaking moment in which she turns to the camera with tears on her face and we recognize that the first piece of Alices innocence has been stolen. It would be unfair to describe either Julia Roberts or Jude Laws performances as ""lesser"" but the two high-profile actors are not on the same level as their compatriots. Each has their moments but neither captures the attention of the camera with the intensity of Owen or Portman. This is Roberts the actress not Roberts the movie star (see Oceans Twelve if youre craving for the latter) and her dedication to the role rather than glamour serves her well. Law is a little flat; I actually found him more convincing in Alfie. Movies that look deeply into the human soul and uncover putrefaction are hard sells. But they are also some of the most fascinating films to be found. Are Nichols and Marbers characters too cynically drawn? Perhaps. Do they occasionally seem like marionettes manipulated by a clever writer? Yes. But those things dont diminish the films compelling emotional qualities. Closer is powerful and disturbing stuff. It is not life-affirming and its not for those who want to leave a movie theater uplifted and convinced that fairy tale endings can happen. And this is most definitely not a date movie. But if you appreciate films that are more substance than style that take challenges and dont follow formulas and that feature Oscar-caliber performances Closer is not to be missed.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Directed by Mike Nichols from Patrick Marbers play its the story of Anna and Dan and Larry and Alice -- and of what happens when lovers realize that what they thought was intimacy and contentment was actually built on lies. ""Whats so great about the truth?"" one character asks bitterly late in the film understanding too late that truth here means betrayal. Nichols whos been exploring the dark divide between men and women (and love and sex) since ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" and ""Carnal Knowledge"" does near-miraculous work here. He draws out the play from its stage confines and helps four A-list actors transcend their own beauty to find the beating often-cold hearts of their characters. Julia Roberts most notably has never been better. Natalie Portman who can be wooden with the wrong director (see the recent ""Star Wars"" movies) is startlingly vivid here. And Jude Law and Clive Owen are meticulously controlled with chilly smiles and heart-wrenching howls of pain. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""Closer"" with Julia Roberts Jude Law Natalie Portman Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols from a screenplay by Patrick Marber based on the play by Marber. 98 minutes. Rated R for sequences of graphic sexual dialogue nudity/sexuality and language. Several theaters. The film unfolds as a handful of set pieces each separated by time (how much were not told; Nichols and Marber respect their audience too much to spell everything out). Dan (Law) an obituary writer and Alice (Portman) a young drifter meet on a London street and you see the initial spark She gently takes off his glasses and wipes a smudge; he introducing himself does a courtly little bow. Zoom ahead and hes a novelist having his picture taken by photographer Anna (Roberts). Zoom ahead more and Annas met Larry (Owen) blink and the partners are switched not very happily. ""This will hurt"" says Dan preparing to tell Alice about Anna -- as Larry a doctor might warn a patient of a needles sting. There are moments when ""Closer"" betrays its stage origins; occasionally the dialogue becomes clipped and unnatural in a way that we might accept on a stage but not in the more realistic setting of a film. But its written and filmed with great intelligence and performed fearlessly. As the actors pair and re-pair each scene becomes a tour de force a wittily filmed online sex scene between Larry (as himself) and Dan (whos pretending hes Anna); a dimly lit evening in Dan and Annas flat when he learns that she has lied. Roberts seeming to visibly shrink inside her drab clothing (its as if shes in armor for the evening) casts off her usual unruffled onscreen quality; shes raw and aching all glamour gone. ""Closer"" with its to-the-bone emotions isnt for everyone; it could perhaps be fairly described in the words Alice uses to describe Annas work ""a bunch of sad strangers photographed beautifully."" But like another two-couple story of betrayal from earlier this year ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" Nichols film turns pain into art. Nobody in this film seems to know what they want; they keep asking questions that shouldnt be asked and shouldnt be answered. Devastated by Annas announcement of her infidelity Larry fires a series of questions at her probing the details as if stabbing his own heart with a pin. ""Did you ever love me?"" he finally asks. ""Yes"" she says in a tiny voice but the tragedy is that it doesnt matter anymore.

Starring Julia Roberts Jude Law Natalie Portman and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The truest thing that can be said about ""Closer"" is that Julia Roberts nearly tanks it. Partly its a matter of an actress having the wrong essence for a role. Partly its a case of her making ungenerous safe and misguided acting choices. Either way whenever Roberts is onscreen ""Closer"" freezes and starts to atrophy. And when shes off tender shoots of life begin to sprout. The other three principals -- Natalie Portman Jude Law and Clive Owen -- are superb. In the case of Portman and Owen not only have they never been better but theyve never been so revealed and compelling. Their forceful work actually inspires viewing strategies like watching Roberts while imagining the same scenes but with another actress. Still with the energy constantly dropping down to zero its impossible to imagine what ""Closer"" might have been except the thing it is A collection of two-person encounters some hit and some miss all dealing with some aspect of sex lust or betrayal. Based on the play by Patrick Marber and directed by none other than Mike Nichols (""The Graduate"" ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"") the movie follows the romantic intersections as it were of four people in London over the course of several years. Law is Dan a young English journalist and Portman is Alice a former stripper from America. They meet when she is hit by a London taxi a risk all Americans take in a country where everyone drives on the wrong side of the road. Alice is impulsive and life-loving very young but old enough to have a past while Dan is already disappointed with himself an obituary writer who once had artistic aspirations. The film takes a kind of time-lapse photography strategy in its story telling skipping over entire months and years to check in with characters and their progress. So when next we meet Dan he is being photographed in connection with a forthcoming novel which he based on his girlfriend Alices life. Roberts plays the photographer Anna and shes believable in the sense that its possible Roberts could take someones picture. But that she would be charmed enough by Dan to abandon herself and start kissing him is something else entirely. Roberts cant even abandon herself to the acting moment. She plays Anna as closed off guarded and mildly unpleasant. Roberts only comfort zone is anger -- ""Men are crap"" -- but the role calls for sensuality. Alas when Roberts and Law kiss after doing that melodramatic lip-hovering that you often see in movies the impulse is to laugh. No one has ever described Roberts as anything but an attractive woman. So it says something about the sourness she brings to Anna that its difficult to imagine any man wanting anything to do with her much less a fellow who looks like Jude Law much less one whos going out with Natalie Portman. Actually if Dan were just released from a federal penitentiary it would still be difficult to imagine. At this point ""Closer"" needs an injection of energy and it comes in the form of Clive Owen as Larry an English dermatologist who has an animal-like ruthlessness about him. Larry is the most interesting character in the film -- the shrewdest the most loving the most dangerous the most perverse -- and Owen runs with it. Next to Owen Law looks like a lightweight. Thats OK. Law plays a lightweight. Portman almost steals the show. She would have if Alice were in more scenes and if the screenwriter understood her better. In a sense Alice is a sketch of a character but Portman fills her out with her live intelligent eyes and with a smile that suggests more than mischief maybe trouble. Portman also goes beyond charm in an excruciating break-up scene and she carries off a potentially embarrassing strip club scene with admirable self-possession. In their scenes together she matches Owen tops him and makes him top himself. This is the joy of working with real actors under the guidance of a first-rate director. Unfortunately most of ""Closer"" revolves around the sexual obsession of the two men for Anna the photographer played by Roberts. From the script the impression is left that Anna is impulsive highly sexed and afraid to hurt peoples feelings. That would have meant Roberts playing against type and she doesnt even try. If you see the movie notice how she plays her scenes with Law and Owen. The men seem to be generating their performances out of thin air resigned to getting nothing from Roberts. It sometimes feels as if theyre playing scenes by themselves. ""Closer"" has clever dialogue and scenes that are alive to all the treachery and nuance of sexual intrigue. But its like a four-cylinder car with one dead cylinder. Well never know how far it might have gone. -- Advisory Strong language nudity sexual situations and lewd talk.

"Love Knot washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Love Knot Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 3 2004 When the old relationship heads south nothing hurts more. So why is ""Closer"" about four people who spend two hours setting speed records as they frickin sprint south so much fun? The answer is that although none of the characters is noble or heroic or selfless or particularly disciplined all are bright clever ironic self-aware. They say -- well actually screenwriter Patrick Marber as abetted by director Mike Nichols says -- smart things funny things clever things ugly things self-delusional things but always amusing things. If youre the sort of person who laughs at funerals train wrecks earnest political documentaries and stories about the rape of nature youll love ""Closer."" Its a kind of round-robin of sexual opportunism shattered loyalties and frank talk all in a key of mordant irony as driven by quips so lashing and perfect that only a true misanthrope could come up with them. Oscar Wilde meet Edward Albee and Larry David; thats what it feels like. In this corner is Dan (Jude Law) obit writer novelist and casually handsome popinjay-about-town. In that corner is Alice (Natalie Portman) waif stripper random particle sexual healer neediest case. In still another corner is Anna (Julia Roberts) artsy photographer lonely mid-thirties beauty empty success whose arch photos document the spiritual emptiness of most lives. And in the fourth corner is Larry (Clive Owen) dermatologist Internet lurker sailor on perpetual three-day liberty guilty party and passionate lover. Marber who also wrote the play the film is based upon isnt exactly interested in realism. He has a lot of trouble conjuring ways to get his folks together and falls too easily into an old-movie trope called the ""cute meet."" By contrast in another recent study of adultery among a gang of four ""We Dont Live Here Anymore"" director John Curran had the advantage of a single setting (a liberal arts college) and a single department (creative writing) which kept all the naughty ducks in a row. Here the place is London and the ducks are all over the damned place. I didnt believe for example the method by which Larry and Anna hook up. Hes reeled into the situation by Dan posing as a woman in an Internet chat room. Dan talking dirty in cyberspace induces poor horn dog Larry into a tryst at an aquarium where he knows Anna will be (he is mad at Anna for rejecting him). Larry shows up and announces to Anna that hes you know the guy from Lets-do-it-now.com who was interested in -------- followed by -------- with ------- as an encore. Hmm is there a woman on this Earth who so approached wouldnt run to the nearest cop or pull out either her Mace or her .44 special? Robertss Anna decides to date him. The meeting between Dan and Alice is less preposterous but more unlikely. She -- an American new to London -- looks left instead of right while stepping into the street and is knocked skyward by a taxi. But shes just -- movie cliche -- ""knocked out"" and comes to in Dans (Jude Laws) arms; he was fortuitously walking by. Hmm I think you could get hit by a thousand London cabs and assuming you survived 20 or so of the collisions youd run into a beautiful creature like Jude Law about never. But thats really a small thing. The big thing is the randomness of impulse and their utter inability to control it. If once argued that the heart is a foul rag and bone shop Marber and Nichols counter that its a rabbit hutch during the rut. Everybodys doing it doing it doing it. Dan already with Alice comes on to Anna and is turned down. Some months later after shes with Larry Dan comes on again and Anna says ""yes."" Meanwhile Larry is sporting with prostitutes in New York and when Anna leaves him for Dan he looks up Alice (dumped by Dan for Anna) in a strip club. Nichols leaves ambiguous what happens to them. But then Larry tries desperately to get Anna back and at a certain point Dan tries desperately to get Alice back. The hormonal pull in this movie may loosen your fillings. Photographed brilliantly by old pro Stephen Goldblatt its full of chilly scenes in the London winter a sense of cold blue light puffs of breath and slush on the streets. Possibly its the briskness that keeps driving these people into each others beds. But the movie -- though old-fashioned in its materials as it posits love under all the sex -- is edgily postmodernist in its execution. For one thing its like a Jules Feiffer cartoon (Nichols remember did a similar picture ""Carnal Knowledge"" from a Feiffer script) in that the four are pretty much alone in the world their relationships filling every nook and cranny of the universe. Its like theyre talking heads in Feiffers Village Voice comic strip circa1963; wheres schlumphy Bernard Mergendeiler when you need him? After Feiffer their working lives are barely sketched society is barely noted. They have no politics no hobbies no eccentricities; they are their sex lives nothing more nothing less. Nichols has fun with chronology too. He keeps spurting ahead in time but were never quite sure where we are in a new scene until we realize halfway through that its not the next hour its the next year. But hell also spurt backward in time -- the overall implication being that in love and sex there is no time -- so youre always guessing. He holds off on cues to temporal location so youre on your toes seeking clues finally fitting the pieces together. Its a bracingly adult way to tell a story and it presumes a certain level of intelligence and attention from a movie-savvy audience. Then theres beauty. Lord these kids are lookers and Im talking about the guys The women Has Julia Roberts ever looked more beautiful yet more tragic? (Cate Blanchett was to play this role when pregnancy interrupted. With her it would have been a different less good film; Blanchett is too intellectual for the emotion-driven Anna.) Goldblatt lights Roberts from above in serene glow -- shes like a kabuki mask solemn almost ceremonial signifying the seriousness of wounds delivered in matrimonial combat. As for the elfin Portman its far and away the best performance of the adult portion of her career. Gone is that kid-genius preciousness; she seems like someone abused by men and self almost to the breaking point. ""Closer"" as a title tells only half the story that the movie does. Its about getting closer but the hurting part is about getting farther. Closer (103 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extremely brutal sexual language and sexual innuendo and some nudity.

(CNN) -- Much of the dialogue in ""Closer"" written by Patrick Marber and directed by Mike Nichols is as pointed cold and sharp as an icicle. Yet it melts in the mouths of the films four stars. Julia Roberts Jude Law Clive Owen and Natalie Portman all give stunning performances in this film based on Marbers award-winning play. But Portman and Owen could be arrested for grand theft since they manage to steal the film out from under their heavyweight co-stars.But its Roberts and Law who are being pushed by Columbia Pictures as best actor and actress nominees while Portman and Owen are being touted in the supporting categories.""Closer"" is an acerbic story that intertwines the lives of two couples engaging in an ever-shifting emotional dance as they meet fall in love and then fall out of love. In the process all four manage to switch back and forth from one twosome to another. Theyre actually playing a dangerous game of Russian roulette using love as a bullet.The situation soon turns into a brutal competition between the two men over the women in their lives.""Closer"" makes no moral judgments about its characters behavior and is decidedly adult in its tone and subject matter. Its overriding theme is about love -- obtaining it and losing it and how fragile it can be. The film is also very human with equal amounts of hostility and vulgarity.But what better director than Nichols -- the man who brought us ""Carnal Knowledge"" and ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" -- to explore the dark recesses of the human heart? Unfortunately despite Nichols great record at adapting plays to film -- ""Wit"" and ""Angels in America"" -- ""Closer"" never completely loses its feeling of being a stage production.The story jumps forward through huge time gaps and a great deal of the action takes place off-screen allowing viewers to see only the characters reaction to events not the events themselves. Then add the language which while beautifully delivered seems too perfect -- almost artificial -- and the result is a production that feels stagey at times. Natalie Portman and Clive OwenPortman is breathtaking in her most adult role yet. In her hands Alice goes from a neurotic waif to a sexually charged stripper in the beat of a heart. As she matures Portmans beauty -- and talent -- is becoming almost translucent. And her scene where shes wearing nothing but a small bra and a G-string will stop many mens hearts.Roberts -- who got the part only after Cate Blanchett became pregnant -- does a great dramatic turn as Anna. On the whole none of these roles are particularly sympathetic but Roberts manages to wring out a bit of empathy for her character despite Annas blatant bed hopping. This is her best role since ""Erin Brockovich"" where she also stepped way out of her usual comfort zone.Law continues his roll of great performances. This man is becoming a major star with a capital S. But its Owen who has the stronger character and gives the most compelling performance. Owen was actually in the original stage production in London and played Laws role. Now as Larry hes had the opportunity to see the material from both perspectives and he gives a strong deeply rooted performance. The scene where he breaks up with Anna will nail you to your seat.The music by Irish singer/songwriter Damien Rice is brilliant. His song ""The Blowers Daughter"" opens and closes the film and completely captures the tone of the story. Its worthy of an Academy Award nomination.Overall despite the lingering feeling of being adapted from the stage ""Closer"" is a haunting production that may linger in your mind long after you leave the theater. It has a lot to say about the human condition and what were willing to go through in order to find and keep love.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

And it also can make us want to avert our eyes and guard our hearts. But that is in some ways its intent. (Related video Watch a preview of Closer) Dan (Jude Law) and Anna (Julia Roberts) become lovers in Mike Nichols film about love sex and betrayal in London. Columbia Pictures Based on an acclaimed play by Patrick Marber Closer scrutinizes the love lives of four people whose paths intersect. The movies best scene is its spellbinding opening sequence in which a man and woman (Jude Law and Natalie Portman) spot each other on a crowded London street and lock eyes. A hauntingly emotional song --The Blowers Daughter by Damien Rice with lyrics that sound as if they were written expressly for the movie -- provides the perfect musical expression of the intensity of their gaze. The repetition of the line ""I cant take my eyes off of you"" could sum up the obsessive fascination people have when they first meet. The song also relays the sense of jealousy and paranoia that can set in as things fall apart as if the lyrics were to continue ""I cant take my eyes off you for one second or youll betray me."" About the movie Closer   1/ 2 (out of four) Stars Julia Roberts Jude Law Clive Owen Natalie Portman Directors Mike Nichols Distributor Sony Pictures Rated R for graphic sexual dialogue nudity/sexuality and language Opens Friday in selected cities Closer plays tricks with time in a way that initially might confuse but quickly grows clear. After Law and Portman send off sparks they spar verbally. The next scene takes place about a year later. Law and Portman are a seemingly content couple and Law has written a book about Portmans prior sexual adventures. But an instant attraction is sparked between him and a divorced character (played by Julia Roberts) while she photographs him. When that attraction plays itself out it ruins not only Laws relationship with Portman but also Roberts subsequent marriage to a doctor (Clive Owen). The theatrical dialogue is at its best when it cuts to the quick in its saber-like honesty. ""Whats so great about the truth?"" one character asks. ""Try lying once in a while. Its the currency of the world."" But sometimes the plot turns feel contrived and the dialogue sounds forced. ""Dont stop loving me. I can see it draining out of you"" one character pleads. Do people really talk like that? And do they profess to undying love then turn on a dime minutes later and say theyve just fallen out of love? For most people the process is more gradual. Still it makes for high drama which is what Closer is all about. There is humor in Closer but the movies sequences of sweet beginnings are obscured by all the brutal endings. Male sexual jealousy is a prominent theme that plays itself out in a powerfully cruel scene between Owen and Law. All the actors do fine work but Owens quixotic and brooding quality is particularly effective here. Closer offers a bleak though thought-provoking take on relationships. The challenge for the viewer is in caring enough to become invested in characters who seem hellbent on hurting one another.

"Closer Talk dirty to me. Slate Sign In Sign Up Closer Talk dirty to me. Closer Talk dirty to me. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 2 2004 717 PM Talk Dirty to Me See Natalie Portman curse in Closer. By David Edelstein Beautiful people behaving badly Mike Nichols film of Closer (Columbia Pictures) is being hailed as an event for putting sex front and center even though its the sort of movie that makes you think twice about having it--or at least given the inevitability of betrayal risking intimacy. Its the perfect sex picture for an increasingly puritanical culture. It doesnt have any The undressing is all psychological and the deeper the emotion the tighter and hungrier Nichols close-ups. The septuagenarian director of Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Carnal Knowledge and other fashionably cynical portraits of heterosexual nastiness has recovered his killer instincts. Chalk up another one for Viagra. Adapted--faithfully I suspect--by Patrick Marber from his own play Closer is a sort of hermetically sealed chamber drama in which four strangers (the only people in the movie essentially) play musical beds. In the beginning buttoned-up obituary writer Dan (Jude Law) locks eyes with punky magenta-haired sexpot Alice (Natalie Portman) on a London street. Then boom She gets smashed by a car. They chat and flirt in the hospital waiting room then on a bus then in front of Dans workplace--and you can tell this is an ""opened-up"" play because the conversation is fluid even though the settings keep shifting. Advertisement Theres a jump in time and Dan is having his book-jacket photo taken for a novel about Alice with whom he has been living. But the photographer is Anna and Anna is Julia Roberts; and after some arch banter and some more psychological undressing the two end up with their tongues down each others throats. Thats when Portmans Alice shows up and things get a mite uncomfortable. Dan is so frustrated by his (apparently unrequited) love for Anna that he goes on the Internet pretends to be her and has cyber-sex with horny dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen). Then he directs Larry to the real Annas favorite spot the aquarium where Larry finds her and to her dismay purrs sweet obscenities into her ear. I have to confess I love it when big movie stars talk dirty. Their images are so sanitized and besides they cant say anything naughty on television or the FCC will stomp all over them. And its not like theres much sex talk in mainstream American movies. Audiences are comfortable with four-letter words hurled in anger in the course of hideously violent acts but used to express love or desire theyre a little uh icky and they also threaten our moral values. Thats why its fun to hear Clive Owen interrogate Julia Roberts about how she fellated Jude Law or see Owen being straddled by Star Wars icy princess Portman in a G-string spewing four-letter anatomical references. What a happy voyeur am I. Closer is about how these people bond and then need for some perverse but deeply human reason to test those bonds which is a terrible idea. Its not an accident that a key disastrous conversation occurs in an opera house playing Cosi Fan Tutte Mozarts bitter farce of two men testing their fiancees fidelity. Im not going to spoil the movie by telling you who ends up with whom but its worth pointing out that the two characters who at first appear to be victimized end up as victors. Theyre the unromantic ones the ones who calculate coldly the synergistic relationship between sex and power. It must be said that theres something immensely pleasurable about the instant intimacies of beautiful people. And if your taste runs to psychodrama with barbed metronomical banter and booming dramatic beats youll probably think this is a hell of a good movie. It certainly has more nuances than comparable exercises by Neil Labute who always stacks the deck by making one of his characters a demonic psychopath. These people all have their reasons. But Closer is in the same arena as Labute and I found it sour and airless with the feel of a mathematical proof. The last slow-motion shot a sardonic variation on the first is a slap in the face. The acting is superb though with one key exception. Jude Law was in Alfie a few weeks ago and although his character here is supposed to have depth its hard to see him as anything but a callow womanizer. Maybe a more resourceful actor would have made us forget the last six performances this year but Law doesnt have many tricks up his sleeve. On the other hand Natalie Portman has a chance to prove shes not the petrified zombie of those Star Wars pageants; shes raw here with a pleading presence that can suddenly turn cold. Clive Owen is stunning too Id never before noticed his big choppers--the center of a frightening big-bad-wolf leer. Hes the rough trade John Lennon to Jude Laws fine-featured Paul McCartney. My favorite of the quartet though is Julia Roberts. Dressed in loose unglamorous clothes and with her hair pulled back she gives the quietest least ostentatious performance wary and overdefended but in her very tightness exquisitely vulnerable. I can never believe how this woman insufferably exhibitionistic on talk and award shows could have such uncanny radar when the (movie) cameras roll. Its enough to make you believe in the magic of acting--in alchemy. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

"No Closer Than Arms Length washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen No Closer Than Arms Length Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 3 2004 IS HE LYING? Is she? Did he sleep with the other woman behind her back? Did she sleep with the other guy? In Mike Nicholss ""Closer"" these pressing matters of the jealous heart send four modern lovers into a roiling tizzy over the course of a few years. Its a saucy premise especially when you consider the comely presence of Jude Law Julia Roberts Clive Owen and Natalie Portman doing all that bed-hopping partner-swapping and truth-lopping. And theres the added attraction of Nichols returning to his signature subject the war between the sexes as seen in such classics as ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" ""The Graduate"" and ""Carnal Knowledge."" But if ""Closer"" shows us the whole Sturm und Drang of modern relationships -- attraction deception jealousy and passion -- it doesnt show us much more. Nicholss sophisticated direction screenwriter Patrick Marbers irony-laden dialogue and the eye-candilicious presence of our stars produce nothing more than surface warfare. In London obituary writer Dan (Law) falls in love with (or feels really really attracted to) a twenty-something American visitor (Portman) a stripper who has made the mistake of looking the wrong way crossing the street. Knocked over by a cab and unconscious for a few seconds she looks up to see Dan bending over her. ""Hello stranger"" she says. Off they go to the emergency room to check her out and to get acquainted. Her name she tells him is Alice. And down the romantic rabbit hole they go bound for curiouser and curiouser complications. Dan and Alice have become an item when Dan meets photographer Anna (Roberts) who is separated. After some cutesy verbal jousting its clear theyre attracted to each other. But there is the inconvenience of Alice. When Anna learns about Alice she resists Dans advances. But only at first. Frustrated by Annas initial reluctance Dan gets on to a sex chat site and posing as Anna exchanges sexually frank instant messages with Larry (Owen) a lonely and horny dermatologist. But when Dan (still playing Anna) arranges to meet Larry at a local aquarium for a sexual encounter never intending to show up he causes more havoc than he intended. Looking around for some sexual firebrand called ""Anna"" Larry bumps into the real Anna (whos sitting right next to him at the aquarium) and makes savory remarks. In one of the movies many extended stagy conversations Larry and Anna mutually figure out Dans role in all this and embark on an affair of their own. Now we are four. Let the complications begin. ""Closer"" could have been a fine farce with just a few adjustments like funny lines and situations. But Nichols and Marber (adapting his play) are going for serious and tortured. Too bad ""serious and tortured"" in this case is so external and superficial. Even though all four performers work themselves into an acting frenzy (with Owen and Portman coming off best) they are mere deliverers of snippy smart-alecky rejoinders -- as if Nichols is trying to reevoke the verbal snap that screenwriter Jules Feiffer brought to ""Carnal Knowledge."" As characters theyre almost interchangeable. You could swap around their circumstances without any noticeable difference. Dan could be the photographer heck even the stripper. Alice the stripper could be a dermatologist; Portman does have great skin after all. The great romantic comedies (and tragedies) brim over with insights and bons mots about the craziness of love the neverending tussle between the genders and the importance of love as a way of life. In ""Closer"" everything is tearful confessions angry interrogations and breakups. But theres nothing underneath. Sure theres a rubber-necky attraction to watching these good-looking half-baked creations living anguished photogenic lifestyles. But its unclear if were supposed to feel engaged. Does love matter in this movie? Is it the answer? And is there anything to be gleaned from the movie other than ""Oops I Did It Again""? There is still no apparent wisdom as the closing credits come up. CLOSER (R 103 minutes) -- Contains graphic sexual language nudity sexual scenes and obscenity. Area theaters.

In just a few minutes Larry (Clive Owen) has experienced the first five stages of the cuckolded male denial derision pleading sobbing threatening. Now in confronting Anna (Julia Roberts) about her lover Dan (Jude Law) he atavizes into Caveman the alpha male in competitive fury. ""Where did you make love What parts of the house what parts of the body?"" ""How did Dan perform?"" ""Was he better?"" ""Gentler"" she acknowledges depleted by the hard truths hes forcing out of her. ""Sweeter."" Larry finally has what he wanted the instant utter and mutual eradication of their year-long love. ""Thank you for your honesty"" he tells her. ""Now f___ off and die."" Its a pulverizing few minutes in Closer the funny hurtful splendidly acted new film that Mike Nichols has made from Patrick Marbers play and screenplay. The scene leaves the audience as flush and drained as the participants. ""I thought we were way past being able to shock anybody"" says Nichols 73 who has directed his fair share of cinematic sexual frissons. ""But people are shocked. Its not necessarily because of the language but because things that usually go unexplored are explored in public. Some people are armed against it. They say I just dont know those people.

After all as Alice declares ""lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off."" But if lying has a toxic residue the truth can kill instantly. Larry in interrogating Anna casts off all pride to find the self-lacerating the ultimate male truth. Was he better? Closer runs counter to the numbing predictability of most current films the inevitable plot points of revenge and uplift the reduction of human beings to heroes and villains the avoidance of complexity in sexual matters. If a batch of recent movies were to ask ""Are we sexier more mature -- better -- than films of 30 years ago?"" the brutal truthful answer would be ""No way."" Its true that films are more sex-obsessed these days. All of pop culture is. Americans listen to Howard Stern giggle over Janet Jackson collect unrated DVD editions of the American Pie movies gossip about celebrities dirty secrets. We ogle (and then condemn) the dropping of a towel on a Monday Night Football teaser leaf through Jenna Jamesons How to Make Love Like a Porn Star log onto the Internet and bathe in all that warm cyberswill. But all this is essentially kid stuff somewhere between adolescent and infantile in its voyeuristic avidity. It codifies the randy talk in a boys tree house the boasts and jokes and threats that mask the fear of (Ugh Gross) growing up. Contrast today with the early 1970s when movies like Straw Dogs The Devils Last Tango in Paris and Nichols own Carnal Knowledge promised a future of truly adult depictions of sex. At the same time the first wave of porno chic lured the curious to the burgeoning genre of hard-core. It seemed as if these two types of films might meet -- that cinema might learn to depict the ordinary universal and melodramatic collision of two bodies two souls in bed. But those days and those hopes are deader than disco. Hollywoods erotic audacity and artistic pretensions have shriveled ever since.
