Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Sophie Gilbert May 15 2015 Culture Its maybe fair to assume that nobody expected Pitch Perfect the 2012 comedy about an ill-matched preposterously awkward collegial a cappella troupe to be as good as it was. For one thing the demographic it targeted was women under the age of 25. Its director Jason Moore was a rookie whose only previous experience was in theater and television. And its premise was enormously dorky even if the concept of a group of misfits coming together in song in an educational setting had been previously popularized by Foxs Glee. Pitch Perfect was by turns gross offensive and glorious and its combination of acerbic one-liners and a cast full of oddballs made it that Hollywood white whale a word-of-mouth success.Related Story Music Made Glee and Music Killed It So it might be unfair to expect Pitch Perfect 2 to live up to the unanticipated brilliance of the first movie and the film doesnt really seem to try even with the producer Elizabeth Banks now in the directors chair. All of the characters are back--Anna Kendrick as the tomboyish wannabe DJ Beca Rebel Wilson as the foul-mouthed extrovert Fat Amy Brittany Snow as the sunny peacemaker Chloe--but this time their chemistry is off and what felt like winking cheekiness in the first movie can come across now more like clumsy provocation.The film opens three years later with Beca and the rest of the Barden Bellas living in a house on campus having won three straight national championships. While performing an exhilarating set in front of the President and the First Lady at the Kennedy Center (a mashup of Keshas ""Timber"" and Miley Cyrus ""Wrecking Ball"") Fat Amy comes in indeed like a juggernaut suffering an unfortunate wardrobe malfunction that renders the Bellas in the Barden University deans words ""a national disgrace.""After this mishap with their reputations in tatters and having been banned from recruiting new members the plot revolves around the Bellas trying to redeem themselves and keep up with the competition an absurd German troupe called Das Sound Machine who manage to be world sensations even though accents this fake havent been seen in cinema since Bram Stokers Dracula. And after three years the ladies are drifting apart. Beca secretly takes an internship at a recording studio where Snoop Dogg is trying to cut a Christmas album (her boss played by Keegan-Michael Key is a high point) Fat Amy is still secretly sleeping with Bumper (Adam DeVine) Chloe has deliberately failed Russian for three years straight so she never has to graduate and move on in the world and ... no one else gets anything to do. At all.Pitch Perfect somehow delivered more than a dozen fully formed characters in under two hours with much of the comedy coming from the supporting characters--the proudly sexually active Stacie (Alexis Knapp) the sexually ambiguous Cynthia-Rose (Ester Dean) the unabashed ""I ate my twin in the womb"" pixie Lilly (Hana Mae Lee). Theyre all here as is writer Kay Cannon whose history working on shows like 30 Rock and New Girl was felt in every inappropriate punchline in the first movie. But they might as well not be because theyre left alone almost entirely with the focus instead being two new Bellas a ""legacy"" Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) whos allowed to join because her mother was a legendary Bella in the past and Florencia (Chrissie Fit) who gamely trots out gag after gag about the horrors of being from Central America (""when I was nine my brother tried to sell me for a chicken."")What felt like winking cheekiness in the first movie can come across now more like clumsy provocation.The movie is slyly feminist throughout In her role as the a cappella commentator Gail Abernathy-McKadden Elizabeth Banks points out that the Bellas are icons for ""girls all over the world who are too ugly to be cheerleaders."" The media criticism leveled at both Fat Amy and the Bellas feels appropriately hysterical in tenor with everyone from Jake Tapper to the women of The View jumping in the fray to condemn the troupes lack of dignity (even in 2015 nothing is apparently as shocking to America as uncensored lady parts). And the plot doesnt even try to mine drama from Becas relationship with Jesse (Skylar Astin) who appears only briefly as a loving and supportive boyfriend. In this--in making a movie about women thats only summarily concerned with their love lives at best--Pitch Perfect 2 should be saluted. But it also coasts on its own success delivering quips that feel like pallid imitations of the first films zany charm and resisting any urge to make the few song-and-dance routines any bigger than they contractually have to be. After the opening montage an hour rolls by with barely a single number. ""Is it weird that we didnt do any singing?"" asks Emily after her first Bella rehearsal. Shes not the only one wondering.There are undeniable highlights Reggie Watts John Hodgman Joe Lo Truglio and Jason Jones have cameos as the second-weirdest non-collegiate a cappella troupe (the first-weirdest is even better but to say any more would ruin the fun). Theres a weekend at a team-building lodge where another legacy member returns to try and whip the Bellas back into shape. Theres Robin Roberts (really). Theres Snoop Dogg singing ""Winter Wonderland"" while Keegan-Michael Key tries not to emit a primal scream of musical disgust. And theres ultimately a showdown with a group of genetically superior Germans in which only history can point at the probable victors.But there isnt the same sense of gleeful disregard for what people might think or the weird indescribable joy that comes from seeing a group of completely incompatible people come together in an interpretation of Kelly Clarkson that can only be described as transcendent. The actors dont seem all that energized to be back and the overarching sense of ennui is contagious. Instead Pitch Perfect 2 relies like so many comedies do on fart gags and racial stereotypes and odd-couple pairings without any of the wryness from the first film to indicate that everyone including the audience is in on the joke. It is in the most basic terms the worst thing a reigning a cappella champ can be--flat.

Twitter previousRuss Feingold Wants a RematchnextYou Can Now Buy a Bernie Sanders Teddy Bear Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

Entertainment How ""Pitch Perfect 2"" Stacks Up Against The First Movie TL;DR The music is better and the comedy is worse. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Universal Pictures ID 5703133 Pitch Perfect was Bring It On meets Glee -- the kind of movie that felt like a comfy childhood favorite even when it was brand new in theaters the kind that youd stop and watch whenever you stumbled across it on cable. It was a surprise hit only in the context of the industrys Memento-like inability to remember that young women like to watch movies too and not just as presumedly reluctant companions of the young men at whom most blockbusters are flagrantly aimed. The 2012 movie directed by Jason Moore was warmhearted and rickety filled with enjoyable musical numbers and jokes that werent always targeted very carefully. For the second installment which opens in theaters on May 15 producer and cast member Elizabeth Banks (she plays Gail Abernathy-McKadden one half of a brutal commentating pair) is making her directorial debut. Most of the Barden Bellas are now in their senior year but their story otherwise recycles most of the same beats -- so how does the sequel measure up against the first Pitch Perfect? Heres a look. ID 5699991 3. Beca View this image > Universal Pictures Throughout Pitch Perfect 2 Anna Kendrick maintains the vaguely disgruntled air of someone whod rather be elsewhere which is fine because the movies provided her character Beca with another storyline about how shed rather be elsewhere too. In the sequel Becas mind is on her internship at a record production house where she does coffee runs and tries to curry favor with a demanding boss (played by Keegan-Michael Key whos everywhere this summer). The distraction puts her at odds with Chloe (Brittany Snow) but also means she spends a lot of the movie doing her own thing rather than spending time with the group. It feels undeniably strange that the main character of both movies has spent so much time distancing herself from the thing the movies are about and Becas storyline is clumsily dovetailed with that of the underwritten newcomer Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) whos only ever wanted to be a Bella. The repetition of ""Ive got more important things to do"" isnt just stale it feels like a mistake in a movie thats all about the Bellas last hurrah before graduation. Shouldnt Beca be more into this by now? Winner Pitch Perfect ID 5702035 4. The music View this image > Universal Pictures The mash-ups are back choreographer Aakomon Jones is back and in a new development the Bellas actually flirt with the aca-transgressive idea of performing an original tune -- ""Flashlight"" which in the movie is composed by new Bella Emily and performed on the soundtrack by Jessie J. It doesnt have the same wistful charm of Kendricks ""Cups"" but it doesnt need to. Its a big arms outstretched Katy Perry-esque number thats threaded through the movie in various forms one that really soars in its final and fullest appearance. Like Pitch Perfect itself it manages to feel familiar even though it isnt. ""Cups"" does get a reprise as does the ""riff-off"" one of the highlights of the first movie which is actually bigger and better in the sequel taking place at an underground party hosted by the self-declared ""worlds biggest a cappella fan"" (played by David Cross) and filled out with some welcome cameos. The Bellas big rivals in Pitch Perfect 2 the German group Das Sound Machine get a few amusingly precise musical numbers of their own. Led by Birgitte Hjort Sorensen and Flula Borg and dressed like the villains in a dystopian YA story ""DSM"" manages a bit of choreography thats simultaneously clever and silly. Despite plot requirements the Bellas arent always the obvious singing standouts theyre meant to be but their mash-ups are even more impeccably put together this go-round. Winner Pitch Perfect 2 ID 5700282 5. Fat Amy View this image > Richard Cartwright / Universal Pictures Rebel Wilsons outsize oddball Fat Amy was Pitch Perfects breakout character walking away with a movie that veered into laughing at her as much as it laughed with her sometimes suggesting her unshakable confidence was unearned. Fat Amy is just as funny and IDGAF in the sequel but the movie continues to undercut her as much as celebrate her. The opening sequence -- in which Fat Amy accidentally ends up flashing an audience that includes the president first lady and Shonda Rhimes -- is built around her nudity being repellent rather than in any way sexual. Its impossible to imagine a similar gag in which Beca or Chloe unintentionally shows a theater full of people her vagina. Then again Fat Amy isnt destroyed by the incident the way a more shakable human inevitably would be -- shes possessed of a bulletproof sense of self. Pitch Perfect 2 gives Fat Amy a romance thats actually pretty sweet playing off gender role expectations and culminating in a swooning romantic gesture thats as poignant as it is funny. But then it concludes with a kiss thats more like two dogs licking each others faces because god forbid the overweight girl get some in a way thats not ultimately treated as grotesque. Winner Tie ID 5698958 6. The comedy View this image > Richard Cartwright / Universal Pictures Pitch Perfects relationship with race and sexuality had discordant notes throughout the first movie -- consider Lilly Okanakamura (Hana Mae Lee) who may have had some delightfully weird lines that no one but the audience could hear but whose character was entirely based around a silent Asian girl stereotype that seemed particularly egregious in a movie about making noise. Becas hostile Korean American roommate was also awkwardly handled and the treatment of Cynthia-Roses (Ester Dean) lesbianism felt like the painful setup to a bit without the much-needed resolution. Pitch Perfect 2 is even worse when it comes to would-be provocative humor and jokes that dont land. In addition to Lilly whos unchanged the movie doubles down on the race-based tone deafness with the addition of Flo (Chrissie Fit) who only speaks when shes trying to relate to her downtrodden fellow Bellas by talking about how terrible life was in her home country of Guatemala -- ""I had diarrhea for seven years"" she explains earnestly. Its hard to come up with a reading of the repeated jokes about kidnapping and border crossing thats not ""Developing nations are hilarious hellscapes"" Still her scenes arent as wince-worthy as the ones in which Banks and John Michael Higgins reprise their roles as a cappella competition commentators. The pairs off-color cracks escalate into bits of bigotry without a punchline in sight other than offensiveness. When the joke is that one of them thinks its funny to say a Latina character will ""backflip right over the fence into Mexico"" its time for a rewrite -- maybe for the inevitable Pitch Perfect 3.

"Pitch Perfect 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pitch-perfect-2 ) Pitch Perfect 2 (United States 2015) May 16 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Spoiler Warning Because I reveal things about the ending of Pitch Perfect 2 in this review I am duty-bound to warn readers in case they wish to stop now. (Of course if you dont care feel free to continue...) I am as far from the target demographic for Pitch Perfect 2 as a member of the human race can possibly be. The wrong age. The wrong gender. The wrong disposition. If I was being snarky I could add additional qualifiers but I wont go there. Nevertheless one doesnt have to be in the filmmakers bulls-eye to recognize the quality (or lack thereof) of a motion picture. And regardless of whatever ephemeral entertainment this production may offer to some it is not by any reasonable definition a good movie. It is badly written inexpertly directed poorly acted erratically paced and features music of dubious worth. Its possible to enjoy Pitch Perfect 2 the same way one enjoys a TV variety show - with the higher functions of the brain disengaged. This isnt cinema; its vaudeville. Like its more watchable predecessor which at least featured solid directing and editing and a degree of giddiness during the high-energy songs Pitch Perfect 2 follows the conventions of a sports movie. And as is often the case with sports movies theres really nowhere to go with installment 2. So the sequel which exists for financial and not creative reasons rehashes past glories and does what it can to advance a paper-thin story that previously concluded satisfactorily. Somehow the movie manages to mess up the most basic aspect of any sports movie. And by not sticking the ending it leaves the viewer with a vague hard-to-define sense of dissatisfaction. The problem is this the uber-nasty Teutonic bad guys dont get their comeuppance.  Sure they lose. The good guys take home the gold. But the victory is so muted that we dont get the moment of gloating we feel we deserve. Imagine if Rocky 4 (a good analog for Pitch Perfect 2) had ended with Rocky triumphing via a split decision. He would still have won and Ivan Drago would have lost but how would the audience have felt?  Thats Pitch Perfect 2. Some might argue that the movie isnt really about the big competition at the end - its about cardboard characters ""evolving."" Truth is no one in this film shows credible growth despite the lip service paid to how they have changed.  Thats surprising when one considers that a key ingredient for growth is fertilizer and Pitch Perfect 2 has no shortage of it.  If winning at the end matters only insofar as it relates to character development why bother spending so much time making the rival team as nasty and unappealing as possible? With no place to go the movie falls back on the sports movie sequel staple - taking things to the next level. Now that the Barden Bellas have conquered America how about the world? After being banned from performing Stateside due to a ""wardrobe malfunction"" in front of President Obama at Lincoln Center they seek to repair their reputation by representing their country overseas in the Olympics of Acappella. There they face their nemesis a German team called Das Sound Machine with a dominatrix lead singer (Birgitte Hjort Sorensen) and back-ups who were dusted off the neo-Nazi stereotype casting shelf. In what is intended to be a running joke Bella singer Beca (Anna Kendrick) develops a lesbian crush on her tall blond opponent. The reunion gives every character a subplot to pursue each less compelling than the next. Beca gazing into the mists of her life beyond the Bellas seeks to pursue music production by accepting a secret internship. Of course this leads to success - but only after initial frustration. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson the female version of Chris Farley) finds love in an unexpected place. Chloe (Brittany Snow) frets over what will happen to her after graduation. Aubrey (Anna Camp) the projectile vomiting champ from the first film returns like Apollo Creed to train the Bellas for their upcoming competition. The new blood is provided by Hailee Steinfeld as Emily the daughter of a former Bella whose disastrous beginning with the group paves the way for her to make a big contribution at the end. Truthfully though no one goes to a movie like Pitch Perfect 2 for the story. They go for the music (I guess). This is Glee for the big screen; where else can you go to hear stars croak karaoke-level covers of ""Shake Your Booty"" ""Wrecking Ball"" ""Baby Got Back"" ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" and ""We Belong""? Strangely however while theres no shortage of tunes the energy that characterized the performances in the first film is absent. Some of the blame has to go to actress-turned-director Elizabeth Banks who not only mishandles the musical numbers but is tone-deaf when it comes to comedy and flow. Pitch Perfect lurches from one vignette to the next without any clear sense of purpose. The comedy in Pitch Perfect 2 falls into the ""cheap and easy"" (and frequently unfunny) category. Rebel Wilson provides the lions share of the films ""humor"" with abrasive cartoonish vigor. If nothing else the movie cant be accused of being politically correct. The jokes are occasionally homophobic sexist and wallow in ethnic and nationalistic stereotypes. The Germans speak with ""funny"" accents and the Asian/Latino members of the Bellas have no purpose other than to utter ""funny"" non-sequiturs. If the intention is to disempower such views through satire Banks mishandles the material. Pitch Perfect 2 is a lot like a Transformers film in that its popularity is impossible to understand for a nonbeliever. Like the Michael Bay franchise this one has a large share of passionate defenders (who will begin issuing death threats as soon as this review is posted) and is bulletproof at the box office. The demographic may be different but the feeling of having been subjected to untreated sewage is similar.

Because of a wardrobe malfunction at a high-profile performance (with the Obamas in attendance) the Barden Bellas Americas collegiate-champion a-cappella group are banned from domestic competition--and must instead win a world title in order to be spared dissolution. Meanwhile with graduation looming the members of the group have life choices to make Beca (Anna Kendrick) the most musically talented secretly takes an internship at a recording studio; Chloe (Brittany Snow) the leader of the pack delays facing life after college; Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) cant admit that shes in love. The groups chemistry is altered by the arrival of an over-eager freshman (Hailee Steinfeld) just as theyre preparing to face the existential threat of a swaggering German troupe. Meanwhile the bickering commentators John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks who also directed) offer wan comic diversion. In her feature directorial debut Banks doesnt reveal much personality though her affection for the performers is evident; theyre a joy to watch but they have little to do. Ethnic cliches abound college comes off as a free sleepaway camp and the simple wonders of unaccompanied singing are inflated to Las Vegas-style bombast.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

"Pitch Perfect 2 - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Pitch Perfect 2 Posted by Christy Lemire on May 17 2015 3 Comments Universal Pictures Rated PG-13 for innuendo and language. Running time 114 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four. Stop me if you think youve heard this one before. A perky group of college a cappella singers suffers an embarrassing on-stage mishap then fights to redeem itself and regain its former glory. Along the way theres a little romance a lot of trash talk an impromptu sing-off with rival groups some bawdy moments from a brash supporting player and plenty of clueless commentary courtesy of an announcing duo that also serves as the films Greek chorus. Yes ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is pretty much the exact same movie as ""Pitch Perfect."" In theory this is great if you loved the original film which became a sleeper hit in 2012. I loved the first ""Pitch Perfect"" so much I gave it three and a half stars out of four but much of what I loved about it was how refreshing it felt. It was cheeky and snarky and it pulled off the tricky feat of making us fall in love with the very thing it was making fun of. Its earnestness and exuberance were infectious in equal measure. There is no single moment here that matches the ingenuity of Anna Kendricks ""Cups"" audition no song that brings you to the verge of tears with its sheer beauty like her spontaneous shower duet with Brittany Snow to David Guetta and Sias ""Titanium."" The best scene in the entire movie is a rip-off of the best scene from the first movie a riff-off with various other singing groups filled with inspired cameos and organized by a delightfully odd David Cross. ""Pitch Perfect 2"" has plenty of laughs scattered throughout but it also struggles to regain that balance and that sense of breeziness. It runs out of steam somewhere in the middle and probably could have been a good solid 20 minutes shorter. Making her feature directing debut co-star and producer Elizabeth Banks stages the production numbers in brisk and entertaining fashion -- its just the actual cohesive story in between that tends to bog things down. (As in the first film Kay Cannon wrote the script; mercifully there seem to be fewer made-up words with aca- in front of them.) One of the main problems with ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is that it marginalizes its star the infinitely talented and adorable Kendrick. Becas arc from reluctant performer to driving creative force gave the first film momentum and her romance with the charismatic Skylar Astin from the all-male a cappella group the Treblemakers provided a nice spark. She had attitude. She had an edge about her which was a great change of pace for Kendrick compared to the good-girl Type-A characters shed mostly played. Here shes reduced to a supporting figure and Astin is an afterthought in just a handful of scenes. Rebel Wilson is the films star this time. Granted ""Pitch Perfect 2"" remains an ensemble -- and an ever-expanding one at that -- but Wilson was such a scene stealer last time as a brassy Aussie who nicknamed herself Fat Amy that shes been given even more room to work her inappropriate comic shtick. As enjoyable as Wilson can be shes also rather one-note and a little of her goes a long way. Speaking of notes the songs that the Barden Bellas and their competitors sing are even more polished and overproduced than ever to the point that theres an emotional disconnect. But things dont go so well off the top. As reigning national a cappella champs the Bellas have the honor of performing for President Obama and the first lady. But a wardrobe malfunction during a complicated maneuver by Fat Amy -- which comes to be known as Muffgate in an unfortunate bit of female body shaming -- makes the ladies a laughingstock and costs them their title. (Once again Banks and John Michael Higgins crop up as a Christopher Guest mockumentary-style broadcasting team to provide perspective through satirically sexist and racist remarks. Some of these are hilarious; others land with a thud.) But Through a loophole the Bellas are still allowed to represent the United States at the world championships in Copenhagen. There they will face a juggernaut German group called Das Sound Machine which essentially consists of about 20 people doing that ""Sprockets"" bit from ""Saturday Night Live"" as they sing songs like ""Insane in Ze Membrane."" Their leader is a gorgeous blonde Teutonic stereotype (Birgitte Hjort Sorensen) who repeatedly gets Beca giddy and tongue-tied. Insecurity and skittishness however are not what this character is about. And so its also odd to see Beca scurrying off to a secret internship at a record company because shes afraid to tell the Bellas and let them down -- even though you know she and the other ladies are seniors now and should be thinking about their futures. (Then again Bella co-leader Chloe played once again by an enthusiastic Snow has stayed in college for seven years because shes so afraid of the real world.) The presence of comedian Keegan-Michael Key as Becas demanding but ultimately enlightening boss significantly improves this subplot though. But wait theres more. As part of Wilsons larger role here she also gets a more significant romance with Adam DeVine as the Treblemakers cocky former leader including a bombastic duet which is pretty amusing. All the other supporting players from the first ""Pitch Perfect"" are back including Hana Mae Lee with her absurd and nearly silent asides (a bit that was funnier the first time). And theres a new recruit in freshman Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) a singer-songwriter and legacy whose mother (Katey Sagal in a barely-there part) was a legendary Bella more than 30 years ago. Clearly the stage is being set for ""Pitch Perfect 3"" -- whether the world needs it or not.

For the first time this year three films have surpassed 30mil beautifully ushering in an exciting year of cinema and were complaining because..? Should one film be valued higher than the others? The magic of movies is we all get to choose to go somewhere else for some thats back to college with misfits and breakouts in song others thats nonstop balls-out racing action. Fuck yea. Its an exciting time to love movies. For the record Ive seen both and loved both they appeal to completely different sides of my taste/imagination. Totally cool if its not your thing but shouldnt we all be champions of successful creative cinema? Reply May 30 2015  by  Realist Joe     Delete Just so we are clear you are suggesting that a movie utterly lacking in an interesting narrative character development authentic dialogue or original scenes and then filled with tasteless jokes and racists/sexist humor should be celebrated because its had a big marketing budget and can ride on the success of the original movie? We should give it a good review because people have suffered through watching it after shelling out money? We went with a 9 and 11 year old because they love the original movie. Unprovoked they both said the first movie was better and that some of the jokes were ""mean."" We need to call out shameless attempts to squeeze out more money from people for poor sequels like this not be happy for the industry revenue. This combination is actually whats broken about the industry not a successful example. Reply June 14 2015  by  Becca     All I know is that I went I laughed (as did the rest of the theatre) and was completely entertained and distracted from my own problems for 2 hours-and thats why I go to the movies.

Iave never seen her so flat-out bad a distracted depressed convictionless. 893 Shares Share 861 Tweet 29 Share 2 Share Email Print Share Photo Universal Pictures As I watchedA Pitch Perfect 2 I found myself wonderingA Why do so many Hollywood studios make sequels to movies that dont need sequels? Why not make something original instead -- especially if there isnt a goodA ideaA for a second movie? Okay okay Im just messing with you. Weve all been around this block once or twice. But it actually is difficult to write a review ofA Pitch Perfect 2. First you have to think up and reject a bunch of adjectives and nouns to pair with ""a ca"" as in ""Its a ca-lousy"" or ""Its a ca-piece of shit."" Then you have to spell out -- because critics are reporters too -- what happens in the movie which is hard (and reads boringly) when its the same thing that happened in the last one except without the laughs. So this is the plot. The college female a cappella group the Barden Bellas is riding high when theres a major public gross-out embarrassment and they lose their stature. Then they have to figure out how to work harmoniously together and ""find their sound"" again so they can win the big competition against another group that has made them feel small. I just went back and read my review of the first Pitch Perfect. You can read it too if you want. I sound really happy. Its like Id seen something that made my life better and I was enjoying telling people about it. Gosh that seems like such a long time ago. Did you know I put Pitch Perfect on my year-end ten-best list? Im guessing Kay Cannon thought hard about whether to write the script but that the offer was for more money than she or anyone in her family had made in their entire lives put together. Then she probably had three days to write it which is why she settled for lines like ""This place is all about booby traps and guess what? Boobs should never be trapped."" Shed have taken that out of a second draft thinking It was worth a try. There are good ideas that needed another pass like the way Beca (Anna Kendrick) is so overcome with a sense of inferiority when she confronts the Bellas new nemesis the tall blonde leader of a German a cappella group that she blurts out compliments instead of insults. She should work on that one with Amy Schumer -- it could play. Im also guessing Kendrick did not want to come back. Ive never seen her so flat-out bad -- distracted depressed conviction-less. Anna I still adore you but you should have tried to make it work. I doubt youd have succeeded but Id have lit you a memorial candle and saluted. I dont want to be writing this goddamn review either and Im not getting Hollywood sequel money. Brittany Snow gives it the old college try as Chloe. And Hailee Steinfeld who plays a freshman newcomer and is for all intents and purposes the protagonist has pep and heart. I guess thats also true of real freshman who come in full of pep and heart and have to deal with seniors who say ""Yeah whatever"" and have one eye on the exit. Rebel Wilsons ""Fat Amy"" had good tart comebacks in the last one but this time theyre not funny so shes more like ""Fat Mean Amy."" Since the springboard for the plot is Fat Amy accidentally ""going commando"" in front of President Obama and his family I can understand her not smiling much. Her best line is about sleeping with all the Wiggles. Keegan-Michael Key plays the boss at the recording studio where Beca has an internship and scores by underplaying. If Im ever a boss criticizing an underling who cant make a piece of equipment function I hope I sound as reasonable when I say ""Do you understand everything in my life works so I need this to work too."" The director this time is different actress Elizabeth Banks who co-produced Pitch Perfect and repeats her role as one of the ill-matched competition commentators (with John Michael Higgins as her boorish partner). I dont normally do this but she should have paid attention to my review of the original ""Director Jason Moore is a Broadway hand (Avenue Q) who knows how to sell a number without assaulting the audience ... "" Then shed have thought ""Maybe I shouldnt assault the audience either."" She over-edits the musical numbers and underlines the jokes with pushy close-ups. Its even possible some of Cannons more cringe-worthy quips would have played without the campy overemphasis. Well never know. Against the odds the Bellas climactic number in Pitch Perfect 2 is excellent so the audience goes out on a relatively happy note. Id have preferred a final number as a ca-piece of shit as the rest of the movie to guarantee thered be no Pitch Perfect 3. Because writing this review is bringing me down.

"Pitch Perfect 2 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Pitch Perfect 2 A Fans Lament Pitch Perfect 2 A Fans Lament Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 15 2015 105 PM Pitch Perfect 2 A fans lament for a cynical sequel that cares less about the joy of music than it aca-oughta. By Carl Wilson Hailee Steinfeld Anna Kendrick Brittany Snow Alexis Knapp and Rebel Wilson in Pitch Perfect 2. Photo by Richard Cartwright/Universal Pictures Two weeks ago for about a day I allowed myself to get excited about the upcoming premiere of Pitch Perfect 2 the follow-up to 2012s improbable hit comedy about the competitive collegiate a cappella circuit--or as one of the characters put it ""organized nerd-singing."" Then I came back to my senses and to that familiar contemporary condition for which there ought to be a word probably a German one the dread of a superfluous sequel to a small beloved original. (Uberschussangst?) Like many people I suspect I was startled by how hard I fell for the original Pitch Perfect. The premise did nothing to lure me to the movie theater as I had no particular attachment to Glee Nick Lacheys a cappella TV competition show The Sing-Off or say Bobby McFerrin. But when it came to pay-per-view on a whim I gave it a chance. Within minutes I was helplessly beguiled despite so much of it being cliched silly and borderline offensive. Ever since whenever I catch it playing on TV Im unable to pass it up. I must have seen it six or seven times ... OK a dozen. It exudes a gold-staying joy via some kind of alchemy among the cast (mostly women led by Anna Kendrick about whom Id never given a damn till then) the thin but ""fat-hearted"" plot (straight out of teen-team-competition flicks such as Bring It On Step Up etc.) and especially the music. Advertisement Taking place in a half-imaginary world in which a cappella is still dorky yet somehow glamorous and celebrated (based on the real-life reporting of GQs Mickey Rapkin) Pitch Perfect stakes its all on loving pop music on knowing it deeply enough to disassemble and rearrange it and find your true self there--and yet not take it overly seriously. Made up mainly of infinitely rewatchable set pieces the film shows the characters working hard on their craft but also draws on classic movie-musical magic to endow them with impossible reserves of spontaneous virtuosity as in the movies peak the glorious too-brief late-night ""riff-off"" contest in a drained campus swimming pool--for the acoustics of course. It never forgets however that what its glorifying is basically a goofy supersquare pastime the musical equivalent of Dungeons amp; Dragons. Along with Kendricks character Beca an aspiring DJ with a spiky cool-girl attitude who joins the Barden Bellas reluctantly viewers can hang their skepticism on Gail and John (Elizabeth Banks and veteran Christopher Guest film improviser John Michael Higgins) the aged-out adults who provide alternately unenthused and deadpan-idiotic color commentary for each starry competition in ""making music with your mouth."" You can make a melodrama about street dance says Pitch Perfect but about a cappella it is necessary to laugh. So did I want more Pitch Perfect? Of course. Maybe this time without so many jokes based on ethnic stereotypes one-dimensional traits (the fat girl the slut the lesbian the weirdo) and extremely disgusting vomiting. Twice the Pitch Perfect would mean twice the hours of blissing out on the couch in vicarious singalong ecstasy--or else as my Uberschussangst quickly reminded me cringing and moaning ""What have you done to my baby?"" As it turns out its a little of both. Pitch Perfect 2 does offer a few more doses of the abandon the first movie was drenched in for which any fan will be grateful. But it also loses its way. Thankfully it does nothing to ruin the original but most of its attempts to advance the concept amount to regressions instead. Advertisement The new film again written by improv comic Kay Cannon (30 Rock) and this time directed by Banks skips ahead a few years from the last. The Bellas under Becas direction have won several more national championships and are on the verge of graduating (some of them belatedly because they cant let go). They are doing a high-profile gig for the presidents birthday--the Obamas are spliced into the scene very convincingly--when they are humiliated by a ""wardrobe malfunction"" during a cover of Miley Cyrus ""Wrecking Ball."" The gag depends on body-shaming the ""Fat Amy"" character (the ebulliently game Rebel Wilson) even more than the original movie did basically implying that vaginas are gross fat girls are gross and fat girls vaginas are really gross. It does not make an auspicious start and its a bellwether of the failure of Pitch Perfect 2 Rather than use the first films success as a reason to move on confidently from the cheap shots it doubles down. Theres a new Guatemalan Bella whose every line is a gag about poverty and illegal immigration and a continuing current of gay jokes that are obviously not meant literally but remain as a shield against a cappellas overall queer ambience. Its not homophobia so much as it is internalized geek-ophobia Hollywoods discomfort with making movies for nerds which when it comes to singing include a lot of gay and ""ethnic"" nerds. The Pitch Perfect franchise often stumbles on this line between cheerful self-deprecation and compensatory bullying. Likewise its always trying to have its feminism both ways as when Beca walks in on her Bella sisters having a pillow fight and tells them ""You know this sets women back 30 years""--they listen and then go right back to bouncing around. Advertisement ""Muffgate"" results in the Barden Bellas suspension from national competition their only recourse being the international finals in Copenhagen Denmark where no American team ever wins because the world hates America. Their rivals turn out to be a comically fit crew from Germany Das Sound Machine whose superhumanity is a cute foil to the Bellas batch of misfits. But its cardboard villainy. Instead of an easily booed bunch of Aryans the movie might have set the Bellas up against one of the Asian or African teams we glimpse toward the end and dealt with our leading pack of underdogs feeling conflicted about their position of advantage needing to find empathy within the rivalry. The first movie raised that kind of question with the dynamics between the male and female teams but theres no parallel here. In fact our heroes barely face any substantial obstacles. The first film was about redemption not just for the Bellas but for a cappella itself requiring both Beca and the audience to discard their prejudices and embrace the embarrassment. That job is taken as complete here so for the most part its all a victory lap a redundant celebration of Pitch Perfects own success. Where previous conflicts were both inherently musical and organically related to character--as well as versions of femininity the Bellas sorority prissiness versus Becas too-cool facade--here they mostly spring from an accident. With one exception the subplot about Becas internship at a record studio under a domineering producer played snappily by Keegan-Michael Key of Key and Peele. He points out that all shes made are mashups rather than original productions--a point that ends up reflecting back on the limitations of a cappella itself. Even if the conflict depends on a rather aesthetically retrograde definition of originality its the most successful illumination of the films theme of growing up a reprise of Becas tendency to go it alone rather than reach out for support. Its also a missed chance. Instead of some trumped-up contest in Copenhagen the whole movie could have been about these young musicians at the pinnacle of their cosseted field taking on the professional entertainment business and attempting to cross the very real barrier that separates novelty acts from legitimacy. Thats a struggle with authentic stakes and risks raising issues of musical value that this movie only lightly brushes. Advertisement Of course there are still plenty of pleasant musical set pieces mostly variations on ideas from the first film; thats a sequels obligation and Im not mad at it. (I was happy to hear some contemporary country in particular with Beca sizzling on Carrie Underwoods ""Before He Cheats."") But the process of generating those moments is less lingered-over and loved. When we see all the a cappella groups getting together for a party for instance recorded music plays in the background. No singing? What happened to our aca-addicts? Wilson does have one stellar sequence both musically and comically built around Pat Benatars ""We Belong"" a van and a rowboat yet near-blasphemously its all set to a backing track rather than her comrades oral orchestrations. So a cappella is at once overpampered here and taken too much for granted. The new ingenue character taking the audience-POV place of Beca from the first movie and played by Hailee Steinfeld is nicknamed ""Legacy"" because her mom was a Bella. Rather than incarnate our dubiousness as Beca did though she represents starry-eyed Pitch Perfect fandom. Like Beca she turns out to bring something extra and special but she plays far too easy to get and thats how Pitch Perfect 2 treats both its viewers and its subject matter--including pop music itself the first films true and elusive heart. This sequel succumbs to a predictable syndrome and goes big when it should have gone home. Its self-satisfaction is a step toward cynicism and that is what a Pitch Perfect film must never be. Top Comment I dont really care about this movie and have no plans to see it (I grew out of ""underdog"" movies of this ilk in middle school) but one part of the review really stuck in my proverbial craw ""Instead...  More... -SirWired Join In All that said will I see it again and would I watch a third installment? No doubt. This is a story like most outsider tales about a chosen family--and although we use that phrase the truth is often its the family that chooses you. Pitch Perfect had me at do-re-mi from that day on pay-per-view forward for better for worse in franchise sickness and in franchise health.

In Pitch Perfect 2 the Barden Bellas seek a world a cappella title.(Richard Cartwright/2015 Universal Studios) REVIEW Pitch Perfect 2 The Barden Bellas are back with an encore-worthy sequel Add to ... Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 15 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 15 2015 1129AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Elizabeth Banks Written by Kay Cannon Starring Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson Hailee Steinfeld Brittany Snow John Michael Higgins Elizabeth Banks Classification PG Genre comedy Country USA Language English Competitive a cappella groups score points for snazzy reinventions of the recognizable but sequels rarely try for such innovation. And so Pitch Perfect 2 the sparky enough follow-up to the surprise musical comedy from 2012 doesnt stray from the original. What we have is an update that is tighter slicker and fine-tuned in more ways than one - no doubt music to the ears of the fans of a flowering franchise. The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way Crass zingers fly songs have more verve and a-ca-casionally familiar characters show growth. And by growth were not talking about Fat Amys expansion.Then again we are. Although Anna Kendricks Beca is again the lead here (as the chief arranger for Barden Bellas an all-girl college a cappella group) Rebel Wilsons sassy Fat Amy fills up more screen time. In fact she shows way too much in the sequels opening moments descending from the rafters during a Kennedy Center performance. The wardrobe malfunction leaves no wonder to the Aussies ""down under"" and the Obamas in the private box - stock first couple footage is used - are left wincing from the vaginal mishap.The Bellas who snagged a national championship in Pitch Perfect as freshmen are now seniors and three-time defenders. As a result of Amys unfortunate exposure however the troupe is thrown off a victors tour with no chance for a fourth straight title.As soundtrack choices are mindful of the storyline the downturn of the Bellas is accompanied by Mikas bouncy Lollipop hit from 2007 about trying too hard and ultimately being let down. But the girls are not flat for long. Stripped of their national tiara they decide to shoot for a world title instead.And theres your narrative skimpier than a Beyonce gown and so standard redemption twee-glee style. (Or Rocky style The lead singer of German antagonists Das Sound Machine is a female Ivan Drago albeit one whose intimidating sexuality unnerves Beca to humorous ends.)The way back to respectability is a road of fun. We have plenty of one-joke characters and theres Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins back as the pithy broadcasters. Higgins - who knows his way around Christopher Guest-mode comedy and whose Owner of a Lonely Heart dinner-table performance in The Break-up gets a big ""yes"" as the greatest a cappella moment in cinematic history - is particularly hilarious as the riotously racist and merrily misogynistic commentator. He sees the successful all-gal glee clubbers as an ""inspiration to all girls across the country who are too ugly to be cheerleaders.""Banks who also makes her feature directorial debut here is strictly second banana. Shes also unadventurous behind the camera. A trip to Copenhagen for an outdoor festival - A Cachella perhaps? - is dealt with dismissively.But make way for the clumsy underclassman Emily played by Hailee Steinfeld (all grown up from True Grit). She ushers in a new sensibility - original songs instead of covers - and finds a willing collaborator in Beca an aspiring music producer looking for a voice of her own. Likewise the rest of the harmony-happy graduating class considers its next steps too.As for the film it doesnt try too hard to distinguish itself from its predecessor hitting the notes it needs to hit while pushing a girl-power - we hear Beyonces Run the World (Girls) - agenda. Although it works well as an encore the likelihood is that this thing isnt over until the Fat Amy zings again.

""Pitch Perfect 2"" simply decides to party instead.Luckily these are wonderful characters to party with for the most part. This is a basic girls-just-want-to-have-fun-while-supporting-sisterhood movie that never once backs off its feminist empowerment message and it brings smile after smile. You just wish there was a bit more going on in the story department.About that department The Barden Bellas those cheeky college girls who just want to ""make music with their mouths"" have become three-time national a cappella champions under the guidance of spunky would-be music producer Becca (the indefatigable Anna Kendrick). But then in a command performance before President Barack Obama Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) suffers a lower hemisphere wardrobe malfunction that eventually finds the Bellas banned from competing nationally.So to win back credibility the Bellas decide to compete in the world a capella championship (is there such a thing?). But to do so they will have to regroup and rebond. Can they do it?Meanwhile Becca has landed an internship working for a major record producer (Keegan-Michael Key) who recognizes her talent but scoffs at the mash-up demos she gives him as not being original work. Luckily a new student (Hailee Steinfeld) who dabbles in songwriting has just joined the Bellas.Early on were introduced to the Bellas chief competitors for the world title a black-clad Samp;M-themed German group that seems to function with all the precision and heart of a BMW. The Germans are scary-cute -- for a minute. Then they become wearisome overkill.If theres a serious lack to ""Pitch Perfect 2"" -- aside from a complex story line -- its in the friendly competition the Bellas had with their on campus rivals the all-male Treblemakers which sparked some great performances and friendships. Here the Treblemakers are mostly background.Director (and co-star) Elizabeth Banks is dealing with some valid apprehensions here -- the fear of having to actually strike out on your own and the challenge of finding your unique voice. And so its natural (and predictable) that the Bellas should end the film singing an original song that wins the day.The problem is that song is instantly forgettable and offers none of the choreographic possibilities that Beccas mash-ups had. As a result the grand finale isnt all that grand. Perhaps finding ones own voice isnt all its cracked up to be.Still the girls have stood up for themselves and the pillow fights along the way are fluffy fun indeed. Rebel Wilson is given more comic space here and she puts it to good use a new immigrant Bella (Chrissie Fit) gets some good lines and if a couple of other new Bellas are indistinguishable well thats fodder for laughs as well.The result is a movie with attitude and energy thats not as aca-amazing as the original but still makes for semi-shiny summertime fun.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongPitch Perfect 2GRADE C+Rated PG-13 for innuendo and languageRunning time 115 minutes 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1Hkdn5Y MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/05/15/movie-review-shaky-pitch-perfect-hits-high-notes/27332081/,200,pitchperfect210,pitchperfect2,detroitnews

(Richard Cartwright / Associated Press) Betsy Sharkey The comedy choir wars are more intense more absurd more low-brow fun than ever in Pitch Perfect 2 The comedy choir wars are more intense more absurd and more lowbrow fun than ever in ""Pitch Perfect 2."" It is almost impossible not to be amused by the cutthroat world of competitive a cappella.Watching the international battle royale that is at the heart of the ""Pitch Perfect"" sequel the feints and jabs and trash talking are certainly more entertaining than say the recent Mayweather-Pacquiao match. Yawn. The new ""Pitch"" is still securely anchored by Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson and Brittany Snow who portray the defining members of the top-ranked college a cappella group the Barden Bellas. Hailee Steinfeld proves a very good addition to the chorus line and her Emily is key to freshening up a fairly predictable plot.Basically for the Bellas life may be lyrical but it is also a constant cycle of fighting their way back from some kind of terrible mess. In ""2"" screenwriter Kay Cannon lets them start on a high note. The Bellas are the reigning national champions and as such Beca (Kendrick) Chloe (Snow) and the rest are performing as part of a birthday celebration for President Obama. It is all razzle-dazzle until an aerial silk segment by Fat Amy (Wilson) ends in a pants-splitting overexposure. Providing the play-by-play of that debacle and more are the a cappella pundits John and Gail played John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks both excellent snipers and fully loaded with caustic lines. A word-of-mouth hit? The perfect pitch for Pitch Perfect 2 Amy Kaufman ""Im gonna really embarrass myself here"" Howard Stern cautioned his satellite radio listeners. ""But I watched Pitch Perfect and I liked it."" That 2012 comedy about a female a cappella group beloved by teenage girls? It was the shock jocks guilty pleasure. Universal Pictures executives giddily... ""Im gonna really embarrass myself here"" Howard Stern cautioned his satellite radio listeners. ""But I watched Pitch Perfect and I liked it."" That 2012 comedy about a female a cappella group beloved by teenage girls? It was the shock jocks guilty pleasure. Universal Pictures executives giddily... (Amy Kaufman) Speaking of Banks it was a smart move for the studio to let her slip into the directors chair too. She and her producing partner-spouse Max Handelman have been guiding forces in the surprise musical hit from the beginning. But certainly for Banks her behind-the-camera role in ""2"" takes her impact to a new level.It is an impressive feature directing debut with Banks handling the high-octane chaos of ""Pitch"" with almost perfect aplomb. She sets a fast pace that is definitely needed to keep this kind of zany piece afloat. And though there are any number of scenes that call for humiliation and the film is certainly not shy about poking fun at stereotypes there is something comically apologetic in the way Banks goes about it that makes the offenses easier to take. Anna Kendrick in Pitch 2 Richard Cartwright / Associated Press Anna Kendrick as Beca in a scene from ""Pitch Perfect 2."" Anna Kendrick as Beca in a scene from ""Pitch Perfect 2."" (Richard Cartwright / Associated Press) The film catches the Bellas at a major transitional point. Most of the groups members are going to be graduating -- even Chloe who has delayed her departure for many years since the Bellas are her life her identity. Its not that ""Pitch"" goes deep but it does in these offhand ways weave in some of the issues facing college grads. One of the major ones is Becas divided loyalties. Part of her is still very much invested in the Bellas her creativity much of the reason for the groups success. But shes also got an internship at a recording studio the first step in her dream of being a music producer.Besides representing one of the films flashpoints the recording studio also provides a nice-sized stage for the very funny ""Key and Peel"" star Keegan-Michael Key (whom I first came to admire in ""MADtv"") to have some fun as Becas acerbic boss.Steinfelds Emily enters the picture as a new freshman whose mother (Katey Sagal) was a famous Bella. That legacy status fast-tracks her acceptance in the group while her style -- she writes original music gasp -- creates controversy.The narrative follows the Bellas as they try to redeem their rep by winning the world competition. There are many bumps on the road to the fateful face-off in Copenhagen. The enemy is a German group led by Kommissar (Birgitte Hjort Sorensen) and Pieter (Flula Borg) a duo so tightly wound you fear they might come completely unhinged.There are romantic intrigues for Beca Fat Amy and Emily -- sweet singing guys played by Skylar Astin Adam DeVine and Ben Platt. But really its all about the music. The versatile Mark Mothersbaugh whose credits include many of Wes Andersons films was in charge of the music.""Pitch Perfect 2s"" song sheet is extensive and playful. Aakomon Jones choreography is elaborate. And the underground a cappella slam called the Rip-Off hosted by a caftan-clad David Cross might be the most memorable in the movie. Jim Denault is director of photography Toby Corbett production designer Salvador Perez Jr. costume designer.Kendrick continues to prove her comic and singing chops -- her musical credits keep expanding with her ""Into the Woods"" Cinderella among the more recent. Wilsons ""Im fat get over it"" shtick gets more screen time in ""2"" and is still funny -- for now.Steinfeld continues to turn up in the strangest places as she moves beyond her ""True Grit"" breakthrough. Shes charming in ""Pitch"" which serves quite nicely while she finds her way to perfect.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com------------Pitch Perfect 2MPAA rating PG-13 for innuendo and languageRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Entertainment Movies Elizabeth Banks Hailee Steinfeld Anna Kendrick Pitch Perfect 2 Anna Kendrick plays Egg Russian Roulette loves motivational tweet posters Aca-awesome Pitch Perfect 2 premiere draws hordes of fans Rebel Wilson scales new heights in Pitch Perfect 2 Aca-awesome Pitch Perfect 2 premiere draws hordes of fans Anna Kendrick plays Egg Russian Roulette loves motivational tweet posters Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-pitch-perfect-2-20150515-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,pitchperfect211,pitchperfect2,latimes
"Blah Cappella The Mess and Minor Insult of Pitch Perfect 2 << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Blah Cappella The Mess and Minor Insult of Pitch Perfect 2 Universal Pictures Movies May 14 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print The appeal of 2012s Pitch Perfect had everything to do with Anna Kendrick. She was a cool kind-of-uptight Alice in the nerdy earnest cutthroat Wonderland of competitive a cappella singing. Kendrick radiates intelligence without making it seem like a safety hazard the way it always appears to be with Jodie Foster. Some of what that intelligence suggests is that she isnt a joiner -- of sororities of singing groups and certainly not of singing groups that are basically sororities. You didnt think Kendrick would even bother to sing. But theres a moment in the first Pitch Perfect during a riff-off battle in which Kendrick leads the charge against a bunch of boys with a snarling version of ""No Diggity."" Her pretty birdlike voice flashes a couple of talons. It was like watching hoop-skirt Sandy become leather-pants Sandy for the last number in Grease. Summer Movies 2015 Rex n FX The Charming Jurassic World How Hollywood Grows New Spielbergs Killing It Spy and Sharing Comedic Wealth; Plus the Masturbatory Entourage Mad Max As Hell The Masterful Maniacal Surprisingly Feminist Fury Road Blah Cappella The Mess and Minor Insult of Pitch Perfect 2 Nerd Plus Ultron There Has to Be More to Avengers Age of Ultron Than Printing More Money All of our summer movie content Kendricks character Beca turned out to be a nerd too -- her musical superpower was doing mash-ups two or three songs become one. It was a specialty that gave her group the Bellas the winning edge. That first movie was a confusion of ideas one of those charmers that also indulged an urge to be gross and brazenly offensive because there was still some novelty in it. The musical numbers were as messy as they always are in musicals now whether were talking about Glee or any of Rob Marshalls Vitamix smoothies. But the actors sold the mess -- especially Skylar Astin and boys who had names like Benji and Bumper. I actually left that movie thinking that Astin whos got the shameless sense of showbiz that is college a cappella could be a star. He got a show on TBS instead. This is all to say that Im not sure that movie needed an encore. Or Im not sure how youd pull one off since most of the actors looked too old to be freshmen in the first round. So when you see Kendrick in Pitch Perfect 2 she seems like such an adult that the only explanation for her being a college senior is that this is actually 26 Jump Street. The cool is gone. One of the groups new members (Hailee Steinfeld) is an annoyingly earnest legacy Bella who just ... cant ... wait to rush. Thats telling Whats missing from this movie aside from music (the numbers are so thin they feel scarce) is the arc of self-discovery. Kendrick seems ready for adult parts (shes 29) but the plot treats her like an ingenue. Beca secretly focuses on a record-label internship that interferes with her innovations for the Bellas repertoire. But at the label she gets to surprise everybody with her flair for mash-ups all over again. These scenes feature Snoop Dogg playing himself and recording a Christmas album (for him Beca mashes up ""Winter Wonderland"" and ""Here Comes Santa Claus""). The best part of the internship is Keegan-Michael Key who plays Becas flamboyantly unimpressed boss. He could take over for any of the characters on Empire -- or all of them -- and sling that show further into the ionosphere. In the meantime theres the other plot in which the color commentators played by Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins tell the Bellas that the group has been barred from the international a cappella federation (or whatever it is) because Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) has a wardrobe malfunction at the Kennedy Center during a birthday performance for President Obama. The international overreaction -- from Jake Tapper to hate mail from Sonia Sotomayor -- is good and absurd. The rest of the movie is chaotic and random (Kay Cannon the 30 Rock veteran wrote both installments; Banks directed this one). The group can get its good name back by toppling a hydraulic German outfit -- Das Sound Machine -- and winning the world championships in Copenhagen. But the movie is in no hurry to get there and barely feels compelled to bother with drama. The party sequences have neither a point nor any life. The big sing-off in the commercials takes place in the dungeon of a rich weird deep-fried a cappella fanatic played by David Cross. He introduces a category (Song About Butts; I Dated John Mayer) and the assembled groups including the Bellas the Green Bay Packers and a bunch of comedians (Reggie Watts and Jason Jones). This sequence doesnt not work but the arrangements themselves never build to any kind of excitement. And as in the finale theres no interest in surprising us even a little bit. The 90s hip-hop segment is an aural traffic jam. (I have to ask how we can still call this a cappella singing when the soundtrack pumps beats into almost every number.) Astin has nothing to do this time but be Kendricks kickstand. The guys playing Bumper and Benji (Adam DeVine and Ben Platt) get to flirt with Wilson and Steinfeld but DeVine and Wilson are just taking their shtick from the first movie out of the microwave. These two do somehow produce the movies one memorable musical moment which involves a canoe and Pat Benatars best song. That moment is special because its the only one in which singing seems to function as an organic mode of communication The lyrics mean something and theyre somewhat meaningfully sung. Its like watching one Muppet attempt to win back another. Why not build in more of those? Why not let Kendrick have more musical time to herself? Why keep her as flustered and unsure as she is here? With these two movies her portrayal of Cinderella in Into the Woods and a couple of lovely moments with Jake Gyllenhaal in End of Watch theres now a not-unreasonable expectation that Kendrick should be singing and dancing more. Shes not the greatest at either but she works as a musical star. All her thinking makes her stand out. Instead the filmmakers chase dumb gags and tell limp jokes. The movie invites you to celebrate its diversity. The Bellas are indeed not all white. But none of the characters of color has been promoted to do more than act like a weirdo. The other new addition besides Steinfeld is a Guatemalan named Flo (Chrissie Fit) who caps every exchange with a tale of poor-migrant suffering. Hana Mae Lee returns as the mousy Japanese girl Lilly with no scatological boundaries. The songwriter and producer Ester Dean plays the black girl and lesbian who when she isnt flirting aggressively actually has to quip ""What kind of white shit is this?"" Asking a question like that in a film about a cappella singing is like working in a barn and complaining about the hay. The movie might think this is a continuation of the very funny racism and sexism that Higgins gets to deliver and Banks seated beside him either wearily pooh-poohs or cosigns. But their bigotry is a satire on color commentary. With Fit Lee and Dean the jokes themselves are their race and sexual orientation. Whats supposed to be funny about Fat Amy is there in the name but she gets a man most of the good dialogue and a couple of plot lines. Even Steinfeld arrives fully developed with a love interest and her character gets to write the awful ballad that Beca produces and that helps turn the judges heads at worlds. The song is called ""Flashlight."" Cannon couldve used one to find something for the nonwhite characters to do besides act comically colored.

Director Elizabeth Banks (155). PG-13. Area theaters. It looks like the first ""Pitch Perfect"" (2012) was a one-hit wonder. Like many of the musical artists whose songs are covered the series has suffered a slump with its second outing. ""Pitch Perfect 2"" plays the notes but not the music. Set three years after the events of the first movie the sequel finds collegiate a cappella group the Barden Bellas riding high on their third win as national champions. However their victory lap is cut short when Amy (Rebel Wilson) suffers a wardrobe malfunction while performing for of all people the U.S. President. Facing suspension the team has one option win the international championship. But can they win if Becca (Anna Kendrick) is devoting too much time to her new internship? And how will newcomer Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) fare in her trial by fire? ""Pitch Perfect 2"" follows the same template as part one but its unmemorable. The highlights again are the a cappella covers of various pop songs but there are fewer of them and the performances arent as strong. From left Hailee Steinfeld Anna Kendrick Brittany Snow Alexis Knapp and Rebel Wilson in Pitch Perfect 2. (Richard Cartwright) Anna Kendrick stars in ""Pitch Perfect 2."" (Richard Cartwright) Rebel Wilson suffers a wardrobe breakdown in Pitch Perfect 2. (Richard Cartwright) Those musical numbers are bridged by disconnected subplots that service too many characters with off-key results. Every quirky supporting character gets a romance. Major returning characters like Brittany Snows scene-stealing group leader Chloe get pushed to the sidelines. The film doesnt tell a story as much as it wallows in diversions until it finds a place to stop. Although co-star Elizabeth Banks making her feature directorial debut does a serviceable job behind the camera original director Jason Moores sly style and brisk pacing are missed. More of an issue is the films mean streak While ""Pitch Perfect"" had a snarky side its sequel is awfully cruel for a series that prides itself on inclusion girl power and open-mindedness. Hard-core fans of the first film may not mind. But even for them it may feel like a reunion tour of a favorite band You just have to grit your teeth and remember the good ol days.

Richard Cartwright/Universal Studios hide caption toggle caption Richard Cartwright/Universal Studios Chloe (Brittany Snow) Flo (Chrissie Fit) Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) Beca (Anna Kendrick) Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) and Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) are the Barden Bellas in Pitch Perfect 2. Richard Cartwright/Universal Studios Somethings different about these Bellas. Three years ago the Anna Kendrick-led all-female a cappella group won the hearts of music nerds everywhere in the college comedy Pitch Perfect. Now theyre flashing the president at the Kennedy Center. Thats what happens at the end of the opening number to Pitch Perfect 2 when in the middle of a group mashup of pop songs from the past few years Bella breakout Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson the franchises proudly plus-size scene-stealer) descends from the rafters singing Miley Cyrus ""Wrecking Ball"" as her costume bursts open. The Obamas or stock footage of the Obamas anyway look on in horror. Then theres a follow-up montage of famous newscasters tsk-tsking Fat Amy. By this point fans of the surprise hit first film may be wondering if theyre witnessing the Aca-pocalypse. What happened to the perceptive relatively low-key college comedy that cared about nail detail and reveled in the simple thrill of vocal remixes? The effortless charms of Kendrick Wilson and top-notch bit players like Brittany Snow and Adam DeVine now play second fiddle to so much shock humor and extended celebrity cameos that a Saturday Night Live parody would feel redundant. Elizabeth Banks who has produced both films in the series and offers running commentary with John Michael Higgins as one-half of the collegiate a cappella societys obsessive playcallers directed this sequel. Despite so much returning talent (the film also shares the same screenwriter in Kay Cannon) Pitch Perfect 2 is singing a completely different tune from the 2012 original. And the notes are feeling a bit overproduced. If the films opener is rough it soon picks up again. Though the Bellas have been stripped of their U.S. championship status replaced at gigs by an electropop-loving German group clad in all black a loophole in the amusingly byzantine a cappella bylaws grants them the right to compete for a global trophy at an international vocal competition. While her group is training Beca the aspiring DJ portrayed so winningly by Kendrick goes to intern for a conceited record producer (the hilarious Keegan Michael Key) who swears at his hipster underlings. Beca cant bring herself to tell the other Bellas shes thinking about something besides them just as Fat Amy cant bear to admit her feelings for lovestruck Bumper (DeVine) who once headed the rival all-male singing group but now works campus security as a post-grad. And a Bella newcomer the legacy member Emily (a crushingly enthusiastic Hailee Steinfeld) is desperate to live up to the groups lofty ideals. When Emily who will surely take over the franchise should there be a Pitch Perfect 3 begins to have doubts about her place in the group Fat Amy reassures her ""You are one of us. You paid the registration fee."" There are still fun vocal numbers though since the first Pitch Perfect was such an unexpected hit -- cool young women slinging tunes can carry a movie without male leads who knew? -- this one has the puppetry of studio heads trying to apply corporate synergy to a formula theyve only just discovered. Fans of the first movie remember the ""riff-off"" song battle held in secret in a dark corner of campus. So here it is again except more expensive and including an extended role for the Green Bay Packers. (The battle orchestrated by an eccentric wealthy a cappella fan played by David Cross and filled with famous faces now resembles the fantastical cameo-stuffed fights from the Anchorman movies.) Meanwhile Latinos are a growing market so heres Flo (Chrissie Fit) a Guatemalan Bella whose only lines are jokes about her legal status. In addition to being an unfunny one-note stereotype Flo also drives home one of the franchises weakest continuing points the lack of a true interpersonal relationship between the Bellas though their sisterhood is supposed to be the emotional center of the series. As in the first film there are running jokes about how no one understands the low talker (Hana Mae Lee) and about the interchangeability of the lesser members. The group feels like one of those hierarchy-obsessed cliques Mean Girls warned us about. Well hey as long as theres all this singing going on why not try to sell an original song? A new generic pop ditty called ""Flashlight"" appears several times supposedly written by Emily but actually penned by Sia Sam Smith Jason Moore and Christian Guzman (and performed by Jessie J on the soundtrack). Theres a running joke about how a cappella is no place for originals -- but isnt that kind of true? One of the genres chief appeals is how it uses rearranged harmonies and raw group effort to give new life to old favorites. Its a skill that in the wake of Pitch Perfect 2s muddled attempt to recapture a familiar beat looks that much harder to pull off. ""Flashlight"" May 15 2015 This review originally misstated that Jessie J wrote the song ""Flashlight."" She performs it on the soundtrack but it was written by Sia Sam Smith Jason Moore and Christian Guzman.

In 2012 the celebration/spoof of a cappella college groups Pitch Perfect managed to preserve it thanks mostly to the light touch of star Anna Kendrick. But the grim arithmetic of sequels demands more of what worked the first time more camp more sincerity. Charm doesnt stand a chance. Crassness on the other hand holds up nicely. Some of it is gleefully offensive some of it is funny some of it is boringly gratuitous. Whatever you may be too numb from the moreness to notice much. Anyway in this installment the Barden Bellas get booted thanks to a wardrobe malfunction and must find a way to win their way back in at the World Championships. Narrative logic would suggest that they get some help from the new girl (the film seems largely uninterested in most of the originals) but but...she writes her own songs 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Although this sequel cant quite capture the magic of the first movie Pitch Perfect 2 is a pleasant undertaking and fans of the first film will want to see this second chapter. The winning college a cappella group The Barden Bellas continues to triumph in competition. Led by Beca (Anna Kendrick) and Chloe (Brittany Snow) the women seem unbeatable but then a ludicrous mishap puts the singers in hot water. (How ludicrous? Fat Amy the character played by Rebel Wilson is essentially without knickers in front of the President.) The Barden Bellas are banned from competition. The women have devoted themselves to the Bellas and they take the news hard. Luckily theres redemption in sight. The Bellas are not prevented from competing in an international a cappella championship and if they win all is forgiven. Thing is no U.S. a cappella group has ever won the world championship before. The Bellas are confident they can triumph over adversity and win the big contest at least until they go out to see their competition a spectacular German group called Das Sound Machine. How can The Bellas ever hope to win? (A Practise man practise) A fable about friendship team work and harmony Pitch Perfect 2 has a slim story buoyed by various subplots. One such secondary tale is Fat Amys possible romance with Bumper (Adam DeVine); another is Becas internship at a recording studio with a famous producer. Then theres the newbie story that has Hailee Steinfeld playing Emily a freshman keen to join the Bellas. Her mom (Katey Sagal) was a Bella and Emily just wants to continue the tradition. The film doesnt always connect the dots but the various components are fun to watch even if they dont quite meld. Elizabeth Banks making her feature directorial debut here has just the light touch the material requires -- never underlining either the comedy or the more heartfelt material. And shes fearless with the daft stuff. Theres a crazed singing competition that involves the Green Bay Packers a Christmas recording session with Snoop Dogg and the ongoing surreal hilarious commentary from Banks and John Michael Higgins who return in their roles as a cappella contest commentators. Pitch Perfect 2 is sweet predictable story but its shored up by some hilarious and absurd action on the sidelines. The inclusion of Hailee Steinfeld in this sequel moves the story forward as required so dont be surprised to see the Bellas back again next year in Part 3.

"Pitch Perfect 2 an imperfect sequel review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPitch Perfect 2 an imperfect sequel reviewBut the songs and production numbers are just as fun and energetic as in the original making this a worthy double bill for fans.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. May 14 2015Pitch Perfect 2Starring Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson and Hailee Steinfeld. Directed by Elizabeth Banks. 115 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. PGDid someone say ""encore?""Because three years after Pitch Perfect got audiences laughing and tapping toes to the a cappella beat here comes the sequel.Article Continued BelowIt surely didnt hurt that the original created an unexpected splash at the box office earning more than 100 million worldwide.From left Shelley Regner Hana Mae Lee Brittany Snow Alexis Knapp Anna Kendrick Chrissie Fit Rebel Wilson and Kelley Alice Jakle in Pitch Perfect 2.  (Richard Cartwright / Universal Pictures)  Anna Kendrick is the still appealing star at the centre of Pitch Perfect 2.  (Richard Cartwright / Universal)  But in the cinematic age of serial sequels Pitch Perfect 2 feels less like an homage to the original than an opportunity to exploit its dedicated fan base. The same ribald and politically incorrect comic sensibility is there and there are plenty of familiar faces along with a couple of new ones. But the film never quite rises to the level of the original in terms of consistency and overall fun.The film opens three years after the first with Beca (Anna Kendrick) and most of the other Barden Bellas poised to graduate. Theyve won the national college a cappella championships three years in a row.But just as in the original -- when a stage mishap subjects the group to ridicule and shame -- the Bellas find themselves in the soup again when Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) going commando has a wardrobe malfunction during a command performance for the U.S. President. (Stock footage of Barack Obama looking suitably appalled is provided.)After the Bellas are suspended by the university the young ladies are determined to be redeem themselves by becoming the first U.S. team to win the international championship.They soon meet their main competition a group of arrogant German ""Deutsch-bags"" called Das Sound Machine whose obnoxiousness calls for a karmic comeuppance.Theres also a subplot involving Becas determination to become a music producer that involves a cameo by rapper Snoop Dogg recording an album of Christmas music. It should be much funnier than it actually is.Thats emblematic of the problem throughout laughs that dont quite hit their mark and plotlines that take us nowhere.Sure Rebel Wilson gets more screen time but Fat Amys relationship with the bumptious Bumper (Adam DeVine) seems an annoying contrivance.Theres a couple of new characters including Chrissie Fit as Flo Fuentes a Mexican-American who spouts stereotypes that are sure to offend and Hailee Steinfeld as ""legacy"" newcomer Emily Junk who tries hard to be likeable and fresh and never quite succeeds.The pixie-ish Kendrick is as always a strong and appealing protagonist but her relationship with Jesse (Skylar Astin) doesnt seem to have matured much over three years.Colour commentators John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks) who provided big laughs in the original are also back. But the off-hand racism and misogyny spouted by them and others push the envelope to the limit.Screenwriter Kay Cannon who penned the original falls short this time but its first-time feature director Elizabeth Banks who bears much of the responsibility for the underwhelming-yet-passable sequel.There are just too many moments when jokes fail to ignite and Banks answer seems to be ""throw in another song."" And yes if anything rescues Pitch Perfect 2 its the production numbers that are as droll energetic and just plain fun as in the original.Will any of the songs -- including a catchy original composition -- match the massive viral popularity of ""Cups"" from the first?

Photo Credit Richard Cartwright advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT After a humiliating debacle a cappella champions the Barden Bellas attempt to mount a comeback. Rated PG-13 (crude humor language mild sexuality). BOTTOM LINE Inspired musical numbers an uninvested Kendrick and too many ethnic jokes make this comedy a mixed bag. CAST Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson Hailee Steinfeld LENGTH 150 In the summer of 2012 the comedy ""Pitch Perfect"" demonstrated a finely tuned cultural ear. The story of a college womens a cappella group hit all the right notes a bit of ""Glee"" a lot of female empowerment and two rising stars in Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson. Thanks also to some cool choreography and sparkling arrangements of popular songs ""Pitch Perfect"" became a 65 million hit. For ""Pitch Perfect 2"" Elizabeth Banks is in the directors chair and she also reprises her role as Gail a vapid radio host. Like the original ""Pitch Perfect 2"" can be sunny goofy fun. Oddly though this sequels mean-spirited ethnic jokes can also sound culturally tone-deaf. advertisement | advertise on newsday The movies setting is still Barden University and Kendrick returns as Beca star of the singing Barden Bellas. Theyve suffered another public humiliation this time thanks to Fat Amy (Wilson) who suffers a wardrobe malfunction while performing for the Obamas. A new addition Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) just might be the Bellas secret weapon against a lockstep German group Das Sound Machine (led by Flula Borg and Birgitte Hjort Sarensen). The movie has its inspired moments as when a secret underground contest draws the Tone Hangers (whose members include comedians Reggie Watts and John Hodgman) and several actual Green Bay Packers. Kendricks Beca is distracted by an internship at a recording studio but Wilsons Fat Amy steps up to the plate with one-liners slapstick and some endearing scenes with her beau Bumper (Adam DeVine). The rest of the returning cast including Skylar Astin Anna Camp and Hana Mae Lee fight for screen time. Most of the ethnic jokes come from John Michael Higgins as a Stephen Colbert-ish radio host. He is meant to satirize old white America but ends up representing it. ""There they go"" he says of an Indian singing group ""running offstage to take some more of our jobs."" A new Bella named Flo (Chrissie Fit) talks only about the grinding poverty of her native Guatemala. Eventually we learn she will likely be deported easily the films most callous wisecrack. MoviesBig movies out this summer Its a shame ""Pitch Perfect 2"" strikes these sour notes. As ""American Idol"" host Randy Jackson used to say about wobbly performances its pitchy.

USA TODAYS Claudia Puig tells you whether to Catch It Skip It or Rent it in this weeks edition of The Screening Room. Sean FujiwaraRebel Wilson returns as Fat Amy in the sequel Pitch Perfect 2.(Photo Richard Cartwright Universal Pictures)You have to love a movie about collegiate a cappella singers that references Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. In a bawdy joke.While just a jot less fun than its predecessor Pitch Perfect 2 is a worthy sequel in tone even if the story feels padded with a few too many montages ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).Wise additions to the cast include Keegan-Michael Key hilarious as a music producer working on a Christmas album with Snoop Dogg and Hailee Steinfeld as a sweetly earnest new member of the Bellas singing group.Anna Kendrick is back as sassy Beca the Bellas musical arranger. She also has an internship with the producer and seems to be the only one of the Bella singers thinking about life after graduation.Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy nearly steals the movie with her hilarious version of Pat Benatars We Belong while making her way -- despite a variety of obstacles -- to her would-be boyfriend Bumper (Adam DeVine).Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare The Barden Bellas enter an international a cappella competition which no American team has ever won. VPCThe film opens with the national-champion Bellas performing at Lincoln Center in New York for President Obama. The camera cuts seamlessly to shots of the President and First Lady as appreciative audience members.The girls are singing in typically spirited fashion and all seems harmonious. Then Wilson emerges overhead dangling in an acrobatic act. Within minutes of appearing on stage she splits her spandex. Private parts are revealed for all to see.Cut to the hilarious pairing of a cappella overseers Elizabeth Banks (who also directed and produced the film) and John Michael Higgins each reprising their roles as snarky commentators. Awash in nasty asides they deem the college singers a national disgrace.Higgins character is a clueless male chauvinist who spouts lines such as ""This is what happens when you send girls to college.""A gifted comedian Banks handles the humorous scenes particularly deftly.With one wardrobe malfunction the Bellas are laughingstocks reviled on social media and recipients of hate letters (thats where Sotomayor comes in). Theyre banned from performing nationally.But nothing in the official wording of their punishment says they cant perform overseas. Conveniently the international competition is in Copenhagen.Before they get to Denmark they meet their stiffest competition Germanys super-slick techno-fueled and arrogant Das Sound Machine whom Amy dubs ""Deutschbags.""The plot is thin -- the girls go off to a camp for team-building exercises led by the uptight former Bella leader Aubrey (Anna Camp). Hijinks ensue. Beca is in awe of the DSM leader Kommissar (Birgitte Hjort Sorensen) and when faced with the womans insults Beca can only comment on her beauty and soft skin.But the story is beside the point. Music is the focus. Unfortunately there are fewer memorable musical numbers in this sequel.A funny segment in which a wealthy a cappella enthusiast (David Cross) invites the Bellas DSM and other college singers to a private party results in their being pitted against each other in a contest of musical genres and riffing skills. This might be the musical highlight.An amusing running gag involves new troupe member Flo (Chrissie Fit) a Central American immigrant student. When the girls lament their litany of minor hardships she pipes up with shocking references to her impoverished and imperiled childhood.""When I was 9 years old my brother tried to sell me for a chicken"" she announces.More of an ensemble than the first go-round PP2 is slick and sassy and easy on the ears. 18 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1HjrOHi",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/05/14/pitch-perfect2-review-puig/27294855/,200,pitchperfect221,pitchperfect2,usatoday

Photo Richard Cartwright / Richard Cartwright / Universal Pictures Pitch Perfect 2 is the most delightful movie out there 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Theres nothing like a cappella especially when accompanied by musical instruments. Thats the case in ""Pitch Perfect 2"" and although that makes the a cappella not exactly authentic the movie compensates with a fullness of sound as well as spirit plus an off-kilter sense of humor that keeps the laughs coming. As of today this is the most delightful movie out there. A sequel to the 2012 original about a college group of a cappella singers that wins a national championship the new film shows the groups ambitions widen to include the whole world but with some very funny setbacks along the way. The movies only weakness a small one but it has to be mentioned is a slight sag about two-thirds in when the women go away to camp. For about seven or eight minutes this otherwise energetic movie stands still but sitting through a tiny dead spot is a small price to pay. ""Pitch Perfect 2"" gets off to a flashy start with the ladies performing in Washington D.C. before an audience of bigwigs that includes the president and first lady. As the first couple watches from the balcony the singer known as Fat Amy (played by the shrewd Australian comedian Rebel Wilson) has an epic wardrobe malfunction. This is captured on live television and the group finds itself disgraced with only one path to redemption left -- winning the international championship in Copenhagen. This sequel was directed by Elizabeth Banks who in recent years has shaded her screen personality into something distinct -- zany but contained eccentric but not oblivious someone funny unconventional and aware. ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is a little like that like what Banks has been bringing to the screen lately only this time she is coming at you from all sides through all the characters. Banks herself appears as the snippy diva-ish co-host of an a cappella podcast which gives her a chance to comment on the action. In ""Pitch Perfect 2"" the women are seniors experiencing anxiety about leaving the college nest as well as nostalgia in advance for all theyre leaving behind. Actually thats the one scene in the camp sequence worth salvaging the one in which the women sit in a circle and start missing each other even though theyre all still there. The nostalgia of middle age has got nothing on the nostalgia of youth which is very intense and forms half the basis of F. Scott Fitzgeralds stories. Already these women are starting to go in different directions. Beca (Anna Kendrick) the leader of the group is moonlighting as an intern at a recording studio. The group has admitted an up-and-comer into their ranks a freshman named Emily (Hailee Steinfeld). Come to think of it the audition scene in which Emily is admitted is a bit odd. She doesnt do much and yet they welcome her. Maybe their ears are more trained than the audiences. Or maybe that was the best Steinfeld could do. Along the way almost incidentally and not in any painful sense ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is a musical. (Its a little like ""Glee"" but without the sappy earnestness a difference that makes all the difference.) Theres a terrific scene in a private nightclub in which several a cappella groups -- including the Green Bay Packers -- compete against each other. And the production numbers are great to watch including those of the competition a scary German group that does hip-hop inflected a cappella with cold Teutonic precision. Better still the ending of ""Pitch Perfect 2"" arrives five minutes before its expected about one minute before its desired. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Updated July 30 2016  1153 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Pitch Perfect 2 sings familiar tune By Joe Williams / film critic / joewilliamspost-dispatch.com Joe Williams May 14 2015 (...) Second verse not as good as the first.The 2012 musical ""Pitch Perfect"" coat-tailed on the ""Glee"" phenomenon but it was sufficiently likable and lighthearted to become a sleeper hit in its own right. Three years later TV shows such as ""Glee"" and ""American Idol"" are folding their tents but Universal Studios seems determined to build ""Pitch Perfect"" into a film franchise with staying power.Problem No. 1 is that the talented cast of the first movie played college students who are supposed to graduate. Problem No. 2 is that the single new recruit Hallie Steinfeld as freshman Emily doesnt have the comedy skills of the departing Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson. And Problem No. 3 is that the script is such a shameless repeat of the previous effort it makes ""Blurred Lines"" seem like a bolt of inspiration. All told the movie has about 99 problems but pitch aint one. The ladies can sing and their a cappella renditions of recent and classic pop tunes may be reason enough for the target audience of teen girls to go see it. But anyone older will recognize that ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is guilty of an honor-code violation.Oh and its not very funny either. When the opening gag involves a wardrobe malfunction by Fat Amy (Wilson) in front of the president of the United States weve entered sitcom territory and the movie never rises above it.As punishment the three-time national champion Barden Bellas are disqualified from further competition -- unless they can somehow win the World Cup in Copenhagen against the formidable German team Das Sound Machine. DSMs statuesque leader (Birgitte Hjort Sorensen) causes Beca (Kendrick) to question her own sexuality but like the subplots about Becas job at a recording studio and Amys affair with campus security guard Bumper (Adam DeVine) it doesnt amount to much. The movie is so underwritten that several of the nine Bellas barely even have lines.The film was co-written and directed by Elizabeth Banks and her uncensored-announcer schtick with John Michael Higgins is the most amusing thing in the movie. But competition comedies have been using that gimmick for years. (Just ask Bob Costas.) In the climatic scene the Bellas break protocol by performing something original. Lets hope that the inevitable ""Pitch Perfect 3"" does the same thing.What ""Pitch Perfect 2""  Two stars out of four  Run time 155  Rating PG-13  Content Innuendo and mature language Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson Hailee Steinfeld Elizabeth Banks Joe Williams Pitch Perfect 2 Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The story wont win any awards for originality. Kay Cannons script borrows liberally from the first film a surprise hit in 2012 and the movie is really just a group of sketches strung together. But so was ""Animal House"" and ""Caddyshack"" really and no one complains about them.Thats because the sketches were funny and for the most part so are those in ""Pitch Perfect 2.""Set three years after the original the film finds the Barden Bellas the three-time national a cappella champions. They perform at Lincoln Center for President Obama on his birthday but a wardrobe malfunction involving Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) who isnt wearing underwear turns into a viral disaster.A ruling body -- consisting of the lunatic podcasters and commentators John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks who also directs the film) -- bans the Bellas from further competition. However if the Bellas can dethrone the imposing German group Das Sound Machine for the world a cappella championship they can be reinstated.The only problem No American team has ever won the world championship. ""They hate us"" John gleefully notes in one of his many insane asides. (Higgins role remains a riff on Fred Willards brilliantly clueless commentary in ""Best in Show"" but its a good riff.)Of course to someone as obsessed with the Bellas as Chloe (Brittany Snow) now in her seventh year of college after purposely flunking Russian literature three times its worth a shot.Complicating matters this time around is the internship Beca (Anna Kendrick) has landed at a recording studio working for a multiplatinum producer (Keegan-Michael Key terrific in a small role). She keeps it a secret and it takes time away from her arranging duties but its important to her Alone among the Bellas shes looking to a future after college. The song is almost over she knows and she doesnt want to be caught off guard.Theres also an eager new arrival Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) whose mother (Katey Sagal) also was a Bella.Although Fat Amy gets many of the good lines (""Youre the most talented person I know and Ive met three of the Wiggles"") its Wilsons improvisational skill that shines. We expect that after the first film. But also worth praising is Kendricks delivery. Sure she can sing. But her distracted manner (maybe she wasnt into making a sequel or maybe its just how she plays the character) is perfect for someone transitioning between two phases of her life. Although she isnt the obvious lead this time around shes a delight (again).All the set pieces serve in a way to build toward the finale. The loopiest is an underground a cappella face-off in the basement of a rich weird guy (David Cross born to the role) that includes not just the Bellas Das Sound Machine and the Treblemakers but members of the Green Bay Packers. Why? Who cares? Its funny.So are some of the recurring bits brought back from the first film like the non sequiturs whispered by the aggressively weird Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) ""All my teeth come from other people.""Its refreshing that the women are in charge of their own lives making their own decisions. Romance takes a definite backseat in this film which is more about the women finding their true voices -- and doing so without the help of men. The story plays out more as a journey-is-the-reward piece with a predictable ending (although with a sweet touch).Weve been down this road before. But ""Pitch Perfect 2"" goofier than the original makes it an enjoyable trip.Pitch Perfect 23.5 stars (out of 5) Director Elizabeth Banks.Cast Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson Hailee Steinfeld.Rating PG-13 for innuendo and language.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

""Pitch Perfect"" created a make-believe a cappella singing world where competitions are televised like Super Bowls and filled it with a gawky eight-member team of pretend college girls who never attend class. Meet Fat Amy shes thick around the middle Say hello to Lilly a nerdy Asian named after a regional flower Welcome to One Note College The formula didnt move the musical comedy oeuvre to new heights but with elaborate performance showcases and a smidge of sisterhood empowerment it became a 2012 surprise hit. The follow-up doesnt produce glory but it definitely supplies glee. Once again its the story of a group whose members must improve a stale repertoire if they hope to win a competition. Which is essentially what sequels like this have to do. Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson and the rest of the gang are on top of the world as the sequel opens. National champions for three years the Bellas are invited to entertain the First Family at Kennedy Center. Cut to stock shot of the smiling Obamas seated in a theater. Its a smash until trapeze-riding Amy (Wilson) undergoes a major midair wardrobe malfunction. Cut to frowning Obamas. Barred from further performances the only way the troupe can return to the stage is by winning the upcoming global contest where no American team has ever triumphed. That means they must top the Panzer-like German vocal group Das Sound Machine (headed by Deutsch media star Flula Borg playing his part like a campy Dolph Lundgren in ""Rocky IV""). Theres a symphony of similar one-note humor here. Anyone not born in the U.S.A. (or black or lesbian) is a target for sarcasm. Much of it is delivered spot-on by John Michael Higgins playing the competitions acid-tongued TV commentator and twisted for sharp retorts from co-host Elizabeth Banks who keeps the laughs speeding along in her directing debut. Photos provided by Universal Pictures The Bellas beg for a chance to compete in ""Pitch Perfect 2."" Hailee Steinfeld (""True Grit"") playing a likable newcomer to the group makes a wide-eyed and wonderfully voiced addition. Wilsons character lured into out-and-out romance carries the day beyond Kendricks who pursues a recording studio internship that she keeps hidden from the other Bellas. Theres a roster of giggly surprise appearances by music sports and TV celebrities playing themselves. Better are the ace character roles from comics Keegan-Michael Key as Kendricks boorish boss and David Cross as a batty fan. In the tradition of Marvel Universe sequels theres an end-credit sequence worth hanging around for. It sounds as if we havent heard the final crescendo just yet. colin.covertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Richard Cartwright/Universal Pictures) John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks who also directs are shocked by a Barden Bellas performance in ""Pitch Perfect 2."" (Richard Cartwright/Universal Pictures) Theres a Hollywood recipe for making sequels that you might call the ""Hangover"" technique. Take the same characters that were in the original put them into the same situation tweak slightly then hope moviegoers dont notice -- or at least dont care. The greatest selling point of ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is that it doesnt follow that lazy formula and the result is a comedy that if not always better than the first is certainly more uproarious. Theres only so much you can do with a movie about a capella singing. A competition is a must and ""Pitch Perfect 2"" has one along with all the infectious toe-tapping musicality. But the feature directorial debut from Elizabeth Banks also has a different more bonkers feel than its surprise-hit predecessor. [Elizabeth Banks takes the reins on ""Pitch Perfect 2""] The movie opens with the reigning champions of a capella the Barden Bellas performing at the Kennedy Center for the presidents birthday. What starts as a solid routine takes a surprise turn however when Fat Amy (perpetual scene-stealer Rebel Wilson) suspended above the stage has a wardrobe malfunction. Family-friendly entertainment suddenly turns into a detailed lesson on female anatomy and before you know it the pundits are weighing in on ""Morning Joe."" The Bellas end up banned from the American a capella circuit. Theres a loophole though. If the ladies can win the worldwide a capella tourney in Copenhagen theyll be reinstated. That seems like a long shot -- surprise -- given the stiff competition from Germany the leather-and-mesh-clad electronica-inspired Das Sound Machine. [2015 Summer Movie Guide] ""Pitch Perfect 2"" the sequel to the popular 2012 film about a capella groups starring Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson hits theaters May 15. (Universal) The basic outline may sound familiar but the movie isnt really propelled by the narrative. We know well end up in Denmark eventually and meanwhile there are a lot of random detours inserted solely to provide laughs. Theres the side plot with Beca (Anna Kendrick) getting an internship at a record label inserted so comedian Keegan-Michael Key can do some improv and Snoop Dogg can sing a heartfelt rendition of ""Winter Wonderland."" Theres the team-building nature retreat where bear traps provide slapstick comedy. And theres the secret underground a capella competition where David Cross very nearly runs away with the whole movie playing a rich eccentric music enthusiast who rides around on a scooter and pits the Bellas and Das Sound Machine against ""the pride of Wisconsin"" Clay Matthews and the Green Bay Packers. The winner gets a 42000 gift card to Dave and Busters. And so on. The bizarre humor is much more in line with screenwriter Kay Cannons television work on ""30 Rock"" and ""New Girl"" than with her writing on the original ""Pitch Perfect."" The movie also has a more female-centric point of view relegating most of the guys from the first go-round to bit parts including former lead singer and romantic interest Jesse (Skylar Astin) whose role is now just the supportive boyfriend showing up to ca-caw like a bird to Beca when she takes the stage. (No it doesnt make sense but somehow it works.) Meanwhile new addition Hailee Steinfeld does solid work as Emily Junk a clumsy legacy with a bright future in music. And considering all of the other characters are graduating she may be the only one returning for the almost inevitable ""Pitch Perfect 3."" Normally the prospect of yet another sequel would be depressing. But after the delightfully oddball ""Pitch Perfect 2"" the thought is kind of exciting How much weirder could things at Barden University possibly get? PG-13. At area theaters.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The original Pitch Perfect the little a cappella comedy that could is pure formula underdogs plus competitive performance plus sassy zingers. But apart from a slight self-consciousness concerning its naked desire to become the next Bring It On the filmmakers executed that formula with satisfying rewatch-friendly zeal. A sequel might seem like an opportunity for the movies comic talent to stretch beyond the boundaries of its template. But expanding a movie like Pitch Perfect--at least without shamelessly reprising it--also means leaving behind the comfort of riffing off a formula. Character depth that could pass muster within the framework of a winking college sing-off movie starts to seem a little thin when those same characters are staring down graduation.Pitch Perfect 2 deals with this shift in status quo with a variety of strategies; its at once an encore a postscript and a fresh start. In typical sequel fashion the Bellas of Barden University led by former outsider Beca (Anna Kendrick) are knocked from their champion perch in the opening scene when some choreography involving Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) goes awry during a Kennedy Center performance in front of President Obama (playing himself through stock footage). On cue the Bellas are underdogs again and another plucky freshman (Hailee Steinfeld) enters the fold eager to prove herself. At the same time the movie addresses the fact that the Bellas everyone knows from the first movie are all getting ready to graduate--or in the case of Chloe (Brittany Snow) have long since passed a sensible graduation date intentionally failing to keep singing with her girls. Beca still has her eye on a job in the music industry distracting her from the Bellas training to beat an over-cranked team of intimidating Germans in the world championships (a silly conceit but pretty hilarious that the movie tags Muse and Fall Out Boy songs as the tools of Eurotrash villains).With all of these storylines plus a couple of thankfully underdeveloped romantic subplots returning producer and new director Elizabeth Banks (replacing Jason Moore who stays on as executive producer) scrambles to cover a lot of ground. Without the clean through-line of the original--get the Bellas to nationals--the movie sometimes feels like half a season of Pitch Perfect The Series edited down to feature length explaining several plot turns and location changes via establishing shots overlaid with offscreen dialogue. If the journey between musical and comic set pieces is bumpier though the big sequences themselves often deliver. The first movies underground riff-off medley gets a weirder funnier and no less tuneful follow-up and Wilson has a Pat Benatar-belting scene that edges delightfully toward integrated-musical territory. Kendrick meanwhile hones a sort of Tina Fey Junior routine--a nice fit for a screenplay written by 30 Rocks Kay Cannon especially in a runner about her inability to formulate any nasty rejoinders to the beautiful taunting leader of the Germans. As for the musical performances Banks (who appears again with John Michael Higgins as a pair of Christopher Guest-style goofball commentators) directs them like midrange music videos--which to be fair they pretty much are. Moreover the sequel deserves credit for addressing a number of artistic limitations of the first movies a cappella stylings The over-reliance on covers and novelty mashups the emphasis on choreography over singing and the general myopia of treating a collegiate competition as a life-or-death battle are all questioned rather than reinforced. Banks also maintains the series female focus; here the men are appropriately marginalized basically comic relief pitchers. (Keegan-Michael Key is particularly funny as a music producer.) Shes blessed with a wealth of one-joke characters made surprisingly endearing by their performers cushioning the movie when it makes some abrupt turns into montages and side riffing. Its not as smooth a ride as Pitch Perfect but it doesnt really need to be. If the first film fulfilled its destiny as the kind of movie that viewers can catch on cable from virtually any point and watch through to the end Pitch Perfect 2 may prove better-suited to a slot in an enjoyable round of channel-flipping.

EntertainmentMovies Pitch Perfect 2 Youve heard this song before Originally published May 14 2015 at 1205 am Updated May 13 2015 at 633 pm Anna Kendrick left returns as the leader of an a cappella group in ""Pitch Perfect 2."" Hailee Steinfeld plays a new recruit. (Photo Credit Richard Cartwright) Movie review Fans of ""Pitch Perfect"" -- and they are legion -- might not mind that ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is essentially the same film. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Well how dis-a-ca-ppointing. The a cappella comedy ""Pitch Perfect 2"" though not without its pleasures is pretty much just ""Pitch Perfect"" again with more hair and less screenplay. Once again the Bellas -- Barden Colleges beloved all-female singing ensemble -- must face tough competition this time at the World Championships of A Cappella in Copenhagen. Once again group leader Beca (Anna Kendrick) must bring her budding skills as a music producer into play; once again Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) gets all the off-color dialogue; once again John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks play a pair of commentators who really should watch ""Best in Show"" again. And once again Lilly (Hana Mae Lee looking hilariously panicky) mumbles non sequiturs that are probably pretty funny except you cant hear her over an exuberant audience. And exuberant they will be The 2012 ""Pitch Perfect"" though only a modest hit theatrically found a huge following on VOD and DVD. (Hmm ... since there arent that many a cappella choir members out there could it be perhaps that theres a potential audience for films whose main characters are young women?) That crowds likely to enjoy the new film though they may well note that most of the jokes are the same and were worn thin last time. (Higgins and Banks in particular could have been spliced in from the first film.) A few new faces turn up the ever-charming Hailee Steinfeld (""True Grit"") as a starry-eyed new Bellas recruit; Chrissie Fit as Flo an exchange student from Central America (whose one-note dialogue reflects only that fact). But this is essentially the same song as before -- and almost same verse. As before its great fun to hear the singing watch the choreography (particularly that exhibited by a rather scary German team) and enjoy the camaraderie of the extremely well-coiffed Bellas all of whom are first-rate at bantering and hair-flipping. Next time though can we try another key? Movie Review 1/2   Pitch Perfect 2 with Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson Hailee Steinfeld Brittany Snow Skylar Astin Adam Devine Katey Segal Anna Camp John Michael Higgins Elizabeth Banks. Directed by Banks from a screenplay by Kay Cannon based on the book by Mickey Rapkin. 115 minutes. Rated PG-13 for innuendo and language. Several theaters.

(Richard Cartwright/Universal Pictures via AP)(Credit AP) ""Pitch Perfect"" -- 2012s sleeper hit about an all-female college a cappella team competing for a national championship -- was the smash hit that nobody saw coming. Produced for a paltry 17 million the film turned into a global sensation raking in over 112 million turning Anna Kendrick into a bona fide star and firmly securing its soundtrack a place on the iPods of aca-lytes worldwide. For a musical comedy produced by a woman (Elizabeth Banks) written by a woman (""30 Rock"" alum Kay Cannon) and starring a whole bunch of women (Anna Kendrick Brittany Snow Anna Camp and Rebel Wilson who all returned for the sequel) it also served as proof that a female-centric comedy could do serious damage at the box office even with nary an Avenger in site.Banks slid into the directors chair for ""Pitch Perfect 2"" a larger-than-life sequel whose scale and scope speaks directly to the surprising success of the first. The budget has almost doubled as evidenced by the increasingly elaborate set pieces including a grandiose Coachella-esque final performance. ""Pitch Perfect 2 is just larger in every sense featuring more song-and-dance-numbers more meandering subplots more rapid-fire jokes and visual gags and more out-of-left-field celebrity cameos and it is both better and worse for its aca-xpansion. (By the way the sequel has a lot more aca puns. Consider yourself warned)The setup is basically this Our resident national champs the Barden Bellas are suspended from competition after Rebel Wilsons Fat Amy accidentally has a wardrobe malfunction during a performance for President Obama and the first lady (as you can see the franchises fundamental silliness remains intact). After some slut-shaming from the national news media (a clever little bit of media satire featuring many recognizable talking heads) the group is given an ultimatum The Barden Bellas will be finished for good unless they can win at the world championships in Copenhagen. But in order to do that they will have to beat reigning champs ""Das Sound Machine"" a terrifying group of leather-clad Kraftwerk-esque German caricatures proficient in robot-inspired dance moves and techno-beat boxing. On the way to the World Championships they gain a new member a Bella ""legacy"" searching for her voice (a charming Hailee Steinfeld) Anna Kendricks Beca Mitchell struggles to prove herself at an internship working for a tyrannical record producer (played by Keegan Michael-Key) and the girls cope with adjusting to the prospect of life after college.There are obvious problems with the sequel. In terms of plot its basically just a redux of the first one -- the gang must harness the power of friendship and vocal harmonization in order to redeem themselves after an embarrassing incident -- but with less narrative coherence. Subplots are freely picked up and abandoned. The first movie soared on the charm of Anna Kendricks Beca but our leading lady has been sidelined here at the expense of growing the ensemble so we lose time with our awkward witty audience-proxy in favor of peripheral characters who generally arent all that well developed anyway. The subplots for Becas boyfriend Jesse (Skylar Astin) and his male ""Treble Makers"" are substantially cut down while Rebel Wilsons Fat Amy shtick feels a lot more tired three years later. And while the film maintains the franchises satiric edgy humor -- Banks and John Michael Higgins are especially riotous as a recurring a cappella announcer duo -- many of the jokes feel stilted or even offensive particularly a cringeworthy recurring gag about the Bellas one Latina member. You Might Also Like Yet even when it misfires the movie still pulses with life especially when the female leads are bonding. When the girls go on a group wilderness retreat to ""find their sound"" those scenes are less about plot or character development than the warm feeling of spending quality time with old friends. The musical interludes too are more fun than ever ""Pitch Perfect 2 fills a ""Glee""-shaped hole when it comes to show choir-esque covers of contemporary pop songs expanding its repertoire to include a whopping number of chart-toppers and crowd-pleasers (and yes Beyonce is a feature). One of the best moments comes in the form of a ""riff-off"" thrown by a bathrobe-wearing cappella-fanatic played by David Cross. As the Barden Bellas face off against other groups (including the Greenbay Packers and a Barden alumni group composed of Jason Jones Reggie Watts and others) and cycle through categories from ""songs about butts"" to ""I dated John Mayer"" I found myself giggling with glee at the gorgeous ballsy over-the-top silliness of it. Its a big estrogen-filled foot-stompin booty-shakin a cappella party and I didnt want to leave. If there had been karaoke lyrics running along the bottom of the screen -- a la the ""Frozen"" sing-along -- I would have gladly chimed in (free idea AMC theaters). But just because ""Pitch Perfect 2 doesnt take itself too seriously doesnt mean its not important In an industry where the Bechdel test is much discussed but rarely passed a movie that prioritizes female-on-female interactions and women working together is a rare gem to be savored. The fact that no less than the president and first lady would agree to participate in a shamelessly fun film about girls singing college a cappella speaks to how significant a milestone for women on-screen the whole franchise is. As John Michael Higgins misogynist announcer constantly reminds us sexism is still a pervasive force (as he says dismissively after the Bellas get banned ""The truth is youre just women and youll all be pregnant soon""). When the Barden Bellas come out for their grand finale -- to Beyonces ""Who Run the World? Girls"" of course -- I almost welled up. Because unlike every other major franchise and sequel right now girls actually do run this mother. And thats an aca-complishment. Anna Silman is Salons deputy entertainment editor.

Photo Universal Studios MOVIE REVIEW Pitch Perfect 2 Running time 115 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity crude humor). Any movie that features the Green Bay Packers not to mention babes mud-wrestling and pillow-fighting certainly has guy appeal. But dont worry ladies There are also some things you might like about ""Pitch Perfect 2."" Not as aca-mazing as ""Pitch Perfect"" (which made my 10-best list for 2012) the follow-up should have been cut by 10 or 15 minutes. First-time director Elizabeth Banks (who returns as a snarky announcer) doesnt have the zippy comic timing of the first films helmer Jason Moore. But never mind There are a half-dozen hilarious scenes the Barden Bellas new nemesis is awesomely weird and you could hardly find a more endearing group of college students played by 30-year-old actresses. After a wardrobe malfunction involving Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) losing her pants in front of President Obama the Barden Bellas a cappella singing group fights for reinstatement by competing in the world championship against a German outfit called Das Sound Machine. Flula Borg (left) and Birgitte Hjort Sorensen perform as Das Sound Machine.Photo Universal Studios The Germans look like they came from a techno-future as imagined in 1985 and their she-wolf leader would be intimidating enough even if she werent called Kommissar and played by someone called Birgitte Hjort Sorensen. In the obligatory trash-talk phase of the aca-battle she calls Beca (Anna Kendrick) ""a little elf."" But Beca is so flustered by Kommissars Valkyrie glow that her attempts at insulting the German leader kinda sound more like gushing. The best Beca can do is ""Your sweat smells like cinnamon."" The movie is a little slow to get going but in the second half there are several brilliant set pieces like a secret competition in which those football players have a classic cameo. A camping trip yields not only a great gag featuring a net intended as a bear trap but also an unforgettable solo by Wilson singing a Pat Benatar love song. Fat Amys halting romance with Bumper (Adam DeVine) is sweetly off-kilter and ""True Grit"" star Hailee Steinfeld turns out to have an amazing soul voice as the newest Bella. Rebel Wilson and Adam DeVinePhoto Universal Studios The fondly snarky relationships and the dazzling a cappella arrangements of pop songs give the film the fizzy party atmosphere of its predecessor though one difference is the startling number of illegal-immigrant jokes delivered by a Latina Bella (Chrissie Fit). The sequel even comes up with a wonderful moment of found musicality that competes with Kendrick singing ""Cups"" three years ago This time she busts out a Christmas mash-up with Snoop Dogg. If guys avoid this movie because they think its icky girl stuff they should reconsider The main attraction isnt the sisterhood but the zigzag wit of writer Kay Cannon who has the same loopiness as the best Will Ferrell movies ""I will teach underprivileged children to sing or I will dance exotically"" says one Bella. And as Fat Amy Wilson -- a woman who could make lung cancer funny -- explains why an Australian like her can sing for the American team ""Im fat. And thats close enough.""

"Pitch Perfect 2 review Anna Kendrick and the Barden Bellas are funnier than ever |       OregonLive.com comments Pitch Perfect 2 review Anna Kendrick and the Barden Bellas are funnier than ever Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press Follow on Twitter on May 13 2015 at 1215 PM updated May 13 2015 at 1242 PM Comments ""Who run the world? GIRLS"" sing those irrepressible Barden University Bellas channeling Beyonce in ""Pitch Perfect 2."" And yes they sure do run the world. The highly anticipated sequel to the 2012 surprise hit ""Pitch Perfect"" is now more than ever a celebration of girl power girl bonding girl harmony and most of all girl laughs. As the Beyonce song goes on to say ""Boy dont even try to touch this."" That should be good news for the many many young women who loved the infectious ""Pitch Perfect."" And really all the news is good about this sequel It is if anything funnier than the original. It brings back all your favorite folks most notably the sweetly geeky and adorable Anna Kendrick and the bawdy nothing-is-sacred Rebel Wilson whose Fat Amy gets more screen time and makes the most of it. Theres also a new addition Hollywood it-girl Hailee Steinfeld as an aspiring songwriter. Aside from injecting new blood into the Bellas shes pretty much the only one who doesnt graduate college by the end of the movie -- significant for future sequels. The other important change of note is that ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is directed by actress Elizabeth Banks who also produces AND reprises her role as Gail half of one of the most hilarious broadcast teams ever conceived real or fictional. Her scenes with the cheerfully racist and sexist John (a sublime John Michael Higgins) narrating the Bellas various competitions are the films highlight. ""This is what happens when you send girls to college"" he says disapprovingly at one point. He describes the Bellas as an ""inspiration to girls all over the country too ugly to be cheerleaders."" We begin with our Bellas giving a command performance at Lincoln Center for President Barack Obamas birthday. All goes well until Fat Amys spandex pants rip. Shes suspended in the air and shes not wearing anything underneath. The theater erupts in shock. Newscasts go wild over the portly Aussies ""birthday gift from Down Under."" A jittery public is assured that the government has ""ruled out terrorism."" The disgraced Bellas are suspended from competition. But the ever-practical Beca (Kendrick) finds a loophole if they can win the WORLD championships will they be reinstated? Sure theyre told like THAT would ever happen. Their biggest competition Das Sound Machine. These European champions are terrifying in their perfection their production values and their general awesomeness -- and their disdain for the Bellas. ""I dont speak Loser what did you say?"" their lead singer (an imposing Birgitte Hjort Sorensen) says icily. Beca is horrified but helplessly smitten with the Heidi Klum lookalike. ""Your sweat smells like cinnamon "" she cries. The groups first compete at an epic ""riff-off"" which recalls one in the first movie only much more elaborate as happens in sequels. Among the groups competing the Green Bay Packers. Yes THOSE Green Bay Packers. (Turns out theyre huge fans of the franchise and not too shabby at a cappella.) The Bellas sure have their work cut out for them. Meanwhile busy Becas secretly moonlighting with an internship at a recording studio. (By the way do these people ever have like schoolwork?) Shes also still dating boyfriend Jesse (Skylar Astin) but the relationship feels like a total afterthought here. The script by Kay Cannon and Mickey Rapkin keeps the rapid-fire jokes coming. A throwaway reference to Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor is hysterical. Much less funny is a no-means-yes sex joke; we could have done without that one particularly in a college setting. It all comes down to a huge final confrontation before thousands of fans. Its panache and polish (Das Sound Machine) vs. spunk and spirit (the Bellas). And of course these girls have a few surprises up their sleeves. -- Jocelyn Noveck the Associated Press  ""Pitch Perfect 2"" Grade B+ Rated PG-13 Running time 115 minutes Playing at Opens Thursday May 14 at multiple locations Cast and crew Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson Brittany Snow Hailee Steinfeld Katey Sagal Skylar Astin Birgitte Hjort Sorensen John Michael Higgins Elizabeth Banks; directed by Banks.

"Review Pitch Perfect 2 still in tune - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Pitch Perfect 2 still in tuneBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 05/13/2015 123013 PM PDTUpdated 05/13/2015 051320 PM PDT I didnt expect the original ""Pitch Perfect"" to be good but it was. It wasnt great but sometimes unexpectedly good works just as well as great.But I certainly didnt expect the formula could be milked into an equally charming and fun sequel. Wrong again.""Pitch Perfect 2"" actually is more enjoyable than the original. First-time director Elizabeth Banks manages to move the story forward and wrap it up nicely without killing the concept. It blends a semisweet coming-of-age tale with the sincerity of a musical and some downright hilarity. Its flaws -- flatulence jokes rarely work in any non-Mel Brooks setting -- are swept away by an endearing story that simply and effectively refuses to take itself too seriously. (L-R) Anna Kendrick as Beca and Hailee Seinfeld as Emily in Pitch Perfect 2. (Richard Cartwright/Universal Studios) Set three years after the first movie we find the a cappella group Barden Bellas at the top of their game. As three-time U.S. champs theyre performing for President Barack Obama at the Lincoln Center in New York when everything goes bad. They become a laughingstock among the a cappella community (and among Supreme Court justices who apparently pay more attention to college a cappella than weve been led to believe). The Bellas desperate path to redemption runs through the world championships and a heavily favored genetically superior German team that falls somewhere between Kraftwerk and Rammstein when it comes to coldly powerful industrially precise performing. Advertisement Meanwhile lead Bella Beca (Anna Kendrick) is torn between starting her post-college career as a music producer and her responsibility to her singing sisterhood which includes perpetually freaked-out Chloe (Brittany Snow) absurdly funny Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) and cute-but-clumsy freshman Emily (Hailee Steinfeld a newcomer to the franchise). In trying to tailor their new approach to match the spectacular Germans the girls lose their way. Kendrick can be a bit dry at times (she still seems about 90 percent right for the role) and there are some enormous plot holes (how do college girls possess the time and money to craft shows that would leave Cher envious?). And ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is predictable. But the movie has a lot of heart and is emotionally engaging. Unlike its predecessor the conflict isnt centered around gender wars or internal power struggles its the Bellas versus the world -- literally. So while the focus on the individual characters isnt as sharp as in the first film there is more of a feel-good air around our heroes.And its surprisingly funny even with the sometimes repetitive jokes built around such things as Latin stereotypes and sexual preference.Then theres the music. Productions of old pop standbys performed by perky people often can be wince-inducing. But here they are effective. The climactic final song is actually sort of inspiring as is an impromptu campfire scene in which the Bellas get their groove back. Wilson putting a new spin on Pat Benatar was easily the comedy high point (a scene featuring David Cross and the Green Bay Packers is a close second). Banks also appears on the other side of the camera returning with John Michael Higgins to form a hilarious politically incorrect broadcast team that could have been plucked from a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit.Watching ""Pitch Perfect 2"" feels like a breezy visit with old friends -- youve worked through old issues and now can simply enjoy each other. True it relies more on gags than plot but for Banks and writer Kay Cannon the jokes work far more often than not. Now the only question is with the graduating seniors handing the reins to Steinfelds Emily will there be a third go-round with the Bellas? Should there be? I say no -- theyve bucked the odds twice and shouldnt tempt fate.Then again Ive been wrong before.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES A Game of Thrones spin-off?

Pitch Perfect 2 preview Meet Das Sound Machine No one really expected a low-budget musical comedy about college singing groups to become one of 2012s biggest box office success stories. But Hollywoods response to a hit like that is much easier to predict a sequel with more characters more chaos more meta pop culture riffs and more medleys (so many medleys) than you can aca-shake a stick at. Pitch Perfect 2 comes out swinging literally with a graphic onstage mishap involving Rebel Wilsons Fat Amy an aerial sling and a very scandalized POTUS. (Suffice it to say the press dubs it Muffgate.) Disgraced and barred from competing in nationals our harmonizing heroines the Barden Bellas find a loophole that allows them to enter the upcoming world competition in Copenhagen instead. But lo there be obstacles. Among them the Teutonic menace known as Das Sound Machine--a troupe of towering Germans who sing like angels and dress like sex-club Sprockets--and the divided attention of de facto Bellas leader Beca (Anna Kendrick) who is secretly interning for a high-strung music producer (Key amp; Peeles excellently mean Keegan-Michael Key). PP2 sometimes feels less like a movie than a two-hour episode of Glee ghostwritten by Amy Schumer; jokes fly like theyre being shot from T-shirt guns at a gonzo pep rally and not all of them stick the landing. But the story also gives big joyful voice to groups whose members have spent their whole lives being targeted because of who they are be it black gay overweight female or just deeply uncool. Now--to quote Beyonce a patron saint of Pitchery--they run this mother.

This tuneful entertaining sequel almost makes you forget that its pretty much the same joke told twice In the world of sequels there are those rare exceptions where the second movie improves on the first and there are those all too common continuations that waste your time and threaten to make you forget why you ever liked their predecessors. Somewhere in the middle you get second chapters that pretty much tell you the same jokes again but with enough new spins and angles and reversals that you wind up entertained and amused even though you miss that sense of discovery and novelty. For better or for worse thats the spot where ""Pitch Perfect 2"" lands. See Video Pitch Perfect 2 Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson Battle for Groups Very Existence in New Trailer (Video) Did you like it in the original ""Pitch Perfect"" when collegiate a cappella girl group the Barden Bellas embarrassed themselves onstage and then had to repair their damaged reputation through friendship and bold song choices? Or when commentators John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks also directing this time) said outrageous and inappropriate things? Or the outsized confidence of Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) or the weird whispered non sequiturs of Lily (Hana Mae Lee) or the Type-A freakouts of Chloe (Brittany Snow) or the interchangability and lack of screen time of Jessica (Kelley Jakle) and Ashley (Shelley Regner)? Lucky you. ""Pitch Perfect 2"" serves it all up again with just enough flashes of absurdist wit musical brio and new characters to keep this serviceably fun follow-up from going down like a plate of lukewarm leftovers. We open with the Bellas enjoying their reputation as three-time national champs until an unfortunate mishap at Kennedy Center involving live television the President of the United States and a Fat Amy wardrobe malfunction. Stripped of their title and forced to hand their national tour over to their German nemeses Das Sound Machine the only chance that the Bellas have to stay in the game is to travel to Copenhagen and win the world championship. See Video Anna Kendrick Dares to Take on Jimmy Fallon in Egg Russian Roulette (Video) Plot-wise thats pretty much it except for Beca (Anna Kendrick) tuning out of the Bellas problems by interning at a record label whose owner played by Keegan-Michael Key takes time out from producing a Snoop Dogg Christmas album to tell Becca to knock it off with the mash-ups already and start creating something original. Lucky for Becca new Bella legacy Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) writes her own music despite the fact that anything that isnt a cover is anathema to the a cappella world. Even though that numeral in the title threatens to weigh down ""Pitch Perfect 2"" director Banks and returning screenwriter Kay Cannon find something unexpected and funny for each scene whether its an overwrought duet for Fat Amy and her love interest Bumper (Adam Devine) an unexpected cameo by professional athletes or the rigorous precision of Das Sound Machine whose stern leaders Komissar (Birgitte Hjort Sorenson) and Pieter (Flula Borg) leave Beca so sexually flummoxed that she cant even trash-talk them. See Video Anna Kendrick Jams to J. Los Booty in New Lip Sync Battle Trailer (Video) The one element of ""Pitch Perfect"" that this new film cant provide is surprise; if youre willing to forfeit discovery in favor of some breezy deja vu however ""Pitch Perfect 2"" is totally playing your song.

"Pitch Perfect 2 review Snide and lazy just dont cut it - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Pitch Perfect 2 review Snide and lazy just dont cut it Pitch Perfect 2 Richard Cartwright/Universal Pictures The Barden Bellas sing during a scene from the film ""Pitch Perfect 2."" The Barden Bellas sing during a scene from the film ""Pitch Perfect 2."" (Richard Cartwright/Universal Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune It gets by but this sequel to the 2012 hit ""Pitch Perfect"" isnt much to sing home about. Can we please talk about the snottiness of ""Pitch Perfect 2""? Its seriously snotty. Its a two-hour lesson in how to act like a frenemy to your alleged friends. And its not funny enough.Correction For the sequel to become a global success yes its funny enough. And some of the vocals are choice. But I am not representing the a cross-section of the planets ""Pitch Perfect"" fan base with this review Im representing myself and I found the new movie snide and lazy instead of wittily sarcastic. Slight difference there and even talented screenwriters and promising first-time directors can miss it. In the 2012 hit which was equal parts PG-13 raunch and energetically paced underdog fantasy screenwriter Kay Cannon (who wrote the sequel as well) let Anna Kendricks wary guarded Beca run the show and negotiate the narrative complications with a light dry touch. This time by design Kendrick fades into the ensemble woodwork and her characters main dilemma is how long she can keep her recording studio internship a secret from the all-female Barden Bellas a capella group. Its a dumb conflict -- delayed secrets tend not to work when stretched across half a movie or more even if you have Keegan-Michael Key aboard to play the music producer who becomes Becas mentor.The Bellas are laid low early on in ""Pitch Perfect 2"" when Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson and honestly that character name is such a drag) accidentally exposes her genitalia during a concert attended by Barack and Michelle Obama. In the first film the inciting humilation was due to ill-timed projectile vomiting. There will most assuredly be a ""Pitch Perfect 3"" so you wonder where theyre going to go next in terms of a contrived big opening. Banned from their national tour but not from the world a capella competition in Copenhagen the Bellas must learn to regroup relocate their sound and settle their romantic hash. Fat Amys hook-ups with Bumper (Adam Devine) lead to an awkward ""what is this really?"" interlude. Meantime Becas relationship with Jesse (Skylar Astin) is perfunctory at best. Screenwriter Cannon is more interested in putting Beca in verbal smackdowns with the Bellas hostile German rivals members of a group called Das Sound Machine. I havent seen such poor Teutonic stereotyping since the evil skier in ""Hot Dog...the Movie."" Rebel Wilson Richard Cartwright Universal Pictures Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy steals the show in ""Pitch Perfect 2"". Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy steals the show in ""Pitch Perfect 2"". (Richard Cartwright Universal Pictures) In her first feature as director Elizabeth Banks does well enough with spotty material and back in front of the camera as well alongside John Michael Higgins as the snide color commentators tracking the competition action. Hearing Kendrick and company harmonize once again on ""When Im Gone"" (used in the first rather better movie) is easy on the ears and Hailee Steinfeld as the idealistic newbie is a breath of fresh air. For big fans of the first ""Pitch Perfect"" the sequel will not aggravate or offend. But I swear in one party sequence Kendrick appears to be stifling a yawn. Its Wilsons movie anyway for better or worse.""Pitch Perfect 2"" - 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for innuendo and language) Aca-awesome Pitch Perfect 2 premiere draws hordes of fans Saba Hamedy ""We are only here because of the fans"" Elizabeth Banks director of ""Pitch Perfect 2"" said before the films premiere at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles on Friday.

Sometimes that happens While The Godfather is great The Godfather Part II expands on its dramatic intensity without repeating any of the same tricks and The Empire Strikes Back is a much more operatic and emotionally complex picture than Star Wars. Jason Moores Pitch Perfect which riffed on the highs and lows of an all-woman college a cappella group became a surprise hit upon its release in 2012. It was a cheerful straightforward picture about Being Who You Are Finding New Love and Singing Out Loud. And really who doesnt love singing? Especially a cappella singing in which human voices in their gloriously naked state blend into swirls of color that hardly need instrumental accompaniment (even if in this case those voices have been aggressively Auto-Tuned). A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Ideally Pitch Perfect 2 -- which also happens to be the feature directorial debut of Elizabeth Banks -- would simply offer more of those simple guileless good things. And it sort of does -- but thats just the problem. Pitch Perfect 2 tries to fork over many of the pleasures of the first movie without changing them around all that much. Theres a do-or-die competition (this time the team to beat is a bunch of humorless Germans who call themselves Das Sound Machine) several romances that stumble before getting off the ground and the usual ceremonial humiliation of the overweight girl. Rebel Wilson once again plays Fat Amy who embraces her size with gusto and you might say she makes her entrance in Pitch Perfect 2 ass-backward. Amy accepts her fate cheerfully even though the embarrassment she suffers is really just sort of blandly unfunny Her way-too-tight costume rips during an important performance and the fact that she isnt wearing any underwear gets the group banned from further competition.Pitch Perfect 2 isnt awful; but despite all its striving to give us more it just doesnt have the energy that a sequel needs to leap the bar of high expectations. Anna Kendrick possibly the worlds most adorable human chipmunk returns as Beca who is now rounding the end of her senior year at (fictional) Barden College. The sorority-slash-singing group to which she belongs the Bellas have inducted a new member Emily (the charmingly low-key Hailee Steinfeld) who seems to fit in right away -- her voice is light lilting and sweet. In fact her only flaw is that she happens to have a gift for writing her own material while the Bellas favor cover songs. So whats the problem exactly? Meanwhile Beca has become somewhat distracted by the internship she has kept secret from the other Bellas Shes working at a recording studio run by an exacting tyrant played wonderfully by Keegan-Michael Key -- every scene hes in has a crackerjack nuttiness.Film Details Pitch Perfect 2 RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time115 min. More Info Trailer The story is stuffed with subplots and gags that are sometimes fun by themselves but dont quite cohere into a whole -- the picture has a melismatic waywardness as if its singing as fast as it can yet is never quite sure where its going. (The script once again is by Kay Cannon based on characters by Mickey Rapkin.) Theres a major sing-off hosted by a rich eccentric a cappella fan (David Cross in a silky bathrobe) which is the movies most exhilarating sequence -- Banks keeps it cooking suggesting that with better material she could take the loopy spirit she brings to her film performances and translate it into behind-the-camera vision. She also appears in the film reprising her role as prissy competition commentator Gail; mostly she provides deadpan reactions to colleague John Michael Higginss off-the-map intentionally sexist wisecracks which are so exaggerated that theyre wholly inoffensive. Even so they may have been funnier on paper.Every once in a while though a joke lands on the tonic Wilsons Fat Amy calls the Bellas smirking German competition ""Deutschbags""; Hana Mae Lee is back in her small but mighty role as Bella member Lilly Okanakamura making outlandish Dada pronouncements (""All of my teeth are from other people"") in her tiny breathy voice; Wilson has a great sight gag in which her heartfelt en plein air rendering of an over-the-top love ballad -- sung to her honeybunch Bumper played by Adam DeVine -- is interrupted by an SUV that pauses at a road crossing like a puzzled cow unsure if its safe to proceed. Theres enough to laugh at in Pitch Perfect 2 and the singing is fun but the movie doesnt match or exceed the polyphonic jubilance of its predecessor. Its stuck on middle C.Directed by Elizabeth Banks. Written by Kay Cannon.

This sequel opens as all-girl group the Bellas are branded a national disgrace after a vagina-flashing incident involving Barack Obama. The girls are singing to the President in front of a crowd of thousands when Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson genius) has a wardrobe malfunction revealing her lady parts live on television. The TV news coverage is hilarious (the FBI has ruled out terrorism). President Nixon had Watergate. This is Muffgate. Nothing in the rest of the film comes remotely close to being as funny. Minutes pass without a big laugh and theres definitely one song too many. But Pitch Perfect 2 has its Spinal Tap moments. The only way the Bellas can redeem their reputation is to win at the a cappella world championships in Holland - an event thats like Glastonbury for nerds. Standing in their way is the techno-fierce black-leather clad German group Das Sound Machine (or Deutsche Bags as the Bellas call them). Pitch Perfect 2 is totally goofy but very sweet. And theres a decent side-plot as Becca (the alt-girl with too much eyeliner played by the awesome Anna Kendrick) heads off to intern with a hotshot producer working on a Christmas album with Snoop Dogg. As with the first film youll be dying to switch on your phone to save the instantly quotable gems (What did you say? I dont speak loser). And once again Rebel Wilson - a woman who could make a George Osborne speech funny - is the coolest woman in the room.

I just.... I still love you but really your first major foray into direction just didnt work for me. Some of the jokes were spot on guest appearances from the likes of David Cross and Flula slayed me the final performance at the international competition had me in tears but the rest of the film was as flat as TV I watched it on. The sparkle and ingenuity of the first one wasnt there the subtle jokes didnt play out leaving you unfulfilled and if I hadnt paid to rent it on Amazon Prime I probably would have turned it off. Its a shame because it had such potential but I fear the editing room had a lot to do with the final result as the flow didnt feel as smooth as I would have expected and there were too many story lines to make a solid narrative.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 11 2015Ros ATastemakerFeaturedThis film killed me a bit because I loved the first one so much.

Reprising the kind of musical performances campus high jinks stinging humor and sassy sisterhood on display in its eminently likeable predecessor Pitch Perfect 2 remixes the elements and comes up with something even slicker and sharper. As the films Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) might say theyve crushed it. However its not like we dont have notes. With more characters in play in addition to the regulars returning screenwriter Kay Cannon (a 30 Rock alumnus) and castmember-producer Elizabeth Banks (also making her directorial debut on the feature) have to scramble hard to keep all the component parts in harmony. That means some endearing elements from the first movie like the romance between Beca (Anna Kendrick) and her tenor boyfriend Jesse (Skylar Astin) barely get a look-in and the number of cameos from famous faces is beginning to approach Anchorman-like levels of overkill. But none of that will stop this from being a smash likely to outstrip the 112 million-plus worldwide takings of its sleeper antecedent in every territory. Read more Pitch Perfect 2 New Trailer Watch the Barden Bellas Run the World The opening sequence finds history repeating itself with an onstage embarrassment. Pitch Perfect started by putting all-girl campus a cappella group the Barden Bellas on the back foot when their leader Aubrey (Anna Camp) blows chunks all over the audience at the climax of their national championship performance. Here four years on from the events of the first film the humiliation is even greater when Fat Amys spandex outfit splits in the middle of a performance in front of President Obama and the first lady to reveal shes gone commando producing a widely reported-on scandal (""Muffgate""). That mishap gets the Bellas officially reprimanded by the overlords of competitive a cappellas governing body podcasting co-presidents Gail (Banks) and John (John Michael Higgins). (The latters smoothly delivered misogyny -- ""Lets hear it for the girls too ugly to be cheerleaders"" -- and casual racism throughout is even funnier this go-round.) Although the terms of the disciplinary action prohibit the Bellas from holding auditions theres nothing in the ruling that says they cant take on ""legacy"" members like eager freshman Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) whose mom (Katey Sagal) was a legendary five-octave-ranged member of the group back in the 1980s. Another new face is that of Flo (Chrissie Fit) a Central American transfer student who keeps dropping references to her horrifically impoverished childhood into the conversation. With Aubrey graduated and gone chipper Chloe (Brittany Snow) is now the groups spokesperson and chief choreographer with Beca in charge of arrangements. But due to a new job interning at a record label run by a domineering boss (Keegan-Michael Key vivid in just a few scenes) Becas attention is divided and like the others her confidence is eroded when she sees what theyre up against when they arrive at the world competition in Copenhagen. See more How Hollywood Harmonizes A Cappella Appearances in Movies and TV Taking on the antagonist function now that some of the girls are openly dating members of Barden Colleges other star a cappella outfit The Treblemakers is Teutonic supergroup Das Sound Machine an arrogant bunch of ""Deutschbags"" as Fat Amy terms them led by the Kommissar (Dane Birgitte Hjort Sorensen from Borgen) a Valkyrie-like chanteuse and her simpering if strapping second-in-command Pieter (YouTube-star Flula Borg). As the Bellas are bested and intimidated by them in a series of official and off-the-books throw-downs the girls start to forget who they are and what makes them special resulting in misguided stage experiments in light-up hula hoops and pyrotechnics that literally threaten to burn them up. (The unfortunate member whose hair is set alight is butch-Bella Cynthia-Rose played once again by the magnificent singer-songwriter Ester Dean. Her limitations as an actor are discernible but its still a shame the film doesnt give her more solos to show off that belter of a voice apart from letting her sing the closing-credits tune.) As the above will suggest theres a helluva lot going on here plot- and character-wise and what with extra flesh being put on the bones of characters played by rising stars like Wilson and a romantic subplot involving Steinfelds Emily and magic-and-music geek Benji (Ben Platt) key supports like whispering Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) boy-crazy Stacie (Alexis Knapp) and -- my favorite -- the two girls who are always in the background but barely ever get a line or close-up (Kelley Jakle and Shelley Regner) are left with variations on the same gags they had in the original. Nevertheless the film aptly feels more like an ensemble piece than its progenitor which anchored itself more tightly to Kendricks outsider lead. Here she seems much more like one of the gang an impression cemented by the films dominant choice of medium-distance group shots that showcase the actors impressive comic timing. Musically the songbook is a far hipper more youth-skewed selection featuring a lot more new-millennium material especially in the delightful sing-off scene which showcases a medley of ditties about butts (and even -- shock horror -- the odd original composition heresy in the cover-centric world of a cappella). Executive music producers Julianne Jordan and Julia Michels have ensured that every performance is note-perfect and soundtrack-album ready which rather detracts from any sense of realism its simply not possible for groups to sing this in-sync spontaneously on the first try of every tune and perhaps more of a look at the rehearsal work involved could have enhanced the story. Plus unless my ears deceive me there are a couple of tracks that sound distinctly slicked up by drum machines or perhaps some other non-human instrumentation and thats not very ""a ca-thentic"" is it? Read more The Battle Is On in New Pitch Perfect 2 Trailer Not that the franchises core fan base is likely to mind much given what a rollicking ride the whole thing is. With nimble assists from all below-the-line departments Banks Cannon and the cast have crafted a sequel thats edgier sexier and best of all more female-centric than its predecessor. The film should also help put an end to that stupid old debate about whether women can be as funny as men. With a good wind behind them like they have here theyre funnier -- get over it bitches.

"Pitch Perfect 2 Review Girls Run the World in Riotous Comedy Sequel | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Pitch Perfect 2 Guy Lodge Film Critic guylodge 7 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr May 7 2015 | 0800AM PT Elizabeth Banks makes a credible directing debut with a riotous even more female-driven sequel to the 2012 hit. When Beyonces brisk female-empowerment jam ""Run the World (Girls)"" kicks off a key musical number in ""Pitch Perfect 2"" it plays as something of a mission statement for the film itself Both behind and in front of the camera women call every shot of consequence in this ebulliently entertaining arguably superior sequel to the 2012 musical comedy hit. Continuing the bawdy misadventures of all-girl college a cappella group the Barden Bellas -- this time as they get their motley act together on a global stage -- Kay Cannons script is even lighter on narrative than its predecessor but fills any resulting void with a concentrated supply of riotous gags and a renewed emphasis on the virtues of female collaboration and independence. Actress-producer Elizabeth Banks eminently credible feature directing debut should in its own parlance crush it at the global box office sustaining a franchise with potential to outlive the ""Glee"" fever that inspired it. In a typically testosterone-heavy summer movie landscape ""Pitch Perfect 2"" stands out not just for its expanded female ensemble but for passing the Bechdel test on a scene-to-scene basis. While the first film hinged heavily on battle-of-the-sexes friction the returning male characters here have largely been relegated to afterthought status Save for a pair of sweet swiftly resolved romantic subplots men are often the furthest thing from the sequels mind as post-graduation questions of career and self-sufficiency weigh heavily on the Bellas. A degree of democratization meanwhile has taken place within their ranks. If Anna Kendricks aspiring music producer Beca is still the ostensible protagonist of the piece its only by a hair Rebel Wilson the brash breakout star of ""Pitch Perfect"" three years ago benefits from a beefed-up role this time that amply accommodates her improvisatory abilities while new recruit Hailee Steinfeld is afforded the most sympathetic arc as the youngest inheritor of the groups self-described legacy. The creative twinning of Steinfelds character with Kendricks -- she is the songwriter to the latters musical director -- makes it clear from the outset that the ""True Grit"" star is being groomed as the anchoring lead for future sequels. With any luck those installments will ask more of the franchises commendable spread of minority Bellas who are still underused here Soft-spoken Korean eccentric Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) and new Latin American exchange student Flo (Chrissie Fit) are one-joke props albeit funny ones while Ester Deans African-American belter Cynthia Rose identifies as a lesbian only in the most cautious terms. Happily ""caution"" is rarely the operative word of a film that begins with a spectacular vagina-related pratfall and maintains that level of cheerful impertinence throughout. Three years have passed since the Bellas became national a cappella champions and theyve held that title ever since; now all in their senior year (including Brittany Snows dim-bulb former leader Chloe so wedded to the group that shes stubbornly staying a seventh year in college) they are eager to go out with a bang. Not quite the bang however that follows a botched Lincoln Center performance for President Obama -- featured in cheekily unconvincing cutaways -- that culminates in an accidental onstage crotch reveal by the self-styled Fat Amy (Wilson). The ensuing media furor hilariously branded ""Muffgate"" sees the girls vilified from all sides A celebrity cameo-studded news montage sharply handled by Banks neatly sends up the pervasive social media-fueled ""outrage culture"" of the moment. To add injury to insult the Bellas are stripped of their showcase performing duties by the conservative gatekeepers of Americas college a cappella league once more deliciously played by Banks herself and Christopher Guest alum John Michael Higgins whose blithely bigoted asides count for many of the pics heartiest laughs. (""This is what happens when you send girls to college"" he remarks with a toothpaste grin.) Taking the girls place are European favorites Das Sound Machine a militarized co-ed troupe of Teutonic giants in formidable fetish gear whose repertoire of stiffly accented 90s hip-hop staples (""Zis Is How Ve Do It"" ""Insane In Ze Membrane"") doesnt get any less amusing with frequent repetition. Beating these ""Deutschbags"" at the looming World Championships in Copenhagen -- an unprecedented feat for a U.S. team -- reps the Bellas only shot at redemption. First however theres some internal tension to be resolved mostly revolving around Becas covert internship at a recording studio manned by a fearsome Grammy-laden producer played with inspired comic sadism by the excellent Keegan-Michael Key. (Becas steady relationship with Skylar Astins Jesse her puppyish love interest from the first film merits markedly little screen time here; career comes first for this heroine.) With the Bellas seeking to regain both their collective mojo and Becas drifting commitment cue a series of haphazardly connected training montages and sing-offs -- one of them an affair of ""Zoolander""-level absurdity mediated by of all people David Cross (here billed under his Sir Willups Brightslymoore persona). Meanwhile gawky college junior Emily (Steinfeld) a second-generation Bella encouraged by her overeager mom (Katey Sagal) shyly attempts to steer the group from karaoke covers to original material. Thus does the film take the worthy stance that endurance lies in innovation though Cannons somewhat indifferently structured script isnt always its own best example Theres a fair amount of rehashed material here not just from ""Pitch Perfect"" but from every lets-put-on-a-show musical from the era of Busby Berkeley to ""Step Up."" Such reservations seems strictly academic however when viewed against the wholes sheer volume of hilarity. Cannons wicked one-liners (""This could be the most significant conflict between America and Germany in history"") are in even greater abundance this time while Banks taking over from previous helmer Jason Moore handles goofy physical setpieces with fizzy aplomb A waterborne duet of Pat Benatars ""We Belong"" between Fat Amy and would-be b.f. Bumper (Adam Devine aces) is a particular gem. No prizes for guessing that the irrepressible Wilson once more poaches most of her scenes with her dryly lascivious line readings and impromptu Down Underisms but there isnt one idle member in the films uniformly sparky ensemble. Tech credits are uniformly pro A few split-screen sequences represent the extent of Banks visual risk-taking but Denaults crayon-bright lensing and Salvador Perezs witty frisky costumes lift things out of televisual territory. Musically perhaps ""Pitch Perfect 2"" isnt quite as infectious as its predecessor. Theres a canned-sounding quality to certain early performances (which as with ""Glee"" are about as authentically a cappella as Milli Vanilli) while few of the song selections and mashups match the ingenuity of Kendricks ""When Im Gone"" a viral phenomenon from the first film that is cannily reprised here. Still like the Bellas the film digs deep when it matters and a climactic performance of Emilys original ballad ""Flashlight"" (custom-written by Sia and Sam Smith no less) is rousing in spite of its own saccharine obviousness. As with so much thats right about the ""Pitch Perfect"" formula its the singers not the song. Film Review Pitch Perfect 2Reviewed at May Fair Hotel screening room London May 6 2015.

JD says January 11 2016 at 343 am I feel like this movie was just a cynical vehicle for Hailee Steinfelds music career which is also under Universal albeit their record label division. I spent the whole movie feeling like this poorly fleshed out overtly and desperately trying to be adorably awkward was being forced on me at the expense of plot narrative and character development of other Bellas or the development of the Bellas as a unit. Hailee overacted in a cringy way proving that overacting is a comedic gift that only Parker Posy can present with endearing realism. It was a funny movie though when not focused on Steinfeld and had potential there for great moments between the Bellas. The musical numbers were brilliant and Das Sound Machine were a wonderful addition. Thankfully little focus was put on Jesses character who I found to be drippy and annoying in the first installment. The two leaders of Das Sound Machine were comedy gold and their exchanges with the Bellas were highlights. The addition of Flo and her one note jokes were also something I greatly appreciated as with the subtlety of the back and forth between her and the dim witted Chloe who acts as a great straight man to some hard hitting truth bombs. I was happy to see that Esther Dean has been given more leads in the musical numbers and hope that if another sequel does happen that they stay true to the greatness of the first and shows us more of the characters we love. To be completely frank Im really not looking forward to Pitch Perfect 3 because of Hailee Steinfleds character which signposts the third film as a watered down teenybopper ""oh look how adorkable I am"" internet pandering session. While Ive watched PP2 a worrying amount of times since it came out I miss the charm of the first movie. I would rather say goodbye to the Bellas now than watch a third with all new Bellas and Emily at the helm. All I can hope is that they listen to the fans the reviews and the general consensus and produce/write/direct accordingly.
