Comments The Incredibles Rated PG  115 minutes This Pixar comic-book adventure (2004) is fun for the first half hour as the worlds superheroes are forced into retirement by personal-injury lawsuits and assigned new identities by the government. In a sort of big-screen New Yorker cartoon the barrel-chested Mr. Incredible lives a life of quiet desperation dividing his time between an insurance company cubicle and a vanilla tract home he shares with the former Elastigirl and their three moppets. The fun hardens into Fun after hes lured out of retirement and imprisoned in a remote island compound though the sleek computer animation is spellbinding as usual. Brad Bird (The Iron Giant) wrote and directed; with the voices of Craig T. Nelson Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson. By J.R.

Then a secret-mission invite snags Mr Is curiosity...Plot logic isnt the films strongest suit and its rapid gag rate and quick-heeled turns of tale dont wholly paper over some questions begged not to mention some ideological loose ends. The film brilliantly acknowledges the experience of parental compromise and glory-days nostalgia commingles that with the everyman fantasy of repressed eminence and then seems to egg on the latters anti-egalitarian ethic how else to interpret the dictum that saying everyone is special is another way of saying no one is a jibe the film makes twice? And its pastiche of caped-crusader tropes neatly (and unironically) synchs with the enduring American daydream of global salvation. But what pastiche what playfulness Seamlessly blending comic-book caper domestic comedy and sci-fi spy fantasy the film is a triumph of design wit and zip from its villains retro-futurist island hideaway to the montage of superhero couture faux-pas presented by the Incredibles dotty confidante Madame Edna (Birds own spoof of the late Hollywood costumier Edith Head). Bombastic finale aside its a cut (and an age-range) above the simplicities of Finding Nemo. Bud Luckeys accompanying short rhyming rondelay Boundin is double reason to get to the cinema on time.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Incredibles The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; incredibles-the ) Incredibles The (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Incredibles may become the first Disney/Pixar film not to dominate at the box office. That statement has nothing to do with the films quality - in fact The Incredibles is among the best of Pixars digitally animated movies. However its going up against The Polar Express which has a number of advantages not the least of which are its built-in audience and seasonal appeal. More than anything else The Incredibles is likely to be a victim of bad timing. Dont shed any tears for its makers however. The film will still keep the cash registers ringing until it attains ""blockbuster"" status although it wont be the runaway hit that Pixars last production Finding Nemo was. As the crop of digitally animated films becomes more abundant audiences are likely to demand increasingly more from such movies. The early efforts mostly had everything beautiful visuals great voice acting and superior writing. But as more of these pictures reach screens and they become ""routine"" its natural to speculate whether there will be a slip in quality. Fortunately such a trend (if it ever develops) is not in evidence in The Incredibles. As with Toy Story and Finding Nemo Pixar has again struck gold. The Incredibles isnt just fine family entertainment its superior family entertainment. One thing immediately noticeable about this picture is that it is markedly more mature in tone and approach than any previous digitally animated movie (excepting Final Fantasy which was intended for - and did not reach - an entirely different audience). Thats not to say that kids even young ones wont enjoy The Incredibles but it appears that writer/director Brad Bird composed his film with older children and their parents in mind. Also because of the long running time (nearly two hours) boys and girls prone to restlessness may have trouble sitting through everything. The Incredibles confronts the midlife crisis of a once-popular superhero. In his prime Mr. Incredible (voice of Craig T. Nelson) was beloved by millions. Saving the world wasnt just his job; it was his passion. (""No matter how many times you save the world it always gets in jeopardy again."") But things changed. People began filing lawsuits against the superheroes (starting with a suicide victim irate that his life was saved) driving them underground courtesy of the ""Superhero Relocation Program"" which offered a new life in return for a promise never to act as a superhero again. At first Mr. Incredible and his beloved wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) were happy to live as Bob and Helen Parr and raise their children speedy Dash (Spencer Fox); shy shrinking Violet (Sarah Vowell); and baby Jack-Jack. But as his job at an insurance company becomes increasingly abrasive Mr. Incredible yearns for the old days. Some nights he and his old buddy Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) listen to the police scanner then give the cops a little unexpected aid. But its not enough. Then along comes a mysterious woman (Elizabeth PeA+-a) with a job offer and Mr. Incredible sees a chance to regain his self-confidence and convince himself that he can once again make a difference. With its amazing variety of locations (the streets of a city under the sea a tropical island etc.) The Incredibles may be the most visually daunting animated film to reach the screen to-date. And its close to flawless. Only the people are rendered more like cartoons than reality and thats a conscious decision. (If you want to see almost-real humans The Polar Express is the closest youre likely to get at this time.) Digital animation has become so commonplace that we take its detail for granted but a little consideration of the needed effort will result in a reaction not far removed from awe. Although The Incredibles has plenty of action (including chases and battle scenes) its strength is that it makes the characters and their relationships more important than the fights and pyrotechnics. This is a close family - they just happen to possess some rather unusual abilities. Think Spy Kids only animated. Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are still in love even after 15 years of marriage (although she has adjusted better than him to domestic life). The children have believable love/hate relationships with their parents. Dash is willful and disobedient because hes bored - he wants to use his super-speed to excel in sports. And Violet has entered that gawky stage of life when her body becomes uncomfortable to inhabit. She uses her invisibility to spy on a boy she likes without being seen. The films director is Brad Bird who fashioned the uncommon The Iron Giant a traditionally animated effort that has developed a large following amongst adults. For his latest outing Bird keeps the same audience in mind. Where some animated movies attract adults using pop references and sly one-liners Bird keeps older viewers interested by not dumbing down his screenplay. Its inevitable that some of The Incredibles themes (such as that of a middle-age crisis) will go over the heads of kids but it wont hurt the experience for them. Theyll still thrill to the action scenes and laugh at the jokes. And theyll get the overall message about parents being the most important superheroes. But Birds approach makes this a richer and more worthwhile experience for the over-18 crowd. No need to don a trenchcoat and sneak into this movie. No review of The Incredibles would be complete without mentioning the men and women who lend their voices to their cartoon alter-egos. Craig T. Nelson (known best for his TV work in ""Coach"" and ""The District"") is wonderful blending the occasional pomposity of Tim Allens Buzz Lightyear with more human qualities. Holly Hunters voice is perhaps a little too recognizable but it doesnt take long for us to forget the actress as the character comes to life. A similar comment can be made about Samuel L. Jackson. And Jason Lee abandons his fatuous live-action reputation to play the villain Syndrome a character who is equal parts pathetic and dangerous. Ever wonder whether retired superheroes are subject to widening midsections and bad backs? Do they have problems with male pattern baldness? Wonder no longer. Those are just a few of the lighter questions that The Incredibles answers. Birds feature is appropriately titled - it describes how most viewers will react to this exemplary mixture of top-notch storytelling visual razzle-dazzle accessible humor and involving action. The Incredibles is without question one of 2004s most accomplished and enjoyable family-oriented films. Incredibles The (United States 2004) Director Brad Bird Cast (voices) Craig T.

It was hard enough when Mr. Incredible his soon-to-be-wife Elastigirl and good buddy Frozone were expected to swoop in and foil bank robbers prevent suicide plunges from tall buildings and pluck stray cats out of trees. But shortly after the movie opens -- and after Mr. Incredible performs a series of rescues while en route to the altar -- the over-litigious regular folks who populate his universe decide theyre fed up with all the residual damage (broken windows privacy issues etc.) that ensue when superheroes do their heroic work. And so in a flurry of lawsuits that would bankrupt the government Mr. Incredible and his cohorts find themselves banished to the superhero relocation program forced to live out regular-Joe existences. _____More in Movies_____  The Incredibles Details  Watch the Trailer  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Being average it turns out is a lot harder than saving the world. Produced by the folks responsible for last years blockbuster success ""Finding Nemo"" (as well as the ""Toy Story"" movies and ""Monsters Inc."") ""The Incredibles"" is a departure for Pixar (which also departs from its Disney partnership next year). The film has a P in front of its usual G and instead of being driven by its warm squishy heart the plot is action-propelled. This is not your fuzzy cuddly ""Monsters Inc."" story line; this is your old-school Saturday morning TV superhero cartoons on technologic steroids. As always Pixar excels with its animation but what makes this family film even more appealing is the smartness of the script which is clearly written end to end to appeal to adults as well as children. Instead of simply using double-entendres and sight gags ""The Incredibles"" is a superb send-up of stereotypical suburbia complete with bland tract house endless commute in bumper-to-bumper traffic smiling stay-at-home mom and for dad a cubicle job in the decidedly white-collar insurance world. They even have leftovers night. Fast-forward 15 years from Mr. Incredibles heyday and we find him living as Bob Parr (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) married to Helen Parr (formerly Elastigirl who is made all the more rich by Holly Hunters earthy voice). The Parrs have three children the teenage Violet the hyper elementary-aged Dash and baby Jack Jack. A midlife crisis looms ""Mr. Incredible"" just cant handle not being well incredible. And so when he ostensibly goes out for ""bowling night"" once a week with his old pal Frozone (hilariously voiced by Samuel L. Jackson -- sadly underutilized in the film) we find the two instead listening to a police scanner looking for opportunities to flex their now-flabby superhero muscles. Enter Mirage a mysterious woman who offers Bob Parr a mysterious opportunity to resume his former identity. Unable to resist Mr. Incredible squeezes his now middle-aged love-handled body into his old superhero suit and jets off to a volcanic island where he meets up with the man he later discovers to be his nemesis. What ensues is a series of clashes as the entire Incredible family gets sucked into trying to save the world from a villain whos plotting to kill off all the superheroes. The movie is full of wonderful little touches Syndrome the bad guy is drawn to remind viewers of ""Heat Miser"" from the classic Christmas cartoon ""The Year Without a Santa Claus."" Director Brad Bird practically steals his own picture with his voicing of Edna the costume designer with the black bob the oversize black glasses and the deadpan laugh-out-loud lines we cant do justice to here. But at its heart the film is about family. Violet (voiced by Sarah Vowell) is instantly familiar as the teenage girl who pines for the cute boy fights with her little brother and is so uncertain of herself and her changing body that she literally hides behind her own hair. Dash is the classic rambunctious little boy driven nuts by the fact that his superhuman speed prevents him from being able to join any sports teams (hed just be too good). Their interactions with Helen as they race to help their father fend off Syndrome include some classic parental moments. ""I know what I said"" Helen tells Violet while frustratingly trying to convince her daughter that its now okay to use her long-denied superpowers. ""Listen to what Im saying now"" While ""Incredibles"" doesnt have the visual lusciousness that marked ""Nemo"" -- or the high-stakes heart-rending pull that comes with the traditional ""Bambis mommy is dead"" kid-film moment -- Pixar geeks will love the trademark high-tech animation including Elastigirls ability to slither into all means of Twister-like positions and a wonderful sequence when Dash finally lets loose his superhuman speed on the island. In the end its Helen who captures the essence of the movie when she gently tells her daughter ""You have more power than you realize."" Her point is simple It really is okay to not be average after all. The Incredibles (115 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for a lot more action-related violence than is usually seen in animated childrens movies.

The Incredibles"" lives up to its title. This grand adventure yarn about a retired family of superheroes getting its groove back is in several ways the most ambitious and genre-expanding entry in Pixars extraordinary run of innovative and monstrously successful computer animated pictures. Writer-director Brad Birds highly anticipated follow-up to his much-lauded 1999 ""Iron Giant"" delivers the sort of excitement imagination wit and panache that will make it enormously appealing to a wide spectrum of audiences around the world. A muscular marketing push will launch this penultimate Disney release of a Pixar feature into high and sustained B.O. orbit with merchandising and ancillary sure to keep the profits rolling in for a long time to come. As deliriously smart escapist fare ""The Incredibles"" is practically nonpareil. But strictly on the commercial side there are some factors that could hold the film back a bit from the record-breaking numbers of its Pixar predecessors. Conceived as a deep-dish entertainment for adults as well as for kids pic runs nearly two hours and is the first company title rated PG. These factors along with the exclusively ""human"" cast of characters (no animals toys or creatures) abundant plot elements and dominance of sophisticated humor over laugh-out-loud gags might cede the youngest end of the age demographic and perhaps limit repeat viewings compared to previous Pixar fare. But studio was on sure ground bringing in Bird as the first ""outside"" filmmaker to be entrusted with a Pixar feature (Bird and studio creative topper John Lasseter were classmates years back at CalArts). Like ""Iron Giant"" ""The Incredibles"" reveals a deft hand at elevating ordinary life with extraordinary developments and betrays a resonant connection with the the-skys-the-limit ethos of late-50s-early-60s America. While zooming along without a bump in recounting the rehabilitation of a 50s superhero and his gifted family the film is strongly invested in a compelling theme an impassioned rejection of mediocrity. The slyly serious subtext here is that American society of the past 40 years or so has become increasingly tolerant of lower standards to the extent that those driven to excel such as superheroes have been discouraged even put out of business. Such is the case with Mr. Incredible (voiced with red-blooded gusto by Craig T. Nelson) who after a vigorous display of all-in-a-days work super deeds in the smashing opening sequence is sued for rescuing someone who didnt want to be saved and along with his equally capable bride Elastigirl (a smart and tart Holly Hunter) is banished to the governments superhero relocation program. Fifteen years later in what looks like the JFK early 60s the couple lives quietly in suburbia as Bob and Helen Parr he as a beleaguered and overweight insurance salesman shuffling claims across a tiny desk she as a harried homemaker and mother to moody pubescent daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell) full-of-beans son Dash (Spencer Fox) and infant Jack Jack. With the exception of the latter the whole family is blessed with super powers of various kinds broad-shouldered Bob is as strong as Superman Helen can bend and stretch like Silly Putty Violet is able to surround herself with an impenetrable force field bubbles and Dash can run as fast as Road Runner a talent he is frustratingly obliged to conceal while competing in school track meets. But like a druggie who needs his fix Bob is addicted to doing good and sneaks out some nights with buddy Lucius Best (Samuel L. Jackson) a former fellow superhero known as Frozone to listen to the police scanner and lend anonymous help. Although Bob and Lucius middle-age restlessness stems in part from wanting to relive their glory days the film goes deeper. ""They keep coming up with new ways to celebrate mediocrity"" Bob complains to his wife who has submerged her super ways more thoroughly than has her mate. In this new world the excellence represented by superheroes now seems like a lost and ancient cause. After being fired for excessive sympathy to his insurance clients Bob is summoned back into action by Mirage (Elizabeth Pena) a mysterious woman who jets him to a tropical island for what turns out to be a test battle against a ferocious tentacled robot. Back home Bob gets his lumpen body back in shape and in one of the films numerous priceless scenes goes to diminutive fashionista Edna ""E"" Mode (wonderfully voiced by Bird himself) to have a new costume designed one that at her insistence will not feature an annoying cape. Before Bob fully resumes his career as Mr. Incredible pic sketches a surprising and satisfying picture of the variable nature of the Parr familys life -- the adults enforced acceptance of lowered expectations their frisky intimate relationship Bobs chafing at restraints domestic and professional the childrens possession of skills theyre not allowed to use and therefore dont know how to channel. When the group ultimately unites on the volcanic island to battle evil together there is a genuine sense of family solidarity that gives the climax an extra dimension. Mr. Incredibles nemesis turns out to be Syndrome (Jason Lee) a flame-haired creep who in his youth was the strong mans biggest fan. ""You cant count on anyone especially your heroes"" Syndrome announces as he embarks upon his plan to destroy Mr. Incredible then launch a menacing robot into a major city only to arrive to save the day himself and be proclaimed the greatest superhero of all. Syndrome and his island sanctuary would be right at home in a James Bond film and ""The Incredibles"" has great fun playing with 60s spy film archetypes perhaps nowhere more so than in the fabulously John Barryesque score by Michael Giacchino the composer for TVs ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" as well as numerous videogames here making a smashing feature debut. Dismayed upon learning that her husband has surreptitiously reclaimed his former career Helen is persuaded by the scene-stealing Edna to do the same whereupon the picture kicks into high gear. The physical contortions of which the reborn Elastigirl is capable notably the amazing elongation of her limbs are eye-popping but the highlights arguably belong to little Dash for whom the lifting of speed limits results in a hilariously fast trip to the island and whose pursuit through the rain forest by razor-edged manned flying saucers out-does similar ""Star Wars"" scenes. Design-wise the film reinforces its 60s orientation with its Miesian cityscapes horizontal suburban box houses retro-futuristic architectural motifs and jazzy end credits. Always colorful and enjoyable just to look at pic has less outright showbiz pizzazz than the previous Pixar features but all their visual polish and finely honed storytelling skills. Script is so packed with wit and imagination on multiple levels that viewers of all ages will feel in on the joke. Voice talents excel across the boards with Nelson underlining the he-man heroics with latent vulnerability and frustrated aspirations Hunter adding a sexy edge to the housewife and Lee lending lip-smacking glee to the twerpy villain who thinks his day has finally arrived. Driving it all is the artistic impulse to live up to ones potential and not be cowed by perceived or imposed limitations. Fortunately its a sentiment conveyed without the slightest sanctimoniousness and one lived up to by the filmmakers and conveyed with rambunctious glee to the audience. Feature is being preceded in theatrical engagements by a new five-minute Pixar short ""Bouncin"" an engaging musical Western starring a jackalope and a shorn sheep that is most memorable for its amusing Dr. Seuss-like rhyming word schemes.

(AP Photo/Walt Disney Pictures/Pixar Animation) Just another nuclear family -- with super powers 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Incredibles Animation. Voiced by Craig T. Nelson Holly Hunter Jason Lee Samuel L. Jackson Sarah Vowell Elizabeth Pena Brad Bird. Directed and written by Bird. (PG. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). ""The Incredibles"" the latest animated wonder from Emeryvilles Pixar Animation Studios  will intrigue adults as well as 7-year-olds. In fact the adults might be more intrigued. Directed and written by Brad Bird (""The Iron Giant"") Pixars first PG- rated movie departs from its previous films like ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Toy Story. "" The visual and emotional hues are darker and the focus rests more on middle age than coming of age. The adventures of a family of superheroes are likely to thrill and amuse children but the films more grown-up themes might go over their heads. ""The Incredibles"" unfolds in the 1950s and 1960s showcasing Modernist architecture and tail-finned cars. The look is vintage comic book enhanced by computer technology deep rich reds and blues made sinister or bright via subtle shading. When the film starts it is the early 1950s and super-strong Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) is nabbing criminals and retrieving old ladies cats in a city thats part East Bay (San Pablo Avenue is mentioned) and part Gotham. Hes got plenty of company in the superhero ranks including his no-jointed sweetheart Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) rubber-banding her way across tall buildings. Flash-forward 15 years to the suburbs where the married superheroes live with three children. One is just a baby and the older two hyper-speed Dash and vanishing Violet are forbidden from using their special powers in public. So are their parents. Mr. Incredible stopped a speeding train from crashing and for his troubles got slapped with injury claims from survivors. A flood of similar lawsuits led to the banishment of superheroes forcing these fantastic four into a kind of Witness Protection Program and try to blend in. Birds insertion of 21st century cynicism into the films vintage setting is a nice touch a sly way of reminding us that even the good old days had their problems. A scene at the family dinner table proves the Pixar animators dont need fancy action scenes to work their magic. Teenager Violet and younger brother Dash get into a dustup. He whirls in her direction and she stops him cold with a force field she just created. Mom keeps things in check by extending her boneless arms to grab each kid. Dads at the table too but hes reading the newspaper and takes no notice. Heres where ""The Incredibles"" might lose the kiddies at least for a while. Mr. Incredible now just Bob Parr is in a funk. A superhero unable to save people he squeezes his bulk into a tiny desk at an insurance office and helps folks the only way he can -- by guiding them through the maze of insurance-company red tape. Hes supposed to deny their claims but his job hardly matters to him. (The film plays it both ways Frivolous lawsuits are bad but so are insurance companies). Heres where ""The Incredibles"" might lose the women Helen Parr the former Elastigirl doesnt miss saving the world the way her husband does. The little lady frankly is cramping Mr. Incredibles style by urging him to forget his glory days. Her desire to care for her family is admirable but she could at least yearn for the old days especially with the fiery Hunter voicing the character. When Helen finally gets some gumption it is almost but not quite too late. Bob tells his wife that he and fellow undercover superhero Mr. Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) are bowling when theyre really sneaking out to save people. A scene of the pair sitting in a car listening to a police scanner is somber in lighting and content. Parked in an alley these do-gooders look shady like they are the criminals. When a mystery figure contacts Bob to disarm a giant robot he jumps at the chance. Never mind that the mystery figure speaks through a sultry blond frontwoman (a husky-voiced Elizabeth Pena) and lives in a giant island compound the surest signs of villainy outside of an eye patch. Watching the now overweight superhero limber up with the rogue robot provides some excitement but Bob is also being selfish. He doesnt tell Helen what hes doing and he accepts more assignments working off his gut and buying a snazzy sports car in the process. Its a classic midlife crisis only minus the parts that are inappropriate for a kids film. ""The Incredibles"" puts its celebrity voices to good use. Jacksons exaggerated toughness fits Mr. Frozone a softie despite his tendency to spread ice wherever he goes. Jason Lee heightens his usual bratty nasal delivery as the villain revealed to be a red-haired pipsqueak. But theres also something to be said for less distinctive voices. Only devotees of the TV show ""Coach"" will link Nelson to Bob/Mr. Incredible and the result is a character who seems like a character and not the guy behind him -- a big flawed lug with a good heart and a soothing voice. Hunters coiled energy adds an extra charge to the sequence where Helen and the kids spring into action. These delightful scenes entail espionage foot chases and the unrestrained joy of young people finally allowed to unleash their potential. Sarah Vowell lends angst and shyness to Violet whose black hair and giant eyes belong in an anime film. This insecure teenager emerges as the most sympathetic member of the family. The showstopper however is more a caricature than a character. Bird shows his versatility by voicing Edna a pint-sized vaguely European fashionista bathed in black who designs the superheroes uniforms. Half snob and half den mother Edna accidentally/on purpose reveals secrets to Helen while unveiling special suits designed for the family (Violets disappears with her) at her sleek glass-and-steel house. How does Edna afford Architectural Digest-level digs with most superheroes out of commission? Wait . .. shes not real and neither is the house. Shes a cartoon character for gosh sakes. An animated film that has you wondering about house payments is an unusual animated film indeed. -- Advisory This film contains scenes of violence.

RELATED  A most Incredible villain YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Pixar Holly Hunter Craig T. Nelson or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? LOS ANGELES California (CNN) -- ""The Incredibles"" is -- yes -- incredible.Writer/director Brad Bird (""The Iron Giant"") and the wizards at Pixar Animation Studios (""Toy Story"" ""Monsters Inc"" and ""Finding Nemo"") have created a marvelous movie that works for children and adults on both an emotional and humorous level.This is the first time Pixar has used only human characters in a film and the result is a giant step forward in computer animation. ""The Incredibles"" offers a wonderful story brimming with social satire and clever metaphors all coming back to the importance of family.Rumor has it the film cost 145 million. Its money very well spent.The films clever premise is grounded in a world where superheroes are commonplace. Humans now take for granted being saved -- from any type of accident or force of nature -- on a daily basis by a caped crusader.The biggest hero of them all is the amazing Mr. Incredible voiced by the engaging Craig T. Nelson. Sharing the kudos -- and the headlines -- is the extremely flexible Elastigirl performed by Holly Hunter. (One of the wonders of the film is the way the animators have beautifully captured the way the actress speaks out of the side of her mouth which gives her character added spunk and charm.) The other main superhero of the day is Fronzone (who freezes water) voiced by the ever-terrific Samuel L. Jackson.But humans -- being human -- arent satisfied with just having their necks saved by these socially conscious heroes. As the old saying goes ""no good deed ever goes unpunished"" and people start to sue their rescuers for property damage and the like. The superheroes are forced into a relocation program pose as mere mortals or suffer dire consequences.Mr. Incredible whos always had a thing for Elastigirl pops the question and they head off to suburbia. They become Bob and Helen Parr and years go by.Off to save the worldNature takes its course; they now have three children and the familys individual sources of power have become delightfully witty send-ups of their real personalities.Dad reduced to anything but incredible is struggling to do what is best for the family. Mom is the multi-tasking mother who is forced to ""stretch"" herself in order to care for her demanding brood. The two oldest children voiced by Sarah Vowell and Spencer Fox are young Violet (as in shrinking) a shy teenager with the ability to disappear and son Dash (who can naturally move at supersonic speed) a stereotypically hyperactive little boy. Young Jack-Jack (voiced by Eli Fucile) has powers yet to be determined. Those darned villains Syndrome causes problems for the family.Suddenly Bob is summoned to a remote location in order to take part in a top-secret mission to -- what else -- save the world.Every action-adventure movie needs a despicable villain and Jason Lee provides ample venom as Buddy Pine also known as Syndrome.But thats enough information except to say that the rest of the film -- like any good tale -- keeps you guessing until the very end. The family struggles to overcome many obstacles while proving that staying together -- no matter what the cost -- is all that matters.Magical""The Incredibles"" is more than just an entertaining family tale. The film riffs on action and spy films particularly James Bond. Indeed its most delightful character Edna Mode (voiced by Bird himself in a wonderfully deadpan performance) is a clothing designer for superheroes -- a clever spin on Q the high-tech equipment supplier in the Bond films.Edna is an unlikely combination of Coco Chanel Yoko Ono and George Patton. Edna determines what the superheroes will wear thereby deciding their public image. Shes a diva on steroids without a shred of self-doubt and she single-handedly pushes the films humor into overdrive when she enters the scene.The people at Pixar have done it again. Theyve married state-of-the-art computer animation to great storytelling and have delivered a unique film full of heart pathos and an unfailing faith in the triumph of good over evil.The ability to entertain people of all ages with the same film is rare gift but ""The Incredibles"" stays right on target. In Hollywood thats beyond incredible. Thats cinematic magic.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Pixar that is. As in the most inspired animation house in the United States. Their movie this time is ""The Incredibles"" and its well incredible. Funny. Inspired. Superbo animation. (Thats superb and turbo combined.) Its easily the best and brightest family-friendly movie of the year. Not that you need a family to enjoy this. You could take someone elses kids. Or just go yourself. Pixars ""The Incredibles"" featuring a nuclear family of super strength will appeal to kids and adults.

Nelson) who is being interviewed on-camera about his superhero life. His face looms large in the camera looking just a little bit nuts for a second. He retracts his head with a just-kidding smile. See Mr. Incredible (whos actually a mild-mannered guy named Bob Parr behind that mask) tends to be a little over the top when it comes to saving people. Trying to talk a kitty out of a tree and also keeping an eye on an escaping perp he uproots the trunk to shake the cat out. Then he uses the tree to sideswipe the bad guys car. Hey its effective. Unfortunately these and other stunts -- not only from Mr. Incredible but other superheroes in the neighborhood -- are freaking people out. Lawsuits are flying. The result Bob and his wife Helen (Holly Hunter) who moonlights incognito as the superhero Elastigirl are forced to skip town under the Superhero Relocation Program. Same goes for all caped crusaders including Bobs pal Lucius (Samuel L. Jackson) whose alter ego is Frozone an icemaking agent of good. Cut to 15 years later. Bob now a slightly tubby insurance claims adjuster with a new identity and existence heads a family of budding mini-heroes. But the kids have been forbidden to reveal their talents. On no account must lightning-quick son Dash (Spencer Fox) win those foot races or indulge in that rapid-speed practical joking. And Violet (Sarah Vowell) must never never show off her powers of invisibility. Being normal -- what a freakin drag. Its hard for Bob too. He and Lucius have taken to sneaking out at night eavesdropping on the police radio and surreptitiously kicking a little criminal butt. So Bobs all ears when a slinky number named Mirage (Elizabeth Pena) invites him on a special mission -- superheroic of course. When Dad sneaks off on a secret mission and lies about what hes doing whats a family to do except follow? Writer-director Brad Bird an executive consultant for ""The Simpsons"" ""The Critic"" and ""King of the Hill"" who also made the rather wonderful ""Iron Giant"" has aced himself. The film brims over with hilarious sight gags and witticisms. Bobs company Insuricon has its own special motto ""Your life is in our hands."" And at one point the villain in the movie (whose identity I wont divulge) starts talking maniacally about the bad things he has in store for the captured Bob when he suddenly stops himself and says ""You caught me monologuing"" Beyond the sophisticated humor theres something for almost every conceivable viewer. Mom Dad daughter and son all get a major bite of the action. What could be more appealing than an entire family not only empowered but super-empowered? Now heres a caveat. There is definitely a lot of smash and crash in that action. The Incredibles get quite a workout fighting a big intimidating robot that smashes giant potholes in the ground and is bent on destroying them. This pugilistic intensity might not be good for the sensitive or very young. Of course it will thrill the instant-gratification element. Okay Im talking about boys. I throw myself before the Board of Political Correction without legal representation but Im confident most people are going to have a great time. The off-screen voices are terrific too. Even and perhaps especially in animation performance is the real chemical ingredient. Thats the final act of animation -- the putting of life into the images. Nelson makes a wonderfully amusing Bob bighearted and just a little goofy. And Jackson makes much of his supporting role as Frozone. But for my money the real revelation is Hunter as Helen. Shes a warm husky-voiced mom who stands her ground and gives you a sense that this family is really worth loving and fighting for. Thats not bad for a take-home message. THE INCREDIBLES (PG 115 minutes) -- Contains some intense action fare. Area theaters.

Its electrifying Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) tries to think his way out of a tough situation. Disney/ Pixar Though not as endearing as Finding Nemo or as cheeky as Shrek 2 the film is a raucous adventure that celebrates the joys and messy complexities of family life. The animation has a unique style artfully blending a futuristic quality with a retro 50s look. (Related video See a preview of The Incredibles) The Incredibles are a nuclear family of reformed superheroes now living in the burbs. The paterfamilias is insurance claims adjuster Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) once known as Mr. Incredible a do-good strongman until he was sued by someone he saved from jumping off a building. That action led to a flurry of lawsuits against superheroes that sent most of them into hiding. Mr. Incredible and his wife Elastigirl aka Helen Parr (Holly Hunter) were forced into the witness protection program and compelled to lead normal lives. About the movie The Incredibles    (out of four) Stars Craig T. Nelson Holly Hunter Samuel L. Jackson Jason Lee Directors Brad Bird Distributor Buena Vista Rated PG for action violence Opens Friday nationwide For Bob its a life of quiet desperation. He tries to be a hero in the insurance arena and repeatedly clashes with his by-the-book boss. Bob and Helen have three children a moody teenage daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell); young son Dash (Spencer Fox); and toddler Jack-Jack. Violets alter ego allows her to become invisible and Dash is so speedy that his mother wont allow him to go out for sports and blow the familys cover. Jack-Jacks gift hasnt been revealed. ""Right now the world just wants us to fit in"" Helen explains to her children. When Bob suddenly is given the opportunity to save the world again as Mr. Incredible he jumps at the chance. But it turns out to be a trap and the Incredible/Parr family must use their powers to thwart the evil plot. The movies most indelible character is Edna Mode a quirky fashion designer to the superheroes seemingly modeled on legendary costumer Edith Head and voiced hilariously by Incredibles mastermind Brad Bird who wrote and directed the movie. If theres a sequel Edna should star. Although the story is well written simultaneously funny and sweet it bogs down toward the end. Clocking in at 115 minutes it feels about 15 minutes too long. And it does have some intense cartoon violence that might not be appropriate for children under 6. The Incredibles is composed of equal parts pulse-racing action and heart with a family-friendly but never cloying message.

"The incredible Incredibles. Slate Sign In Sign Up The incredible Incredibles. The incredible Incredibles. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 4 2004 643 PM Reality Bytes The Incredibles succeeds where most fantasy movies fail. By David Edelstein Incredibles believable Theres a scene in David Cronenbergs The Fly (1986) when Jeff Goldblum teleports a raw steak from one test pod to another and fries it up for Geena Davis who spits it out frowns and says it ""tastes fake."" Thats a pretty good metaphor for most big-budget Hollywood fantasy pictures of the last five years which attempt to synthesize reality but are notably lacking in what philosophers call ""ontological authenticity."" The new batch of Star Wars pictures the Mummy movies that visual lollapalooza Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow You just know youre watching computer animation billions of ones and zeroes trying to pass themselves off as matter. And now from Pixar and writer-director Brad Bird comes a startling crossover point The Incredibles (Walt Disney) a 100 percent artificial movie thats made with so much wit such cinematic savvy and such a brilliant instinct for the way real bodies--not to mention patently unreal superhero bodies--move through space that it has more ontological authenticity than a lot of films featuring people who actually exist. A computer-animated kiddie comedy about superheroes ought to be doubly unreal. But Bird begins with his superheroes being interviewed by an unseen documentarian with a handheld-camera and they go in and out of focus as they get excited and the cameraman tries to keep them in the frame. Clever This is another trend in modern fantasy from the last Spider-Man picture to Comedy Centrals satirical superhero ""reality show"" Drawn Together bringing our pop-culture legends down to earth by having them discourse mundanely about their mythic jobs. So even though these are 3-D computer-animated figures with obvious synthetic skin and impossible powers they move react and talk like real people. Nothing inspires suspension of disbelief like recognizable human behavior. Advertisement Our hero is Bob Parr aka Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig Nelson) an anvil-jawed red-leotarded guy with a swollen torso on relatively small bowed legs. Mr. Incredible tells the unseen interviewer hes at the top of his game yessir. And he proves it by taking out a series of ordinary criminals and super-villains and stopping a Chicago El train before it plunges off some demolished tracks. His only serious obstacle is a rival superhero called Elastigirl (voiced by Holly Hunter) who has a sassy Southern toughness and limbs that can stretch for yards. The pair trade insults then rush off to a wedding ceremony--their own. The conceit of The Incredibles is that the superheroes come under fire for causing instead of preventing chaos so theyre relocated and forced to blend in like people in witness protection programs. Fifteen years later Mr. Incredible is incredibly fat and working in insurance. He and his fellow incognito pal Lucius aka Frozone (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) sneak off to relive the glory days and rescue a few people surreptitiously. But Mr. Incredibles biggest challenges are his and Elastigirls superkids a boy Dash who can do just that at supersonic speeds; and a morbid girl Violet with a force-field to die for and a curtain of black hair that according to my press notes was very hard to animate. (Public radio listeners will recognize Violets voice as belonging to This American Life regular Sarah Vowell.) The pressure is on to keep the kids from revealing how exceptional they are--until Mr. Incredible gets sucked back into the game by a slinky femme fatale called Mirage and the family finally gets to use its superpowers in tandem. Theres nothing profound here The Incredibles is a pop-culture parody a couple of cuts above a sitcom. But its so funny so gorgeous and finally so moving when the superhero family gets to bust out and do what they were designed to do that it transcends its sometimes conventional thinking. If you saw his great The Iron Giant you know that Bird has an amazing eye--a knack for infusing near-photo-realism with satire. He clearly worships at the altar of Steven Spielberg and his virtuosity is in the same league. The dimensionality the retro-futurist architecture the James Bond pastiche score and the settings that rival Ken Adams in You Only Live Twice Everything works like gangbusters. Bird even gives his voice to the most hilarious character Edna Mole a German Japanese superhero-costume designer who looks like a cross between Linda Hunt and Yoko Ono and whose illustrated riff on the impracticality of superhero capes will have you choking for the next five minutes. Quibbles? The Incredibles is very very loud and maybe too kinetic for the littlest kids. And the message feels a tad out of date. Dont suppress your childrens uniqueness to make them fit in it says Let them be exceptional Well that might have been progressive in the conformist 50s (when The Iron Giant is set) but nowadays parents are inclined not just to let their children be ""unique"" but to exploit the hell out of their gifts. My other reservation is more a declaration of bias I spent time during The Incredibles thinking how it might play with real actors--something that never occurs to me during my favorite animated films. My taste runs to animation totally unfettered by the laws of time and space animation that flouts ontological reality Spirited Away The Triplets of Belleville even the squash-and-stretch universe of Bugs Bunny and SpongeBob SquarePants. For all its wizardry The Incredibles isnt among my favorite animated movies. Weirdly enough I think of it instead as one of my favorite live-action superhero pictures.

Nelson Holly Hunter Samuel L. Jackson Jason Lee Spencer Fox Sarah Vowell. Written and directed by Brad Bird. 115 minutes. Rated PG for action violence. Several theaters. Mr. Incredible better known to his suburban neighbors as Bob (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) has the kind of problems we dont usually see superheroes struggling with. A married father of three hes facing middle age and his gut isnt as trim as it once was. (In tights hes not a pretty sight.) In his day job as an insurance man the voluminous barrel-chested Bob is painfully wedged into a cubicle (size extra-small with a pillar in it); in his little squarish car his blocky head is squished up against the ceiling. Its tough for a superhero to fit into the regular world. Likewise Bobs wife Helen (aka Elastigirl voiced by Holly Hunter) constantly reminds their children to keep their superpowers hidden. She has to remember not to use her infinite stretchiness to help the universe and her children Dash and Violet are warned to keep their astonishing speed and invisibility respectively inside the family. (The baby Jack Jack shows no signs of superherodom ... so far.) They are you see part of a superhero relocation program living as regular folks. Except that theyre not regular and they know it -- and so does Syndrome an old superhero nemesis waiting for his moment. ""The Incredibles"" is action-adventure family-style -- and because its from the warmhearted geniuses at Pixar Animation Studios (makers of the ""Toy Story"" movies ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monsters Inc."") its got a dash of sweetness too. Written and directed by Brad Bird -- who also provides the films funniest voice work as superhero costume designer Edna Mode (""No capes"") -- its a zippy journey in which goodness prevails and the ultimate superpower is familial love. As if anticipating that its target audience is growing up a bit ""The Incredibles"" is aimed at a slightly older crowd than the previous Pixar movies -- small children may be confused by the plot fidgety by the two-hour length or alarmed by the occasionally violent subject matter. (Though mild by Saturday-morning-cartoon standards ""The Incredibles"" does show a bit of gunfire and its child heroes must survive some peril.) But the happy 9-year-old with me pronounced it ""the best movie Ive ever seen"" -- and being a movie critics discerning nephew he doesnt say that lightly. Its filled with the kind of funny detail that has become a Pixar trademark. Early on Mr. Incredible takes on a French cat burglar named Bomb Voyage. Bobs employer the monolithic Insuricare is run by a burbling little man (voiced by Wallace Shawn) who furious that Bob is helping clients get payments thunders ""The customers are penetrating the bureaucracy"" Poor Bob while fighting an adversary throws his back out. But ""The Incredibles"" is at its best at its depiction of family life -- and it turns out that superheroes are just like the rest of us. On a journey to fight the forces of evil Dash and Violet whine ""Are we there yet?"" Mom/Elastigirl interrupts her mission to check in with the baby-sitter. And though Mr. Incredible is the marquee name Helen and the kids prove every bit as resourceful. Dumped into the sea from an exploded plane Mom stretches herself into a boat with young Dashs kicking as a motor. Watch her face in this scene Shes giving the kid a dont-mess-with-me-now look that any moms sure to recognize. As with any Pixar movie the animation is vivid funny and often breathtaking. (The team had fun with human shapes this time around Note Bobs lantern jaw Helens baby weight and Violets skinny teenage limbs.) This movie will make a fortune and deserves it -- in the movie world Bird and the Pixar team are the best kind of superheroes.

Sign Up > Facebook Twitter Follow laweekly Other David Chute Pixar Apotheosis Thursday November 4 2004 at 12 a.m. By David Chute A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In the latest Pixar extravaganza The Incredibles CGI digital animation seems finally to be settling into its proper niche somewhere between old-fashioned ""analog"" animation and live action. The vast mechanics of the hardware and software needed to produce such simulacra has by now become flexible and responsive enough to be manipulated on a whim and taken just as lightly. This second animated feature written and directed by The Iron Giants Brad Bird strikes the best balance yet between the forms two poles of cartoonish stylization and three-dimensional solidity. While it doesnt succumb to the temptation of trying to make its human characters photo-realistic these hypertrophied caricatures -- a family of superheroes living incognito in the suburbs and pretending to be ordinary -- do have soulful eyes and plausible body language. They are also surprisingly distinct personalities who happen to wear matching crimson leotards. I will admit I groaned as the Parrs so-called were dragged out of retirement by some creaky non-digital plot mechanics to save the world ""one more time"" rather like the plucky Cortez clan in Spy Kids. But The Incredibles isnt just a wisecracking parody of a world-rescuing adventure thriller -- its the real thing with chase sequences so fast and twisty youll have to pry your fingers off the armrests. The movie conveys more zest for the sheer sensuous charge of a good thriller than any live-action movie in years. So much so that the scenes of Parr clansters Bob (Craig T. Watson) Helen (Holly Hunter) Violet and Dash fighting as one on a jungle island when their various clashing superpowers finally begin to rhyme and reinforce one another carry a stronger sense of their bonds of affection as a family than the earlier more conventional scenes around the dinner table standard sitcom material embellished with some clever visual tomfoolery. Paradoxically its when the Parrs are most cartoonish especially in the action sequences that they become most expressively human sometimes when we least expect it. The composer Michael Giacchino who works on the TV shows Alias and Lost seems to be channeling 007-era John Barry and when Bob (a.k.a. Mr. Incredible) a top-heavy giant with a sledgehammer jaw and a receding hairline sneaks into the island lair of a self-made supermeanie he doesnt do it on tippy-toe like a Chuck Jones wabbit but with the confident movements of a full-grown hero letting a sense of danger wash over him as he blossoms out of his midlife crisis.

Sep. 13 600pm Some sequences recall the anything-for-a-guffaw strategy of the CGI films that laid the groundwork for Birds accomplishment particularly Finding Nemo in which each new fish had a polished vaudeville routine. But in The Incredibles even a crowd-pleasing showboat character like Edna Mode a miniature pug dog of a Eurotrash fashion designer (played with obvious relish by Bird himself) feels like a yappy distraction. The Incredibles really is an animated movie It does its best work on the fly when its moving almost too fast to follow. If it has a moral it is that there is nothing to be gained by putting a lid on your talents and that ""Saying everyone is special is another way of saying no one is."" (The evil scheme of the films villain is to hand out mechanical enhancements that will make everybody ""super."") Platitudes aside when rambunctious kid brother Dash (for ""Dashiell"") Parr finally gets to uncork the hyperspeed hes had to conceal while living in the burbs it isnt just an empty thrill ride; its an eruption of the life force. The Incredibles creates so seamless a mood of exhilaration that we resent being pulled out of it.
