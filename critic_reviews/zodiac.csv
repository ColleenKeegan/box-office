Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Paramount Pictures Robert Downey Jr. (left) and Jake Gyllenhaal star as San Francisco Chronicle journalists on the trail of the Zodiac killer in David Finchers new film. Paramount Pictures Learn about amateur sleuths who are still tracking the Zodiac killer. Partly because of the stylized visuals he brought with him from the world of music videos and partly because of the violent subject matter in the films Seven Fight Club and Panic Room David Fincher is widely considered one of Hollywoods most inventive suspense-film directors. The filmmakers fan base now amounts to a cult following with some viewers seeing his movies dozens of times. And in Zodiac which is based on a real-life San Francisco horror story Fincher seems intent on providing his fans with new reasons for multiple viewings. A murder on a lovers lane gets Zodiac off to a pulse-pounding start. Finchers camera then takes us on a tour -- not of the crime scene nor of the police investigation -- but of the offices of the San Francisco Chronicle on Aug. 1 1969. Its not an aimless tour. The camera is charting the arrival that day of a letter that bears a symbol where the return address should be. The letter claims credit for the murder weve just seen as well as another one offering details and demanding front-page play for a weird cipher -- a coded message -- to prevent further deaths. The Chronicles crime reporter Paul Avery makes a phone call to the police and confirms that the details are right. And a two-decade mystery begins. The killer would soon be known as the Zodiac and though all the newspapers give him coverage he kills again and again each time sending more ciphers. The symbols intrigue the Chronicles cartoonist Robert Graysmith who hovers around the reporters desk deciphering and offering explanations he has gleaned at the library. Watching him youll detect something a little obsessive about his interest in the story which means youre getting the films drift. The real Robert Graysmith got so caught up in the Zodiac murders that he quit cartooning to write the two books on which this movie is based. Graysmiths onscreen alter ego played by Jake Gyllenhaal seems so tightly wound that the filmmakers thought it worth noting at the end that the real Graysmith now has a healthy relationship with his children -- a character reference you wont find in most films. Obsession is the movies theme a driving force for the killer the guys trying to catch him and of course for the filmmaker who is nothing if not a stickler for detail. In his earlier pictures Fincher amped up the emotions as he went for your jugular. Here hes all about what the police think they know and why they think they know it evidence procedure reconstruction at the crime scenes. Fincher is so good at keeping info-crammed dialogue crackling that a whole raft of really smart actors have signed on to work with him Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards as homicide detectives; Robert Downey Jr. making the crime reporters boozy paranoia look alarmingly lived-in; Brian Cox hamming it up as showboat lawyer Melvin Belli. All of them are sharp and period-perfect in a film that doesnt just get the 70s cars and sideburns right but that actually brings back the style of 70s detective flicks. There are no tidy last-minute plot twists to make you feel good in Finchers Zodiac just focus -- to keep an audience focused -- and the most disciplined filmmaking youve seen in forever.

Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Paramount Pictures Bonus Audio Leslie Harper on Her Amateur-Sleuth Parents Toggle more options Embed Embed Author Robert Graysmith Toggle more options Embed Embed The premiere Friday of David Finchers film Zodiac is renewing interest in a series of Bay Area murders in the late 1960s. But for some people the mystery of the Zodiac killer has been a years-long obsession -- one that will persist until the case is solved. The Zodiac killer terrorized the San Francisco area with his murders occurring in the evening at parking lots or other quiet areas. He taunted police and local media with letters and cryptograms boasting of his crimes. At one point he threatened to kill children on school buses. The Zodiac has claimed responsibility for 37 murders though the actual confirmed number of victims is five. Four of the victims were couples parked in a car together shot and stabbed to death. The other victim was a cab driver. The killer has never been identified but theories about possible suspects abound a Manson family member ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski a San Francisco businessman dubbed Mr. X and a man named Arthur Leigh Allen who died in 1992. A community of amateur sleuths remains fascinated with the case poring over details and visiting crime scenes. One follower of the murders Tom Voigt says his Web site has led to contacts with people involved in the case. Now even police acknowledge that Voigts site -- which has 5000 pages and about 10000 individual images -- is the main clearinghouse for Zodiac material. Voigt earns a living by doing computer work but most of his free time is spent on Zodiac-related pursuits. He says he has spent 75000 investigating the case over the last 10 years. John Mikulenka has made a documentary about amateur Zodiac detectives Hunting the Zodiac. It will debut Saturday at the 2007 Zodiackiller.com Task-Force Meeting in San Francisco.

David Finchers movies have always had this flavour The Game Panic Room Fight Club Alien3 are all cat-and-mouse affairs of one kind or another; Se7en proposed multiple murder as literary pop quiz. Zodiac isnt a puzzle film in quite that way; instead its subject is the compulsion to solve puzzles and its coup is the creeping recognition quite contrary to the flow of crime cinema of how fruitless that compulsion can be.Stretching from 1969 to 1991 the film is based on the series of killings that petrified San Francisco during the 70s and more specifically on the book written about them by Robert Graysmith. Played by a typically puppyish Jake Gyllenhaal Graysmith was a San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist whose fascination with the murders engendered a kind of partnership with foppishly dissolute crime editor Paul Avery (a wrapped gift of a part for Robert Downey Jr) mirrored in the investigations of police detectives Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards. Portraying the Zodiacs attack on a young couple in a car in a deserted make-out spot the opening scene - one of several bravura suspense sequences - cant help but recall slasher convention; the investigation that follows seems like a pacey procedural. But the clues dont quite fit together the solution doesnt come and as procedure sprawls into obsession the tone shifts from genre picture to something more like curious observation - sometimes sympathetic sometimes almost mocking - of the refusal to let go. Perhaps some puzzles should be set aside.

Credit BARRY BLITT As any aisle-hugging aesthete will tell you the look feel and form of a film are just as important as its ""themes."" Indeed the thematic material of a movie can no more easily be separated from the cinematic means that produce it than melodies can be separated from notes. Still critics do it. Readers we tell ourselves have the right to know what a movie is ostensibly about. So I would have to say that Ken Loachs wonderful ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" which won the Palme dOr at Cannes last May is about a savage little corner of the Irish rebellion against the British in the years 1920 to 1922; that more particularly its about two brothers from County Cork who fight the vicious English counter-revolutionary force the Black and Tans but then part company over the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 which established the Irish Free State but preserved its dependent status as a ""dominion"" within the British Empire. One brother Damien (Cillian Murphy) wants complete separation from the United Kingdom and a socialist revolution in Ireland; the other Teddy (Padraic Delaney) is willing to accept the treaty as the best possible outcome for the moment. The British are gone (except from Northern Ireland) but revolutionary solidarity among the Irish collapses into civil war. Theres our theme the revolution devours its children. But even as I write these words I know that they barely touch whats onscreen. Ken Loach an old-line social realist years ago made studies of English working-class life ""Poor Cow"" and ""Kes"" that were well received here but in recent times his earnestness has worked as a damper. He had become so serious a man that you felt abashed if you saw his movies guilty if you skipped them. Yet ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" (the prolix title comes from an old Irish revolutionary song) is a beautifully realized work and perhaps Loachs best film. He and the cinematographer Barry Ackroyd have produced a slightly dark saturated color palette that preserves the raw dampness of the Irish weather the even gray light the flintiness of the stone cottages. The hilly landscapes are lovely without being picturesque (none of that travel-ad Irish green); the interiors are illuminated by natural light seeping through the windows without the usual artificial ""fill"" that pulls faces or corners of rooms out of the shadows. What Loach has produced working with a script by Paul Laverty is an anti-spectacular spectacle the British military cars tin lizzies carrying men in the open are almost comically antique and vulnerable; the I.R.A. rebels who wear awkward long coats and caps as they scramble over a hill look less like a guerrilla force than like fellows who had planned to go shopping with their families but somehow got sidetracked into a bizarre adventure. The movies power derives from what can only be called under-staging. When the Black and Tans storm into the yard of a Republican family they line the young men up against a wall; the English soldiers are contemptuous of the Irish--they think they know these people these troublemakers and they treat them with coarse intimacy. Yet the brutality has an oddly spasmodic unpatterned feeling one soldier may be nearly insane with rage while the others stand around blank-faced not sure how they should behave. The young Irish men are sullenly silent too as their mothers and sisters lunge distractedly toward them to protect them then get shoved out of the way by the soldiers. Loach isnt trying for gracefulness or even clarity; hes trying for his own kind of scrappy truthfulness in which pent-up physical violence bursts out clumsily. Loachs violence doesnt have the stylized glamour of classic movie mayhem; it has the look of surprise. Cillian Murphy with his full lips and fine-boned face--he was the charming sinister seducer in the neat little thriller ""Red Eye"" and the sweet cross-dresser in ""Breakfast on Pluto""--might seem to be an odd choice for a revolutionary but the point about Damien is that hes a mild man who has been groomed for a refined life (as a London doctor) only to get dragged into war. Murphy is normally very quiet in movies; he has attained his mystique as an actor by staring at people with baby-blue eyes. In this film too he has at times a deep stillness but he has idiosyncratic moments as well such as when Damien has to execute a teen-ager who has ratted on the I.R.A. Murphy writhing shoots the boy and stumbles away nausea struggling against duty. The rest of Loachs actors however dont engage the camera with their eyes which is generally how performers bring attention to themselves in movies. Instead heads down they stick to the clandestine business at hand delivering messages arguing in late-night meetings hurtling through barely lit corridors. Its an exciting film but Laverty and Loach demonstrate again and again that revolutionary violence with its demand for internal discipline and purity is inherently tragic. In the end Damien cant accept the Anglo-Irish compromise because hes committed acts such as killing the boy that would become meaningless if he lessened the absoluteness of his goals. That hes wrong or that his brother is wrong to threaten him with execution isnt really the issue the inexorability of the revolutionary process has caught both of them in its spiralling steel coils. Revising my statement of what ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" is about I would say that its a sombrely beautiful dream of the violent Irish past. Refusing the standard flourishes of Irish wildness or lyricism Loach has made a film for our moment a time of bewildering internecine warfare. The great film critic Manny Farber once praised what he called ""termite art"" by which he meant the kind of small stubborn movie that chews its way through a narrow piece of turf. David Finchers ""Zodiac"" is mollusk art the movie keeps elaborating itself out of its own discharge hardening its emotions anxieties and energies into a shell of obsession. Fincher working with a fantastically detailed script by the young James Vanderbilt chronicles the case of the self-identified Zodiac killer a taunting publicity-mad creep who murdered at least five people in the San Francisco Bay area in the late nineteen-sixties and sent confessional notes about the crimes (sometimes in code) to newspapers. Fincher puts two of the murders right near the beginning of the movie both of them as sustained in their terror as anything he did in his notorious serial-killer movie ""Se7en"" (1995) which featured deliquescing corpses. But then astonishingly ""Zodiac"" becomes not another thriller or horror show but a multifaceted procedural that divides its narrative attention between the Police Department where two hardworking cops (Anthony Edwards and Mark Ruffalo) keep coming up with false leads and the San Francisco Chronicle where an ace crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and the newspapers cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) who has a talent for puzzles devote their lives to the search for the killer. Moving swiftly but with precise attention to the emotional coloring of such things as weather and light and dour institutional spaces Fincher runs through interrogations trips to the library the sorting and matching of mounds of evidence. Fincher has changed direction. The creator of the nutty sub-fascist ""Fight Club"" and the dumb fright movie ""Panic Room"" has suddenly devoted himself to (of all things) manners and jurisdictional niceties--the way people talk to one another in a newspaper office the hassles over evidence between the police of one city and those of another. He has discovered the everyday working world and hes fascinated by its moods and small tensions its endless give-and-take. ""Zodiac"" is superbly made but its also a strange piece of work. As the bad tips and the dubious suspects pile up one Zodiac investigator after another devoured by the hunt or merely bored leaves the case or retires. Only Graysmith whose two books about Zodiac served as the basis for the picture keeps going but he brings his kids into the investigation and breaks up his marriage and comes off as a selfish nut. As ""Zodiac"" goes on and on and it becomes clear that no denouement is possible (the crime was never solved) we have to ask what the reason for all this cinematic blind-alleying might be. Any honest neurotic could probably tell you the emotional payoff of an obsession is not attaining some longed-for goal--its the obsession itself which fulfills certain needs. If it didnt it wouldnt be an obsession. Graysmith whom no one takes seriously at first wants to prove himself as a sleuth perhaps but his real need is to be absorbed in the search. For Fincher I would guess the identity of the killer is less important than the vast effort of almost (but not quite) finding him. He teaches us--and we absorb the lesson uneasily--that truth like some vision that recedes as we draw near it will never quite yield to our most ardent pursuit.

"Zodiac The surprisingly cerebral new thriller from David Fincher. Slate Sign In Sign Up Zodiac The surprisingly cerebral new thriller from David Fincher. Zodiac The surprisingly cerebral new thriller from David Fincher. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 2 2007 641 PM No Guts No Gory David Finchers Zodiac is surprisingly cerebral. By Dana Stevens Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr. in Zodiac David Fincher is starting to create quite a little oeuvre for himself a pitch-dark body of work obsessed with the problem of theodicy--the justification of the existence of evil in the world. Se7en (1995) took the serial-killer procedural to absurd yet strangely haunting depths of existential gloom. Morgan Freemans closing line in that movie--""Ernest Hemingway once said The world is a fine place and worth fighting for. I agree with the second part.""--could serve as an epigraph for the rest of the directors work.  Finchers protagonists live in a dank brutal senseless world but they go down fighting whether its Brad Pitts impulsive cop in Se7en Edward Nortons Jekyll-and-Hyde schlemiel in Fight Club or now Jake Gyllenhaals single-minded amateur sleuth in Finchers newest film Zodiac (Paramount) which opened today. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The real-life story of the Zodiac killer is the most Fincherian of murder mysteries a still-unsolved string of brutal killings in California beginning in 1969 and stretching across the next decade or more (no one really knows how many murders the Zodiac was responsible for since he may have claimed credit for crimes he didnt commit). An unparalleled media manipulator the killer sent handwritten notes to the press with threats that eerily presage the faceless terrorism of our own age Publish this coded message on the front page the Zodiac warns in one note or I just might wipe out a busload of schoolchildren. Advertisement Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith the newspaper cartoonist at the San FranciscoChronicle who turned himself into an amateur Zodiac expert publishing two books on the murders that served as the basis for James Vanderbilts densely detailed script. His colleague and half-unwilling collaborator in the investigation is an alcoholic crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr. whos gone from being a brilliant rogue with addiction issues to playing them fabulously on screen). Mark Ruffalo is Dave Toschi a dogged police detective who in real life inspired both Steve McQueens Bullitt and Clint Eastwoods Dirty Harry (though Ruffalo seems to be channeling Peter Falk here complete with rumpled raincoat and head-scratching doorknob inquiries). The huge and very effective supporting cast includes Anthony Edwards as Toschis partner Chloe Sevigny as Graysmiths nerdy wife and John Carroll Lynch as Arthur Leigh Allen a creepy pedophile whos one of the prime Zodiac suspects despite a lack of hard physical evidence. Beware Se7en fans looking for an imaginatively dispatched new victim every 15 minutes After a few harrowing early scenes almost all the violence happens off-screen with the focus not on the terror of the killings but on the grinding day-to-day frustration of the cops and reporters trying to stop them. Zodiac is a cerebral often bone-dry police procedural that demands close attention from the viewer. It takes us down blind alleys that in a fictional cops-and-bad-guys movie would count as red herrings. In the re-creation of the real police investigation of a still-open case of course that misdirection is crucial to the story. Zodiacs labyrinthine plot feels at times like a cross between a trip to the library and a visit to the DMV Bureaucratic squabbles about police jurisdiction are as important as blood-spatter patterns and bullet trajectories. But the movies power is that it makes us all into Robert Graysmiths obsessive wonks keen to solve the Zodiacs riddle. Graysmith himself remains something of a cipher--why did he care so much about the case that he risked his wife and children in order to pursue it?--but ultimately Zodiac is a movie about the search itself not the psychology of the seeker. Vanderbilts script moves so quickly from one information-crammed scene to the next that its tough to keep up at times but it also crackles with a grim wit. Fielding a phone call from the self-dubbed Zodiac lawyer Marvin Belli (Brian Cox) asks him ""Is there something I could call you thats a little less ominous?"" And without ever pressing its point Zodiac reminds us of the mediatized technologized era in which we find ourselves--an era that even as the Zodiac killer foreshadowed it arrived too late to catch him. The means by which Graysmith eventually homes in on the killer (or the man who perhaps wrongly he believes is the killer) are so heartbreakingly low-tech you want to travel back in time with your laptop and give him a hand. Zodiac is long--over two and a half hours--but when its over you almost wish it had gone on for another 20 minutes just to see every end get tied up. But of course all the ends are never tied up in real life even when the murderer is found. To undertake a thriller of this length and scope with no prospect of a morally satisfying resolution Fincher must have been a little nuts himself. Well see whether audiences used to the tidy one-hour cases on CSI and Law amp; Order will follow him down Zodiacs murky twisted and ultimately dead-end street. It may not sound like it from that description but its a hell of a ride.

Zodiac Killer thriller | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesZodiac Killer thrillerThings dont add up in David Finchers mesmerizing but artfully maddening Zodiac but thats the point. This account of the 15-year hunt for the never-apprehended serial killer who inspired the lunatic sniper in Dirty Harry is on to something thats considerably more unsettling than the fear of the unknown and thats the fear of the unknowable.Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Duffy Jennings (Adam Goldberg) try to solve the Zodiac killer case in <i>Zodiac.</i>By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. March 2 2007Starring Jake Gyllenhaal Mark Ruffalo Robert Downey Jr. Anthony Edwards Brian Cox Elias Koteas Chloe Sevigny. Written by James Vanderbilt. Directed by David Fincher. 153 minutes. At major theatres. 14AOpening with a ruthlessly efficient sequence involving the murder of a young couple in a parked car in 1969 the movie immediately plunges into what will eventually become a claustrophobic vortex of leads clues details and tantalizing dead ends. A master manipulator of both the media and the police the killer who branded himself Zodiac - replete with a T-shirt-ready symbol of a crossed circle - followed up his killing with taunting cipher-ridden communiques to the San Francisco Chronicle. It is here that we meet Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) a neophyte editorial cartoonist who will eventually lose his family and risk his sanity in an obsessive determination to find out the identity of the killer whose total number of victims remains unknown. Driven initially by the seductive puzzles supplied by Zodiac Graysmith is subsequently motivated by an overwhelming sense of justice - which he claims is endemic to the newspaper cartoonists trade and finally by the fact that the solution always seems just one scrap of information beyond reach.Among other things Zodiac is a stellar feat of adaptation. Where Graysmiths two books on the case - Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked - read less like conventional true-crime procedurals than obsessive-compulsive scrapbooks of facts rumours testimony and hearsay James Vanderbilts script transforms this ultimate lack of cohesion and clarity into Zodiacs true subject.As Graysmith delves ever more deeply into the seeping bog of the case -which became both a media event and a kind of mass panic in the Bay area between 69 and 72 - he is drawn into the wary orbit of the cops assigned to the case Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) the rumpled local semi-celebrity who inspired both Steve McQueens Bullitt and Clint Eastwoods (Dirty) Harry Callaghan - and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) a devoted flatfoot whose steely professionalism will ultimately melt under the heat generated by the case.Article Continued BelowIf one of the ironies in the movie is that the murderers casualties included more than the immediate victims of his cunning rampage Robert Downey Jr.s Paul Avery - a hipster substance-prone Chronicle journalist who will completely unravel after drawing the direct interest of the publicity-savvy serial killer - is one of the movies more explicit embodiments of collateral damage.While much has already been said about Zodiacs absence of Finchers typical visual acrobatics - there are none of Se7ens mind-of-a-serial-killer horrors and nothing of Fight Clubs baroque flourishes - this misses the point that the directors strength has always been in the details the skin-crawling intricacies of first-person psychosis or the insinuation of plot and character within elaborately realized environments.If Zodiac is the directors most accomplished movie its because the details are so seamlessly embedded within its larger purpose.To borrow the title of one of the filmmakers other movies Zodiac pulls you into one big dark panic room - and then closes the door behind you.Shot on icy high-definition video by Harris Savides Zodiac takes place mostly in cluttered and banal work environments the musty Chronicle newsroom with its industrial grey typewriters and rotary-dial phones and the various fluorescent-yellow police stations forensic labs and morgues where the scientific scrutiny of the cases unstoppable accumulation of minutiae becomes a kind of insanity that transcends even the actions of the man who is the object of it all.While the literal drama here is about crime solving the movie will resonate with anyone whos been seduced by an obsession. On one level the nearly three-hour movie resembles a kind of epic version of those grimly determined TV procedural dramas like Law amp; Order Homicide or CSI but with a crucial difference.Where those programs demonstrate an almost fetishistic faith in the problem-solving nature of information in Zodiac information is the real killer it leads nowhere but into more rooms with more infuriatingly fruitless information and it drowns its characters with the seductive possibility that theyre actually getting closer.Despite the torrent of tips leads alleged eyewitnesses and promising suspects (especially the calmly creepy pedophile Arthur Leigh Allen played by John Carroll Lynch) Zodiac always proves as opaque as the insane-making ciphers hes so fond of serving his pursuers. While Fincher has been famously criticized for demonstrating less interest in his actors than their function as visual objects in a frame in this movie hes attained an almost musical harmony with their quiet professionalism dogged efforts and bleary dissembling Ruffalo and Edwards are easily the most convincing pair of cops to appear in a movie since the period when Zodiac was set and its amazing to watch the reliably brilliant Downey navigate Averys turn from a cocky cynic into a quaking paranoid wreck. They live and breathe in this airless world and there are moments when you can almost smell the fatigue.While theres little doubt that Zodiac will probably leave many viewers in a state of agitated stimulation - although deliberately elliptical Zodiac is loaded with nightmarishly unshakeable scenes - Im willing to bet it will hold up quite handsomely to repeated viewings.And that may be its most impressive feat. It makes you want to study it even more closely in search of things you might have missed trailing after leads that flash by in the relentless momentum of going nowhere fast. If youre not careful it might make you obsessed.

Starring Robert Downey Jr. Jake Gyllenhaal Mark Ruffalo and John Carroll Lynch. Directed by David Fincher. (R. 155 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at sfgate.com/movies.) For all its dramatic flaws ""Zodiac"" deserves praise for not choosing the easy route. The story of the unsolved series of murders that paralyzed the Bay Area in the late 60s and early 70s ""Zodiac"" doesnt sensationalize or glamorize real-life events -- in fact it barely fictionalizes or even dramatizes them. The film takes place mainly in the fluorescent workaday world of the journalists and cops who tried to crack the case and its virtues like its failings are those of authenticity. It offers neither the illusion of a complete resolution nor -- and this is a big problem -- the structural organization that comes from a storytellers knowing how it all ends what it all means and what needs to be shown. [Podcast ""Zodiac"" historically accurate but flat.] For Bay Area viewers this is also a local story and director David Fincher is conscientious about getting those particulars right. Two brief shots of the Ferry Building show the old Embarcadero Freeway still intact and the filmmakers apparently know exactly when (and how) the Transamerica Pyramid was constructed. Bay Area locations such as Original Joes turn up in all their 1970s splendor and at least one actor (Mark Ruffalo) goes so far as to replicate the vocal mannerisms of a man known mainly by friends and family. I was in grammar school during the years depicted but the old-time newspaper men shown in the San Francisco Chronicle newsroom seem right -- with their white shirts tough guy faces and rolled-up sleeves. Its probably safe to say that the more you know the details of the Zodiac case the more youll appreciate the movie -- its adherence to the historic record its period atmosphere. Yet in the end these are the virtues of a documentary and as drama theres something strangely flat and enervating about the picture. At times ""Zodiac"" has a grim smeary look to it almost as if someone took an oily rag and wiped it across the lens and the story is equally murky and without focus. In recounting the failed investigation the filmmakers never quite locate the pulse of the movie. Three actors take turns in the spotlight as the film shifts its emphasis over the course of its 158-minute running time. Robert Downey Jr. plays Paul Avery the reporter who covered the story for San Franciscos greatest newspaper. Ruffalo plays David Toschi the detective heading the investigation. And Jake Gyllenhaal is Robert Graysmith the Chronicle cartoonist who became obsessed with the case and later wrote the book upon which the movie is based. If theres a running thread its in the movies suggestion that each man becomes in some way burned-out or driven mad by the pursuit. Actually that approach could have provided an organizing principle for the narrative except that the movie can only suggest it tepidly -- probably because its not really true. ""Zodiac"" is best appreciated as a showcase for fine acting especially that of Downey as the witty hard-drinking drug-taking Avery. Its a portrait of a man in the grip of an addiction someone funny and clever but full of pessimism and self-loathing someone who seems to see through everything including himself and knows hes riding the elevator of life all the way to the basement. After 20 years of these colorful detailed performances it might be time to stop thinking of Downey as quirky original or an eccentric favorite and start thinking of him as a significant American artist. Averys flashy journalism puts him into conflict with Toschi whos played by Ruffalo in a kind of Method Acting-meets-Columbo style. Hes mumbly and indistinct though he gets better as the film progresses and his scenes with Gyllenhaal in the last third are some of the best in the picture. Gyllenhaal by contrast gives a clean clear and meticulously detailed performance conveying in believable and illuminating ways the obsessive and detail-oriented nature of the characters mind. ""Zodiac"" never takes off but it never collapses. At times it becomes frustrating -- for example about 30 minutes are spent pursuing a lead that goes nowhere. Why bother putting that in the movie? At other times its easy to appreciate the opportunity to sit through a picture without being manipulated in the typical ways. Though something less than the sum of its parts its separate streams are at least mildly entertaining and its even better in those moments when the performances cut through the murk with extra vividness. Too bad John Carroll Lynch couldnt have entered the story more fully. As the prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen he is truly scary but to give him more of a role would have required making stuff up. That constraint -- nonfictions lack of access to the Making-Stuff-Up option -- is often the great weakness of true stories. -- Advisory Murder blood and strong language.

With Robert Downey Jr. Jake Gyllenhaal Mark Ruffalo. Director David Fincher (235). R Violence language drug material and brief sexual images. If the various authorities amateur sleuths and David Finchers new thriller ""Zodiac"" have it right one of my earliest assignments as a newspaper reporter was covering the investigation of the first Zodiac murder. The connection between San Franciscos notorious serial killer of the late 60s and early 70s and Cheri Jo Bates an 18-year-old community college student stabbed to death on her campus in late 1966 wasnt made until Zodiac was well into his spree in the Bay Area. And the link wasnt made by police 430 miles south in Bates hometown of Riverside Calif. But she has nevertheless been woven into the legend of Zodiac so much so that Fincher chose to include her murder in his movie. Its an awkward digression and merely adds time to an already overlong and unnecessarily detailed ""true crime"" movie. After countless dramatized revelations dead-end clues and red herrings ""Zodiac"" sums up decades of shoe-leather detective work and dogged journalism with an accusation against an early suspect who died of a heart attack in 1992. This man was never officially charged and all the murder cases attributed to Zodiac are still open. Without a persuasive ending ""Zodiac"" is an exercise in frustration. But before it hits the inevitable wall it does something better than most genre films even attempt It perfectly depicts the obsession that often overtakes cops and reporters involved in high-profile crimes. Im sure there were many obsessed with Zodiac but the movie focuses on three - San Francisco homicide detective David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) hard-nosed San Francisco Chronicle crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) the soft-spoken Chronicle cartoonist whose two books on Zodiac are the source material for the script. The first half of the movie belongs to Toschi and Avery who use each other in a kind of tense quasi-partnership. The second half is taken over by Graysmith after Avery leaves for another newspaper job and Toschi is caught up in a minor scandal. The shift from Avery to Graysmith is jolting because Downeys Avery is such a strong character and Gyllenhaals Graysmith is kind of creepy and self-serving. While preparing a six-month anniversary update on the Bates murder for the Riverside Press-Enterprise I immersed myself in the case looked at the autopsy photos (shed been stabbed 42 times) and spent hours with the girls father and her best friends. I began to feel as if I had known her and harbored my own fantasies of solving her murder. The obsession lingers.

Robert Downey Jr. left and Jake Gyllenhaal star in Zodiac. Photo Paramount Pictures Zodiac 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The most perverse thing about Zodiac isnt that its Hollywoods umpteenth serial-killer flick when such crimes are rare in reality. Its that Zodiac though based on actual crimes is one of the dullest of these films to date. Wheres Hannibal Lecter when we need him? Oh thats right -- hes in Hannibal Rising the fifth film based on that fictional serial killer. But whos counting -- including Zodiac director David Fincher who had a hit with the serial-killing Se7en? These tales tend to regale with steady doses of violence intercut by frantic investigations. But Finchers epic look at San Franciscos late-60s ""Zodiac"" killer quickly runs out of killings and sticks with obsessive cops and journalists on an increasingly cold trail that stretches for decades. Given the historical record -- and 2005s The Zodiac from other producers -- we already know their efforts wont produce an arrest. Futility is a problem especially when were asked to sit through almost three hours of it. On the upside the film seethes with period details and has a solid cast starting with Robert Downey Jr. as a drug-drenched police reporter at the San Francisco Chronicle. Just as driven are a meek cartoonist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and a cop (Mark Ruffalo). Give serial-killer plots this You dont get the blues from lack of new clues and the real self-named ""Zodiac"" offered many. Using newspapers as a conduit the killer sent terse letters and coded messages about crimes and soon became a media fixture. The disturbing thing is that this exposure may have fed the Zodiacs true hunger -- for attention -- and spurred more killings. Even when killings stop the films journalists and cops cant let the case go which is why it proceeds for another two hours. Although Downey and Ruffalo sell their feverish drive Gyllenhaal does not. Hes out of his league as amateur detective and his furious reciting of crime details sounds like a Trekker obsessing about starship designs. Earth calling Hollywood The serial-killer flick has been done to death so get over it. Or as Star Treks own William Shatner once said get a life. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals 4-Panel Abstract Wall Art by Jon Allen for 145 + free shipping Defiant LED Flashlight 3-Pack for 10 + pickup at Home Depot ThinkGeek Summer Clearance Sale Up to 65% off + free shipping...

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Have no doubts director David Fincher makes movies that rattle. Even when theyre not wholly successful (""Panic Room"") they can nag spook and linger after the closing credits roll. ""Se7en"" remains unpleasantly burrowed in the mind with its startling dispatch of one of the lead characters. The roundhouse mayhem of ""Fight Club"" (midnight tonight and Saturday at the Esquire Theatre) left this moviegoer sitting stunned in a parking lot. ""Zodiac"" Finchers latest stars Jake Gyllenhaal Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. That is just the top of the batting order in a fine roster that includes Brian Cox Anthony Edwards Philip Baker Hall and Denver native John Carroll Lynch pulling off the best (or worst?) sort of creepiness as a suspect. It is also the first Fincher movie based on true events. Screenwriter-producer James Vanderbilt bought the rights to Robert Graysmiths two nonfiction books about the killer who surfaced in the San Francisco area beginning in 1969 and sent letters taunting law enforcement until 1974. At two hours and 45 minutes ""Zodiac"" promises an epic sweep it never delivers. The film seems determined to mimic its hero Graysmiths dogged dedication to a case long after others have had to let it go. And the filmmakers carefully put forth conclusions about the cases that are still contested. Intelligently made the screenplay veers from the smarter ideas that would have made it resonate. Instead ""Zodiac"" sticks close to its characters. Unfortunately at a time in which cold-case agonies are the stuff of episodic television they arent galvanizing. Gyllenhaal plays Graysmith. A bright shy determined single father hes working as a political cartoonist at the San Francisco Chronicle when the first letter from the self-important murderer comes to the paper. The letter writer takes credit for an double homicide that took place in December 1968 and a murder-attempted murder committed on July 4 1969 in the northern California town of Vallejo. He also delivers a cryptogram coded with his future intentions. At the start of the movie we travel the streets of that town. Sparklers shed their light. Kids voices perfume the summer air. Knowing ""Zodiac"" is about a killer who hunts for prey makes this disembodied point of view uncomfortable. Roving the festive streets provokes anxiety especially as the car drifts toward the curb and a gawky guy. Are we cruising with the killer? To its credit ""Zodiac"" is not the kind of film that forces audiences into complicity with the killer. Instead its concerned with the pointed acts of brutality that wracked an area and tormented and teased the men charged with solving the crimes. ""Zodiac"" is an anti-exploitation flick. Almost. Its rated R for what the MPAA labels ""some strong killings."" You can be sure when that organization calls out onscreen actions they will be jarring. An attack on a couple at a lakefront is particularly brutal. Later a possible copycat incident involving a woman and her baby on a lone stretch of dark highway is nearly as miserable. What is missing are the powerful waves of grief that the murders set in motion. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards are San Francisco homicide detectives David Toschi and William Armstrong. They arrive at the scene of the first murder on SFPD turf. Robert Downey Jr. plays Paul Avery the Chronicle crime reporter who eventually tweaks the personal ire of Zodiac. With controlled nonchalance Downey makes his character the black sheep of the newsroom much the way his own magnetic appeal makes him an edgy presence in the movie. If Avery doesnt initially get the puppy-dog ways of Graysmith who hangs about his desk pawing for information its because Graysmith is something of a geek. (Yes the species predates the Internet boom-bust-boom.) He continues to work the coded messages and solve the case long after others have surrendered to exhaustion or duty or the bottle. ""Zodiac"" might have read the signs of the time better. Why for instance did that time period engender such agents of cruel dispatch? Three weeks after the Zodiacs first missives the Manson family struck. Instead this tale about a long-standing - still contested - cold case leaves one slightly chilly.

Zodiac Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2007) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/zodiac-2007,200,zodiac15,zodiac,rogerebert
"Killer instinct - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Killer instinct Suspenseful Zodiac is sign of directors new style Jake Gyllenhaal and Chloe Sevigny play characters on the trail of a serial killer in David Finchers ""Zodiac."" (merrick morton/paramount pictures) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 2 2007 ""Zodiac"" is as meticulous and absorbing as David Finchers other thrillers. In ""The Game "" ""Fight Club "" and ""Panic Room "" he placed a premium on painstaking craftsmanship that made them easy to get lost in. Even though none of those movies was as distinctly satisfying as his music videos the sensibility seemed completely new. He was a pop artist and a mechanical engineer and the movies were an impossible combination of the two laborious fun.But ""Zodiac"" based on James Vanderbilts deftly structured screenplay is a long work of completely sustained suspense and dark humor. The film reconstructs the still-unsolved nearly 40-year-old case of the so-called Zodiac murders which gripped the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It isnt concerned with the solution of the case so much as how the search for a solution undid the men trying to do the solving.The hunt begins after the killer who has been at large for several months writes to the San Francisco Chronicle demanding the editors publish his letter and the accompanying cryptogram. ( Its the first of several.) The editors hold long meetings over whether to run the puzzle and its a heady kick watching anonymous middle-aged white guys sitting around a conference room talking ethics in a Hollywood movie. The puzzle is printed and in a flurry of scenes everyone from the CIA to a married couple in Salinas tries to decipher it.This isnt Watergate but in many respects the movie feels like ""All the Presidents Men."" Here our Woodward and Bernstein are actually a composite of problem-solver types. Robert Downey Jr. plays Paul Avery  one of the papers more flamboyant staffers (those ascots those vests that facial topiary). Avery was a star crime reporter and he seems as driven and self-involved as the famous Washington Post duo. But as the case leads nowhere (the bodies mount and weeks drag into years) the dead ends plunge him into a career-ruining drink-and-drug-fueled funk. Downey doesnt overplay the downward spiral as much as hes probably entitled to. Its a smartly delicate performance.His co-worker at the Chronicle the editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith is more durable. Graysmith a divorced single dad a word freak and an Eagle Scout is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. As the years roll by and the case goes uncracked no one not even the blind date (Chloe Sevigny) he eventually marries bothers to tell the increasingly obsessed Gray-smith that theres no merit badge for sleuthing. (Graysmith wrote the book from which this movie was adapted; his subsequent book about the dead ""Hogans Heroes"" star Bob Crane was turned into Paul Schraders movie ""Auto Focus."" The Eagle Scout is into serious kink.) Gyllenhaall of course doesnt suggest Graysmith is a fetishist. Its just all-consuming work. The actors pop-eyed boyishness has never been better used. Hes like a Hardy brother with no idea what his Scouts instincts have gotten him into.Graysmith and Avery often butt heads with David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) one of the detectives on the case. For a change Ruffalo actually appears to be up to something. Hes put a lot of air in his voice but when he speaks its directly without the actors usual tics and stammers. In other words its believable that Ruffalos cop could have shown Steve McQueen how to be a detective in ""Bullitt"" as Toschi did in real life.Over 2 1/2 hours the movie divides its time among the cartoonist the reporter the detectives the killings and the manhunt. Abetting the chase are a troupe of solid actors doing starchy law enforcement (Anthony Edwards Elias Koteas Dermot Mulroney Donal Logue) some comic insinuation from the excellent character actor John Carroll Lynch and a delicious performance from Brian Cox as the pompous King of Torts Melvin Belli who relishes the opportunity to talk to Zodiac on live television.Breaks in the case come and go and the years fall away. As big and wide as the movies scope seems ""Zodiac"" is actually pretty myopic. The time line stretches from 1969 to 1991 but we dont see or hear much about Vietnam Watergate disco the Harvey Milk assassination or the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Other than footage of the construction of the Transamerica Tower its all Zodiac all the time.Its true that the inconclusiveness of the case keeps the movie from achieving any sort of finality. Even at 160-odd minutes it feels incomplete insofar as it has to acknowledge that its pulled us across time only to shrug. Nonetheless this is a stylistic turning point for the director. His typically grandiose filmmaking is introverted patient chillingly calm and sure of itself. Every shot has the deep matte texture that good digital filmmaking provides. The inventive cinematographer Harris Savides uses breathtakingly wide angles and intelligent contrasts of shadow and light to create an intense painterliness. (The lonely nightlife in Edward Hopper works comes to mind.)May everyone who plans on making ""Saw 12"" watch the gut-wrenching murder sequences in ""Zodiac"" and appreciate the astonishing unalloyed clarity of the filmmaking. These same young directors were presumably also weaned on Finchers ""Se7en"" that chicly apocalyptic serial killer flick that birthed a generation of amoral and visionless imitators. With that movie in mind people were remaking filthy horror classics of the 1970s to resemble the fashionable distress of Finchers thriller.""Zodiac"" is a kind of corrective remake of ""Se7en"" a renunciation of that earlier movies psychotic nihilism. That rejection extends to a neat sight gag. Fincher gives us a shot of a cardboard cutout for ""Dirty Harry"" that mocks the personal abyss that catching Zodiac becomes. ""He doesnt break cases"" it reads. ""He smashes them."" The irony is piquantly funny. The Zodiac case smashes just about every man who tries to break it.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

The running time of ""Zodiac"" may well be a function of its subject -- 156 minutes to span more than two decades from the late 1960s to the early 1990s when a serial killer who called himself Zodiac terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area and taunted his pursuers with coded messages. And theres another reason for the length. The scope of David Finchers intricate handsomely crafted film goes beyond the pursuit of the killer who was never found to the grindingly erratic nature of the investigation which became an obsession for two cops and two newspapermen in San Francisco. Indeed obsession is the real subject here and obsessing about anything briskly doesnt count. Yet the film also feels self-obsessed an intriguing drama that slowly devolves into a bleak meditation on the absence of dramatics. ""Zodiac"" was adapted by James Vanderbilt from the book of the same name by Robert Graysmith a former political cartoonist who was working for the San Francisco Chronicle when the case hit the news. In fact the Chronicle was part of the news one of three Bay Area newspapers to which the killer first sent letters boasting of his crimes. That makes the film as much a newspaper story as a police procedural. Dont think of Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell cavorting comically in ""His Girl Friday"" though. One of the two ink-stained wretches of this piece is Graysmith himself (Jake Gyllenhaal) a relative novice with a nerdy demeanor who is treated like an unpromising intern. The other is the Chronicles crime reporter Paul Avery a deep-dyed cynic but as played by Robert Downey Jr. a man whose mordant wit provides welcome relief from the films oppressive tone. ENLARGE The cops Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Inspector Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) operate in a parallel universe. They struggle to pull together evidence from Bay Area police forces and jurisdictions that barely communicate with one another let alone cooperate with one another while the Chronicle guys second-guess them follow their own leads and get in the way. Switching back and forth between the two panels of the diptych structure makes for repetitiveness but it does prove informative; one has a sense of intelligent highly motivated men making their way through endless mazes of clues intuitions misapprehensions and misinformation. (Crackpots copycats and deeply weird wannabes keep coming forward to insist theyd committed Zodiacs crimes.) As in many David Fincher films -- the most visually distinctive of which are ""Se7en"" ""Fight Club"" and ""The Panic Room"" -- the look is much of the medium. The distinctive cinematographer Harris Savides has used digital cameras to create a world of brooding moods thats slightly artificial elusively abstracted and not only in the films several spasms of murderous violence. The period evocations are vivid mens shaggy haircuts and long sideburns of course; plaid jackets; smoking allowed in the last six rows of commuter airplanes. And the performances are uniformly fine -- low-key for the cops steady-state acidulous for Mr. Downey and increasingly intense for Mr. Gyllenhaals Bobby a nerd who comes from behind to dominate the proceedings with his gift for ciphers and solitude. Yet the overall style is quite conventional and a vital elan is missing throughout except in Brian Coxs sly shrewd performance as the celebrity lawyer Melvin Belli. This silver-haired popinjay is self-absorbed to the nth degree but hes larger than life and a wonderfully shameless self-dramatizer. Wild Hogs Wild horses couldnt drag me to see ""Wild Hogs"" a second time but seeing it once can be a liberating experience. Not in the same sense that its four middle-class middle-aging buddies from suburban Cincinnati liberate themselves from work and family to recapture their youth during a road trip to California on their Harleys. The movie frees you of the belief that making it in Hollywood requires finely honed skills. If the writer and director of this coarsely honed sitcom could get hired then the studio doors must be wide open. The biker quartet consists of John Travolta Tim Allen Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy. Never mind what work they do since the movies gestures at characterization are rudimentary. What they do on the road is pretend to be tough run into real Hells Angels-style outlaws and by taking them on become the men they wanted to be. ""Wild Hogs"" which includes a cameo by a live revenant from ""Easy Rider"" gives a bad name to carpe diem but could have been worse; the trip might have started from Bangor. Black Snake Moan Craig Brewers ""Black Snake Moan"" is nothing if not ripe. And provocative at least until you see it. A black man stands menacingly over a white girl in the publicity stills; hes holding one end of a massive chain that encircles her waist. But you cant judge a potboiler by its lid. Yes Christina Riccis Rae is the town whore and a nymphomaniac whose spasms of desire announce themselves with twitchy music and amazing gyrations. And yes Samuel L. Jacksons Lazarus has his bitter side; a former bluesman hes got the blues since his young wife left him. But when the church-going Laz tells the bed-going Rae ""Im gonna cure you of your wickedness"" youd better believe that the emphasis is on a cure. Shes been abused hes been wounded. He fixes her she fixes him and they both redeem each other. Craig Brewers debut film ""Hustle and Flow"" celebrated a good-hearted pimp but his second feature isnt just a showcase for a whore with a heart of gold. Its a soft-core simulacrum with a heart of gold. For all the preposterous cliches of the plot which clanks as loudly as Lazs chain and for all the inertness of Justin Timberlakes performance as Raes brooding squeeze ""Black Snake Moan"" finds unchained energy in its foolishness and gives Mr. Jackson a chance to pluck a guitar and sing. Hes really good at it too. The music almost redeems the movie. Avenue Montaigne ""Avenue Montaigne"" a French-language bauble by Daniele Thompson sees an elegant Paris neighborhood through the eyes of a provincial gamin from Macon. As soon as she arrives in the capital sweet Jessica whos played with charming if insistent gaucherie by Cecile de France lands a waitressing job in a neighborhood cafe where the proprietor tells her helpfully ""Were a microcosm here."" Soon shes crossing paths with the areas most illustrious denizens -- a concert pianist who feels stifled by classical music a disconsolate collector whos selling his most precious objets dart a famous TV actress whose quest for a serious role (she wants to play Simone de Beauvoir in a film to be directed by Sydney Pollack) resembles a Feydeau farce. Its formula stuff to be sure but full of feeling for the sweep of the past as well as for the unsettled yearning present. Echoes of Juliette Greco Gilbert Becaud and Charles Aznavour haunt the sound track. The collector is played by Claude Brasseur whose father Pierre played the renowned romantic actor in ""Children of Paradise."" And Jessica could be descended from Leslie Carons Lise or indeed her Lili though she also brings to mind Audrey Tautous ""Amelie."" As cosms go this one is more macro than micro.    DVD TIP ""Two Girls and a Guy"" (1997) is Robert Downey Jr.s show even though the two girls are played by Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner. Hes a lying and mercurial Lothario whose past catches up with him when the two girls -- spirited young women actually -- discover theyve got the same boyfriend. James Toback wrote and directed this sex farce which is much smarter and more entertaining than it may sound.

Such would appear to be the case with ""Zodiac"" which is about the notorious never-solved San Francisco serial killings. But the film turns out to be an engrossing 2-1/2-hour ride - part police procedural part bogeyman thriller part crime blotter version of ""All the Presidents Men.""Director David Fincher is not known for his light touch. His most egregious film ""Se7en"" - that-slash and-burn thrill ride - was also alas highly influential; so was ""Fight Club."" He gives an artsy patina to pap.In ""Zodiac"" working from a script by James Vanderbilt he has decidedly toned down his act. His straight-ahead methodical direction isnt as flagrantly unsettling as much of his previous work but its more psychologically layered. In this film for the first time we feel for his characters when they bleed. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The film begins July 4 1969 when the Zodiac killer - whom we see only as a hulking masked marauder - shoots two teenagers in a lovers lane. A month later he sends ciphers to three San Francisco papers threatening to kill again unless they are published. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 He kills again of course this time a couple near a secluded lakeside picnic spot in Napa Valley. The murder is easily the movies most graphic and theres a good reason for this By impressing on us the horror of these killings Fincher thankfully does not need to up the ante any further as he racks up the body count.The cast of characters is sprawling and diverse. Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) is the San Francisco Chronicle crime reporter who becomes increasingly pulled into the case. With his goatee and scarves hes like a fop inquisitor - until eventually the grind of the investigation unravels him. The Chronicles cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an amateur sleuth who as the years tick by without an arrest becomes as obsessed as Avery. Sacrificing his family life and his job he sets out to write a book about the hunt for the killer and even offers up a solution. (His bestselling book is the basis for the screenplay.)The third major player in ""Zodiac"" is homicide inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) who enters the picture once the Zodiac killings begin in San Francisco. Although Toschi in real life was the basis for both the Steve McQueen character in ""Bullitt"" and Michael Douglass cop in ""The Streets of San Francisco"" Ruffalo wisely tamps down the showboaty side of this man. Ultimately he is as beleaguered by everyone else by the cold trails and dead ends of which we see plenty.The doggedness of the pursuit the painstaking accumulation of clues has its own inherent drama. Much of ""Zodiac"" involves people jabbering at each other rather than running around with guns. The real violence especially once the film moves into its second hour is emotional not physical.The excellent cast also includes Brian Cox as publicity hound attorney Melvin Belli John Carrol Lynch as a prime suspect Charles Fleischer as the suspects creepy associate and Philip Baker Hall as a besotted handwriting expert. They all give human weight to a grisly odyssey. Grade A- Rated R for some strong killings language drug material and brief sexual images.

"Zodiac A Sideways Look At the Pursuit of a Killer washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Zodiac A Sideways Look At the Pursuit of a Killer Jake Gyllenhaal as the obsessed writer and Chloe Sevigny as his wife. (By Merrick Morton -- Paramount Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 2 2007 ""Zodiac"" gets in trouble even before the title -- on its poster It stumbles though it tells the truth with a marketing slogan that reads ""Theres More Than One Way to Lose Your Life to a Killer."" Actually theres not. The only way that counts and the only way thats interesting is the old way which is getting killed by the killer. Everything else is bull and spare change. And thats exactly the problem with this movie Its not about a killer or his victims or the manhunt or the cops. Theyre all in it of course more or less. But its about a writer. Its about a young man named Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) who becomes so obsessed with it he gives up career and family time to pursue endless arcana. For his effort hes rewarded with a -- nervous breakdown? A descent into hell? A face-to-face with pure evil itself? Er no. His reward is a couple of bestsellers and a new life as a successful and widely admired crime writer plus the movie deal that resulted in this very film. A new way to ""lose your life to a killer""? It sounds more like a shattering thriller about a good career move The movie is not without value if its largely without drama. It evokes the fear that gripped the Bay City when a monster calling himself ""Zodiac"" was on the prowl emerging now and then from shadows to wreak ugly violence on the random innocent. Zodiac also had a nauseating flair for self-advertising and like his inspiration Jack the Ripper in the London Whitechapel of 1888 loved to send letters to the papers complete with boasts puzzles and misspellings. He needed an editor almost as badly as he needed an executioner. It also documents the way actual malfeasance enters pop culture and becomes a parody of itself. So sensational was a late Zodiac letter -- ""I shall wipe out a school bus some morning. just shoot out the front tire amp; then pick off the kiddies as they come bouncing out"" -- that it inspired the movie ""Dirty Harry"" with its Scorpio villain who brings his wrath to bear on a school bus but alas runs into Clint Eastwoods larger wrath. If that version of the story was infinitely satisfying in its melodramatic symmetry the reality never achieved such compelling closure. It just eventually ran out of steam. Thats a continual problem for ""Zodiac"" director David Fincher because way way too much of the film is guys sitting in a room talking about it over and over and over waiting for a climax that never comes. The movie makes clear the agonizing reality that a manhunt is 99.9 percent talking and record-checking. ""Zodiac"" gets off with a series of bangs by dramatizing the third of the Zodiac killers five ""canonical"" murders. On July 4 1969 two necking youngsters in a car thinking the universe full of love and hormones suspect little when another car pulls into lovers lane. They fail to notice the approach of a man with a gun but from point-blank range he dispatches evil in chunks moving at a thousand feet per second. One lives; the other dies. Its hideous and Fincher has a real gift for evoking the weight of the violence. But from there the scene moves to the newspaper world. Fincher also has a wonderful feel for life as it was lived in newsrooms and his vision of the Chronicles layout will make anybody who newspapered in the years before computers came in and turned the places into insurance-office pods achy with sentimentality. These were large filthy rooms that stank of decades worth of sweat smoke and ink punctuated by the weirdly hollow pop of copy being sent to composing by pneumatic tube; the people in these rooms tended to be large and filthy too but also somewhat mythic. Fincher working off a script by James Vanderbilt focuses on Graysmith a young cartoonist who watches in awe as the superstars deal with the issues. The central figure from that era is a flamboyant (he reminded me a little of John Wilkes Booth for some reason) crime reporter named Paul Avery with San Franciscos best Rolodex who knew everybody and could talk to anybody even if most people seemed to despise him. If ever a role called for Robert Downey Jr. this is the one and Downey with florid mannerisms and the total comfort of the newsroom star plays the part brilliantly. At this point we shift not to the investigation but to the investigation of the investigation as Downey chronicles the towns two most famous cops who are assigned the case. They are a detective with a famous upside-down speed-draw holster (said to have influenced Steve McQueens Frank Bullitt) named Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). Its a long trek however following not the streamlined truncated dull-parts-cut-out format of melodrama but the stuttery incoherent lurching consistent with messy reality. For example half an hour is spent on Zodiacs flirtation with mega-lawyer Melvin Belli all of which comes to nothing; 10 more minutes are used to examine the almost-killing of a young mother which may or may not be an authentic Zodiac event. Twice again the movie is lit by two incandescent scenes of violence which leave you shaken and disturbed a murderous assault on two people on a picnic and the execution-style killing of a taxi driver when the perpetrator is almost caught. Mostly ""Zodiac"" is people talking. Newsroom politics media politics police politics the friction between jurisdictions ranks factions theorists all the coming together of personalities and points of view in a massive police effort as tracked by a major journalistic effort are delineated. The thread that brings it all together is Graysmiths eventual submersion in the case until even though hes since married and had children (Chloe Sevigny is wasted as his wife) the case becomes his life. Thus in its second half the movie becomes essentially a brief for Graysmiths interpretation and solution of the mystery. Graysmith chooses a suspect and works to prove he is indeed the one. Is it convincing? Well yes even if the movie cheats by not evoking the full range of other suspects (Wikipedia lists 15 in all). Its nobodys fault that the movie cant end with a stunner but youve sat there for almost three hours and you think Is that it? Zodiac (170 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme violence drug material profanity brief sexual images.

Comments (1) Zodiac Rated R  157 minutes  2013 A dozen years after Seven director David Fincher again treats a serial killer only this time its a true story (adapted by James Vanderbilt from Robert Graysmiths autobiographical best seller) and not at all metaphysical. In some ways for better and for worse this is even more about Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal)--who became obsessed with solving the Zodiac killings that terrorized northern California in the late 60--than about the murderer. Im not convinced this had to be 157 minutes long so its all the more annoying when essential material gets elided (as in a sequence featuring an uncredited Ione Skye). But Fincher does keep this bubbling along ably assisted by a cast that includes Mark Ruffalo Robert Downey Jr. Chloe Sevigny Elias Koteas and Philip Baker Hall.

"Zodiac | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; zodiac ) Zodiac (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Zodiac is a police procedural - a sort of souped-up ultra-long episode of Law amp; Order. Based on the 1986 ""true crime"" book by Robert Graysmith the movie looks back on one of the nations most sinister unsolved crimes the Northern California serial killings by the so-called ""Zodiac killer."" Although no arrest was ever made and the case now resides on the SFPDs inactive list many journalists cops and investigators had their own ""favorite"" candidates for the identity of Zodiac. The movie follows the hunt by cartoonist-turned-writer Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) as he seeks to unmask the villain. To its credit Zodiac is faithful to its source material. However from a stylish director like David Fincher the straightforward no-frills approach is a little bit of a letdown. The digital photography is sharp but theres nothing remarkable about it. Theres no sense of the cinematic flair that has marked Finchers previous efforts (even Alien 3 for all of its faults was visually dynamic). One can count on one hand the number of flourishes apparent during the nearly three-hour running time. During its first hour Zodiac unfolds along three parallel trajectories. The killer systematically eliminates victims (the crimes are re-enacted based on the survivor testimony contained in Graysmiths book). The police led by detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) investigate and collect clues. And newspaper people like Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) and Graysmith fill the papers with speculation and fact. Then a little more than a third of the way through the book the Zodiac killers spree stops and the movie chronicles Graysmiths obsessive hunt to uncover his identity. He conducts interviews pours over old files and eventually comes up with the perfect suspect Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch) who is damned by circumstantial evidence. Zodiac does not promise an impartial perspective of the search for the killer. Since its based on Graysmiths book it represents the authors viewpoint and the facts are slanted in favor of his preferred suspect. Whether Allen was the Zodiac killer or not is something well never know (he died more than a decade ago) but the film stacks the deck in his favor to avoid being completely open ended. Certainly few who see this film will leave the theater frustrated by the real-world fact that the case remains unsolved. That Zodiac draws conclusions isnt its problem (to the degree that it has a problem) - the structure is. While the killer is active and the police investigation is in full throttle theres tension and momentum. Its a cat-and-mouse game. But when the focus shifts to Graysmith the film shifts into neutral. While theres a certain amount of fascination associated with following an investigator tracking down disintegrating leads and digging through mounds of old records its not cinematic and this at times makes the second half of Zodiac sluggish. Finchers attempts to create tension (anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing a creepy film buff who might be dangerous) inject suspense but the intensity level is low. As thrillers go most of Zodiac is more of a slow burn than an explosion - not necessarily a bad thing but it requires patience. The running length is problematic. Fincher is so determined to meticulously recreate Graysmiths investigation that he risks losing his audience. There are numerous dramatically effective sequences during the second half but the uneven pace results in stagnant periods. So where is Fincher in all of this? Zodiac has a generic look and feel that is at variance with what we have come to expect from the director. Even Finchers early music videos had more style than this. Thats not to say that the films direction is inept. Technically its fine and there are some nice helicopter shots (and a nifty time lapse sequence of a building being constructed) but theres nothing special about it. Its as if Fincher is saying ""Look I can do regular stuff too"" There was more menace and atmosphere in Spike Lees Summer of Sam another film about a real-life serial killer. The performances like Finchers direction are competent. Jake Gyllenhaal is understated as usual but thats appropriate for his low-key character. As Graysmiths obsession grows Gyllenhaal comes alive. Mark Ruffalo is very good at being petulant but has trouble with sincerity. Robert Downey Jr. once again plays the flamboyant rogue with alcohol/substance abuse problems. Art imitating life I suppose but he can do this kind of role in his sleep. Arguably the best performance belongs to John Carroll Lynch who captures Allens creepiness without doing anything overt. Brian Cox steals a few scenes as Melvin Belli (he even gets to make a Star Trek reference). Although the entirety of the movie spans 22 years from 1969 until 1991 the majority of the scenes transpire in 1969 and the early 70s and the film is at its most effective during those years. Zodiac becomes fragmented when it starts lurching ahead to highlight the ""big moments"" in Graysmiths investigation. Its difficult to be too harsh on Zodiac because the subject is interesting (such is often the case with serial killers) and it is fascinating to observe as the investigatory pieces fall into place. Ultimately however the length and uneven pacing are stumbling blocks with which an audience must contend. Patient viewers will be rewarded; others may wish for something with less subtlety and more verve.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

It makes us feel that chaos has been defeated and the forces of order restored. Zodiac David Finchers vastly intricate and dazzling drama about the hunt for the serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area starting in 1969 offers no such soothing closure and thats part of whats haunting about it. It spins your head in a new way luring you into a vortex and then deeper still fascinating us as much for what we dont know as what we do. Reenacting one of the most infamous ""cold"" cases in U.S. criminal history Fincher has broken with the fanciful mode of tawdry baroque opulence he employed in Fight Club Panic Room and his first serial-killer outing Seven. Zodiac is based on piles of documents culled from police records and its been made in a style of dogged almost fetishistic realism its suspense rooted in the scrappiest tidbits of bureaucratic protocol. Fincher refuses to squeeze the hunt for the Zodiac killer into tidy arcs. The revelations occur where they did and not where they didnt. In this movie its the killer who imposes order on things. As we watch two young people parked on a lovers lane are assaulted by a stranger who pulls up in his Mustang then fires a hail of bullets. Weeks later a letter appears in the offices of the San Francisco Chronicle. Its a confession written in blocky letters with details only the killer would know and signed with a logo that looks like a rifle sight; it also includes a page written in cipher code. Will cracking the code reveal the killers identity? (A high school teacher soon solves it. Answer -- no.) The Zodiac as he christens himself is a madman who promises to kill again but his ruthlessness is surpassed by his ingenuity as a new kind of urban sociopathic media terrorist. A procedural thriller for the information age Zodiac focuses on the complicated efforts by a handful of investigators to uncover his identity. Theres the Chronicles star crime reporter Paul Avery played by Robert Downey Jr. as a talented drunken flake who mouths off to superiors in a way that reminds you what newspaper journalists were once like and theres Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) the papers political cartoonist who kibitzes on the case for no good reason except that hes a moody hyper-curious lurker with a thing for puzzles. (The movie is based on two books by Graysmith.) Theres Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) a homicide inspector more earnest than inspired and his low-key partner William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). Legally the detectives have to coordinate almost every move with the surrounding districts (Napa Vallejo) and the result is a communication tangle thats one of the movies sly themes -- the way that information gets lost in a bureaucratic state. Re-creating the pre-tech grittiness of the 70s Fincher doesnt just get the cars and Top 40 tunes right. He gets the smoke-clogged offices with their blinking telephones the ugly wood paneling -- and more than that the dawn of the tabloid age when a serial killer could still set off shock waves. At times we might be watching a film by Sidney Lumet in his high fluorescent period or maybe the All the Presidents Men of deranged homicide. We see most of the Zodiacs murders and they are coldly horrific to behold (especially the stabbing of one couple by a lake) but the real story is the way that the killer uses the mass media to inflate the dark grandeur of his crimes. He creates a myth of himself like Jack the Ripper or Charles Manson and once that myth takes on a life of its own its not even clear that the murders hes bragging about are all his. (Theres no pattern to them.) The cops and reporters are looking for a killer but theyre also chasing a ghost. Zodiac never veers from its stoically gripping police-blotter tone yet it begins to take on the quality of a dream. Its an analogue of the post-9/11 world where the enemy is specific yet by virtue of his self-projection omnipresent and therefore impossible to pin down. As the 70s roll forward the investigators move on to other cases but Graysmith the amateur cant and Gyllenhaal who marinates his boyishness in quivery tension makes that obsession ours. Slithering into police libraries interviewing suspects tearing his family life apart hes eaten up by the need to know and he makes connections no one else does but does he solve the case? By the time he fastens on to a monster maybe the monster (and maybe not) Zodiac leaves us haunted by the knowledge that hes looking for something that cant be found a way to make the monsters go away.

But what happens to the obsessed when there is no resolution? David Finchers fascinating uncompromising ""Zodiac"" is about four men who became obsessed with capturing the legendary Bay Area serial killer known as the Zodiac. The case started in 1968 when two teenagers out on a date were shot in their car in Vallejo Calif. The girl was killed; the boy survived. The killer who taunted his pursuers with letters to local newspapers written in code struck again on the Fourth of July 1969 when he stabbed a couple picnicking by a lake in Napa County. His third strike came in San Francisco where he shot a cabdriver in the back of the head and narrowly escaped capture.Anyone who followed the story or who read Robert Graysmiths two best-selling books about the Zodiac knows that almost four decades later the case has not been solved. That fact alone places Finchers movie outside convention. Hollywood movies crave resolution no less than homicide detectives do but Fincher who played by the rules of the genre in his pitch-black serial-killer hit ""Se7en"" is after different game here. His movie based on the two books by Graysmith (hes the main character played by Jake Gyllenhaal) has its theory about who the killer was but its not ultimately about who done it or why. Its real theme is how uncertainty--not finding an answer--can bend someones life out of shape. Fincher who did his own detective work in the course of making the movie and even uncovered new clues is no less consumed with the minutiae of the case than his protagonists. The result is a movie about obsession made with an obsessive attention to detail.""Zodiac"" is meticulously crafted--Harris Savidess state-of-the-art digital cinematography has a richness indistinguishable from film--and it runs almost two hours and 40 minutes. Still the movie holds you in its grip from start to finish. Fincher boldly (and some may think perversely) withholds the emotional and forensic payoff were conditioned to expect from a big studio movie. ""Zodiac"" comes with its own built-in frustration. Perhaps for just that reason it keeps playing on in your head; it may take a while before you resolve your own feelings about the movie. But on its own dogged darkly seductive terms it seems to me Finchers best most mature work--not as flashy or thrilling (or self-regarding) as ""The Game"" or the promiscuously provocative ""Fight Club"" but one more deeply engaged with its characters. Its the first Fincher movie in which the style serves the subject rather than the other way around. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Gyllenhaals Graysmith is an awkward shy young San Francisco Chronicle political cartoonist whose love of puzzles hooks him on the case which he pursues with a single-minded fervor long after the trail goes cold and others abandon the hunt. Initially Gyllenhaal seems uncomfortable in the role--hes playing nerdiness instead of being a nerd--but he grows into the part. Robert Downey Jr. is the Chronicles ace crime reporter Paul Avery a caustic tormented journalist whose obsession with the Zodiac killer proves a toxic mix with his own spiraling alcoholism. The case also transforms the life of the SFPDs homicide detective Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) whose reputation is both burnished and tarnished by his pursuit of the killer and his more diffident partner William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) who is worn down by the endless frustrations of the hunt. The specter of the Zodiac consumes and contorts each of these men affecting their marriages their minds and their identities.Fincher pursues the story with the same bloodhound tenacity burrowing deep into the procedural details of detection his sharp eye alert to the psychological shifts of his characters. This is a new Fincher gone are the fantasy figures who populated his earlier films. The feverish emotional temperature is turned down to a simmer. He focuses his bravura technique less on the crimes of the Zodiac--though we see them in all their horror--than on the collateral damage that follows in their wake as the case sprawls from decade to decade haunting everyone it touches a riddle that refuses to come to rest.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis (Photo Merrick Morton/Courtesy of Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures) David Fincher the director of Zodiac is rumored to be a cold SOB but thats not a bad thing if youre a thriller specialist. A penchant for treating audiences like lab rats and actors like specimens in jars can even be an asset Finchers Se7en with its artfully rendered tableaux morts is a genre cornerstone a Louvre for necrophiliacs. Zodiacwhich centers on the hunt for a sociopath who beginning in the late sixties killed at random while taunting San Francisco Bay Area police and newspaper editors with hammy threats and bizarre cryptogramsisnt the same kind of tour de force. But in its roundabout elliptical way it gets at something transcendentally icky about the fetish for serial killers (and serial-killer hunters) that has grown only more common in this era of true-crime blogs and celebrity forensic scientists. Its a movie about the allure of grotesque puzzlesand about living with the bogeyman when the bogeyman in all likelihood no longer lives. SEE ALSO Backstory on the Zodiac Case It should be said that the movie itself feels like an unfinished puzzle. I dont know if vital connecting material was lopped out in the editing room (the thing still runs two and a half hours) or if the screenwriter James Vanderbilt couldnt find the right frame for all the minutiae in the rambling books Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked by the former editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith (played onscreen by Jake Gyllenhaal). But what begins like your basic police procedural becomes more and more choppy and diffuse. To a point thats intentional Zodiac was never caught and Fincher aims to creep you out with the lack of closure with the absence of a Dirty Harrystyle climax and windup (Dirty Harry being one of the myriad serial-killer thrillers that drew its inspirationif thats what you want to call itfrom the Zodiac case). But there are lapses in storytelling that dont seem like bold artistic choices. Its a little confusing who lives and dies after one Zodiac attack and the escape of a near victim happens entirely off-camera. Fincher it turns out is not a police-procedural-type guy. Hes not a people-type guy. Hes a mood ghoul. A great opening can carry you a long way though and Zodiac has a stunner an attack at night on a couple in a parked car thats among the most brilliantly cruel sequences Ive ever seen. Fincher has already chilled you to the bone with the combination of darkness distant fireworks (its July 4) and Donovans Hurdy Gurdy Man (singing songs of luuuhhh-huhhh-huuuuv). The druggy aura isnt overdone but the dark side of the counterculture is in the music and Finchers pacing in the way a second car pulls up in back and sitsand sits. The face of the figure that emergesout of a sudden bright lightis always on the brink of visibility but never quite And the shots when they come blast right through your head. The second murder set piece is in some ways the greaterand more perverseachievement in daylight in the open (in front of an endless vista) with only the sound of a woodpecker. Well theres one other sound the hooded Zodiac addressing the bound prone couple in almost reassuring tonesthe tones of a reluctant robber not a killer. He really was a sick fuck. The rest of the movie is purposely flatand to be honest I cant remember many scenes distinctly. They go by fast (sometimes too fast). The cinematographer Harris Savides uses a newfangled hi-def video camera and the lighting doesnt seem fussed-over. The excellent actorsamong them Anthony Edwards Elias Koteas Donal Logue and Dermot Mulroneytalk quickly and play it close to the vest in the best police-procedural style. As an investigative reporter who drifts into alcoholism and addiction Robert Downey Jr. blurts his lines and brightens every moment with his choirboy-gone-to-seed ingenuousness. Even when he plays a cynic theres something hopeful about him. The rumpled Mark Ruffalo plays a San Francisco detective who returns every year to the site of a cabdrivers murder and the actor carries a trace of that same boyish hurt. Come to think of it with the addition of Gyllenhaal this is a baby-faced central trio Unlike the obsessed cops and reporters in most noir pictures theyre in a different dimension than the sadist they pursue. John Carroll Lynch is Arthur Leigh Allen who might or might not have been the Zodiac but who is beyond any doubt a scary freak with an inner life the actor can only hint atbroadly. Fincher keeps him on the periphery which is dramatically unsatisfying but ups the eeriness quotient exponentially. As the nominal protagonist Gyllenhaal has a lot of pep but at times seems dazed even shell-shocked; I missed seeing what the real Graysmith claims in interviews that his dogged independent sleuthing came from the same place as his editorial cartoonsas moral outrage at injustice. But then I dont think Fincher can relate much to moral outrage. What occupies him is how to send you home antsy unsure of what youve seen but sure it was worse than you think. He gives you the existential willies. 1 2 3 Next Share this story...

An obsession that cannot be satisfied erodes the souls of the central characters in ""Zodiac"" a mesmerizing account of the infamous never-solved Bay Area serial killings as seen from the perspectives of several men who spent years trying to crack the case. Conveying an astonishing array of information across a long narrative arc while still maintaining dramatic rhythm and tension this adaptation of Robert Graysmiths bestseller reps by far director David Finchers most mature and accomplished work. It is decidedly not sensationalistic along the lines of ""Seven"" hardcore fans of which may be disappointed by new pics methodical nature and unavoidable inconclusiveness. But discerning auds worldwide will find deep satisfaction pointing to moderate but sustained B.O. given proper distrib nurturing. From the exceptional coherence with which James Vanderbilts script grapples with complex events and dozens of characters to the journalistic setting procedural format era in question and the very presence of David Shire as composer the cinematic touchstone for ""Zodiac"" is clearly ""All the Presidents Men."" And yet the feel of the new film is very different. Due to the extended timeframe West Coast setting working-class characters preponderance of rock songs and most decisively Harris Savides precise yet fluid HD camerawork the pic possesses a kind of seedy dreaminess that most strongly recalls another indelible epic of 70s California ""Boogie Nights."" Both films occupy that rarefied high ground where audacious artistry and nervy commercial filmmaking occasionally converge. Beginning with the startling July 4 1969 shooting of two teenagers in a makeout parking lot the pic jumps ahead to the moment a month later when the culprit sent portions of a cipher to three Bay Area newspapers and threatened to continue killing unless they were immediately published. Of course he went ahead anyway attacking another amorous couple by a lake in Napa. Unblinkingly filmed the daylight slashing is agonizing and bloody but is the last explicit sequence of its kind in the picture which then almost entirely assumes the points of view of those who struggled in vain to nail the taunting bedeviling psychopath. Just as the locus of ""Presidents Men"" was the Washington Post so the home base of ""Zodiac"" is a newsroom -- this time the San Francisco Chronicles a space where funkiness has won the battle with respectability and theres not a female reporter in sight. Goateed crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) with the air of a dissolute dandy takes on the case. Unofficially so does the papers bashful new cartoonist Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) who manages to deduce the meaning of the cipher and its reference to ""The Most Dangerous Game"" the short story and film about the hunting of mankind. Once the the self-named Zodiac strikes in San Francisco proper the city cops join the hunt led by homicide Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). Despite the fact the Zodiac provides hidden clues in his texts and leaves behind partial evidence at crime scenes the cops make little headway. Much of the early going is devoted to Toschi Avery and the self-appointed Graysmith trying to connect the dots while the public remains on edge. As the investigation fans out the cops attention is drawn to an uncouth hulking loner Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch) who has a history of ""touching"" youngsters. Despite uncanny ""coincidences"" (Allen wears a Zodiac watch and is a ""Most Dangerous Game"" fan) no conclusive proof ties him to the crimes so the search goes on. And on. After several years the trail has gone cold and those who have followed it are old before their time. Worst off is Avery whos a physical wreck -- a victim of his addictions and obsessions. By the late 70s Toschis star has fallen; hes been moved out of homicide his old partner Armstrongs earlier decision to quit having been proven prescient. Still Toschi is intermittently willing to help the ever-enthusiastic Graysmith who is now industriously retracing everyones steps with the intention of writing a book about the case. Graysmiths search leads him back to Allen and one encounter the earnest fellow has with a former Allen associate is breathtakingly suspenseful. Graysmiths eventual conclusions may possess an element of wish fulfillment but are about as convincing as circumstantial evidence will allow. Throughout the films 21/2 hours Fincher maintains the sort of locked-in ultra-focused hold on his material hes displayed before but with a touch that if not exactly gentle is less ferocious and overbearing. Due in part to the times at which certain scenes were shot as well as to the limpid quality of the HD images (""Zodiac"" is the latest big production shot with the Thomson Viper Filmstream Camera) a certain twilight afternoon-into-darkest-night atmosphere dominates appropriately enough given the characters slow descent into the murky abyss. Theres no showing off with technique this time no pandering to the publics baser instincts just extremely disciplined filmmaking in which the camera is always in exactly the right place. Notably imaginative are the transitions and means of conveying the passage of time marked at one point by the stop-frame construction of the landmark Transamerica Building. Playing the author of the book on which the film is based Gyllenhaal carries the burden of the large structure capably and lightly. Starting as an almost naive foil for Averys urbane cynicism Graysmith ultimately sustains his obsession longer than anyone and with endurance comes reward even if his complete immersion costs him his second wife (Chloe Sevigny). Downey richly amplifies Averys booze-and-drug-fueled glibness and later his descent into disease and disenchanted seclusion. Most resembling a young Columbo Ruffalo has a number of choice moments but the role seems oddly truncated; one doesnt really get the sense of a legendary cop who served as the inspiration for Steve McQueens character in ""Bullitt"" Clint Eastwoods ""Dirty Harry"" (itself based on the Zodiac murders and referenced herein) and Michael Douglas character in ""The Streets of San Francisco."" Performances and casting are impeccable down to the smallest role. Brian Cox socks over his extended cameo as San Franciscos showboating celebrity lawyer Melvin Belli. Also making striking impressions are Charles Fleischer as a strange film buff acquaintance of the possible killer Philip Baker Hall as an ostensibly reliable handwriting expert and above all Lynch as the unsettling prime suspect. On top of everything else ""Zodiac"" manages an almost unerringly accurate evocation of the workaday San Francisco of 35-40 years ago. Forget the distorted emphasis on hippies and flower-power that many such films indulge in; this is the city as it was experienced by most people who lived and worked there. For this hats off to production designer Donald Graham Burt costume designer Casey Storm and the hairstylists among many others. The only inaccuracy catchable on one viewing the too-early presence on the streets of diamond lanes which were not introduced until the 70s. Shires subtle score which comes increasingly into play as the action accelerates effectively complements the double-soundtracks worth of pop tunes headlined by Donovans ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" which hauntingly frames the picture.
