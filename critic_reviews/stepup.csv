Nabbed while trashing a school of arts hes sentenced to perform his community service there. Pretty ballet dancer Nora (Jenna Dewan) meanwhile is desperate to find a new dance partner but all the candidates are wimps. Hmmm where could she find a strong manly man whos easy on the eye and light on his feet? Like many films in the romance/dance genre Step Up makes a virtue of its predictability setting the stage for a dream scenario and fulfilling the wishes of its young audience. But while Tatum has rough charm Dewan is more dancer than actress and most of the peripheral characters - as they would put it - suck (Rachel Griffiths almost visibly grits her teeth throughout her dull turn as school principal). Several dance scenes are fantastic but with its wooden dialogue and pedestrian plotting this is more Save the Last Dance than Footloose.

Step Up shines in the dance not acting Updated 8/11/2006 1015 AM ET E-mail | Print | By Scott Bowles USA TODAY For a movie about dancing Step Up is pretty clumsy on its feet. That has nothing to do with the films musical numbers mind you. Step Ups blend of ballet and hip-hop is top-notch and its more graceful than recent teen dance flicks such as Save the Last Dance and You Got Served. BRING ON THE DANCE LESSONS Learn smoother moves The problem is in the scenes not accompanied by a thumping bass beat. Director Anne Fletcher a longtime choreographer making her directing debut has found young stars who appear to know their way around a dance floor but not a sound stage. Step Up dips from the well that seems to feed all Hollywood dance films forbidden love between a roughneck boy and a repressed girl drawn together by their common desire to shake their rumps. And theres nothing wrong with that template as long as you have actors who can both cut a rug and shed a tear. But our young heroes seem capable only of the former. The movie begins with Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) a break-dancing rebel from the wrong side of the tracks sneaking into and trashing a prep school for the performing arts. When hes caught hes forced to do community service as a janitor at the school where he meets the ballet prodigy Nora (Jenna Dewan). Nora is preparing her big dance number for her senior showcase when her partner injures his ankle. Who could possibly fill in at the 11th hour? The movie is full of pat plotlines and characters from the stern headmaster (Rachel Griffiths) to the disapproving mother (Deirdre Lovejoy) to the jerk boyfriend (Josh Henderson) who has to be dumped to make way for true love. But those arent what trip up the film. Its the uneven pacing and sudden changes of heart. One moment Tyler is done with dance and schooling; the next hes recruiting ballet performers. Mom doesnt want her daughter to dance -- until she sees a picture of the child in a leotard. And the climactic scene in which Tyler begs to be part of the Big Dance Number is unintentionally funny. There are a few highlights especially the performance by real-life Ramp;B singer Mario who plays an aspiring musician and makes a solid acting debut. And the score will have you tapping your feet. But its not enough to hoist a film this heavy on the dance floor.

Opening today Movie review ""Step Up 2 the Streets"" with Briana Evigan Robert Hoffman Will Kemp Cassie Ventura Danielle Polanco Christopher Scott. Directed by Jon M. Chu from a screenplay by Toni Ann Johnson and Karen Barna based on characters created by Duane Adler. 98 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language some suggestive material and brief violence. Several theaters. So did you know that Will Kemp is known as ""the James Dean of ballet""? I didnt know this but the Internet Movie Database does and it will surely be the most lasting bit of knowledge I take away from ""Step Up 2 the Streets"" a silly sort-of-sequel that never makes the case for not going straight to video. Kemp a fellow so ridiculously handsome you wonder why hes not playing a Disney prince somewhere is a dancer best known for starring in Matthew Bournes all-male ""Swan Lake"" (a lovely swan photo of him turns up in this movie just to give us balletomanes something to do). Here hes Blake the full-of-himself head of a Baltimore arts school and hes constantly making pronouncements and marching out of the room -- maybe to go get on a motorcycle and do some James Dean-like things off-camera? -- and after a while you might want to join him. Otherwise ""Step Up 2 the Streets"" goes through the motions of virtually every other dance-competition movie ever made (including ""How She Move"" in theaters mere weeks ago). Directed by Jon M. Chu its a warmed-over retread of 2006s ""Step Up."" Andie (Briana Evigan) is a troubled girl from the wrong part of town whos given an opportunity to straighten up at the Maryland School of the Arts. (Her audition scene is right out of ""Flashdance""; you almost expect her to pick up a welding torch in her spare time.) At the school she meets Chase (Robert Hoffman) a dancer at the school who just happens to be Blakes younger brother. Soon -- despite Blakes disapproval -- theyre forming their own hip-hop-flavored troupe and challenging in ""The Streets"" an urban dance contest featuring kids from Andies past. Everyone in the cast is a terrific dancer (particularly Kemp whose few brief seconds of dancing here are cruelly tantalizing) but not necessarily a charismatic actor. Adam G. Sevani is a pleasant exception; hes endearingly dorky as Andies friend Moose and he dances as if caught in his own personal strobe light. Leaving the dialogue scenes flat Chu puts all the movies energy into the dance sequences Theres an infectious samba at a party a riotous dance duel involving trampolines and a jittery rain-soaked finale that would have been more fun if Chu hadnt chosen to shoot it in the dark. ""This aint High School Musical "" yells an observer at one of the dance competitions. For better or worse it isnt.

Starring Channing Tatum Jenna Dewan Mario and Heavy D. Directed by Anne Fletcher. (PG-13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The dreary teen drama ""Step Up"" appears to be cobbled together from bits and pieces of successful movies. Like ""Fame"" it features a high school for the performing arts populated by kinetic kids with big hopes and dreams. The halls are alive with the sound of music. Shown moodily mopping them up is a young janitor with an extraordinary talent just waiting to be discovered. His name is not Will Hunting but Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum). Nora (Jenna Dewan) an aspiring ballerina at the school finds Tylers intuitive hip-hop moves liberating on the dance floor and off. If this plot point sounds familiar its because its from the surprise box-office hit ""Save the Last Dance."" Duane Adler who wrote ""Dance"" isnt likely to sue however since hes one of ""Step Ups"" screenwriters. If an idea has gotten young people into theaters once by all means pirouette it out again. A lot of movies are derivative. What makes ""Step Up"" particularly dispiriting is that it has almost nothing fresh to add. From the beginning you know everything that will transpire -- who will fall in love who will succeed against what obstacles even which character will die -- because youve seen it all before. Tyler is from the bad end of Baltimore Nora from the ritzy part. Now theres an original way to establish dramatic conflict. (How about portraying a fledgling couple from the same side of the tracks -- or from the tracks like ""The Boxcar Children?"") Tyler has been sentenced to community service as a custodian after he and his up-to-no-good pals from the hood break into Noras school and trash it. Making Tyler a white guy who acts black isnt original. Troy Garity pulled it off a lot better in ""Barbershop"" than Tatum does here. When Noras rehearsal partner is injured shortly before students are to be showcased in front of talent scouts theres no one available to fill in except the janitor -- even though half the school is prancing around en pointe. First-time director Anne Fletchers experience as a choreographer is evident in scenes of Nora and Tyler rehearsing. They have an improvised feel and provide the movie with its only spark. But as dance writer Janice Berman pointed out on these pages ""When it comes to classical ballet Step Up cant step away fast enough or far enough."" Youre supposed to believe that one look at Tylers freestyle moves and Noras years of classical training would go out the window. The emphasis is clear on the soundtrack where ""Swan Lake"" is the odd duck among a couple of dozen hip-hop songs and in casting pop music stars Mario and Heavy D in supporting roles. Tatum and Dewan show some chemistry on the dance floor but it dissipates during a romantic rendezvous on a pier. Theyre laughably stiff during Nora and Tylers first big kiss and a shot of the sun conveniently setting between their lips does nothing to make the moment magical. This shot is indicative of Fletchers lack of subtlety as a director. She crowds far too much into scenes making it difficult to know where you should be looking. I suggest at a different movie. -- Advisory Language and brief sexual content.

There are even fewer times it should be. But ""Step Up"" the latest dance-can-overcome-all flick makes doing so darn inviting. ""Hes a defiant rebel from the wrong side of Baltimores tracks. Shes a privileged dancer from an elite performing-arts school"" the notes begin. ""Their worlds couldnt be more different but when their fates collide the sparks between them fly igniting a hip-hop fueled fairy tale. ..."" Well you can guess the rest. I hoped the movie would elude the dread of the too-familiar to please in ways that while not ground-breaking worked their magic nonetheless. ""Step Up"" doesnt. Hyperbole it seems is the hobgoblin of overcompensating publicity departments. Indeed there are two class-crossed dancers Tyler Gage and Nora Clark played by Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan. And their fates do collide when Tyler has to perform community service at the Maryland School of the Arts where Nora is a top-dog senior. Tylers arrival coincides with an injury to Noras dance partner. Who will help her prep for the Senior Showcase? Not that rough guy with the moves standing in the janitors jumpsuit? Directed by Anne Fletcher (the choreographer who brung it to ""Bring It On"") ""Step Up"" enjoys some right moves when it comes to the dance numbers. There are energetic moments when the his-hers clash of free-style street dancing and ballet suggests the difference between graffiti and cursive. How the two be-fateds express themselves isnt so much with two foreign languages but with two approaches to the grammar of movement. Its the storytelling that keeps landing on its keister. Looking like a handsome grunt who just avoided recruiters trawling for fresh Marines Tyler is from the meaner streets of Baltimore. Hes the oldest of three foster kids who seem to be little more than meal and beer tickets for their stewards. At least thats how the cynical but sensitive Tyler sees it. Tylers closest friends are Mac (Damaine Radcliff) and Macs little bro Skinny played with chatterbox zest by DeShawn Washington. The movie nearly pulls a muscle straining to prove to its youth audience that it deserves its hip-hop heavy - and fun - soundtrack. Did the screenwriters forget that many of hip-hops avid consumers live on the not-so-mean cul-de-sacs circles and drives of the burbs? Its tough to maintain street cred and keep a PG-13 rating. ""Step Up"" tries treating grand theft auto as almost a lark the city cousin of cow-tipping. That is until late in the film when it turns serious. The vandalism that earns Tyler hours of community service isnt much of a ha-ha either. ""Step Up"" could be the love child of ""8 Mile"" and ""Save the Last Dance"" (which was also written by ""Step Up"" co-writer Duane Adler). Not least because the story is one of class even more than race. As much as Nora and Tyler may be different they each have a best friend who is African- American. And though their story never wows the film provides a multihued hint at where kids are - bound by music dance text messaging - in terms of race.

Comments Step Up This teen chick flick is so perfectly calculated I wouldnt be surprised if every i in the screenplay were dotted with a little heart. The setting is one of those performing-arts high schools where the kids do nothing all day but prepare for stardom; the heroine (Jenna Dewan) is a poor little rich girl destined to be a professional ballet dancer; the hero (Channing Tatum) is a streetwise bad boy who teaches her some hip-hop moves and forces her to get real.

"Its standard teen fare but Step Up can really move - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Its standard teen fare but Step Up can really move By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  August 11 2006 Hollywood cranks out so many formula teen flicks that its almost a shock to find one with a little snap crackle and pop. The dance musical ``Step Up"" doesnt represent anything that hasnt been done a thousand times before from the Mickey-and-Judy lets-put-on-a-show movies of the 1930s to the Disney Channels ``High School Musical.""You dont care while youre watching it though. Alive with infectious rhythm likable characters and slick dance moves ``Step Up"" gives cliches a good name.It helps that star Channing Tatum is in the words of the 20-something women fanning themselves behind me at the screening ``Omigod. So. Hot."" Tatum throws off a lot of charisma for an expressionless slab of muscle and between this confection his Duke Orsino in ``Shes the Man"" and the upcoming indie mean-streets drama ``A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" hes poised to break out.Fine by me since the kid can move. I cant figure out how he does it though Tatum looks as if they built him out of jumbo-size Legos but he dances like hes made of ball-bearings.He plays Tyler Gage  a no-hope white kid from Baltimores Hamden slums who dodges his nasty foster parents and boosts cars with pal Mac (Damaine Radcliff ) and Macs little brother Skinny (DeShawn Washington ). The thug life beckons but Tyler takes the rap when the trio break into a tony school for the arts one night; as punishment hes assigned community service on the schools janitorial squad.Weve already seen him slink and drop on a dance floor so its no big surprise what comes next Tyler gets a gander at ballet student Nora (Jenna Dewan ) and signs up to be her partner for the end-of-term showcase (her previous partner has sprained his ankle the weenie). Can a kid who never finishes anything see this one through?Will he gain the approval of the snooty school director (Rachel Griffiths  acting on autopilot)? Will Noras frosty mother (Deirdre Lovejoy ) stop with the Ivy League applications already and let her daughter dance? Will the gangbanger and the priss make beautiful plies together?If you dont know the answers you havent seen 2001s ``Save the Last Dance"" of which the new film is virtually a remake. Or youre either very young or very credulous and thus fall neatly into the movies target demographic. Yet ``Step Up"" has appeal beyond its crummy obvious screenplay because joy in physical movement courses through every frame.As befits a film directed by a choreographer -- Anne Fletcher  who worked on ``Bring It On"" ``Ice Princess"" and uh ``The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" -- ``Step Up"" finds dance everywhere on the basketball court in school hallways walking down the streets. In one scene Tyler hangs in the backyard with his foster-care sister (Alyson Stoner  one of the few kids to stand out in the ``Cheaper by the Dozen"" mob); he throws a combination at her just to see if the kid can do it she throws it back and suddenly theyve got a lovely little number going on.Theres also a rousing group dance at a nightclub and the final showcase is a bliss-inducing jam of massed bodies and hip-hop strings. The movie earns its high and in the process the actors are lent believable heat. When theyre standing still Tatum mostly broods and Dewan flares her nostrils but then they move in for the clinch and the girls in the back row just melt.There are lessons to be learned of course hard ones by Tylers street pals and romantic ones by the second-tier duo of Ramp;B singer Mario and Drew Sidora (``White Chicks"" ). Tyler has to decide how to pronounce ``pique"" before he can do one. The audience has to figure out why the leads are white when everyone else is black and whether that should bother them.All this is secondary to the curious pleasure of watching a large man dance with eerie suppleness and to the directors restless interest in how people move. Tatums career seems set but someone should give Fletcher a development deal stat. If she can turn harmless summer junk like ``Step Up"" into something special imagine what she could do with a real movie.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Shrewdly positioned as the last blast of summer 2006 Expect surprisingly upbeat B.O. returns if pics target demographic responds to the fresh cast a formulaic but engaging storyline and a smoking soundtrack from rap and hip-hop luminaries. Deftly scrambling elements from ""Fame"" and ""Save the Last Dance"" ""Step Up"" impresses as crowd-pleasing teen-skewing fare with possible crossover appeal. Shrewdly positioned as the last blast of summer 2006 Touchstone presentation offers a contemporary take on the warhorse plot about attractive opposites who bring out the best in each other as improbably complementary dance partners. Expect surprisingly upbeat B.O. returns if pics target demographic responds to the fresh cast a formulaic but engaging storyline and a smoking soundtrack from rap and hip-hop luminaries. Making her debut as a feature helmer choreographer Anne Fletcher (""Bring It On"") neatly balances grit and gloss while rendering Baltimore locales in a style best described as romanticized urban realism. Tyler Gage (Channing Tatum) -- whos pretty fly for a white guy -- is a moody neer-do-well who finds joy in performing gyrations as a free-style street dancer. When hes not hearty-partying he hangs with his buddies -- burly Mac (Damaine Radcliff) and his kid brother Skinny (DeShawn Washington) -- and helps them steal cars because apparently he has nothing better to do. When the three homies break into the Maryland School for the Arts and exuberantly trash an auditorium Tyler is the only one whos caught. Sentenced to 100 hours of community service he returns to the school as a part-time janitor -- just in time to help Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan) a dance student whose partner twists his ankle before the schools Senior Showcase. Naturally they have nothing in common Nora is fiercely focused and goal-oriented and lives with her well-to-do mom (Deirdre Lovejoy); Tyler is an aimless slacker who resides in the seedy apartment of his none-too-attentive foster parents. Just as naturally they soon are making smooth moves on and off the dance floor. Minor impediments sporadically interrupt their budding bliss but theres never any real doubt that eventually theyll wow the crowd at the big show. ""Step Up"" isnt exactly a cliche-free zone. Scripters Duane Adler (who co-wrote ""Save the Last Dance"") and Melissa Rosenberg sprinkle stereotypes and stock situations across acres of familiar territory so that seemingly frosty authority figures (like the school director played by an under-utilized Rachel Griffiths) become sympathetically supportive and even a surly chop-shop owner (rapper-actor Heavy D) is revealed as a sensitive supporter of the arts. Even so the well-cast leads are more than appealing enough to encourage a rooting interest. Better still they obviously do their own dancing and do it very well. As Tyler Tatum (who unfortunately bears a slight resemblance to Vanilla Ice in some scenes) goes beyond traditional sensitive-hunkiness to convey streetwise humor and affecting shadings of pathos. Dewan is credible and creditable while running the gamut from steely determination to tremulous vulnerability. Standout supporting players include Ramp;B performer Mario as a musically gifted student who never forgets his roots and Drew Sidora as an ambitious singer. With strong support from ace lenser Michael Seresin (whose credits include the original ""Fame"") and editor Nancy Richardson (""Selena"") Fletcher keeps the pic pulsating with knockout dance sequences spirited transitions and an overall sense of energetic enthusiasm. On a few occasions she cleverly devises similarly framed but starkly contrasting scenes to emphasize the distance between the worlds in which Tyler and Nora live. And every so often she achieves a level of grace and exuberance not unlike that of a classic MGM musical.

By Christy Lemire updated 8/10/2006 24323 PM ET 2006-08-10T184323 Print Font + - REVIEW Take ""Fame"" and suck out all the sex and nudity take ""Romeo and Juliet"" and drain it of the preteen suicide and iambic pentameter and you have ""Step Up"" a thoroughly formulaic but mildly enjoyable dance movie. Josh Hartnett look-alike Channing Tatum stars as Tyler a tough kid from a Baltimore foster home who gets arrested during a vandalism spree with his buddies at a prestigious arts school and is sentenced to perform 200 hours of community service there. Jenna Dewan who resembles a pre-Scientology Katie Holmes stars as Nora a privileged ballerina at the school whos obsessed with getting her senior showcase piece just right in hopes that it will land her a spot with an important dance company. Of course theyre unexpectedly drawn to each other through their shared love of dance even though allies on both sides disapprove of their pairing. (Rachel Griffiths is appropriately condescending as the schools dean; Damaine Radcliff and DaShawn Washington provide a few laughs as the friends who feel Tyler has abandoned them.) Tyler ends up filling in during rehearsals when Noras partner injures his ankle -- a classic premise for all song-and-dance movies -- and the two fuse styles while falling in love in a series of obligatory montage sequences. He teaches her his Vanilla Ice moves; she teaches him to plie and pirouette and gets him thinking that maybe attending this school wouldnt be so bad after all. And who could blame him? The place is buzzing with non-threatening artistic expression. Students play the violin and harmonize in the hallways -- theyre gonna live forever Theyre gonna learn how to fly But you can sort of see the appeal of ""Step Up"" especially during the dead of summer. Its totally mindless eye candy Everyones strikingly great-looking everyones preternaturally talented. And its a decent excuse to trot out a variety of random musical figures past and present including Heavy D as a friendly neighborhood gangster Ramp;B star Mario as an aspiring producer and former Ashlee Simpson flame Josh Henderson as a wannabe pop singer. Advertise Advertise Advertise Video Step Up What are the chances of these people ever sharing the screen again? ""Step Up"" is the first feature from choreographer-turned-director Anne Fletcher so at least the dance sequences are refreshing and high-energy. Thats more than we can say for the script which was co-written by Duane Adler -- who also wrote ""Save the Last Dance"" yet another film that ""Step Up"" so obviously resembles -- and Melissa Rosenberg. Cliched talk about following your dreams gives way to an event that takes the movie in a dark direction which will subsequently provide renewed inspiration for everyone involved. Clearly ""Step Up"" isnt for the jaded. But regardless of your internal state the movie will make you think about your exterior. It will inspire you to put down the fork get off the couch and attempt to get your body in shape so that you too can wear a wife-beater tank top wherever you go with complete confidence.

"Step Up Dreary Dancing washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Step Up Dreary Dancing A familiar routine Jenna Dewan finds a last-minute dance partner and more in Channing Tatum. (By Phillip Caruso -- Buena Vista Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 11 2006 So what makes a great dance movie? The quick and easy answer very little youll find in ""Step Up"" about a boy from the wrong side of the tracks with freestyle moves and a prissy student at an elite dance school who needs a replacement partner fast. ""Step Up"" lacks the passion for dance found in the great films of the genre (the entire Astaire-Rogers canon) the kinda-great (""Dirty Dancing"" ""Footloose"") and even the guiltily enjoyable (""Flashdance""). And it fails to do what those classics do transfer the performers passion for dance to the audience. Think of the way Gene Kelly clearly loves pirouetting through puddles as hes ""Singin in the Rain"" about being in love-love-love. The way John Travolta moves like silver mercury in ""Saturday Night Fever"" with the sparkly-eyed confidence that he owns the disco floor. And not just the dance steps but the acting conveys that foot-tapping enthusiasm. Simply the way Jennifer Grey looks at Patrick Swayze as he rocks that pelvis in ""Dirty Dancing"" or how Kevin Bacon sweats sweet rebellion as he sneakers his way into the heart of Lori Singer in ""Footloose."" In ""Step Up"" the couples love of dance isnt primary or soulful. At the beginning shes already considering her Plan B in case a dance career doesnt materialize; hes just as happy on the basketball court as the dance floor. It seems neither would suffer if he or she missed a week of dancing; imagine Fred and Gingers spiritual dissolution if the ballroom were closed for even a day. Even 2001s formulaic ""Save the Last Dance"" starring Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas -- which ""Step Up"" has a distracting almost legally actionable similarity to -- managed to convey an enthusiasm for dance to the audience. Romance is always at the center of these movies even the bad ones. Which is why we know from the start of this film -- which is set and was filmed in Baltimore -- that Tyler (Channing Tatum) and Nora (Jenna Dewan) are romantically pre-locked and loaded for each other. They collide when Tyler who is forced to perform community service at the Maryland School of Arts catches Noras eye as she prepares for her schools annual showcase. When her dance partner injures his ankle Nora searches in vain for a substitute. The only available partners dont have the strength to hold her lifts. But then -- holy 42nd Street -- theres Tyler mopping in the background the very handsome boy she just spied showing off his moves to his pals in the parking lot. Do we get the picture? Tatum the hunky object of Amanda Byness fancy in ""Shes the Man"" and an engaging basketballer in ""Coach Carter"" is the best thing about this uninspired formula-thon. Put that down to more than cute-lug presence. As Tyler he has some nifty routines that suggest his spine is made of rubber and he clearly knows a thing or two about physical comedy. As Nora Dewan -- a former back up dancer for Janet Jackson -- can perform maneuvers (as the great sports writer Dan Jenkins once said) that only my cat can do. As far as the acting goes Tatum seems to be doing a combination of Vanilla Ice and Eminem but the fusion is forced; Dewans performance is vanilla too -- with plain-Jane sprinkles. In the movies one all-too-briefly-enjoyable section the naturally gifted Tyler tries to figure out his arabesques from his piques while the disciplined classically trained Nora attempts to get down with his unorthodox routines. Their initial awkwardness is engaging and these are the scenes where we feel something for them. First-time director Anne Fletcher a veteran movie choreographer is clearly in her element here; so is Tatum whose initial uncertainty suggests a baggy-jeaned wild animal caught in the floodlights. Alas most of ""Step Up"" takes place away from the dance floor. Tyler and Nora of course become increasingly attracted to each other. (The Love Connection Moment? When their faces draw close and a shaft of sunlight glints in the space between their lips.) And you can set your watch to the remaining beats including the Fabricated Tiff (Tyler says Nora uses people; Nora wails that she cant trust him) and the Sad Montage in which we cross-cut between the two as each stares meaningfully into the middle distance convinced the affair is over to a syrupy ballad. Rachel Griffiths the quirky memorable Australian actress who played the haunted Brenda Chenowith in ""Six Feet Under"" is underused in the film as the schools fussy director. And as Tylers best friend Mac -- and the movies comic relief -- Damaine Radcliff becomes unintentionally funny during an over-the-top jealous rant at Tyler for seeing so much of Nora. Its unlikely the filmmakers intended a gay-crush subplot but thats how it comes off. By the time that happens weve already given up on making any meaningful connection with these characters -- our dance with them is long over. Step Up (98 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for adult themes brief violence and sexual innuendo.

Theres usually a class factor a competitive element a disapproving authority figure or perhaps all three. Step Up -- Fame on Beat Street played against the grim West Bawlmer canvas of The Wire -- tips its backward ball cap to those elements. (Indeed the core story has been recycled by writer Duane Adler from his own Save the Last Dance.) But Step under the sure hand of director-choreographer Anne Fletcher quickly discovers its own virtuoso charms. Two of them are its leads Channing Tatum as budding criminal Tyler -- all slot eyes and thug shrugs until he hits the dance floor -- and Jenna Dewan as Nora a rich kid shooting for that elusive chance to dance. The meet-cute When Noras partner is injured Tyler whos trudging through some court-ordered janitorial work convinces her he can sub. But Step doesnt dwell on class-crossed romance Its more concerned with the pirouetting mini-betrayals and miracle catches of partnership. Tatum has a bracing rectangular naturalness and easy chemistry with the lithe Dewan on the floor and off. Their dance styles never really jell and the movie is lazy-vague on the actual art form privileging will over skill. But the pair is fused by the films pulsing energy which is both sincere and irresistible.
