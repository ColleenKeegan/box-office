Comments (1) Bulletproof Monk A martial arts master (Chow Yun-fat) mentors a New York pickpocket (Seann William Scott) and together they battle an octogenarian Nazi in a wheelchair who commands a team of musclebound bouncers in bad suits. Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris wrote the mildly cornball script adapting a comic book series from Flypaper Press; the fight scenes are routine the humor juvenile and the Toronto locales rendered drab through muddy cinematography. The film plays off Chows imperturbable persona but the Tibetan philosophy boils down to the paradox of hot dogs coming ten to a package while buns are sold in sets of eight.

"Bulletproof Monk is American Pie for the kung-fu set. Slate Sign In Sign Up Bulletproof Monk is American Pie for the kung-fu set. Bulletproof Monk is American Pie for the kung-fu set. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 18 2003 233 PM Slouching Tiger Bulletproof Monk is a kung-fu version of American Pie. By David Edelstein Fists of Stiffler As a rule I dont like to attack other critics but how in hell did the pedestrian Bulletproof Monk (MGM) get such warmly tolerant reviews? The movie means to be Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (2000) for the American Pie (1999) audience--which wouldnt be so bad if it had any decent kung-fu or funny lines. There were 10-year-olds at the theater in back of me who knew the movie reeked I could sense their bodies slackening as they sadly marked time until The Matrix Reloaded. Seann William Scott the guy who played Stifler in American Pie is an acrobatic pickpocket who becomes the protege of a century-old Tibetan Buddhist monk (Chow Yun-Fat) with supernatural powers. The odd couple banters dully (""This is America"" the kid tells the monk--on what is clearly a Toronto avenue) then fights off an elderly (but still kicking) Nazi (Karel Roden) and his blond-bitch daughter (Victoria Smurfit) wholl stop at nothing to get a sacred scroll that somehow has the power to cleanse the world of ""inferior races."" Advertisement From its opening in which two monks (and their obvious stand-ins) somersault over each other on a rope bridge over a painfully fake gorge the movie has the feel of an afternoon Japanese kiddie series--or it would if the sequence didnt end with a line of Tibetan monks getting machine-gunned by Nazis. The director Paul Hunter is another A-list music-video director who can barely cobble together a Grade C movie. He has no idea where to put the camera for dramatic impact or how to move people around in the frame Every set-up is flat and two-dimensional and every fight is chopped into scores of little kicks and punches and leaps that dont cut together. (I felt sorry for the good editor Robert K. Lambert whose credits include Three Kings [1999]--I dont know how he managed to keep from sneaking out and getting on a plane.) The leering Stifler--I mean Scott--is rather amusing as an action hero but after a great entrance (he picks the pocket of an undercover cop then when nailed picks the key to the cops handcuffs) he isnt given any witty moves. He tells the monk that he learned to fight at the ""Golden Palace"" which turns out to be a crumbling Chinese movie theater where he works as a projectionist (and lives on a mattress). That might have been the cue for him to showcase (and parody) old fighting styles from Bruce Lee to Jackie Chan to Jet Li. But his fighting--what you can see of it in the millisecond cuts anyway--is no different from anyone elses. He steals the show though from Chow Yun-Fat whose English diction is so horrible he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger sound like Henry Higgins. Why not just let Chow speak in Cantonese? Or give him fewer lines? Or dub him even? Anything would be better than hearing one of the coolest actors on the planet ask a onetime teen-sex-comedy co-star ""Kong you sepmyporogy?"" (i.e. ""Can you accept my apology?""). The amazing thing is that this shambles was co-produced by John Woo--who must want to destroy the career of the actor whose career in A Better Tomorrow (1986) he helped to launch. Yeah they made a ton of junky movies in Hong Kong but those were dazzlingly fluid and high-flying junky movies. This American retread has the same sort of hack plot but none of the bravura. It makes them look like monkeys and not bulletproof ones. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

"Kung Fu Hooey Chow Yun-Fats Mixed-Up Monk washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Kung Fu Hooey Chow Yun-Fats Mixed-Up Monk Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday April 16 2003 ""Bulletproof Monk"" produces strong reactions. One might be ""Oh my."" Or how about ""Hmm."" Then theres always ""My goodness."" Finally the circumstances cry out for a heartfelt ""Well wasnt that something."" On a positive note one might note the return of the great Asian star Chow Yun-Fat to the aegis of his discoverer developer and mentor John Woo who helped produce this film. On a negative note one might note that the great Woo didnt direct it; that task fell to Paul Hunter -- or should I say that task fell on Paul Hunter. This is another example -- the recent unlamented ""Dreamcatcher"" being the most glaring -- of a movie chockablock with too many elements. Whats it about? Whats it not about? Its about an ageless Tibetan monk protecting an ancient scroll from Nazis. Its about a young punk who talks out of the side of his mouth learning a craft and making a career choice. Its about a wicked blond gal who can fu some kung. Its about a director who clearly saw ""A Clockwork Orange"" at an impressionable age. Its about torture chambers plots to control the world kung fu movies and so forth and so on. Its about one from Column A one from Column B one from Column 11 one from Column Thirteenty-ninety one from Venus and one from the Core. Chow gets to be charming presumably his enticement for joining this rickety crusade. He reached world stardom as a stoic gun-toter but in the American phase of his career he has tried to exile the nihilism in exchange for an actual personality. In this one hes more like a combination of Jiminy Cricket and Miyagi of ""The Karate Kid"" than he is like the hitman in ""The Replacement Killers."" He gets to crinkle his eyes and make jokes and extend a hand to youth. The plot has him as a Tibetan monk whose sacred task is to guard that scroll thing possession of which somehow yields world domination. The physics are a little hazy. But now 60 years into his task hes wandering the world (the scroll isnt in a safe-deposit box no its in that leather pouch he carries with him) in search of the next guardian. For some reason that has to do more with market forces than Eastern transcendentalism that choice is one New York droog named Kar played by Seann William Scott that crooked-smile guy from the ""American Pie"" movies. But meanwhile that old Nazi (Karel Roden) his granddaughter (the blond Victoria Smurfit) and assorted thuggish henchmen in Armani suits are still trying to glom onto the scroll. Meanwhile a chick named Jade (Jamie King) is hanging around kung fuing it up too. Well it never makes much sense. Okay you say its martial arts it doesnt have to make sense. Fair enough. But I think the film would have been helped even within the narrow scope of its ambitions if instead of the genial Chow it had starred an authentic martial arts practitioner. And it would have helped if instead of the angularly amusing Scott the kid role had also gone to someone who knew a kung from a fu. As it is the fighting sequences are all computer-assisted. Theyre not young Jackie Chan exhibitions of blinding speed grace courage and stamina; rather theyre some kid sitting at a computer terminal hitting keys that cause gravity and physics and logic to take a nap while Chow corkscrews through the air 17 times does a double back flip and kicks somebodys teeth out. Hey Jackie Chan could do that for real. Bulletproof Monk (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for stylized violence.

Chow Yun-Fat and Seann William Scott star in the anemic Bulletproof Monk. Directed by Paul Hunter (moving up to his feature debut direct from rock videos) the tale has a comic-book source. But it has a few more diversions than the equally pulpy Daredevil which you should still dare your enemies to see. Of course some of these diversions are ridiculous but what do you expect in April when movie releases hit a pre-summer lull? Review of the movie Bulletproof Monk ( out of four) We begin with Nazis in 1943 Tibet (those German compasses arent what they used to be) and proceed to a modern-day metropolis. The monk Chow plays is protecting a scroll that prevents him from aging. He teams up with a new fanny-kicking disciple Seann William Scott of two American Pies and one Dude Wheres My Car? Street-smart Scott tempers his pickpocketing ways as he tries to figure out whether a spoiled rich girl may have more character than it first appears (Jamie King formerly known as model James King). Before the ultimate baddies are dispatched a few lackeys beat up on a theater owner played by always great-to-see Mako. In a just society the theater would be playing Mako in 1966s Oscar-nominated The Sand Pebbles a far better bet on DVD than this movie is in theaters. Monk aside this is not a movie that sparks questions about the meaning of life. Well maybe one Dude wheres my Zen? (Opens today nationwide.

HANDOUT PHOTO Photo HANDOUT Buddhist monk who can throw a mean punch / Chow Yun-Fat an appealing lead 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Bulletproof Monk Action. Starring Chow Yun-Fat and Seann William Scott. Directed by Paul Hunter. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 103 minutes.) ""Bulletproof Monk"" has more going for it than a promising title. It has a life and style that other buddy action movies lack -- plus moldy subterranean locations straight out of a video or cartoon fantasy. It also has a first-time director Paul Hunter who didnt approach the material cynically but actually tried to make a good picture -- and succeeded. Most importantly ""Bulletproof Monk"" has Chow Yun-Fat as the title character a Tibetan monk who was entrusted 60 years ago to protect an ancient scroll. The scroll is a little like Tolkiens ring in that it can grant unlimited power and guarantees eternal youth to whoever possesses it. As the Monk With No Name Chow gives the movie an appealing center. Hes more robust than the average monk and he has a nice face to look at for almost two hours. What makes Chows face nice is the vast quantity of private amusement he brings to his performance. His inner twinkle a familiar aspect of his charm as an actor is put to good use here. The monk is especially amused by a young pickpocket who robs him. He takes in young Kar (Seann William Scott) with a Buddha-like interior hilarity recognizing him for a thief and a scoundrel but also seeing spunk and monks like spunk. The monk starts going everywhere Kar goes sizing him up talking to him measuring him as a possible successor. He does this in between fighting off waves of attackers as an ancient Nazi (Karel Roden) and his sexy granddaughter (Victoria Smurfit) keep sending assault squads to steal the scroll. ""Bulletproof Monk"" is on solid ground early on when the monk turns up inside Kars apartment and Kar tries to throw him out. Without dropping a bowl of cereal the monk is able to duck Kars blows falling all the way back on his heels and then rocking back to an upright position. Its a tasteful use of computer graphics. Kar is the biggest role yet for Scott (""American Pie"") and he responds with a commitment and wholehearted earnestness. Put simply Scott treats this role as if somebody just handed him Hamlet. He is present in every moment as alert as a small animal and equally bright-eyed and cute in a scruffy sort of way. Hes the terrier to Chows Great Dane and the two make a good team. Jaime King (formerly known as James King) rounds out the crew in control as a kind of damaged ice princess. ""Bulletproof Monk"" is based on a three-comic series published in the late 90s. Perhaps because there were only three of them the movie story doesnt feel overburdened. Advisory This movie contains graphic violence including scenes of torture.

I havent found much anticipatory consternation in Internet chat rooms over whether the actor who plays the title role will do justice to the character. Still with little to lose this dispiritingly mediocre production manages to lose it and I dont mean in a Zen all-is-nothing way. Junky ""Monk"" directed by commercial- and music-video-oriented Paul Hunter like a series of 60-second ads for the ""Crouching Tiger"" school of stunts is as ungainly in its jammed-together East-meets-West-ness as Steven Seagal in a yoga pose. The back story establishes the ancient Tibetan origins of the BPM and gets viewers used to the sight of a moonfaced Chow Yun-Fat in a buzz cut lumbering around in a flapping ""Matrix""-ian greatcoat; the present story finds the BPM in grungy urban America (requiring set dressing for an identifiably well-kempt Toronto) where he selects a punky rogue - a pickpocket and fan of Hong Kong martial-arts movies who calls himself Kar - as his successor-in-training. The punk also becomes the monks partner in a mission to protect an ancient scroll that contains the most important knowledge in the universe from falling into the hands of a cartoony old Nazi (""15 Minutes"" Karel Roden). Seann William Scott plays the disciple with the same bulletproof-slacker demeanor that carried him through ""American Pie"" and ""Road Trip."" Theres no explaining why Scott was selected to be repositioned and remuscled into an action hero. Then again theres no explaining why pouty Revlon spokesmodel Jaime (formerly known as James) King was selected to play a tough chick who becomes Kars girlie. Or why Chow Yun-Fat isnt monk-kicking his agent right about now while meditating on his Hollywood career Dude wheres my karma?

Not surprisingly based on a comic book series by Brett Lewis and R.A. Jones pic hurtles along at a pace designed by vet music vid and ad helmer Paul Hunter to engage short attention spans. Epitomizing how boys fantasies have taken over much of the action-adventure genre ""Bulletproof Monk"" tells the unbelievable saga of a Tibetan monk passing on the source of all-powerful knowledge to a couple of callow American youth. Not surprisingly based on a comic book series by Brett Lewis and R.A. Jones (whom pic fails to credit) pic hurtles along at a pace designed by vet music vid and ad helmer Paul Hunter to engage short attention spans. Only adults will likely object to the innumerable plot question marks coming off the screen like so many kung-fu kicks to the head. Solid pre-teen and teen turnouts are assured in early weeks but MGM is shrewd to trot this one out before it is upstaged by ""The Matrix Reloaded."" Equally shrewd is Chow Yun-Fat making a return to English-language movies after his last role in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" But theres little thats memorable about his perf here as the Monk With No Name. Chow seems to be deliberately playing to a much younger crowd marking a long drop for him from his great blistering roles under helmer John Woo who (along with partner Terence Chang) serves here as one of the many producers. As if to recall the ""Crouching Tiger"" connection action erupts in 1942 Tibet where the Monk carries on some vertiginous martial arts practice with his Master (Roger Yuan) on a rope bridge. The Master chooses the Monk to be the next guardian of a scroll with immense powers (of a kind never fully explained) and passes the mantle on to him. A nice perk for any scroll guardian is that the task stops the aging process. Downside however is that the job involves being constantly hunted down by lots of bad guys. The prime hunter is a real doozy lending pic some unintended camp appeal. Even though historically Nazi troops never invaded the Himalayan territory here the Storm Troopers led by the ruthless Struker (Karel Roden) appear and gun down the Master. However they are unable to grab the scroll away from the Monk who escapes by leaping off a cliff. Sixty years later the action continues in the streets of an unnamed North American city (savvy viewers will correctly recognize it as part Toronto part Vancouver) cutting between the Monk being pursued by henchmen -- who look like theyre out of central casting -- and Kar (Seann William Scott) a pickpocket being chased by cops. With their script already loaded with signs that narrative cohesion is on holiday writers Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris set up a strained situation in which Kar actually knows martial arts. Its an especially awkward adaptation of the original comic which depicts Kar as a teenage Tibetan exile whose subsequent response to the needs of the Monk follows naturally from his character. In this version an inordinate amount of time is spent with the Monk just trying to convince Kar that he has gifts and is capable of confirming the prophecies that make him the next rightful carrier of the scroll. Just as strained is how Bad Girl (Jaime King) actually a good little rich girl named Jade in the daytime interacts with a suspicious Aryan blonde woman named Nina (Victoria Smurfit) at an exhibit of the Human Rights Organization which turns out to be a front for the diabolical schemes of the now-wizened Strucker still lusting for the potent scroll. Pic ends up sampling bites from several dishes including teen movie staples American-style (read subdued) versions of H.K.-style fighting and a Baroque demonstration that Hollywood has come full circle in its gallery of evildoers returning once again to the old Nazi chestnut. Chows patented brand of action heroism is absent here and instead he is always imparting wisdom and motivation to Kar who doesnt seem worth all of the fuss. King having changed her first name from James to the oddly spelled Jaime completely grabs the spotlight away from Scott with her sizzling glances and self-sure attitude. As always with Asian-inspired American actioners theres a trade-off Staging and editing of the fights (choreographed by Wong Wai Leung) is quite tame by H.K. standards but visual effects -- with a few exceptions -- are aces. Production designer Deborah Evans pulls out all the stops with Strukers high-tech torture dungeon but Eric Serras score is a poor blend of cutesy ditties and mock-Chinese licks.
